He attended the University of Mississippi where he was in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. McConnell co-founded Beanland in Oxford, Mississippi in 1985 with guitarist Bill McCrory. After some early shuffling, the band's line-up consisted of McConnell and McCrory on guitar, John Hermann on keyboards, Ron Lewis on bass, and Harry Peel on drums. The band recorded a self-titled debut album in 1991 and toured extensively, mainly around the south and southwest, playing blues- oriented rock as part of the nascent early-1990s jamband renaissance. McConnell went on to play for several years in the country rock band Kudzu Kings, eventually leaving to devote his time to a guitar store he opened in Oxford. In 2002, following Widespread Panic guitarist Michael Houser's diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, McConnell and saxophone player Randall Bramblett were asked to accompany Widespread Panic on the band's summer tour. Initially McConnell sat in for a few songs per show to add support to Houser's playing, however when Houser was unable to complete the tour McConnell filled in as the lead guitarist. McConnell was named as the new lead guitarist in the band following Houser's death in August 2002. McConnell served as Widespread Panic's lead guitarist for four years from 2002 to 2006, recording two studio albums and three live albums with the band.

According to Lang's preface, this version of this fairy tale from the Middle East or Central Asia was translated and adapted from Traditions Populaires de l'Asie Mineure by Carnoy et Nicolaides (Paris: Maison-neuve, 1889). Synopsis The king despairs because his castle is surrounded by wasteland, instead of a fruitful garden. Advised that the remedy is a head gardener \\"whose forefathers were also gardeners\\", he finds such a man. Under this gardener's care the land does flourish, but a new problem arises. The princess loves the gardener's son ‚Äì and will marry no one else. After she refuses her father's choice of a husband (the prime minister's son), he contrives a contest to settle the matter: the two men must go to a far destination and the first to return shall marry the princess. They do not go off on an equal footing. The Minister's son is equipped with a fine horse and gold, while the gardener's son is given a lame horse and copper. Traveling swiftly, the minister's son encounters a woman in rags. Weak and starving, she begs for his help. He spurns her. The gardener's son then encounters the woman. Generously, he gives her his purse and invites her to ride behind him. At the next city, heralds announce that the sultan is sick, and that whoever cures him can name the reward. The woman, who is a witch, instructs the boy: find and slay three particular dogs, burn them and collect their ashes, then make way to the sultan. Place the dying sultan in a cauldron over a roaring fire, and boil him right down to his bones. Finally, arrange the bones properly and scatter the dogs' ashes over them. The gardener's son does all these things and the sultan revives, in full hearty youth. Exactly as the witch suggested, the gardener's son chooses the bronze ring for his reward and will accept nothing else. This ring contains a djinni who grants any wish. Now the gardener's son continues his journey in a fabulous sailing ship, with a cargo of gems, sails of brocade and a hull of gold, crewed by a dozen handsome sailors, each dressed as richly as a king ‚Äì all gifts of the bronze ring. Eventually he meets his rival, who has spent all his fortune. Unrecognized, the gardener's son offers to supply his rival with a ship - on the condition that the skin of his back be branded with the imprint of the bronze ring, heated in a fire. Once that is done, the gardener's son asks the ring to prepare a ship with half-rotten timbers painted black, ragged sails and a maimed and sickly crew. In this ship the prime minister's son returns, and claims his bride from the king. As the unhappy princess' wedding is being prepared, the king looks out on the harbor and wonders at the gleaming gold ship sailing into it. He is so taken by the sight of its captain (the gardener's son) that he invites him to the wedding and, after closer inspection, actually invites him to give away the bride. The gardener's son agrees, but when he sees the intended groom he objects, telling the king that the man is not worthy of the princess, being nothing more than his own slave. The prime minister's son denies this, but the brand of the bronze ring on his back serves as proof of the claim. The gardener's son marries the delighted princess that day with the king's blessing. They have a short period of happiness. Meanwhile, a student of the black arts has come to learn about the djinni of the bronze ring. When the prince sails off for a trip in his golden ship, he persuades the princess to trade him the ring for some red fish. Once he has the ring, he wishes the prince's boat from gold into rotten wood, his crew from princely appearing men into hideous slaves, and the cargo of gems into ravenous black cats. (In the original French source, the magician is a Jew and the debased crew become Negroes. Modern editions of the Blue Fairy Book tend to omit these details.) Realizing that an enemy must now have his bronze ring, the prince sails on until he comes to an island inhabited by mice. The Mouse Queen sends an envoy to ask that the ship sail away with its terrible cargo of cats. The prince agrees, on the condition that his bronze ring be found and returned to him. The Mouse Queen contacts all the mice of the world, three of whom know that the magician keeps the bronze ring in his pocket when awake, and in his mouth when asleep. The three go to retrieve the ring. One of them tickles the sleeping magician's nose with her tail, and he expels the ring from his mouth with a sneeze. After some misadventures, the mice manage to return the ring to the prince, who restores his golden vessel and hurries home to the princess. He captures the magician and has the man broken into pieces by being tied to the tail of a savage mule.

Geography  The area of Ceglie Messapica is located between the Murge and the Upper Salento: its typical elements include trulli, farms, lamie (typical southern single room square dwellings), rupestrian churches, carsic caves, dolinas, specchie and paretoni (remains of city walls), dry-stone walls, olive groves, vineyards, maquis shrub, ancient oak trees, cattle pastures and arable land.  History  According to legend, it was founded by the Pelasgi, to whom belonged the megalithic structures known as specchie. After the arrival of Greek colonists around 700 BC, it received the name of Kail√¨a (). Nearby the village were extraurban sanctuaries dedicated to the God Apollo (near the modern church of San Rocco) and Venus (on the Montevicoli hill). The city was the military capital of the Messapi (the civil capital being located in the nearby Oria), and fought against the Greek city Taranto in the latter's attempt to gain a passage to the Adriatic Sea. The Messapic Ceglie had some 40,000 inhabitants. In Roman times it was already decaying, and in the Middle Ages was a small village known as Celie de Galdo, with a little castle. After several minor families, in 1584 its fief was given to the Sanseverino family, who enlarged the castle and founded two convents for the Capuchines (now disappeared) and for the Dominicans.  Main sights  Numerous archaeological remains of the ancient Messapi civilization were found in Ceglie's area. It had four lines of walls, the inner one having a perimeter of .

Early life He was born in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England, then part of County Durham. He joined the Royal Navy in 1823 at age twelve and rose in the ranks, becoming a lieutenant in 1835, commander in 1841, and captain in 1842. China Collinson was in command of the Lady Bentinck, a vessel of 1800 tons burden and 520 horsepower, when it appeared with the Phlegethon off Chapoo, causing a \\"sensation\\". On 1 April 1842, the British Plenipotentiary of Trade Henry Pottinger reported that Collinson, as commander of the Nemesis based in Chusan, had contributed to a successful skirmish with Chinese troops on the island of Taisam near Ningbo in February of that year. As commander of HMS Plover, and with the aid of Lt Henry Kellett in HMS Starling, he surveyed the China coast from 1842-46, producing charts upon which all successors were based. HMS Plover commanded by Collinson from 1842 to 1846 during his survey of the coast of China Bering Strait The three expeditions sent in 1848 to locate Sir John Franklin all failed. In 1850 Collinson was instructed to look for him by sailing through the Bering Strait while Horatio Austin and others would use the normal route through the Parry Channel. He was given HMS Enterprise and was to be accompanied by Commander Robert McClure commanding HMS Investigator. They left Plymouth in January 1850. After becoming separated off the coast of Chile the two ships became independent. (McClure got to the Bering Strait first and was frozen in on Banks Island. When he was rescued and taken to England he became the first person to cross the Northwest Passage). When Collinson reached the Bering Strait and learned that McClure was ahead of him he turned back and spent the winter in Hong Kong. He returned to Bering Strait in mid-July 1851 and sailed east along the coast. On 29 August he was off the coast of Banks Island and saw an open strait tending northeast. This was the Prince of Wales Strait. He entered the strait thinking that he might have found the northwest passage but after a while he saw a flagpole on a hill. Under the flagstaff was a message saying that McClure had wintered here the previous year. Collinson pushed on a little beyond McClure's maximum before he was blocked by ice. Returning south he found another message saying that McClure had passed that point only 18 days before but it did not mention McClure's plan to circumnavigate the island. He went a little further southeast and chose winter quarters at Minto Inlet. Here he found another message left by one of McClure's sledging parties. In the spring of 1852 he sent a sledge party north to Melville Island where they found tracks from an unknown traveler (these were McClure's men who were frozen in to the west.) On 5 August he was freed from the ice and went along the south coast of Victoria Island into the Coronation Gulf, the easternmost point reached by a ship from the Bering Strait. He wintered at Cambridge Bay on the southeast coast of Victoria Island. In the spring of 1853 he led a sledge party to the easternmost point on the island (Point Pelly). A little later some Inuit drew them a map of the area to the east. On the map was a ship. If Collinson had not disregarded this, or had had a proper interpreter, he might have sent a sledge party east and found some of Franklin's men, if they were still alive. He returned through Bering Strait and around the Cape of Good Hope. At the cape (January 1855) he learned of Rae's report that Franklin had been lost just to the east of where he had turned back. Collinson's reputation is lower than it perhaps should be. The problems are that McClure was always there first, his constant quarrels with his officers and bad luck. Roald Amundsen praised him for navigating a large ship through waters that were difficult for Amundsen's small ship. His account of the voyage was published six years after his death by his brother, Thomas Bernard Collinson.Heath, Philip. \\"Thomas Bernard Collinson (1821‚Äì1902)\\". cox.net Later life He was awarded the Founder's Gold Medal by the Royal Geographical Society in 1858, knighted in 1875, and made an admiral on the retired list in the same year.

It lies on the Storrington to Broadford Bridge road, 2.6 miles (4.2 km) north of Storrington. The parish covers an area of 1733 hectares (4279 acres). In the 2001 census 3315 people lived in 1476 households, of whom 1383 were economically active. At the 2011 Census the population of Nutbourne was included and totalled 3,375. Places of worship St Mary's Church is the grade I listed Anglican parish church. Sport The village has football and croquet teams and is home to West Chiltington & Thakeham Cricket Club. Not all sports are played at the village's Recreation Ground next to the Village Hall. There is also a flourishing tennis club also adjacent to the recreation ground. West Chiltington Golf Club was another sporting enclave within the parish but this closed in early 2016 after steadily losing revenue following damage due to two poor winters. Village band West Chiltington Silver Band in 1937 West Chiltington Silver Band was formed in 1908 by landscape gardener and Salvation Army Bandsmen Mr. Juden of West Chiltington. He formed the band with Mr. P. Slater, a builder and Mr. Edwin Pullen, a wheelwright, who lent them ¬£20 to buy some instruments. Mr. Pullen went to London, toured the music shops, and returned home with enough instruments for all ten members. Ed Pullen didn‚Äôt actually play an instrument but used to walk in front of the band carrying the flag. Most of the players had no idea of music when they joined, but by Christmas of 1908 they were proficient enough to give their first performance. They gave a concert of hymns and carols under the leadership of Mr. Juden, who remained their conductor for the next five years. Mr. Nash followed him as conductor and then by Mr. Chatfield, who remained for 20 to 30 years until 1950. The band started to enter competitions in 1930, and competed in the Brighton Music Festival. On only its second attempt it won a second prize. Many more prizes were to follow in the coming years, hence the name ‚ÄòSilver Band‚Äô, due to the amount of silverware they won. The band‚Äôs silver instruments were to come later. The band owes much to a local family, the Slaters. Phil (Grandfather) Slater and his eldest son Albert were founder members and there were four other Slater brothers who also played. Between them they played cornet, tenor horn, baritone and trombone, and were later joined by other members of their families. Albert took on the role of conductor in 1950 and also taught ex- conductor Doug Golds to play. The last Slater to play in the band was Reg, son of Fred, one of the original brothers. He left in the early nineties. Doug Golds is now the longest serving member of the band. He joined in 1945 when he was twelve and was given a cornet to practise on, which he had to share with another boy, Jimmy Weeks. They had it for a week each but Doug got so fed up with not being able to practise enough that he asked what else he could play. He was given an old dilapidated tenor horn, much in need of attention, and has been playing the tenor ever since. Doug has had a good spell in front of the band too - stepped into the breach after the sudden retirement of Tony Deacon. In September 2006 the band recruited Annette Clifford as conductor and musical director. July 2008 marked the band's centenary. Vineyards Church Street West Chiltington is unusual in the South of England in that within its parish boundaries it has three established vineyards. Friar's is tiny and not well known outside the village. Nutbourne is more well known locally and is gradually changing its grape varieties from Germanic types (Sylvaner and Muller-Thurgau) to French ones (Pinot Noir and Chardonnay) but the vineyard of international fame is Nyetimber. Nyetimber is based on an old manor which reputedly was part of the dowry of Anne of Cleves when she married Henry VIII. The first vintage in 1992 was chosen for the Queen's Golden Jubilee dinner. It has recently expanded substantially so that second growths are now in place. The second growth vineyards are located between Petworth and Midhurst. The First Growth 2003 was crowned \\"Champion of Worldwide Sparkling Wines\\" (2009) by the Italian wine magazine Euposia using a blind tasting test. The 2003 vintage has won six awards to date including the Euposia award; the latest being a silver medal at the Decanter World Wine Awards 2010.

Rick Moranis was the host for the ceremonies, which were broadcast on CBC Television from 9 pm Eastern. Nominations were announced 12 February 1992. Bryan Adams was nominated in 7 categories to set a Juno record, while Tom Cochrane received nominations in 6. Adams sparked controversy in the Canadian music industry several months earlier when he openly criticised Canadian content regulations when his album project, Waking Up the Neighbours, was disqualified as Canadian for radio airplay purposes. That album was created largely with the help of non-Canadian producer Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, therefore the songs fell below the legal Canadian content threshold. However, Adams qualified for the 1992 Juno nominations as an individual Canadian citizen. The 1992 Juno Awards thus became viewed as a showdown between Adams and Tom Cochrane, as the latter met Canadian content requirements. When all the 1992 Juno Awards were presented, Tom Cochrane was the major winner with 4 Junos, compared to 3 for Adams. 1992's awards also featured an unprecedented three-way tie for winners in the Best Jazz Album category.

It is the second most populated town of the province after Brindisi, and has a population (2016) of 40,227. History According to a folk etymology, the name Fasano derives from the \\"Faso\\", a large wild columbus dove (also represented on the civic coat of arms) which drank from the fogge, which was a type of swamp or pool in the open air formed from the water that flowed down from the surrounding hills. This area where the pool once was is now a communal garden. Via Appia, the road used to go from Brindisi to Rome during ancient times runs along Fasano's costal frazioni, including Savelletri and is visible today. Geography Location It marks the border between the Salento and the Metropolitan City of Bari. It lies about from all three of the provincial capitals in Apulia, namely Bari, Taranto and Brindisi. The municipality borders with Alberobello (BA), Cisternino, Locorotondo (BA), Monopoli (BA) and Ostuni. It counts the hamlets (frazioni) of Canale di Pirro, Laureto, Montalbano, Pezze di Greco, Pozzo Faceto, Savelletri, Selva di Fasano, Speziale, Torre Canne and Torre Spaccata. Environment Fasano is situated in an extended area with secular olive trees and its territory extends from hills to the sea with rich Mediterranean vegetation. Coming down from hills the town of Fasano occupies a dominant position in the valley which then leads down to the sea: coastal resorts include Savelletri with its beaches, the archaeological digs at Gnatia and a golf course and the quaint fishing town of Torre Canne. The coast is characterized by a peaceful atmosphere that prevails despite growing tourism. Around Fasano are Pezze di Greco, Montalbano, Speziale and Pozzo Faceto, centres of secular olive cultivation; and a range of medieval fortified masserie, or farmhouses, aimed at agricultural tourism.

He has published over 20 anthologies of poetry to date. His poetry frequently deals with social commentary and society's adoration for science. His lyrics praise nature and his native country. He has also translated poetry from Slavic languages (Polish, Macedonian, Czech). Traat writes about the indigenous Estonian population. His central topics are the changes and the developments of Estonian rural life in the course of centuries, with an emphasis on people's ethical choices. In Trees Were, Trees Were Tender Brothers (1979), a young protagonist has to wage a struggle to keep a farm running, something he never desired to do.http://elm.einst.ee/issue/24/views-freedom-mats-traat Pasqueflower, Antidote for Sadness (1982/uncensored version 1990) covers the fate of ancient Livonians, conquered and formally aligning with the Christian invaders, while maintaining pagan convictions, and the problems of rural life during the stagnation era Estonian SSR. Dance around the Steam Boiler (1971; originally a film script, that was finally accomplished in 1988) illustrates with five 'dances' with the steam boiler the changes of rural life in half a century. In the movie, filmed during the perestroika era, a sixth 'dance' has been added, showing the old age of the main characters on the background of the typical rural scenes of 1980s: industrial and technological developments combined with a reckless destruction of the environment.

A tamis (pronounced \\"tammy\\", also known as a drum sieve, or chalni in Indian cooking) is a kitchen utensil, shaped somewhat like a snare drum, that acts as a strainer, grater, or food mill. A tamis has a cylindrical edge, made of metal or wood, that supports a disc of fine metal, nylon, or horsehair mesh. To use one, the cook places the tamis above a bowl and adds the ingredient to be strained in the center of the mesh. The food is then pushed through using a scraper or pestle. Tamises have been in use since the Middle Ages. Because the tamis' mesh is flat, downward pressure can be applied with little effort simply by scraping with a horizontal motion. A tamis should be used with the inner hoop , first because it holds more, and second so that the bowl below will rest on the hoop rather than the mesh. Tamises sift and grate ingredients finer than any other utensil, and the texture of the strained material is evenly consistent. Tamises range in size from and the mesh is available in different gauges. The nylon mesh is more resilient than wire and keeps its shape better. It is the best (preferably medium-coarse) mesh to use for fruit pur√©es, which are liable to become discolored and tainted by wire.

Frank returned as a permanent character during the episode broadcast 1 December 1987 and remained in the show for six years, being killed off in the episode aired on 5 November 1993. Development Frank, a lorry driver, had been promised a desk-job but failed to gain the promotion.Kibble-White 2002, p.55. The breakdown of their marriage deeply effects their youngest daughter Katie Rogers (Diane Burke). Burke told the Liverpool Echo's Peter Grant that \\"as the youngest daughter of Frank and Chrissy Rogers, [Katie] had a lot on her plate.\\" Frank later enters a relationship with Lyn McLoughlin (Sharon Power). He has to fight off unwanted advances from Lyn's sister Bev McLoughlin (Sarah White). Frank's departure storyline saw him killed in a car crash caused by a \\"drug-crazed\\" Jimmy Corkhill (Dean Sullivan). The accident happens as Frank tries to make it to his wedding reception to Lyn McLoughlin (Sharon Power). Frank dies just after reaching hospital, and his other passenger Tony Dixon (Mark Lennock) is in a coma for three months before dying in hospital. Storylines Frank, originally a guest character, came to Brookside Close in November 1982 as a friend of Gavin (Danny Webb) and Petra Taylor (Alexandra Pigg), and helped them move into Number 10. Following Gavin's death from a brain aneurysm, Frank and Barry Grant (Paul Usher) helped Petra cope with Gavin's death. After Petra's suicide in 1983 Frank was written out of the soap and left on the after Petra's funeral. Four years later, Frank returns as a permanent character with his wife Chrissy (Eithne Brown) and children, renting No.7 from Harry Cross (Bill Dean). Frank is promised a desk job at his lorry firm but they do not offer him the position. He travels to London to sort the problem out, but his lorry is stolen and he faces disciplinary action. Frank decides to upscale and buys the more spacious No.5 in 1989, following its repossession from Sheila Grant (Sue Johnston). Frank later attends a funeral where he meets Lyn McLoughlin (Sharon Power). The pair form a close bond and begin a relationship, following the end of his marriage to Chrissy in 1991.

Jimmy Corkhill (Dean Sullivan) is also driving, but while under the influence of cocaine. He causes Frank to swerve off the road and crash into a wall. Lyn, who was sitting in the back of the Rolls Royce car, escapes uninjured, but Frank and Tony took the brunt of the impact. Frank dies shortly after reaching the hospital, and Tony is left in a coma. After Frank's funeral, it is revealed that the post-mortem showed him to be above the drink-drive limit.

He headed the London School of Jewish Studies from 1971 to 1982, and the hesder yeshiva Birkat Moshe in Ma'ale Adumim from 1982 until his death. Early life and education Nahum Rabinovitch was born in Montreal, Quebec to Sarah (n√©e Weiner) and Sam Rabinovitch. After completing an eight-year course of studies under Rabbi Pinchas Hirschsprung, Rabinovitch received semicha from Montreal's Yeshivas Merkaz HaTorah in the city's first rabbinical ordination ceremony. After obtaining an honours degree in commerce from Sir George Williams College, he left for Baltimore to pursue a Master of Science degree in mathematics at Johns Hopkins University. While there, he studied at Yeshivas Ner Yisroel, where he received a second ordination from Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman. Career Between 1955 and 1963, Rabinovitch served as spiritual leader of the Brith Sholom Beth Israel Congregation in Charleston, South Carolina. In this role, he helped establish the city's first Jewish day school, of which he served as principal. He also held appointments as lecturer in mathematics at the College of Charleston and chaplain to the Sixth Naval District Headquarters. In 1963, he was called to serve as a community rabbi in Toronto, and assumed the pulpit of the Clanton Park Synagogue in Downsview. He completed a Ph.D. in the philosophy and history of mathematics at the University of Toronto in 1971 under the supervision of Kenneth O. May. His doctoral thesis, Probability and Statistical Inference in Ancient and Medieval Jewish Literature, was published as a monograph in 1973. Rabinovitch was appointed principal of Jews' College in early 1970, and settled in London that spring. Notable among his students at the College was Chief Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, who has cited Rabinovitch as his primary role model. Ten years later, he accepted an offer to become rosh yeshiva of Yeshivat Birkat Moshe, a hesder institution in Ma'ale Adumim. In 2015, together with a group of prominent Israeli rabbis, Rabinovitch established Giyur Kehalacha, an independent beit din offering conversions outside of the Chief Rabbinate. Philosophical and political views Rabinovitch published Halakhic rulings on various subjects, including organ donation, surrogacy, birth control, army service, Shabbat, and kashrut. His philosophical approach, influenced by Maimonidean rationalism, emphasized the connection between philosophy and Halakha, between Torah and scientific studies, and between theoretical learning and practical applications. Rabinovitch was an authority on the writings of Maimonides, about which he published numerous books and essays. He is perhaps best known for his fourteen-volume Yad Peshuta ( 'Outstretched Hand'), an in-depth commentary on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah. He also authored Melumdei Mil·∏•amah ( 'Learned in War'), a collection of responsa dealing with Halakhic issues facing religious members of the Israel Defense Forces. Rabinovitch was a religious Zionist, a supporter of the settlement movement, and a vocal opponent of the Oslo Accords. He was, however, often more liberal in social and religious matters than many in the religious Zionist movement. In an interview, Rabinovitch said that he backed religious studies for women, and did not see a problem in Halakhic decisions taken by women. Nonetheless, he signed a letter in 2019 agreeing with the Chief Rabbinate's opposition to religious Jewish women serving in the IDF. He also ruled that it is incumbent on Israeli combat medics and doctors to treat and save the lives of Palestinian combatants, even if wounded in the course of attacking Israelis. Rabinovitch characterized Christianity and Islam positively as movements that spread monotheism, morality, and messianic hope. In 1995, Rabinovitch was among a group of rabbis accused of indirectly influencing Yigal Amir to assassinate Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, having branded Rabin a moser and likened his government to Nazis. The previous summer, he had also issued a ruling that Jewish soldiers should disobey any government orders to vacate West Bank army bases.  Personal life  Rabinovitch had six children, including British journalist Dina Rabinovitch (born in 1963), who died in 2007 of breast cancer.

It is, however, a rich and ancient poetic tradition that lasted for nearly 700 years, and one whose influence can still be felt in the modern Turkish poetic tradition. Even in modern Turkey, however, Ottoman Divan poetry is a highly specialist subject. Much of this has to do with the fact that Divan poetry is written in Ottoman Turkish, which was written using a variant of the Arabic script and made extensive use of Arabic and Persian words, making the language vastly different from modern Turkish. In its own time, knowledge of this form of literary Turkish was largely limited to the educated classes. History The Ottoman Divan poetry tradition embraced the influence of the Persian and, to a lesser extent, Arabic literatures. As far back as the pre-Ottoman Seljuk period in the late 11th to early 14th centuries CE, this influence was already being felt: the Seljuks conducted their official business in the Persian language, rather than in Turkish, and the poetry of the Seljuk court was highly inflected with Persian. When the Ottoman Empire arose in northwestern Anatolia, it continued this tradition. The most common poetic forms of the Ottoman court, for instance, were derived either directly from the Persian literary tradition (the gazel; the mesnev√Æ), or indirectly through Persian from the Arabic (the kas√Æde). However, the decision to adopt these poetic forms wholesale led to two important further consequences:Tanpƒ±nar, 2‚Äì3 * the poetic meters (Persian: beher (Arabic: ÿ®Ÿéÿ≠Ÿíÿ±); Turkish: aruz (Arabic: ÿπŸéÿ±ŸèŸàÿ∂)) of Arabic poetry were adopted. * Persian- and Arabic-based words were brought into the Turkish language in great numbers, as Turkish words rarely worked well within the system of the Arabic poetic meter. Out of this confluence of choices, the Ottoman Turkish language‚Äîwhich was always highly distinct from standard Turkish‚Äîwas effectively born. This style of writing under Persian and Arabic influence came to be known as \\"Divan literature\\" (Turkish div√¢n edebiyatƒ±), as div√¢n was the Ottoman Turkish word referring to the collected works of a poet. Beginning with the Tanzimat reform period (1839‚Äì1876) of Ottoman history and continuing until the dissolution of the empire in the early 20th century, the Divan poetic tradition steadily dwindled, and more and more influence from both Turkish folk literature and European literature began to make itself felt. Divan Mesnevi Mesnevi (masnavi or mathnavi) in literary term \\"Rhyming Couplets of Profound Spiritual Meaning\\" is style developed in Persian poetry which Nizami Ganjavi and Jami are the famous poets of type. In Turkic literature first mesnevi was Yusuf Has Hajib's Kutadgu Bilig. Generally social concepts Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, Fuz√ªl√Æ's Leyla ile Mecnun'u, military events, educational concepts such as Yusuf Nabi's Hayriye or related to religion or philosophy such as Mevlana's (Rumi) Masnavi is covered. A peculiarity of the masnavi of the Ottoman period is that they almost always possess, beneath the literal meaning, a subtle spiritual signification. Many poems, of Mesnevi of Mevlana and the Divan of A≈üƒ±k Pa≈üha examples of confessedly religious, moral, or mystic but a much larger number are allegorical. To this latter class belong almost all the long romantic mesnevis of the Persian and mid Ottoman poets; in the stories of the loves of Leyla and Mecnun, Yusuf and Zuleykha, Kusrev and Shavin, Suleyman and Ebsal, and a hundred of like kind, can see pictured, if we look beneath the surface, the soul of man for God, or the yearning of the human heart after heavenly light and wisdom. There is not a character introduced into those romances but represents the passion not an incident but has some spiritual meaning. In the history of Iskender, or Alexander, we watch the noble human soul in its struggles against the powers of this world, and, when aided by God and guided by the heavenly wisdom of righteous teachers, its ultimate victory over every earthly passion, and its attainment of that point of divine serenity whence it can look calmly down on all sublunary things.

They are fine- grained and plastic in nature, and, unlike most earthenware clays, produce a fine quality white-coloured pottery body when fired, which is the key to their popularity with potters.

They are mined in parts of the Eastern United States and from three sitesThe Bovey Basin in South Devon, the Petrockstowe Basin in North Devon and the Wareham Basin in South Dorset. in Devon and Dorset in South West England. They are commonly used in the construction of many ceramic articles, where their primary role, apart from their white colour, is either to impart plasticity or to aid rheological stability during the shaping processes. History The name \\"ball clay\\" is believed to derive from the time when the clay was mined by hand. It was cut into 15 to 17-kilogram cubes and during transport the corners of the cubes became rounded off leaving \\"balls\\". The ceramic use of ball clays in Britain dates back to at least the Roman era. More recent trade began when a clay was needed to construct tobacco pipes in the 16th and 17th century.

He is best known for the invention of an easy-to-use cuff-based version of the mercury sphygmomanometer for the measurement of blood pressure.  Biography  Riva Rocci was born on 7 August in Almese in 1863. He graduated in medicine and surgery in 1888 from the University of Turin. From 1888 to 1898 he acted as assistant lecturer at the propaedeutic medical clinic in Turin under the guidance of Carlo Forlanini and assisted him in the application of \\"iatrogenic pneumothorax\\" for treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. In 1894 he graduated in pathology and in 1907 in pediatrics. In 1898, he followed Forlanini to the University of Pavia where he continued to contribute to the development of Forlanini's method by showing that the technique did not have a major adverse effect on lung function. From 1900 until 1928 was chief clinician and director of the civic hospital in Varese, and helped to modernize the hospital by opening sanatorium wings and introducing vaccination, radiology and other methods to fight tuberculosis. From 1909 to 1916, he occupied the first chair of pediatrics at Pavia University. Illustration of Riva-Rocci's spygmomanometer in use In 1928 he retired from his medical positions due to a neurological condition, probably encephalitis lethargica, which he may have contracted from a patient or an autopsy during an epidemic in 1921. He spent the last years of his life in ill-health with paralysis agitans, and died on 15 March 1937 in Rapallo. He was buried in the small cemetery of San Michele di Pagana. The tomb of Riva- Rocci  Invention of a sphygmomanometer  Riva Rocci's major contribution to medicine was the invention of an easy-to-use version of the mercury sphygmomanometer which measured brachial blood pressure. The key element of this design was the use of a cuff that encircled the arm - previous designs had used rubber bulbs filled with water or air to manually compress the artery or other technically difficult methods to measure pressure. In 1896, Riva Rocci published his work describing the new sphygmomanometer in the Gazzetta Medica di Torino. In total he published four papers on the design and usage of the device between 1896 and 1897. His design included every-day objects such as an inkwell, some copper pipe, bicycle inner tubing and a quantity of mercury. Riva Rocci measured the peak (systolic) blood pressure by observing the cuff pressure at which the radial pulse was no longer palpable. This approach did not allow the measurement of diastolic blood pressure, although it was possible to estimate mean arterial pressure with the device, albeit with some difficulty. The American neurosurgeon, Harvey Cushing (1869-1939) visited Riva Rocci at Pavia in 1901 and made drawings and was given an example of his device. On his return to the US he made a similar device with some improvements and used it successfully in Johns Hopkins Hospital, most notably in intracranial surgery. Cushing, with support from Theodore Janeway in New York City and George Crile in Cleveland, played a major role in popularizing Riva Rocci's mercury sphygmomanometer. Subsequent improvements to the device included the use of a wider cuff (the original was only 5 cm wide) and the use of Korotkoff sounds to determine systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Riva Rocci always refused to patent his invention and did not make any financial gains from its widespread use.

He also headed the consolidated Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources from January to May 2007. Biography and background Mallam Adamu Bello was born on 20 May 1951 in Numan, Adamawa State. Born to Justice Mohammed Bello, he had a comfortable childhood with a complete education. Justice Bello died in 1956 leaving young Adamu to be taken care of by his oldest brother, Justice Aminu Bello. Mallam Adamu Bello is married to a pharmacist, Mrs Lubabatu Bello and has six children.

Banking career An accomplished banker, Mallam Bello started his career in 1976 as an Investment Executive with the New Nigerian Development Company (NNDC). Between 1976 and 1981, he rose to become the General Manager of New- Devco Finance, a subsidiary of NNDC. In 1983, Mallam Bello joined Habib Bank as Deputy Managing Director and rose to become Managing Director and Chief Executive in 1988. He held the position until 1994. During his time at Habib Bank, the bank rose to become the best rated private bank in the country and ninth overall. He then proceeded to become a financial adviser, a real estate mogul and major shareholder in numerous ventures until his nomination as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Intercity Bank Plc in 1998. This was then followed by his appointment as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Habib Nigeria Bank Ltd in 1999. Having been the first indigenous Chief Executive Officer of the company, he knew the direction of the bank and served to his full capacity. It was from this position that he received his nomination as the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo in January 2001. Having reached the pinnacle of his banking career, he accepted the national assignment. Habib Bank merged with Platinum Bank in December 2005 to form Bank PHB.

Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Mallam Adamu Bello became the honourable Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development in February 2001. During Mallam Bello‚Äôs tenure, the Ministry become a true force in regulating and ensuring the attractiveness of the Nigerian agricultural sector. There has also been the invitation of numerous agricultural experts to improve the operation of the sector in general. The general positive direction of the agricultural sector reinforced President Obasanjo‚Äôs renomination of Mallam Bello to retain his position after being re-elected in May 2003. With the support of the president, also a farmer, Mallam Bello has been able to accomplish many initiatives to better the conditions of the Nigerian farmer. They include cassava, cocoa and many others. The growth rate of the agriculture sector has moved from 4% in 2001 to 14% in 2006. In the area of rural development, the ministry has been able to improve conditions of rural areas, where most of the agriculture occurs. This is through improving their road network to urban markets and also through the provision of water facilities to aid the irrigation of farmlands. This was done independently or sometimes, in conjunction with the Ministry of Water Resources and also with the United Nations. His effectiveness in his portfolio has made him the longest-serving Minister of Agriculture in Nigeria ever. It has also seen him become the longest-serving member of the Federal Cabinet along with Chief Babalola Borishade and Prof. Turner Isoun. The Water Resources Portfolio In January 2007, the number of ministries was decreased to 19 from the previous number of 34. The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development AND the Ministry of Water Resources were merged to become the largest project ministry. Mallam Adamu Bello now became the substantive minister of Agriculture and Water Resources with two Ministers of State. Controversy Barely four months after his assumption of office when he decided along with the Federal Cabinet that Nigeria must import a few million tons of Beans from the country of Burkina Faso. The reasons were well founded but were harshly taken by the media who called for his resignation. Another controversy was faced when the former Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Senator Bode Olowoporoku alleged that the minister connived with foreigners to dupe the country in a 3.4 Billion Naira scandal over fertilizer imports. A bag of fertilizer was said to cost N1500 in Ukraine, the main import country and was said to be sold by the ministry for N2800 with a margin on each taken by the minister. He explained to the Federal Cabinet the reasons for the disparity to include transport and duties cost of the process of moving fertilizer from the Ukraine to Nigeria. They accepted his explanation with his presentation of documentation to that effect. The case was dismissed by both the EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission) and ICPC (Independent Corrupt Practices Commission). Senator Olowoporoku still continued with his proceedings against the minister even walking out the Minister of State of Agriculture, Chief Bamidele Dada from the Senate chambers when he came to explain. Mallam Bello expressed that Olowoporoku must have a vendetta against him over not being awarded fertilizer contracts during the process that may have earned him N200 million. The senator denied this saying ‚ÄúI have never requested contracts from the Ministry in my position as a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria‚Äù. Evidence was presented of his two letter-headed requests with his signature. He dismissed the evidence as his attempt of helping some of associates of his. The Corporate Affairs Commission however disclosed that he registered both companies and his wife was listed as the CEO and Managing Director. This exposed the vendetta. The Senate relieved Chief Olowoporoku of his position as the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture. He was also excluded from membership in all committees. This was subsequent to his eventual dismissal from the ruling political party, the Peoples Democratic Party. The media capitalized on making an opera of the situation. Details of the alleged scandal. Titles and conferment Mallam Adamu Bello was conferred with the chieftaincy title of the ‚ÄúDan Iyan Adamawa‚Äù in 1989 by the chieftaincy council of his native Gongola State (Adamawa and Taraba States) at the time. In 2003, he also received another chieftaincy title; ‚ÄúOtun Babalakin‚Äù in Ekiti State. Mallam Adamu Bello was made a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (FCIB) in 1991. He was also conferred with an Honorary Doctorate (Honoris Causa) by the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (Lautech) of Oyo State.

Retrieved on October 22, 2015. \\"The School Office St. Catherine's British School Leoforos Venizelou 77 141 23 , Lykovrissi Athens, Greece\\" Founded in 1956, the school now teaches over 1100 children and young adults from all over the world and is staffed by more than 120 teachers and associated personnel. St Catherine's follows the National Curriculum used in the United Kingdom, and lessons are taught primarily in the English language. History Originally, St Catherine's was a small primary school held at the British Ambassador's house. It catered mainly to the children of British citizens and employees of the British Embassy. In the 1960s, the school moved to a large complex of buildings in Lykovrisi, which is located in northern Athens near the suburb of Kifissia. In 2000, it developed an Upper School and expanded its grounds to include more buildings and sports facilities. Over the past 10 years, the school has expanded considerably and now has more than 1000 pupils from 54 different nationalities, including many native Greeks. Administration St Catherine's is a not-for-profit organisation registered in the United Kingdom. As a charity, the school does not have any owners and is instead administered by the Governing Body, and as Charity Trustees has control of the School and its property and funds. The Governing body is required by company law and charity law to act in the best interests of the School and to further the objects at all times and to act in accordance with the law.

The school allows its students to elect class representatives to the Lower School Council, Key Stage 3 Council and the Senior Senate which meet with senior staff to discuss issues raised by students and also to organise fund-raising and other community initiatives. Education In addition to teaching the National Curriculum for England and Wales, the school also offers courses leading to IGCSE and the diploma of the International Baccalaureate. At the ages of 7, 11 and 14 pupils undertake externally set and marked tests (obtaining papers and marking services through DCSF/ISN no: 1250043). The annual test results are published to parents and the international community in the prescribed manner. The school‚Äôs test results greatly out-perform national test averages for schools in England and Wales. Similarly, IGCSE results are in the upper range for independent schools in the UK. The average A*-C pass is 9 subjects per student This year the school‚Äôs sixth cohort of IB students will have graduated into university. In 2015 its students once again achieved a 99% diploma pass rate, with 94% of students entering their first choice university and 3% entering their second choice.

He was portrayed by Steven Fletcher from 2000 until the final episode of the series in 2003. Steve subsequently appeared in a video spin- off, Brookside: Unfinished Business. Storylines Introduction When Lindsey Corkhill (Claire Sweeney) sold No.9, the Murray family moved in. The Murrays were billed as an attempt to return the show to its original form of conventional families, rather than the waifs and strays it had become better known for. The Murrays were a hard-working, upright, working-class family, and comparisons could be drawn between them and the earlier Grant family, with Steve filling a similar role to that of Barry Grant (Paul Usher). Affair with Georgia In 2002, Steve begins an affair with a married woman, Georgia. When her husband finds out he posts a compromising video of them on the internet. This is a cause of great embarrassment for Steve when younger sister Adele (Katy Lamont) comes across the video.http://www.brooksidesoapbox.co.uk/ Vendetta with Jack Michaelson After Cinerco tried to buy up the houses, the residents were relieved when Max Farnham (Steven Pinder) sold his house to a private buyer rather than to Cinerco. This relief was short-lived when violent drug-dealer Jack Michaelson (Paul Duckworth) moved in. Michaelson's daughter Suzi (Simone Barry) became friends with Anthony, and the two started taking drugs she had stolen from her father. When Jack discovered cannabis in Suzi's room he stormed around to the Murray's and accused Anthony of being a bad influence on Suzi. When Jan (Helen Sheals) protested Anthony's innocence Jack hit her. Furious that Michaelson would hit his mother, Steve attacked Jack with planks of wood with the help of father Marty (Neil Caple) and uncle Christy (Glyn Pritchard). Jack, however, then attacked Christie with a pick- axe handle causing him such injury that he required a kidney removing. Marty later received a call from the hospital saying that Anthony and Suzi were found collapsed in the park after overdosing on drugs. Marty decides this is the last straw and something must be done about Michaelson. After a visit from Barry Grant stirs things up, the neighbours lynch Michaelson from his front window. The exact culprits weren't revealed however it is strongly implied that Marty and Steve were amongst them. Departure The Murray family left after Jan persuaded Marty to sell the house. Adele returned to Leeds, Marty, Anthony and Jan left for a new house while Steve went into business with Tim O'Leary (Philip Olivier) in Wales.

He was one of the main Stavka representatives during World War II who was responsible for five to seven Soviet fronts. Despite his fervent political engagement and loyalty to the Communist Party, Mekhlis was criticized and reprimanded for his incompetent military leadership during World War II by various Soviet leaders, including Joseph Stalin. Career Mekhlis, born in Odessa, completed six classes of Jewish commercial school. He worked as a schoolteacher from 1904 to 1911. In 1907‚Äì1910 he was a member of the Zionist workers' movement Poale Zion. In 1911 he joined the Imperial Russian Army, where he served in the second grenadier artillery brigade. In 1912 he obtained the rank of bombardier. He served in the artillery in the First World War of 1914-1918. In 1918 he joined the Communist Party and until 1920 he did political work in the Red Army (commissioner of brigade, then 46th division, group of forces). In 1921‚Äì1922 he managed administrative inspection in the People's Commissariat of Worker-Peasant Inspection (under People's Commissar (Narkom) Joseph Stalin). In 1922‚Äì1926 he served as the assistant to the secretary and the manager of the bureau of the Secretariat of the Central Committee - in effect Stalin's personal secretary. In 1926‚Äì1930 he took courses at the Communist Academy and in the Institute of Red Professors. From 1930 he was the head of the press corps Central Committee, and simultaneously a member of the editorial board, and then the editor in chief of the newspaper Pravda. In 1937‚Äì1940 he was the Commissar of Defense and the chief of the main political administration of the Red Army. From 1939 he was a member of the Central Committee of the CPSU (he had been a candidate since 1934), in 1938‚Äì1952 he was a member of the Orgburo of the Central Committee, in 1940‚Äì1941 People's Commissar of State Control (Goskontrolya). In June 1941 he was newly assigned by the chief of main political administration and the deputy of the Peoples Commissar of Defense. Nicknamed \\"the Shark\\" and the \\"Gloomy Demon\\", Mekhlis was named army commissar of the 1st rank, which corresponded to the title of General of the red Army. In 1942 he was the representative of the Stavka (headquarters) of supreme commander-in-chief at the Crimean Front, where he constantly disputed with General Dmitry Timofeyevich Kozlov. The leaders of the staff of the Front did not know whose orders to carry out ‚Äì the commander's or Mekhlis‚Äôs. The commander of the North-Caucasian Front, Marshal Semyon Budyonny, also could not control Mekhlis, who had no desire to be subordinated, only recognising orders which came directly from the Stavka. Mekhlis, during a stay at the post of the representative of Stavka, was occupied by the fact that he wrote sufficiently critical reports to senior officers. After one such report Major General Tolbukhin was taken off the post of chief of staff of the front, which had carelessness in contrast the instruction of Stalin to express opinion about the need for the front considering the need for being defended. So he attempted through the Stavka to replace the front commander, Kozlov, with Konstantin Rokossovsky or Klykov. At the same time in reports to Stalin he attempted to distance himself from the failures which the Crimean Front suffered, and to lay the entire responsibility on the front commander. In regard to this, Stalin sent a telegram to Mekhlis, in which he subjected to his rigid criticism for similar behavior: > Crimean front, t. Mekhlis: Your code message #254 (I) received. Your > position of a detached observer who is not accountable for the events at the > Crimean Front is puzzling. Your position may sound convenient, but it > positively stinks. At the Crimean Front, you are not an outside observer, > but the responsible representative of Stavka, who is accountable for every > success and failure that takes place at the Front, and who is required to > correct, right there and then, any mistake made by the commanding officers. > You, along with the commanding officers, will answer for failing to > reinforce the left flank of the Front. If, as you say, \\"everything seemed to > indicate that the opponent would begin an advance first thing in the > morning\\", and you still hadn't done everything needed to repel their attack > instead limiting your involvement merely to passive criticism, then you are > squarely to blame. It seems that you still have not figured out that we sent > you to the Crimean Front not as a government auditor but as a responsible > representative of Stavka. You demand that Kozlov be replaced, that even > Hindenburg would be an improvement. Yet you know full well that Soviet > reserves do not have anyone named Hindenburg. The situation in Crimea is not > difficult to grasp, and you should be able to take care of it on your own. > Had you committed your front line aviation and used it against the > opponent's tanks and infantry, the opponent would not have been able to > break through our defenses and their tanks would not have rolled through it. > You do not need to be a 'Hindenburg' to grasp such a simple thing after two > months at the Crimean Front. Stalin. ZK VKP(6)9.V.42r>>. After the crushing defeat in May 1942 on the Crimean Front (of 250,000 soldiers and officers on the Crimean Front in 12 days of fighting, 162,282 people, 65% were irrecoverable losses) he was removed from the post of the deputy people's commissar of defense and the chief of the main political administration of the Red Army. Witnesses claim that when Mekhlis came to Stalin shortly after the defeat, Stalin shouted at him and slammed a door in his face. He was demoted in rank two levels down to a corps commissar. In 1942‚Äì1946, he was a member of the military council of a number of armies and fronts. Mekhlis soon recovered from his demotion, as from December 6, 1942, he was a lieutenant general, and on July 29, 1944 he became a colonel general. On 23 June 1942 he was made head of the army‚Äôs Main Political Directorate, in this position his influence was contained by resistance from leading military officers like Zhukov and Voroshilov however. In 1946 he was made minister of government control of the USSR, a position he held until 1950. On October 27, 1950 he was discharged due to his health. He died in February 1953.

He was portrayed by Philip Olivier from 1996 until the final episode of the series in 2003.http://www.channel4.com/community/showcards/B/Brookside_-_Tim.html Tim subsequently appeared in a video spin-off, Brookside: Unfinished Business. Storylines Introduction \\"Tinhead\\" made his first appearance in Brookside as a school bully at Brookside Comprehensive in 1996. Danny Simpson (Andrew Butler) was Tinhead's main target, as he tried to bully him into helping him with his schoolwork. Tinhead was the leader of a gang of boys who continued to terrorise other pupils despite protests made to the head teacher by their parents. One day Danny gave Tinhead some schoolwork, knowing that he was going to take the credit for it, but Danny deliberately made the project complete nonsense so Tinhead was made to look a fool in front of his classmates. Tinhead decided to teach Danny a lesson, so after school he chased Danny and his mate Leo intending to give Danny a good beating, but when he escaped it was Leo who was left battered and bruised. Leo Johnson (Steven Cole) tried later to become part of Tinhead's gang by helping him steal a computer from the Simpsons' house on Brookside Close. Mick (Louis Emerick), Leo's father, tried to get Tinhead expelled from school for bullying, but came across an unexpected problem when he discovered that Tinhead's mother Carmel O'Leary (Carol Connor) was one of the school governors. Carmel refused to believe that her son was the ring leader of the gang of bullies. Tinhead, Sinbad and Carmel Sinbad (Michael Starke) later became involved in a relationship with Carmel and did his best to help her to try to get Tinhead to change his ways. Tinhead had other ideas, and took every opportunity to try and cause trouble between them. Jimmy Corkhill (Dean Sullivan) also had a run in with Tinhead when he discovered that he was responsible for bringing alcohol into the youth club . As tension in the O'Leary house continued to mount with Tinhead and Sinbad still at loggerheads, Tinhead left home having decided to squat in the flat above Mick Johnson's Pizza Parlor. While there, he thought he could make some easy money by selling the washing machine that was in the flat. Tinhead's plan backfired when he tried to remove the machine without turning off the water supply which resulted in him flooding the flat and causing extensive damage to Mick's shop below. Both Mick and Sinbad suspected that Tinhead was involved, but Carmel refused to believe he was the culprit. In an effort to make Tinhead a more responsible person Sinbad convinced David Crosbie (John Burgess) to give him a job at the petrol station, but it's not long before Tinhead, who resented being made to work, caused trouble when he put diesel in Ron Dixon (Vince Earl)'s petrol car. Change in ways Tinhead only started to see the error of his ways when he nearly killed his younger sister, Melanie (Elizabeth Lovelady). While playing with fireworks he caused a lorry to swerve, and crash into his house where Melanie was sitting watching television; luckily, she was not badly hurt. After this incident Tinhead had a change of attitude, and with encouragement from Sinbad, tried to join the Army. Tinhead passed the entrance interview and test with flying colours and really looked forward to life in the army, but was very disappointed when he arrived at the training camp only to be told that he could not join the Army after all because of a problem with his hearing. After this setback Tinhead refused to go out the for weeks feeling very dejected, until he found employment at a builders yard. It was not long before he was up to his old tricks, making money by selling building materials direct to customers and pocketing the cash. Feud with Sinbad The bad feeling between Tinhead and Sinbad got worse after Sinbad was found to be partly responsible for an explosion at Brookside Parade, which resulted in Tinhead's brother Ben (Simon Paul) being crippled for life. Despite Ben not blaming Sinbad for his injuries, Tinhead could not forgive him and started to seek revenge. After trying unsuccessfully to run him down in a stolen car, Tinhead eventually corners Sinbad near the edge of a lake with nowhere to run. Tinhead bore down on him in the car, but Sinbad jumps out the way just in time. Unable to stop, Tinhead ends up in the lake and the car sinks out of sight. Sinbad dives in the lake and pulls Tinhead clear of the car. Even after Sinbad had saved his life, Tinhead still refused to be friends until Ben finally managed to convince him that he should not blame Sinbad for what had happened to him. Staying with Sinbad When Sinbad offered to let him stay with him in Brookside Close, Tinhead agreed to put the past behind him and make a fresh start. To help him achieve this, Sinbad persuaded Mick Johnson to give Tinhead a job at his chip shop. At first Tinhead had few friends on Brookside close but later he and Leo Johnson became good friends, along with the Leo's cousin Jerome (Leon Lopez). Since the Shadwick family moved into No. 6, Tinhead had always shown an interest in daughter Emily (Jennifer Ellison), but it was some time before he had the courage to ask their out. Their first date did not go as planned as it coincided was his first day working at the New Millennium Club. Lindsey Corkhill (Claire Sweeney), his new boss, asked him to work late and he was unable to meet Emily at the arranged time. At first, Emily refused to accept his excuse, but with later encouragement from her friend Kelly she agrees to give Tinhead another chance. Vendetta against Susannah Since Sinbad had decided to look after him, Tinhead tried to stay out of trouble with the police. Emily after death of her brother Jason (Vincent Price) and father Greg (Mark Moraghan) had a change of character, and began to steal from her neighbours - particularly Susannah Morrisey (Karen Drury), who she blamed for her father's death. Tinhead was infatuated with Emily that he agreed to help her seek revenge on Susannah, first by entering her house while she was out and later stealing her car so that he and Emily could go to Blackpool. While in Blackpool, Emily persuaded Tinhead to help her steal from one of the other guests and later on the way back to set fire to Susannah's car. Tinhead continued to help Emily with her vendetta against Susannah, but when she turned her attention to other innocent people he began to have doubts about her real motives. Tinhead decided he could no longer be involved in her criminal activities after he agreed to help her break into a house only to see her start to wreck the place for no apparent reason. Tinhead told Emily they were finished, but later had a change of heart after Emily begged him to take her back and promised to change her ways. Tinhead and Emily thought they would never be caught for their crimes against Susannah, but their luck ran out after they returned from a camping holiday. While on holiday Emily had accidentally recorded on video a taped confession where she admitted carrying out various crimes during her vendetta against Susannah. It wasn't until they decided to watch the holiday video that they realised it contained their confession. They tried to stop anyone else seeing the tape but Mick picked it up and took it to Susannah's, thinking it was a comedy video. Susannah was horrified when she saw the video, which confirmed her suspicions that Emily had been behind the hate campaign. Although furious with Emily, Susannah decided not to involve the police and just tell her grandmother Jessie Hilton (Marji Campi) instead, as she thought Emily had suffered enough with the deaths of her father and brother. However, when she called round, Jessie she was out. Susannah instead told Nikki (Suzanne Collins) about the video but said she wouldn't be reporting it to the police. Nikki immediately called Emily home from college and told her about the tape. Emily panicked by the thought of Susannah seeing the tape sought reassurance from Tinhead. Tinhead and Emily returned to the bungalow but when they arrived a police car was parked outside of Susannah's house, and thinking that the police had been called they decided to run away, stealing Ray Hilton's (Kenneth Cope) car to make their escape. After they were well clear of Brookside, Tinhead tried to persuade Emily to return to the close letting him take the blame for her crimes, but Emily was determined they should go on the run together. Trouble with the law Tinhead managed to find a job working in a bar, but they had to leave after Tinhead fought with the owner who had attacked Emily. By this time they were running out of money so Emily decided they should call on Brian, a gay salesman they had met previously in Blackpool. Emily planned to blackmail Brian by threatening to tell his family that he was gay. Brian refused to hand over any money, so a vindictive Emily told Brian's family. Brian's wife was disgusted by this revelation and decided to leave him, taking their children with her. Tinhead thought Emily had gone too far this time and decided they should both return to Brookside and confess to the police. Emily agreed to do this, but just as Tinhead was confessing to stealing Susannah's car, Emily discovered that Susannah hadn't reported them after all. It was too late though, as the police then ask to see the video and as a result they were both charged. Tinhead and Emily were both released on bail with Tinhead staying at Mick's house and Emily with Jessie. As if this wasn't bad enough for Tinhead, he discovered that while he was away, his best friend Sinbad had left the close. Tinhead couldn't stand the thought of Emily going to prison, so he persuaded her to let him take all the blame when they appeared in front of the magistrate. Although Emily agreed to this she was distraught when Tinhead pleaded guilty to all the charges against him, although he was allowed home on bail pending his appearance in court. Tinhead became depressed while waiting for his trial as he and Emily were kept apart by Mick and Jessie. The night before he was due in court his mates took him for a night out at a club in an attempt to cheer him up. While at the club Tinhead saw Emily flirting Carl, a photographer, and in a jealous rage attacked him. Later, Tinhead stole Carl's car as an act of revenge and with Robbie Moffatt (Neil Davies), Clint Moffatt (Greg Pateras) and Mike Dixon (Paul Byatt) as passengers. He was soon racing round the streets at high speed. Mike was concerned for his safety and told Tinhead to slow down, but his plea was ignored until eventually their car crashed. Tinhead, Robbie and Clint escaped but Mike was badly hurt and ended up in hospital with serious back injuries. Time in prison When Tinhead appeared in court he pleaded guilty to all charges and was sent to prison. Later, Emily was sentenced to community service by a juvenile court. At first, Tinhead found it difficult to adjust to prison life and soon had a confrontation with another prisoner Sotto who tried to intimidate him. Tinhead soon made Sotto realise he couldn't be bullied and before long he had gained the respect of many of the prisoners. Craig, a prisoner who befriended Tinhead whilst in prison was beaten up badly by Sotto. Tinhead found him unconscious on the floor with serious injuries. Upset that his friend was badly injured, Tinhead decided to get revenge on Sotto; he broke into another prisoners cell, stealing drugs which he had kept stashed away and planted them in Sotto's cell. When the prisoner demanded to Tim to give him the drugs back, Tinhead discreetly told him that Sotto has them in his cell. He found the drugs in Sotto's cell and gave him a vicious beating. Tinhead smiled while hearing Sotto being attacked. Meanwhile, Emily wanted to earn extra money so that she and Tinhead could get married after his release. Carl took advantage of this and persuaded her to pose topless for some magazine photos. But Emily had second thoughts afterwards and after explaining everything to Nikki, Emily, with Nikki's help, called on Carl to demand the negatives. Although Emily thought she had all the photos, one still found its way into a girlie magazine, thanks to Carl. It was not long before a copy of this magazine arrived at Tinhead's prison, and the other prisoners took great delight in tormenting Tinhead about it. Emily explained that she posed for the photos in an attempt to earn extra money, and although Tinhead was initially furious with Emily, eventually he forgave her. Upon release, Tinhead made Carl refund the money Emily paid to pose for the photos. Marriage Soon after he was released Tinhead and Emily decided to get married, although the ceremony was held in secret to prevent Jessie trying to stop them. On the day of the wedding Emily only just made it to the registry office in time after being held up at the hair salon. While Tinhead wore a traditional suit, Emily opted for something a little different and got married wearing a white boob tube, mini skirt, white fur coat and a cowgirl Stetson. Jessie found out about the wedding but was too late to prevent them getting married. She argued with Tinhead outside the registry office, but he ignored her and drove away with Emily in a stretch Limo, to spend their first night in a hotel. The next day they returned to the close, but Jessie refused to allow Tinhead to stay with Emily in the bungalow. It seemed the newly weds would have nowhere to live until Mick agreed to let them stay at No 5 while he and Yvonne were away on holiday. Emily persuaded Tinhead to hold a party at the Johnson house while Mick was away, and although this seemed a good idea, things turned nasty after Sotto and Weller (two of Tinhead's ex-cell mates) turned up. Sotto tried to hit on Emily but she purposely poured her drink all over him. Tinhead, hearing the argument ordered Sotto to leave but Sotto decided to get his own back by inviting loads of his friends to No. 5 where they held their own party with music blasting out from the car stereo which upset a lot of the neighbors, especially Ron Dixon and Jimmy Corkhill. Jimmy stole the car and drove off out of the close to stop the music playing out loud. After the music had stopped, Sotto guessed that Tinhead had grassed him up. Whilst attacking Tinhead, Emily told Sotto that if he doesn't leave, Tinhead will have him beaten up again like he did in prison. In an act of revenge, Sotto and his mate smashed Mick's wide screen TV. Despite this Mick allowed Tinhead and Emily to continue living at No 5, until he decided to move away from the close after splitting up with Yvonne. Luckily, Jimmy Corkhill (Dean Sullivan) took pity on them and offered to let both Tinhead and Emily stay at his house. Tinhead almost ended up in prison again after supplying Ron Dixon (Vince Earl) with the gun used to shoot Clint Moffat, but Jimmy persuade Ron to tell police he got the gun from Sotto. Jimmy encouraged Tinhead to stay away from crime, but he found it impossible to get a good job with a prison record. Return to crime Tinhead approached Christy Murray (Glyn Pritchard), in the hope that he would offer him some work, but Christy just laughed at him. Furious at being made to look foolish, Tim wanted revenge, so after gaining information from Lance Powell (Mickey Poppins) about one of Christy's scams put his plan into action. He followed Christy to where he collected some stolen booze, and waited until Christy left the van unattended. Tinhead jumped in the van and drove off, but when he later tried to sell Christy back the booze at a profit, he was forced to give it back when Christy turned up with two mates. Undeterred, Tinhead persuaded Christy to let him take part in another heist on a lorry loaded with booze. Although they managed to steal the lorry, they were caught by the gang. Tinhead ended up in the Mersey while Marty was given a beating. Christy was forced to give the gang all the booze from Bev's Bar while Tinhead ended up in hospital after being washed up on the banks of the Mersey. Christy was terrified of the gang, so when Tinhead pressured him for the information about them, he ran off. Later he enlisted Steve Murray's (Steven Cartait) help and together they managed to steal a van full of booze from the gang without being seen. Although they had a few problems finding buyers, they eventually sold all the booze around different pubs in the area. Tinhead was elated by his success and eager for another heist. The end Towards the end of the series, Tinhead worked as a limousine driver. He remained friends with Jimmy throughout the series. After speaking to Barry Grant (Paul Usher), Tinhead was involved in the vigilante killing of drug dealer Jack Michaelson (Paul Duckworth).

History Clemente Michel, Carlo Re, Carlo Agnelli and Eligio Baudino started the company in 1847, as a vermouth bottling plant in Pessione. A few years later Alessandro Martini joined the team, becoming the director in 1863 along with Teofilo Sola and Luigi Rossi (who was the inventor of a vermouth). In 1863 they changed the company name to Martini, Sola & Cia. They started exporting bottles of vermouth around the world. New York city was given its first crates in 1867. At the time the firm was awarded several prizes, which are still recorded on the bottles: Dublin (1865), Paris (1867 and 1878), Vienna (1873) and Philadelphia (1876). Just thirty years after its creation, Martini was available in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Greece, Portugal, Belgium, Egypt and other countries. In 1879 the Sola family sold its interests to the remaining partners, who renamed the company Martini & Rossi, as it stands today. The brand may have given the American martini vermouth and gin cocktail its name (an early recipe for which is known from 1888), though other speculations on the cocktail's etymology exist.Martini at the online etymology dictionary In 1892 the business was taken over by Rossi's four sons; control passed to his grandsons in 1930.

It is 19 km away from Kozhikode city. Etymology The former name of Mavur was Pulpparambu, or \\"hayfields\\" in Malayalam, as grass for thatching houses was stored in this town. (In Malayalam, pul means \\"grass/hay\\", and parampu means \\"field\\".) Geography Mavoor is 19 km east of Kozhikode city, beside the river Chaliyar. Grasim factory Until the 1960s, Mavoor was like any other village in Kerala. During the 1963s the industrial house of Birla established a factory named \\"'Gwalior Rayons'\\" (later renamed as Grasim) at Mavoor for producing pulp and fibre on 316 acres of land. An integrated township with schools, a hospital, and a police station also came up. The arrival of Gwalior Rayons caused a rapid change in the area. In 1985 Grasim shut down for three years. The disruption caused to the local economy was significant. 11 suicides in Mavoor were attributed to this. In 1988, the Government of Kerala offered more concessions to the management and the factory was re-opened by the management. The factory faced many protests as it turned out to be a heavily polluting unit. The management avoided the use of any pollution control measures, citing profitability concerns. A large quantity of pollutants produced by Grasim ended up in the Chaliyar river which flows beside the factory. The thick effluents recklessly released by the factory were identified as poisonous. The factory was also a serious air polluter. The impact of the pollution could be seen in the every aspect of the town. Cases of asthma and other respiratory diseases shot up. There was a marked decline in the fish population. Thousands of dead fish and other aquatic animals surfaced from the Chaliyar river. Environmental organizations started agitations focusing on this aspect of the factory. E N Peethambaran master was a significant figure who worked for restoration of the environmental cleanliness, as well as ensuring justice to the workers of the factory. A series of labour strikes and heightened trade union was also witnessed at the plant. All these factors contributed to the shutdown of Gwalior Rayons in 2001. (See also the first environmental movement in Kerala.) The closure of the factory caused the loss of employment of around 3000 people. Future plans 386 acres of land is still owned by the Birla group of companies in Mavoor town. The government can utilize this land for the development of Mavoor town. However, the control of the land is still vested with the Birla management. The Kerala Government is planning to build another industrial hub in Mavoor which will be an eco-friendly project. This area is also considered ideal for the setting up of the AIIMS hospital, considering the availability of the required amount of land in the vicinity of an abundant freshwater source - the Chaliyar. Moreover, Mavoor, owing to the previous presence of a factory, is fully equipped to house big installations and organizations. Culture Many temples, mosques and churches are situated in the nearby places. Kalchira Sree Narasimha Moorthy Kshethram, Mavoor Juma masjid, Valiya Juma masjid, Kalpally Juma masjid, Christ the King Church, and Little Flower Church are the major religious centers in Mavoor. Arts and sports clubs drive the cultural aspirations of people. The Mavoor Public Library is on the ground floor of the Grama Panchayath Office. Climate The district has a generally humid climate with a hot season extending from March to May. The most important rainy season is during the south west monsoon, which sets in the first week of June and extends up to September. In June and July, most of the places suffer the threat of floods. Demographics India census, Mavoor had a population of 27,843. Males constitute 50% of the population and females 50%. Mavoor has an average literacy rate of 82%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 85%, and female literacy is 79%. In Mavoor, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age.

He was the son of Count Ralph IV of Valois and Ad√®le of Bar-sur-Aube and thus the brother of Adele of Valois. He is also known as Simon de Vexin and Saint Simon. Simon was brought up at the court of William of Normandy, and inherited his father's sizable lands in 1074. These lay between the royal domain of King Philip I of France and the lands of William of Normandy, by then King of England, and made Simon an important man. It is said that at this time William of Normandy proposed a marriage between Simon and his daughter Adela (1064x1066-1137). In the meantime, King Philip attempted to withhold part of Simon‚Äôs inheritance and a three-year-long war resulted. A marriage with Adela was within the prohibited degree of consanguinity and Simon went to Rome to meet with Pope Gregory VII, perhaps to arrange a dispensation. Whether this was his motive, the Pope arranged a truce between Simon and King Philip. Perhaps as part of the papal settlement, Simon married a daughter of the Count of Auvergne (chronologically, this would have been either William V or Robert II) about 1075. Shortly afterwards Simon and his wife both took religious vows and entered monasteries. His county of Valois passed to his sister's husband, Herbert IV, Count of Vermandois, Amiens to Philip, and the Vexin was partitioned between Philip and William, creating the modern division between the Vexin fran√ßais and the Vexin normand. Simon was not content with the relatively luxurious surrounds of the Abbey of Saint- Claude, and decided upon a life as a hermit in the forests of Burgundy on the upper reaches of the Doubs River. There he and a few colleagues constructed cabins and cleared land to farm. This priory remained dependent upon Sainte- Claude until the 12th century, then upon Saint-Oyen de Joux. The village of Mouthe later grew up around the priory. Simon undertook a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and then again to Rome where he died. He received the Last Rites from Gregory VII. Simon was later beatified and his relics are still kept at Mouthe where a statue in his honour was erected in 1934.  Sources  *Bury, J.

However, her first collection of poems did not appear until 1978. Her father opposed the Soviet forces in Estonia in the middle of the 20th century. The authorities, therefore, did not approve of her. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Mihkelson has published ten poetry anthologies. Her poetry lacks meter, rhythm and rhyme, but contains surprising inversions. It is known for its intensity, allegorical content and metaphysical topics. Mihkelson has also published four novels, a selection of critical essays (Kirjanduse seletusi, or Explanations of Literature) and a collection of short stories (Surma s√ºnnip√§ev, or The Birthday of Death). IN 2001 she published the novel Ahasveeruse uni. Mihkelson's works frequently include allusions to her childhood, spent in hiding, Estonian mythology, and Estonian history.

His picture book Waiting was named both a 2016 Caldecott Honor Book and a Geisel Honor Book. It was only the second time any author has won that combination of awards. Career Kevin Henkes (pronounced HANK-us) thought he would be an artist until his junior year of high school when one of his teachers encouraged him in his writing efforts. He discovered that children's books combined both his literary and artistic interests. Henkes writes and illustrates children's picture books, many of which feature mice as their main characters. He also writes middle-grade fiction. Henkes wrote his first book during his freshman year in college. The book's theme deals with how a child describes the pleasures of occasional solitude. This theme is common in many of Henkes' later books. Henkes, one of five children, says that many of his storylines are inspired by his family and the neighborhood where he grew up in Racine, Wisconsin. Henkes has written and illustrated around fifty critically acclaimed and award-winning picture books, early readers, and novels in his career thus far. Henkes' first book, All Alone, was published in 1981 by Greenwillow Books. More than 50 books followed, including Chrysanthemum and Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse. In 1994 Henkes was a runner-up for one of the premier American Library Association (ALA) children's book awards, the Caldecott Medal for Owen, one of his mouse books. In 2004, he was a runner-up for the Newbery Medal for Olive's Ocean. The next year he won the Caldecott Medal for Kitten's First Full Moon, recognizing that as the year's best children's picture book published in the U.S. All of his books to date have been published by Greenwillow Books. Henkes won the inaugural Phoenix Picture Book Award in 2013 for Owen. The Phoenix Awards from the Children's Literature Association recognize the best books that did not win major awards when they were first published twenty years earlier. In 2014, he received a Newbery Honor for his book, The Year of Billy Miller.And the Newbery, Caldecott award winners are..., Ashley Strickland, CNN, January 27, 2014 In 2020 Henkes was awarded the ALA's Children's Literature Legacy Award, celebrating his entire body of work.

Tax preparation may be done by the taxpayer with or without the help of tax preparation software and online services. Tax preparation may also be done by a licensed professional such as an attorney, certified public accountant or enrolled agent, or by an unlicensed tax preparation business. Because United States income tax laws are considered to be complicated, many taxpayers seek outside assistance with taxes (53.5% of individual tax returns in 2016 were filed by paid preparers). The remainder of this article describes tax preparation by someone other than the taxpayer. Some states have licensing requirements for anyone who prepares tax returns for a fee and some for fee- based preparation of state tax returns only. The Free File Alliance provides free tax preparation software for individuals with less than $58,000 of adjusted gross income for tax year 2010. People who make more than $58,000 can use Free File Fillable Forms, electronic versions of U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) paper forms. National registration Until 2011, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service did not have a requirement for national registration of paid tax return preparers in the United States. However, effective January 1, 2011, new rules required the registration of almost all paid federal tax return preparers. Many of the new rules, however, were soon struck down by a federal court. The new rules had required that some paid preparers pass a national tax law exam and undergo continuing education requirements. Persons who are certified public accountants (CPAs), attorneys or enrolled agents were required to register, but were not required to take the exam and were not subject to the continuing education requirements.\\"Proposed New Requirements for Tax Return Preparers,\\" Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, at For purposes of the registration requirement, the IRS had defined a \\"tax return preparer\\" as \\"an individual who, for compensation, prepares all or substantially all of a federal tax return or claim for refund.\\"Id. Beginning in mid-2011, tax return preparers (other than CPAs, attorneys, and enrolled agents and a few others) had generally been required to take and pass a competency test to become a registered tax return preparer. Tax return preparers who had a Practitioner Tax Identification Number (PTIN) before testing was to become available were to have until December 31, 2013, to pass the competency test. New tax return preparers would have been required to pass the competency test before they could obtain a PTIN. The IRS had indicated that the new rules would have applied to all kinds of federal tax returns, including income taxes and payroll taxes. A new continuing education requirement of 15 hours per year would have been imposed on tax return preparers (except for CPAs, attorneys, enrolled agents, and a few others). In 2013, however, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia struck down most of these rules in the Loving case, holding that the Internal Revenue Service had no authority to require competency exams for tax preparers. The Court did indicate its decision did not affect the PTIN requirement. This requirement remains in effect.https://www.irs.gov/Tax- Professionals/IRS-Test-Requirements-for-Becoming-a-Paid-Tax-Professional All tax return preparers, including those tax return preparers who are attorneys, certified public accountants, or enrolled agents, are still required to have a PTIN. This rule continues to be effective for preparation of any federal tax returns after December 31, 2010. Controversy  Federal  The cost of preparing and filing all business and personal tax returns is estimated to be $100 to $150 billion each year. According to a 2005 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the efficiency cost of the tax system‚Äîthe output that is lost over and above the tax itself‚Äîis between $240 billion and $600 billion per year. For tax return preparation, Americans spent roughly 20% of the amount collected in taxes (estimating the compliance costs and efficiency costs is difficult because neither the government nor taxpayers maintain regular accounts of these costs).Tax Policy: Summary of Estimates of the Costs of the Federal Tax System by the U.S. Government Accountability Office Tax preparation businesses have been plagued with controversies over Refund anticipation loans. Intuit, the developer of tax preparation software TurboTax, has lobbied to prevent the IRS from setting up a Web portal for electronic tax filing.NPR - IRS Urges E-Filing ‚Äî But by Vendors Only, Please This lobbying resulted in the introduction of the proposed Taxpayer First Act of 2019.  California  The ReadyReturn program in California, begun as a pilot in 2005 (revived in 2007 and later integrated into CalFile) sends taxpayers believed to need simple tax returns a proposed draft of a return. Taxpayers can accept or modify the draft or, if they prefer, they can ignore the draft and complete their tax return without the draft. The process is similar to receiving a credit card bill where the recipient can dispute charges they did not authorize. This system is used in countries that include Denmark, Sweden, and Spain. Intuit and the tax preparation service H&R; Block have disclosed lobbying Congress against setting up a similar system for federal U.S. tax returns. Intuit spent about $3 million on lobbying in California from 2005 to 2010, where it unsuccessfully opposed the ReadyReturn program.

Early life and career  Adams was born at Great Barton, near Bury St Edmunds, on 24 February 1824. He became interested in natural history as a child. He qualified as a surgeon in April 1847, and in August of the same year became an assistant surgeon at the Royal Hospital Haslar in Gosport, Hampshire, before securing a transfer to the Naval Hospital in Devonport three months later.  Arctic exploration   Ross expedition  In 1848, four months after his transfer to Devonport, he volunteered to join Sir James Clark Ross on his Arctic expedition to search for traces of Sir John Franklin's missing Northwest Passage expedition. Adams was aboard under Captain Edward Joseph Bird. They left in May 1848, but returned 18 months later without success.  Collinson expedition  In January 1850, Adams left on another expedition to look for Franklin. This time he was aboard under Captain Richard Collinson. They reached the Bering Strait in August, and Adams was put ashore at St. Michael, just north of the Yukon delta, to investigate reports of possible survivors from Franklin's crew. He rejoined the Enterprise in July 1851, sailing east below Banks Island and Victoria Island, and penetrating further east than any ship previously. They returned to England in 1855.

He has been involved in over 300 full-length motion pictures and he is most known for his association with The Cannon Group, Inc., an American film production company, which he co-owned with his cousin Menahem Golan. Early life Globus was born in Tiberias, on the lake of Galilee, Israel in 1943 to Jewish parents who immigrated from Poland. At the age of 3 he moved with his family to the northern city of Kiryat Motzkin. His father, Shmuel, built a cinema which was unique at that time. When the cinema opened Globus was 5 years old and very interested in all aspects of the cinema. He would help with whatever his father needed from hanging posters, being a cashier, to promoting movies and at the age of 10 Yoram becoming the projectionist. During high school he moved to Tel Aviv where his parents opened another cinema. Globus graduated business school. He then enlisted to the Israel Defense Forces, served as a combat soldier and officer, and retired as a lieutenant. His cousin is Israeli filmmaker Menahem Golan. Career In 1963, he partnered up with Menahem Golan, who was already a well-known stage and film director in Israel. Together, they were instrumental in creating the film industry in Israel. Over the years they were very successful, building a company which had experience in producing movies in Israel, co-productions in Europe, which became the number 1 producing entity in Israel. They distributed European movies, Israeli movies and for over 25 years represented Warner Bros., Universal, Paramount and DreamWorks in Israel. Their most successful projects including; Operation Thunderbolt (The Anthebe story which was nominated for Academy Award), Kazablan (Musical which was sold to MGM), ‚ÄúLemon Popsicle‚Äù, ‚ÄúI Love You Rosa‚Äù, and ‚Äú The House on Chelouche Street‚Äù which was nominated for Best Foreign Film from The Academy Awards. With additional films which represented Israel in many festivals such as: Cannes Film Festival, Berlin Film Festival, AFM, Milano Film Market and more. In the early 1970s, Yoram and Menahem started to make movies in Europe (‚ÄúMagician of Lublin‚Äù based on the book by Isaac Bashevis Singer) and in Hollywood (‚ÄúLepke‚Äù with Tony Curtis which was sold to Warner Bros. and ‚ÄúThe 4 Deuces‚Äù with Jack Palance and Carol Lynley which was sold to Avco-Embassy). In 1978, Globus and Golan moved to Hollywood and acquired The Cannon Group, Inc. for $500,000, which was traded on NASDQ for 25 cents a share. They went to the Cannes Film Festival that year and licensed Cannon's movies for approximately $2.5M. After acquiring 51% of the company's shares they used the money to start making low budget action movies. In the beginning of the 1980s, Yoram and Menahem recognized that Video was the next big thing and signed Chuck Norris for a 7 years exclusive deal, Charles Bronson for a multiple picture deal, discovered Jean-Claude Van Damme and signed him for many pictures. They started the ninja trend, discovered Michael Dudikoff , and signed him to a multiple picture deal. Some of the pictures resulting from these deals include: The ‚ÄúMissing in Action‚Äù series (Chuck Norris), The ‚ÄúDeath Wish‚Äù series (Charles Bronson), ‚ÄùBlood Sport‚Äù (Jean-Claude Van Damme), ‚ÄúAmerican Ninja‚Äù (Michael Dudikoff). The company elevated the production slate and apart of the action movies they started to produce in 1982 movies such as: ‚ÄúSahara‚Äù (Brooke Shields), The Championship Season (Bruce Dern and Martin Sheen), ‚ÄúWicked Lady‚Äù (Faye Dunaway), ‚ÄúKing Solomon‚Äôs Mine‚Äù (Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone). Over those years, the Cannon Group stock was moved to the NY stock exchange and climbed up from 25 cents in the late 1970s to $48 in 1984. Cannon became the largest independent producer and distributor in the world. By the mid-1980s, Cannon was producing an average of 40 films per year and had become the largest independent movie production company in the world with a net worth of over US$1 billion. Because of their fast, low-budget style of filmmaking, they earned the nickname \\"the Go-Go Boys.\\" Among the films produced by Cannon are Bloodsport with Jean-Claude Van Damme, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace with Christopher Reeve, King Lear directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Runaway Train (1985), Over The Top with Sylvester Stallone and Street Smart with Morgan Freeman. During this time, Globus and Golan also acquired the rights to Spider-Man and Captain America. With Cannon's success, Yoram expanded the group's operations into additional territories. Cannon acquired approximately 1,600 cinemas across Europe and the United States (some of which were later purchased by Silvio Berlusconi), also studios, an extensive film library and additional acquisitions, which widened the activities of Cannon and established the company as a leading conglomerate in the global film industry. During these years, Cannon would finance their movies utilizing a new approach, a strategy created and originated by Globus, which is now known as \\"the pre-sale strategy\\". Substantial pre-sales of unproduced films were made based on the strong salesmanship skills of Globus and the promotional advertising created by Design Projects. The financial deposits collected from these pre-sales were used to finance the production of the first film in a Cannon line-up, which when completed and delivered to worldwide theater owners, would generate enough capital to then make the next film. For this purposes, Cannon would often generate mock movie posters before they even had a script and would display large billboards at sales events such as the Cannes Film Festival. During 1984, Cannon purchased Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment (see EMI Films) and their movie library for ¬£175 million. Cannon then sold the EMI British Film Library to Weintraub Entertainment Group for approximately $85 million. In 1989, \\"Path√© Communications,\\" a holding company controlled by Italian businessman Giancarlo Parretti, purchased 39.4% of Cannon for 250 million dollars. During that same year, Golan, citing differences with both Parretti and Globus, resigned from his position, leaving Cannon and Globus to launch his \\"21st Century Film Corporation.\\" In 1990, Globus and Parietti merged Path√© with the American film company \\"MGM\\" at which time Globus became MGM president. In 1993, having produced over 300 films, Globus returned to Israel to focus on his home company, \\"Globus Group,\\" which includes a private \\"Globus\\" arm with a large film and television studio in Neve Ilan, Israel (where various Israeli stations broadcast, such as the Israeli News Company). Globus is responsible for a significant part of the Israeli film distribution industry (\\"Noah CPP\\") and owns the public arm \\"Globus Max,\\" which owns and operates numerous theaters in Israel. In 1999, Yoram Globus won the Ophir Award for \\"Lifetime Achievement\\" by the Israeli Academy of Film and Television. During 2014, two documentary films were made about Golan/Globus and their \\"Cannon Films\\" story. Warner Bros released Electric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films, which was produced by RatPac-Dune Entertainment‚ÄîAnd that same year, the Israeli documentary The Go-Go Boys: The Inside Story of Cannon Films premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2015, Globus sold \\"Globus Max\\" and returned to Hollywood to launch a new film production company, \\"Rebel Way Entertainment.\\" The company seeks to reconnect young and web-crazy audiences with the traditional theatrical experience.

John Winslow belonged to one of the most prominent families of New England; his great-grandfather Edward and grandfather Josiah Winslow had both been governors of the Plymouth Colony. He was born in Marshfield, Massachusetts in 1703 as son of Sarah and Isaac Winslow. (During Father Rale's War, Winslows older brother Josiah was given the command of Fort St. George (Thomaston, Maine) and was killed by natives of the Wabanaki Confederacy in the Northeast Coast Campaign (1724). The following year, Winslow named his first born after his deceased brother.) In 1725, he married Mary Little, a descendant of Richard Warren. They had three children: Josiah, Pelham and Isaac Winslow. One of his slaves was Briton Hammon who published the Narrative of the Uncommon Suffering and Surprizing Deliverance of Briton Hammon, a Negro Man in 1760. After holding a few minor positions in Plymouth, he was commissioned captain of a provincial company in a failed British expedition to Cuba in 1740. Following this he transferred to the British Army and served as captain in the 40th Foot at Annapolis Royal in Nova Scotia, and St John's in Newfoundland. Seven Years War Narrative of Winslow's former slave Briton Hammon In 1754, he was promoted major-general of militia by Governor William Shirley of Massachusetts and put in command of a force of 800 men which was sent to the Kennebec River in Maine to consolidate British positions and prevent French encroachments. There he built two forts, Fort Halifax (Maine) and Fort Western. In 1755, he was appointed lieutenant- colonel of a provincial regiment raised by Shirley to aid Lieutenant Governor Charles Lawrence of Nova Scotia in his attempts to sweep French Acadian influence from the province, and played an important role at the capture of Fort Beaus√©jour in June 1755. During the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755), Winslow was then ordered to proceed to Grand-Pr√©, Nova Scotia, to remove the Acadian population, as part of the infamous Great Upheaval. Although often believed solely responsible for carrying out the deportation, Winslow was in charge of only one segment of a much larger operation. On 5 September 1755 he informed the assembled Acadian men that they and their families were to be removed from the province. Winslow termed the business \\"Very Disagreable to my natural make & Temper,\\" in his \\"Journal of Colonel John Winslow of the provincial troops, while engaged in removing the Acadian inhabitants from Grand Pre\\". The numerous delays in arranging transports caused the deportation to take far longer than had been anticipated, but by November he had shipped 1,510 Acadians to Pennsylvania, Maryland, and other British colonies to the south. He compiled a list of Acadian males deported that can be found at https://www.nosorigines.qc.ca/biography.aspx?at=h&id;=19&lng;=en Winslow returned to Massachusetts in November 1755, but only a couple of months later he was appointed by Shirley (then temporary commander-in-chief), to command the provincial troops in an expedition against Fort St. Fr√©d√©ric, New York. However, in March 1756 the new commander-in-chief, Lord Loudoun, arrived from Britain, and Winslow fought bitterly with him over his proposed integration of the provincial troops with the regulars. The provincial soldiers had enlisted to serve only under their own officers, and feared the hard discipline, with floggings and hangings, that was part of the regular army. And their officers feared that the integration could result in them losing their rank, as they held it only by colonial commission. The issue nearly developed into a mutiny of the provincial troops and a revolt of their officers, but Winslow eventually agreed to the integration under threats from Loudoun. In 1757 Winslow returned to Massachusetts and civilian life. He represented Marshfield in the General Court from 1757 to 1758 and from 1761 to 1765. In 1762 he served as a member of the St Croix River boundary commission, and in about 1766 he moved to Hingham, Massachusetts, where he died in 1774.

Thereafter, Viramdev established rule at Degana, Parbatsar and Ajmer respectively, but was dethroned again. Being highly demoralized, he took refuge at Amarsar, the Shekhawat capital and after a year persuaded Sur Emperor Sher Shah Suri to attack Jodhpur. When Sher Shah attacked Jodhpur in the Battle of Sammel. It is in this context, the Emperor said ‚Äì , meaning 'I would have lost the throne of Delhi for a fistful of Pearl Millet (the Barren Land of Marwar). One of the significant consequence of the war was regain of Merta throne by Rao Viramdev Mertia, whose son, Rao Jaimal succeeded him and in tune with the traditions of the brave clan added four moons to the glory of Merta. Rao Jaimal (1544‚Äì1568 AD) was also the commander of Mewar where his cousin sister Mira Bai was married into the Sisodia Royal Family. As against submissive Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner and various other Rajput Kingdoms, only Merta and Mewar refused to give daughters to Mughals. When Akbar attacked Mewar, with an army around 100,000 men, Rao Jaimal, the commander of Mewar, fought fiercely but was killed in battle. Merta was soon merged with Jodhpur State and 14 his sons were given small principalities nearby. The same spirit was shown by many descendants of the Mertia Royal Family, including the Chiefs of Rian, Methri and Alniyawas who fought against the rebels of Kumpawat clan in the battle of Merta in 1790 AD and suffered mass annihilation. One of the scion of the family who rose to prominence during the reign of Padshah Aurangzeb was Maharaja Raghunath Singh Mertia (1660‚Äì1683 AD), who conquered Maroth or Gaurawati and is ancestor of the rulers of Panch Mahal Maroth.

History In the early years after World War II, Fokker was resurrected with help from the national institute for aircraft development, the Nederlands Instituut voor Vliegtuigontwikkeling (NIV). Fokker expected strong demand for training aircraft, and therefore a range of designs was worked out. One of those became known as the S.13. This model, dubbed Universal Trainer, was meant to be trainer for multiple engine training, navigation training, paradropping training and training in radiotelephony. Fokker also envisaged a version for water operations, dubbed S.13W. This version had slightly different dimensions and less performance, mainly because of the floats that replaced the landing gear. Also a version for civil use was foreseen. The prototype with registration PH-NDWJane's all the world's aircraft 1953-1954, p.170 (changed to PH-NEI in 1954) made its maiden flight in 1949. The aircraft proved to be easy handling and strong. Flight testing was successful and the Dutch armed forces intended to buy the aircraft. Shortly before deciding upon procurement, the Dutch armed forces were provided with Beechcraft Model 18s under the Mutual Defense Assistance Pact (MDAP), almost for free. As other parties did not show interest in the S.13, Fokker terminated the programme. The only existing S.13 was transferred to the NIV in 1953. Years afterwards, the airframe was donated to the aerospace faculty of the TH Delft, today known as Delft University of Technology. Tactical history Although the Dutch armed forces never took the S.13 into service, Fokker operated the S.13 prototype in military livery. Therefore, the S.13 has flown as D-101. During the flood of February 1953, the D-101 was used for photoreconnaissance from naval air station Valkenburg. Remains There are some S.13 relics in existence today. The cockpit section is displayed in the Aeronautical & War Museum at Texel Airport. The tailsection is owned by Aviodrome aviation museum, but currently it is not on display.

Note, the Internet Movie Database and a number of other sources have mistakenly given his death as July 9, 1961.) was an American arranger, orchestrator and composer, who studied classical composition at the Paris Conservatoire. He is credited with orchestrating nine productions on Broadway from 1931 to 1938, and over seventy-five motion pictures from 1931 to 1962. Film scholar Clive Hirschhorn considers him the finest orchestrator ever to work in the movies.Clive Hirschhorn, Gene Kelly: A Biography, 1974, p.186 Early in his career, film composer John Williams spent much time around Salinger.Films & Filming, vol. 24, 1977, p.32 Hollywood career During his Broadway apprenticeship Salinger first came across Johnny Green, his future MGM musical director, when they were recording motion picture overtures in the early days of sound at New York to be shown before the main features began.Fred Karlin & Rayburn Wright, On the Track, Routledge, 2004, p. 655 Salinger first came out to Hollywood in the late 1930s to work for Alfred Newman (e.g. Born to Dance and Gunga Din) and also collaborated with the famed Broadway orchestrator Robert Russell Bennett on the arrangements for Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' 1938 dance picture Carefree. Salinger is recognized as MGM's best principal orchestrator of musicals made between 1942 and 1962. He reputedly studied mathematical musical progressions under the influential theorist Joseph Schillinger, whose other students included George Gershwin, and major Broadway/Hollywood orchestrators such as Ted Royal, Edward B. Powell, and Herbert W. Spencer.Marion Evans quoted in Steven Suskin, The Sound of Broadway Music, Oxford University Press, p. 80. Salinger employed a somewhat smaller orchestra than usual, but nevertheless achieved a rich, elaborately constructed sound in his arrangements. The fact that the orchestra that Salinger used was smaller in size than the normal huge studio orchestra was practically unnoticeable, except that the quality of the orchestral sound on films that Salinger worked on seemed greatly improved, with much less distortion than was common in the days before true high fidelity. However, in Hugh Fordin's The World of Entertainment: The Freed Unit at MGM, a 1975 book dealing with the MGM musicals, composer-conductor Adolph Deutsch, who worked with Salinger on more than one film, criticized his orchestrations for the Jerome Kern 1946 biopic Till the Clouds Roll By as being \\"too elaborate\\" for a composer like Kern (a criticism that Salinger reportedly did not take well) and recounted that he stated that he would only work with Salinger on the 1951 film version of Show Boat (music by Kern) if he \\"simplified\\" his style of orchestration. (The two did work on the film, receiving a joint Academy Award nomination for it.) Salinger orchestrated most of the musicals that MGM is famous for; among them, in addition to the 1951 Show Boat, were Girl Crazy (the 1943 version), Meet Me in St. Louis (1944) (which included a memorable arrangement of The Trolley Song), Anchors Aweigh (1945), the 1947 film version of Good News, Summer Holiday (1948), the 1949 film version of On the Town, the 1950 film version of Annie Get Your Gun, Singin' in the Rain (1952), the 1953 film version of Kiss Me, Kate, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), An American in Paris (1951), The Band Wagon (1953), Gene Kelly's pioneering 1956 all-ballet film Invitation to the Dance and the original film musical Gigi (1958). His lush scoring for the ballet sequences in Lerner and Loewe's Brigadoon (1954) have come to be regarded as high points of the orchestrator's art in the Golden Age of musicals.Will Friedwald, \\"Liner Notes\\", p. 9, Brigadoon: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, EMI Premier Soundtracks, CD, 1996 (TOCP-65123). Recognition Although many of the films that Salinger worked on were Oscar-nominated for the adaptation of the music featured in them, according to industry practices at the time, nominations usually went to the musical directors/conductors of the music (such as Adolph Deutsch or Andr√© Previn), and not to orchestrators. Only once was Salinger nominated, for his Show Boat orchestrations. Ironically, the film An American in Paris, which Salinger also orchestrated, was nominated for the same award that year, so the two films were competing against each other in the Oscar race. But in the case of An American, the nomination went only to Johnny Green, who conducted the George Gershwin music heard in the film, and not to Salinger. Green won that year; Salinger never received an Oscar. Despite this lack of popular recognition during his lifetime, Salinger was highly regarded within the film music industry; working steadily and occasionally uncredited (e.g. The Big Country for Jerome Moross). He was content to collaborate with some of the jazzier arrangers on the lot, most frequently Skip Martin and once memorably with Nelson Riddle for High Society (1956). Salinger orchestrated for film the music of all the major popular composers of the mid-20th century, including Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart and Cole Porter.Score credits compiled from Internet Movie Database and Internet Broadway Database His work on the 1948 biopic Words and Music, led Richard Rodgers to publicly applaud the way their songs were orchestrated and presented.John Reid, These Movies Won No Hollywood Awards, Lulu, 2005, p. 183 Barbra Streisand insisted on reusing his original orchestrations when they could be foundTim Smith, \\"Streisand returns to her roots,\\" 24 November 1985, News/Sun-Sentinel, Fort Lauderdale. and colleagues, including Stanley Donen, Johnny Green and Andr√© Previn, have subsequently paid tribute to his musical abilities. Salinger's contributions have gained wider public recognition since the 1970s with the release of the That's Entertainment! compilation films and many of the original soundtracks of his scores on compact discs.Principally the Premier Soundtracks series from Turner Classic Movies Music/EMI/Rhino Records. The British conductor John Wilson has also been repopularizing his work in a series of concerts featuring reconstructions of the original orchestrations of the MGM classics.Ivan Hewett, \\"John Wilson's plea for 'light music,'\\" 24 June 2009, The Telegraph, U.K. Final credits Salinger died suddenly in 1962, under disputed circumstances. The Internet Movie Database states that he had a heart attack in his sleep, but it is claimed that Salinger committed suicide.https://www.amazon.com/dp/1855100800 He lost his home in the 1961 Bel Air Fire, which police believe may have contributed to his despondency.Newport Daily News, 18 June 1962 The last film that he worked on was Billy Rose's Jumbo, released in 1962. It was not a big success, either critically or commercially. The film was based on a not too successful 1935 Rodgers and Hart stage musical, although the show did produce three hits, \\"My Romance,\\" \\"Little Girl Blue,\\" and \\"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.\\" Salinger also composed original music for film and television. Among the film scores he wrote was the one for Lonelyhearts, and among the TV scores he worked on were those for the series Wagon Train and Bachelor Father.

Prickle is part of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway that establishes planar cell polarity. A gain or loss of function of Prickle1 causes defects in the convergent extension movements of gastrulation. In epithelial cells, Prickle2 establishes and maintains cell apical/basal polarity. Prickle1 plays an important role in the development of the nervous system by regulating the movement of nerve cells. The first prickle protein was identified in Drosophila as a planar cell polarity protein. Vertebrate prickle-1 was first found as a rat protein that binds to a transcription factor, neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF). It was then recognized that other vertebrates including mice and humans have two genes that are related to Drosophila prickle. Mouse prickle-2 was found to be expressed in mature neurons of the brain along with mouse homologs of Drosophila planar polarity genes flamingo and dischevelled. Prickle interacts with flamingo to regulate sensory axon advance at the transition between the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. Also, Prickle1 interacts with RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) by transporting REST out of the nucleus. REST turns off several critical genes in neurons by binding to particular regions of DNA in the nucleus. Prickle is recruited to the cell surface membrane by strabismus, another planar cell polarity protein. In the developing Drosophila wing, prickle becomes concentrated at the proximal side of cells. Prickle can compete with the ankyrin-repeat protein Diego for a binding site on Dishevelled. In Drosophila, prickle is present inside cells in multiple forms due to alternative splicing of the prickle mRNA. The relative levels of the alternate forms may be regulated and involved in the normal control of planar cell polarity. Mutations in Prickle genes can cause epilepsy in humans by perturbing Prickle function. One mutation in Prickle1 gene can result in Prickle1-Related Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy- Ataxia Syndrome. This mutation disrupts the interaction between prickle-like 1 and REST, which results in the inability to suppress REST. Gene knockdown of Prickle1 by shRNA or dominant-negative constructs results in decreased axonal and dendritic extension in neurons in the hippocampus. Prickle1 gene knockdown in neonatal retina causes defects in axon terminals of photoreceptors and in inner and outer segments.

The movement originated with the call for a public debate regarding several issues within the Catholic Church by Martin Luther, then a professor of Bible at the young University of Wittenberg. Lutheranism soon became a wider religious and political movement within the Holy Roman Empire owing to support from key electors and the widespread adoption of the printing press. This movement soon spread throughout northern Europe and became the driving force behind the wider Protestant Reformation. Today, Lutheranism has spread from Europe to all six populated continents. Roots of Reformation (15th century) The 15th century saw many changes in European society, each of which can be attributed as a contributor to the academic and political climate that allowed for the spread of the Lutheran movement. Societal upheaval in Europe Luther's father, Hans, by Lucas Cranach the Elder At the beginning of the 16th century, the European continent had seen vast changes in the ordering of society and culture in the last 200 years. The dramatic loss of population due to the Black Death had created new economic opportunities and mobility among the lower classes of society. New technologies came about to address labor shortages and the need to increase productivity, which in turn created new classes of society to support manufacture and trade. Hans Luther, the father of Martin Luther, was a member of this new middle class. Hans Luther made a living leasing and operating copper mines and smelters. The Luther family enjoyed enough income and social status that it was possible for Hans to envision a university education and career as a lawyer for his son. The 14th century had also produced upheaval in the Roman Catholic Church with the resolution of the Western Schism in the early part of the century, the controversies surrounding the papacies of the Renaissance era and new pressures brought by the invasions of Christendom by the burgeoning Ottoman Empire. Spread of literacy The spread of books and higher education had an obvious impact on the Lutheran reformers. The Gutenberg Bible was first printed in 1455, with subsequent editions of the Bible and other books quickly becoming available in wider distribution than ever before. Along with the spread of the book, universities were becoming the centers of a new academic culture that existed outside of the immediate control of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1502, Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, founded the University of Wittenberg, a university that would house a young Augustinian monk as a \\"Professor of Bible\\" named Martin Luther. The start of the Reformation Cardinal Albrecht of Hohenzollern, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg, was using part of the indulgence income to pay bribery debts;Rupp, Ernst Gordon. \\"Martin Luther,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, accessed 2006. portrait by Albrecht D√ºrer, 1519 The sale of indulgences shown in A Question to a Mintmaker, woodcut by J√∂rg Breu the Elder of Augsburg, c. 1530 In 1516‚Äì17, Johann Tetzel, a Dominican friar and papal commissioner for indulgences, was sent to Germany by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money to rebuild St Peter's Basilica in Rome.\\"Johann Tetzel,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2007: \\"Tetzel's experiences as a preacher of indulgences, especially between 1503 and 1510, led to his appointment as general commissioner by Albrecht, archbishop of Mainz, who, deeply in debt to pay for a large accumulation of benefices, had to contribute a considerable sum toward the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Albrecht obtained permission from Pope Leo X to conduct the sale of a special plenary indulgence (i.e., remission of the temporal punishment of sin), half of the proceeds of which Albrecht was to claim to pay the fees of his benefices. In effect, Tetzel became a salesman whose product was to cause a scandal in Germany that evolved into the greatest crisis (the Reformation) in the history of the Western church.\\" On 31 October 1517, Luther wrote to Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg, protesting the sale of indulgences. He enclosed in his letter a copy of his \\"Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences,\\" which came to be known as the Ninety-five Theses. Hans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church, but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices, and the tone of the writing is accordingly \\"searching, rather than doctrinaire.\\"Hillerbrand, Hans J. \\"Martin Luther: Indulgences and salvation,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2007. Hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses, particularly in Thesis 86, which asks: \\"Why does the pope, whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus, build the basilica of St. Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money?\\" St. Nicholaus church in J√ºterbog (article in German).

Christians, he said, must not slacken in following Christ on account of such false assurances. According to Philipp Melanchthon, writing in 1546, Luther nailed a copy of the Ninety-five Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg that same day  church doors acting as the bulletin boards of his time  an event now seen as sparking the Protestant Reformation,\\"Luther's lavatory thrills experts\\", BBC News, October 22, 2004. and celebrated each year on 31 October as Reformation Day. Some scholars have questioned the accuracy of Melanchthon's account, noting that no contemporaneous evidence exists for it.Iserloh, Erwin. The Theses Were Not Posted. Toronto: Saunders of Toronto, Ltd., 1966. Others have countered that no such evidence is necessary, because this was the customary way of advertising an event on a university campus in Luther's day.Junghans, Helmer. \\"Luther's Wittenberg,\\" in McKim, Donald K. (ed.) The Cambridge Companion to Martin Luther. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003, 26. The Ninety-five Theses were quickly translated from Latin into German, printed, and widely copied, making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press.Brecht, Martin. Martin Luther. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985‚Äì93, 1:204-205. Within two weeks, the theses had spread throughout Germany; within two months throughout Europe. Justification by faith Schlosskirche (castle church) in Wittenberg to which Luther is said to have nailed his 95 Theses From 1510 to 1520, Luther lectured on the Psalms, the books of Hebrews, Romans, and Galatians. As he studied these portions of the Bible, he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Roman Catholic Church in new ways. He became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity, the most important of which, for Luther, was the doctrine of justification  God's act of declaring a sinner righteous  by faith alone through God's grace. He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God's grace, attainable only through faith in Jesus as the messiah.Wriedt, Markus. \\"Luther's Theology,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Luther. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003, 88‚Äì94. \\"This one and firm rock, which we call the doctrine of justification,\\" he wrote, \\"is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine, which comprehends the understanding of all godliness\\".Bouman, Herbert J. A. \\"The Doctrine of Justification in the Lutheran Confessions\\" , Concordia Theological Monthly, November 26, 1955, No. 11:801. Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God. Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God, Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ, imputed to Christians (rather than infused into them) through faith.Dorman, Ted M., \\"Justification as Healing: The Little-Known Luther ,\\" Quodlibet Journal: Volume 2 Number 3, Summer 2000. Retrieved 13 July 2007. \\"That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law,\\" he wrote. \\"Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ.\\" Faith, for Luther, was a gift from God. He explained his concept of \\"justification\\" in the Smalcald Articles: Response of the papacy Pope Leo X by Raphael Widening breach Luther's writings circulated widely, reaching France, England, and Italy as early as 1519, and students thronged to Wittenberg to hear him speak. He published a short commentary on Galatians and his Work on the Psalms. At the same time, he received deputations from Italy and from the Utraquists of Bohemia; Ulrich von Hutten and Franz von Sickingen offered to place Luther under their protection.Macauley Jackson, Samuel and Gilmore, George William. (eds.) \\"Martin Luther\\", The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, New York, London, Funk and Wagnalls Co., 1908‚Äì1914; Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House, 1951), 71. This early portion of Luther's career was one of his most creative and productive.Spitz, Lewis W. The Renaissance and Reformation Movements, St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1987, 338. Three of his best known works were published in 1520: To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church, and On the Freedom of a Christian. Finally on 30 May 1518, when the Pope demanded an explanation, Luther wrote a summary and explanation of his theses to the Pope. While the Pope may have conceded some of the points, he did not like the challenge to his authority so he summoned Luther to Rome to answer these. At that point Frederick the Wise, the Saxon Elector, intervened. He did not want one of his subjects to be sent to Rome to be judged by the Catholic clergy so he prevailed on the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who needed Frederick's support, to arrange a compromise. An arrangement was effected, however, whereby that summons was cancelled, and Luther went to Augsburg in October 1518 to meet the papal legate, Cardinal Thomas Cajetan. The argument was long but nothing was resolved. The Leipzig Debate took place in June and July 1519 at Pleissenburg Castle in Leipzig, Germany. Its purpose was to discuss Martin Luther's teachings, and was initiated and conducted in the presence of George, Duke of Saxony, an opponent of Luther. Excommunication First edition of Exsurge Domine On 15 June 1520, the Pope warned Luther with the papal bull (edict) Exsurge Domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings, including the Ninety-five Theses, within 60 days. That autumn, Johann Eck proclaimed the bull in Meissen and other towns. Karl von Miltitz, a papal nuncio, attempted to broker a solution, but Luther, who had sent the Pope a copy of On the Freedom of a Christian in October, publicly set fire to the bull and decretals at Wittenberg on 10 December 1520,Brecht, Martin. (tr. Wolfgang Katenz) \\"Luther, Martin,\\" in Hillerbrand, Hans J. (ed.) Oxford Encyclopedia of the Reformation. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996, 2:463. an act he defended in Why the Pope and his Recent Book are Burned and Assertions Concerning All Articles. As a consequence, Luther was excommunicated by Leo X on 3 January 1521, in the bull Decet Romanum Pontificem. Exile Diet of Worms Anton von Werner (1843‚Äì1915) The enforcement of the ban on the 41 sentences fell to the secular authorities. On 18 April 1521, Luther appeared as ordered before the Diet of Worms. This was a general assembly of the estates of the Holy Roman Empire that took place in Worms, a town on the Rhine. It was conducted from 28 January to 25 May 1521, with Emperor Charles V presiding. Prince Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, obtained an agreement that Luther would be promised safe passage to and from the meeting. Johann Eck, speaking on behalf of the Empire as assistant of the Archbishop of Trier, presented Luther with copies of his writings laid out on a table, and asked him if the books were his, and whether he stood by their contents. He confirmed he was the author, but requested time to think about the answer to the second question. He prayed, consulted friends, and gave his response the next day: \\"Unless I shall be convinced by the testimonies of the Scriptures or by clear reason ... I neither can nor will make any retraction, since it is neither safe nor honourable to act against conscience.\\"Macauley Jackson, Samuel and Gilmore, George William.

He is also famously said to have added: \\"Hier stehe ich. Ich kann nicht anders. Gott helfe mir. Amen.\\" (\\"Here I stand. I can do no other. God help me. Amen.\\").

Over the next five days, private conferences were held to determine Luther's fate. The Emperor presented the final draft of the Edict of Worms on May 25, 1521, declaring Luther an outlaw, banning his literature, and requiring his arrest: \\"We want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic\\".Bratcher, Dennis. \\"The Edict of Worms (1521),\\" in The Voice: Biblical and Theological Resources for Growing Christians. Retrieved 13 July 2007. It also made it a crime for anyone in Germany to give Luther food or shelter. It permitted anyone to kill Luther without legal consequence. The Edict was a divisive move that distressed more moderate men, in particular Desiderius Erasmus. Exile at Wartburg Castle Wartburg Castle, Eisenach Luther's disappearance during his return trip was planned. Frederick III, Elector of Saxony had him discreetly intercepted on his way home by masked horsemen and escorted to the security of the Wartburg Castle at Eisenach, where Luther grew a beard and lived incognito for nearly eleven months, pretending to be a knight called Junker J√∂rg.Schaff-Herzog, \\"Luther, Martin,\\" 72; Geoffrey Elton, Reformation Europe: 1517‚Äì1559, London: Fontana, 1963, p. 53; Diarmaid MacCulloch, Reformation: Europe's House Divided, 1490‚Äì1700, London: Allen Lane, 2003, p. 132.

The room in Wartburg where Luther translated the New Testament into German. There is an original first edition of the translation under the case on the desk. In On the Abrogation of the Private Mass, in the summer of 1521, Luther widened his target from individual pieties like indulgences and pilgrimages to doctrines at the heart of Church practices. His essay Concerning Confession rejected the Roman Catholic Church's requirement of confession, although he affirmed the value of private confession and absolution. In the introduction to his New Testament  published in September 1522 and selling 5,000 copies in two months  he explained that good works spring from faith; they do not produce it. In Wittenberg, Andreas Karlstadt, later supported by the ex- Augustinian Gabriel Zwilling, enacted a divisive programme of reform which exceeded anything envisaged by Luther and provoked disturbances, including a revolt by the Augustinian monks against their prior, the smashing of statues and images in churches, and denunciations of the magistracy. After secretly visiting Wittenberg in early December 1521, Luther wrote A Sincere Admonition by Martin Luther to All Christians to Guard Against Insurrection and Rebellion; but Wittenberg became more volatile after Christmas when a band of visionary zealots, the so-called Zwickau prophets, arrived preaching the equality of man, adult baptism, Christ's imminent return, and other revolutionary doctrines. Luther decided it was time to act. Return to Wittenberg Michael the Deacon and Martin Luther convene in Wittenberg, painted by In√®s Lee and commissioned by Sir John Das (2018). Around Christmas 1521, Anabaptists from Zwickau entered Wittenberg and caused considerable civil unrest. Thoroughly opposed to their radical views and fearful of their results, Luther secretly returned to Wittenberg on March 6, 1522. \\"During my absence,\\" he wrote to the Elector, \\"Satan has entered my sheepfold, and committed ravages which I cannot repair by writing, but only by my personal presence and living word.\\" For eight days in Lent, beginning on 9 March, Invocavit Sunday, and concluding the following Sunday, Luther preached eight sermons, which became known as the \\"Invocavit Sermons.\\" In these sermons, he hammered home the primacy of core Christian values such as love, patience, charity, and freedom, and reminded the citizens to trust God's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change: In 1534, Michael the Deacon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church travelled to Wittenberg to meet with Martin Luther, both of whom agreed that the Lutheran Mass and that used by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church were in agreement with one another. In their discussion, Michael the Deacon also affirmed Luther's Articles of the Christian Faith as a \\"good creed\\". Martin Luther saw that the Ethiopian Orthodox Church practiced elements of faith including \\"communion in both kind, vernacular Scriptures, and married clergy\\" and these practices became customary in the Lutheran Churches. For Lutherans, \\"the Ethiopian Church conferred legitimacy on Luther‚Äôs emerging Protestant vision of a church outside the authority of the Roman Catholic papacy\\" as it was \\"an ancient church with direct ties to the apostles\\". Political and religious conflict What had started as a strictly theological and academic debate had now turned into something of a social and political conflict as well, pitting Luther, his German allies and Northern European supporters against Charles V, France, the Italian Pope, their territories and other allies. The conflict would erupt into a religious war after Luther's death, fueled by the political climate of the Holy Roman Empire and strong personalities on both sides. After the Diets of Nuremberg failed to accomplish the goal of arresting Luther, in 1526, at the First Diet of Speyer it was decided that until a General Council could meet and settle the theological issues raised by Martin Luther, the Edict of Worms would not be enforced and each Prince could decide if Lutheran teachings and worship would be allowed in his territories. In 1529, at the Second Diet of Speyer, the decision the previous Diet of Speyer was reversed ‚Äî despite the strong protests of the Lutheran princes, free cities and some Zwinglian territories. These states quickly became known as Protestants. At first, this term Protestant was used politically for the states that resisted the Edict of Worms. Over time, however, this term came to be used for the religious movements that opposed the Roman Catholic tradition in the 16th century. University of Jena around 1600. Jena was the center of Gnesio-Lutheran activity during the controversies leading up to the Formula of Concord. Lutheranism would become known as a separate movement after the 1530 Diet of Augsburg, which was convened by Charles V to try to stop the growing Protestant movement. At the Diet, Philipp Melanchthon presented a written summary of Lutheran beliefs called the Augsburg Confession. Several of the German princes (and later, kings and princes of other countries) signed the document to define \\"Lutheran\\" territories. The Roman Catholic response to it was Confutatio Augustana, also at the 1530 Diet of Augsburg. In response to the Confutatio, Philipp Melanchthon prepared the Prima delineatio. Although this was rejected by the Emperor, Melanchthon improved it as a private document until it was signed at a meeting of the Schmalkaldic League as the 1537 Apology of the Augsburg Confession, but the Catholic side did not respond to it until the 1545‚Äì63 Council of Trent. In turn several Lutheran states led by Elector John Frederick I of Saxony and Landgrave Philip I of Hesse met at the town of Schmalkalden, where they established the Schmalkaldic League in 1531. At first, the Nuremberg Religious Peace of 1532 granted religious liberty to members of the Schmalkaldic League. During this time, Martin Luther used his political influence to prevent war, but recognized the right of rulers to defend their lands in the event of an invasion (see Luther's concept of the Beerwolf ruler).Brecht, Martin. Martin Luther. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985‚Äì93, 3:199-228. Martin Luther and the Reformation also brought a period of radical change to church architecture and design. According to the ideals of the Protestant reformation, the spoken word, the sermon, should be central act in the church service. This implied that the pulpit became the focal point of the church interior and that churches should be designed to allow all to hear and see the minister. The focus was on the preaching of the Word, rather than a sacerdotal emphasis. Holy Communion tables became wood to emphasize that Christ's sacrifice was made once for all and were made more immediate to the congregation to emphasize man's direct access to God through Christ. Therefore, catholic churches were redecorated when they became reformed: Paintings and statues of saints were removed and sometimes the altar table was placed in front of the pulpit, as at Strasbourg Cathedral in 1524. The pews were turned towards the pulpit. The first newly built Protestant church was the court chapel of Neuburg Castle in 1543, followed by the court chapel of Hartenfels Castle in Torgau, consecrated by Martin Luther on 5 October 1544. Front page of the Peace of Augsburg Luther died in 1546. In 1547, the Schmalkaldic War started out as a battle between two Lutheran rulers, but soon, Holy Roman Imperial forces joined the battle and conquered the members of the Schmalkaldic League, oppressing and exiling many Lutherans as they enforced the terms of the Augsburg Interim until religious freedom was secured for Lutherans through the Peace of Passau of 1552 and the Peace of Augsburg of 1555.Fuerbringer, L., Concordia Cyclopedia Concordia Publishing House. 1927. p. 425 Religious disputes between the Crypto-Calvinists, Philippists, Sacramentarians, Ubiquitarians, and the Gnesio-Lutherans raged within Lutheranism during a series of controversies Concordia: doctrinal harmony However, the Lutheran movement was far from defeated. In 1577, the next generation of Lutheran theologians gathered the work of the previous generation to define the doctrine of the persisting Lutheran church. This document is known as the Formula of Concord. In 1580, it was published with the Augsburg Confession, the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, the Large and Small Catechisms of Martin Luther, the Smalcald Articles and the Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope. Together they were distributed in a volume entitled The Book of Concord. This doctrinal standard replaced earlier, incomplete collections of doctrine, unifying all German Lutherans with identical doctrine and beginning the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy. Early Orthodoxy: 1580-1600 The Book of Concord gave inner unity to Lutheranism, which had many controversies, mostly between Gnesio-Lutherans and Philippists, in Roman Catholic outward pressure and in alleged \\"crypto-Calvinistic\\" influence. Lutheran theology became more stable in its theoretical definitions. High Orthodoxy: 1600-1685 Lutheran scholasticism developed gradually, especially for the purpose of arguing with the Jesuits, and it was finally established by Johann Gerhard. Abraham Calovius represents the climax of the scholastic paradigm in orthodox Lutheranism. Other orthodox Lutheran theologians were e.g. Martin Chemnitz, Aegidius Hunnius, Leonhard Hutter, Nicolaus Hunnius, Jesper Rasmussen Brochmand, Salomo Glassius, Johann H√ºlsemann, Johann Conrad Dannhauer, Johannes Andreas Quenstedt, Johann Friedrich K√∂nig and Johann Wilhelm Baier. The theological heritage of Philip Melanchthon rose up again in the Helmstedt School and especially in the theology of Georgius Calixtus, which caused the Syncretistic Controversy. Another theological issue was the Crypto-Kenotic Controversy.Lutheran Theology after 1580 article in Christian Cyclopedia Late Orthodoxy (1685‚Äì1730) Halle, Germany, a center of Pietism Generally, the 17th century was a more difficult time than the earlier period of Reformation, due in part to the Thirty Years' War. Finland suffered a severe famine in 1696‚Äì1697 as part of what is now called the Little Ice Age, and almost one third of the population died.History of Finland. Finland chronology , This struggle to survive can often be seen in hymns and devotional writings. Late Orthodoxy was torn by influences from rationalism, philosophy based on reason, and Pietism, a revival movement in Lutheranism that sought to emphasise the importance of personal devotion, morality, emotions, and the study of Scripture. After a century of vitality, the Pietist theologians Philipp Jakob Spener and August Hermann Francke warned that Lutheran orthodoxy degenerated life-changing scriptural truth into meaningless intellectualism and Formalism. Pietism increased at the expense of orthodoxy, but their emphasis on personal morality and sanctification came at the expense of teaching the doctrine of justification. The Pietisitic focus on stirring up devout emotions was susceptible to the arguments of rationalist philosophy.Fuerbringer, L., Concordia Cyclopedia Concordia Publishing House. 1927. p. 426 The last prominent orthodox Lutheran theologian before the Enlightenment and Neology was David Hollatz. A later orthodox theologian, Valentin Ernst L√∂scher, took part in a controversy against Pietism. Mediaeval mystical tradition continued in the works of Martin Moller, Johann Arndt and Joachim L√ºtkemann. Pietism became a rival of orthodoxy but adopted some orthodox devotional literature, such as those of Arndt, Christian Scriver and Stephan Pr√§torius, which have often been later mixed with Pietistic literature. Rationalism and revivals University of Jena at 1770, no longer a stronghold of orthodox Lutheranism. During the 1700s, Germany turned to rationalism. Rationalism Into this complicated religious scene, rationalist philosophers from France and England had an enormous impact, along with the German rationalists Christian Wolff, Gottfried Leibniz and Immanuel Kant. Instead of faith in God and trust in the promises of the Bible and Christian doctrine, people were taught to trust their own reason and senses. At the most, rationalism left behind a belief in a vague supernaturalism. Morality and church-going plummeted together. Genuine piety was found almost solely in small Pietist gatherings. However, some of the laity preserved Lutheran orthodoxy from both Pietism and rationalism through reusing old catechisms, hymnbooks, postils, and devotional writings, including those written by Johann Gerhard, Heinrich M√ºller, and Christian Scriver.Devotional Literature Project Aside from that, however, Lutheranism vanished in the wake of rationalist philosophy. Revivals The Awakening Napoleon's invasion of Germany promoted rationalism and angered German Lutherans, stirring up a desire among the people to preserve Luther's theology from the rationalist threat. This Erweckung, or Awakening, argued that reason was insufficient and pointed out the importance of emotional religious experience. Small groups sprang up, often in universities, which devoted themselves to Bible study, reading devotional writings, and revival meetings.Suelflow, Roy A. Walking With Wise Men. Milwaukee: South Wisconsin District (LCMS), 1967. p. 10. Members of this movement eventually took to restoring the traditional liturgy and doctrine of the Lutheran church in the Neo-Lutheran movement. A layman, Luther scholar Johann Georg Hamann, became famous for countering rationalism and advancing the Awakening.Gritsch, Eric W. A History of Lutheranism. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2002. p. 180. This Awakening also swept through Scandinavia, influenced by both German Neo-Lutheranism and Pietism. Danish pastor and philosopher N. F. S. Grundtvig reshaped church life throughout Denmark through a reform movement beginning in 1830. He also wrote about 1,500 hymns, including God's Word Is Our Great Heritage.Gritsch, Eric W. A History of Lutheranism. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2002. p. 182. In Norway, Hans Nielsen Hauge, a lay street preacher, emphasized spiritual discipline and sparked the Haugean movement.Gritsch, Eric W. A History of Lutheranism. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2002. p. 183. In Sweden, Lars Levi L√¶stadius began the Laestadian movement that emphasized moral reform. In Finland, a farmer, Paavo Ruotsalainen, started a reform movement when he took to preaching about repentance and prayer. Old Lutherans In 1817, Frederick William III of Prussia ordered the Lutheran and Reformed churches in his territory to unite, forming the Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union. The unification of the two branches of German Protestantism sparked the Schism of the Old Lutherans. Many Lutherans, called \\"Old Lutherans\\", despite imprisonment and military force, chose to leave the established churches and form independent church bodies, or \\"free churches\\" while others left for the United States and Australia. A similar legislated merger in Silesia prompted thousands to join the Old Lutheran movement. The dispute over ecumenism overshadowed other controversies within German Lutheranism. Neo- Lutherans Despite political meddling in church life, local leaders sought to restore and renew Christianity. High school teacher August Friedrich Christian Vilmar turned from rationalism to faith, and in doing so, realized the importance of the unaltered Augsburg Confession and the other Lutheran Confessions of faith. An advocate of the Neo-Lutheran movement (which was allied with the Old Lutherans against rationalism), he worked to renew the church through the use of the Lutheran Confessions. Neo-Lutheran Johann Konrad Wilhelm L√∂he and Old Lutheran free church leader Friedrich August Br√ºnnChristian Cyclopedia article on Br√ºnn both sent young men overseas to serve as Pastors to German Americans, while the Inner Mission focused on renewing the situation home.Gritsch, Eric W. A History of Lutheranism. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2002. p. 184. Johann Gottfried Herder, superintendent at Weimar and part of the Inner Mission movement, joined with the Romantic movement with his quest to preserve human emotion and experience from rationalism.Gritsch, Eric W. A History of Lutheranism. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2002. p. 187. Results Stormtroopers holding German Christians propaganda during the Church Council elections on July 23, 1933 at St. Mary's Church, Berlin. The Neo-Lutheran movement managed to slow secularism and counter atheistic Marxist socialism, but it did not fully succeed in Europe. It partly succeeded in continuing the Pietist movement's drive to right social wrongs and focus on individual conversion. The Neo- Lutheran call to renewal failed to achieve widespread popular acceptance because it was rooted in a lofty, idealistic Romanticism that did not connect with an increasingly industrialized and secularized Europe.Gritsch, Eric W. A History of Lutheranism. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2002. p. 188. At best, the work of local leaders resulted in specific areas with vibrant spiritual renewal, but people in Lutheran areas overall continued to become increasingly distant from church life. Beginning in 1867, confessional and liberal minded German Lutherans joined together to form the Common Evangelical Lutheran Conference against the ever looming prospect of a legally binding union with the Reformed.Gritsch, Eric W. A History of Lutheranism. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2002. p. 185. However, they failed to reach a consensus among themselves on how much agreement in doctrine is necessary for church union. Eventually, the fascist German Christians movement forced the final national merger of Lutherans and Reformed into a single Reich Church, now the Evangelical Church in Germany, in 1933.

It is believed that he was a member of a writer's circle, and his work was not completely his own. He states that he > ...doesn't deny that in his Eunuch he has transported characters out of the > Greek: but ... if the same characters will not be permitted, how is it more > permissible to depict a servant on the run, or to make use of good old > women, evil courtesans, a gluttonous parasite, a braggart soldier, a > changeling, an old man duped by a servant, or even love, hate, and > suspicion? In short, nothing is said that has not been said before. Plot This play centers on several interconnecting plots; the first forms the framework for the play‚Äîthe love between a young Athenian man Phaedria and a foreign born courtesan named Thais. Introduced in Act I, Scene i, Phaedria and his wise-cracking slave, Parmeno, discuss Phaedria's situation. Before the curtain rose, Phaedria had been shut out of Thais' house, and he contemplates what he should do. \\"What, therefore am I to do? Will I not go? Not even now, when I freely summoned? Or is it better for me to prepare myself to endure the insults of whores? She shuts me out, then she calls me back. Should I go back?\\" (I.i.47‚Äì49) Offering philosophic advice, Parmeno encourages the love- sick Phaedria, \\"If you can go, there's nothing better or braver: but if you begin, and do not stoutly hang on, and when you cannot bear it, when no one seeks you out, with peace not having been made, you go to her freely, saying that you love her, and cannot bear it, you're done: it's over. You're through. She will play with you when she senses you are defeated.\\" (I.i.50‚Äì55) He then offers his a famous line: > All these vices are in love: injuries, > Suspicions, enmity, offenses, > War, peace restored. If you think that uncertain things > can be made certain by reason, you'll accomplish nothing more than > if you strived to go insane by sanity. Parmeno then encourages Phaedria to \\"not add beyond the troubles love already has,\\" while buying myself back from her for \\"as little as possible\\" (I.i.75‚Äì80). There is obvious slave imagery here. At the end of the scene, Thais emerges from the house. It's quite obvious that she's perturbed over her actions that irritated Phaedria, and caused the deliberations of the previous scene. She says, \\"Oh, miserable me! I fear that Phaedria bore it quite poorly, and accepted the action in another manner than I did it, because yesterday he was not sent in\\" (I.ii.80‚Äì83). Seeing Phaedria and Parmeno in the street, she calls them over to talk; obviously Phaedria, the perfect elegiac lover, is caught up \\"shaking and trembling all over\\" at the sight of her, and Parmeno is the hard-nosed interrogator about her intentions. Thais launches into a very lengthy explanation of her history; during this tale, the second subplot is introduced: the attentions of Thraso. He is then asked by Thais to leave town for a few days so that she can pay attention to a rich soldier Thraso. Thraso has a present that she is interested in (this present happens to be a slave girl called Pamphila. She comes from Phaedria's home town and is Thais's sister ‚Äì this is known to Thais but not to Thraso). In doing this, Thais plans to re-establish contact with Pamphila and to improve her social standing in Athens by returning Pamphila to her Athenian family, represented by her brother Chremes. With their relationship already on the rocks, Phaedria sees this as the last straw. Nonetheless, Phaedria loves her and hopes that she will be his in the end. To show his love for her, he arranges two presents for her before he leaves: an Aethiopian slave girl and a eunuch. Phaedria has a younger brother, Chaerea, who is just returning from military service when all these events are unfolding. At the port, Chaerea sees Pamphila coming off the boat on her way to be delivered to Thais and he is overcome by her beauty. He tries to follow her but he loses her. Luckily, however, Chaerea runs into his family's servant Parmeno who has just seen Pamphila go by, escorted by Thraso's servant Gnatho. Parmeno reveals to Chaerea that the girl he is chasing is the gift of the soldier to Thais, and that he himself is supposed to deliver a eunuch to Thais's house for Phaedria (one of Phaedria's gifts). Based on a joking suggestion by Parmeno, Chaerea decides to substitute himself for the eunuch in order to get into Thais's house and he forces Parmeno to cooperate. Since he has been away on military service, Thais and her household staff do not know his face. Chaerea's plan works, and he is accepted as a eunuch and put in charge of guarding the girl with whom he is so strongly infatuated. When he is left alone with her, he rapes her, and then, discovered by Thais's maid Pythias, he flees the scene. Thais's plan to get in good favour with Pamphila's Athenian family seems to be ruined. At this point Phaedria returns and discovers what his brother has done. Chaerea is dragged back to Thais's house and explains his love for Pamphila and agrees to marry her. Chremes is grateful for the return of his long-lost sister, Phaedria and Thais are reconciled, and the soldier and Phaedria agree to share Thais. Later allusion Augustine of Hippo in The City of God (II.7) cites Chaerea's speech from Act III, Scene 5, on the descent of Jupiter onto the lap of Dana√´ in the form of a golden shower as an authoritative precedent to justify his own licentious behaviour as likely to corrupt schoolboys. Dante alludes to Terence's Thais in Canto 18 of the Inferno, where he encounters the flatterers, who are covered with human waste. Virgil points to one of the suffering souls: :At that juncture, my leader said to me, : ‚ÄúNow send your gaze a little further forward : So that your eye may rest upon the face :Of that slovenly and disheveled slattern 130 : Scratching herself there with her shitty nails, : Who can‚Äôt decide between standing and squatting. :That is Tha√Øs, the whore who once replied : To a lover asking, ‚ÄòHave I found much favor : With you?‚Äô‚Äî‚ÄòIndeed, I‚Äôd say the very most!‚Äô :And let this be enough for our perusal.‚Äù From an unpublished translation of the Inferno by Peter D'Epiro.

This company is quite similar to Moores, a well-known company which also sells menswear. Tip Top Tailors operates 102 stores across Canada and is a division of Grafton-Fraser Inc. The first Tip Top Tailors opened in 1909. History Tip Top Tailors was a Canadian menswear clothing retailer founded in Toronto in 1909 by Polish-Jewish immigrant David Dunkelman (1883‚Äì1978). He rented his first store at 245 Yonge Street, Toronto, selling tailored suits for $14. The name of the chain was chosen by a customer in a contest. A now landmark building that housed the manufacturing, warehousing, retail and office operations for Tip Top Tailors was built at 637 Lake Shore Boulevard West, Toronto, Ontario. This building was designed by architect and engineer Roy H. Bishop in a classic Art Deco style. Construction was completed in 1929. Founder David Dunkelman's son Benjamin Dunkelman (1913‚Äì1997) served as president of Tip Top Tailors after his father stepped down in 1948 until he eventually sold the company to the newly formed Dylex Limited in 1967. The history of Tip Top Tailors after 1967 is inextricably intertwined with that of Dylex Limited. The first discussions concerning the formation of Dylex took place during a lunchtime meeting in December 1966. On one side of the table sat Jimmy Kay, a Toronto-based entrepreneur with business interests in housewares, plastics, and lighting. On the other side sat representatives of the Posluns family, who for three generations had been involved in the Toronto garment industry. The Posluns and Kay had never met each other prior to the meeting (an auditor who worked for both Kay and the Posluns had arranged the meeting) but they were both interested in acquiring the same company, Tip Top Tailors. By 1967 Tip Top Tailors had lost its luster and had deteriorated into \\"an old broken-down chain\\" according to Toronto broker Donald Tigert. The Posluns were primarily interested in acquiring the company's 5-story head office building on Lake Shore Boulevard. They had previously approached the Dunkleman family about buying the building alone, but the Dunkleman family declined the offer, wishing to sell the entire business if they sold it at all. Jimmy Kay, however, was more interested in buying the Tip Top Tailors chain of stores than the head office building, a proposition the Dunklemans also rejected. Separately, each side had failed in their bid to acquire Tip Top Tailors, but during the course of lunch they agreed to pool their efforts and offer the Dunklemans the deal they wanted. Thus began a business relationship that would endure for the next quarter century. The Dunklemans agreed to the joint bid by the Posluns and Kay, who formed a new company named Dylex, which concurrently went public, to serve as the holding company for Tip Top Tailors. The name Dylex, which had once been used by Kay for one of his holding companies, was an acronym for \\"damn your lousy excuses,\\" a phrase that reflected the mentality of the company's new management. Kay and the dominant Posluns family member, Wilfred Posluns, established a reputation for acquiring ailing retail chains and injecting them with new life, a characteristic of their jointly controlled company as it developed into a retail giant. Tip Top Tailors was the first example of a rapid turnaround, a company whose former executives offered numerous reasons for its anemic performance, none of which were accepted by Kay or Posluns. Instead, Dylex management applied what one industry pundit characterized as a \\"don't-stand-for-any-nonsense\\" style of management, sharpening the chain's focus on its target clientele. In its first year under Dylex control, the floundering 52-store chain regained its lost vitality, registering $37 million (CAD) in sales by the end of 1967. After a decline in its numerous retail enterprises, Dylex Limited sold the Tip Top Tailors chain to Grafton-Fraser Inc. in July 2000. In May 2007 majority ownership of Grafton-Fraser was sold to an affiliate of Gordon Brothers Group.

It is the longest song on the album, and the third longest song the band has ever recorded, after \\"Cemetery Gates\\" (7:03), and \\"Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks\\" (7:01). An early mix of the song was released on the 20th anniversary edition of The Great Southern Trendkill. Background Pantera bassist Rex Brown said about \\"Floods\\": > That was one of my favorite bass lines on that song. We'd rehearsed it a > couple of times and Dime and I sat down for quite a while with that. It was > more of trying to get yourself in a mellow mood. It's a blazing solo with a > really cool rhythm section underneath it - I'm really proud of the bass > line. I think that was Dime's favorite solo on that song. The lyrics of the song tell about acts committed by mankind such as rape, murder, and war, and contain themes of a plea to God to flood the earth in a fashion like that described in the biblical Book of Genesis. Guitar solo The song features one of Dimebag Darrell's most popular solos. The solo was originally a riff written by guitarist Dimebag in the mid 1980s, and footage exists of him performing these licks as early as 1986. Guitar World magazine voted Dimebag Darrell's guitar solo in \\"Floods\\" as the 19th greatest of all- time. Darrell built the solo from his improvised solos he played in concerts. Darrell on the solo: Darrell also said: > I picked up the idea of doubling from Randy Rhoads. It seemed appropriate to > start off in a slow, melodic fashion and then build and build and build to > the climax with the big harmonic squeals at the end.

Reception Classic Rock writer Stephen Dalton described \\"Floods\\" as \\"Pantera's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'\\". Dalton also described it as \\"a seven-minute, shape-shifting, post-apocalyptic epic featuring one of Dimebag Darrell's finest solos, an octave-vaulting baroque ejaculation that sounds like Brian May on steroids\\".

It is named after Ing. Vojtƒõch Kry≈°p√≠n, director of one of the Czechoslovak locomotive manufacturers, who invented the system. It was accepted in September 1923 by the decree of the Ministry of Railways under reference number 54 024/v/3-23. Standard gauge vehicles For standard gauge vehicles, the class name had the form Y ASW.GNNN. Here Y is the type of the vehicle: * Y is missing: steam locomotives * A: draisines, track motor cars; later used for accumulator locomotives * E: DC current electrical locomotives * S: AC current electrical locomotives * ES: electrical locomotives capable of using both AC and DC current. * EM: DC electrical railway motor cars * SM: AC electrical railway motor cars * T: diesel locomotives * TL: gas-turbine locomotives * M: railway motor cars * ET, TA: hybrid locomotives A is the number of live or coupled axles. S marks the maximum speed in km/h. It is constructed as (max. speed - 30 km/h) div 10 km/h. For example, if the maximum speed is 100 km/h, S = (100-30)/10 = 7. If the maximum speed exceeds 120 km/h, 9 is used. If it is less than 30 km/h, 0 is used. W+10 is the weight per live or coupled axle in metric tonnes. For example, W=8 means the vehicle has 18 tonnes per live or coupled axle. G is the so-called design-group. As you can see from the above explanation, even very different vehicles can have the same Y ASW. G is used to distinguish between various designs with the same number of live axles, maximum speed and weight. For example, 464.0 and 464.1 were totally different designs. NNN is the \\"serial\\" number - it is 001 for the first locomotive of class Y ASW.G produced, 002 for the second one and so on. Narrow gauge vehicles For narrow gauge vehicles, the class had the form Y AW.GNNN where Y was one of the following * U: narrow gauge steam locomotives * TU: narrow gauge diesel locomotives * MU: narrow gauge railway motor cars * EMU: DC electric narrow gauge railway motor cars All other symbols had the same meaning as for the standard gauge vehicles. Examples * 310 ... steam locomotive, 3 live or coupled axles, max. speed 40 km/h or less, 10 tonnes or less per live or coupled axle * 498 ... steam locomotive, 4 live or coupled axles, max. speed 120 km/h or greater, 18 tonnes per live or coupled axle * T478 ... diesel locomotive, 4 live or coupled axles, max. speed 100 km/h, 18 tonnes per live or coupled axle * ES499 ... electric locomotive capable of using both AC and DC current, 4 live or coupled axles, max. speed 120 km/h or greater, 19 or more tonnes per live or coupled axle. * TU47 ... diesel locomotive, narrow gauge, 4 live or coupled axles, 17 tonnes per live or coupled axle. Notes on electrification systems used in Czechoslovakia Czechoslovakia (and the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic as its descendants) used two different main railway electrification systems. The railways in the north part of the country are electrified with 3000 V DC, while south is electrified with 25 kV AC, 50 Hz. This has historical reasons. Massive electrification started in 1950s when AC locomotives were difficult to build. However, as technology advanced, AC locomotives became easier to build and the AC current was used because it is more economical. Before the massive electrification started in 1950s, other systems were also used, including three-phase current. Nowadays, the only line in the Czech Republic with such a system remaining is T√°bor-Bechynƒõ using 1500 V DC. The E class refers both to the 3000 V DC and 1500 V locomotives. * http://droopy.czweb.org/index.php?kapitola=6 Locomotives of the Czech Republic ","title":"Kry≈°p√≠n's system"},{"id":"5802131","text":"Nukumanu, formerly Tasman Islands, is an atoll of Papua New Guinea, located in the Southwestern Pacific Ocean, 4 degrees south of the equator.

Nukumanu's most recent claim to fame is that it was the last place on the path of Amelia Earhart before she and her co-pilot Fred Noonan disappeared forever into the vast Pacific Ocean. Their last known position report was near the Nukumanu Islands, about 800 miles (1,300 km) into the flight. The land resources of the Nukumanu people are quite few and they grow a kind of taro and bananas. Coconuts are an integral part of the islanders' diet with the soft inside being a staple food and coconut flesh being consumed with raw fish and clams. They are also competent fishermen, who dive for b√™che-de-mer in the lagoon. This is exported mainly to Asia, and along with trochus shells, used to make mother-of-pearl, they comprise the backbone of the Nukumanu economy. Anthropological studies This atoll has a Polynesian population whose ancestors migrated westwards out of Polynesia. Their language is classified in the Samoic Outlier branch of Polynesian.[Polynesian languages Ethnologue - Nukumanu Language] The Nukumanu Islands, together with neighboring Ontong Java retain a Polynesian character despite their location in the Melanesian Archipelago of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands respectively. The first serious research on Nukumanu's inhabitants was conducted by German ethnographers Ernst Sarfert and Hans Damm, during a German scientific expedition of the Southern Seas that took place in 1908-1910.

The greatest of all Sage in Indian Hindu Mythology Maharishi Dadhichi was born here and spend his whole life till last breath. Dadhichi, also known as Dadhyancha, is an important character in Hindu mythology. He is revered amongst the greatest of sages and is portrayed as an example that no sacrifice is too great when the result is the good of the world. His bones are used as a symbol on India's highest award for gallantry \\"Param Vir Chakra\\" as \\"vajra\\". He was one of the greatest among clan of bhrigus. He is credited with giving up his life in order to allow the Devas to use his bones to make weapons to defeat the Asura Vritra. Dadhichi was the son of sage Atharvan and his wife Chitti (Bhagavata Purana, 4/1). Atharvan who is also known as Bhrigu rishi (Manas putra of Brahma) attained the name the Atharvan as he authored (\\"Heard\\") Atharvaveda. Chitti was sage Kardam's daughter. Dadhichi's wife's name was Swarcha and his son was Pippalada rishi, a great sage himself, who is supposed to be associated with the Pippalada school of thought and associated with the origin of the Pra≈õna Upanishad. He had established his ashram in Misrikh, in Naimisharanya near Lucknow, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Naimisharanya has been cited in all of the puranas as the place of his ashram, where it is still in existence. The current place of Sabarmati Ashram in Ahemdabad, is also one of the ancient sites of his ashram. In the ancient times sages used to travel long distances, so may be he stayed near sabarmati river for some time. His name is seen to occur in the first mandala of Rigveda (Bhagavata Purana, Srimad Devi Bhagavatam and in the Puranas. He is said to be the forefather of many other great rishis and various clans, such as the Dadheech Brahmins (Dynasty/clan) in India claim to be his descendants. Dadhichi is believed to have authored the famous composition of \\"Narayanm Kawacham\\", which is a famous hymn in southern India and sung for power and peace. He was a passer-by of Madhuvidhya to ashvin kumars which he learned himself from others. Dadhichi is associated with many Hindu legends and is sometimes portrayed as having a horse's head.

The population in 2011 was 1,499,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 55.33 km¬≤.Eurostat History Alvega- Ortiga Railway Station On top of a hilltop encountered to the southwest of the confluence of the Tagus River with the Lampreia River, in the area of Barca de Bandos, are the ruins of a fortress. The vestiges of the surface area indicate the presence of the Phoenicians and Greeks. By the time the Romans began occupying the Iberian peninsula around 130, the area was already an important community, designated Ayre or Aritium, with river port that provided a military connection between Lisbon and M√©rida. The destruction of the Roman fort was attributed to the invasion of Vandals, on their way to Andalusia. Of this Roman civitas there are still some buildings, house foundations and graves, underground galleries, likely the ruins of an aqueduct, military roads, and along the Tagus, there are markers to indicate a Roman bridge. During the Muslim occupation the city continued to support a populous community. The toponymy, Alvega, came from the Arab name Alrega, with its history extending as far back as the Muslim occupation of Hispania. Geography The parish is located in the easternmost tip of the municipality, neighbouring with the municipalities of Ma√ß√£o to the north, with Gavi√£oto the east and with Ponte de Sor to the south. The parish includes the localities of Alvega, Areia de Baixo, Areia de Cima, Casa Branca, Casal Ventoso, Lampreia, Monte Galego, Portelas and Tubaral. It is situated on the left margin of the Tagus River, from the municipal seat of Abrantes. It is the centre of the Beira Baixa rail-line, in addition to having two river ports along the Tagus in Alvega and Barca de Bandos. Economy Alvega is essentially rural, involved in the cultivation of cereal grains, cork and olive orchards, as well as the raising of goats and sheep. In addition to extraction of sand from the river, the fishery, horticulture and fructiculture, among other activities are important parts of the local primary sector economies. Meanwhile, there are portions of the community involved in traditional tin, carpentry, tailoring and embroidery crafts, as a source of tourist dollars.

Background Chinwe Obaji was born in Ezinihitte-Mbaise in Imo State. From 1980 she was a lecturer and administrator at Michael Okpara College of Agriculture, Umuagwo, Imo State in Nigeria. Ministerial position Chinwe Obaji, as Education Minister, tried to resuscitate the Inspectorate Division of the Federal Ministry of Education. She started the one-meal-a-day project in some pilot primary schools across the country. She directed that Universities should administer the Post University Matriculation Examination to candidate students in an effort by bypass the inefficiency of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB). Notably, in support of her directive. However, there was controversy over the fees charged by universities for the test. In an October 2005 meeting between the Federal Ministry of Education, the National Universities Commission (NUC) and Joint Admission and Matriculation Board, it was unanimously agreed to peg the test fee at N1,000. Answering questions in the House of Representative in November 2005, Chinwe Obaji said that any university that collected more than N1,000 from candidates seeking admission after the post JAMB screening had done so in violation of her directive. The House of Representations later cancelled the directive. In April 2006, Chinwe Obaji detailed reforms to the design of the basic education system to ensure that every Nigerian child at least has access to basic education. The government set up a system of reprimanding parents who do not register their children for school, and started to recruit 40,000 teachers for rural communities. She stated that the Universal Basic Education (UBE) program aimed at enhancing \\"unhindered access to quality basic education to the children, especially to the girl-child\\".

It was founded by Robert I, Count of Dreux, a son of Louis VI of France, who was given the County of Dreux as his appanage. The Counts of Dreux were relatively minor nobles in France. The senior comital line became extinct in 1345. In 1212 the French king needed an obedient vassal to marry Alix, Duchess of Brittany and turned to his cousin Peter, a younger son of the Count of Dreux. Peter's marriage to the heiress of Brittany placed the House of Dreux in one of the most important fiefs of France. Brittany became a lay peerage of the France in 1297 and was formally recognised as a duchy (rather than a county) by the French court. The Dreux rulers of Brittany descending from Peter used a canton ermine to mark them as cadets of the House of Dreux. Sometime in 1316, John III, Duke of Brittany adopted the plain ermine as the arms of the Duchy of Brittany. At the death of John III in 1341, the succession to the duchy was contested by the duke's niece, Joan of Penthi√®vre, daughter of his full- brother, and John of Montfort, the duke's younger half-brother. Traditionally, females had been able to succeed as duchesses, but this practice was not consistent with most apanages granted by the French crown, which usually preferred male-only succession. Joan had married Charles of Blois, a nephew of King Philip VI, who supported their cause. Edward III of England, meanwhile, supported the Montforts. John died in 1345 from an illness caught while besieging Quimper. His young children were placed into English custody. John's son, John was allowed to return to Brittany in 1362. Meanwhile, Charles was captured by the English in 1347 and imprisoned until 1356. Charles ultimately died at the Battle of Auray in 1364, fighting the forces of the younger John. In the Treaty of Gu√©rande, which ended the War of the Breton Succession, the Duchy of Brittany was made hereditary in the males of the Montfort line, at the termination of which it was to pass to the males of Blois-Penthi√®vre. In 1420 the Penthi√®vre family imprisoned the duke in a failed attempt to regain Brittany. When the last male Montfort duke, Francis II of Brittany, died, the duchy passed to his daughter, Anne of Brittany.

Etymology  Several reasons are offered for the origin of the name.http://travel.bhushavali.com/search?q=mohanur. Retrieved 2012-06-27 # One reason given is that the people of this region worked as middle men or agents in the ancient era. Mugavar is the term in Tamizh for agents. So the place came to be known as Mugavanur which derived later on as Moganur. # Another reason is that Lord Shiva wanted to see the reincarnation of Lord Vishnu as a woman i.e. Mohini, here in this location. # Another reason goes that once all the heavenly devas went in search of Lord Shiva accompanied by Ganga. But he was alone there. So they started their search for Ganga and went to Lord Muruga. He too started to search her. Searching for her, they reached Madurai where Madurai Meenakshi directed them towards north near Cauvery. Lord Muruga came to Cauvery, yet didn't find her. So He went on a severe meditation on her. Ganga appeared in front of him. She was so overwhelmed by his motherly love and hugged him. Since the mother-son love between them was found here, the place was called Maganur. Magan means \\"son\\" in Tamizh. Maganur later derived as Mohanur.

Situated below Gran Sasso mountain in Italy, it is well known for particle physics research by the INFN. In addition to a surface portion of the laboratory, there are extensive underground facilities beneath the mountain. The nearest towns are L'Aquila and Teramo. The facility is located about 120 km from Rome. The primary mission of the laboratory is to host experiments that require a low background environment in the fields of astroparticle physics and nuclear astrophysics and other disciplines that can profit of its characteristics and of its infrastructures. The LNGS is, like the three other European underground astroparticle laboratories (Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane, Laboratorio subterr√°neo de Canfranc, and Boulby Underground Laboratory), a member of the coordinating group ILIAS. Facilities The laboratory consists of a surface facility, located within the Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park, and extensive underground facilities located next to the 10 km long Traforo del Gran Sasso freeway tunnel. The first large experiments at LNGS ran in 1989; the facilities were later expanded, and it is now the largest underground laboratory in the world. There are three main barrel vaulted experimental halls, each approximately 20 m wide, 18 m tall, and 100 m long.

Research projects Neutrino research Since late August 2006, CERN has directed a beam of muon neutrinos from the CERN SPS accelerator to the Gran Sasso lab, 730 km away, where they are detected by the OPERA and ICARUS detectors, in a study of neutrino oscillations that will improve on the results of the Fermilab to MINOS experiment. In May 2010, Lucia Votano, Director of the Gran Sasso laboratories, announced that \\"[t]he OPERA experiment has reached its first goal: the detection of a tau neutrino obtained from the transformation of a muon neutrino, which occurred during the journey from Geneva to the Gran Sasso Laboratory.\\"Particle Chameleon Caught in the act of Changing, Press Release, CERN, 31 May 2010, accessed 22 November 2016. This finding indicates a deficiency in the Standard Model of particle physics, as neutrinos would have to have mass for this change to occur. An effort to determine the Majorana/Dirac nature of the neutrino, called CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events), is operating in the laboratory (as of 2018). The detector is shielded with lead recovered from an ancient Roman shipwreck, due to the ancient lead's lower radioactivity than recently minted lead. The artifacts were given to CUORE from the National Archaeological Museum in Cagliari.Roman ingots to shield particle detector, Nature, 15 April 2010. In September 2011, Dario Autiero of the OPERA collaboration presented findings that indicated neutrinos were arriving at OPERA about 60 ns earlier than they would if they were travelling at the speed of light. This faster-than-light neutrino anomaly was not immediately explained.Particles break light-speed limit, Nature, 22 September 2011. The results were subsequently investigated and confirmed to be wrong. They were caused by a flawed optic fiber cable in OPERA receiver of the laboratory,Neutrinos sent from CERN to Gran Sasso respect the cosmic speed limit, 8 June 2012. resulting in late arrival of the clock signal to which the neutrinos' arrivals were compared. In 2014 Borexino measured directly, for the first time, the neutrinos from the primary proton- proton fusion process in the Sun. This result is published on Nature. This measurement is consistent with the expectations derived from the standard solar model of J. Bahcall along with the theory of solar neutrino oscillations as described by MSW theory. In 2020 Borexino measured also solar neutrinos originated from CNO cycle, a fusion process common in giant stars but uncommon in the Sun (only 1% of Sun's energy output).First detection of solar neutrinos from the CNO cycle with Borexino, Indico-FNAL, , 23 June 2020.

It was pioneered at Harvard Law School by Christopher Columbus Langdell. It is based on the principle that rather than studying highly abstract summaries of legal rules (the technique used in most countries), the best way to learn American law is to read the actual judicial opinions which become the law under the rule of stare decisis (due to its Anglo-American common law origin). History and technique To set up the casebook method of law study, American law professors traditionally collect the most illustrative cases concerning a particular area of the law in special textbooks called casebooks. Some professors heavily edit cases down to the most important paragraphs, while deleting nearly all citations and paraphrasing everything else; a few present all cases in full, and most others are in between. One common technique is to provide almost all of the entire text of a landmark case which created an important legal rule, followed by brief notes summarizing the holdings of other cases which further refined the rule. Traditionally, the casebook method is coupled with the Socratic method in American law schools. For a given class, a professor will assign several cases from the casebook to read, and may also require students to be familiar with any notes following those cases. In class, the professor will ask students questions about the assigned cases to determine whether they identified and understood the correct rule from the case, if there is one‚Äîin certain heavily contested areas of the law, there will not be any one correct rule. By answering the professor's questions, \\"the student learns how to think like a lawyer.\\" A typical example in the law of contracts is Hadley v Baxendale (1854), a case that is still routinely tested on bar examinations today. Treatises designed for practicing lawyers as well as textbooks for students earning non-legal degrees (i.e., business law courses for business administration students) concisely state the famous rules announced in that case that (1) consequential damages are limited to those foreseen by the parties at the time of contracting, thus implying that (2) a party must notify the other up front of its specific needs in order to expand what is mutually foreseeable and thereby recover consequential damages if the other breaches. Thus stated, Hadley seems simple enough, but a casebook for a law school course will never say that. Rather, the law student must deduce those principles from the somewhat archaic text of the Court of Exchequer's mid-19th-century decision. This teaching method differs in two ways from the teaching methods used in most other academic programs: (1) it requires students to work almost exclusively with primary source material, which can be written in obscure or obsolete language for older cases; and (2) a typical American law school class is supposed to be a dialogue about the meaning of a case, not a straightforward lecture. In turn, this case dialogue process (by publicly exposing and examining the student's understanding of the material in the company of their peers) helps students develop the psychological toughness required of professional advocates.Wayne L. Anderson and Marilyn J. Headrick, The Legal Profession: Is it for you? (Cincinnati: Thomson Executive Press, 1996), 7. In some law schools, the casebook method is used in conjunction with lectures or other more structured forms of instruction. This is especially true in classes which are more heavily geared toward statutory law, such as tax law (which in the USA is governed by the Internal Revenue Code) and certain areas of commercial law (particularly courses dealing with the Uniform Commercial Code). This method is also used in other common law countries, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Law school outlines To facilitate the casebook method of study, \\"law school outlines\\" are used as legal topic study aids. Typically, the outlines are created by law school students; however, there are professional outlines also available. An outline typically provides a concise and direct statement of legal issues in a particular area of law, organized according to the typical law school curriculum. In some cases, outlines are organized according to specific professors or courses. Outlines often remove many legal nuances and fact specific distinctions in case law to establish more generalized legal principles. Students must remember to be cautious before relying on outlines written by others found on online databases. They frequently come with copyright notices and may often be outdated. Many such sites also warn their users that relying on these outlines alone will not be sufficient to prepare for an exam and they should only be used as a supplement to the studying process.

A spin-off in the Serious Sam series, the game has the player control Sam \\"Serious\\" Stone through confined levels‚Äîfirst in ancient Egypt, then in ancient Rome‚Äîdefeating varying enemies using an assortment of weapons. Advance was developed by Climax London, a studio of former Crawfish Interactive developers, using ray casting technology. Global Star Software announced the game in January 2004 and released it for the Game Boy Advance in April. Advance received a mixed reception, with praise for its weapons, enemies, level design and sound effects, conflicting opinions about its graphics, and criticism for its controls and frame rate issues.  Gameplay  Sam fighting two Beheaded Kamikazes with a revolver Serious Sam Advance is a first-person shooter. It contains twelve levels, each composed of enclosed rooms, often in the style of arenas. Some levels contain puzzle elements. The player, as Sam \\"Serious\\" Stone, can freely navigate each room, using the D-pad for forward and backward movement and the shoulder buttons for strafing. Enemies patrol in rooms and attack the player character on sight. Entering a room or passing a trigger causes further enemies to appear and attack. There are twenty types of enemies in total. The player can attack using ten different weapons, including ranged weapons and a chainsaw for melee. The player can aim using the D-pad and fire the weapons using the \\"A\\" button. Holding down the button causes the weapons to fire continuously. Aiming can be slowed down by holding the \\"B\\" button, while pressing the button once swaps the active weapon with another. Enemies at close range are automatically targeted. Ammunition can be collected through crates placed in levels. Advance contains no measures to save progress and uses a password system to let the player access later levels after a restart. A leaderboard documents the player's highscore, number of enemies encountered, and number of enemies killed, although that data is also not persisted. Up to four players can connect their Game Boy Advance systems using the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable and compete in a deathmatch mode.  Plot  Serious Sam Advance begins after Sam \\"Serious\\" Stone returned from a mission to 2113's Abu Simbel, Egypt. Scientists assessed the Time-Lock technology that Sam used to travel time. Initially, they could only use it to send people to and from ancient Egypt but, in 2020, became able to control the time and place of travellers' destinations. Using this feature, agents were sent to various ancient civilisations to investigate whether Mental‚Äîthe antagonist in the Serious Sam series‚Äîwas trying to release his horde on them to alter the course of history. This programme was successful for two years until three agents failed to return, as did the rescue team sent after them. Sam, the only survivor from previous encounters with Mental's forces, was thus selected to travel to the ancient Rome of 512 BCE. He initially arrives in ancient Egypt at the Temple of Herkat and fights his way through enemies sent by Mental, crossing the desert and eventually encountering and defeating the Sirian Sphinx. Sam enters a Time-Lock to return home when Mental suddenly interferes and sends Sam to ancient Rome instead. He again defeats several waves of enemies and reaches Caesar's Palace. In it, Sam eliminates the Wolfinator, marking the end of Mental's attempt to rule over ancient Rome. Wishing to take a vacation on Maui, Sam enters a nearby Time-Lock to return home.  Development and release  Serious Sam Advance was developed by Climax Group through its Climax London studio, which was composed of former developers from the defunct company Crawfish Interactive. The team employed a game engine utilising ray casting to simulate 3D computer graphics on the Game Boy Advance, a technique Crawfish had pioneered for the platform. Global Star Software, the budget-range publishing label of Take-Two Interactive, announced Advance for the Game Boy Advance in January 2004, alongside Serious Sam: Next Encounter for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. Take-Two Interactive confirmed the games anew in March. Global Star Software announced on 14 April 2004 that it had shipped both games for their respective platforms for the North American market. PAL region versions followed on 30 April 2004.  Reception  Serious Sam Advance received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", according to review aggregator website Metacritic, which calculated a normalised rating of 51/100 based on nine critic reviews. Craig Harris of IGN and Frank Provo of GameSpot observed that the game often had a low frame rate, which Harris determined caused Advance to be overly difficult. Jes Bickham, writing in NGC Magazine, commented that, due to the frame rate issues, the game was \\"slow and jittery, and ultimately workmanlike and tedious\\". Provo lauded Advances weapons, range of enemies, and level design. He stated that the music was \\"forgettable\\", while the sound effects for weapons and monsters were in good synchronicity with the gameplay. Provo considered the graphics superior to other games on Game Boy Advance, while Bob McTague (Pocket Games) described them as a \\"pixelated disaster\\". Harris, Bickham and McTague criticised the controls, of whom Harris and McTague felt they were too imprecise. Provo believed the game was too short, caused by a scarcity of levels. McTague noted that Advance was faithful to the design of the original Serious Sam games, although Harris and Provo deemed the Game Boy Advance as unfit for any first- person shooter.

Background Cornelius Olatunji Adebayo was born on February 24, 1941 in Igbaja in Kwara State. He was educated at all Saints Anglican School, Oke-Onigbin, Provincial Secondary School, Ilorin and then at Barewa College, Zaria from 1962-1963. He studied at the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria (1964‚Äì1967), and at the University of Ghana, Legon (1967‚Äì1969). He became a lecturer at the University of Ife in 1969, and in 1973 was appointed head of the English Department at Kwara State College of Technology. Between 1975 and 1978 he was Commissioner for Education and later Commissioner for Information and Economic Development in Kwara State. Early political career Kwara State in Nigeria When the reforms instituted by the military ruler Lt. Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo led to democratic elections for the second republic in 1979, Adebayo was elected as a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria running for the Unity Party of Nigeria. In 1983 he was elected governor of Kwara state, but lost the position on December 31, 1983 when the military overthrow led by Major General Muhammadu Buhari took control. In 1993 Adebayo was offered a ministerial office by the military regime of General Sani Abacha, but turned it down. After a May 31, 1995 bomb explosion in Ilorin, capital of Kwara State, the police arrested and interrogated Adebayo and other members of the National Democratic Coalition, a group that called for the return of democracy during the military regime of General Sani Abacha. In 1996, after finding he was scheduled to be arrested again, he fled the country in disguise for a brief exile in Canada. Obasanjo period In June 2003, president Obasanjo nominated Adebayo for a ministerial post. As minister of Communications, Corlenius Adebayo said his colleagues should not be carried away by fantastic returns that had been reported by the mobile phone company MTN Nigeria. He described the need to grant incentives to telecommunications service providers, and spoke with approval of plans by Multi-Links Communications Nigeria to expand its switch capacity to 500,000 lines. In September 2005 he was a keynote speaker at the 4th International Nigerian Telecommunications Summit in Abuja. Adebayo pushed for privatization of NITEL, the state telecommunications company. In September 2005 he said the sale of a controlling stake in NITEL would be completed by the end of the year. Bidders included Vodacom and MTN Group of South Africa, Huawei Technologies, Orascom Telecom of Egypt and Celtel International. In April 2006, Mtel, the Mobile subsidiary of NITEL, announced plans to add 2.5 million lines of capacity. The Board of Mtel, chaired by Cornelius Adebayo, had approved the program in September 2005. The vendors were Ericcson, Huawei, ZTE, Motorola, Nokia and Siemens. A local company founded in 2005, Transnational Corporation of Nigeria, acquired NITEL on July 3, 2006. In September 2006, Cornelius Adebayo became Minister of Works, replacing Engineer Obafemi Anibaba. Subsequent career In 2007, a Munich Court found Siemens AG guilty of misconduct and unethical contract dealings by allegedly offering bribes to Cornelius Adebayo and others to secure contracts for telecommunications equipment. According to court papers, former ministers Bello Mohammed, Tajudeen Olarenwaju, Cornelius Adebayo and Alhaji Elewi were paid over $17 million as bribes to secure contracts. In November 2007 President Umaru Yar'Adua ordered security agencies to investigate and prosecute the named officials. The Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) invited Adebayo for questioning related to involvement in the Siemens bribe scandal during his spell as communication minister.

Wynegar became the Yankees starting catcher in 1984, playing in 129 games. His average dipped to .267 in 1984, and fell further to .223 in 1985, in part due to an injury that occurred when he was hit in the head by a foul ball while standing in the on deck circle.

Baseball was popularized in Cuba by Nemesio Guillot, who founded the first major baseball club in the country. It became the most played sport in the country in the 1870s, before the period of American intervention. Despite its American origin, baseball is strongly associated with Cuban nationalism, as it effectively replaced colonial Spanish sports such as bullfighting. Since the Cuban Revolution, the league system in Cuba has been officially amateur. Top players are placed on the national team, earning stipends for training and playing in international competitions.  History   The Early years (1864‚Äì1874)  Baseball was introduced to Cuba in the 1860s by Cuban students returning from colleges in the United States and American sailors who ported in the country. The sport spread quickly across the island nation after its introduction, with student Nemesio Guillot receiving popular credit date for the game's growth in the mid-19th century. Nemesio attended Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama, with his brother Ernesto. The two returned to Cuba, and in 1868 they founded the first baseball team in Cuba, the Habana Base Ball Club. Soon after this, the first Cuban War of Independence spurred Spanish authorities in 1869 to ban the sport in Cuba. They were concerned that Cubans had begun to prefer baseball to bullfights, which Cubans were expected to dutifully attend as homage to their Spanish rulers in an informal cultural mandate. As such, baseball became symbolic of freedom and egalitarianism to the Cuban people. The ban may have also prompted Esteban Bell√°n, an early Cuban player, to remain in the United States and become the first Latin American player to appear in the major leagues. Bell√°n played baseball for the Fordham Rose Hill Baseball Club while attending Fordham University (1863‚Äì1868). After that he joined the professional Unions of Morrisania, a New York City team, followed by the Troy Haymakers. In 1871 the Haymakers joined the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, which is regarded by many historians as a major league. Bell√°n played for them in 1871 and 1872, then moved to the New York Mutuals, another N.A. team, in 1873. The first official match in Cuba took place in Pueblo Nuevo, Matanzas, at the Palmar del Junco, December 27, 1874. It was between Club Matanzas and Club Habana, the latter winning 51 to 9. Bell√°n played for Habana and hit two home runs.Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, p. 86.  Cuban baseball is organized (1878‚Äì1898)  In late 1878 the Cuban League was founded. At its inception the league consisted of three teams: Almendares, Havana, and Matanzas. Every team played the other two teams four times each. The first game was played on December 29, 1878, with Havana defeating Almendares 21 to 20. Havana, under team captain Bell√°n, went undefeated in the inaugural season and won the championship. The teams were composed amateurs and were all-white, however professionalism gradually took hold as teams bid on players to pry them from their rivals.  Cuban baseball becomes international (1898‚Äì1933)  The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War brought increased opportunities to play against top teams from the United States. Also, the Cuban League admitted black players beginning in 1900. Soon many of the best players from the Northern American Negro Leagues were playing on integrated teams in Cuba. Beginning in 1908, Cuban teams scored a number of successes in competition against major league baseball teams, behind outstanding players such as pitcher Jos√© M√©ndez and outfielder Crist√≥bal Torriente (who were both enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006). By the 1920s, the level of play in the Cuban League was superb, as Negro League stars like Oscar Charleston and John Henry Lloyd spent their winters playing in Cuba. In 1899, the All Cubans, consisting of Cuban League professional players, were the first Latin American team to tour the United States. The team returned in 1902‚Äì05, exposing white Cuban players to U.S. major league and minor league scouts, and introducing black Cuban players to competition against the Negro leagues. Later Negro league teams included the Cuban Stars and the New York Cubans, which were stocked mostly with Cuban or other Latin American players.  Amateur baseball in Cuba (1933‚Äì1960)  Amateur baseball in Cuba was thriving in the 1940s and deepened the organization and maturity of the league. There were several amateur leagues in Cuba. Many of the leagues were composed of factory or businesses workers who represented their individual companies. Main sources of talent for Cuban baseball teams were from sugarmill baseball, semi-professional teams, and the amateur leagues. Original amateur teams represented exclusive social clubs in the Havana area, such as the Velado Tennis club.Gonzalez, R. ‚ÄúThe Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball,‚Äù189. The term ‚Äúamateur baseball‚Äù is defined as ‚Äúspecifically the game played by social clubs who played in the Amateur league.‚Äù Cubans refer to this league as los amateurs. The growth of amateur baseball can be attributed to the economic recovery in Cuba around 1934.Gonzalez, R. ‚ÄúThe Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball,‚Äù225. In 1934 there were only six teams but by 1940 that grew to eighteen.Gonzalez, R. ‚ÄúThe Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball,‚Äù225 In 1954 amateur Dominican baseball became better organized, respected abroad, and very structured which led professional clubs to draw young talent from the ingenious leagues in cities throughout Cuba. Leagues which talented players were recruited from consisted of clever and unique ball players. The removal of some of the talented players in the league only slightly impacted the amateur leagues in Cuban cities. The young and talented team players who remained in the leagues gained physical strength by participating in the amateur games. Amateur leagues were the heart and soul of Cuban baseball. The desire to throw, catch and hit a baseball was ingrained in young Cuban Amateur players. The leagues in Cuba participated in several championship tournaments. Cuban males were inclined to participate in the amateur leagues because they were an outlet from the everyday stresses they experienced in both work and family life. The passion of amateur play was not controlled by money or international recognition. One major form of amateur baseball in Cuba was sugarmill baseball. Sugarmill baseball was popularized in the early 1950s.Gonzalez, R. ‚ÄúThe Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball,‚Äù191 This group of amateurs consisted mainly of players who were originally workers at the sugarmill. It was often loosely organized and regionally established. Each team represented a different sugarmill and they would compete against one another. Games were generally played on Sunday and holidays in order to leave weekdays reserved for field work.Klein, M. ‚ÄúSugarball: The American Game, the Dominican Dream,‚Äù23 Players in the league used sugarmill ball as an escape from the harsh working conditions of the mill. During the Golden Age of Cuban League sugarmill baseball was one of the most important producers of talent. In Cuba‚Äôs amateur baseball leagues some of the greatest moments and players the game has ever produced on the island can be found, along with a high level of unconcealed iniquity. Until 1959 blacks were excluded from the amateur leagues.Gonzalez, R. ‚ÄúThe Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball,‚Äù190. Segregation is traced back to the start of the 20th century when disagreement among players regarding the professionalization of the game led to a split. The amateur game was the origin of the segregation and remained a sport played among exclusive social clubs and factory workers.Gonzalez, R. ‚ÄúThe Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball,‚Äù191. Membership in these clubs were restricted to whites, therefore blacks were excluded from amateur baseball and had to play for the semiprofessional teams. Whether the whites only policy was a direct consequence of American influence on upper-class Cubans or was a retention from colonial times is difficult to determine. The growth of education in Cuba led to the decline of amateur baseball. As the players became more educated, they attempted to bypass the amateur level of ball and head straight for the Professional leagues. The amateur leagues did not provide players with a large financial income. As players became more aware of the opportunities of the Professional leagues they aspired to gain recognition as ball players and join the Professional leagues. Opportunities the Professional leagues offered players gave them the option of playing for US teams and making more money. In Amateur baseball fields the home plates are made of wood. The fields are not in very good shape. The grandstands present at amateur baseball fields are protected by chicken wire and rarely painted. The maximum occupancy for a grandstand is 300 fans. Generally the stands are full and often fans will stand on the sidelines to watch the games. The stands at amateur games are filled with cane cutters and factory workers looking to enjoy life after a hard day's work in the fields. On the field the Cuban game has a few quirks (aluminum bats are allowed, and the umpire puts strikes before balls when he gives the count), but it closely resembles American baseball in both style and level of accomplishment. Today amateur baseball remains an outlet from a hard day's work in the fields and is still played by cane workers. In 1960s the government abolished all professional sports on the island.Jamail, H. \\"Full Count: Inside Cuban Baseball,\\"29. Sports were viewed as opposing the principles of the Revolution. With this thought in mind the ideas of sport were altered to better coincide with the ideology of the Revolution. To reshape baseball was a difficult task the idea of tradition had to be demolished and rebuilt. Rewriting Cuban baseball history by connecting the president to the glory years of the Amateur Leagues began to take shape and reflect revolutionary ideas. From then on baseball and sports in Cuba were meant to encourage cooperation among nations, represent national pride, and promote fitness and military preparedness.Pettavino, P. ‚ÄúThe Cuba Reader: History, Culture, Politics,‚Äù475. Through sports Cubans were able to feel personally involved in the nation building, socialization, and political integration of the revolution. Fidel Castro said, ‚ÄúWe can say that our athletes are the children of our Revolution and, at the same time, the standard-bearers of that same Revolution.‚ÄùGonzalez, R. ‚ÄúThe Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball,‚Äù368. In 1960, after the abolishment of all professional sports fans shifted their focus to the amateur leagues. In the 1960s once amateur baseball became the main focus there was a strong desire to play and participate in sports. Cuban baseball shed its commercial skin and sought out to advance the social and political aims of the revolution via sport. The organization of the game and role baseball led in society was transformed. Changes were revolutionary and discrimination in amateur baseball was abolished. The reorganization of baseball after 1961, the durability and expansion of the structure of baseball, construction of new stadiums, and the production of players are all significant results the Revolution had on Cuban sports.Gonzalez, R. ‚ÄúThe Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball,‚Äù367. The island has remained the powerhouse of world amateur baseball since then.  Baseball in post-revolutionary Cuba (1961‚Äìpresent)  In 1959 the Cuban Revolution ushered in fundamental changes in how Cuban baseball was organized. The revolutionary government made baseball a symbol of excellence and used it to encourage nationalism.Dierker, Larry. ‚ÄúForeword,‚Äù Full Count Inside Cuban Baseball. Southern Illinois University, 2000. Print. xii, xiii. Shortly after the revolution, victorious guerrilla leaders demonstrated their Cuban spirit by engaging in exhibition baseball games that included symbolic gestures reinforcing the notion that baseball would be an integral component of post- revolution Cuba.Carter, Thomas F. ‚ÄúNew Rules to the Old Game: Cuban Sport and State Legitimacy in the Post Soviet Era.‚Äù Identitites 15.2 (2008): 200. In 1961, the Cuban government replaced the former professional baseball system with new amateur baseball leagues, most prominent among them the Cuban National Series. The reorganization aimed to organize the sport based on a socialist model of sports driven by national ideals rather than money.Baird, K.E. (2005). ‚ÄúCuban baseball: Ideology, politics, and market forces.‚Äù Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 29(2), 169. Revolutionary officials believed that under capitalism sport is corrupted by the profit motive. The perversion of sport was believed to result in the exploitation of the masses.Pye, Geralyn. (1986). ‚ÄúThe Ideology of Cuban Sport.‚Äù Journal of Sport History, 13(2). 125. Fidel Castro with Camilo Cienfuegos The shift from a professional to amateur system was preceded by the introduction of the Institute for Sports, Physical Education and Recreation (INDER).Pettavino, Paula. ‚ÄúCuban Sports Saved by Capitalism?‚Äù Report on Sport and Society, 37(5), 28. The Cuban government made success in sports competitions a primary goal in the hopes that international sports triumphs could draw positive attention to the Cuban Revolution. In addition to displaying Cuba‚Äôs leadership to Third World countries, this would give Cubans themselves a sense of pride and feelings of nationalism for the Revolution. It was seen as a way of enhancing the revolutionary government‚Äôs legitimacy.Paula Pettavino & Philip Brenner. ‚ÄúThe Role of Sports in Cuba‚Äôs Domestic and International Policy.‚Äù Cuba Briefing Paper, 21(4), 2. Sports participation in Cuba was also universalized and thus made an essential component of revolutionary activity. The term coined to describe such a process was Masividad, and sports served the purpose to not only educate and train the Cuban people, but also to allow them yet another opportunity to fit in an egalitarian society that conformed to the very principles of the revolution. The Cuban people also became healthier due to their participation in sporting related activities, especially those that promoted physical education. Most Cuban sports facilities and the equipment they possess are adequate and meet the needs of the people as thoroughly as possible. INDER has branches at the municipal, provincial and community level and is ultimately responsible for the delivery of all sport and physical education functions; and the coordination of all sport related systems, structures and services delivered by political, health, cultural, community development, education and sports agencies and institutions that traditionally function independently of each other.Human Resource Development. ‚ÄúSecond Meeting of the Human Resource Development (HRD) in Sport Committee.‚Äù Report, 19‚Äì23 March 2003, 5. Although sport in general underwent a huge transformation after the revolution, it is still imperative to note that baseball continued to play a pivot role. After all it was Cuba‚Äôs bloodline and was easy to pick up and play since it required less conditioning and more focus on the crafting skills of hitting, pitching, and strategy.Wysocki, David. ‚ÄúFidel Castro‚Äôs Game: Baseball and Cuban Nationalism.‚Äù The Chico Historian 19(2009), 147. Sports other than baseball retain some popularity in Cuba, including boxing and soccer, and the government continues to consider an athlete in fulfillment his or her duty as a Cuban citizen regardless of the sport pursued.Paula Pettavino & Geralyn Pye. ‚ÄúRevolutionary Sport.‚Äù The Cuba Reader. Ed. Avita Chomsky, Barry Carr, & Pamela Maria Smorkaloff. Duke University Press. London, 2003. Print, 475. As mentioned earlier, sport in post-revolutionary Cuba was utilized to not only improve health, but in doing so citizens have become more prepared in-terms of self-defense in light of hostile policies at least in the early days of the revolution by the United States. Baseball, like all other sports in Cuba was also utilized for political ends. For instance, Cuba has allowed for the Cuban National Baseball team to play in countries abroad such as Nicaragua to benefit flood victims and in Japan as a symbolic gesture to express goodwill for a strong trading partner.Brown, Bruce. ‚ÄúCuban Baseball.‚Äù The Atlantic Monthly, 253(6), 109. Such assistance by Cuba underlies its commitment to socialist internationalism, which still to this day sees a bevy of Cuban sports specialists training and instructing abroad citizens of other nations.Paula Pettavino & Geralyn Pye. ‚ÄúRevolutionary Sport.‚Äù The Cuba Reader. Ed. Avita Chomsky, Barry Carr, & Pamela Maria Smorkaloff. Duke University Press. London, 2003. Print, 479. Everything has seemingly been positive, however not everything went as planned. Since the professional system was abolished in-favor of amateur leagues, players were not paid as extravagantly as they once were. One report found that most baseball stars made less than $2,000 annually and that all players would receive sports leave pay at the same rate they would get from their off-season jobs as professionals, sports coaches, craftsmen, etc. The situation would get worse in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, which was Cuba‚Äôs main trading partner. This led many players to defect to the United States due to deteriorating economic conditions. Amidst such action, even Fidel Castro admitted himself that it's hard to prevent the baseball stars from defecting. He would later proclaim, ‚Äúif you have to compete against six million dollars versus three thousand Cuban pesos you cannot win.‚ÄùSteve Fainaru & Ray Sanchez. ‚ÄúEmigration in the Special Period.‚Äù The Cuba Reader. Ed. Avita Chomsky, Barry Carr, & Pamela Maria Smorkaloff. Duke University Press. London, 2003. Print, 639. Other problems included bribery scandals in which coaches and player alike would fix games, which subsequently led to them being banned from baseball in Cuba.Brown, Bruce. ‚ÄúCuban Baseball.‚Äù The Atlantic Monthly, 253(6), 113. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there were also instances in Cuba where baseball games would be canceled due to power outages and most people chose to watch games from their home since it seemed more feasible to do so. The situation was so bad that pitchers in-game, would often have to exchange cleats with the pitcher who would have to pitch in the next half- inning. Resources even as minute as baseball cleats were scarce during this very time. The Cuban government to this very day is also somewhat hostile in relation to the players that did defect in the 1990s.  Resumed exhibitions (1999‚Äìpresent)  In 1999, the Cuban national baseball team played a two- game exhibition series against the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball. This marked the first time the Cuban national team played against an MLB team, and the first time an MLB team played in Cuba since 1959. The Orioles won the first game, which was held in Havana, while the Cuban national team won the second game, which was held in Baltimore. In December 2014, the United States and Cuba began to reestablish diplomatic relations. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred entered into discussions to hold an exhibition game between an MLB team and the Cuban national team in 2016.The Tampa Bay Rays played the Cuban national baseball team on March 22, 2016 in Havana's Estadio Latinoamericano. The Tampa Bay Rays defeated the Cuban national baseball team by a score of 4 to 1. The game was attended by U.S. President Barack Obama, Cuban President Raul Castro and Rachel Robinson, the widow of Jackie Robinson. In January 2019, Matthew McLaughlin became the first American to play in Cuba's National baseball system in over 60 years.  Bibliography  * Bjarkman, Peter C.

Swimming career Gurr competed in the backstroke and freestyle events at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. There she won the bronze medal in the 200-metre backstroke. In 1976, she was made a Member of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest achievement award, in a ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa. She was inducted into the BC Sports Hall of Fame in 1987, the BC Swimming Hall of Fame in 2004, and the Canadian Aquatic Hall of Fame. Gurr started swimming at the newly built Arbutus Club in Vancouver in 1965, and later joined the Canadian Dolphin Swim Club, where her idol Elaine Tanner swam and was coached by Howard Firby. She qualified for her first Senior Nationals at age 12, placing 12th in one event. At the age of 13 she narrowly missed a berth on the 1968 Olympic team by placing 3rd in the 200-metre backstroke, at the Olympic Trials, and missing the qualifying time by only 3 tenths of a second. During the summer of 1969, aged 14, the Canadian Dolphins went on their first trip to Europe, where they attended the ASA British Championships in Blackpool. She won five gold medals, swimming in both the junior and senior events, with the significant prize of winning the senior 100 metres backstroke and 200 metres backstroke titles. Next they attended the Canadian Nationals in Montreal, where she won her first National titles in the 100M and 200-metre backstroke, and came away with 4 gold and one silver medal. The team went on to the first Canada Games in Halifax where she won 5 gold medals. She was National Champion in the 100 and 200-metre backstroke from 1969-1972. During her career, Gurr had many health problems and injuries. After the very successful summer of 1969, she began to experience pain in her left knee. X-rays showed a problem, Osteochondritis dissecans of the left femoral condyle, in which a part of the bone, was becoming detached from the femur. It was determined by her orthopedic surgeon Dr. Hector Gillespie, and her GP, sports medicine expert Dr. Doug Clement that surgery was needed to pin the loosened piece of bone in place. In December 1969 she entered the hospital for the surgery. Much to her surprise, when wheeled into the operating room, she was told of a change of plans. Due to her young age, it was hoped that with crutches and a specialized cast, from hip to ankle, the knee would heal on its own. The cast was made from heated and molded foam rubber, and secured by fiberglass dipped in acetone, and wrapped around the inner foam layer. When it dried, it weighed almost nothing, and she could continue her training. This was the prototype for the lightweight fiberglass casts used by many people today. Gurr began training, virtually only being able to use one leg while swimming and doing the turns at each end of the pool, and using the crutches at all times, with no weight bearing on that leg. Not missing months of training was very important at this time, as her first International Games, the Commonwealth Games, were coming up in the summer of 1970. The cast was removed twice, once to qualify for the Games trials, and then again for the Commonwealth Trials in Edmonton. She finished first at the trials, despite swimming with the use of only one leg and made the team in the 100 and 200-metre backstroke. Crutches were used at all times while walking. The cast came off for good in May 1970, and the knee was deemed healed. It took quite a while to get the knee and leg working again properly after 6 months of the cast and crutches, but two months later Gurr won three medals at the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. It was quite a remarkable accomplishment. She won a silver medal in the 200-metre backstroke, and a bronze in the 100-metre backstroke and another bronze in the 4x100-metre medley relay in Edinburgh at the Commonwealth Games of 1970 at age 15. She was awarded the BC Junior Athlete of the Year in 1970. In 1971, at 16 years old, Gurr won 3 gold and one silver medal at the Pan-American Games in Cali, Colombia. The gold medals were in the Women's 4x100M Medley Relay, and the 100 and 200M Backstroke events. The silver medal was in the 4x100M Freestyle Relay. During the final of the 200M Backstroke, at about the 75M mark, all the power in the area went out. As it was an outdoor pool, at night, this caused the race to come to an abrupt halt. Who knows what the outcome would have been had the race continued, but it was decided by the coaches and swimmers to re-swim the final after the other races that night. And Gurr did win on the second try. By the time of the 1972 Olympic Trials and Games, Gurr was having trouble with a spinal problem, aggravated by all the training, and tendonitis in both shoulders. Cortisone shots were given at some points so she could continue training and competing leading up to Munich. At 17 was the bronze medal in the 200-metre backstroke in Munich, while at the Olympic Trials that year, she broke Elaine Tanner's Canadian record in the 100-metre backstroke, she had broken the 200-metre record earlier. She barely made it into the final of the 200-metre backstroke, qualifying 8th and swimming the race in lane 8, which is considered the worst lane and the battle for the bronze medal was very close among several of the swimmers. She missed making the final of the 100-metre backstroke by 3/100ths of a second, a disappointing result. But she was happy to win the bronze in the 200-metre, on the last night of the swimming competition. At 18, in 1973, Gurr competed in the first World Aquatic Championships in Belgrade, and at 19, in 1974, she went to her second Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand and won a silver and bronze medal. These were in the 100 and 200-metre backstroke events. She held numerous Canadian records in age group swimming and the senior events, as an individual and as a member of many relay teams, for the Canadian Dolphins and while representing Canada internationally. Although being an excellent individual medley swimmer (200 metre), after the cast came off her knee, she had trouble doing the dolphin kick properly, and afterwards could not swim butterfly or medley events. After the Christchurch Commonwealth Games, Gurr took a long break from swimming, and did compete again during the summer of 1976. She competed at the Santa Clara International Meet and in the 1976 Olympic Trials, but did not qualify for the team. She then retired from the sport. During her career Gurr traveled extensively, all over Canada and the United States, competing at the Santa Clara International Meet every summer. She traveled to England numerous times, attending the Coca- Cola International Meet in London in the spring, for several years, and on other occasions as well. She traveled to Scotland, Holland, Germany twice, Switzerland, Norway, France, Austria and the former Yugoslavia. She also visited New Zealand twice, Australia once, where she met Dawn Fraser, a swimming icon, at the New South Wales Championships in January 1972. She also went to Hawaii, Fiji, and Cali, Colombia in 1971 for the Pan-Am Games. Awards Gurr was chosen as one of the recipients of the Queen Elizabeth ll Diamond Jubilee Medal, which will be awarded at a special presentation ceremony in April 2012. The medals will be presented by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia. On April 5, 2013 at the World Championship Trials in Victoria, British Columbia, Gurr was inducted into Swimming Canada's \\"Circle of Excellence\\". The presentation was made before the start of the finals and she was accompanied by her coach Deryk Snelling and teammate Leslie Cliff, who are also Circle of Excellence members. Personal life Gurr's coach for the majority of her career was Deryk Snelling, who many believe was the reason the Canadian Dolphin Team were National Team champions for so many years. Almost half of the Munich Olympic swim team were from the Canadian Dolphins, and the medals won by Leslie Cliff, Bruce Robertson, Bill Mahoney and Gurr accounted for almost all the medals won in Munich, including all sports. Gurr presently lives and works in Vancouver.

It no longer exists. History Oregon Geographic Names says that the William W. Mitchell Company started the town in 1919 and named it as a portmanteau of Valley and Siletz Railroad, whose terminus was at that location. Company town researcher Linda Carlson says the town was founded by the Cobbs & Mitchell company of Cadillac, Michigan during World War I.1988 Polk County Itemizer-Observer article cited in Valsetz post office was established in 1920. In 1947, Cobbs & Mitchell sold the town to its sales agent, Herbert Templeton. He operated it as the Valsetz Lumber Company until 1959, when its sawmill and timber stands were sold to the Boise Cascade Corporation. After the depletion of the old growth timber in the area in the 1970s, the railroad was torn up. In 1983, Boise Cascade announced that all operations at Valsetz would end early the next year. At that time, the town's population was about 300. In 1984, the town and most of its structures were removed, as everything in the community, property and streets included, was owned by the corporation. The post office closed the same year. The site became part of the Valsetz Tree Farm. Valsetz Lake, an artificial lake next to the townsite that was formed by damming the South Fork Siletz River, was drained in 1988. Legacy Former residents of Valsetz gather for an annual reunion in Falls City, which is the site of a Valsetz memorial. The place was nationally known for its record rainfalls and for its newspaper, the Valsetz Star, which was started in the 1930s by 9-year-old Dorothy Anne Hobson. At one time the population of Valsetz was over one thousand, and served by its own elementary and high school, which fielded championship basketball teams. Near the site of the former community is the \\"Valley of the Giants\\", of Bureau of Land Management-protected old growth Douglas-fir and Western Hemlock forest on the North Fork of the Siletz River. The valley was set aside for protection in 1976. The Valsetz Dining Hall at Western Oregon University (WOU) in Monmouth, east of Valsetz, was built in 1970 and rededicated in 1991 in tribute to the former community. Between 1926 and 1931, WOU, then known as the Oregon Normal School, sent 16 to 20 student teachers for six-week sessions in the Valsetz elementary school.

Demographics Moranhat is a town located in the eastern part of Assam or Upper Assam. It derives its name from the Moran community (an indigenous Assamese community) . The town is surrounded by tea gardens, oil fields, and villages. India census, Moranhat had a population of 5779. Males constitute 55% of the population and females 45%. Moranhat has an average literacy rate of 78%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 80%, and female literacy is 77%. Eleven per cent of the population in Moranhat is under 6 years of age. Predominantly indigenous Assamese communities are present in the area, the town also comprises immigrant Muslims, Jains, Christians constitute the remaining population. Immigrant Bengalis, Christians, Sikh, Bhojpuris, and Tamilians‚Äîwho mostly come here on teaching assignments at the convent schools‚Äîare some of the major communities residing in this town. The primary occupation of the inhabitants of this town is teaching. Farming and small-scale businesses are also two of the important earning avenues for the people. Assamese is the main indigenous language spoken in Moranhat, followed by immigrant languages like Bengali, Hindi, Bhojpuri, and Punjabi spoken by immigrants. A unique geographical feature of Moranhat is its location between two districts‚Äî Charaideo (bifurcated from Sivasagar district) and Dibrugarh. The National Highway-37 passes through the heart of Moranhat. The National Highway acts as the divider, where one side falls under the jurisdiction of Charaideo district and the other under the Dibrugarh district. Education On the education front, there are several Assamese and English medium convent schools as well as a large number of vernacular schools. The most popular school of the best reputation is The St Joseph's High School. The Moran Higher Secondary School is one of the major institutes in Moran boosting education in this locality.

Precise methods and definitions vary with country, bidding system and partnership agreements. Definitions Standard American In Standard American a reverse is defined by William S. RootThe ABCs of Bridge William S. Root. 1998 Three Rivers Press. as \\"... a nonjump bid at the two-level in a new suit that ranks higher than the suit you bid first\\", and by Bridge World. as \\"a non-jump bid in a new suit that bypasses a bid in a lower-ranking suit already bid by the same player\\". Acol The Acol definition is somewhat wider and includes any bid of a new suit by opener higher than two of their first suit.Really Easy Bidding 1998 EBU Examples An example satisfying both definitions is: :1 ‚Äì 1; 2 The last bid is a reverse. Note responder avoided making an initial response of 1. Despite this, opener chose to bid 2, apparently seeking a fit that is unlikely to exist. This seemingly odd bidding is the \\"reverse\\" of what one would expect with a minimum hand (keeping the bidding low) and is used only with strong hands as it consumes bidding space. A relatively easy way to identify the reverse uses the \\"gap\\" principle. A simple reverse is made when: 1\\\\. Opener opens one of any suit (except spades). 2\\\\. Responder bids at the one level. 3\\\\. Responder's bid leaves a \\"gap\\" between the two bids. 4\\\\. Opener then bids \\"into the gap\\" at the two level. For example, in the example above, the response created a \\"gap\\" of the red suits. When opener bids a red suit that was \\"in the gap\\" then that constitutes a reverse. Opener's reverse Depending on the bidding system, a reverse by opener usually shows a minimum of 16 points or a five-loser hand and at least five cards in the first bid suit. Opener's reverse may face a weak responding hand with which responder may have intended (over a simple suit rebid) to rebid his own suit or taken a preference to opener's first suit at the two level. Opener's reverse still allows responder to rebid his suit at the two level, but a preference to opener's first suit must be at the three level. Thus, opener's reverse must show values at least one trick beyond the minimum needed to open. For example, following 1 ‚Äì 1 ; 2 ‚Äì ?, responder may have a weak hand such as QJ86 K2 8762 Q74 and be planning to rebid 2, a simple preference, if opener made a typical rebid such as 1NT or 2, and to pass if opener rebid 2 or 2. However, following the reverse, he must now rebid 3. Thus the reverse has forced the partnership to commit to taking nine tricks instead of eight - based on the extra strength of opener. Examples of reverse bidding sequences: *1(by opener) ‚Äì 1(by responder); 2(by opener - this bid is the \\"reverse\\") *1 ‚Äì 1; 2 *1 ‚Äì 1NT; 2 *1 ‚Äì 2; 3 Acol definition only *1 ‚Äì 2; 3 Acol definition only A special case exists when responder makes a two-over-one initial bid. Since a two-over-one response shows more than a minimum, generally ten or more, opener does not need as strong a hand to reverse the bidding at that juncture. The modern trend is therefore to allow such a reverse bid after a two-over-one initial response with a minimum opening hand.Root, William S. (1986). \\"Commonsense Bidding\\", p.48. Three Rivers Press, New York. Opener's reverse need not be in a four-card or longer suit; it can be made on a powerful three-card minor suit, such as AQJ. This approach is useful in investigating notrump contracts and when no other four-card suit is available to bid. High and low level reverse Reverse bids are generally considered to be forcing, with subtle variations depending on system: *A standard reverse (called a low level reverse in the UK), when opener's second bid is in a new higher ranked suit at the two level, is forcing for one round only, if it follows a one level bid by responder *A standard reverse following a two level bid by responder is unlikely to be passed before a game contract is reached, due to the additional points needed for the response *Under 2/1 game forcing any rebid by opener following a two level response, which is itself forcing to game, cannot be passed until game is reached *A high level reverse (a term used in the UK and in Acol), when opener's second bid is in a new lower ranked suit at the three level, is forcing to game. *Strong club systems such as Precision Club have much less need for reverse bids to show extra strength because natural suit bids are limited. In that context, a reverse generally shows playing strength rather than high cards. These examples illustrate high and low level reverses: *1 ‚Äì 1; 2 : a standard reverse(or low reverse) by opener - the 2 bid is forcing for one round *1 ‚Äì 2; 3 : a high reverse by opener - the 3 bid is forcing to game In some variants of 2/1 game forcing, the major-suit reverse after the sequence 1 ‚Äì 2 doesn't promise extra values ‚Äî opener may merely show a 4-card suit or a stopper. Kaplan‚ÄìSheinwold treats 1 ‚Äì 1M; 2 as a reverse although this is not standard in other systems. Later bidding Most partnerships play a rebid of responder's suit or of 2NT in response to opener's reverse as weak and other responses as forcing to game, including preference for the opening suit. Thus, after :1 ‚Äì 1; 2 ‚Äì ? responder's rebids are: :::2: weak, five card or longer heart suit :::2: strong relay (Fourth suit forcing) :::2NT: weak relay :::3: forcing preference, three card or longer support for opener's clubs Responder's reverse Most standard methods treat a responder's reverse as a game force. Responder's reverse usually follows a same suit rebid or a notrump rebid by opener, because otherwise it would be treated as conventional. Typical responder's reverse sequences are: :1 ‚Äì 1; 1NT ‚Äì 2 :1 ‚Äì 1; 2 ‚Äì 2 Jump reverses The term \\"jump reverse\\" denotes a jump bid in a suit in which a non-jump bid would be a reverse. Jump reverses after a major-suit response carry a special meaning. Most expert partnerships utilise this bid to denote game-going values with shortness (often specifically a singleton) in the suit bid and support for partner's major suit. An example of a jump reverse is: 1 ‚Äì 1; 3 Partnerships utilising this agreement commonly agree that in this situation a splinter bid (i.e. a double jump in a new suit) indicates a void.William S. Root and Richard Pavlicek, Modern Bridge Conventions. This is also the understanding used in Bridge World Standard, though other options may also be used. Jump reverses after a minor-suit response commonly show splinter raises, too. 1 ‚Äì 2; 3 Jump reverses after a 1NT response to a minor opening are often used to indicate game-going values with shortness in the suit bid (a singleton or void) and six cards or more in the minor suit opened. This agreement facilitates partner in deciding the final contract (in most cases 3NT or a game or slam in the opened minor).

Its latitude and longitude are 48¬∞02'59\\"N, 53¬∞37'59\\"W. right Southport had a very small population of 95 in 2001. The population has dropped a lot since the early 1990s because a lot of families have moved away to find work. Southport currently has no businesses, the only store, Avery's Grocery, closed in 2001 due to poor business. This snug harbour (one of the most photographed in the province) attracted early settlement because of its location near fishing grounds around West Random Head and the entrance to Southwest Arm. It was an early haven for sailing ships entering and leaving Random Sound and became an important mercantile centre for the region in the post 1885 period. The 1753 Census of Trinity Bay indicated five households on Fox [Harbour] Island and another three in \\"Harts Eas\\". Note: The Fox Island identified in the 1753 Trinity Bay census is the Fox Island at Champney's West, Trinity Bay not Fox Harbour Island at Southport, Trinity Bay. (L.J. Dean, August) 2020). Southport was originally known as Fox Harbour up until 1916. It was changed as a result of a petition led by local merchant John Vey. The community was tired of having its mail go astray, there being, at least two other Fox Harbours in Newfoundland. History The harbour was used as an alternative anchorage by 17th century English ships fishing out of the historic migratory fishing station at nearby Heart's Ease Beach. Heart's Ease Beach was settled permanently circa 1750-1753 by the John and Grace Baker family of Trinity. Their grandson, Thomas Baker, who was born at Heart's Ease Beach in 1794 of John Baker (Jr) and James Dean who was born at Old Perlican in 1802 of James Dean were the first permanent settlers at Fox Harbour (renamed Southport in 1914) circa 1832. These two individuals and their families comprised the community's a total population of 11 as recorded in the 1836 Trinity Bay census. Descendents of Thomas Baker and his wife Eleanor resided at Southport until circa 1900 before moving to Random Island and Clarenville. In the 1835-1850 period other early permanent residents included John and James Lambert of Old Perlican/Trinity ancestry and Joseph Martin, Richard Burridge, and James Avery of Grates Cove as well as temporary residents Phillip King and Thomas Smith of Hant's Harbour. Some of these families may likely have begun winter woods work in the Southwest Arm area before the 1830s. By the mid 1850's these early families were joined by another Thomas Smith from Conception Bay via Chance Cove, Trinity Bay; William Wells from English Harbour, T.Bay; Philip White from New Perlican; Susannah (widow of Thomas) Pond and sons William,James, and Robert of Salmon Cove (Champneys), T.Bay; and temporary residents Thomas Pelley of Hants Harbour and James Brown of Spaniard's Bay, Conception Bay ancestry. Other surnames of Southport by 1900 included Alcock, Balsom, Button, Bursey, Ivany, Hiscock, Langer, Miller, and Seaward. The 1845 Census shows a population of 38, increasing to 102 by 1857 (but this figure likely includes Gooseberry Cove). Southport and Gooseberry Cove, separated by a mile wide neck of land , shared schools and churches in their early settlement period. The first Church of England school/chapel was erected at Heart's Ease Beach in 1859 and was replaced by a new church and school at the \\"Crossroads\\" at Gooseberry Cove in 1880. The first Methodist Church in the Random region was built at Fox Harbour (Southport) in the 1855-1860 period. James Dean (1802-1865) was the first Methodist lay reader at Southport and elsewhere in the Random area while George Vardy (1818-1882) who settled at Clay Pitts in 1854 from Grates Cove and Burton Green in Hampshire, England was the first Church of England layreader and teacher to serve Southport and its nearby communities. In 1874 a Methodist school was first established at Southport in the Methodist Church and in succeeding years the communities shared each other's schools when teacher placements were problematic. The early settlers were inshore fishing families, but the community also became involved in the Labrador fishery in the 1870s. Early residents traded most catches with merchants in Trinity and visiting trading schooners. By 1890 Henry Alcock of Harbour Grace had established a mercantile business at Southport and nearby Hickman's Harbour had become a local mercantile centre as well. Over the 1880-1895 period Captain Edmund Seaward of Gooseberry Cove operated at least one banking schooner and several Labrador schooners from Southport as did Richard (Dickie) Seward. Over the 1900-1925 period several small merchants (Arthur Adey, John Vey, and Mary Smith) operated retail and fishery related businesses at Southport. In the post 1925 period they were succeeded by Edmund Vardy of Hickman's Harbour and local merchants Kenneth Smith and Nelson Avery who both operated relatively large retail/fishery related businesses until the early 1960's. Kenneth Smith had several Labrador and coasting schooners built in the community, with the Lamberts being the best known shipwrights. Several families also continued the tradition of wintering in tilts at a variety of sites in Southwest Arm and Random Sound into the 1940,s. Pit saws were widely used in the community to saw lumber and ship's planking. The Pond family in conjunction with the Blundon family of Hickman's Harbour operated a watermill on the Sand Bank at Southport driven by a brook from Muddy (Lambert's) Pond and the family of George Lambert of Southport operated a watermill at Deer Cove on Random Island, the site of the family winter home. Kenneth Smith operated a stationery sawmill and cooperage mill on Fox Harbour Island (where the Pond family were resident until the late 19th century) and several other residents also made fish casks and engaged in the production of birch hoops. By 1956, when Southport received its first road connection with the Province's highway system, the population of the community had peaked at approximately 225. By this time, however, the Labrador fishery had died and most fishing was carried out in local waters for cod, turbot, mackerel, herring, capelin and lobster. All cod landings were salted and dried on community flakes for marketing before the mid-1950's at which time fishermen increasingly began selling their catches fresh to local merchants and outside buyers. By this date Southport had become one of the principal centres in Newfoundland for the production of salted or pickled turbot and was a significant mackerel bar seine fishing centre with much of the pickled mackerel product being sold to West Indian markets. Its large output of pickled turbot was sold primarily in the lumber camps of Newfoundland, the Maritimes, Quebec and Maine. In the early 1960's a number of Southport fishermen were amongst the pioneers in the expansion of the groundfish longliner/gillnetter vessel fishery and constructed their own 45'vessels at Southport and also helped pioneer the development of the groundfish gillnet and purse seine pelagic fishery along the province's east/northeast coast for species such as cod, turbot, flounder, capelin, herrring and mackerel. By 1992, when the northern cod moratorium was implemented, larger vessels dominated the Southport fishing industry but smaller inshore vessels were still being deployed by some fishing crews. Several of these larger vessels were also venturing as far as the Grand Banks for cod, crab and tuna in the post 1985 period. In the post 1970 period Southport Fish Products and Clarenville Ocean Products operated a multi- species processing/buying facility in the community. Early in the 20th century, with the establishment of the Grand Falls pulp and paper mill Southport fishermen, drew upon this tradition of woods work to find seasonal employment cutting pulpwood. As the Labrador fishery declined and the community's population increased the tradition of working away from the community for much of the year continued, with an emphasis on woods work and general construction labour. From the 1950's onwards, increasing numbers left the fishery altogether, finding wage labour at Labrador and Labrador construction sites such as Goose Bay, Labrador City, Churchill Falls and Come by Chance. Beginning in the early 1960s an increasing number of the community's younger residents moved to Ontario seeking employment. A number of families moved to the Clarenville area which had an increasing role after 1960 as a regional service centre as highways were upgraded. Improved roads also made it possible for students from Southport to be bused to a nearby integrated central school at Little Heart's Ease. After 1970 a number of Southport families erected homes on the road between Southport and Gooseberry Cove. As of 2020, there are less than 50 permanent residents in the community and Alberta became a destination of choice for many of its younger people in the post 1995 period. Over the past decade Southport has emerged as an increasingly attractive and picturesque tourist destination complete with remnants of its strong English West Country dialect and a proud fishing industry tradition. Heart's Ease Beach Trail, located near the settlement, is quickly becoming a favorite hiking spot.

The Highlands was built in 1794-1796 by Philadelphia merchant and politician Anthony Morris (1766-1860), and was designed by Philadelphia politician Timothy Matlack (1730-1829). It is a large 2 1/2-story, dressed fieldstone structure in the late Georgian style. The front facade features two, two-story, Ionic order pilasters. Morris was the speaker of the Pennsylvania senate, and had signed the bill authorizing troops to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion. He was also a director of the Bank of North America (1800-1806) and a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania (1806-1817). From 1810 to 1814, he was President James Madison's unofficial envoy to Spain. Note: This includes Morris sold the property to Daniel Hittner (1765-1841) in 1808. In the five years that Hittner owned the estate, he accumulated 300+ additional acres. In 1813, it was sold to wine merchant George Sheaff (1779-1851). After Sheaff's death, the heirs sold off the majority of the estate, leaving a mere remaining with Sheaff's grandson, John. In 1917, after the death of the last remaining Sheaff heir, it was sold to Miss Caroline Sinkler, and then subsequently sold to her niece Emily Sinkler Roosevelt in 1941. Roosevelt and her husband donated the property to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1957.The Highlands Mansion and Gardens website Today, the Highlands is a site with a late 18th-century Georgian mansion and formal gardens. It is operated as a museum and historic site by the Highlands Historical Society, a non-profit educational organization. It is available to rent for weddings and parties. The Highlands Historical Society also runs a number of social and fund-raising events throughout the year. One of these events is the annual Highlands Craft Show which began in 1982 as a means to raise funds to support the restoration of the formal garden. The craft show has become an excellent venue where unique artisans throughout the United States can gather to display their crafts within the mansion. Some of the crafts that are offered for sale include fabric, fabric arts, pottery, hand- bags, and hand-crafted jewelry. Other popular events include a pumpkin and jack-o-lantern display which takes place around Halloween, and the Highlands Hunt Breakfast which takes place in early November. The Hunt Breakfast consists of a mock fox hunt equipped with a pack of hounds and approximately 20 local horseback riders who ride through surrounding properties, eventually returning to the mansion to rest and eat breakfast with friends and family.

Transportation Railway Narkhed and Amravati towns in Maharashtra's orange belt have waited for more than 80 years to be linked by rail. The 140-km track was first sanctioned in 1928 under the British, but stayed on the backburner. The project was revived only in 1993/94 and a budget of Rs 2.84 billion approved. The then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao laid the foundation stone. But protests by the Shiv Sena, which opposed the displacement of people, stalled the project for many more years. In September 2008, when President Pratibha Patil inaugurated the New Amravati railway station, it seemed as if the project would be completed soon. Far from it. In November 2009, the Railway Ministry announced the link would be inaugurated in December 2010. Narkhed-Amravati line is ready on January 2014. Railways are now available to travel from Narkhed to Bhusaval. Morshi's railway station has given the name Morshi railway station. The railway station is 2 km from the centre of the Warud city.

History St. Casimir Church was originally the Kotowski Palace, residence of the Wyszogr√≥d stolnik, Adam Kotowski. In 1688 it was purchased by Queen Maria Kazimiera Sobieska to be transformed into a church to serve the Benedictine Sisters of Perpetual Adoration of the Most Holy Sacrament, whom she had brought to Poland. New Town Market Square with St. Kazimierz Church, by Canaletto, 1770. In 1688-92 the Kotowski residence was transformed into a church-cum-cloister, to a design by the leading Polish-Dutch architect Tylman Gamerski. As with many of the buildings that were reconstructed after the Deluge, Tylman designed the church in Palladian style. Between 1718 and 1721 the trompe-l'≈ìil altars of St. Casimir and Virgin Mary were sponsored by Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, voivode of Vilnius. In 1718 the church furnishing was completed with a profuse late baroque pulpit in the shape of a flower and between 1745 and 1748 with a rococo organ. The significant additions in the second half of the 18th century were tombstones of the members of the Sobieski family - Maria Karolina Sobieska de Bouillon (the granddaughter of John III of Poland) and Maria J√≥zefa Sobieska. In 1769, the former 17th century tabernacle was replaced with a new marble one decorated with silver. During the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising the nuns donated some of the church equipment to the army - 12 silver candlesticks from Augsburg, 5 gilded reliquaries, 52 precious votives and 4 statues of angels from the main altar - 412 silver grzywnas worth. In World War II, during the Warsaw Uprising, like nearby St. Hyacinth's Church, St. Kazimierz was used as a hospital. The nuns housed many civilians in the church and cellars and gave medical aid as well as they could. In August 1944 they decided to suspend their rules to assist wounded insurgents. Because of this decision the German military targeted the church and the cloister for heavy bombing. During a single raid on August 31, 1944, four priests, 35 nuns and over a thousand civilians sheltering in the church's crypt were killed. Sobieska's magnificent church and cloisters was destroyed. The church was reconstructed in 1947-53, but the Kotowski Palace was never restored. Interior General view of interior. Designed by Tylman Gamerski, the church consists of a large dome atop a basic Greek cross design. The facade is baroque, although the interior is completely modern, because very few of the original furnishings of the church were preserved. Inside, the most valuable element of the original church's decoration are the preserved fragments of a brilliant tomb monument of Maria Karolina Sobieska de Bouillon carved by Lorenzo Mattielli in white and black marble in 1746. The effigy of the founder in an oval frame was placed atop the plinth with the Janina coat of arms and a royal crown. The whole composition was completed with carved statues of the personification of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and a putto, while the arcade above was adorned with skulls. The tombstone was reconstructed in 1961 by Antoni Szymanowski.

She is best known as one of the first women Street Artists to gain international recognition. Her work centers the transformative capacity of art as a catalyst for healing within communities experiencing crisis. Early life and education A work by Swoon in Djerbahood, Tunisia Caledonia Curry was born in New London, Connecticut, and raised in Daytona Beach, Florida. Both of her parents struggled with opioid addiction; her father became clean, but her mother did not. At the age of 10, her mother enrolled her in art classes for retirees. Curry said, \\"the 80-year-old retired painters adopted me; they taught me how to paint. I‚Äôve [become] a focused, confident artist because of them.\\" At nineteen, she moved to the Borough Park section of Brooklyn, New York to study painting at the Pratt Institute, which she attended from 1998-2001. She received a classical Western education in both technique and career trajectory, which she viewed as too limited. She said ‚Äúthey‚Äôd tell me this is how you paint, these are the galleries that you will work with, and this is how your life is going to be.‚Äù In 1999, searching to carve her own pathway and make her work more accessible to everyday people, she began pasting her paper portraits to the sides of buildings. At first, she pasted work anonymously. Later, she took the moniker Swoon, which appeared in a friend‚Äôs dream. While at Pratt she joined activist groups, including Grub, which provided free community dinners from dumpster-dived food. She also became involved in feminist advocacy as a founding member of the TOYSHOP Collective, a women-run street theater group known for clandestine events in New York City. Career and Work Deitch Projects A work by Swoon in BerlinIn 2005, the Deitch Projects, founded by Jeffrey Deitch, presented Curry‚Äôs first New York solo exhibition: Swoon. The interior and the facade of the gallery was transformed into a cityscape populated by intricate cut out figures and block-prints set within sculptural elements referencing truss- work, power-lines and elevated trains. Drawing on Kowloon Walled City was the creative point of departure, Curry hoped to evoke the spontaneous, unregulated, and self built development that took place in the autonomous Hong Kong neighborhood before it was bulldozed in 1993. When the exhibition opened on July 7, 2005, guests were greeted by the surprise arrival of the band Japanther, which played from the back of a Penske box-truck to a street crowded with over 1,000 people. Swoon was seen crowd-surfing down Grand Street, which Curry discusses in a documentary film by Fredric King, Swoon: fearless (2017). In 2008, Swoon returned to Deitch Projects for an ambitious, two-part exhibition Swimming Cities of Switchback Sea. It included seven handmade boats that embarked from Troy, New York, staging public performances in the towns along the Hudson River. Swoon worked with collaborators Lisa D‚ÄôAmour (playwright), Sxip Shirey (circus composer), and Dark Dark Dark (original music) to create the performance that was set on the boats. The rafts arrived at Deitch Studios in Long Island City on September 7, 2008. The boats were tethered by ropes to the skirts of a twenty-five-foot-high paper sculpture of two sisters embracing, the central image of the massive indoor portion of the show. The cathedral-like space of Deitch Studios was divided into two levels, above and below an imaginary flood line. Curry imagined that if the water of the East River were to rise, her boats could float into the shelter of the gallery space. In 2019, Curry was featured in her third solo exhibition at Deitch Projects, Cicada. The show highlighted the development of the artist‚Äôs practice beyond street art, featuring her first stop-motion animation. The short film addresses the trauma of growing up in an opioid addicted family through mythological figures and feminine allegory, including the ‚ÄúTarantula Mother.‚Äù Jeffrey Deitch has been credited as the gallerist that introduced Swoon to an international art audience, and has continued to advocate for her work. As Director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, Deitch featured Swoon‚Äôs work in Art in the Streets (2011), the first major museum survey of graffiti and street art, curated with Roger Gastman and Aaron Rose.  Career  In 2005, the same year as her breakout solo exhibition, her work was featured in Greater New York at P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, curated by Klaus Biesenbach, and her prints were acquired by the Museum of Modern Art. In 2006, she was included in Since 2000: Printmaking Now, a group exhibition showcasing prints from MoMA‚Äôs collection, organized by Judy Hecker, featuring young artists bringing new approaches to old techniques. Since 2005, Swoon has created over 20 solo exhibitions, most of which are immersive, site-specific installations, in museums and commercial galleries around the world. Her major exhibitions include Seven Contemplations at the Albright-Knox Foundation (2020), Haven at the Skissernas Museum (2017), The Light After at Library Street Collective (2016), Submerged Motherlands at the Brooklyn Museum (2014) which was their first exhibition dedicated to a living street artist, Honeycomb at SNOW Contemporary (2012), Anthropocene Extinction at The Institute of Contemporary Art: Boston (2011), Swimming Cities of Switchback Sea at Deitch Projects (2008), Drown Your Boats at New Image Art Gallery (2008), and Swoon at Deitch Projects (2005). She has also been included in significant group exhibitions including Radical Seafaring at The Parrish Museum of Art (2016), a survey that argues that the work created on the water by contemporary artists is approaching the critical mass of the Land Art movement of the 1960s and 70s; and Catastrophe and the Power of Art at the Mori Art Museum (2018), which considers the role art can play in recovery from major catastrophes that strike communities, as well as personal tragedies. Swoon‚Äôs first museum retrospective, The Canyon: 1999-2017, opened on September 22, 2017 at the Contemporary Arts Center Cincinnati. The exhibition showcased multiple dimensions of Curry‚Äôs practice, including the new site-specific installation Medea, that visually centers around the portrait of a home that is splitting apart, re-stagings of past landmark projects, and a survey of her socially-driven work in Braddock, Pennsylvania and Cormiers, Haiti.  Art as Activism  Swoon‚Äôs site-specific exhibitions are in close dialogue with her activism and advocacy efforts, which explore the power of art to respond to crises caused by natural disasters, structural violence, and addiction. In 2015, she began working with Philadelphia Mural Arts on the multi-platform project 5 Stories. The project drew from her experience growing up in an opioid addicted family. Participants worked with Curry, therapist and yoga instructor Jessica Radovich, and storytelling coach Heather Box of the Million Person Project in a month-long art therapy and personal storytelling course that took place inside Graterford State Correctional Institution (SCI), at the Interim House treatment center, and with Philadelphia Mural Arts Guild, a prison-to-community reentry program. The classes addressed the relationship between trauma, loss, addiction and mass incarceration. In addition to this community engagement, Curry created several portraits of those who have participated in the project, which were incorporated into a public mural at 3060 West Jefferson St in North Philadelphia. Curry returned to Philadelphia in 2018 to continue her harm- reduction advocacy with Philadelphia Mural Arts, Jessica Radovich, Heather Box, and Julian Mocine-Mcqueen. Curry cites Dr. Gabor Mate, author of In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, as someone who changed her perspective by helping her understand that addictions are a desperate attempt to soothe unmanageable pain. This compassionate approach helped Curry forgive her own family members and deepen her conviction that our culture could destigmatize addiction and cultivate healing in our individual responses and public policies if we understood the trauma behind it. The Road Home hosted daily drop-in workshops at the Kensington Storefront, located across the street from Prevention Point, a center that provides services to people experiencing homelessness and addiction. The project culminated in a public conference at the University of Pennsylvania with Dr. Gabor Mate as the keynote speaker, a private workshop with members of Philadelphia‚Äôs Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual disAbility Services, and a public mural, Healing Begins with Connection, across the street from Prevention Point in Kensington.  Collaborative Projects   Music Box  The Music Box was the first iteration of Music Box Village, an immersive, experimental, fully playable musical environment originally built on the site of a collapsed Creole Cottage on Piety Street in New Orleans. In 2011, Swoon, with co-founding members Jay Pennington, Taylor Shepard and Delaney Martin, developed the concept of musical architecture and invited 25 artists to create site-specific installations that would become the initial prototype and sound laboratory. The project began five years after Hurricane Katrina, in response to the long- term struggle towards recovery that continued to impact the livelihood of residents and the distinct musical culture of the city. Curry‚Äôs intention was to cultivate a space for collective play to support the process of healing from disaster. She says \\"I hope it represents this very basic need in people while rebuilding to rebuild joyfully and with imagination.\\" On Oct 22, 2011, The Music Box hosted its debut performance. Over the 9-month initial run, the Music Box received local and national attention, and began to sell out performances, with lines wrapping around the block. The project served over 15,000 guests and hosted over 70 New Orleans-based and international musicians. After the initial run on Piety Street, the project entered an itinerant phase and created short-term performance installations in New Orleans City Park, Kiev, Ukraine and Shreveport, Louisiana. In 2016, the project was renamed Music Box Village and announced their fourth Kickstarter campaign to support a permanent location in the Upper 9th Ward of New Orleans. The campaign was successful. Music Box Village currently runs a calendar of regular night-time performances, as well as daytime hours for guests to explore and play the musical structures. Originally founded with the support of Swoon‚Äôs Heliotrope Foundation, Music Box Village is the flagship project of New Orleans Airlift, an artist-driven non-profit organization whose mission is to collaborate to inspire wonder, connect communities, and foster opportunities through arts education and the creation of experimental public artworks.  Braddock Tiles  In 2007, Swoon and a group of friends were invited to purchase and restore an abandoned church in Braddock, Pennsylvania. Over the next 10 years, Swoon participated in a number of projects that focused on rehabilitating the structure in a way that would also engage and benefit the immediate surrounding community. These efforts included collaborating with local artist collective Transformazium on a deconstruction (as an alternative to demolition) initiative for fire-damaged sections of the building, creating a Super Adobe dome in the building‚Äôs disused parking lot, and, finally, the creation of Braddock Tiles. Braddock Tiles began with the intention of restoring the roof of the church entirely from handmade artisanal tiles that would be created in a ceramics workshop in the basement of the church. This was conceived as a way to create well-paid jobs locally, fostering community reinvestment that would address the economic devastation caused by the closure of the manufacturing sector in Braddock. In 2015, the scope of the project shifted in response to the large scale of resources needed to carry out the renovations needed to restore the church. Choosing to focus on the community building aspect of the project, Braddock Tiles began to work with an existing organization, the Braddock Youth Program, to create a job-readiness and soft skills program for youth ages 18- to 26-years-old, who had aged out of the youth program. The program was held in the Bathhouse Ceramics Studio, located within the historic Braddock Carnegie Library. The Braddock Tiles ran from 2015-2018, and was developed collaboratively by Curry, KT Tierny and Katie Johnson. The program directed the resources collected through their fundraising efforts to paid apprenticeships that would teach local youth ceramic fabrication and leadership skills, as well as host field trips and workshops to foster re-interpretation of local history and youth-led projects that included creating decorative murals for their community. Curry and the Heliotrope Foundation are currently working to pass the care of the building into new hands. Curry has spoken publicly about the significance of this decision, and the importance of recognizing one‚Äôs own limitations. Swimming Cities of Serenissima, 2009 Swimming Cities of SerenissimaSwimming Cities of Serenissima was a fleet of sculptural junk rafts that crashed the 2009 Venice Biennale. The project was the last in a series of river-based projects founded or led by Swoon, which included Swimming Cities of Switchback Sea (2008) on the Hudson River, and The Miss Rockaway Armada (2006-2007) on the Mississippi River. Curry cites multiple sources of inspiration for Serenissima, including a brief time living on a sailboat in the Netherlands, Viking boats, and the impact of her first visit to Venice where she was struck by the conversation between the water and architecture. She also credits the experience of the Miss Rockaway Armada for leading her to explore the possibilities of floating sculptures as a way to live and travel, while also building the knowledge and community necessary to attempt the complicated logistics of navigating rafts through the Ventian lagoon. After her solo exhibition at Deitch Studios, Swoon deconstructed the rafts into shipping containers, which were sent overseas to Koper, Slovenia. The containers were initially held in customs because they were thought to be trash, until Swoon could provide documents that proved they were art. A crew of 30 collaborators worked at a marina in Koper until the rafts received approval by the Slovenian coast guard to leave port. A fleet of three rafts, named Maria, Alice and Old Hickory navigated an open crossing of the Adriatic Sea, before moving into the protected in-land Littoral canals of Italy. Swimming Cities of Serenissima entered the Venetian Lagoon in May 2009. Swoon developed a collaborative performance with Ben Burke, Adina Bier and the Dark, Dark, Dark, that was staged on the rafts and performed to audiences on shore over the course of two weeks. The final performance was an illegal procession down the Grand Canal that began late at night, and ended as the sun rose. Serenissima‚Äôs last performance, as well as their journey across the Adriatic, was recorded in a documentary film by Paul Poet, Empire Me: New Worlds are Happening! (2011). Although Swoon was not officially invited to the Biennale, Serenissma was lauded by the critic Jerry Saltz as the most moving moment of that years‚Äô festival. He said, ‚ÄúLike the best work here, Swoon‚Äôs work doesn‚Äôt come out of academic critique; it comes from necessity and vision. These are the perfect tools for making things as old as time new again  including an art world turned dangerously into itself.‚Äù Konbit Shelter Burgundy Poland Union Swoon Konbit Shelter was founded in 2010, in response to the earthquake in Haiti killed more than 100,000 people and destroyed more than 250,000 homes. Curry led a small group of artists, engineers, and builders who connected with the village of Komye (Cormiers in French), 15 miles from the epicenter of the quake. The project‚Äôs mission centered on the belief that the creative process can help in this time of crisis. Konbit Shelter has focused on creating meaningful work and well-paid jobs for local residents while collectively creating beautiful permanent architectural answers to the problem of rebuilding from disaster using new strategies with limited resources. Since 2010, Konbit Shelter has completed a community center and three single-family homes, each designed and adapted with feedback from the community. Local enthusiasm around the art and design elements of the construction process led to the creation of a Klub Obzevatwa, an ongoing after-school program founded in partnership with local teachers in Cormiers. Each week, Klub Obzevatwa teachers introduce 30-40 local kids to arts, crafts, and building design concepts that range from drawing, cooking, tile-setting, earthquake preparedness, Haitian culture and history, and games, song and dance. Konbit Shelter and Klub Obzevatwa are currently the flagship projects supported by Swoon‚Äôs Heliotrope Foundation.  The Miss Rockaway Armada  The Miss Rockaway Armada, was a collectively realized semi-utopian experiment in communal living and home-made raft navigation that travelled down the Mississippi River from Minneapolis to St. Louis during two summers in 2006 and 2007. Swoon was one of several New York City-based artists that founded the initial concept, and who was instrumental in raising funds and other resources for its execution; however the project was led using a co-operative model that had as many as 70 rolling members over two years, and was not directed by Swoon. Swoon cites her inspiration for the Miss Rockaway Armada on the Floating Neutrinos, a group of artists led by Poppa Neutrino, who lived communally on the water and successfully completed a trans-atlantic crossing on a hand-made junk raft in 1998; as well as a long tradition of punk boat culture in the city of Minneapolis. The Miss Rockaway Armada was partially constructed in the Emergency Arts cooperative in Chelsea, before being transported to Minneapolis. They were designed using two VW diesel rabbit car engines that were modified to run long-arm boat propellers. The first version of the rafts included three twenty-foot long interconnected structures, pulling several tows, which made it nearly 100 feet long. The rafts pushed off at White Sands in 2006, and performed musical variety shows and arts workshops in the towns along the river. The project dry docked at a restaurant and biker-bar called Ducky‚Äôs Lagoon in the Quad Cities when the weather became too cold to continue. In 2007, the rafts were reconfigured into smaller vessels, and new members joined who built new rafts. The flotilla travelled south to St. Louis, where they made an emergency landing on Bob Cassilly‚Äôs land, the founder of the City Museum of St. Louis, after river conditions became too dangerous to navigate. While the remaining collective members camped on Cassilly‚Äôs land, the rafts were eventually all burned, or cut loose from shore and disappeared. When asked about how she felt about the project ending before reaching their New Orleans destination, Swoon said ‚ÄúThe deep, deep truth of the matter is that I don‚Äôt regret it. I only regret that [the boats] were disposed of in an irresponsible way. The fact that no one died is basically a miracle, and if we had gone past Saint Louis where there are no locking dams with our boats, and our crew, and the culture we were building, it would‚Äôve gotten really dangerous.‚Äù Heliotrope Foundation In 2015, Curry founded the Heliotrope Foundation to help support her community-based projects: Konbit Shelter and Klub Obzevatwa in Cormiers, Haiti; Braddock Tiles in Braddock, Pennsylvania and Music Box in New Orleans, Louisiana. Heliotrope‚Äôs mission is to build spaces of wonder that serve as catalysts for local change. Heliotrope projects have been supported by hundreds of donors and individual patrons through Kickstarter campaigns, fundraiser events, and through ongoing affordable print sales featuring the work of contemporary artists and local artisans from the communities served.  Street Art  Swoon is widely known as one of the first women to achieve large-scale recognition as a Street Artist. She was part of a group of artists early 00‚Äôs, including JR and Banksy, that were committed to pushing the forms and conceptual limits of the Street Art genre. Swoon has wheatpasted her intricate portraits on city streets around the world, including New York, Detroit, San Francisco, London, Bilbao, Hong Kong, Djerba, Cairo, Tokyo, and Jogjakarta. She has been included in public art interventions including Santa‚Äôs Ghetto (2007), a clandestine installation on the West Bank barrier wall in Bethlehem, organized by Banksy; Hecho en Oaxaca (2013), and indoor and outdoor exhibition of Street Art organized by Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo Oaxaca; and Open Source (2015) a city-wide public art exhibition organized by Philadelphia Mural Arts, featuring the mural 5 Stories, created in tandem with arts therapy workshops with participants in the Mural Arts Restorative Justice Program. Her intricate wheatpaste portraits are created by carving wood or linoleum blocks, which are then printed by hand, or by cutting through several layers of paper at once. Her imagery is drawn from friends, family and other people she has met whose lives she wants to honor. She often elevates subjects who are unseen or overlooked within the urban landscape, or marginalized within the infrastructure of the city itself. Her memorial portrait of Silvia Elena Morales (2008), who was murdered in Juarez, Mexico, addressed the ongoing femicides that have claimed the lives of thousands of women in Mexico and Central America since 1993. In a visit to Juarez, Curry met with mothers who had lost their daughters, and with activists who were working to increase public awareness and to push for justice. The piece was installed in 2012 at Benito Juarez Plaza, the place where Sylvia Elena is thought to have disappeared, four years after it was created because of delays caused by escalating violence. Curry‚Äôs intention behind the memorial was ‚Äúthat we can see the face of Sylvia Elena, and recognize our connectedness with each of the thousands of women who have gone missing, with each of the family members who mourn the loss of their brightest light, and with a town in the shadow of the U.S. border, caught in a strangle hold of incomprehensible violence.‚Äù Solo Exhibitions 2020, Seven Contemplations, Albright-Knox Foundation, Buffalo, NY. 2020, The Heart Lives through the Hands, Contemporary Craft, Pittsburgh, PA, scheduled April 25 - August 1 (postponed in response to Covid-19) 2020, Asteraceae, Underdogs Gallery, Lisbon, Portugal, July 10 - August 8. 2020, Swoon: Time Capsule, multi-city travelling exhibition, Museum of Urban and Contemporary Art, Munich, Germany, May - August. 2020, The Slow Reprise, Galerie LJ, Paris, France, June 25 - September 26. 2019, Cicada, Deitch Projects, New York, NY, November 14 - February 1. 2019, Swoon: Time Capsule, multi-city travelling exhibition, Fluctuart Centre d‚ÄôArt Urbain, Paris, France, July 4 - September 22. 2019, Swoon: Every Portrait is a Vessel, Treason Gallery, Seattle, WA, April 4 - May 18. 2019, Swoon, Galerie Henrik Springmann, Freiburg, Germany. 2018, Raggedy Hecate and the Memory Box, Chandran Gallery, San Francisco, CA, November 30 - February 8. 2018, Mirai Minima, SNOW Contemporary, Tokyo, Japan, October 6 - November 2. 2018, Swoon: New Works, Galerie LJ, Paris, France, October 11 - November 24. 2017, The Canyon: 1999-2017, retrospective, Contemporary Art Center, curated by Steven Matijcio, Cincinnati, OH, September 23 - February 25. 2017, To Accompany Something Invisible, Allouche Gallery, New York, NY, April 27 - May 21. 2017, Haven, Skissernas Museum, Malm√∂, Sweden, January 28 - November 21, 2018. 2016, Thalassa, Detroit Institute of Arts Museum, Detroit, MI, September 24 - June 25. 2016, The Light After, Library Street Collective, Detroit, MI, October 8 - November 26. 2016, City Lights, site-specific installation, MIMA Contemporary Art Museum, Brussels, Belgium, March 24 - August 28. 2014, Swoon: Submerged Motherlands, Brooklyn Museum, curated by Sharon Matt Atkins, Brooklyn, NY, April 11 - Aug. 24. 2013, Motherlands, Galerie LJ, Paris, France, November 30 - January 15. 2013, Petrichor, Manatee-Sarasota Fine Art Gallery, State College of Florida, Brandenton, FL, March 1 - April 3. 2012, Honeycomb, SNOW Contemporary, Tokyo, Japan, April 4 - May 20. 2011, Murmuration, site-specific installation, Black Rat Projects, London, England, December 1 - December 24. 2011, Anthropocene Extinction, site-specific installation, The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, Massachusetts, September 3 - December 30, 2012. 2011, Swoon: Thalassa (The Great Hall Project), site-specific installation, New Orleans Museum of Art, New Orleans, LA, July 8 - September 25. 2011, Thekla, Metro Gallery, Melbourne, Australia, February 14 - March 5. 2010, Fata Morgana, Galerie LJ, Paris, France, October 24 - December 4. 2008, Swoon: Swimming Cities of Switchback Sea, site-specific installation with public performances, Deitch Studios, Long Island City, NY, September 7 - October 19. 2008, Portrait of Silvia Elena, Honey Space Gallery, New York, NY, May 2008. 2008, Drown Your Boats, New Image Art Gallery, Los Angeles, CA, February 16- April 19. 2008, Swoon, site-specific installation, Deitch Projects, New York, NY, July 7 - August 13.

Mudgal is about 10 miles south-west of Lingsugur. Mudgal has several inscriptions belonging to the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri. It is known for its historical heritage and communal harmony. The main attractions here are the remnants of the Mudgal fort and an ancient Roman Catholic church built by the Jesuits before 1557. There are ancient temples of Aswathhanarayana, Venkatesha, Narasimha and Didderayah. History Mudgal's existence dates back to Neolithic era. Mudgal is also known as Lord Ganesha's teacher. Mudgal is one of the most important places of historical interest in Raichur District, next in importance only to Raichur. Mudgal or Mudugal has a history dating back to the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri, several inscriptions of which have been discovered in and around the town. In 11th century Mudgal was an educational centre for the students of various parts of the country. In the beginning of the 14th century, it was an important outpost of the Kakatiya kingdom. Ala-ud-din Bahman Shah, after seizing Devagiri, captured Mudgal along with Raichur. Some recent controversy regarding the original name of Mudgal had arisen by many Historians claiming that it was actually called \\"Al- Madaggal\\" during the Bahmani Sultanate era meaning \\"Place which has been agriculturally cultivated\\" in Arabic since the Bahmani Turks were predominantly Turko-Arab. After the establishment of the Bahamani Dynasty, the Bijapur kings took possession of the western and southern parts of the territory of the Bahmani kingdom including the forts of Raichur and Mudgal. During 16th century Mudgal was ruled by Vijayanagar Empire. Many battles were fought between Vijayanagar emperors and Bahamani sultans. Vijayanagar empire's Krishna devaraya after undertaking raichur then he went across mudgal to Bijapur in his campaign There is also a folk song on mudgal \\"‡≤Ü ‡≤ï‡≤≤‡≥ç‡≤≤ ‡≤à ‡≤ï‡≤≤‡≥ç‡≤≤ ‡≤π‡≤ö‡≥ç‡≤ö ‡≤π‡≤≥‡≤¶‡≤ø ‡≤ï‡≤≤‡≥ç‡≤≤ ‡≤á‡≤≥‡≤ï‡≤≤‡≥ç ‡≤Ö‡≤¶‡≤∞ ‡≤Æ‡≥Å‡≤Ç‡≤¶‡≤ø‡≤∞‡≥Å‡≤µ ‡≤Æ‡≥Å‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤§‡≤ø‡≤® ‡≤ï‡≤≤‡≥ç‡≤≤ ‡≤Æ‡≥Å‡≤¶‡≥ç‡≤ó‡≤≤‡≥ç\\" Places of interest Mudgal fort. Mudgal fort. The most important place of interest at Mudgal is the fort. In the construction of the fort at Mudgal, advantage was taken of a hillock on the top of which were built houses of the royalty and a wall with bastions. The outer fortifications of Mudgal cover an area of half a square mile. The outer fort has a wide moat, which is filled with water. The width of the moat varies, being as much as 50 yards at several places. Behind the moat, there is a scarp with a row of bastions and after that, a narrow covered passage and adjoining it the counter scarp with very massive bastions. From the arrangement of the existing fort, it is apparent that the fort was rebuilt after the invention of guns. The courses of masonry at several places are of Hindu style, but the arch-shaped parapet is of Muslim design. The moat and the row of bastions together offer a pleasing view. In front of the Fateh Darwaza, which faces north, there is a very massive bastion, with a curtain on each side, thus making a barbican for the defence of the fort. Near this barbican is a guard's room with three arched openings towards the north. The barbican has a narrow court with entrances towards the west and north-east, the gates of which are built in the pillar-and-lintel style. In the covered passage of this gateway, there are guards‚Äô rooms on both sides. The massive bastion above referred to has a gun with a Kannada inscription near the muzzle. The gun has long iron pieces in its interior, which have been bound outwardly by hoops. There is another gateway on the western side, behind the narrow passage of which there is a second gateway with an arch. The walls at this point are cyclopean in construction. There are guards‚Äô rooms on either side of the passage of this gateway also. There is a third gateway to the left of the second, also arched, but the apex, as in the case of the previous one, is filled up with masonry. This gateway is more massive in construction than the other two, the guard's room attached to its passage also being more commodious. There is a mosque near this gateway, which consists of a double- pillared hall, the pillars being of Hindu design. On the opposite side of the road are the remains of the Naubat Khana. On the way to the Bala Hisar is the gunpowder magazine, where, at one end, two compartments have been built for the storage of gunpowder. Local Food and Cuisine Food preferences of the local people are similar to the North Karnataka region, but with influences from Hyderabadi, Marathi, South Karnataka and Konkani cuisines due to the vicinity of those cities to Mudgal. Arabian cuisine is important due to ancestry of the Sayyid tribes as well as diaspora who are settled in the Middle East and bring back Arabian culture. Milk and dairy products are produced, consumed and transported in large quantities due to the common practice of rearing sheep, cattle and buffaloes. Elderly Mudgal people show pride in making dairy products at home as it used to be a symbol of prestige for the host family to show their dairy product manufacturing skills to guests. although this practice is dwindling with the younger generation who are migrating outside of Mudgal. Meat products such as chicken, fish, mutton and beef are also produced. The mutton of Mudgal is highly reverered due to its succulent taste owing to fresh feed available to livestock. Many local dishes are dairy or meat based.

Peanuts and sunflowers are also cultivated in large quantities to produce cooking oil, chutney and achaars. Jaggery is produced in large quantities and exported due to sugarcane and sugarbeet cultivation. Chilli pepper cultivation is also on a large scale with local varieties of cayenne and paprika. They are used to flavor many local dishes - locals are accustomed to a high chili heat quotient. Many other Indian spices are also cultivated. Some of the local favorite dishes are: Huldey is a local dish made from a mixture of boiled cereal grains as well as grams and peanuts with some ghee and spices.

Sometimes vegetables are also added. It is usually spicy. Arabi Tahari is a new type of dish which is gaining popularity due to Middle Eastern influences. It is a cross between the Mudgali tahari and the Arabic kabsa but not as spicy. Gud ki Roti is a sweet dish is made by adding jaggery powder during the kneading of the flat bread and then cooking over a flame. Its sometimes served mashed up with bananas and milk. Gud ki chai is a type of tea made with boiling milk and jaggery. Masale ki Chaanch is a type of buttermilk flavored with masala mirchi and other spices.

Career  Films she has appeared in include Tom-Yum-Goong. She portrayed a young Thai woman forced into prostitution in Australia who comes to the aid of the film's hero, Tony Jaa. Alternate spellings of her name include Bongkot (or Bongkote) Kongmalai and Bonkoch Konmala√Ø. Her first film role was in Tanit Jitnukul's historical epic about the battle of Bang Rajan. She studies at Ramkhamhaeng University. Tak's major debut as a dramatic actress was in 2004's Ai-Fak, based on the S.E.A. Write Award-winning novel, Kham Phiphaksa (The Judgment), by Chart Korbjitti. She portrayed a mentally ill young woman who is married to a much older man. When her husband dies, her care is entrusted to the man's son, Fak, who is then ostracized by his fellow villagers because they believe he is having sexual relations with his stepmother. In 2005, she was seen in Hit Man File, alongside Chatchai Plengpanich and Tom-Yum-Goong, which in 2006 was screened in the United States as The Protector. Also in 2006, she starred in the action comedy Chai Lai, about five female crimefighters, and then later in the year starred in the thriller, The Passion. Controversies In 2004 Tak was at the center of a controversy when nude photos of her, taken on the set of Ai-Fak, appeared on the Thai Internet forum, Pantip.com. Police were able to track the uploader down and the man was arrested. Tak asked that charges against the man be dropped after he issued a public apology, and she said she did so because the man hadn't smuggled the photos from the film set. A complaint was also filed against the film's production company for taking the photos.The Nation, \\"Actress drops nude picture complaint\\" , September 29, 2004. In May 2012, Tak generated a wave of criticism when she mocked the death of Thai prisoner Ampon Tangnoppakul in her Facebook status updates, describing his death as karma; a 62-year-old grandfather, Ampon had been jailed for sending text messages critical of Queen Sirikit. After the negative fan reaction, Tak deleted the posts and apologized, but her royalist comments reflect deep prejudice in Thailand in favor of iconic views of the country's monarchy and the overpowering influence of the Thai military.

The subspecies is endemic to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. In places its range overlaps that of S. c. tergeminus, and intergrading of the two subspecies is known. Etymology The subspecific name, edwardsii, is in honor of Colonel Dr. Lewis A. Edwards (1824‚Äì1877), a U.S. Army surgeon,Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson; Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii, p. 81). who collected the type specimen.Baird & Girard (1853). Description S. c. edwardsi pair in copula (mating) Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii is more slender and smaller than S. c. tergeminus, reaching a maximum total length (including tail) of . The color pattern consists of a light gray or white base color, with dark gray or gray-brown blotches. It has a distinctive, dark stripe that runs along the side of the head, which passes over the eye. The rattle is significantly higher pitched than those of larger species of rattlesnakes, sometimes giving it the nickname \\"buzztail\\". Compared to S. c. tergeminus, it is paler in color, and its belly is nearly white. Midbody, it has 23 rows of dorsal scales instead of 25, as well as fewer ventral scales and dorsal blotches. Geographic range Sistrurus catenatusedwardsii is found in extreme southeastern Arizona, central and southern New Mexico, West Texas about as far north and east as the Colorado River, in the Rio Grande Valley, in many of the Gulf Coast counties about as far north as Brazoria, and on several barrier islands including North Padre Island, Matagorda Island and San Jos√© Island. In addition, isolated populations have been reported in northeastern Mexico.Klauber LM (1997). Rattlesnakes: Their Habitats, Life Histories, and Influence on Mankind. Second Edition. First published in 1956, 1972. Berkeley: University of California Press. .Campbell JA, Lamar WW (2004). The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. Ithaca and London: Comstock Publishing Associates. 870 pp. 1,500 plates. . The type locality is listed as \\"Tamaulipas ... S. Bank of Rio Grande ... Sonora\\". Habitat Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii is primarily found in rocky, semiarid, and arid areas. According to Conant (1975), it is mostly found in desert grasslands. Behavior Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii is primarily nocturnal, especially during the summer, when the weather is too hot for it to be active, but it will sometimes be found basking. Feeding The diet of S. c. edwardsii consists primarily of rodents, lizards, and frogs. Venom Drop for drop, massasauga venom is more potent than that of many larger species of rattlesnakes, but due to the lower yield (the amount it is capable of delivering in a single bite), its potential for harm is greatly reduced. It is not considered to be deadly, but the venom is a powerful cytotoxic venom that can cause swelling, necrosis, damage to the skin, and severe pain. Medical treatment should be sought immediately for any venomous snake bite. The antivenin CroFab, while not type-specific, can be used to treat severe envenomations from massasaugas. Conservation status The desert massasauga is listed as a species of concern in Colorado, due to its limited range in the state, and it is protected by Arizona state law. It is listed as a sensitive species by the United States Forest Service. References Further reading *Baird SF, Girard CF (1853).

Lovecraft, penned in March 1922 and first published in the May 1923 issue of National Amateur. Plot \\"Hypnos\\" is a first-person narrative, written from the perspective of an unnamed character living in Kent and later London, England. The narrator writes that he fears sleep, and is resolved to write his story down lest it drive him further mad, regardless of what people think after reading it. The narrator, a sculptor, recounts meeting a mysterious man in a railway station. The moment the man opened his \\"immense, sunken, and widely luminous eyes\\", the narrator knew that the stranger would become his friend-‚Äì\\"the only friend of one who had never possessed a friend before.\\" In the eyes of the stranger, he witnessed important knowledge of the mysteries he always sought to learn. From this point on, he would touch his friend and sculpt him daily. At night they would commence their adventures, exploring worlds beyond human comprehension. Over time, the narrator's companion begins to speak of using their ability to transcend into the unknown as a way to rule the universe (via a set of drugs). The narrator is frightened by the prospect and disavows such hubris to the reader. Soon the narrator is off on a foray with his friend, travelling through a void that he explains is beyond human sensation. Passing through several barriers, eventually the narrator comes to one he cannot cross, though his friend does. Opening his \\"physical eyes\\", the narrator wakes up and awaits the return of his friend, who awakes severely shaken and reticent, warning only that they must avoid sleep at all cost. From then on, with the aid of drugs, the two avoid sleep, as each time they succumb, they both seem to rapidly age and are plagued by nightmares that the narrator refuses to explain. The story ends with the narrator explaining that one night, his friend fell into a \\"deep-breathing sleep\\" and was impossible to arouse. The narrator shrieks, faints, and awakes surrounded by police and neighbors, who inform him that his friend was not real. There is only a statue of his friend in his room, engraved with the Greek word: Œ•Œ†ŒùŒüŒ£ (Hypnos). Significance Lovecraft dedicated this story to his longtime friend Samuel Loveman, who featured in the dreams that inspired Lovecraft's \\"The Statement of Randolph Carter\\" and \\"Nyarlathotep\\". Loveman suggested it was the best thing Lovecraft had ever written up to that point in time, as mentioned by Lovecraft in a letter.H. P. Lovecraft, Selected Letters, Vol. 1, p. 176. The plot-germ of the story is found in Lovecraft's commonplace book, in an early entry (#23) reading, \\"The man who would not sleepdares not sleeptakes drugs to keep himself awake. Finally falls asleep& something happens.\\"H. P. Lovecraft, Miscellaneous Writings. As in many of Lovecraft's writings, the terror and the world are unknowable. This fits into Lovecraft's common themes as to the alien and hostile nature of the universe, infinity, and the futility of everything. Even at the end of the story, the fate and the narrator's relations themselves are left up to question, again, in keeping with Lovecraft's standard modus operandi.H. P. Lovecraft, Letters to Alfred Galpin, pp. 75-79. Connections The story ties into other stories by Lovecraft and associated writers: *The connection between the stars and a person, is also featured in Lovecraft's \\"Beyond the Wall of Sleep\\" and \\"Polaris.\\" *A few of the references to Greek sculpture also appear in his previous story \\"The Tree.\\" *The use of a drug to venture through a barrier is also used in Lovecraft's \\"Ex Oblivione.\\" *The use of drugs to experience strange worlds (to the detriment of the user) is also featured in Clark Ashton Smith's \\"Chain of Aforgomon\\" and Frank Belknap Long's \\"The Hounds of Tindalos\\".

It was established in July 1949, with Xu Beihong as its first chairman. It has 6,000 members, and the current chairman is Fan Di'an. Organization The China Artists Association is under the leadership of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, and managed by the Central Committee Publicity Department. It previously operated provincial-level branches in all of China's provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, but in 1990 the provincial branches were reorganized into provincial artists associations and admitted into the national association as group members. The national association oversees many specialized subordinate committees, including those for Chinese painting, oil painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, print, fresco, animation, ethnic art, and children's art. The association organizes the national art exhibition, China's largest art exhibition, every five years. Ten sessions have been held as of 2011. Regional artists associations would select works from artists in the local area and submit them to the higher level for consideration. For individual artists, having works selected for the national exhibition brings fame and improves prospects for promotion. Many of them become heads of lower-level artists associations.

The 2011 Census of India put the total population of Sri Muktsar Sahib municipality to 117,085, making it the 14th largest city of Punjab, in terms of population. Historically known as Khidrana or Khidrane di dhab, the city was made the district headquarters in 1995. Chronological evidence indicates that the city was named Muktsar after the battle of Muktsar in 1705. The government officially changed the name of the city to Sri Muktsar Sahib in 2012, though the city is still primarily referred to by its unofficial name ‚Äì Muktsar. History and etymology Early history The modern day Muktsar city was historically a semi-desert terrain named Khidrana or Khidrane de dhab, situated near a lake. Not much is known about the early history of the present area of the city. This may partly be due to the river Sutlej. The Sutlej is notorious for shifting its course, and it is stated to have flowed as far east as Muktsar within historical times. While shifting its course it is said to have leveled down everything that came its way, leaving behind ruins and mounds of earth and pottery debris. The present area of Muktsar is almost entirely destitute of ancient buildings and contains no places mentioned in early records. Legends connected with Raja S√°lb√°n attach to one or two other ruined sites near Muktsar such as that at Sarai Naga, 10 miles (16 km) to the east of Muktsar. But the city does not date from an earlier period than the reign of Akbar. Medieval history The territory of which Muktsar now forms a part of was formerly ruled by the Paramara Rajputs who held it for a considerable period. Jiwa moved to the neighborhood of Muktsar where his descendants held a group of villages, and his grandson Abdulla Khan became the zaildar of Muktsar. About the time of the first Muslim conquests of India, a colony of Bhati Rajputs, of whose stock the tribes of Manj, Naipal and Dogra Rajputs are branches, came from Jaisalmer under a leader, called Rai Hel, and settled to the south of the present town of Muktsar. They overcame the local Paramara chief and firmly established themselves. Burar had two sons, Paur and Dhul, the younger of whom held almost the whole of the region of Muktsar. During the decay of the Delhi Empire, the country, which had apparently become almost depopulated, was occupied by the Dogras, a clan of Rajput origin, who are still prominent among the occupants of Muktsar. The rulers, who were Islamic and called themselves converted descendants of the Chauhans of Delhi, emigrated some years ago to the neighbourhood of Pakpattan; and from thence, two centuries ago, spread for a hundred miles along both banks of the river Sutlej from a few miles above Ferozepur to the borders of Bahawalpur. At one time they were undoubted masters of Mamdot and Khai, as well as of Ferozepor including the present area of Muktsar; their seats were principally in the Khadir of the Sutlej, and their occupations pastoral and predatory. In March 1504, the second Sikh guru, Guru Angad Dev, was born at Matte-di-Sarai (now called Sarai Naga), about 6 miles from Muktsar. His father Bhai Pheru was a Trehan Khatri merchant, and mother, Ramo, a housewife. Battle of Muktsar An artist's expression of the Battle of Muktsar, 1705 In 1705, after battle of Chamkaur against the Mughals, Guru Gobind Singh started looking out for a suitable place from where he could defend himself. Assisted by an experienced guide of a Brar chief, the guru reached Khidrane Di Dhab where he finally decided to meet the enemy. He then received news that he was being pursued by the imperial troops, at least 10,000 strong, under Wazir Khan, subedar of Sirhind. Earlier, in 1704, when the Guru Gobind Singh's Army in Anandpur Sahib had run out of provisions, 40 Sikhs from Majha deserted him, where they signed a declaration saying they were no longer the Sikhs of Guru Gobind Singh and he was no longer their guru. Now, those 40 deserters came back to join the guru's forces, realizing their mistake of deserting him, under the motivation of a woman fighter, Mai Bhago. The Sikhs engaged the Mughal forces. Guru Gobind Singh also sent reinforcements, though the number of Sikh soldiers is disputed. Historians like Latif have put it at 12,000, though the Sikh chroniclers say they were far fewer, some say as few as forty. They showered arrows from his strategic position on the mound, down upon the imperial army, killing a number of them. The resistance of the Sikhs became fierce. The enemy became restive for want of water. It was not possible for them to reach the lake of Khidrana. As it was semi-desert terrain and the summer heat was reaching its peak, the guru knew of its importance and based his defenses around the water reservoir. The only water they could get was fifteen miles behind them. Thirst and oppressive heat, and the tough resistance offered by the Sikhs, compelled the Mughal army to retreat. Guru Gobind Singh won this last Mughal-Khalsa battle, which had resulted in heavy casualties. At the end of the battle, when he was looking for survivors, Mai Bhago, who was lying wounded, told him how the forty deserters had laid down their lives fighting in the battlefield. Mai Bhago recovered and remained in the Guru's presence after the battle of Muktsar. When Guru Gobind Singh, along with his Sikhs, was collecting the dead bodies for cremation, he found one man, named Mahan Singh, still clinging to life. On seeing the Guru, he made an effort to rise; the Guru at once took him in his embrace, and sat down with him. Mahan Singh, tearful and exhausted, requested the guru to destroy the document disclaiming his being a Sikh of the Guru. Before Mahan Singh died, Guru Gobind Singh took the document and tore it up. It is a legendary belief that this gave \\"mukti\\", meaning freedom, to those 40 Sikhs and hence, the city got its modern-day name Muktsar, where the word \\"sar\\" is derived from the word \\"sarovar\\", meaning reservoir, with reference to the Kidrana reservoir. Post battle of Muktsar In the days of persecution of the Sikhs, Jassa Singh often took refuge in the jungles of Muktsar. The territories of Muktsar, Kotkapura, Mari and Mudki together with the Faridkot State, formed originally one territory, with its capital at Kotkapura. In 1807, Dewan Mokham Chand conquered the whole of this territory from Tegh Singh, and added it to the Lahore demesne. Mohkam Chand established thanas at Muktsar, Kotkapura and Mari and since that time the villages subject to these thanas have been known as separate territories. Ram Singh, leader of the Namdhari sect, visited Muktsar in 1861 on the occasion of Mela Maghi to deliver his message. However, the priests of Muktsar Gurudwara refused to pray for Ram Singh, unless he agreed, by way of penalty for his \\"un-Sikh\\" ways, to pay the entire cost of masonry for the local tank. Modern history After India gained independence from the British in August 1947, there was an aggressive exodus of the non-Muslims from West Punjab and that of Muslims from the East Punjab. A large number of refugees from the Bahawalpur state and from Montgomery and Lahore districts entered India through the border along the Firozpur district, of which Muktsar was a part of. According to the 1951 Census, 349,767 refugees from Pakistan settled in the Firozpur district including the erstwhile Muktsar and Moga tehsils. The Muktsar city remained a tehsil of Ferozepur district from August 1947 to August 1972, and then it became a teshil of the newly carved out district, Faridkot. In November 1995, Muktsar became a district city. In February 2012, the city was officially renamed Sri Muktsar Sahib. Geography Muktsar is located in the south- western part of the Punjab state in north India. The city is spread over an area of 12.66 square miles (32.80 square Km). The geographical coordinates of the city are 30¬∞ 29' 0\\" North, and 74¬∞ 31' 0\\" East. Nearby cities include Bathinda 33 miles (53 km) to the south east, Ferozepur 32 miles (52 km) to the north, Faridkot 31 miles (50 km ) to the north east and Abohar 35 miles (56 km) to the south west. The state capital, Chandigarh, lies 249 km (155 miles) east to Muktsar. The city of Ludhiana is 92 miles (148 km) and Amritsar lies 104 miles (167 km) away. The Indian capital, New Delhi, lies 247 miles (398 km) south east to Muktsar. Topography The average land elevation of the city is 648.52 feet (197.67 metres) above sea level. Lithologically, Muktsar is a part of the vast Indo-Gangetic alluvial plain, composed of alternate bands of sands, silt and clay with pebbles. Sandy plains, sand dunes and topographic depressions are the common landforms. Pedology The soil of Muktsar varies from sandy to loam in texture, and is low in organic carbon, phosphorus, zinc and other micro nutrients, but high in potassium. The salt affected soil of Muktsar has been categorized as sodic soil and saline sodic soil. The villages surrounding the city produce high yields of cotton, wheat, paddy and seed oil. Climate Climatically, the Western Himalaya in the north and the Thar Desert in the south and south-west mainly influence the climatic conditions. Since the city lies far away from the Sivalik Hills, and any of the major rivers, it experiences an extreme climate situation. Summers are extremely hot, and winters very cold. The city experiences four distinct seasons - spring (February - March), summer (April - August), fall/autumn (September - October) and winter (November - January), along with the monsoon season setting in towards the later half of the summer. Summers, from early April to mid October, are typically very hot and humid, with an average daily June high temperature of 104 ¬∞F (40 ¬∞C). The season experiences heat indices easily breaking 110 ¬∞F (43 ¬∞C). Winters are very cold and foggy with few sunny days, and with a December daytime average of 37.4 ¬∞F (3 ¬∞C). The Western Disturbance brings some rain in winters that further adds to the chill. Spring and autumn are mild and pleasant seasons with low humidity. The monsoon season usually starts in the first week of July and continues till August. Thunderstorms are not uncommon during the Monsoon. The mean annual rainfall fluctuates around 425 mm. About 71 per cent of the annual rainfall in the city is received during the monsoon season. Demographics Muktsar is the 14th most populated city of the Punjab. According to the 2011 census of India, Muktsar urban city has a population of 117,085, of which males constitute 61,725 (52.87%) and females 55,022 (46.99%). The total number of households in the city is 23,644. The population under the age of 6 is recorded as 13,981, of which 7,646 are males and 6,335 females. The total number of literates in the city are 78,606, with 44,089 males and 34,517 females. 36,084 people work full-time in the city, of which a majority of them are males, constituting at 31,081 (86.14%) and only 5,003 (13.86%) females.

Muktsar also has a few adherents of Buddhism, Jainism, Islam and Christianity. Culture The contemporary lifestyle of the city is still strongly grounded in the traditional Punjabi culture, though the residents have customized the modernization, retaining the elements of their original culture. People often tend to be conservative in thoughts, opinions and clothes as compared to bigger cities. Since Muktsar lacks any major industry interaction or activity, it is largely not impacted by the modern cosmopolitan culture. The city has a share of troubles as small towns are low on priority list of everyone. However, the traditional Punjabi culture in Muktsar is rich, emphasizing family values and respect for elders. Regional as well as national festivals - Lohri, Holi, Gurpurbs and Diwali - are celebrated with great fervor. Weddings in the city are an elaborate, expensive arrangement, with the rituals extending for days, accompanied with songs, music, dance, traditional dresses and food. Traditional dance forms include bhangra and giddha. Muktsar is well renowned for Muktsari kurta pajama and Muktsari jutti. Languages and dialect Punjabi is the main language spoken in the city, and is spoken with a Malwai dialect. People also understand Hindi, though it is spoken with a Punjabi accent. Rajasthani is another dialect spoken in the city because of its proximity to the State of Rajasthan. Since some migrants from other states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar come to Muktsar for manual unskilled jobs, the number of Hindi speakers has increased. A small segment of the city's population can comprehend English. Cuisine Wheat, in the form of rotis and parathas, forms the staple food of the city, which is eaten with cooked vegetables or legumes, usually in a spicy curry, using cooking oil. The common vegetables include potato, cauliflower, eggplant, okra and carrot. The popular legumes often cooked in the form of curry are lentil, chickpea, pigeon pea, black gram, peas and beans. Rice and dairy products are also an important component of the local food. Paneer - milk solids pressed under a weight and cut into cubes - is an expensive dairy food, eaten as curry with peas or other vegetables. The food is often supplemented by dairy products, such as yogurt or clarified butter, chutneys, pickles, papad onion, cucumbers or tomatoes. The local cuisine is well classified into two categories: vegetation and non-vegetation. However, meat is expensive, so most people cannot afford to eat meat or fish everyday, and even affluent people eat relatively little meat by western standards. Western style breakfast of toast, eggs, or prepared breakfast cereals is gaining popularity in the city compared to traditional Punjabi cuisine. The most popular method of cooking is using LPG gas stoves and traditionally, the household cooking is done mostly by women. The city has many restaurants that serve the local cuisine, Chinese food, South Indian food, fast food, pizza and ice cream. The prominent local restaurants include Chawla's 2, Cafe Aroma, Hot & Fresh Canadian pizza, Baskin-Robbins, Vadilal and Havmor. Chai, samosa, golgappa, dahi bhalla, aloo tikki, pakora, chow mein and kulcha are cheap fast-selling items here, that are sold by both unlicensed and licensed food vendors, including mobile vendors, though the hygiene of the food is sometimes questionable. Burgers have managed to creep in as a cheap street fare, though it is very different from a typical American burger. Muktsar does not have any significant presence of a major international food chain store or a fine dining restaurant. Entertainment and performing arts Entertainment avenues are virtually non-existent in Muktsar. The city is not exposed to western culture of nightclubs, pubs or clubs. In July 2015, the first multiplex was opened in Muktsar. With 3 screens and 590 seats, this cinema is being run as a franchise from SRS Cinemas by Rajpal theater. There are other 3 single-screen movie theaters in Muktsar - Cine Payal, Karnail and Ajit. There are no museums or performing arts centers in the city. Parks The major park in the city is Guru Gobind Singh Park, which has a sidewalk in a circular loop, that can be used for jogging. Mai Bhago park, located just behind Guru Gobind Singh Park, is a war memorial as a reminiscence for the battle of Muktsar in the memory of Mai Bhago and 40 Muktas. However, the park is ill- maintained. The city has another small park in the Mukt-e-minar complex, which houses the world's tallest khanda. It is located along the District Administrative Complex. Economy The city is virtually non-industrialized, lacking any significant industrial unit or factory. Before independence, Muktsar only had a few units producing small hand-held agricultural tools. Today, the only large scale industry near the city is Satia Paper Mills Limited, which is located about 7 km from the city center in Rupana village. The city has well-defined trade unions for most of the professions. The paper & card board workers union was officially registered in Muktsar in February 1986, the plumber union and also the cycle rickshaw puller union in September 1996 and mistri mazdoor (general manual labor) union in June 1998. Muktsar does not have any shopping mall and the retail industry is largely unorganized. Though three major retail chains have opened stores in Muktsar - Easyday, Vishal Mega Mart and Aadhar, the local population typically buys FMCG goods, groceries, fresh produce like vegetables, eggs, milk and meat from small unorganized retail vendors, including small shops and unlicensed mobile vendors, rather than from organized retail stores. Law and government Local self government The city is based on a municipal council form of government The Municipal Council is an institution which acts within the frame work set up by the Punjab Government and draws its powers from legislative enactment. It is managed by persons elected from among the public. In many respects, these institutions are independent but work under the oversight of the Punjab Government. The sources of income of the municipality include house tax, toll tax, water and sewerage rate, license fee, building fee, professional tax, entertainment tax, liquor tax and some minor taxes. The Muktsar municipality was constituted in April 1876 by the British Raj. The civic amenities provided by the municipal council include water supply, street lights, drainage, brick pavement of streets, cleanliness of the town and disposal of refuse. The municipal council maintains 28 miles (45 km) of roads. About 75 per cent of the town has sewerage facilities. Street lights have been installed in about 90 per cent of the town. The municipal council runs a public library and a reading room. It also maintains two parks. Administration The city's administration is managed by a Civil Sub Divisional Officer, reporting to the deputy commissioner of the Muktsar district. This position is responsible for co-ordinating the work of departments, the development activities, the revenue administration and the law and order of the city. Also, this position responds to the grievances of the public and attends to the problems arising out of natural calamities. The job profile for this position is also to act as the assistant collector under the Punjab Land Revenue Act and Punjab Tenancy Act. The profile is the appellate authority in cases decided by the subordinate revenue officers. A Sub-Divisional Magistrate placed by the State Government is the Executive Magistrate of Muktsar, who reports to the District Magistrate and is responsible for the maintenance of law and order within the limits of local jurisdiction, and also hears court cases. The other administrative positions include tehsildar, naib tehsildar, kanungo and patwari. Police The law and order situation of Muktsar is directly managed by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, also known as Assistant Commissioner of Police and is an officer of Indian Police Service cadre, who reports to the Senior Superintendent of the District Muktsar Police. Muktsar police, which forms a part of Punjab Police, functions from two police stations: Police Station - City and Police Station - Sadar. Places of interest Gurudwaras Gurudwara Tibbi Sahib, Muktsar The main gurdwara in Muktsar is Gurudwara Tuti Gandi Sahib, which was built by the first Sikh residents of the city that settled in the city in 1743. The gurdwara has a large holy pool, and the darbar sahib is located on the western bank of the pool. The building has been renovated several times. The holy shrine was built in the memory of the 40 muktas who died fighting for the 10th Sikh guru, Guru Gobind Singh. Tuti gandi, which literally translated means \\"broken ties\\", which is referred to Guru Gobind Singh nullifying the document that he was no longer the Guru of the 40 Sikhs, in the context of the battle of Muktar. Though the gurudwara attracts several visitors a day, there is a massive devotee footfall on Mela Maghi, celebrated on 13 January every year. The gurudwara also celebrates other religious occasions like the birthdays of Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Gobind Singh and the martyrdom of Guru Arjun Dev and Diwali, when the gurdwara is often illuminated. Shri Kalgidhar Niwas with forty rooms is available here for the devotees to stay during their visit. In the same premises, near the southeastern corner of the pool, is Gurudwara Tambu Sahib, which was built by Maharaja Mohinder Singh of Patiala. 50 metres away from the sarovar lies the Gurudwara Shahidganj Sahib. Built by Raja Wazir Singh of Faridkot, it is believed that it was here that Guru Gobind Singh cremated the bodies of the martyrs. Gurudwara Tibbi Sahib is also associated with the battle of Muktsar. It was this strategic spot that the guru chose to get a good view of the area, as that spot was located on a small hill, or a tibbi as called in Punjabi Located around 200 meters east of Gurudwara Tibbi Sahib, is the Gurudwara Rakabsar Sahib, where, according to Sikh chronicles, the stirrup, or rakab in Punjabi, of Guru Gobind Singh's horse snapped. Another gurudwara associated with Guru Gobind Singh in Muktsar is Gurudwara Sri Datansar Sahib, where he killed a Muslim enemy, when he was attacked while brushing his teeth with a datan, a traditional Indian toothbrush. Gurudwara Taran Taran Sahib, located on Muktsar-Bathinda road, is also associated with Guru Gobind Singh, where he halted while moving towards Rupana, after winning the battle of Muktsar. Hindu temples Muktsar has several Hindu temples, the prominent ones include Durga Mandir, Shiv Mandir on Kotkapura road and Mahadev Mandir. The city also has one Digamber Jain Temple located in Rambara Bazaar. Mosque The city has a historical mosque called Jamia Masjid. Also known as Angooran wali maseet, it was built in November 1894 by Nawab Maulvi Razav Ali Mian Badruddin Shah. It features minarets and domes. Mela Maghi An annual event celebrated in the month of January every year, the mela is organized as a tribute to the 40 Sikhs who died fighting for Guru Gobind Singh in the battle of Muktsar in 1705. Though the mela extends for more than a fortnight, the main event is held on 14 January, a day after Lohri, and is considered as one of the most important of all religious gatherings of the Sikhs. Sikhs consider it to be a pious occasion to take a dip in the holy pond of the Muktsar gurduwaras on that day. Despite the biting cold, devotees came in droves from Punjab and neighbouring areas, including Haryana and Rajasthan, to pay obeisance at Gurdwaras here. Apart from the religious activities, several political parties hold rallies in the city during the mela. The Mela celebrates the unique diversity of Punjabi tradition and culture in an ambiance representing the ethos of rural India. Several temporary stalls line the road selling a variety of wares from kirpans to kitchen-ware to refurbished clothing. A makeshift amusement park is created, which features circus, giant wheel, merry-go-round, wall of death, toy train and similar rides, along with food stalls. Mukt-e-minar In May 2005, the then chief minister of Punjab, Amrinder Singh, inaugurated Mukt-e-minar, which is the world's tallest khanda. An 81-foot double edged sword shaped structure, it has 40 rings around it, symbolizing the 40 Sikhs that died during the battle of Muktsar. The memorial was dedicated to the 300 year anniversary of the last Mughal-Khalsa battle, where the Khalsa forces defeated the enemy. Sports Muktsar has a stadium called Guru Gobind Singh Stadium, with the facilities for athletics, tennis, basketball, football and kabaddi. The stadium is replete with a standard 400m competitive running track. The stadium also houses a large indoor sports stadium nearby, though presently it is in a state of neglect. Education The city's public school system, managed by the Government of Punjab, is administered by Punjab School Education Board, through government schools. The city also has a large number of private schools affiliated with Central Board of Secondary Education, Punjab School Education Board and Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations. Muktsar has a number of colleges for higher education offering degrees in the major streams like arts, commerce, science, law and medical science. Notable colleges in Muktsar include Government College and Bhai Maha Singh College of Engineering. The city also has a Punjab University regional centre.

At that time Mulagumoodu was an abandoned village, probably an abode of brigands.It was not a catholic village, though there were some Christians.There was nothing externally attractive.But Fr.Victor experienced an attraction to be there.He got the necessary permission from his Bishop and started work putting his trust in Him who had called him. The year 1888 was a year of calamities for the whole Mulagumoodu and for the neighbouring areas. The people had fallen in the grip of the epidemics of Cholera. It was really horrible. We see everywhere the dead or the dying. So many people died. Every where weeping and lamentations. We can hear nothing but the sound of spades digging the tombs. The epidemics increased the number of orphans for the orphanage with the obligation of finding out new means to maintain them all. In the year 1862 Fr.Victor bought 40 acres(16 hectares) of land to the Mulagumoodu Parish and started his development activities. He built churches, schools, orphanages for boys and girls. He laid the foundation stone for the construction of Mulagumoodu convent in the year 1891 and was completed on 1897. He also gave training to youth in masonry, carpentry and blacksmith works. He also started tile works which dominated the market in those days, which provided job opportunities to many. The Founder of the Convent of the Sisters, Fr.Victor arranged to have the services of the Canonesses St. Augustine of Yper, Belgium. The two volunteers, Mother Marie Louise De Meester and Mother Marie Urusule came to Mulagumoodu on 07-11-1897 from Belgium and took possession of the newly constructed Convent by Fr.Victor at Mulagumoodu. The two Sisters from Belgium founded ICM at Mulagumoodu having their headquarters at Trichy.ICM Sisters have been doing commendable socio and economic development activities among the people of Mulagumoodu and its surrounding villages.

Albania Taxicab in Albania In Tirana, the capital city, they are all painted in yellow, with various signs on the roof. The official taxis have yellow plates with red text. The Albanian word is \\"taksi\\", but most of the signs are in English. Lately the law has required taxi drivers to buy cars that are less than 10 years old. 90% of taxicabs are private: there are only two companies operating and they only operate in Tirana. Apart from these two companies, very few drivers use taximeters. Argentina Chevrolet Corsa taxi In Argentina taxicabs are called 'taxis'. In the capital Buenos Aires (and Rosario and others) the colours of the taxis are black, with yellow roofs, as a reference to the many Peugeot 504 which served as taxis in the 1980s, which used the same paint layout. The licensing is a central government function. Today, most models are Chevrolet Corsa and Fiat Siena, with retrofitted or factory-built NGV power plants which means much lower fuel costs than gasoline. Australia Ford Falcon taxi in Perth, Western Australia Australia used horse-drawn taxis once cities were established (as had been used in Europe in the early 19th century). Motor vehicle taxis were introduced into Australia not long after they were put into service in the United Kingdom and Europe. In 1906, Sydney inaugurated motorised taxis and in approximately 1907 so did Queensland, and other states followed soon after. The progress through the years included many types of tourers from the 1910 era until the late 1920s, with British and American cars predominating. Sedans were added during the late 1920s and included similar makes of vehicles. This was the case with all cars being imported into Australia until World War II began. American cars proved more suitable to Australian motoring conditions especially for taxis. General Motors Corporation built thousands in Australia, as did the other American companies including Ford Motor Company and Chrysler. The release of hybrid cars has been slow, but is beginning to replace LPG taxis. Bangladesh Toyota Premio taxi in Dhaka, Bangladesh Taxis in Bangladesh are generally Toyota Corolla (E160)s, Toyota Premios or Toyota Allions in yellow.

China Different vehicles are used throughout China due to various provinces/cities' taxi company choices: In China, taxicabs are very common throughout the country. Tencent's Dididache is a smartphone application especially designed for Meizu, Zte and Huawei which matches passengers and willing taxi drivers who are situated in close proximity. For passengers, a list of nearby taxicabs is created via GPS, and a signal is sent out indicating an expression of interest. Conversely, for taxi drivers with the app installed on their phones, the GPS system quickly lists and localizes nearby potential clients; and once a match is created, the taxi can efficiently pick up awaiting passengers. Dididache is a dominant player in China's taxi-hailing arena, with a market share exceeding 60% and service extending to 32 cities including the Tier-1 conurbations of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Dididache in 2014 has 40 million registered users, a doubling from 2013's user base; and every month, more than 21 million cab rides are booked through the service, or 700,000 bookings per day. Additionally, from the taxicab perspective, Dididache already has an extensive user base of taxi drivers of more than 350,000 vehicles across China. Even in very small villages, there will be cars for hire. In smaller towns and villages, taxicabs are generally unregulated and may consist of a bike with a carriage, or more commonly, motorcycles with extensions that allow three people to sit in the rear. Even in large cities, taxicabs are generally very lax forms of transportation. Taxicabs in Shanghai may not refuse to go to any destination within the city. Relative to the west, taxicabs are very cheap, and in smaller areas the fare may be 1 yuan per person. Colombia Kia Picanto taxicab in Bogota, Colombia In Colombia taxicabs are yellow in most of the cities. The most common taxicab around is the Hyundai Atos, praised for its fuel economy. Other similar, popular taxicab vehicles include the Chevrolet Matiz and the Kia Picanto Egypt Hyundai Elantra taxicab in Cairo Chery A5 Cairo taxi Taxicabs are common in Egypt, particularly in the larger cities. The taxi system is highly decentralized, with the cab generally belonging to the driver and operated as a private business by him. Consequently, there is some variation in the types of cars used as taxis, although the Tofa≈ü ≈ûahin (including the licensed version produced by Nasr) and Hyundai Accent predominate. Drivers must obtain a taxi license from the government, generally through the offices of the Governorate in which they are based; however, taxis are permitted to operate between cities. Drivers must also paint their cars according to a livery unique to each governorate, including painting the license plate number of the cab on its doors in both Arabic and English. The traditional liveries of Cairo (black and white) and Alexandria (yellow and black) are well-known to all Egyptians and indeed across the Arab world from their appearance in Egyptian film and television. Meters are technically required by Egyptian law, but they generally go unused and in many cases do not even work. The prime exception is in Cairo, where a new class of taxi with a different livery (white with a black checkered band around the middle) have electronic meters installed and used. In most other cases, the price of a journey is generally determined through negotiation or bargaining between the passenger and driver, either just after the cab is hailed or just after the destination is reached. Many if not most Egyptian taxi drivers have some education and frequently work in white collar professions that nevertheless come with low pay (generally low- level government work, including education); taxis are a common source of supplemental income for many Egyptian families. Consequently, taxi drivers are a common source of vox populi for foreign media sources. Eritrea In Eritrea all taxis are yellow. In the capital, Asmara, they are all new yellow Kia, Toyota and Mercedes Benz. There are often five passenger seats. The taxis are owned by the same company all over Asmara. The taxi traffic starts slowing down after 9 pm in the northernmost part of the city's suburbs, but the inner city and southern side of the town have a lot of taxis. The taxis in Massawa are often large like mini buses, but are still taxis. They are also yellow. Finland Skoda Superb Combi taxi in Finland After World War II, Russian cars, especially Pobeda and Volga, dominated the taxi market in Finland for several years. In the late 1950s the import restriction on cars was lifted for taxi operators, which made it feasible to import western cars in larger numbers. By the end of 1960s Mercedes-Benz in particular had gained a dominant position, accounting for up to half the taxi stock, and the Finnish distributor of Mercedes, VEHO, even has a separate taxi sales department. Mercedes has remained the archetypal taxi ever since, although other makes such as Volvo (especially estate models) and the VAG brands are also common. Taxis in Finland do not have to be liveried in any particular colour or pattern. They are recognisable from the yellow 'TAKSI' sign on the roof, which is illuminated when the taxi is available for hire. Taxis mainly gather at special taxi ranks, rather than being 'hailed'. Customers either walk to the taxi rank and take the first available taxi from the front of the queue, or wait at the rank for a taxi to appear. One can also order a taxi by telephone etc. to a specific address. France Citroen taxicab in France The first horse-drawn forerunners of taxis appeared on Parisian streets in 1637. France was one of the first countries to use modern taxis‚Äîthat is, gasoline-powered vehicles with fare meters in 1899. New York's first taxis were imported from France in 1907, and taxis were famously used for troop transportation during the First Battle of the Marne. Within last two decades a big part of taxis in France were Peugeot cars among them we can find the mythic Peugeot 406 used in \\"Taxi\\" the French action-comedy film. Germany Mercedes-Benz E-Class taxi in Germany An important event in the history of the taxi was the invention of the taximeter by Friedrich Wilhelm Gustav Bruhn, a German engineer, in 1891. The Daimler Victoria the world's first meter-equipped (and gasoline-powered) taxicabwas built by Gottlieb Daimler in 1897, and began operation in Stuttgart that same year. In Germany, taxis were required by law until November of 2005 to be light ivory, RAL number 1015). Before 1971, they were required to be black. There is a small illuminated \\"TAXI\\" sign on the roof of the car (on when available, off otherwise). Typically the taxicabs are Mercedes-Benz E-Class and S-Class, along with other, mainly German, brands. Taxicabs are either sedans, station wagons, or MPVs. Common station wagon taxicabs include Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Among the MPVs, Mercedes-Benz B-Class, and Mercedes-Benz Vianos are common. Most taxicabs have automatic transmission, and some have navigation systems on board. Fares are usually close to those of other western European countries;Taxis fares comparison (2014) however, in Berlin taxis have a special low fare (‚Ç¨4) called \\"Kurzstrecke\\" for distances less than 2 km. Except in Portugal, in other western European capitals the minimum taxi fare usually costs double; nevertheless, the convenience and high quality of public transportation in most German cities eliminates the need for taxicabs. Although allowed, \\"Street Hail\\" is relatively uncommon in Germany because cabs rarely circle the cities when vacant. Because there are relatively few customers, most cabs return to assigned waiting stations and are called on demand. Although this has proven to be more economic for cab drivers, it is considered very inconvenient for commuters because taxis include the ride from the waiting station to the pickup point in the fare. Guyana In Guyana, any vehicle registered with the first letter as \\"H\\" is a taxi. There are over 20,000 registered taxis in the country. Some cars are not registered to be taxis but still operate as them. They are called Private Hire cars and operate illegally in the country. They have \\"P\\" plates and are not authorised to operate as taxis. As of 2010 taxis are required to be painted yellow. They also have a sticker on the rear bumper that reads Hackney Carriage. Hong Kong Nissan Cedric taxi in Hong Kong Toyota Comfort taxi in Hong Kong Toyota JPN taxi in Hong Kong During the early colonial times, sedan chairs were the only form of public conveyances. Public chairs were licensed, and charged according to tariffs which would be prominently displayed.A Hong Kong Sedan Chair, Illustrations of China and Its People, John Thomson 1837-1921, (London,1873-1874) Chair stands were found at all hotels, wharves, and major crossroads. Their numbers peaked in about 1920.Nury Vittachi, Riding out the rickshaw days , The Standard, March 28, 1998 The pulled rickshaw, first imported from Japan in 1870, was a popular form of transport for many years, peaking at more than 7,000 in the early part of the 20th century. The rickshaw and sedan chair vied for customers depending on their budget, haste, or terrain to be negotiated. The rickshaw was more rapid, but was not suited to climbing the steep terrain of Hong Kong Island. Rickshaws' popularity waned after World War II. There were about eight in 1998, and only four left in 2002. The last sedan chair was reportedly abandoned in 1965; and the rickshaws have disappeared since the ferry's closure at the end of 2006. The earliest modern taxi service was first officially recorded by the government in 1947 with 329 cars.HK Gov. \\"Taxi Annual Traffic report. \\", Transport Department, HK Government, Retrieved on 2007-02-23 In Hong Kong today, there are three types of taxis, painted in different colours, serving different parts of the territory. The most common one, which is painted in red. The red taxi serves throughout Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. Green taxis serve the New Territories and light blue taxis serve Lantau Island. Taxis pick up passengers from streets, or by radio-dispatch by phone. Fares are charged according to the distance measured by meters. Surcharges include tolls, luggages and pets. Hungary Skoda Octavia taxi in Hungary In Budapest, the capital of Hungary from 2013 every taxis must be painted in yellow. India In India, taxicabs have a yellow-black livery. The newer taxis are white. Taxis and all other commercial vehicles have a yellow number plate so charging taxes and toll in highways is easier for the officials. Depending on the city/state, taxis can either be hailed, booked through applications or can be hired from taxi-stands. In cities such as Bangalore, taxis need to be hired from taxi stands or online, whereas in cities like Kolkata and Mumbai, taxis can be hailed on the street. There are additional surcharges for luggage, late-night rides and toll taxes are to be paid by the passenger. Thanks to the booming economy but due to disparities in income many types of taxis have come up. For example, in Delhi there are 5 types of taxi. Auto rickshaws (most affordable), Normal Taxis, Radio Cabs, White Taxis and Tourist Taxis. In areas like Noida and Gurgaon auto rickshaws are banned thus giving the taxis a monopoly. Chandigarh also has a well established system of modern radio cabs. By Government regulations all taxis are required to have a fare-meter installed. Taxis face stiff competition from auto rickshaws but in some cities, for example Mumbai, auto rickshaws are banned in the main city district, thus giving taxis a monopoly. This monopoly directly affects the kind of cars used in India as cabs as well as the kind of economical and transport conditions. Indonesia Toyota Limo, a stripped down version of the Vios operating as a regular taxi in Jakarta. Nissan Cedric Diesel (Y31) was the first Silver Bird executive taxi in Jakarta. Taxicabs began to be popular in Jakarta from the early 1970s with cars such as the Datsun 220C, Holden Torana, and Toyota Corona. Smaller cars, for example the Toyota Corolla, and various types of Datsun, were also used from mid-1970s to late 1980s. In the 1970s, taxicabs were in various colors, although at that time mostly yellow, and a major operator ran light blue taxicabs. The main vehicle replacement for most taxicab operators was in mid-1980s when they replaced their old fleet with Nissan Stanza 1.6 T11. With the exception of the popular light blue, all other operators had their Stanzas painted yellow. Due to poor sales in the private car market, but good fuel economy and reliability, Holden Gemini diesel cars were used as taxicabs during the 1980s. The same happened to Nissan Sunnys and Ford Lasers from the late 1980s to late 1990s. Since the color of most reliable taxicab company in Jakarta is medium blue metallic (previously light blue), few other operators copied their color, and even the shape of the roof sign. This could mislead someone when hail the taxicab on the street. Although most taxicabs are blue, there are also painted in any color depends on the operators. The new taxicabs in Jakarta are mostly Toyota Limo, which is a lower spec of Toyota Vios. Before the introduction of Limo in 2004, the most popular taxi was Toyota Soluna, which based on the 1995 Toyota Tercel. The Solunas and the older variants of Limo are now used by cheaper taxicabs. Other cars also used as taxicabs are Hyundai Excel, Ford Laser, and Kia Rio. Only one operator ran the Nissan Sunny 1.6 Neo (N16) and later replaced by the newer Nissan cars; the Tiida Latio and the Almera. By 2014, the Nissan Almera (N17) is also commonly used for taxicabs ran by several operators. Honda Mobilio 7-seater is also used since 2015. There are also executive taxicabs; these are black Nissan Cedric Y31 and Toyota Crown Comfort, and recently a W203 Mercedes-Benz C-Class, a W211 Mercedes-Benz E-Class, a Toyota Alphard, a Hyundai Sonata, and a Nissan Elgrand. Since the Soluna and followed by the Vios-based Limo, Toyota's small sedans are used for regular taxicab services in Indonesia. However, in the executive taxicab segment, only few Toyota Crown Comfort. In 2007, the executive fleet saw the arrival of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, followed by the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and the Toyota Alphard in 2009. An executive taxicab operator has added the Volkswagen Caravelle to its fleet, and soon the Hyundai Starex. As of early 2016, various taxi firms also began to use the Toyota Avanza mini MPV as an alternative fleet, particularly in Sumatra, Borneo, Central Java and East Java regions. Batam The taxicabs in Batam consist of mostly facelifted Toyota Corolla GLi E110 sedans. Other popular models include the Nissan Sunny, Mitsubishi Lancer, and Toyota Crown Comfort. Licensed taxis have yellow license plates affixed, whereas illegal ones use white plates. Ireland A Taxi in Ireland In the Republic of Ireland, the term taxi is reserved for vehicles that may pick up on streets and where the fare is determined by a meter. Taxi vehicles do not have to be a particular colour but all carry a distinctive roofsign with the licence number prominently displayed, some with the Irish word TACSA√ç instead of the usual \\"TAXI\\", also a sticker or stickers that determine their boundaries by county, these stickers carry a letter or letters that reflect the number plate county code (e.g. D=Dublin, MH=Meath etc.) (for full list see vehicle registration plates of Ireland). And as of January 2013, a green and blue \\"TAXI\\" sticker is required on the front doors. In September 2006 a nationwide taxi fare system was introduced so that charges no longer depend on the county or city council area. The term hackney is used in Ireland to refer to a service which can only carry passengers from a pre- booked destination (or the hackney company's office) to another destination, similar to a minicab in Britain. Such vehicles are indicated by a small yellow plate above the registration plate with the word Hackney and the licence information. They normally operate for an agreed fare. Both taxis and hackneys are licensed by the National Transport Authority.NTA, Ireland Israel Sherut taxi Mercedes-Benz taxi in Israel There are two taxi systems in Israel, with one operating as a standard taxi service and the other (taxi - sherut) as a cross between a taxi and a private bus system. The latter tends to run longer journeys or particular routes and is effectively a shared taxi - hence set pick up and set down locations but also potentially picking up or dropping off anywhere en route. Although fares are officially meter-based, it is quite common to agree the fare in advance with the driver. They have a directory guide for prices and will show the estimated alternative to the meter price, either to be accepted, negotiated or rejected by the traveler if the meter is preferred. The wisdom of the choice may be based on time of day and traffic and whether you have bags etc. which could cost more on the meter as each piece adds a set amount. Either way the eventual fare is not usually significantly different so many Israelis choose the meter without a thought. Tipping is not required but rounding up is common. Italy Taxicab in Italy In Italy, taxicabs are white (previously they were yellow, in the 1950s and 1960s they were green-black or red), with a small illuminated \\"TAXI\\" white (previously red) sign on black background on the roof of the car. There are 25,186 taxis in the country (1 out of 2,412 people). Mercedes-Benz, Ford and Fiat models are common. MPV or minivan taxicabs are also prevalent such as the Fiat Multipla, Fiat Ulysse, Fiat Doblo and Ford Galaxy. There is at present time a harsh political struggle between people who advocate deregulation of taxi licences and those who are against it. Japan Taxi in Tokyo.(Toyota Prius V) Taxicabs at Sendai Sta. parked in the taxipool In most parts of Japan, there are many taxicabs of various colors and styles. Japan has no limitation in taxicab design, so each taxicab company adopts their own design, but owner-driver taxicabs use a prescribed design. In Osaka, most taxicabs are black because they are also used as limousine taxis. Lithuania Taxi in Lithuania In Lithuania taxicabs are called 'Taksi', all of them have a small, yellow illuminated cylinder-like \\"Taksi\\" sign on the roof of the car and black-yellow square lines on the sides.

Mexico Taxi in Mexico City with the Mexican pink and white design in use since 2014 In Mexico City, according to Mexican legislation introduced in 2001, public taxicabs (in contrast with private taxicabs, or 'taxis de sitio') must be 4-door, painted in red with a white roof, and almost all new taxis are Nissan Tsurus. Before 2001 most taxicabs were green Volkswagen Beetles with a white roof. They had the front passenger- seat removed in order to ease entry for passengers. At the moment, the taxi population is in a transition period, with both types in use.Taxicabs in Mexico City Originally taxis were yellow with a white roof, until they were changed in the mid-1990s (allegedly because yellow was the official colour of the Partido de la Revoluci√≥n Democr√°tica, which at the time was competing for the newly created Mexican District gobernancy with the Partido Revolucionario Institucional, which is mostly identified with green colour; officially it was to identify green taxicabs as environmentally-friendly 'ecol√≥gicos', even though they were the same polluting Volkswagen Beetles). As in most of the world, a special license must be obtained in order to run a taxicab. Morocco Fiat Siena taxicab in Tangier Since 2014 the Moroccan taxi industry is living major changes.

New Zealand Green Cabs in Queenstown, New Zealand In New Zealand, as in Australia, Holden Commodores and Ford Falcons were the traditional taxicab of choice. However, in the last decade large front wheel drive V6 models such as Toyota Avalons, Nissan Maximas and Toyota Camrys predominated. In the main centres these are now being replaced by lower carbon-emission vehicles, primarily the Toyota Prius, and occasionally the Skoda Octavia. Norway Mercedes-Benz E-Class taxi in Norway In Norway, the end of year 2009 roster showed that 41.9% of the 8961 taxicabs were from Mercedes-Benz, and several manufacturers that can offer a diesel-engined executive car are represented. 91.6% of Norwegian taxis are equipped with diesel engines. Among \\"maxitaxis\\" (minibuses operating as taxis), Mercedes-Benz vehicles such as the Mercedes- Benz Sprinter constitute 70% of the fleet. Taxicabs are usually distinguished by small company logo stickers on bonnet and doors and an illuminated \\"taxi\\" sign on the roof (the internationally recognised word taxi is almost always used, rather than the Norwegian word drosje; the term maxitaxi is used informally to refer to minibuses used as taxis). There is no particular colour for taxicabs though various shades of black and silver are the most popular choices of colour. Fares are always metered, although there may be fixed tariffs for certain journeys such as airport-to-city-centre. In 2011, the most popular models of vehicles used as taxis were the Mercedes E-class, Toyota Prius, and Volvo V70, accounting for more than half of the taxi fleet. The Mercedes-Benz E-classes is the most common new cab, with the hybrid Toyota Prius in second place, the latter having increased its sales due to the tax regime favoring low carbon dioxide emissions. Oman Toyota Corolla taxicab in Oman Taxicabs in Oman are usually with Orange panels and mostly models of Toyota or Nissan. The Number plate will be Red in colour & start with K, KA, KB ( for saloon ) and KK ( for vans) They do not have any meters installed. Fare is generally decided by bargaining with the driver, though most commuters have a good idea of what can be considered a reasonable price. The rider may choose to have the taxi \\"shared\\", or \\"engaged.\\" In an engaged taxi, the driver will not take any more passenger (as opposed to a shared taxi). Usually drivers charge much more to have the taxi engaged, sometimes as much as 8-10 times the price of a shared taxi. In a shared taxi, the driver will usually get more people who need to go along the same way. Due to low costs of fuel and fairly high purchasing power parity in Oman, taxicabs are extremely cheap when compared to other parts of the world, even in the engaged mode. A variation of the shared taxi also exists. These are usually 12-seater Toyota vans. These taxis ply along a fixed route, stopping mostly at bus stops to pick and drop passengers. Passengers usually hop onto the taxi that is headed towards their destination. To attract more passengers, taxis stick to highways and main roads. If one wishes to go towards a place not along the main road, it is generally more economical to use a shared van to commute between two bus stops, and then switch over to another taxi headed for the destination, as opposed to taking the regular taxi to commute between the 2 places.

Regulated official taxicabs, identifiable by their yellow livery (from the 1st of July all taxis in Moscow must be painted in RAL 1006 (maize yellow), are relatively few in Moscow, but since any car can be used as a taxi.\\"Transportation in Moscow /Getting Around\\", Way to Russia, 2004 There is a long tradition of so-called (in English) 'gypsy-cabs' that comprise most of the city's fleet.\\" Moscow women in fear of serial killer\\", Julius Strauss, The Daily Telegraph, 3 September 2003 These are private motorists, typically in Lada 1300s or similar vehicles, who will pick up passengers in the street. For some drivers gypsy-cab work is their main source of income, whereas many others will cruise around after finishing their day jobs. Some Muscovites who are not driving specifically for hire will nevertheless pick up paying passengers travelling in the direction of their own destination. Gypsy-cabs can be hailed quickly in central Moscow by stepping up to the curb and raising a hand.\\"Destroying Moscow\\", Chris Stephen, Axess Magazine, 2007 Driver and passenger will negotiate a price through the front window; though occasionally the driver does not wish to go to the requested destination or the passenger and driver cannot agree a mutually acceptable price, in which case the car may leave and the passenger is able to try his luck with another one. While there is obviously a risk of crime in getting into a stranger's car in any city, using gypsy-cabs in Moscow is seen as relatively safe, though the British Embassy in the city officially discourages the practice.\\"Britain in Russia - Services\\" , British Embassy, 19 June 2007 In contrast to taxicabs, pre-booked private-hire vehicles are readily available in Moscow on a conventional commercial basis. Traditional cabs in the Western sense are becoming more and more common, but remain very expensive in comparison to the gypsy cabs. In Russia there also exists a luxury taxi service where taxis are Maybachs and TechArt Magnums (tuned Porsche Cayennes).

ComfortDelGro was the only one to use Uber until Uber's operations in Southeast Asia merged into Grab, where all other companies are still using it. ComfortDelGro also plans to tie up with Go-Jek.ComfortDelGro worry about Go-Jek In the mid-1960s, the first taxicab company had their vehicles painted black with a yellow roof top. The model was a Mercedes Benz 220S, followed by the Austin Cambridge A60 which lasted till the mid-1970s. By then, the most popular taxicabs in Singapore were painted pale light blue. From the early 1990s many new taxis had new liveries, and the biggest taxicab company ComfortDelGro repainted its taxis in dark blue colour with a new logo. Early examples used the Volga Gaz 24, Isuzu Florian and Morris Marina which were replaced by the Nissan Cedric (Datsun 220C Diesel) and the Toyota Crown Diesel were the most common taxicab models in the 1970s and 1980s. The smaller Toyota Corona CT191 marked the late 1980s to mid-1990s era. Currently, Hyundai Ioniq and Hyundai i40 are the most flagship taxis in Singapore. In the mid 90s, Mercedes-Benz E-Class cabs were introduced as a premium service catered to the airport & hotels. Mercedes-Benz V-Class dubbed 'Maxicabs' followed soon after to cater to those who has greater demands or for private event limousine bookings. Various models were used, such as Hyundai Azera, Chrysler 300, Skoda Superb and Volkswagen Touran. There are six taxicab companies in Singapore and four private hire car companies in Singapore.

South Korea Hyundai Sonata taxicab in South Korea Kia K5 taxicab in South Korea There is an extensive taxicab system, with about 70,000 in Seoul alone. Altogether there are about 250,000 taxis in the whole of the country. In cities such as Seoul and Busan, taxicabs are very common. There are three types: an \\"ordinary\\" (ilban;ÏùºÎ∞ò) taxi; a \\"model\\" (mobum;Î™®Î≤î) taxicab, which is painted black and is bigger and much more expensive; and a 'taxicab for the handicapped' (jang-e-in call taxi;Ïû•Ïï†Ïù∏ÏΩúÌÉùÏãú), which is a yellow painted van for the handicapped people who are living around Seoul. There are also two types of taxicab drivers' license: all taxicab drivers start driving their taxicab as employees in the taxicab companies, and these taxicabs that belong to a company are called 'corporate' (bubin;Î≤ïÏù∏) taxicabs. After years of service in the taxicab company, drivers get a license which allows them to purchase their own vehicle and drive it as a self-employed driver, and the taxicabs they then drive are called 'individual' (gaein;Í∞úÏù∏) taxicabs. For 'ordinary' taxicabs, there is an extra 20% increase in fare after midnight, but this does not apply to the 'model' taxis. Most 'ordinary' taxis are silver or white in colour. Virtually all South Korean taxicabs are South Korean car models, and meter fares start at 3,800 South Korean won. The fares are much cheaper than in major cities in Europe and North America, and no extra fares are charged for luggage. All taxicabs are labelled in Korean with a sign 'individual' (Í∞úÏù∏), 'model' (Î™®Î≤î), or the name of the company if the taxicab belongs to a taxicab company, and have a half-sphere on top of a half-pyramid, or to a lesser degree a silhouette of a traditional Korean gate attached on the roof and labelled \\"TAXI\\". Spain thumb In Spanish cities, as well as in small and large towns, taxicabs always have a meter. The models that can be used must be homologated previously for this function by the local authorities, and they are always four-door sedans or minivans. Regarding the livery, each town and city designates the colour of their taxis, but in the overwhelming majority, it is white, usually with some kind of colour detail and/or local symbol on the doors. For example, in Madrid (and also in Almer√≠a), taxicabs are white with a red diagonal stripe going through the front doors; in Seville, they are white with a diagonal yellow stripe down the rear doors; in Bilbao, white with a horizontal red stripe on the front doors, etc. A notable exception is Barcelona, where taxicabs are fully black, except the doors and the boot lid, which are painted yellow. Sweden Taxicabs in Stockholm In Sweden, most taxis are painted black, yellow or dark blue, to some extent depending on the company's guidelines. There are many taxi companies, from big networks to one- car companies. License plates on Swedish registered Taxis are yellow and all end with a \\"T\\" in a slightly smaller size than the other characters on the license plate. Tariff varies, but all taxis must have a taximeter and a price comparison chart visible in the car. Taiwan Toyota WISH taxi in Taiwan Taxicabs in Taiwan are yellow. The Road Traffic Security Rules (zh:ÈÅìË∑Ø‰∫§ÈÄöÂÆâÂÖ®Ë¶èÂâá) require drivers to be at least 20 years old and have occupational driver licenses. When drivers reach 60 years old, they may continue to drive taxis until 65 years old provided they pass annual physical examinations. Taxis in larger cities are widely metered with fares generally based on distances and now more commonly with surcharges for times in slow and stopped traffic. At Lunar New Year, the most important Taiwanese holiday, surcharges may also be payable. Historically whenever major crimes have occurred, many people, especially women, have felt less confident riding taxis due to safety and security concerns, causing taxi drivers to carry even fewer passengers. After two major murders in late 1996, Yao Kao-chiao, the director-general of the National Police Agency, said that his daughter would not dare to ride taxis.\\"Chen opens fire with ads\\", Taipei Times Many taxi drivers considered his speech impacting and discriminating against them.Chinese information Thailand Bangkok brightly coloured taxi - Toyota Corolla Altis Bangkok bicoloured taxi - Toyota Fortuner Taxis are widely available in Bangkok and come in many different colours (because of different groups or companies). Most are metered. The colour of Bangkok taxi are in various colours including single-colour, bi-colour and single-colour with strip. The single-colour are a company taxi, personal taxi in cooperation or alliance and rental company taxi. These colour including bright green, bright sky blue, red, orange, yellow, blue, pink, purple, violet and tan. The bi-colour are in 3 kinds including yellow+green, red+blue and yellow+orange. The yellow+green are the personal private taxi. The red+blue are the rental taxi. The yellow+orange are the company taxi. In Bangkok, there are also Airport-taxi known as AOT Limousine. These cars are in silver. There are also taxi in Phuket, Chiang Mai, Samui, Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Udon Thani and Chonburi using the similar cars as in Bangkok. Trinidad and Tobago In Trinidad and Tobago the vehicles most commonly used as taxis are fifth-generation Nissan Cedrics, fifth and sixth-generation Nissan Laurels, 6th to 8th generation Toyota Crowns, Datsun Bluebirds and any other vehicles registered with an \\"H\\". However, in Trinidad, many cars still operate as taxicabs even without being registered. These \\"illegal\\" taxicabs are called \\"PH\\" or \\"P/H\\" taxis due to the fact that private cars are registered with a \\"P\\" for example, \\"PAU 6767\\". Private taxi companies are scarce and expensive, hence all taxis in Trinidad are both driver managed and driver operated. These privately owned taxis vary in colour and model, therefore one would almost never see a \\"yellow cab\\" in Trinidad and Tobago. Unlike Maxi taxis that are colour-coded to a specific area, taxicabs are not colour-coded. United Kingdom TX4 in London Mercedes-Benz S-Class taxicab elsewhere in the UK There is a mature system of taxicabs throughout the United Kingdom. In 2015, there were around 298,000 licensed drivers in England, of which 164,000 were private hire licenses, 62,000 were taxi licenses and 72,000 were dual licenses. All taxicabs are regulated with various degrees of sophistication. However, London's black cabs, known historically and legally as hackney carriages, are particularly notable for their iconic vehicles and the extensive training course (The Knowledge) required for fully licensed drivers. \\"Hackney carriages\\" ('Black cabs'; but they may be any colour) can be hailed in the street or hired from a taxicab rank. The term \\"Hackney carriage\\" can also be applied to standard passenger vehicles authorised by other Local Authorities to stop for passengers on a hail in the district. The fare is calculated on a taximeter that charges by both time and distance. There are two other types of hire vehicles which act as taxis; they are known as private hire vehicles: * A \\"private hire\\" taxi must be pre-booked, usually by telephone but also in some cases by e-mail or via in-car radio. Although not available to be hailed in the street, licensed private hire vehicles can offer a safe alternative to a 'Hackney Carriage'. The advantage of a private hire booking is that the journey is offered at a fixed price based only on mileage and not the variable time element of a taximeter found in a 'Hackney Carriage'; unless the private hire vehicle is fitted with a taximeter in which case this meter must be used to calculate the fare. In many areas private hire and hackney vehicles have different coloured taxi licence plates; and also it is common that hackney carriages must be a certain colour (usually black, hence the term \\"black cab\\"), while private hire taxis may be any colour but that prescribed for hackneys. * Chauffeur cars are a sub-set of private hire and historically have been mostly unlicensed. However, regulations now require them to be licensed. In Scotland most chauffeur/executive car operators along with nearly all stretched limousines are not still not licensed, and neither are their drivers. Generally a prestige type of car such as a Mercedes or BMW is operated where the passenger pays a premium but in return receives a higher level of comfort and courtesy from the driver who may at times wear a uniform. In Great Britain local authorities have the responsibility of regulating taxi and private hire vehicles together with their drivers. Licensed vehicles will normally have an ID plate at the rear, and sometimes also at the front, which shows information such as the licence number, expiry date and how many passengers it may carry. Luton is reported to have the highest number of taxicabs per head of population in the United Kingdom.\\"Luton South\\", UK Polling Report United States and Canada Nissan NV200 New York taxicab Toyota Prius V in Vancouver, British Columbia Throughout the United States (and Canada) there is a mature system of taxicabs. Most U.S. and Canadian cities have a licensing scheme which restricts the number of taxicabs allowed. These are sometimes called medallions or CPNC (Certificate of Public Necessity and Convenience). Often taxi businesses own their own cars, and the drivers are hired by the company as independent contractors. However, cabs can also be owned by separately-incorporated small businesses that subscribe to a dispatch service, in which case the company logo on the door is that of the dispatch association. A suburban taxi company may operate under several different names serving several adjacent towns. They often provide different phone numbers for each fleet, but they usually all ring into a central dispatch office. They may have subsidiary taxi businesses holding medallions in each town. Taxi companies also may run multiple businesses, such as non-medallion car services, delivery services, and school buses, for additional revenue, as the infrastructure required for maintaining, operating and dispatching the fleet can be shared. Sometimes theme or entertainment based taxis, like Funkmaster V's Uptown Cabs of Renown or Karaoke Kab, are popular Taxi services in the United States. Uruguay In Uruguay taxicabs are always called 'taxis' and not 'cabs'. In Uruguay's capital Montevideo the colours of the taxis are yellow and white. Licensing is a central government function. Soviet Union GAZ-24 ¬´taxi¬ª edition In the last years of the Soviet regime, the cars most used as a taxi was the GAZ series vehicles. There are two modifications: the GAZ-24 \\"taxi\\" and old series GAZ-21 \\"taxi\\". Venezuela In Venezuela taxis are mostly white with the exception of luxury ones usually found on airports and luxury hotels, which are black. In Venezuela there is not such thing as a taximeter, nor any other way to know the fare. Due to this, it is common to discuss with the driver the fare before getting inside the cab. They tend to mislead tourists when coming to the country (especially Caracas) because the city doesn't have a numerical system for the street, building nor houses, making almost impossible to navigate through the city with just a map.

It is located around from Kolkata ‚Äî the capital of West Bengal. Kalyani is the administrative headquarters of Kalyani subdivision. It resides on the eastern banks of Hooghly River. During the period of World War II, Kalyani was the site of an American Airbase, known by the name of Roosevelt Town or Roosevelt Nagar. It was developed as a planned town in the early 1950s by the Government of West Bengal on behest of Bidhan Chandra Roy ‚Äì the second Chief Minister of West Bengal ‚Äì for hosting the Indian National Congress meeting and to accommodate the housing needs of the growing population of Calcutta. Kalyani, being a planned town, is characterized by underground sewage system, paved roads forming rectangular grids, tree-lined avenues and community parks. Kalyani Picnic Garden Kalyani has a dedicated industrial zone including Andrew Yule and Company, Kalyani Breweries (UB Group), Black Label beer and Dabur, TDK-EPCOS, though many of the industries have closed or stopped production.

The Bengal Cricket Academy and a stadium have been established by Cricket Association of Bengal in Kalyani for promotion and development of cricket. History Kalyani, located in Nadia district in the state of West Bengal, is a relatively young town. During the Second World War, Kalyani, was the site of an American military airbase, formed out of 45 villages in the district of Nadia. The military garrison town was named after the American president, Franklin D. Roosevelt as \\"Roosevelt Town\\" or \\"Roosevelt Nagar\\". Hangars and other reminders of the airfield are still visible in the 'A' Block and some areas around Kalyani University, whose buildings were built on or over the runways. After World War II, the American military left the base, and the airfield and hangars went into disuse. The development of modern Kalyani is credited to former Chief Minister of West Bengal, Bidhan Chandra Roy.

According to the Federal Constitutional Law, the Federal Assembly does not function as a legislative body; the two chambers enact legislation, and even amend the constitution, as strictly separate entities. Since 1945, the assembly has only met to swear the elected President of Austria into office. Tasks While during the pre-war First Austrian Republic, the Assembly convened to elect the Austrian president, a direct election was implemented by a 1929 amendment. This provision however did not become effective until 1951, when Theodor K√∂rner became the first president directly elected by the Austrian people. Since then, the principal responsibility is to convene for the ceremonial swearing- in of the president. It recently met at the inauguration of Alexander Van der Bellen's first term as Austrian President on 26 January 2017. In theory, the Federal Assembly also functions as an instrument of checks and balances; upon request by a two-thirds majority of the National Council, it may impeach the president before the Constitutional Court, or upon request by a two-thirds majority in the National Council decide on a referendum to have the president removed from office. The assent of the Assembly would also be required for the president's immunity against criminal prosecution to be withdrawn. Furthermore, it is also responsible for declaring war.

The South Skyline Historical Society also cites this name in describing the area. The ZIP Code is 94020 and the community is inside area code 650. History Middleton Tract was purchased by William Middleton sometime prior to 1923. Middleton received title to the great expanse of land (approximately or one \\"section\\") by way of several deeds. The tract is legally described as: the northeast quarter of section 5; the east half of the southeast quarter of section 5; the west half of section 4; all in township 8 south, range 3 west, M.D.B. & M. During the late 1880s portions of the land now known as the \\"Middleton Trac\\" were logged and the logs processed at the \\"Old Page Mill\\" site which is now located within Portola State Park. However much of the logging was perfunctory and many stands of old growth redwoods remained within the quarter section, including some very large trees in the Peters Creek drainage, and in several steep canyon areas. Some of these old growth trees exceed diameters at the base. Second growth trees soon sprouted from the logged stumps and today stand as very large trees many exceeding ten foot diameters at the base. The Middleton Tract was subdivided according to a plan created by Middleton and parcels were sold for summer residences. Included in Middleton's plan of development was a prohibition on logging and hunting. During the late 1920s and through the early 1950s a number of parcels were purchased by Stanford University luminaries and summer \\"cabins\\" were constructed. Among the owners of homes in the Middleton Tract was Frederick Terman. Terman founded the \\"towers of excellence\\" academic strategy that led Stanford to a leading role in engineering and electronics. J. Wallace Sterling, President of Stanford University from 1949 to 1968 built a rustic log cabin within the Middleton Tract as well as several university professors. Descendants of President Herbert Hoover also constructed several summer cabins within the tract. During the 1970s many of these summer homes became full-time residences and continue as full-time residences to this day. William Middleton died in 1962. While the was subdivided according to Middleton's plan into 80 parcels, many of the parcels, particularly those to the south and those on steep slopes remained undeveloped. Many of the undeveloped parcels were acquired by the Holmes Lumber Company in Santa Cruz County. Approximately were purchased and in 1986 Holmes Lumber applied for and received a \\"Timber Harvesting Permit\\" from the California State Board of Forestry allowing commercial logging activities on the property Many residents of the Middleton Tract, fearing the devastation of logging within their peaceful rural community formed the Greater Middleton Association(GMA)and proceed to file a lawsuit to enforce Middleton's Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&R;'s) reflected within the deeds to the parcels. Residents of the Middleton Tract Laura: A. Bryan, Timothy G. Geiser, and Malcolm McGilvray, Jr., were responsible for forming the GMA After a lengthy court trial in Superior Court of San Mateo County, Presiding JudgeFrank Piombo ruled in favor of the GMA and enforced the CC&R;'s. Holmes Lumber was permanently enjoined from logging activity within the Middleton Tract. Holmes Lumber Company appealed the lower court decision, but the Appellate Court upheld the lower courts decision as did the Supreme Court of the State of California. The commercial logging ban, under the legal concept of enforceable \\"equitable servitude\\" was upheld. An \\"equitable servitude\\" is a term used in the law of real property to describe a nonposseessory interest in land that operates much like a covenant running with the land. The case may be found at \\"Greater Middleton Assn. v. Holmes Lumber Co.(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 980 , 271 Cal.Rptr. 917\\" and was one of the first legal decisions concerning \\"equitable servitudes\\" in the past 70 years. This case is frequently sited in both California court decisions and in other states as well. Much of the history of the Middleton Tract can be found within the court filings of both litigants. Other notable personages who owned cabins in the Middleton Tract include famed Palo Alto Architect Birge Clark, Round Table Pizza founder William R. Larson, Stanford University Professor of Education Avlarez, and one of the Mozilla Foundation/Mozilla Corporation's founders Asa Dotzler. External links *PDF Oil field map of Oil Creek area.

Summary For the first time since season four, MADtv saw not just a change in cast members, but also a change in format. On the cast member front, Stephanie Weir (who actually left at the end of season ten, but was in a lot of pretaped season eleven sketches), Danielle Gaither, and Frank Caliendo were gone (with Gaither being fired by FOX while Weir and Caliendo left on their own accord). In their places, Frank Caeti and Nicole Randall Johnson were promoted to repertory status while Lisa Donovan was hired, starting with the fourteenth episode of the season, then fired by season's end. On the show's format front, the cold opening sketch was replaced by show announcer, Brian Fairlee, giving a preview of the sketches and guest stars that would appear in the episode. The sketches themselves became shorter, often shown in several parts so as to preserve the humor. A lot of political sketches centered on George W. Bush and his administration were nearly non-existent (barring the showing of a claymation short where Bush [voiced by Crista Flanagan] threatens to blackmail Santa Claus if Santa does not help him defeat his enemies). However, sketches with political undertones (such as \\"Steve Jobs' The iRack\\") and sketches that focused on the then-recent 2008 election, featuring Nicole Parker as Hillary Clinton and Keegan Michael- Key as Barack Obama would make up for the lack of Bush-related political satire. More focus was put on TV show and movie parodies, celebrity-based sketches, music video parodies, one-shot situational comedy sketches, and recurring character sketches. Animated sketches (mostly claymation, Monty Python-style cutout animation, and crude 2D Flash animation) also made a comeback after being phased out since season five (though seasons six, seven, eight, and nine had some semi-recurring and one-shot animated pieces, such as Shaq and the Super Lakers, Public Schoolhouse Rock, How Winona Ryder Stole Christmas, Chocolate Covered Peanuts, and Morbidly Obese Albert) with the appearance of the recurring sketch, \\"Celebrity Pets\\", a glut of non-sequitur shorts, \\"Weekly News with Toby\\" (featuring Frank Caeti giving a first grader's point of view of current events) and a three-part sketch called, Cartoon Network's Rejected Superheroes. Notable guest stars this season include: Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson, Eva Longoria, Seth MacFarlane (who, back when MADtv was starting out, was offered the chance to produce animated shorts for the show), the Los Angeles Kings, Tom Bergeron, Efren Ramirez, and Fred Willard.  Opening montage  The 12th season had a new title sequence with shots of the performers as they prepared for the show. The screen divides into three different live-action shots. When the theme music starts, the announcer introduces each cast member alphabetically. After the last cast member is introduced, the whole cast is shown in a live-action shot. The music stops and the title sequence ends with the phrase \\"You are now watching Mad TV\\". The sequence also has a new announcer, Brian Fairlee.

The area is about eight miles from downtown Los Gatos and nine miles from the Santa Cruz County community of Scotts Valley. Nearby Summit Road is roughly the dividing line between the counties: Santa Cruz County areas being generally west of Summit Rd. The Butano Fault (also known as the Butano Rift Zone), roughly follows Summit Road through the area. The ZIP code for post office boxes in Redwood Estates is 95044, although the city and ZIP code for street delivery is Los Gatos, 95033. Street addresses are usually five digits. The U.S. Geological Survey, National Geographic Names Database, lists the NAD27 coordinates of the community as . The community is inside area code 408 while communities further west (but outside Redwood Estates) are in the coastal area code 831. The architecture of homes in the community varies widely. The roads are paved, but narrow and winding when compared to modern urban streets. While area housing prices have been buoyed by rising real estate prices in Silicon Valley, the area is quiet and informal. There are few lawns: most homes have redwood duff in the front yard. Poison oak is evident in the area. There are very few storm drains, curbs, or sidewalks. Roads are framed by vegetation and wind along the contours of the area's hills. As the name implies, the area is populated by the towering redwood trees ubiquitous to the occasionally fog-shrouded areas of the California coast. Redwood roots seem to serve as informal speed bumps on many of the narrow community roads. Business occupancies in the community include: Nonnos Italian Cafe, 21433 Broadway; Redwood Estates Store, 20121 Broadway; Redwood Mutual Water Company on Madrone Dr.; Santa Clara County Fire Department Redwood Station at 21452 Madrone Dr.; and the Redwood Estates Post Office.

The area has a history with ties to railroading. Until the 1940s, a Southern Pacific Railroad line to Santa Cruz passed through Holy City east of Redwood Estates. A factor in the removal of the rail line was its high maintenance cost.

Plot As the story opens, a banker recalls the occasion of a bet he had made fifteen years before. Guests at a party that he was hosting that day fell into a discussion of capital punishment; the banker viewed it as more humane than life imprisonment, while a young lawyer disagreed, insisting that he would choose life in prison rather than death. They agreed to a bet: if the lawyer could spend fifteen years in total isolation, the banker would pay him two million rubles. The lawyer would have no direct contact with any other person, but could write notes to communicate with the outside world and receive whatever comforts he desired. Confined to a guest room on the banker's property, the lawyer suffers from loneliness and depression at first but eventually begins to read and study in a wide range of subjects. As the lawyer takes advantage of the solitude to educate and amuse himself in various ways over the years, the banker's fortunes begin to decline. The banker realizes that if he loses, paying off the bet will lead to bankruptcy. In the early hours of the day when the fifteen-year period is to expire, the banker resolves to kill the lawyer, but finds him greatly emaciated and sleeping at a table. A note written by the lawyer reveals that he has chosen to abandon the bet, having learned that material goods are fleeting and that divine salvation is worth more than money. Shocked and moved after reading the note, the banker kisses the lawyer on the head and returns to bed. When the banker wakes up later that morning, a watchman reports that the lawyer has climbed out the window and fled the property, forfeiting the bet. To prevent the spread of rumors, the banker locks the note in his safe. Characters There are two major characters featured in \\"The Bet\\": the lawyer and the banker, neither of which have official names in Chekhov's short story. The lawyer The lawyer is seen to be persistent, intelligent and self-motivating. He does not break down in the 15 years of imprisonment as the banker foretold. He is intelligent by the virtue of reading so many books, which reflects in his eagerness to associate with other men, rather than claiming the final prize. He starts as a young, impatient person, ready to spend 15 best years of his life for 2 million. His character of being a person with no interest in materialistic luxury is reflected when he renounces the 2 million and settles with just having proved his point. The banker The banker likes to be in a position of authority and likes to wield power over others, especially those who happen to disagree with him. The character changes drastically from the beginning of the story when he seems to be very free handed as he easily bets to pay two million and later, his lack of wealth drives him to dishonesty and plan for murder. This also signifies the weak character of the banker. He is very attached to the materialistic luxuries of life and values human life less than his luxuries as he plans on killing the lawyer. He plans on killing the lawyer for money and nothing but money changes his mind.

Founded in about the 1640s, the town was an important mercantile centre and port throughout its history. Mundra Port is the largest private port in India. History left Mundra was established by Bhojarajji I of Cutch State in 1640s. According to a legend, a Jain merchant Vardhaman Sheth approached Pir Hazrat Shah Murad Bukhari to pray for the -safety of his sinking cargo ship. Miraculously the ship was saved when Pir used his dhoti to prevent seawater from entering the ship. Vardhaman Sheth requested Pir to rename the town from Dumra to Muradabad in his respect but he declined as suggested to change to Munahara, . The name Mundra derived from Munahara. Many other miracles are attributed to the Pir. The legend also highlights a local custom among seafarers and merchants of visiting the Pir's shrine before going to sea. The town was fortified in 1728 by Devakaran Seth, Dewan of Deshalji I. The Old Mundra town was walled and fortified with the masonry from the ruins of the ancient town of Bhadreshwar, twenty seven kilometres to the north-east. It is mentioned in the Bantvijaya Chronicles and the masonry was transported as late as Vikram Samvat 1817 (1760). It is also mentioned by James Burgess. Colonel Holland who visited it 1840s mentions that the walled town was 1.5 miles in circumference and had 1500 houses. In 1755, Mundra was held and defended by Godji II when he was in revolt against his father Rao Lakhpatji. He imposed charges on merchant entering and exiting the town to raise the funds on the advice of Punja, his adviser. Lakhaptji was angered by the act and sent an army to the town. Godji fled to Morbi, strengthened his army and recaptured the town from his father. They compromised and Godji was allowed to keep Mundra and Punja was forced to retire. During Rao Rayadhan III's reign in 1778, he was forced to retire and the administration of the state was took over by Bar Bhayat ni Jamat (the council of twelve), a group of chiefs. A soldier called Fateh Muhammad rose to dominance in 1792. In 1801, Mundra was given by Fateh Muhammad to another chief called Dosal Ven. He later regained the town from him. Later it was given to Hansraj who also rose against him so he transferred it to his associate Muhammad Sota. In 1815, when held by Muhammad Sota, it was unsuccessfully attacked by Rao Bharmalji II. In 1818, it is said to have a population of 1200 souls and to have yielded a revenue of ¬£3000 (Rs 30,000). In 1855, the fort was in good repair and contained 1500 houses. In 1861, it was noted for petty carpets of stamped cotton. In 1879, there was a considerable trade with Kathiawar, Khambhat, Surat and Bombay. The chief exports were cotton, castor seed, pulse, wool and dyed cloth and the chief imports were metals, timber, grain, dates, grocery, and piece goods. In 1872, it had a population of 7952. The town was the base of many mercantile communities including Kutchi Oswal Vanias and Bhatias in the 18th to early 20th century. The importance of the town declined with the rise of Bombay (now Mumbai) and the construction of the Rajputana railway in the 1870s. Samundra Township After the independence of India in 1947, Cutch State acceded unto the dominion of India and was constituted an independent commissionaire, Kutch State. In 1956, Kutch State was merged with Bombay state, which in 1960 was divided into the new linguistic states of Gujarat and Maharashtra, with Kutch becoming part of Gujarat state. Mundra now falls under Kutch district of Gujarat. In 1994, the Mundra Port was announced at Mundra. The operation started in October 1998. In subsequent years, the port expanded rapidly resulting in rapid expansion of the town and population. During the January 2001 Gujarat earthquake, Mundra was the only place in the district of Kutch which was not affected by the devastation. Following the earthquake, the tax incentives were granted for setting up new industries in this district which led to the rapid industrialisation of this region. In 2014, Mundra Port surpassed Kandla in cargo handling and became the largest private port of India. 0n 29 August 2020, Mundra and Baroi Gram Panchayats were merged to form the Mundra-Baroi Municipality.

Economy Mundra Port Mundra thermal power station Mundra was well known for salt and spice trading in the past and now for tie-dye and block-printed textiles. The old harbor is virtually unusable today, and only small local fishing crafts navigate its silted waterways up the river. The main source of income for the local people is agriculture, horticulture and wage labour. Mundra has a Date Palm Research Station operated by Sardarkrushinagar Dantiwada Agricultural University converted from seed farm in 1969. Several people are employed in manufacturing companies, port and power stations. Mundra Port is the largest private port with multiproduct special economic zone owned and operated by Adani Ports & SEZ Limited. There are two thermal power stations adjacent to Mundra, Mundra Ultra Mega Power Plant operated by Tata Power and Mundra Thermal Power Station operated by Adani Power. This power station generates over 8,600 MW of electricity. The coal for the power plant is imported primarily from Indonesia. Source of water for the power plant is sea water from the Gulf of Kutch. Transport Mundra Airport is a private airport operated by Adani Group for scheduled as well as non-scheduled operations.

Early life Born in Wiesbaden, Hogefeld joined the RAF in the 1980s (around 1984) long after its founding members Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin and Ulrike Meinhof were dead. She became the girlfriend of fellow RAF member Wolfgang Grams and moved in with him. Arrest On 27 June 1993, Hogefeld and Grams arrived at a train station in Bad Kleinen where a group of GSG 9 officers were waiting to arrest them (the officers had received a tip-off from a fellow GSG 9 officer who had infiltrated the RAF). According to the GSG 9 men, Hogefeld and Grams started firing at them on sight; Grams fatally shot an officer named Michael Newrzella. According to the police Grams committed suicide and fell on the train tracks. However, it was suspected that Grams did not commit suicide but was shot by GSG 9 officers. The Staatsanwaltschaft Schwerin investigated these allegations and concluded in January 1994 that they were incorrect. Grams' parents challenged this conclusion in court, but it was upheld by five different courts, including the European Court of Human Rights in 1999. Interior Minister Rudolf Seiters took responsibility for the poor conducting and postprocessing of the operation and resigned in July of the year, as well as Chief Federal Prosecutor, Alexander von Stahl. Sentencing Several terrorist activities that Hogefeld was later found guilty of by a Higher Court in Germany were; *The murder of a young GI, Edward Pimental, in 1985 to obtain his I.D. to access the grounds of the U.S. Rhein-Main Air Base near Frankfurt.

The story, designs, and characters are based on Japanese mythology. Gameplay Like in most games of the genre, the player (who controls a kabuki) can use combos, flips and swings to fight against tough opponents, fighting them in groups from three to five. Surprinsingly, boss fights are often easier than regular enemies. There is also a time limit, usually about forty seconds, for the player to finish the stage. If the time reaches zero before the player passes the stage, the player will automatically lose the game as it will be declared a defeat. Similar to Golden Axe, the player can use a special magic power, but instead of bottles the player must manually pick up scrolls. The more scrolls the player has, the stronger the magic attack will be; if the player chooses to use this attack, all the scrolls will be consumed. There are also hidden bonus stages that can be accessed if the player approaches certain doors or rooms. These bonus stages contain magic scrolls, items to refill the character's health bar, or weapons. There are also traps and holes that both the player or the enemies can fall into. The traps and pits do not always hinder the player, and in fact can be beneficial if the player throws an enemy directly into the pit.

These proteins are secreted and play a role in left-right asymmetry determination of organ systems during development. Mutations of the genes encoding these proteins have been associated with left-right axis malformations, particularly in the heart and lungs. History Lefty, a divergent member of the transforming growth factor-Œ≤ (TGF beta) superfamily of proteins, was originally discovered in the Hamada lab at the Osaka University using deletion screening of cDNA libraries in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells to find clones that did not differentiate when induced to differentiate using retinoic acid. From these screens, researchers found one gene that was a tentative member of the TGF- beta superfamily that was predominantly expressed on the left side the embryo and aptly named it lefty. Like other members of the TGF-beta superfamily, lefty is synthesized as a preproprotein, meaning that the protein is proteolytically cleaved and excreted to produce the active form of the protein. However, lefty has only 20-25% sequence similarity with other members of the TGF-beta superfamily. Lefty is conserved in all vertebrates and many species have more than one homologue. Humans and mice, for instance have two homologues, Lefty 1 and Lefty 2, whose differential expression leads to distinct purposes while the mechanism of action is conserved.  Function  A simplified depiction of the gradients of nodal and lefty in the mouse embryo. Lefty proteins function as an antagonist of the Nodal Signaling pathway. Nodal is another signaling protein which is responsible for gastrulation, left-right patterning and induction of the primitive node. As NODAL protein diffuse through an embryo, it triggers Nodal Signaling within tissues with the required receptors and coreceptors. Activated nodal signaling leads to the transcription of the lefty gene. The protein is then expressed, proteolytically cleaved, and finally secreted. Secreted lefty binds to EGF-CFC proteins like one-eyed pinhead in zebrafish keeping the essential cofactor from associating with NODAL/ Activin-like receptor complex. This will effectually block Nodal Signaling. During induction of the primitive streak, lefty confines Nodal activity to the posterior end of the embryo, establishing a posterior signaling center and inducing the formation of the primitive streak and mesoderm.Carlson, Bruce M. \\"Formation of Germ Layers and Early Derivatives.\\" Human Embryology and Developmental Biology. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Mosby/Elsevier, 2009. 91-95. Print. (See Nodal Signaling or TGF beta signaling pathway for more information on the nodal signaling pathway.) There are many differences between the left and right sides, including heart and lung positioning. Mutations in these genes cause incorrect positioning of these organs (e.g., situs inversus), or in the case of constitutively inactive lefty, the embryo becomes entirely mesoderm and fails to pattern or develop. During vertebrate development, lefty proteins regulate left-right asymmetry by controlling the spatiotemporal influence of the NODAL protein. Lefty1 in the ventral midline prevents the Cerberus (paracrine factor or \\"Caronte\\") signal from passing to the right side of the embryo. This spatiotemporal control is achieved by using two sources of excreted lefty. While lefty is produced in response to activated nodal signaling, it is also produced and secreted in the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE). The balance of lefty from the AVE and from Nodal Signaling results in the patterning of the embryo and left-right asymmetry.  Clinical significance  Proper functioning of Lefty is crucial to the proper development of the heart, lungs, spleen, and liver. Mutations in Lefty, called Lefty-A, are associated with left-right patterning defects. This mutation may cause congenital heart defects due to malformation, interrupted inferior vena cava, and lack of lung asymmetry (left pulmonary isomerism). Lefty2 may play a role in endometrial bleeding.  References  * Carlson, Bruce M. \\"Formation of Germ Layers and Early Derivatives.\\" Human Embryology and Developmental Biology.

It lies south-east of Rome, and it borders the municipalities of Colonna, Gallicano nel Lazio, Monte Compatri, Palestrina, Rome, San Cesareo (former frazione of Zagarolo). Zagarolo's town center lies on a very narrow tuff hill, long and about wide, at an elevation of , surrounded by green valleys. The southern continuation of an important pilgrim route, the Via Francigena passes through the Zagarolo countryside. Zagarolo may have origins in Gabii, an ancient city founded in the 5th century, and sited a few kilometers from Zagarolo. Official site of the town of Zagarolo (in Italian) Zagarolo's town center is of medieval origin and its current urban plan was developed in the 16th century. The town is the birthplace of composer Goffredo Petrassi.Petrassi, Goffredo. (2008). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9059491 Main sights Most of the main attractions of Zagarolo are in the historical town center, concentrated around the narrow long main street (Via Antonio Fabrini and then Corso Vittorio Emanuele).  The Palace  The Palazzo Rospigliosi, in the city center, occupies the site of an ancient medieval castle, which is first referenced to when Pope Paschal II destroyed Zagarolo in the early 12th century after the rebellion of the Colonna family, of which the palace was one of the strongholds. For many centuries it remained under the Colonna influence, and was besieged and destroyed several times due to the rivalry between the papacy and the Colonna family. In the 16th century the Colonnas and the papacy started having peaceful relations, and Zagarolo became a duchy, hence the Palace became known as Palazzo Ducale. The palace came to be used as a residence and two additional major wings were built towards the piazza, frescoes were added and a hanging garden was built. It was in this Palace that in 1591 a commission of eight cardinals met to revise the Bible for a printed edition, among them cardinal Marcantonio Colonna and Saint Robert Bellarmine. The building is characterized by frescoes painted by mannerist artists of the 16th century, attributed to Dutch painters, to Antonio Tempesta, and to the Zuccaris (Taddeo Zuccari and Federico Zuccari). Here in 1606 Caravaggio created masterpieces for the Colonna family, in exchange for refuge on his journey to Naples, between Zagarolo and Paliano he executed the Supper at Emmaus, Mary Magdalen in Ecstasy and perhaps Saint Francis in Prayer. The Palace also saw the of Carlo Maratta and of Ludovico Gimignani, the latter dying there in 1697. In 1668, when the Rospigliosi acquired the duchy of Zagarolo, the Palace became their property, and was later in possession of the Pallavicini family, until it was sold to the comune in 1979. During World War II the palace was transformed in a German military hospital. Today the local library and Toy Museum are housed the Palace, and it is used for conventions, exhibitions and other cultural events.  Churches  The Church of St. Lawrence Martyr (1607) (Chiesa di San Lorenzo Martire), located in Piazza del Risorgimento, it is the church dedicated to the patron saint of Zagarolo St. Lawrence of Rome. The Convent and Church of St. Mary of the Graces (Santa Maria delle Grazie), located in Piazza Santa Maria The Church of St. Annunziata (1580‚Äì1582) (Chiesa di Santissima Annunziata), has a peculiar octagonal belltower, and dominates the skyline of Zagarolo. The Church of St. Peter (1717‚Äì1722) (Duomo di San Pietro Apostolo), a Baroque church built on the site of a more ancient church. It has an elliptical dome 46 meters high.  Other Features  The first gate to be encountered entering the city center from the southeast is Porta Rospigliosi, decorated with bas-reliefs in the 16th century and Roman busts and theatrical masques. The other gate, at the northwest entrance to the city is Porta San Martino, named in honour of Pope Martin V (Oddone Colonna). The Zagarolo Toy Museum is located in Rospigliosi Palace. The Museum offers a social reconstruction of toys and the act of playing in a series of sections that, through a historic excursus, crosses the fundamental periods of the 20th century. The communal council decided to create the museum in 1998. It was inaugurated in 2005 with a positive response from the critics and the public. It holds over 800 examples of Italian and European toys of the 20th century.Zagarolo Toy Museum website Outside the town center is the Tondo (as it is called by the local population), located at the hill called the Colle del Pero. It is a rare example of an ancient Roman Ludus dated to the 1st century AD, a sort of a little amphitheatre used as a gym or training ground for gladiators (see List of Roman amphitheatres). Geography The town center of Zagarolo lies on a very narrow tufaceous plateau (2 kilometers long and about 100 meters wide) at an elevation of 310 meters, surrounded by two green valleys, the \\"Valle del Formale\\" and the \\"Valle della Foresta\\". Most of Zagarolo's inhabitants live however in the rolling green hills around town. Climate Zagarolo has a Mediterranean climate with warm and dry summers and cool and wet winters.

A former stone and logging town, Freestone is the entryway to the Bohemian Highway. In 1974, Freestone became the first historic district named by Sonoma County. The downtown comprises a handful of historic buildings with a selection of local businesses, including a cheese shop, winery, bakery and a spa. Freestone has a population of 32. History Freestone is named after a sandstone quarry that was developed in the area around 1861. The area once consisted of three ranchos: Rancho Ca√±ada de Jonive, Rancho Estero Americano and Rancho Ca√±ada de Pogolimi. The area was split into three ranchos as the result of a dispute between three early settlers, James McIntosh, James Black and James Dawson. The three men were allowed to settle on the land by Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo in the 1830s, where they built a saw mill. Eventually the three men left the area. Jasper O'Farrell moved into the area in 1849, after exchanging Nicasio Rancho for Rancho Ca√±ada de Jonive. He eventually purchased Rancho Estero Americano. A land surveyor, O'Farrell surveyed the surrounding area, which he called Analy Township. O'Farrell found success in the area, acquiring a total of 560 acres of land. He was elected to the California State Senate in 1859. Within a year he had to sell his land and in 1870 he moved back to San Francisco. North Pacific Coast Railroad train in Freestone, 1893 Freestone had a saloon by 1849, followed by a general store the next year. Freestone became a stop on a new stagecoach line in 1853. That same year, an inn was built as well as two blacksmith shops. The inn burned down in 1861. A depot for the North Pacific Coast Railroad was built in Freestone, with the train starting to stop in the village in September 1876. A second inn, the Hinds Hotel was built by the depot in August, just prior to the train stop opening. The railroad transported lumber and produce to and from San Francisco. In 1930, the railroad stopped operating due to the growing popularity of cars and trucks. The first school was built in Freestone by the 1880s, which was used for schooling until 1958. In 1881, the first church was built in Freestone, a Methodist church. That church was eventually destroyed and a second church was built in 1907, only to be demolished in the 1960s. The town had a post office by the 1880s. The end of the railroad service to Freestone is considered the end of \\"the era of development and prosperity\\" historically. In 1974, Freestone was deemed a historic district by the County of Sonoma, making it the first historic landmark designated by the County. The district comprises 30 properties, consisting mainly of residential and commercial buildings in the Greek Revival, Italianate and Queen Anne architectural styles. The Hind's Hotel was designated Landmark #2 in the County that same year, followed by the now-demolished Morgan Williams Residence, and the remaining Freestone Schoolhouse and Freestone Country Store. Economy Historically, Freestone was first a lumber town, with a saw mill on the Salmon Creek. Eventually, a sandstone quarry was operated in the area. Railroad service eventually began, transporting lumber and produce to San Francisco. The railroad depot closed in 1930, halting economic growth in Freestone. Today, the economy is primarily hospitality based. Tourism Freestone comprises a handful of businesses, including a bakery, cheese store, general store, a gift shop and the Osmosis Day Spa Sanctuary.

Academic career An outstanding scholar from youth, Osuji attended Holy Ghost College, Owerri, Government College, Umuahia, the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and the University of Ibadan and performed his Post-Doctoral Research at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London. He was a Lecturer, Senior Lecturer and Associate Professor in the Department of Zoology, University of Ibadan (1973-1981), and became a member of the University's Senate. He also was a Visiting Scientific Fellow at the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Food and Agriculture Organization. He was Dean of the College of Science, Dean of the College of Postgraduate Studies, Deputy Vice- Chancellor and member of the Governing Council of Imo State University. He was also a Visiting Professor to several universities within and outside Nigeria. Prof Osuji actively participated in the Development of university education in Nigeria through policy making, research and publications. He has to his credit over 35 published papers and books. Osuji was later appointed Professor of Applied Biology, St. John's University, New York (CUNY) USA (1997-1999). Later career Prof. Osuji retired voluntarily from Imo State University in 1990 to pursue a career in politics. In 1991, he emerged as the Imo State Governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) with an unprecedented landslide victory. An enormously popular candidate, Osuji was heavily favored to win the governorship election ahead of the late Senator Evan Enwerem of the National Republican Convention. However, with a few days to the elections, the Federal Government of Nigeria, under General Ibrahim Babangida, inexplicably disqualified Osuji along with former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and other leading gubernatorial candidates in several states. Prof Osuji later served as Imo State Commissioner for Information and Social Development (1994-1996), and Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (2000-2003). Prof. Osuji was appointed Minister of Education in July 2003. His appointment was widely acknowledged as a round peg in a round hole. He was dismissed by President Olusegun Obasanjo in March 2005 following his indictment by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for allegedly offering N55 million ($400,000) in bribes to the National Assembly to pass an inflated budget. Obasanjo announced the dismissal in a national radio broadcast that implied his guilt. The case was handed to the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) for persecution. In April 2005, Osuji was questioned by the ICPC, as were former Senate leader Adolphus Wabara and Senators Abdulazeez Ibrahim, Emmanuel Okpede, Badamasi Maccido and Chris Adighije. In May 2005 Osuji appeared in the Abuja High Court along with Wabara and five lawmakers. After extended legal battles, on 1 June 2010, an Appeal Court sitting in Abuja declared that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against Osuji, describing the government's actions as \\"embarrassing, barbaric and uncivilized\\" and subsequently quashed all charges against Prof. Osuji. Prof. Osuji holds numerous traditional titles, most notably the Dike Eji-Eje Mba of Mbaise clan. He is married to Dr. (Mrs) Philomena Osuji and they are blessed with two daughters, three sons and six grandchildren.

The Amazon Stonehenge is located north of Cal√ßoene, from Macap√°, the capital of Amap√° state. Incorporates text from Agence France- Presse (AFP). The Parque Arqueol√≥gico do Solst√≠cio (Solstice Archaeological Park), referred to in academic sources as AP-CA-18, is an archaeological park located in Amap√° state, Brazil, near the city of Cal√ßoene. It contains a megalithic stone circle, colloquially known as the Amazon Stonehenge, consisting of 127 blocks of granite, each up to 4 meters tall, standing upright in a circle measuring over 30 meters in diameter at the bank of the Rego Grande river on a hilltop. Archaeologists believe that this site was built by indigenous peoples for astronomical, ceremonial, or burial purposes, and likely a combination. The function of this megalithic site is unknown, much like other sites such as Stonehenge, a much older site in Great Britain. Discovery The first reports of the Rego Grande site are from naturalist Emilio Goeldi in the late 19th century. Locals have called the site \\"Tropical Stonehenge\\" for some time. In 2005, archaeologists began excavation of the site after it was reported by a geologist during a socioeconomic study. Findings Though the stones have not been submitted to dating techniques, carbon-dating of pottery sherds has placed the site at 500 ‚Äì 2000 years old. The origin of these granite blocks has yet to be studied as well. In certain Megalithic sites, such as Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England, the blocks were moved to the site from some distance away. Archaeologists are not yet sure whether the Rego Grande site were also brought from elsewhere. On the winter solstice of December 21, the shortest day of the year in the northern hemisphere, the shadow of one of the blocks disappears when the sun is directly above it. The rock seems to be placed at angle so that the shadow is possibly small throughout the day. It is this block's alignment with the December solstice that leads archaeologists to believe the site was once a type of astronomical observatory. They believe the site was made by a sophisticated indigenous culture. One of the stones has a circular hole carved into it. During the winter solstice, the sun shines directly though this hole onto another rock for an extended amount of time, supporting the idea that Amazon Stonehenge was used as an astronomical site. Apart from the circular hole the granite stones that make up Amazon Stonehenge appear irregularly shaped. Whether this irregularity reflects primitive mining technology or holds clues regarding potential uses of the site has not yet been determined.https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/world/americas/brazil-amazon- megaliths-stonehenge.html?_r=0 During the excavations two large pits have been found, both approximately 1.5 ‚Äì 2 meters deep and covered by large stone slabs. During excavation, shards of pottery, red clay, and ash from human remains were found. Three intact urns were found in a triangular formation at the bottom of one pit and more intact urns, as well as a few lids were found in the second. Remnants of cremated human remains have been found with these shards and in the urns, suggesting that these pits were either burial sites or that select human remains were buried here because they were significant. Shards of bowls and other pieces of pottery have been found in smaller pits near by. These bowls, lids, and urns have been found created in the shapes of animals and human-like figurines. Significance  Evidence has been found near the Rego Grande site and all over the Amazon to suggest that the indigenous people of the region lived in a complex societies that involved both agriculture and a close relationship with the natural environment around them. There are also several other megalithic sites in Brazil that follow the curves of the Rego Grande river. The fact that these Megalithic sites seem to follow such a pattern suggests that Amazon Stonehenge may have been used as either a ceremonial site and that its structure and cultural significance were shared amount different indigenous communities in pre-Columbian Brazil. Despite not knowing the exact use of the Rego Grande site, most scientist agree that it alludes to a pre-Columbian society that was much more complex than previously thought.

Situated at a distance of from Mumbai, Murud is a tourist destination. The Palace of Nawab is located in Murud. The palace was built in 1885 for administration purposes. The palace is still owned by the descendants of the Nawab and is a private property. About Murud is known for a notable beach, and for its proximity to Janjira off the coast of Rajapuri, a sea fort. Murud-Janjira is the local name for a fort situated at the coastal City of Murud, in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India. It is notable for being the only fort along India's western coast that remained undefeated despite Dutch and English East India Company attacks. History Main Land to Murud Janjira.At the time they seized the fort, the Siddis were employed by the Bahamani Sultan of Ahmednagar and a Habshi, Malik Ambar (1550‚Äì1626), held a prominent position in that government. Before the rise of the Maratha sardars, the courts of the Bahamani sultanates were rent by rivalry between the Indian Muslims and the foreign Muslims, as a result of which, the Sultans began to patronize the Marathas as a third force, leading to the rise of Shivaji and the Maratha Empire. Malik Amber initially rose to great prominence as the Prime Minister of Ahmednagar. He is credited with having carried out a systematic revenue settlement of major portions of the Deccan, which formed the basis for many subsequent settlements. When the Ahmadnagar kingdom was conquered by Bijapur and the Mughals in alliance, the Siddis switched their allegiance to the Sultanate of Bijapur; when the Bijapur kingdom was conquered by the Mughal Empire, the Habshis switched their allegiance to the Mughal Empire. As clients of these Muslim states, the Siddis were nominally part of their navies, and fulfilled the role of defending Muslim interests in the sea, and particularly, access by sea for the Hajj and Umrah, for which reason, the interior Muslim states felt compelled to aid and rescue the Siddis from their enemies. Despite being feudatories, first of Bijapur and then of the Mughals, the Siddis acted as if they were independent, and lived mainly by piracy on coastal shipping. The piracy of the Siddis provoked the various local powers to attempt to suppress them, but despite efforts by the Portuguese, Dutch, English and the Marathas, the fort was never conquered. The fort thus earned a reputation for being impregnable. The reputation may be false. Mass mobilizations by the English and Marathas were always forced off before they could complete the task by the intervention of another power, such as the Mughals, creating a diversion in order to prevent the fall of Murud-Janjira. The same happened with Goa, with the Mughals invading Maratha lands in order to divert Maratha attempts to conquer Goa. As the Muslim powers of the interior waned in the face of rising English power, the Siddi state submitted to England under the system of Subsidiary Alliance, becoming a dependency under paramountcy of the Kings of England. HH Nawab Sidi Muhammed Khan II Sidi Ahmad Khan was the last Ruler of Murud-Janjira. A patron of arts and culture, he supported such musicians as Beenkar Abid Hussain Khan. The state continued in this condition until late 1947, when the last prince acceded his state to the Indian Union, and his state was merged into the Bombay Presidency which was later transformed into the State of Bombay and the State of Maharashtra.

The head has two crests; the hind crest, which extends down the occiput, is erected when alarmed and during intentional behaviors including pair bonding and courtship displays. The male has a broad and greatly elongated tail of twelve feathers. The tail covert (or \\"train\\") of the male is the longest of any bird and is believed to contain the longest (and widest) feathers to occur in a wild bird; the Reeves's pheasant has tail feathers of similar length but which are considerably narrower. The tail coverts measure up to in length, giving the bird a total length of . Although traditionally treated as a single species with two subspecies, it has long been suspected that a species pair is involved and recent evidence, albeit using the controversial Tobias criteria, also supports treating each subspecies as a separate species. The split results in two monotypic species: Malaysian crested argus Rheinardia nigrescens of the central Malaysian Isthmus, and Vietnamese crested argus Rheinardia ocellata, of the Annamite mountain range. The two forms differ significantly in plumage, display and vocalisations and both are threatened by human activity. Description The female is similar in size, with a prominent marbled barring and more colourful dorsal plumage than the male. Her conspicuous white facial plumage is like the male, marked with disruptive patterning. The female's crest is different morphologically, with more rigid plumes that take up more surface area along the occiput and upper hind neck. The female's tail is elongated and laterally compressed as is that of the male but of considerably shorter length. The average length of the female is . Despite being sexually dimorphic galliform by length, the male only weighs about 20% more than the female. The average weight is around .Biddle, Tami Davis, Pheasants, Partridges, and Grouse : A Guide to the Pheasants, Partridges, Quails, Grouse, Guineafowl, Buttonquails, and Sandgrouse of the World (Princeton Field Guides). Princeton University Press (2002), The wings of the crested argus are of unusual size and length for its weight. They are wide and square like those of Argusianus versus rounded and abbreviated like those of 'true' pheasants. Additionally, there is no discernible trailing edge secondary wing notch amongst the flight feathers, indicating a capacity of sustained flight in species of this genus. Their wings are morphologically similar to the wings of certain semi-arboreal Craciformes, particularly guans of the genus Pipile. The feet and legs of crested argus are also notable in the presence of curiously developed leg scales in males which are widened in such a matter that they give each limb the appearance of the foreleg of a Varanid lizard. The toes are long and gracile and like other peafowls, the hind toe is less recumbent than those of more strictly terrestrial Galliformes. Behaviour and ecology Female Vietnamese crested argus at Ho Chi Minh City Zoo. Little is known about them in the wild. Shy and elusive, the crested argus is found in submontane primary forests of Vietnam, Laos and Malaysia in Southeast Asia. The diet consists mainly of invertebrates, mollusks, amphibians, small reptiles, bamboo shoots, leaves, fruits and fungi. Little is known about its reproductive strategy. While it is believed by some authorities to be polygamous, there is no direct evidence to substantiate this theory. Naturalist William Beebe documented pairs of crested argus flying to and from the overstory. This suggests that there may be indefinite pair bonds. There is marked delayed maturity in both species. They appear to be fully adult only in their fifth or sixth year. The male performs various displays that include serpentine erratic deportment behaviors which include perceptible quill vibration. The lower extremities of the male's wings and tail are pushed vertically into the ground leaving trails in sand and leaf litter. These performances may culminate in the lateral compression of the body and plumage and spreading of his train. The head is held parallel to the ground throughout these display behaviors exhibiting upper throat bristles in one species and downy plumuelles in the second, which together with the forward positioning of the crests, obscure the shape of the head. The male also erects a nuchal hood and hisses audibly while stomping his feet. Like other peafowls, the crested argus employs these and more complex display behaviors in anti-predatory encounters, especially with reptiles. Habitat and distribution From limited anecdotal observations of local indigenous peoples, both species select nest sites in elevated reaches, often amongst escarpments on steep slopes amongst leaf litter. They produce very small clutches of from one-two large eggs which are incubated for 25 days. Like other peafowls, crested argus chicks hatch with developed wing feathers. They are bill fed for the first few weeks. In captivity, males also invest in chick rearing, both bill feeding and brooding the chicks both on and off the ground. Like other peafowl, crested argus retire on emergent trees above the forest canopy for many hours a day. They will remain on these trees for days at a time during the wet season. Crested argus are strong fliers and pairs have been reported flying together.

Biography  Koizumi was born in Riverdale, Bronx, a neighborhood in New York City. Her mother was a Dutch nurse and her father was a Japanese graphic artist. She started modeling at the age of fifteen, and in 1983 she dropped out of Parsons School of Design to pursue modeling full-time. By 1984 The New York Times, covering the Milan fashion shows, called Koizumi the \\"one model that none can keep their eyes off\\". The next year she appeared in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and Self, and the Sun-Sentinel noted that she had become \\"Giorgio Armani's favorite model\\". Koizumi made her acting debut in the 1985 Michael Cimino film Year of the Dragon as Tracy Tzu, a Chinese American television reporter who falls in love with the fanatical cop Stanley White, played by Mickey Rourke. The Los Angeles Times summarized the character as \\"there to fulfill all Oriental-woman fantasies\\", and The New York Times called Koizumi \\"so ineffectual a part of the film's framework that she is even upstaged, in a nude scene, by a glimpse of the Brooklyn Bridge\\". Her performance in the film was so widely panned that it \\"nipped her budding film career\\", but she subsequently had a cameo in Abel Ferrara's King of New York and continued her modeling career with print work in Self, French Vogue, and the September 1989 cover of Mirabella, along with television commercials for Michelob, L'Eggs, and Levi's, and runway modeling for Karl Lagerfeld and Donna Karan. Koizumi left modeling in 1989 to work as an intern for a record label, with the goal of pursuing a career in music. She later worked for the New York Prada store, and raised three children.

The group's mandate is \\"Dedicated to achieving recognition and equality for same sex relationships and associated family rights through education and legal action\\". Meeting this mandate was accomplished by intervening in various precedent-setting legal cases, through representation at various pride parades and most notably in suing the Canadian federal government over failure to amend 58 pieces of federal legislation that were charter-infringing due to the definition of spouse. Creation The Foundation is made up of community activists and lawyers. On May 17, 1994, the Ontario Attorney General introduced the bill to provide same-sex couples with rights and obligations equal to opposite-sex common law couples. The legislation would have amended the definition of \\"spouse\\" in 79 provincial statutes. The Bill was defeated by a vote of 68 to 59 on second reading on June 9, 1994.Debate and vote at second reading. Intervener On multiple occasions, the Foundation sought and was granted intervener status in various court cases. An intervener is a party that has an interest in the case, but is not either the appellant or respondent. M. v. H. * A lesbian couple had been in a long-term relationship. When the relationship ended, one of the women, M, made a claim for support from her former partner under the Ontario Family Law Act. The definition of spouse in the Act that applied to support orders did not include same-sex couples. M brought a Charter challenge to this definition. She won at the lower court level and the appeals level; the provincial government appealed each time, rather than the respondent H. In reaction to the success of the case at the Supreme Court of Canada, the Ontario government introduced and passed an Act, Bill 5, Amendments Because of the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in M. v. H. Act, 1999. :M. v. H. - Court of Appeal for Ontario :M. v. H. - Court of Appeal for Ontario - motion requesting intervener status :M. v. H. - Supreme Court of Canada Vriend * Delwyn Vriend was fired from his job at a church run college because he was gay. When he sought to bring a human rights complaint against his former employer, he was told that he could not do so because the Individual Rights Protection Act of Alberta did not protect people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Vriend and three lesbian and gay groups then brought a Charter challenge. They claimed that the government and Legislature of Alberta were discriminating by their refusal to add protection on the basis of sexual orientation to Alberta's human rights act despite repeated calls to do so. The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously held that the Alberta Individual Rights Protection Act treated lesbians and gay men in a discriminatory fashion and denied them equal protection and equal benefit of the law. This discrimination could not be reasonable justified in a free and democratic society. :Vriend v. Alberta - Supreme Court of Canada Rosenberg * Two women, Nancy Rosenberg and Margaret Evans, had both received the employee benefits offered by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) for their lesbian partners. When CUPE was unable to register its plan to include same- sex survivor benefits, the two woman challenged the Income Tax Act's definition of \\"spouse\\". They said that they were being discriminated against under s. 15(1) of the Charter of Rights & Freedoms, which guarantees that every individual has the right to equal benefit of the law without discrimination. The Ontario Court of Appeal, in a unanimous decision, overturned the lower court's decision and found that the restrictive definition of \\"spouse\\" in the Income Tax Act violated the Charter. The Court determined that the appropriate remedy was the immediate reading in of same- sex partners into the definition of \\"spouse\\" as it relates to private pension plans. The federal government decided not to appeal this decision. This case led to amendments to the Income Tax Act recognising same-sex common-law spouses. :Rosenberg v.

It lends its name to the surrounding residential community, which is predominantly Protestant working-class. The Sandy Row area had a population of 2,153 in 2001; in 2018, the population was estimated to be around 4,000. It is a staunchly loyalist area of Belfast, being a traditional heartland for affiliation with the paramilitary Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and the Orange Order. Location Sandy Row is in south Belfast, beginning at the edge of the city centre, close to the Europa Hotel. The road runs south from the Boyne Bridge over the old Dublin railway line beside Great Victoria Street station, then crosses Donegall Road and ends at the bottom of Lisburn Road. At the north end of the road was Murray's tobacco factory, opened in 1810, while at the other is a large Orange hall. History Orange Arch erected in Sandy Row, c. 1921. Its builder, Frank Reynolds is seen standing in the photograph, fifth from the left Formerly known as Carr's Row, Sandy Row is one of the oldest residential areas of Belfast.Sandy Row: a little part of Belfast Its growth in population was in large part due to the expansion of the linen industry in Rowland Street.Sandy Row History Part 1 The name Sandy Row derived from the sandbank which abutted the road that followed the high-water mark resulting from the flow off the tidal waters of the Lagan River estuary. For over two thousand years, the road along the sandbank was the principal thoroughfare leading south from Carrickfergus. In the 19th century Sandy Row became a bustling shopping district, and by the turn of the 20th-century, there were a total of 127 shops and merchants based in the road. It continued to draw shoppers from all over Belfast until the outbreak of the Troubles in the late 1960s. The rows of 19th-century terraced houses in the streets and backstreets branching off Sandy Row have been demolished and replaced with modern housing. Six of the houses which formerly lined Rowland Street have been rebuilt in the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum. It is a traditionally Protestant, close-knit loyalist community, noted for its elaborate Orange Order parades on the Twelfth, with over 40 Arches erected in its streets and a marching band of teenaged girls known as the \\"Sandy Row Girl's Band\\".Murphy, p.288 In addition to the arches spanning the road, buildings and homes are decorated with flags, bunting and banners. The first Orange Arch was erected by Frank Reynolds in about 1921.Sandy Row History, part 2 In 1690, on his way south to fight at the Battle of the Boyne, King William III of England and his troops travelled along Sandy Row. Tradition holds that part of his army camped on the ground where the Orange Hall now stands. The Hall was opened in June 1910 by Lady Henderson, wife of former Lord Mayor of Belfast, James Henderson. By 1908, there were 34 Orange Lodges in the district. In the 19th and 20th-centuries, there was much sectarian fighting and rioting between Sandy Row Protestants and Catholics from Pound Loney, in the Lower Falls Road. In the spring 1941 Belfast Blitz during the calamitous 15/16 April raid, the Luftwaffe dropped a parachute landmine at the top of Blythe Street, killing and fatally injuring over ten people including children. Terraced houses on both sides of the street were badly damaged, many with their facades blasted off. The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester paid a visit to the devastated street. The Sandy Row redevelopment association which was founded in 1970, was one of the first loyalist community groups to open an advice centre.Nelson, Sarah (1984). Ulster's Uncertain Defenders: Protestant political, paramilitary and community groups and the Northern Ireland conflict. Belfast: Appletree Press. p.141 In 1996, the Sandy Row Community Forum was established. It acts as an umbrella organisation for all the community groups in the area. The Troubles Paramilitary mural formerly displayed at the entrance to Sandy Row (removed 2012) During The Troubles, the area had a strong Ulster Defence Association (UDA) presence. Sandy Row is part of the UDA South Belfast Brigade, commanded for many years by the late John McMichael and currently by Jackie McDonald. Its first known commander was Sammy Murphy who also led the Sandy Row UDA. He engaged in talks with the British Army during the Ulster Workers Council Strike in May 1974 to defuse a potentially violent confrontation between the Army and UDA over street barricades that had been erected in Sandy Row.Fisk, Robert (1975). The Point of No Return: the strike which broke the British in Ulster. London: Times Books. pp.145-148 In December 1972, senior UDA member Ernie Elliott was shot dead outside a Sandy Row club by a fellow UDA man after a drunken brawl.McDonald, Henry & Cusack, Jim (2004). UDA: Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror. Penguin Ireland. pp. 34-35 On 7 February 1973, Brian Douglas, a Protestant fireman from Sailortown was shot to death by the UDA whilst fighting a fire caused by street disturbances in Bradbury Place.CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths - 1973 Sandy Row UDA members also launched a series of attacks on nearby Durham Street, a mainly Catholic area between Sandy Row and Falls Road, in the early 1970s with four Catholics killed in the area, including 16-year-old Bernard McErlain, in late March‚ÄìApril 1973.McDonald & Cusack, p. 54 Two Protestant civilian men were killed on 30 March 1974 in a no-warning bomb attack carried out by an unknown republican paramilitary group against the Crescent Bar. On 24 July 1974, Ann Ogilby, a 32-year-old Protestant single mother of four, was savagely beaten to death with bricks and sticks inside the disused Warwick's bakery in Hunter Street by two teenagers from the Sandy Row women's UDA unit, commanded by Elizabeth \\"Lily\\" Douglas. The bakery had been converted to a UDA club.Simpson, Alan (1999). Murder Madness: True Crimes of The Troubles. Dublin: Gill & McMillan. pp.38-39 Ogilby's six-year-old daughter was outside the door and overheard her mother's screams inside whilst loud disco music played. Ogilby had been \\"sentenced to death\\" at a kangaroo court presided over by eight UDA women after it was discovered she was having an affair with a senior UDA man, who was married to one of the unit's members. She had also made defamatory remarks about her lover's wife. On 30 January 1976, the Provisional IRA exploded a car bomb outside the Klondyke Bar on the corner of McAdam Street. John Smiley, a middle-aged Protestant civilian was killed outright in the blast. Many people inside the pub suffered serious injuries including a barmaid who lost an eye, Vina Galaway.CAIN web service: Sutton Index of Deaths - 1976 Less than two years before the attack, the Klondyke Bar was the subject of a photographic essay by Bill Kirk in a series of photographs taken in Sandy Row. The Klondyke had been built in 1872. In the same year of the Klondyke bombing, an 18-year-old Catholic girl had her throat slit behind a Sandy Row pub by loyalist paramilitaries after she had been discovered drinking inside with Protestant friends.Murphy, Dervla (1979). A Place Apart. Harmondsworth: Penguin ; p. 144 City Hospital tower and chimney in the background, are now demolished. Thomas Vance, one of the 18 British soldiers killed in the Warrenpoint ambush, was a native of Sandy Row. In October 2011, a bomb was discovered on a patch of ground at Bradbury Place, which caused a security alert resulting in the evacuation of homes, bars, and businesses in the area. Army bomb disposal experts carried out a controlled explosion on the device. The large UDA/Ulster Freedom Fighters mural was one of many loyalist murals found in Sandy Row; it could be seen from the northern end of the street. The mural was supposed to mirror the Free Derry Corner republican mural. It was announced in June 2012 that the mural would be painted over with another showing William of Orange. The announcement was made by Jackie McDonald following a year of talks with residents and business leaders, some of whom claimed that the presence of the mural was dissuading other businesses from settling in office blocks nearby. It was removed on 25 June and replaced with the mural depicting William of Orange. Sandy Row contains a loyalist souvenir shop, the \\"One Stop Ulster Shop\\", which sells UDA and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) paraphernalia.Image of the shop The John McMichael Centre (named after the former South Belfast UDA leader) which helps former loyalist prisoners, is also located on Sandy Row. Demographics The Sandy Row Neighbourhood Renewal Area (NRA) was designated by the Department for Social Development in 2004, with boundaries extending along the Westlink, Donegall Road and Great Victoria Street. On Census day (29 April 2001) there were a total of 2,153 people living in the Sandy Row NRA. Of these: *20% were aged under 16 years and 21% were aged 60 and over; *44% of the population were male and 56% were female; *10% were from a Catholic community background; *86% were from a 'Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related)' community background; *14% of people aged 16‚Äì74 were unemployed.

Ipswich, MA: Salem Press, pp. 1000-1002. It is also sometimes known as the Socotran cormorant or, more rarely, as the Socotra shag. Individuals occasionally migrate as far west as the Red Sea coast. Despite its name, it was only confirmed in 2005 that it breeds on the Socotra islands in the Indian Ocean.BirdLife International (2011). Species Factsheet: Phalacrocorax nigrogularis. Retrieved 5 October 2011. The Socotra cormorant is an almost entirely blackish bird with a total length of about . In breeding condition, its forecrown has a purplish gloss and its upperparts have a slaty-green tinge, there are a few white plumes around the eye and neck and a few white streaks at the rump. Its legs and feet are black and its gular skin blackish. All these deviations from pure black are less marked outside the breeding season. There is little information on this species' foraging or diet. Like all cormorants its dives for its food. Older reports suggest that it can stay submerged for up to 3 minutes, which is high for a cormorant and suggests that it would be capable of deep diving. However, there are also reports of foraging in flocks, and this is more usually seen in cormorants that feed in mid-water. The birds are highly gregarious, with roosting flocks of 250,000 having been reported, and flocks of up to 25,000 at sea. Some authors, such as Paul Johnsgard, place this species, along with a number of other related cormorants, in a genus Leucocarbo. Since 2000, this species has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, on the grounds of its small number of breeding localities and ongoing rapid decline. The decline is caused by coastal development, disturbance and marine pollution near its nesting colonies; in 2000 it was estimated that the world population was about 110,000 breeding pairs or 330,000‚Äì500,000 individual birds. The only protected nesting colony in the Persian Gulf is one of about 30,000 pairs on the Bahraini Hawar Islands off the coast of Qatar, and this is a Ramsar Convention listed site.Bahrain Bird Report. Socotra Cormorant. Retrieved 5 October 2011. Of the remaining 13 colonies (9 different locations), the Hawar colony is the largest. In the northern part of its range alone, about 12 colonies are known to have disappeared since the 1960s. The birds may also be affected by oil pollution at sea. During the First Gulf War, images of badly oiled cormorants from the Gulf were regularly shown in the western media, and although the great cormorant is also found in the Persian Gulf, it is likely that many of these were Socotra cormorants. In 2012, the Environment Agency ‚Äì Abu Dhabi (EAD) monitored wild birds throughout Abu Dhabi at nearly 60 sites and recorded 420 species from 60 families. Nearly 12,000 breeding pairs of the globally threatened Socotra Cormorant were recorded at five to six small islands in the Emirate. The Socotra cormorant is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. References *Johnsgard, P. A. (1993).

History The name originates from its role as vacation resort for the ancient Roman gens Genucia. In the fifth century, during the reign of Pope Sixtus III, the town of Genazzano contributed a large portion of its revenue for the Roman basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. In the 11th century AD it was a fief of the Colonna family who, from their baronial Palace (castle), controlled the road from Naples to Rome. In the late fifteenth century, it became fief of the Borgia Family. Landmarks The Our Lady of Good Counsel original fresco from Genazzano. The church of the Madonna del buon consiglio, built in appreciation for the town's contribution to Santa Maria Maggiore, and entrusted in 1356 to the Augustinian Order, holds the original fresco of Our Lady of Good Counsel () a title given to the Blessed Virgin Mary, after the allegedly miraculous fresco. Measuring , the image is executed on a thin layer of porcelain no thicker than an egg shell.Joan Carroll Cruz, 1984 Relics, Huntington: Our Sunday Visitor, page 74 Over the centuries, devotions to Our Lady of the Good Counsel grew among saints and Popes. More than any other pope, Leo XIII was deeply attached to this devotion.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices page 515 The small Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel (the White Scapular) was presented by the Hermits of St. Augustine to Pope Leo XIII, who, in December 1893, approved it and endowed it with indulgences. On 22 April 1903, that same Pope included the invocation \\"Mater boni consilii\\" in the Litany of Loreto. At the southern end of the village, there is a Nymphaeum built at the dawn of the 16th century and attributed to Donato Bramante. Genazzano DOC On the southern slopes of Monti Prenestini overlooking the Valle del Sacco is the Genazzano Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) region that produces both red and white wines. The DOC red blend is composed of 70‚Äì90% Sangiovese, 10‚Äì30% Cesanese Comune and up to 20% of other local red grape varieties like Abbuoto.

It is a holy place where Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was born. Located on the western bank of the Hooghly River, it is considered to have been founded in 1063 CE, and served as the old capital of the Sena dynasty. A center of learning and philosophy in medieval India, the city is still noted for its traditional Sanskrit schools. The Navya Nyaya school of logic reached its peak with the efforts of some well known contemporary philosophers of Nabadwip. The great Vaishnava saint, social reformer and an important figure of the Bhakti movement, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486‚Äì1533) was born here. It was after Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's birth that Nabadwip became an important center of pilgrimage for the Vaishnavas worldwide as well as for Hindus in general. Many who follow Gaudiya Vaishnavism visit Nabadwip to celebrate the auspicious birthday day of Shri Mahaprabhu, which, as per lunal calculations, occurs on Phalguni Purnima (i.e. on the Full moon day of February‚ÄìMarch). This day is commonly known as Gaura-purnima. Aside from this, Nabadwip is visited for various other festivals like Dol yatra,and Rasa purnima. The Bhagirathi river originally flowed down the west of Nabadwip in the past, forming a natural boundary between the districts of Purba Bardhaman and Nadia. With time it has shifted its course to where it is at present, cutting the city off from the rest of the Nadia district. Etymology The name of the city is derived from the conjugation of the Bengali words /naba/ (new) and /dwipa/ (island) meaning New-island. In the down stream of the river Ganges, the alluvial deposits carried over during its course that starts at the Himalayas, were gradually deposited, forming a new island which is present day's Nabadwip. The name Nabadwip and Nadia has the same connotation of the same geographical location flanked at west and north by the Ganges at earlier times. Kabi Karnapur used Nabadwip as Nabƒ´na dbƒ´pa·πÅ (Bengali: ‡¶®‡¶¨‡ßÄ‡¶® ‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶¨‡ßÄ‡¶™‡¶Ç), mean New Island in his book Chaitanya CharitamritamKabi Karnapur, Sri Chaitanya Charitam, 623 The claim that the name Nabadwip refers to an area comprising nine islets has no ground. There are many historical references in this respect. Actually the misconception around the nomenclature of the name \\"Nabadwip\\" arose since the publication of the book \\"Bhakti Ratnakar\\" of Narahari Chakraborty. Narahari Chakraborty's claim, however, is not supportable from the perspective of geographical definition of the term Island. He might have made-up the idea of \\"nine islands\\" since \\"naba\\" in Bengali also means 'nine'. Hence \\"Nabadwip\\" i.e. nine islands, namely Antardwip, Simantadwip, Rudradwip, Madhyadwip, Godrumdwip, Ritudwip, Jahnudwip, Modadrumdwip, and Koladwip. However again, it is to mention that all these islands are loosely scattered over a vast geographical area that the Historians do not approve of the idea as being \\"Nabadwip\\". History Although significant examples of the history of Nabadwip have been found since the Sen dynasty, various historians have been referring to Nabadwip in the Pala period and the Shura dynasty. The English historian mentions Nabadwip as the capital of Adishur. Sen era It is known from the Deopara stone slab of Rajshahi district that Raja Samanta Sen, a resident of Karnataka, lived in the Ganges-Pulin in his last years when he was defeated by his tenants and zamindars. According to the eminent historian Harprasad Shastri, Samanta Sen lived on the shores of Bhagirathi, probably in Nabadwip in his last years. Prior to Gour, Nabadwip was the capital of Sena dynasty during the reigns of Ballal Sen and Lakshman Sen. They ruled Bengal from here in the period from 1159 to 1206. The Ballal Dhipi in the Bamanpukur area adjacent to Nabadwip, which is associated with the history of Sen dynasty, has been protected by the Archaeological Survey of India. During the reign of Lakshman Sen, in 1202 AD, Bakhtiyar Khalji invaded and plundered Nabadwip and defeated Lakshman Sen. This victory paved the way for Muslim rule in Bengal. At that time the prosperity of Nabadwip was particularly damaged. During the Muslim rule, various temples, golden monasteries and idols of Bengal and Nabadwip were destroyed. Chaitanya era The birth of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is an important chapter of the fifteenth century. With the advent of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vaishnava culture was well established in Nabadwip. However, even before the birth of Mahaprabhu, during the reign of Jalaluddin Fateh Shah (1481‚Äì87), royal fear appeared in Nabadwip. The ruling society and the Brahmin society obstructed the spread of Vaishnava culture in Nabadwip at that time. Many Brahmin scholars and common people had to leave Nabadwip at that time due to the oppression of the king. However, when Chand Kazi, the then ruler of Nabadwip, issued an order to the Vaishnava community to stop chanting, Mahaprabhu went to Kazi's house with his companion and rescued Kazi, which is the first instance of lawlessness movement in the history of India. During Chaitanya and later, various Pandits-Sadhaks-Vidyalankars and Sanskrit Pandits were born in Nabadwip. During the period of Chaitanya, Basudev Sarvabhauma, Raghunath Shiromani, Raghunandan etc. and later Krishnananda Agamavagisha, Buno Ramnath etc., Nabadwip became the main center of Sanskrit practice and learning. At the time of Raja Rudra Roy, there were four thousand students and six hundred professors teaching in Nabadwip. For five centuries, it was referred to as \\"Oxford of East\\". Next centuries Buno Ramnath, Shankara Tarkabagish and other scholars and logicians made the name of Nabadwip famous in the eighteenth century. Shakti worship spread in Nabadwip during the time of Raja Krishnachandra of Nadia royal family. During the reign of Raja Krishnachandra Roy and later Raja Girish Chandra, the popularity, glory and pomp of Shakta Rash increased. Various temples and idols were established in that time.

Originally referred to as the BK 117 C2, the EC145 is based upon the MBB/Kawasaki BK 117 C1, which became a part of the combined Eurocopter line-up in 1992 with the merger of Messerschmitt- B√∂lkow-Blohm's helicopter division of Daimler-Benz and the helicopter division of A√©rospatiale-Matra to form Eurocopter. The EC145 is a twin-engine aircraft and can carry up to nine passengers along with two crew, depending on customer configuration. The helicopter is marketed for passenger transport, corporate transport, emergency medical services (EMS), search and rescue, parapublic and utility roles. In 2015, the EC145 was rebranded as the H145 by Airbus Helicopters. Military variants of the helicopter have also been produced under various designations, such as H145M or UH-72, and have been used for training, logistics, medical evacuation, reconnaissance, light attack, and troop- transport operations. Development Origins French Gendarmerie EC145, 2009 The EC145 was a joint development between Eurocopter and Kawasaki Heavy Industries on the basis of their successful prior jointly produced BK 117 C1. Rather than pursuing an entirely clean sheet design, the forward cockpit and modern avionics of Eurocopter's EC 135 were adopted in combination with the proven BK 117's rear section; Flight International described the new helicopter, originally designed as BK 117 C2, as being \\"90% a combination of these two aircraft [The EC135 and BK 117 C1]\\".Gray 2002, p. 30 However, there were significant areas of redesign, advantages held by the EC145 over its predecessor include possessing a greater range and payload capacity, a considerably increased and uninterrupted cabin area, reduced vibration and noise emissions, and measures to simplify maintenance and minimise operational costs.Gray 2002, p. 30-31. The noise signature of the EC145 is reportedly 60% lower than that of the BK 117 C1.Wagstaff, Bill. \\"EC 145 bows in quietly.\\" AIN Online, 21 May 2008.

Safety certification of the EC145 was awarded by the German Luftfahrt- Bundesamt and Japanese Civil Aviation Bureau in December 2000; and by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in early 2002. Eurocopter and Kawasaki have an agreement under which both firms independently manufacture and market the rotorcraft, while working collaboratively on development and upgrades.

As a result, Aurangazeb issued orders to recover annual tributes from the rulers of Shivalik hills, who had been defaulting on the payment. Alif Khan was given the responsibility of recovering dues from Kangra and adjoining principalities. The Raja of Kangra and another chieftain called Raja Dayal yielded to the demands of Alif Khan. However, Raja Bhim Chand of Kahlur (Bilaspur) refused to oblige and formed an alliance with other chieftains opposed to the Mughals. Guru Gobind Singh also decided to support Raja Bhim Chand. Alif Khan's Mughal army and his aides were defeated at a battle in Nadaun. The date of the battle is given differently by different authors, as 1687, 1689, 1690, 20 March 1691, and 4 April 1691. After the battle ended, Guru Gobind Singh stayed in Nadaun for eight days, before returning to Anandpur. Later, Maharaja Ranjit Singh built a gurdwara on the spot where the Guru had pitched his tent. The Gurdwara was affiliated to Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee in 1935. Economy The economy of Nadaun is primarily based on 3 sources namely Agriculture, Business, Government Employment (mainly in Education). The villages in Nadaun sub- division depend primarily on Agriculture for their income. In addition there is a Silk farm in Nadaun. Some people earn their livelihood also by fishing from Beas River. Nadaun fish and its preparation is very famous in the region. Nadaun town has got a big business community mostly involved in small to medium size businesses. These businesses take care of day-to-day needs of not only the Nadaun town but also of many villages around Nadaun like Bela,Bharoli,Bharmoti, Chaukathi, Bhumpal, Bhatta, Gagaal, jalari Bhloon, Sera etc. Because of this reason Nadaun town is sometimes called \\"Bazaar\\" by local people. The main businesses in Nadaun are Grossary Stores (both retail and whole-sale), furniture, goldsmith, clothing, construction materials. Some small scale industries exist in Nadaun which produce the finished products in some of these areas.  Transportation  There is no railway line connecting this town to rest of the country. The nearest railway station (Jwalamukhi Road) is around 25 km from Nadaun. However Nadaun is well connected with road network. It has got a central position in terms of road connectivity. Two main roads diverge from Nadaun : One in the direction of state capital Shimla (National Highway NH88) and other in the direction of the major nearby cities of Chandigarh and Hoshiarpur (National Highway 70). The transportation within Nadaun and surrounding areas is done mostly with the help of privately and government operated buses. Nadaun has a large bus station (at least bigger compared to towns of similar size in this area). Adjacent to it is a taxi stand where one can easily rent a taxi for short or long distance. For transportation of goods within the Nadaun town one can take help from a Coolie. Occasionally people use boat to cross Beas River. Living in Nadaun Nadaun town is divided into following areas : New Bus-stand area, Old Bus- stand area (also called Jesri), the main-market area, the old-market area (also called Pattan). The old-market area used to be main center of shopping when the Nadaun Bridge was not present. After the construction of bridge the market shifted to what is currently main-market area. The main-market area is further divided into 2 parts : the upper bazaar which is close to the Bus- Station and the main-bazaar. Main-Bazaar is in the heart of Nadaun town which is the center of business in Nadaun. Pattan area has got a big play-ground which hosts various cultural events like Ramlila and sometimes used for political and election rallies. It is divided into 6 wards. Places to See and Various Pastimes : The place of historical importance to visit is the Old Fort situated on a hill top. The fort is in a dilapidated state but still representative of family of Maharaja Sansar Chand Katoch. A place of religious importance is the old Shiva temple. The popular belief about the Shivalinga in the temple is that it grows every year by a height equal to one grain of rice. Another place of great religious significance for Sikhs is Gurdwara overlooking the river Beas. It was started after visit of Guru Gobind Singh to this place during Battle of Nadaun. Dhyanu Bhagat Samadhi present on the banks of River Beas it is the Samadhi place of great Saint and a Great Devotee of Maa Jwalamukhi. He made Akbar bow down before his belief. Hence Nadaun is considered a town of multiple-religions all living in mutual-harmony. A favorite pastime of people of Nadaun is evening walk to the Nadaun Bridge. There are many restaurants which have come up in this area. This Bridge provides fantastic views of Beas River and of sunset. This bridge separates Hamirpur district from Kangra district. Another interesting pastime is river- cruise in a small wooden boat. One can enjoy this ride the whole day. The boat is still used as a mode of transport. There is a statue of Freedom fighter Inder Pal in the New Bus stand area.  Education  Nadaun has been a center of education in this part of Hamirpur district. Until the late 1980s it was the only place in surrounding areas where one could get education till 12th grade. Educational Institutes : The oldest Educational institute of Nadaun is its Senior Secondary School for boys (Lala Jaganath Kamal Samarak Govt. Sen. Sec.). It has provided quality education to the students for over a century. Another major Educational Institute is Senior Secondary School for girls (Govt. Girls Senior Secondary School Nadaun). A government operated college (Sidharth Govt. College) was opened near to Nadaun in Gagal to cater the needs of higher education in this area. During recent time various privately operated colleges have come up in Nadaun and surrounding areas which offer lot of Bachelor Level courses. Nadaun also have DAV Public school. It has got a Kendriya Vidyalaya primarily meant for employees of Central Government of India. The District Institute of Education and Training of District Hamirpur located also in Tehsil Nadaun at village Gauna on distance of 6 km. There are some Kindergartens and privately operately Primary Schools in Nadaun. In 2017 few NRIs and eminent personalities of Nadaun started VedDhara Global School to impart quality education with international standards. Saregama Sangeet Academy is imparting musical education to budding artists and also conducts annual Basant Utsav festival with national level artists performing in Nadaun. Late Sh. Lokender kanwar, Dr. Hemraj, Dr. Lal Chand, Mr. Ritesh Kapoor, Mr. Narinder Thakur, Mr. Karam Chand, Dr. Nalini Vibha Nazali (author, poete, lyricist, painter, vocalist), Mr. Ajay Dogra are associated with Saregama Sangeet Academy and mentoring music and arts in Nadaun. Nadaun like many other parts of the country has seen a progressive shift to English as medium of education in most of the privately owned schools. Nadaun is famous also for having contribution to Indian Independence Movement. Lot of freedom fighters hailed from this part of the country.  Sports  Atal Bihari Vajpayee Stadium is a main cricket venue in the city which played host to many matches for Himachal Pradesh cricket team.

It extends over an area of some , covering five licence blocks. The five license blocks were 206/7, 206/8, 206/9, 206/12 and 206/15. History The Clair reservoir was discovered in 1977, with exploration well #206/8-1a penetrating a oil column in a thick sequence of Devonian to Carboniferous continental sandstone. In the 1980s ten appraisal wells were drilled. This activity demonstrated that the structure extended to an area of some with static oil-in-place, although it failed to confirm the presence of economically recoverable reserves. Two further wells were drilled in 1991, two in 1992 and one in 1995. Two of these wells (206/8-8 and 206/8-9z) demonstrated the potential for commercial flow rates but were not produced for long enough to give confidence in long term reservoir deliverability. In 1996 there was a breakthrough in the drilling and extended well testing (EWT) of well #206/8-10z. The EWT was followed by the side- tracking of an offset well into the pressure sink created by the EWT. The 1996 well test results set the scope for the 1997 drilling programme and triggered interest in a first phase of development. Two further wells were drilled in 1997 to appraise the 'Graben' and '3A' segments to reduce uncertainty in these areas adjacent to the core area. In May 1997 it was agreed by the Clair partners to jointly develop the field. BP was appointed as the operator and programme coordinator. A development plan was approved in 2001, representing an investment of ¬£650m by BP and its four partners in the project ‚Äì ConocoPhilips, ChevronTexaco, Enterprise, and Amerada Hess. The production facilities were installed in 2004. The first stage of the development was inaugurated on 23 February 2005. Development The first phase of development targets the 'Core', 'Graben' and 'Horst' segments of the southern area of the reservoir, which have , of which can be recovered. The development plan includes drilling of 15 producing wells, eight water injectors and one drill cuttings re-injection well. Plateau production is expected to be of oil and of gas. Noble Drilling and Wood subsidiary Mustang Engineering, part of the Wood Group, won the contract for Front-End Engineering Design (FEED). They proposed a single steel jacket with an integrated topsides deck with processing facilities, accommodation and a separate modular drilling rig. The steel jacket for Clair is located over the existing 206/8-10z well. The jacket is a four-legged single steel structure with a height of approximately . At its base, the jacket measures , has a height of , and a total weight of 8,800 tons. Both jacket and topsides are designed for fabrication, transportation and installation as single fully integrated lifts (maximum 10,500t) that require access to the heaviest lift capability vessels on the installation market. BP awarded the contract for the fabrication of the platform jacket to Aker Verdal. The contract for the construction of the platform topsides was awarded to AMEC. There are additional processing facilities for offshore power generation, water injection, produced water and cuttings re-injection, surplus gas disposal (export or re-injection) and flare gas recovery. Artificial lift is provided for all producing wells with the option of Electric Submersible Pumps (ESPs) for future well intervention. The operations will feature simultaneous drilling and coil tubing well intervention operations (SIMOPS). The topsides deck (including the flare boom) weighs 10,700 tonnes. Well fluids are first treated in two parallel separation trains.Process Overview schematic, undated After heating the well fluids are separated into three phases (oil, gas and produced water) in the two parallel High Pressure (HP) Separators. Oil from the HP Separators is further heated and passes to the two parallel 3-phase Low Pressure (LP) Separators. Oil then flows to the two parallel Electrostatic Coalescers which further separates water from the oil streams. The oil is cooled and flows to the oil export pumps, then through the oil metering skid and to the oil export pipeline. Although there are two separation trains there is only one common gas compression train. Gas from the LP separators is compressed in the vapour recovery unit and mixed with the gas from the HP separators. The combined stream is compressed in the LP and then the MP (medium pressure) compressors. Gas is dehydrated by counter-current contact with glycol in the Glycol Contactor. The dry gas stream is used as fuel gas on the platform. The remaining gas is further compressed in the HP compressor, it is used as gas lift on the oil production wells or, after gas metering, is exported via the export pipeline. Produced water from the separation train is treated and flows to the water injection wellheads. The contract to build the accommodation modules was awarded to Leirvik Module Technology. The accommodation contract involves the fabrication of the living quarters and utility building which have a weight of 1000 tonnes. The contract for the drill rig fabrication contract was awarded to Heerema Hartlepool. The scope of the fabrication work incorporates fabrication of a Derrick Equipment Set (DES) module, with substructure and skid base and a Drilling Support Module (DSM). The work includes equipment installation and extended commissioning and the modules weigh approximately 2000t and 2400t respectively. The entire structure has a design life of 25 years. A further development phase, called 'Clair Ridge', aims to develop other areas of the field with further fixed platforms. The field contains an estimated 8 billion barrels of oil, with an estimated 120,000 barrels per day production at peak levels. The UK government approved the ¬£4.5billion Clair Ridge development in October 2011http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/press/press- releases/4-5-billion-clair-ridge-project-receives-approval-for- development.html and production is scheduled to begin in 2016 and continue until 2050.http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/clair-ridge-project- shetlands/ The project involves the construction of a drilling & production platform bridge-linked to a living quarters & utilities platform, with pipelines to transport the oil and gas produced to Sullom Voe Terminal. BP and its partners awarded AMEC the contract for the engineering and project management for the main platform design,http://www.offshoreenergytoday.com/uk- amec-wins-clair-ridge-design-gig/ with Kv√¶rner constructing the platform jackets and Hyundai Heavy Industries constructing the topsides.

In 1532 Francisco Pizarro founded the town of San Miguel de Piura and began the conquest of the Inca Empire. Later in the same year, he captured the Inca king Atahualpa at Cajamarca. Atahualpa, seeing that the Spaniards cherished gold above all, promised to fill a room with gold and another equally large with silver in exchange for his freedom. Pizarro agreed to do this, although he likely had no intention to ever let Atahualpa leave. Before the room could be filled with gold, Pizarro's distrust of Atahualpa, and his influence over the many remaining Inca warriors, caused him to have the Inca garroted on July 26, 1533. The legend holds that the Inca general Rumi√±ahui was on his way to Cajamarca with an enormous amount of worked gold for the ransom when he learned that Atahualpa had been murdered. Accounts of the amount of gold involved varies in different versions of the legend, but all agree that on the news of Atahualpa's death, he sent the porters East to areas that are to the present day uninhabited and later returned to Quito and hauled more treasures, including tiles of the temple of the Sun and possessions of the √±ustas (temple dancers). The treasure is assumed to had been hidden in a cave, or dumped into a lake. Rumi√±ahui continued fighting against the Spanish, and though he was eventually captured and tortured, he never revealed the location of the treasure. The treasure they say was in the volcano as an act of freedom that‚Äôs the only way they could survive what was coming for the people.

It is located on Coimbatore-Gundalpet National Highway NH 67 of the Nilgiri Ghat Roads. History In the 19th century, when the British Straits Settlement shipped Chinese convicts to be jailed in India, the Chinese men then settled in the Nilgiri mountains near Naduvattam after their release and married Tamil Paraiyan women, having mixed Chinese-Tamil children with them. They were documented by Edgar Thurston. Alt URL Alt URL http://www.bulletin247.com/english-news/show/unravelling-chinese-link-can- boost-nilgiris-tourism Alt URL Paraiyan is also anglicized as \\"pariah\\". Edgar Thurston described the colony of the Chinese men with their Tamil pariah wives and children: \\"Halting in the course of a recent anthropological expedition on the western side of the Nilgiri plateau, in the midst of the Government Cinchona plantations, I came across a small settlement of Chinese, who have squatted for some years on the slopes of the hills between Naduvatam and Gudalur, and developed, as the result of ' marriage ' with Tamil pariah women, into a colony, earning an honest livelihood by growing vegetables, cultivating coffee on a small scale, and adding to their income from these sources by the economic products of the cow. An ambassador was sent to this miniature Chinese Court with a suggestion that the men should, in return for monies, present themselves before me with a view to their measurements being recorded. The reply which came back was in its way racially characteristic as between Hindus and Chinese. In the case of the former, permission to make use of their bodies for the purposes of research depends essentially on a pecuniary transaction, on a scale varying from two to eight annas. The Chinese, on the other hand, though poor, sent a courteous message to the effect that they did not require payment in money, but would be perfectly happy if I would give them, as a memento, copies of their photographs.\\" Thurston further described a specific family: \\"The father was a typical Chinaman, whose only grievance was that, in the process of conversion to Christianity, he had been obliged to 'cut him tail off.' The mother was a typical Tamil Pariah of dusky hue. The colour of the children was more closely allied to the yellowish tint of the father than to the dark tint of the mother; and the semimongol parentage was betrayed in the slant eyes, flat nose, and (in one case) conspicuously prominent cheek- bones.\\" Thurston's description of the Chinese-Tamil families were cited by others, one mentioned \\"an instance mating between a Chinese male with a Tamil Pariah female\\" A 1959 book described attempts made to find out what happened to the colony of mixed Chinese and Tamils.

The type and only species is A. steulleti. Andalgalornis is known from an incomplete skeleton and some single bones found from sites in the Entre R√≠os and Catamarca Provinces of northeast and northwest Argentina. The fossils were uncovered from the Late Miocene (Huayquerian in the SALMA classification) Ituzaing√≥ Formation of the Paran√° Basin.Paran√°, Pueblo Brugo to Diamante, Ituzaing√≥ Fm at Fossilworks.org Description Restoration Andalgalornis stood around one and a half meters tall. The subfamily to which the genus belonged, the Patagornithinae, contained species that were of quite slender build; it looked much like the larger phorusrhacid Phorusrhacos, but it was more elegant and smaller and had a proportionally higher beak, the most massive in proportion to body size of all phorusrhacids. A recent analysis of CT scans of the skull of Andalgalornis suggests that the beak was strong dorsoventrally (in the vertical plane) but relatively weak mediolaterally on either side. The beak's weakness has led some to suggest that the bird could not have taken down large prey, but consumed smaller, more easily manageable prey that could be killed with weak bite forces. However, the beak's dorsoventral strength may have enabled Andalgalornis to quickly strike down on or slash its prey in a hunting strategy that involves a series of repeated blows. This is analogous to the feeding behavior of other weak-biting predators such as Smilodon or Allosaurus, which also rely on vertical striking to kill large and dangerous prey. A study of its neck vertebrae showed that they were built for striking.

It is one of the Castelli Romani, at a distance of from Rome, in the Alban Hills. History The origin of the name Genzano is still disputed. According to one version, the hill overlooking the Lake of Nemi on which the city is situated was once devoted to the goddess Cynthia, whose cult was associated to that of Diana Nemorensis. Another version relates its origin to the Gentiani family. For others the presence on the hills, at that time of the \\"tribus or gens Cynthia\\" originators and custodians of the cult of courage, in \\"Castrum Gentianum\\" from them the derivation of the name Genzano. During the Roman empire the area was inhabited by wealthy Roman citizens who wished to benefit from the cleaner air, uncontaminated water and cooler temperatures during the hot summer months. The remains of many ancient Roman villas are to be found in the surroundings. The most impressive being the walls of the \\"Villa of the Antonini\\" where the later Roman emperor Antoninus Pius (r. 138-161 AD) was born. The Herculean Sarcophagus of Genzano, currently in the British Museum was found here. In the 12th century a tower of the Gandolfi family, lord of Castel Gandolfo, existed in the site. In 1183 Pope Lucius III gave it to the Cistercian monks of St. Anastasius of Aquae Salviae in Rome. In 1235 they built a large castle around which the town later grew. In 1378 the Popes assigned it to Giordano Orsini. The Cistercians and the Colonna alternatively ruled Genzano until 1563, when the castle was ceded for 150,000 scudos to the Massimi, from which it was bought by Giuliano Cesarini. Livia Cesarini, the last exponent of the family and wife of Francesco II Sforza, together with architect Giovanni Iacobini, designed and built Genzano Nuova (New Genzano) in 1708, according to the most modern urban planning of that time. The painter Maratti was one of the citizens who settled in Livia Sforza-Cesarini's new town. In 1873 it was decided that the name of the town should be changed to Genzano di Roma to avoid confusion within the postal service as there are two towns in Italy called Genzano. In the 19th and early 20th century it was seat of numerous peasant revolts; during World War II it suffered heavy damage under Allied bombings, which destroyed 90 percent of its buildings.

It is Located between the two roads from Lucknow city to Sultanpur and Raebareli. The distance between Lucknow and Nagram is 37 km. Raja Nal Pasi was the founder of Nagram. Its contemporary culture is the result of the amalgamation of the Hindu and Muslim rulers who ruled the town simultaneously and the credit for this goes to the secular and syncretic traditions of the Nawabs of Awadh, who took a keen interest in every walk of life and encouraged these traditions to attain a rare degree of sophistication. As a result, there are many historical holy religious sites in Nagram which are popular among all religions. Imambada Wajahat Hussain Rizvi is the Imambargah located in the center of Nagram, popularly knonwn as Syedwada. Anjuman e AbbasiyaAnjuman e Abbasiya Website is the oldest and existing anjuman of Nagram. Almas Ali Rizvi Grandson Of Late Zahid Ali Rizvi is an existing Zamindar. Geography Nagram is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Nagram added by Saurabhsulabh Singh It has an average elevation of 118 metres (387 feet). It is situated 37 km from Lucknow (capital of Uttar Pradesh). Nagram is a well-known place in the fields of literacy, education, art and culture, and social and political awareness. Mohalla Bangla is famous for its zamindars who used to live in this area in late 1800s. There are four main areas with Shia in the majority, like Sayedwada, Kothi, Bangla and Phulwari. Kothi is famous for its Late Rais Mir Fida Hussain, who was n prominent figured advocate and reformer who spent his life in developing the Shia beliefs, constructing mosques, shrines and other holy sites in this region and in 19th century, with the advent of British imperialism, he was bestowed with princely and royal title of Rais. Kothi is a great piece of architecture built by Fida Hussain, that served as the entrance to the Nagram. It is a mixture of Mughlai and Turkish style of architecture. However, the zamindari system was mostly abolished in independent India soon after its creation with the first amendment to the constitution of India. He had also institutionalised and streamlined the activities of Anjuman-e- Abbasiya and was instrumental in making it financially strong. Nagram has n history of Azadari which is done in great zeal. The Main religious activities of Azadari started from very first night of the month of Muharram till its end after two months and eight days, apart all other Mourning Days related to Masoomeen. Moreover, the Shiva temple of Nagram is n holy place of worship for Hindus. A fair on the occasion of Maha Shivratri is held every year with a huge gathering of Hindus coming from far off to attend the fair. It also has a Hindu temple named as Kali Mandir. The literacy rate amongst the people is considerably higher than other people living in the surrounding area. Due to unemployment, people of this town are compelled to work in metropolitan cities like Lucknow, Delhi or in the Middle East for their living. A substantial number of people work in the government sector. One of the important contributions of Moharram is that during this period Sayyid families return to Nagram from every nook and corner of India to pay homage to the supreme scarifies of Imam Hussain.

It includes meadows, woodland, riverside fields, formal rose gardens, a walled garden and a Japanese garden, as well as a children's playground, coffee shop, an orienteering course and many walks. It is owned and maintained by Belfast City Council's Parks and Amenities Section. On 14 July 2010, the park hosted annual International Rose Trials, the highlight of Rose Week, involving judges from around the world. Features The City of Belfast International Rose Garden in the Park has made it world-famous. In the summer it contains over 40,000 roses, divided into trial and display beds, a historical section and a heritage garden that displays the best roses from local breeders. It also has a Diana, Princess of Wales memorial garden. The rose garden and events like Rose Week attract thousands of visitors each year. The park also features International Camellia Trials. There are red and grey squirrels in the woodland. History The park was bequeathed to the people of Belfast in 1959 by Lady Edith Stewart Dixon and was dedicated to the memory of her husband, the late Sir Thomas Dixon. The first roses were planted in 1964 and the Trial roses were judged for the first time in summer 1965. A permanent panel of judges is provided by the Rose Society of Northern Ireland, formed by Craig Wallace in 1964. Wilmont House Wilmont House, in the grounds of the park, was built in the early 1760s by Scottish farming family the Stewarts, who were among the first to grow carrots on a large scale in the early 19th century. In 1811 an early threshing machine was erected on the property. The last Stewart associated with the house was James, who mortgaged the property to the Northern Banking Company in 1844, ending almost a century of family connections. The estate changed hands several times before James Bristow, a director of the Northern Banking Company, was granted a lease to the property in 1858. He commissioned the building of the present Wilmont House (in 1859), designed by one of Belfast's most important Victorian architects, Thomas Jackson. Bristow's initials are inscribed in stone on the north side of the house. The estate was sold to Robert Reade in 1897 following the deaths of the Bristow male heirs. After he died in 1913, his son sold it to Sir Thomas Dixon for ¬£21,500 in 1919. Dixon was a prosperous Ulster businessman who served as High Sheriff of Antrim and was knighted. Lady Dixon became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her work for the armed forces during World War I. Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, was a guest in 1935 and General Collins of the United States Army was billeted at Wilmont House during World War II. Sir Thomas Dixon died in 1950 and in 1959 Wilmont House and the estate was presented to Belfast Corporation ‚Äúfor the greatest good of the citizens of the City of Belfast‚Äù by Lady Dixon in memory of her husband. The park opened the same year. From 1963 to 1988 Wilmont House served as a nursing home. Lady Dixon died in 1964, aged 92. The fountain situated in the park was renovated and a new fountain commissioned for the Queen's Golden Jubilee year. The Walled Garden used to provide fruit and vegetables for the house, which has a dummy window, painted on the brickwork to balance the exterior.

Starting from the ancient Roman era, it was an area frequented by the noblemen of Rome for its fresher climate during summer: the tradition was followed by the Popes which still have their summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, on the Lake Albano. Families which ruled in the castles include Orsini, Colonna, Chigi, Aldobrandini, Savelli, Annibaldi and Ruspoli. Municipalities The Savelli Castle in Rocca Priora The Lake Albano.

It is a town and a nagar panchayat in Rewa district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It is notable for some monuments built by the Sengar clan, who ruled in the area before sovereignty. According to a survey, Naigarhi is one of the oldest inhabited villages in Madhya Pradesh.. History Thakur Gopal Sharan Singh of Nai Garhi, Madhya Pradesh The town of Nai Garhi which means a 'new fortress' was established by Raja Chattradhari Singh of Sengar dyansty. According to the history of the region, he was a scion of the Sengar clan of Rajputs that ruled over a little kingdom known as Mauganj which was previously known as 'Mau Raj'. The Sengar kings arrived in Mauganj from Jalaun in the eleventh century and ruled as independent kings until fourteenth century. However, a new clan of Rajputs famously known as Baghelas invaded Mau Raj, destroyed the fort of Sengars and established the rule of Baghelas in the region which came to be known as Bagelkhand. One of the scions of the defeated Sengars was Chattradhari Singh who eloped to the Nai Garhi region and constructed a new fortress. According to the bards, the fort was first set to be built upon a land adjacent to the temple of Astha-bhuja (a varying form of goddess Durga) but the prince saw a dream where the goddess was ordering him to move to a different location. He ordered his troops that at the time of dawn, they would spot a wolf chasing a wild hare and the place where the wolf hunts the hare will be the sanctified location for the new fortress. The troops saw the exact sightings as discussed by the prince and ultimately found the location to built their fortress. The family chronicles state that the fortress was built by Raja Chattradhari Singh and the marvelous main gate known as the 'Hathi Darwaza' was built by his son Raja Hathi Raj Singh. The rulers of this tiny principality maintained sovereign rule for a long period, however, they were unable to expand their dominion outside the circle due to the rising prowess of the Baghelas who established a cordial relationship with the Mughals and secured Bagelkhand by appointing numerous feudal lords. Essentially, the Sengars were still able to maintain their sovereignty until the arrival of the British in the region. Battle of Sathni and Itar In 1812, a group of Pindaris raided Mirzapur territory which forced the then king of Rewa, Raja Jai Singh to accede to a treaty with the British Raj. This first Anglo-Baghela treaty (1812) brought dissatisfaction in the region mostly among the Sengar Rajputs who started aggression against the British. In 1813, one Colonel Martindell reported in the region with a unit of Sepoys to quell the insurgency. A number of sepoys were killed and wounded at the behest of the Sengar Thakur whose headquarters was based in the village of Itar near Mangawan. This battle is still remembered in the folk song known as 'Itar ka Raisa'. At some instance, the estate of Naigarhi was confiscated by the British who decided to reissue it to the then Thakur Jagat Bahadur Singh of Naigarhi, if the latter agreed to pay his dues and attended the Dussehara ceremonies held in the Rewa Durbar. The Thakur agreed and in 1882 the estate was re granted to the Sengar clan. Aftermath The last feudal lord of Naigarhi was Thakur Gopal Sharan Singh. He was born in 1890 and went on to become a revered poet of Hindi poetry. The total worth of his estates were Rs. 90,000 per annum and an amount of Rs. 6,500 was paid to the Durbar. He was awarded the title of 'Kavi Ratna' or the 'Gem among Poets'. While residing in his Lal Kothi Mansion in Allahabad he build cordial relationships with great poets of his time like Maithili Sharan Gupt and Harivansh Rai Bachchan. The Higher Secondary School in Nai Garhi is named after him and every year a poet event is organised by the government in honor of Singh. Politics Naigarhi is under Deotalab vidhansabha. The first MLA of Deotalab was Thakur Someshvara Singh of Naigarhi which influenced the name and importance of Naigarhi in the regional politics. Naigarhi also started holding the Municipality elections. Education Naigarhi has a two government schools, boys and girls separate. The other private schools are regional board affiliated, Hindi mediums are Saraswati Shishu Mandir, Saraswati Gyan Mandir, Jeevan Jyoti, and an only English medium school is Lok Manya Tilak High School in Mahavirpur. The only college is named after Thakur Someshvara Singh comprising the studies of Arts and Commerce. Tourism Panchamandir Temple in Nai Garhi fort The tourism frequency of Naigarhi is very low due to its distance from highways. A couple of waterfalls, the most famous one in the small village of Bahuti which is some 5 km away from Naigarhi, the famous Maa Asthabhuja temple, the Naigarhi fort, the Panchmandir temple and the iconic view of a typical Indian village can be seen in Naigarhi. Inside view of the Nai Garhi Fort The Panchamandir is dedicated to Rama who is the main deity of the Sengar dynasty, Hanuman and Shiva. It resembles the fine stone carving art of the medieval India. There is also a temple dedicated to the goddess Kali which is located within the fort and is a popular tourist destination. Festivities and culture Apart from Durga Pooja in Dussherra, Diwali and Holi there is no festival which is celebrated here. But the Naigarhi fort has a reputation for decorating and celebrating Janamasthami with grandeur and holiness. Naigarhi fort also organises a holy feast called 'bhandara' in respect to the renovation of the Pancha-mandir temple in the precincts of the fort.

Biography Early years Feinstein was born in Milton, Massachusetts in 1931. He grew up in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He graduated from Boston University where he studied economics and journalism. After graduating, he wrote advertisements for a shoe company, but was unsatisfied with the experience. He attended Boston Teachers' College at night and taught elementary and junior high school in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. He married Dr. Pratarnporn Chiemwichit, a child psychiatrist, in 1963 and moved to Rhode Island. As part of an extended trip to Thailand in 1965, Feinstein had a private audience with King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The couple returned in 1966 and settled in Cranston, Rhode Island, where they still live today. He and his wife have three children: Leila Feinstein, a television news anchor KTLA; Ari, a salesman and entrepreneur in Washington DC; and Richard, a writer, who died in 2008. Business His booklet Making Your Money Grow was advertised in various publications and sold several hundred thousand copies. He built his newsletter and collectibles business buying mailing lists from brokers. He established two newsletters, International Insider's Report and The Wealth Maker which attracted circulation of 400,000. Feinstein offered collectibles, including coins and president autographs, as well as such items as a gold leaf-lined set of cards honoring Babe Ruth's 100th birthday issued by Guyana in collaboration with Feinstein. Feinstein also started a newspaper column which was widely syndicated. He wrote several self-published booklets: \\"How to Make Money,\\" \\"How to Make Money Fast,\\" etc. He also wrote a novel and several children's books which were published by A.S. Barnes/Yoseloff Publishing Company. In 1984, Prentice Hall published The Four Treasures of Alan Shawn Feinstein, a book written by a New York author, Milton Pierce. Much of Feinstein's wealth came from selling philatelic 'collectibles' through newsletters independent of the stamp collector community under a business model in which purchasers had a one-year money-back guarantee, including a \\"Face on Mars\\" stamp set issued by Sierra Leone promoted with a claim that the value of the stamps would soar once alien life was discovered on Mars, a claim which has garnered him criticism. Feinstein's stamps have been valued at prices lower than his newsletters predicted.Levitz, Jennifer. \\"Feinstein's universe - Alan Shawn Feinstein: You know the name, but do you know how he made his money?\\", The Providence Journal, march 21, 2004.

By 2008 over 125,000 children have been in his school program and are recognized as Feinstein Junior Scholars for promising to do good deeds for others. He was heavily involved in founding the first public high school with community service as its central focus, the Feinstein High School in Providence, named in his honor.Smith, Lynn. \\"'90s FAMILY At Feinstein, Youths Learn the Value of Volunteering\\", Los Angeles Times, December 21, 1994.

The focus of Feinstein's community service efforts has been in helping raise funds to fight hunger, which has included the annual \\"Feinstein Challenge\\", initiated in 1996, which encourages local organizations to raise funds with a portion of the amounts raised by the organizations matched by the foundation with $1 million distributed annually.Stacom, Don. \\"AGENCIES' FUNDING CHALLENGE FOOD CHARITIES' BURDEN GROWING\\", Hartford Courant, February 19, 2001.

Since its inception, his annual campaign every March and April has raised over $2.5 billion. Brandeis lawsuit In the early 1990s, Feinstein collaborated with Brown University to found the Feinstein World Hunger Program, a university research and teaching center dedicated to studying the causes of and possible solutions to hunger, which later moved to Tufts University. In 2000, he entered into an agreement with a Tufts professor, J. Larry Brown, to give $3 million to start another similar center at Brandeis University. A dispute between them developed and Feinstein sued Brown. In his lawsuit, Feinstein also accused Brown of defamation, a claim that was later dismissed. Westerly controversy  Initially offering $1 million to Westerly Middle School in Westerly, RI, Feinstein withdrew because of a controversy in the community over his requirement that the school be renamed for him. Feinstein said, \\"If it‚Äôs going to cause any friction whatsoever, I would rather withdraw the offer.\\" http://www.projo.com/education/content/FEINSTEIN_WITHDRAWS_WESTERLY_OFF_12-07-08_7PC_v9.382a501.html Baseball contracts In 1993, Feinstein spent $99,000 to purchase the contract by which the Boston Red Sox traded Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees, thus initiating the \\"Curse of the Bambino\\". In 2004, when the Red Sox won their first world series in over 80 years, Feinstein auctioned off this contract at Sotheby's for $996,000, giving the proceeds to anti-hunger agencies around the country. He recently purchased the contract that sent Ted Williams to the Red Sox in 1937. He plans to give the proceeds, when he resells it, to agencies fighting hunger. Feinstein is the honorary chairman of the World Scholar Athlete Games. He gave $1 million to construct their Hall of Fame building.

He has been awarded honorary doctorates by Providence College, Salve Regina University, Johnson & Wales University, Roger Williams University, Rhode Island College, the University of Rhode Island and the New England Institute of Technology. Several schools are named in his honor. The most recent, Alan Shawn Feinstein Middle School of Coventry (Formerly Knotty Oak) is named after him, after he donated 1 million dollars to the school, making community service a requisite there. IMAX lawsuit Feinstein had signed an agreement with IMAX in 2003 to name the firm's IMAX theater at the Providence Place Mall for his foundation. In exchange for a total of $1.4 million paid over five years, the theater would offer 50,000 free tickets to students participating in Feinstein's community service programs, offer discounted admission to students who have performed good deeds and donate a portion of these ticket sales to the Rhode Island Hunger Fund. The agreement was extended in 2005 with the stipulation that the naming rights would become permanent if all conditions were met. After the theater was purchased by National Amusements in January 2008, The Feinstein name was removed and the community programs were suspended. Feinstein filed a lawsuit against IMAX and National Amusements, but National Amusements asserts that its deal to purchase the theater included the furniture and equipment, but no other obligations. Imax settled with Feinstein out of court for an undisclosed amount. Mulvaney, Katie. \\"Feinstein in battle with IMAX\\", The Providence Journal, January 7, 2009. Accessed January 7, 2009.

The guy had graduated from my school two years earlier and was now a student at some place called the Rhode Island School of Design. He said it was an art school.\\" Wiesner currently resides outside of Philadelphia with his family. Career Wiesner's first book was Honest Andrew, a picture book with text by Gloria Skurzynski, published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1980. That year he also illustrated a novel by Avi, Man From the Sky (Knopf, 1980). After illustrating a dozen or more books with other writers, he and his wife Kim Kahng co-wrote Loathsome Dragon, a picture book with his illustrations that G.P. Putnam's published in 1987. Since then Wiesner has created many picture books solo‚Äîas writer and illustrator, or stories without words. Free Fall (Lothrop, Lee & Shepard, 1988) was a Caldecott Honor Book, a runner-up for the annual Caldecott Medal, conferred by the American Library Association on the illustrator of the year's best-illustrated picture book. Free Fall was the first example of the predominant style of his solo books, which tell a fantastical, often dream- like story without words, only illustrations. Subsequently he won three Caldecott Medals for solo picture books‚ÄîTuesday (1991), The Three Pigs (2001), and Flotsam (2006)‚Äîand he was one of the runners-up for Sector 7 (1999) and Mr. Wuffles!

History  From the year's 843 signing of the Treaty of Verdun, the location of the present commune fell within the territory of Middle Francia. Between 925‚Äì1542, it was part of the Duchy of Lorraine, within the Holy Roman Empire. From 1542-1766 it was in the independent Duchy of Lorraine. Between 1766-1871 it was incorporated into France. Periodic wars between France and Germany led to the establishment of the frontier along the river Moselle. Between 1871‚Äì1918 the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine, including Petite-Rosselle, was annexed by the German Empire. Following the Treaty of Versailles, Petite- Rosselle returned to French control and remained so until Nazi Germany again annexed the Moselle on 25 July 1940, incorporating it as CdZ-Gebiet Lothringen into the Gau Westmark. Petite-Roselle shares most of its history with Gro√ürosseln (). The united commune of Rosselle was founded in 1290, and the lesser and greater parts of the commune on either side of the river were legally separated in 1326. The river Rosselle marks the border between France and Germany.  Mining  Coal was discovered in the vicinity of the town in 1856 by the de Wendel family.

The Waterhouse Island Group includes the Waterhouse, Little Waterhouse, Swan, Little Swan, Cygnet, Foster, St Helens, Ninth, Tenth, Paddys, Maclean, and Baynes islands and the Bird Rock, and George Rocks islets with their associated reefs. Location and features The large inland portion of Waterhouse Island is privately owned under freehold tenure. On 28 September 2011, of the island was proclaimed as the Waterhouse Island Conservation Area. This conservation area surrounds almost all of the island from the low-water mark to approximately inshore, as well as a region at the northern tip. A small sandy spit on the eastern coastline does not appear to be encapsulated by this conservation area and the tenure of this sandy spit remains uncertain. A lighthouse is located on of crown land at the northern point of the island.http://maps.thelist.tas.gov.au/listmap/app/list/map Waterhouse Island has an equable Mediterranean climate with warm summers and cooler winters. Rainfall, averaging approximately per annum, is relatively evenly spread throughout the year, however with a bias to late winter months. Waterhouse Island has extensive white sand beaches on the eastern and south eastern shores. West and northern coasts are primarily rocky. The island is used as a haven for sheltering yachts and other small boats as they travel through Bass Strait. Surrounding waters are popular for fishing, both finfish and various shellfish. History and use Sealing is known to have taken place here from at least 1802. For the past 150 years the island has mostly been farmed, with sheep grazing the most prominent pursuit. The island has a house and a cottage, a four stand wool shed and implement shed, and a machine shed. The two dwellings are located in the lee of the prevailing westerly winds, on the eastern side, above sandy beaches. The island has a working wharf and two airstrips, one east‚Äìwest and the other intersecting it. Freight boats, including Bass Strait trading vessels, also can beach on protected East and southeast sand beaches. Until the 1970s, grazing activity led to some degradation of vegetation. The present owners, who have had it since that time, have fenced off vulnerable areas and have undertaken an extensive revegetation program. The grazing land vegetation primarily consists of introduced pasture grasses. Livestock grazing had previously caused erosion which had affected the shearwater colonies. These are now stabilised and the fairy penguin and the shearwater rookeries are thriving.Brothers, Nigel; Pemberton, David; Pryor, Helen; & Halley, Vanessa. (2001). Tasmania‚Äôs Offshore Islands: seabirds and other natural features. Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery: Hobart. Etymology The island is named after Captain Henry Waterhouse of the Reliance. Nicholas Baudin stopped at the island in 1802 mistakenly thinking the name meant fresh water could be found there, which was not the case. Fauna Recorded breeding seabird species are the little penguin and short-tailed shearwater. Introduced mammals include sheep, cats, fallow deer and house mice. Reptiles present include the metallic skink, spotted skink, three-lined skink, Bougainville's skink, White's skink and tiger snake.

It is located at foot hill of kolli hills is famous for its Lord Shiva temple, said to have been constructed by King Valvil Ori in the 1st or 2nd century. It is believed that the temple possesses a secret path to the Arapallishwarar (Lord Shiva temple) at top of Kolli hills, which is famous for medicinal herbal plants and natural honey The Kolli Hills are featured in several works of classical Tamil literature such as Silappathigaram, Manimekalai, Purananuru and Ainkurnuru. The region was ruled by Valvil Ori around 200 AD, who is praised as one of the seven great philanthropists of ancient Tamil Nadu. His valor and marksmanship are sung by several poets, and his exploits are a popular part of folklore. Ori is said to have killed a lion, bear, deer and a boar with a single arrow. The jackfruit grown on these mountains is known for its taste and fragrance and is often soaked in wild honey that is also harvested from these mountains. The mountains are covered by green vegetation in the spring and monsoon, and are streaked with streams. There are three reserved forests that are controlled by the Government of Tamil Nadu, namely Ariyur Solai, Kundur Nadu, Pulianjolai. It is not correct to regard the name kolli hills as being due to the incidence of deadly diseases such as malaria! It is because early literature records the existence of an image called kollippavai on top of these hills. This image was believed to represent the spirit of a maiden who lured wayfarers by her beauty and then killed them. The mountain is a site of pilgrimage, because of the Arapaleeswarar temple, which is believed to have a secret path to the Shiva temple in Rasipuram. This Shiva temple is said to have been built by Valvil Ori in the 1st or 2nd century when he ruled this area. \\"Arappaleeswara sathakam\\" is the poem which praises the Lord Arappaleeswarar. It is believed that this temple exists during the Sangam period itself.

The Nordic countries include Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway (including Svalbard), Sweden, and Scandinavia's associated autonomous territories (√Öland, Faroe Islands and Greenland). The majority of these nations and regions use North Germanic languages. Although majority of Finns speak Uralic languages, Finnish history and literature are clearly interrelated with those of both Sweden and Norway who have shared control of various areas and who have substantial Sami populations/influences. These peoples have produced an important and influential literature. Henrik Ibsen, a Norwegian playwright, was largely responsible for the popularity of modern realistic drama in Europe, with plays like The Wild Duck and A Doll's House. Nobel prizes for literature have been awarded to Selma Lagerl√∂f, Verner von Heidenstam, Karl Adolph Gjellerup, Henrik Pontoppidan, Knut Hamsun, Sigrid Undset, Erik Axel Karlfeldt, Frans Eemil Sillanp√§√§, Johannes Vilhelm Jensen, P√§r Lagerkvist, Halld√≥r Laxness, Nelly Sachs, Eyvind Johnson, Harry Martinson, and Tomas Transtr√∂mer. Medieval Scandinavian literature In medieval times Scandinavia shared first Proto-Norse and then Old Norse as a common language. The earliest written records from Scandinavia are runic inscriptions on memorial stones and other objects. Some of those contain allusions to Norse mythology and even short poems in alliterative verse. The best known example is the elaborate R√∂k runestone (ca. 800) which alludes to legends from the migration age. The oldest of the Eddic poems are believed to have been composed in the 9th century, though they are only preserved in 13th-century manuscripts. They tell of the myths and heroic legends of Scandinavia. Skaldic poetry is mostly preserved in late manuscripts but was preserved orally from the 9th century onwards, and also appears on runestones, such as the Karlevi Runestone. The advent of Christianity in the 10th century brought Scandinavia into contact with European learning, including the Latin alphabet and the Latin language. In the 12th century this was to bear literary fruit in works such as the Danish Gesta Danorum an ambitious historical work by Saxo Grammaticus. The 13th century was a golden age of Icelandic literature with Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda and Heimskringla. Danish literature The 16th century brought the Lutheran Reformation to Denmark and a new period in the nation's literature. Major authors of the time include the humanist Christiern Pedersen, who translated the New Testament into Danish, and Poul Helgesen who vigorously opposed the Reformation. The 16th century also saw Denmark's earliest plays, including the works of Hieronymus Justesen Ranch. The 17th century was an era of renewed interest in Scandinavian antiquities with scholars like Ole Worm at the forefront. Though religious dogmatism was on the rise the passionate hymns of Thomas Kingo transcended the genre with personal expression. External struggles with Sweden and internal rivalries among the nobility leading to Denmark's absolute monarchy in 1660 are chronicled from a royal prisoner's redemptive perspective in the heartfelt prose of Leonora Christina of the Blue Tower. Later Danish authors include Hans Christian Andersen, S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Johannes V. Jensen, and Karen Blixen. Faroese literature Faroese literature in the traditional sense of the word has only really developed in the past 100‚Äì200 years. This is mainly because of the island's isolation, and also because the Faroese language was not written down in a standardised format until 1890. In the Middle Ages many Faroese poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), √¶vintyr (stories) and kv√¶√∞i (ballads, often set to music and dance). These were eventually written down in the 19th century, providing the basis for a late but powerful literature. Finnish literature The history of Finland has been tumultuous. During much of recorded history the language of the government was different from that of the majority of the population. This had a strong influence on 'Finnish literature' with many of the greatest works revolving around achieving or maintaining a strong Finnish identity. The most famous collection of folk poetry is by far the Kalevala. Referred to as the Finnish national epic it is mainly credited to Elias L√∂nnrot although he worked more as an editor and compiler. It was first published in 1835 and quickly became a symbol of Finnish nationalism. The first novel published in Finnish was Seven Brothers (1870) by Aleksis Kivi (1834‚Äî1872): still generally considered to be one of the greatest of all works of Finnish literature. Icelandic literature The Icelanders' sagas ()many of which are also known as family sagasare prose histories describing mostly events that took place in Iceland in the 10th and early 11th centuries. They are the best known of specifically Icelandic literature from the early period. In late medieval times r√≠mur became the most popular form of poetic expression. Influential Icelandic authors since the reformation include Hallgr√≠mur P√©tursson, J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson, Gunnar Gunnarsson and Halld√≥r Laxness. Norwegian literature The period from the 14th century up to the 19th is considered a dark age in Norway's literature though Norwegian-born writers such as Peder Clauss√∏n Friis and Ludvig Holberg contributed to the common literature of Denmark-Norway. With the advent of nationalism and the struggle for independence in the early 19th century a new period of national literature emerged. The dramatist Henrik Wergeland was the most influential author of the period while the later works of Henrik Ibsen were to earn Norway an influential place in Western European literature. In the 20th century notable Norwegian writers include the three Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning authors Knut Hamsun, Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson and Sigrid Undset. Swedish literature Sweden ranks third in the list of countries with most Nobel Prize laureates in literature. Famous Swedish writers include Astrid Lindgren, Gustaf Fr√∂ding, Carl Jonas Love Almqvist, Vilhelm Moberg, August Strindberg, and Tomas Transtr√∂mer.

Life Cabibbo, son of a Sicilian lawyer, was born in Rome. He graduated in theoretical physics at the Universit√† di Roma \\"Sapienza University of Rome\\" in 1958 under the supervision of Bruno Touschek. In 1963, while working at CERN, Cabibbo found the solution to the puzzle of the weak decays of strange particles, formulating what came to be known as Cabibbo universality. In 1967 Nicola settled back in Rome where he taught theoretical physics and created a large school. He was president of the INFN from 1983 to 1992, during which time the Gran Sasso Laboratory was inaugurated. He was also president of the Italian energy agency, ENEA, from 1993 to 1998, and was president of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences from 1993 until his death. In 2004, Cabibbo spent a year at CERN as guest professor, joining the NA48/2 collaboration. Work The Cabibbo angle represents the rotation of the s^\\\\prime \\\\rangle}. The rotation angle is . Makoto Kobayashi Cabibbo's major work on the weak interaction originated from a need to explain two observed phenomena: *The transitions between up and down quarks, between electrons and electron neutrinos, and between muons and muon neutrinos had similar likelihood of occurring (similar amplitudes); and *The transitions with change in strangeness had amplitudes equal to one fourth of those with no change in strangeness. Cabibbo addressed these issues, following Murray Gell-Mann and Maurice L√©vy, by postulating weak universality, which involves a similarity in the weak interaction coupling strength between different generations of particles. He addressed the second issue with a mixing angle Œ∏C (nowIntroduced by Murray Gell-Mann and Maurice L√©vy, in and referenced by Cabbibo in his paper called the Cabibbo angle), between the down and strange quarks. Modern measurements show that . Before the discovery of the third generation of quarks, this work was extended by Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa to the Cabibbo‚ÄìKobayashi‚ÄìMaskawa matrix. In 2008, Kobayashi and Maskawa shared one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work. Some physicists had bitter feelings that the Nobel Prize committee failed to reward Cabibbo for his vital part. Asked for a reaction on the prize, Cabibbo preferred to give no comment. According to sources close to him, however, he was embittered. Later, Cabibbo researched applications of supercomputers to address problems in modern physics with the experiments APE 100 and APE 1000. Cabibbo supported attempts to rehabilitate executed Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, citing the apologies on Galileo Galilei as a possible model to correct the historical wrongs done by the Church. After his death in 2011, the Franklin Institute awarded him with the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Physics. Death He died from respiratory problems in a Rome hospital on August 16, 2010 at the age of 75. For his credits in physics, after his death, the great hall of La Sapienza's \\"Enrico Fermi\\" Physics New Department has been nominated after him in his honour.

The incorporated portion of \\"New Tampa\\" that lies within the city limits of Tampa is one of the largest city neighborhoods. The population has grown rapidly since being annexed by the city of Tampa in 1988. As of the 2000 census, the district had a population of 22,466. Many new master planned residential communities are planned or already under construction. Big-box stores are following the boom in population and are transforming this once rural area. \\"New Tampa\\" may also refer to a larger area that includes the area described above as well as parts of Wesley Chapel, an unincorporated area that abuts Hillsborough County to the north. Although neither technically nor officially part of the Tampa designated neighborhood New Tampa, most Tampa area residents identify the entire area as New Tampa.  Description  New Tampa is bounded by Lutz to the west, Wesley Chapel to the north, Morris Bridge Road (near Thonotosassa) to the east, and the University community and the University of South Florida to the south.  Demographics  As of the census of 2000, there were 22,466 residing in the district. 14,891 families, and 15,447 households. The population density was 936/mi¬≤. There were 11,143 housing units at an average density of 464.3/mi¬≤. The racial makeup of the district was 64% White, 21% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 15% Black, 11% Asian, less than 0.01% Native American, less than 0.01% Pacific Islander, 8% from some other race.http://www.hillsborough.communityatlas.usf.edu/demographics/default.asp?ID=1205707 NOTE: The demographic numbers exclude Pebble Creek, which is in unincorporated Hillsborough County. Population growth New Tampa has seen extraordinary growth in the past few years. The population rose from 7,145 residents in 1990 to 26,634 in 2000, an increase of 19,489 or 272.7%. The population was estimated at 37,350 in 2005. New Tampa is accounting for 52% of Tampa's citywide growth and is expected to continue. Housing units increased by 850 between 2004 and 2005 to a total of 15,340 and many new subdivision are being built which is causing the extraordinary growth.Microsoft Word - _popchg_7-06_Sec 1-pg_1-14.doc History Although first settled in the mid-19th century, New Tampa remained undeveloped until the late-1980s, when the city of Tampa annexed the area. Its oldest neighborhood being Pebble Creek with its oldest area residing within the Tampa city limits being Tampa Palms. Although originally developed when the area was still unincorporated, it did not thrive until the district boom of the 1990s. Most of the city's growth in the 1990s occurred in this district. Development The explosive growth of New Tampa, in both residential and commercial properties, has given rise to a great deal of confusion regarding the boundaries of New Tampa. For example, the annual \\"Taste of New Tampa\\" culinary event was held in Wesley Chapel, Pasco County, not because Wesley Chapel is a part of the New Tampa community, but due to the failure to find an acceptable location in New Tampa proper. The end result is that New Tampa and Wesley Chapel are separate communities. Another \\"growing pain\\" for New Tampa is the amount of infrastructure improvements being made to accommodate the area's rapid growth. Numerous residential developments, including high density housing (condominia, townhouses, etc.), continue to dot the landscape. Several retail outlets in the area have been completed (Shops at Wiregrass in nearby Wesley Chapel) or are under construction (Cypress Creek Town Center, near Wesley Chapel and Lutz). Roadways such as Bruce B. Downs Boulevard continue to deal with vehicle traffic well above the numbers the roadways were built to support, making for slower traffic movement in the area. Citizens groups continue to petition elected officials of both city and county offices for relief from these problems. Many major roadway improvements have recently begun and/or been completed. These include the widening of Cross Creek Blvd., the construction of the I-75 flyover ramp from the westbound traffic lane of Bruce B. Downs Blvd to the southbound lane of I-75. Roadway projects also in future city planning are the widening of Bruce B Downs Blvd from Bearss Ave. east to the County Line Rd. intersection and the construction of the highly debated East- West road to connect New Tampa Blvd. directly to I-275 south (to be located north of Livingston Ave Bridge and the Bearss Ave Exit).

The band is known for its intense live performances, classic rock production style, and association with authors Nick Hornby and Sarah Vowell and musicians Bruce Springsteen and Steve Earle.  History  Marah was formed by singer/songwriter/guitarist Dave Bielanko from Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, bass guitarist Danny Metz and drummer Ronnie Vance in 1993. Singer/songwriter/guitarist and harmonica player Serge Bielanko, Dave's older brother, joined the band in 1995. Several years before Marah formed, Serge and Dave Bielanko (still in high school) were in a band called the Lusty Toms with Michael Lepore, which had a far different sound that resembled the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The Lusty Toms never got signed and distributed several cassette tapes locally. Marah saw Serge and Dave alter their sound and musical direction. Marah featured Mummers Parade influenced banjos combined with standard rock music instruments to create a highly eclectic Roots Rock sound that drew comparisons to early Bruce Springsteen. Marah recorded two albums together: Let's Cut The Crap & Hook Up Later on Tonight, released on Black Dog Records in 1998, and Kids in Philly, released on Steve Earle's now-defunct E-Squared Records in 2000. Both critically acclaimed records were recorded and produced by the band and recording engineer/producer Paul Smith above an auto repair garage (Frank's Auto Body) in south Philadelphia. Metz and Vance left the band in 2000, and were replaced by Mick Bader on drums and Joe Hooven on bass. Augmented by Mike \\"Slo-Mo\\" Brenner on lap steel, this version of the group toured extensively to support Kids in Philly. Marah performed a song from that CD, \\"Point Breeze\\" on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 2000. Bader and Hooven left Marah in 2001 and were replaced by Jon Kois (drums) and Jamie Mahon (bass) of Philadelphia psychedelic rock band The Three 4 Tens. The Bielankos, with Kois and Mahon, left for Wales in late 2001 to record their third CD, Float Away With the Friday Night Gods with former Oasis producer Owen Morris and featuring Bruce Springsteen on vocals and guitar on the title track. It was released on Artemis Records in 2002. This release spurred controversy amongst the band's early supporters due to its decidedly Britpop sound. In 2003, Marah returned to the auto garage (Franks Auto Body, aptly renamed \\"The Marage\\") and recorded their fourth record, 20,000 Streets Under the Sky, and also played a series of shows in late October/early November, much to the delight of their devoted fan base. The CD was released on Yep Roc Records in 2004. The band toured to support this album with Jon Wurster (of Indie rock-stalwarts Superchunk) on drums, Mike \\"Slo-Mo\\" Brenner on Lap steel guitar, and Kirk Henderson on bass and keyboards. If You Didn't Laugh, You'd Cry and A Christmas Kind of Town In 2005, the band entered The Magic Shop recording studio in New York City to record their fifth album with the help of Henderson and two new members, guitarist Adam Garbinski and drummer/guitarist Dave Peterson formerly of the band Squad Five-O. The resulting disc, If You Didn't Laugh, You'd Cry (IYDLYC), met with near universal critical acclaim. Stephen King, writing in Entertainment Weekly, hailed IYDLYC as the best record of 2005. > If You Didn't Laugh, You'd Cry is an apt enough title, when you consider > that this is probably the best rock band in America that nobody knows. Am I > being an elitist here, trying to one-up my audience? Nope. Marah is great in > the scat, bop, and jive way Springsteen was great on The Wild, the Innocent > & the E Street Shuffle. One listen to songs like The Closer and Fat Boy on > this amazing record and I think you'll agree. These guys are either the > American U2 or close enough for government work. The release of IYDLYC was complemented by the recording and release of a Christmas album, A Christmas Kind of Town. The band, now solidified as a three-guitar quintet, embarked upon a year-long tour of the US and Europe to support the two albums. Highlights of the tour included Serge Bielanko's intense renditions of \\"Dishwasher's Dream\\" from IYDLYC as well as occasional performances of \\"Reservation Girl,\\" a song the group has never released on a record. In addition to the release of A Christmas Kind of Town, the band, along with keyboardist and vocalist Christine Smith, wrote and recorded music for lyrics written by This American Life contributor Sarah Vowell entitled \\"Christmas at Valley Forge.\\" The song, along with other selections from A Christmas Kind of Town, was originally aired on This American Life's Christmas special in December 2005 and was re-released on the holiday EP \\"Counting the Days\\" in 2007. Marah played at the Bonnaroo Music Festival on June 16, 2006. Performance highlights included a rousing introduction by St. Louis, Missouri scenester/character Beatle Bob and a cover of The Who's \\"Baba O'Riley.\\" Marah later played the Austin City Limits Music Festival on September 15, 2006, delivering a spirited set in which both Dave and Serge Bielanko jumped over the crowd barriers and into the audience. The audio of this show was released on iTunes on November 7, 2006. On September 21, 2006, the band released a DVD of a concert in Mataro, Spain (which was originally recorded and circulated as a fan bootleg) entitled Sooner or Later in Spain. Angels of Destruction Marah, with Christine Smith now a full-time member, entered Nashville's 16 Ton Recording Studios in August 2006 to record songs for a new record. In April 2007, the group recorded and mixed additional songs at Brooklyn, New York's Excello Recording. In June, Marah announced that the new record, Angels of Destruction!, would be released on January 8, 2008 and previewed the album at a concert/listening party in Philadelphia on September 8, 2007. Angels of Destruction! was preceded by a 6-song 10\\" EP entitled Can't Take It with You which was released in October 2007. A Christmas EP called Counting the Days was released in November 2007. The new album was released in early January 2008 to widespread acclaim. Almost immediately afterward, however, plans for an extensive US tour were canceled following the departure of Garbinski, Peterson, and Henderson, who all went on to form Adam & Dave's Bloodline. Bassist Johnny Pisano and drummer Joe Gorelick were hired as replacements, and in late February the band embarked on a European tour to promote the album. Serge Bielanko left the band shortly after the European tour to focus on family life. In August 2008, Dave Bielanko & Christine Smith started recording new material at 16 Ton Studios in Nashville with Pisano and Nashville-based drummer Martin Lynds who then joined the band. Bielanko had stated his intentions of recording \\"a lilting beautiful folky record of acoustic guitars, tack pianos, and the stand-up bass\\". Bielanko & Smith toured Europe with Pisano in December 2008 as a trio before returning to 16 Ton in January 2009 to continue work on the new album. In October, the band released the first new song from the 2009 recording sessions, the internet-only single 'Put 'Em In The Graveyard'. Life is a Problem \\"Life is a Problem\\" was released on June 22, 2010 through the band's own new label, Valley Farm Songs. As well as coming out on gatefold vinyl and digital download, the band took the unusual step of releasing it on cassette tape. In May, Dave Bielanko announced two new band members for their upcoming summer tour, Mark Francis Sosnoskie on bass and Bruce W. Derr on guitar. In October, 2011 Serge Bielanko returned to the band for U.S. shows at Jammin' Java in Vienna VA, and the Elk Creek Cafe in Millheim, PA, followed by a brief Spanish tour, but soon left again to focus on family life. Mountain Minstrelsy of Pennsylvania In February, 2014 Marah released Mountain Minstrelsy of Pennsylvania based on an obscure 1931 book with the same title. The book consists of a collection of song lyrics gathered in the mountains of Pennsylvania by folklorist Henry W. Shoemaker. Dave Bielanko and Christine Smith used the lyrics in Shoemaker's book as the basis for the songs on the album. Working in their studio in an old church in Millheim, Pennsylvania, the record was made on a Studer 8 track tape machine and mastered directly to a vinyl lathe. They also collaborated with an 11-year-old fiddle prodigy named Gus Tritsch, who plays on the album. 2015 \\"Reunion\\" Shows In July, 2015 the band announced that they would play a reunion show of sorts on October 17 at Underground Arts in Philadelphia to celebrate the 15th anniversary of their 2000 album Kids in Philly and that they would release a re-mastered edition of that album for the first time on vinyl. The re-formed lineup will include Dave and Serge Bielanko, Christine Smith, Adam Garbinski, Dave Petersen, and Mark Sosnoskie plus special guests Mike \\"Slo-Mo\\" Brenner, Jeff \\"Coolerman\\" Clarke and the Matt Cappy Horns. The band also announced two warmup gigs in advance of the Underground Arts show - one at Jammin' Java in Vienna VA on 7/23/15, and another at the Elk Creek Cafe in Milheim, PA on 10/10/15.

It extends for from an intersection with NY 364 in the Yates County town of Potter to a junction with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) and NY 5 in the Ontario County town of Hopewell. In between, NY 247 serves the village of Rushville and it overlaps with NY 245 for from Rushville to Gorham. NY 247 was originally assigned to modern NY 53 from Prattsburgh to Naples in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, what is now NY 247 became part of NY 53\\\\. The alignments of the two routes were mostly swapped north of Prattsburgh in the early 1940s, placing NY 247 on its current alignment. Route description NY 247 north from NY 245 in Gorham NY 247 begins at an intersection with NY 364 in a creek valley northwest of the hamlet of Potter. While NY 364 runs east‚Äìwest across the base of the valley, NY 247 heads to the northwest, paralleling NY 364 for as it gradually climbs the northern side of the gully. After reaching the top of the valley, NY 247 curves to the north and begins the north-south alignment that most of the remainder of the route follows. Continuing north, it traverses of open farmland on its way to the village of Rushville, located in both Yates and Ontario counties. NY 247 follows South Main Street through the Yates County portion of the village to Rushville's central business district, where it meets NY 245 at Gilbert Street. NY 245 joins NY 247 here, and both routes follow North Main Street into Ontario County. Across the county line, the routes fork from North Main Street near the northern village line to follow Gorham Road northeast through the town of Gorham. After another of open farmland, NY 247 splits from NY 245 at a point known as Baldwin Corners. While NY 245 continues northeast toward Geneva, NY 247 heads north on a linear north-south alignment. This path takes NY 247 across another of cultivated fields to the small hamlet of Reed Corners, centered around the junction of NY 247 and County Road 18\\\\. Past Reed Corners, NY 247 traverses slightly more populated areas as it enters the town of Hopewell, the last town along the route. NY 247 ends just north of the town line at an intersection with US 20 and NY 5 southeast of Canandaigua. History NY 247 in Reed Corners The portion of modern NY 247 between Potter and Rushville was originally designated as part of NY 52, an east‚Äìwest route extending from Dansville to Geneva via Naples and Middlesex, in the mid-1920s. From Naples to Geneva, NY 52 mostly followed what is now NY 245. NY 52 was realigned in the late 1920s to follow current NY 245 from Middlesex to Rushville, bypassing modern NY 364 and NY 247. Although all of what is now NY 247 was state-maintained by 1926, no other designations were assigned to the highway until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931).

The current alignment of NY 247 was simultaneously designated as the northernmost portion of NY 53, which originally followed a series of north‚Äìsouth roads between Prattsburgh and Potter. NY 53 was realigned in the early 1940s to follow NY 247 from Prattsburgh to Naples. As part of the change, NY 247 was reassigned to the portion of NY 53's former alignment north of NY 364 in Potter.

The church was founded by Michael Reid, who served as pastor of the church until stepping down in 2008, following various controversies. It is currently led by its former assistant pastor, Peter Linnecar.  Doctrine  Peniel Church described itself as an independent Pentecostal Christian church. Over the years, it aligned itself with and subsequently distanced itself from a number of Christian organisations, including the Assemblies of God and the International Communion of Charismatic Churches (ICCC). For a time the church was a member of the Evangelical Alliance (EA), but disputes between the EA and the leadership of the church resulted in the church leaving the EA. Under the new leadership, it has now been welcomed back into the EA. Due to the patriarchal values of the church, women in the Peniel Church were obliged to dress in clothes that were seen as 'feminine', such as dresses and skirts.  Leadership  Michael Reid The church's founder, Michael Reid, is a former Metropolitan police officer and insurance salesman, and was made a bishop by the International Communion of Charismatic Churches in Benin City, Nigeria in 1995.Martin Bell, the white-suited 'ethics man', turns Essex man to contest general election, Dec 9, 2000, The Independent The Rev Peter Linnecar, Reid's senior pastor, and long-time business partner for more than 25 years, took over Mr Reid's responsibilities at the church during 2008. A group of eight lay-people act as the leadership team, while a further group of trustees has legal responsibility for the church's charitable status.  Controversy  Controversy has surrounded Reid for many years and both he and Peniel Pentecostal Church have been the subject of many critical media articles.\\"In the name of the Father\\", Paul Vallely The Independent, 20 February 2001 In 2001, the church received national publicity when Martin Bell stood for Parliament for Brentwood and Ongar constituency following allegations that the church were attempting to infiltrate the local Conservative Party.\\"Never send to know for whom the Bell tolls\\", The Guardian, 23 May 2001\\"Bell prepares to stand against evangelical Conservatives\\", The Guardian, 8 December 2000 The allegations were investigated by Conservative Central Office who reported that they saw no evidence of entryism.\\"The oracle of Essex\\", The Guardian, 15 November 2000 Some former church members have claimed the church is a cult, and relate experiences of poor treatment prior to and on their departure from the organisation.\\"Bell agrees to fight Tory safe seat in Essex\\", The Guardian, 9 December 2000\\"Sects, power and miracles in the Bible belt of Essex\\", The Observer, 31 December 2000\\"Church sued over 'undue influence'\\", The Guardian, 3 February 2001 In 2004, all the other churches in the Brentwood and District Evangelical Fellowship (BADEF) resigned in protest against Peniel, leaving it as the only member.\\"Local MP Pickles has to answer questions says Lib Dem PPC\\", Brentwood & Ongar Liberal Democrats, 23 November 2004 The church is no longer a member of the Evangelical Alliance, having left the group following controversial circumstances in 2005. In February 2008 the Advertising Standards Authority upheld a complaint that a mobile advertisement for Christian Congress of Traditional Values (CCTV), an organisation with ties to Peniel Pentecostal Church, was \\"likely to cause serious or widespread offence or condone anti-social behaviour\\". The advertisement bore the slogan \\"Gay aim: abolish the family\\", implying that gay people were against the institution of the family and family values.The Christian Congress for Traditional Values'Family values' poster banned by ASA Media guardian.co.uk Peniel Church had more lately been publicised as 'Michael Reid Ministries', although the church retained the Peniel name for its college, school and choir. The college was closed in 2009.  Crisis  The church was temporarily thrown into crisis when it came to light that Reid had been having an affair with a member of the choir. On 5 April 2008, Michael Reid tendered his resignation from the church board and stepped down from pastoral duties.Resignation announcement on homepage of Michael Reid Ministries At an industrial tribunal where Reid was claiming unfair dismissal it emerged that there was a second woman who also claimed to have had a relationship of \\"many years\\" with Reid, which involved a \\"possible abuse of his position.Brentwood Gazette newspaper article about Reid's adultery Following these events, CCTV disbanded in August 2008, and Global Gospel Fellowship (GGF) appears to have likewise folded. Reid was arrested on 27 August 2009 on suspicion of historical rape.Metro newspaper article about Reid's arrest Further to the exposure of the affair, stories of emotional bullying and manipulation by Reid began to emerge from many members of the congregation. The church appeared to have weathered the storm caused by Reid's extra-marital affairs, but trouble flared up again in 2009 when head pastor Peter Linnecar's appointment of assistant pastors caused controversy and disagreement amongst a large section of the congregation. Approximately 300 people left the church as a result. The church subsequently stated that it is now thriving under the new leadership. The church is now called Trinity Church.

DDA has been accused of corruption in allotting plots by using a population survey from 1972. By 2007 the families in the 1972 survey had grown and the single plot leads to loss of valuable land. Plots were a maximum plot size of 650 meters square. The government displaced the entire village without paying for construction.

The center features more than 900 species of native Texas plants in both garden and natural settings and is home to a breadth of educational programs and events. The center is 284 acres and located 10 miles southwest of downtown Austin, Texas just inside the edge of the distinctive Texas hill country. It straddles both Edwards Plateau and Texas Blackland Prairies ecosystems. The center is dedicated to \\"inspiring the conservation of native plants\\" and promoting the environmental benefits of native plant landscapes. It is home to the most comprehensive native plant database in the U.S., which features profiles of more than 9,000 North American native plants along with a number of other resources (see Native Plants of North America). The Wildflower Center has 9 acres of cultivated gardens, including the Luci and Ian Family Garden and the Ann and O.J. Weber Pollinator Habitat Garden. Its 16-acre Mollie Steves Zachry Texas Arboretum features collections of tree and shrub species from across the state of Texas. Miles of walking trails, educational exhibits, a gift store, cafe and biannual sales of native plants round out the offerings. In 2013, the syndicated television series, Texas Country Reporter, hosted by Bob Phillips, declared the center the No. 1 site from which to view wildflowers within Texas. History Former first lady Lady Bird Johnson and actress Helen Hayes founded the National Wildflower Research Center in 1982 to protect and preserve North America's native plants and natural landscapes. The original center was located on a 60-acre site in East Austin. Public demand to view native gardens and learn more about native plants soon overwhelmed the original site, and led the Board of Directors to build a larger campus to accommodate public interest. The current campus opened in 1995 on a 42-acre site in Southwest Austin on La Crosse Avenue. Five acres of native plant gardens and landscapes, designed by J. Robert Anderson, FASLA (principal), Eleanor McKinney (EMLA) and Darrel Morrison (FASLA), were installed throughout a complex of award-winning buildings designed by Overland Partners to reflect the land and regional architecture of the Texas Hill Country. The center was officially renamed the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in 1997. By 2002, in response to rapidly encroaching land development, the center acquired an additional 237 acres of adjacent land through purchase and donation. This expansion of the campus made possible the development of larger scale research on the ecology of the Central Texas region and how best to restore healthy landscapes in the region. It also established education and public outreach as core functions of the center. The inscription on the Presidential Medal of Freedom award presented to Lady Bird Johnson in 1977 by President Gerald Ford concludes with the words \\"Her leadership transformed the American landscape and preserved its natural beauty as a national treasure.\\" The Wildflower Center joined The University of Texas at Austin in 2006 (see below). With its focus on native plants, research and education, the Wildflower Center has gained national recognition as a leader in plant conservation and environmental sustainability. In partnership with the U.S. Botanic Garden and American Society of Landscape Architects, the center led the Sustainable Sites Initiative, a program that established performance benchmarks for sustainable land design and is now offered through GBCI. Mission The current mission of the center is \\"inspiring the conservation of native plants.\\" Incorporation and Development On June 20, 2006, the University of Texas System Board of Regents announced a plan to incorporate the Wildflower Center into The University of Texas at Austin. In 2010, a donation of $1.4 million from the San Antonio Area Foundation was designated toward the establishment of a 16-acre arboretum. The Mollie Steves Zachry Texas Arboretum, which was dedicated on April 30, 2011 and opened in the spring of 2012, displays all 53 species of oak trees that are native to Texas. In April 2012, Luci Baines Johnson, daughter of Lady Bird Johnson, and her husband Ian Turpin donated $1 million toward a family garden that will be named in their honor. The 4.5-acre native plant garden features a wading creek, a maze of 3-foot-tall native hedges, and a walk-in grotto. It was opened in May 2014.

Biography William Howard Armstrong was born in Lexington, Virginia in 1911 during the worst hailstorm and tornado in the memory of his neighbors. He was the third child born to Howard Gratton Armstrong, a farmer, and his wife, Ida Morris Armstrong. He had a difficult time in school, being a small child with asthma and glasses.About William H. Armstrong at Scholastic While his father taught him to work hard, his mother taught Armstrong to love stories. \\"No one told me the Bible was not for young readers, so I found some exciting stories in it,\\" Armstrong said. \\"Not until years later did I understand why I liked the Bible stories so much. It was because everything that could possibly be omitted [left out] was omitted. There was no description of David so I could be like David...\\" Armstrong later used the art of omission in his own writing of Sounder which he wrote based on an account told around his family's kitchen table in Virginia. One story in particular, told by an elderly black man about Argus, the faithful dog of Odysseus, fascinated him; the dog recognized his master when he returned home after being away for twenty long years. This story stayed with him throughout his life and ultimately was the inspiration for his award-winning children's book, Sounder. After growing up on a farm near Lexington, Armstrong graduated from the Augusta Military Academy.imdb He attended Hampden-Sydney College, where he wrote for the college newspaper and edited its literary magazine. Armstrong graduated cum laude in 1936, then continued his higher education with graduate work at the University of Virginia. He farmed in Connecticut near the Housatonic River, also learning to be a carpenter and a stonemason.Children's Literature Network In 1945, he became a history master at Kent School in Kent, Connecticut, where he remained for 52 years,Harper Collins teaching general studies, classics, and ancient history to generations of ninth grade students. Armstrong was loved, admired, and feared by his students. A truly formidable character and head of \\"study hall\\", he suffered no fools lightly. More than once he was known to send a textbook flying across the classroom with unerring accuracy to awaken one inattentive student or another. In 1956, at the request of his school headmaster, he published his first book, a study guide called Study Is Hard Work. Armstrong followed this title with numerous other self-help books, and in 1963 he was awarded the National School Bell Award of the National Association of School Administrators for distinguished service in the interpretation of education. In 1969, Armstrong published his masterpiece, an eight-chapter novel titled Sounder about an African-American sharecropping family. Praised by critics, Sounder won the John Newbery Medal and the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1970, and was adapted into a major motion picture in 1972 starring Paul Winfield and Cicely Tyson. Despite its success, it was criticized by some African-Americans because they claimed that a white writer couldn't really understand their experience.Children's Literature Classics Moreover, it reinforced the idea that self-help and limited non-material advancements were sufficient to ameliorate structural poverty in the American South. Among his other novels are The Sour Land, a sequel to Sounder, though not labeled as such, The Mills of God and The MacLeod Place, the story of a multi-generational family farm displaced by the construction of the Blue Ridge Parkway. By the mid 1970s, enriched by earnings from Sounder, Armstrong was thoroughly ensconced in Kent School. He raised sheep for passover on a beautiful hillside piece of property provided by the school and reportedly charged Kent $1 per year for his academic services.

History The Nanpara Taluqdari was one of the taluqdaris (feudatory states) in British India. The title of \\"Raja\\" was conferred on the Nanpara House in 1763 by the Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula, the King of Oudh and has then recognized by British. With holding of 439 villages it was the largest Muslim taluqdars (landowners) in British India. Nanpara was an important frontier estate, bordering Nepal territory in the Bahraich district of Oudh. Of the 439 villages, 438 were in the Bahriach district and one in the Barabanki district. It comprised an area of 468 sq miles, or about the same area of the then former German principality of Lippe. In 1914‚Äì15 The gross rental of the estate amounted to over rupees 12,00,000 and the government demanded land revenue and cesses of rupees 2,80,000. Taking a population of 350 person per sq miles [it was estimated that was the district average in the census of 1911] the estate contained a population of over 154,000. In 1632, Rasul Khan, a Pathan. received a commission from the Emperor to subdue the Banjaras; and obtained for his services and for the pay of his troops, the grant of Nanpara and four other villages in Pargana Solonabad, in addition to one-tenth of the rent of the disturbed territory. Rasul Khan lived at Kummaria in Bundi, and both him and his son Jahan Khan, who succeeded him, are buried there. Jahan Khan's successor, Mohammad Khan, was the first to settle in Nanpara. Mohammad Khan's son and successor, Karam Khan, was so successful against the Banjaras that he gained amongst the country folk the title of Raja, which was confirmed by Nawab of Oudh Shuja-ud-Daula in 1763, and was recognised as hereditary by the then British Government of India in 1877. This was because this area was home to the Nanpara and Utraula principalities, both of which are now situated in Bahraich and Balrampur District, which was the centre of the largest Pathan settlement outside Rohilkhand.

This time round there are tales of a ghostly hound out on the moors accompanying an equally ghostly carriage. And naturally, the story is populated with sinister local characters. The moor is central to the story, brooding over it as the moor broods over the surrounding landscape. It also has Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould as a central character. He has a strong intellectual curiosity and is the driving force behind the investigation. Laurie King uses many of the elements of The Hound of the Baskervilles. These elements are introduced deliberately on the part of the criminals and there are echoes of the original story. The way that Holmes reacts to the many mentions of the original case, with a mixture of pride and exasperation, allows for some very humorous moments.

A follow-up to the original Baseball Stars on Nintendo Entertainment System, it was one of the launch titles for both the Neo Geo MVS (arcade) and Neo Geo AES (home) platforms, in addition of also being one of the pack-in games for the AES, as well as the first baseball title released for the Neo Geo. In the game, the players compete with either computer- controlled opponents or against other players in matches across various ballparks. Although it was originally launched for the Neo Geo MVS, Baseball Stars Professional would be later released for both Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo CD in 1991 and 1995 respectively, in addition of being re-released through download services for various gaming consoles, among other ways to play it as of date. Baseball Stars Professional garnered mixed reception from critics upon its original release, with reviewers praising various aspects of the game such as the presentation, visuals and quality of the digitized voice samples but many were divided in regards to the gameplay.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot showcasing the player's batter about to hit the ball. Baseball Stars Professional is a baseball game similar to the original Baseball Stars and other similar golf titles from the era, where players compete in matches against computer-controlled opponents or other players across two ballparks.Baseball Stars Professional user's manual (Neo Geo AES, US) There are only two modes featured in the game: Tournament is the main single-player mode where one player compete against CPU-controlled opponents in a season. Versus, as the name implies, is a two-player mode where two people compete against each other. Most of the original teams featured in the first Baseball Stars return in this game, however some of the features within the first game were removed for a more arcade-style approach of the sport, such as team management and the ability to create a new team from the ground up, among others. If a memory card is present, the players are allowed to save their progress and resume into the last match the game saved at through a password system.  Development and release  Baseball Stars Professional was initially launched for arcades on 26 April 1990 and holds the distinction for being the first baseball game to be developed for the Neo Geo platform. The game was also released during the same period for the Neo Geo AES, when the system was originally a rental-only system for video game stores and hotels in Japan, but this was later reversed due to high demand and price, coming into the market as a luxury console on 1 July 1991. It was re-released for the Neo Geo CD on 21 April 1995, with minimal changes compared to the original MVS and AES versions. The game has received multiple re-releases in recent years on various digital distribution platforms such as the Virtual Console, PlayStation Network, Nintendo eShop and Xbox Live.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Baseball Stars Professional on their December 15, 1990 issue as being the fourteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Palamedes. Baseball Stars Professional received mixed reception from critics after its initial launch. Famicom Ts≈´shin scored the Neo Geo CD version of the game a 21 out of 40.

Textual notes  The name \\"Askepot\\" was used in the first edition (1843), where the tale was entitled \\"Om Askepot, som stjal Troldets S√∏lv√¶nder, Senget√¶ppe og Guldharpe\\". The name was changed to Askeladden in the 2nd edition (1852), but only in the title, and the name remained Askepot throughout the story. This was rectified in later issued editions. The tale has been translated as \\"About Ash Lad, Who Stole the Troll's Silver Ducks, Coverlet, and Golden Harp\\" by Tiina Nunnally, and as \\"Boots and the Troll\\" by Dasent (1859). Synopsis An old man burned in hell. His three sons set out to seek their fortune. The two older would have nothing to do with the youngest son, whom they said was fit for nothing but to sit and poke about in ashes. The youngest brought a kneading-trough, the only thing their parents had left behind, which his brothers had not bothered with. His brothers got places under the coachman and gardener at the royal castle, and he got one in the kitchen. He did so much better than they did that they became envious and told the coachman that he had said he could get for the king seven silver ducks that belonged to a troll, and which the king had long desired. The coachman told the king. When the king insisted that he do it, he demanded wheat and rye, rowed over the lake, in the kneading trough, to the troll's place, and lured the ducks into the trough using the grain. Then his brothers told the coachman he had said he could steal the troll's bed-quilt, and the coachman again told the king. He demanded three days, and when he saw the bed-quilt being hung out to air, he stole it. This time, the king made him his body-servant. His brothers told the coachman he had said he could steal the troll's golden harp that made everyone who heard it glad, and the coachman again told the king. He said he needed six days to think. Then he rowed over, with a nail, a birch-pin, and a taper-end, and let the troll see him. It seized him at once, and put him in a pen to fatten him. One day he stuck out the nail instead of his finger, then the birch-pin, and finally the taper-end, at which point they concluded he was fat enough. The troll went off to ask guests to come, and his daughter went to slaughter the youth. He told her the knife wasn't sharp enough, sharpened it, and suggested testing it on one of her braids; when testing, he cut off her head and then he roasted half of her and boiled the other, as the troll had said he should be cooked. He sat in the corner dressed in her clothing, and the troll ate his daughter and asked if he didn't want any. The youth said he was too sad. The troll told him to get the harp, and where it was. The youth took it and set off in the kneading trough again. The troll shouted after him, and the youth told him he had eaten his own daughter. That made him burst, and the youth took all the troll's gold and silver, and with them won the princess's hand in marriage and half the kingdom. And then his brothers were killed by boulders when they went up a mountain. Analysis The tale has been categorized as Aarne-Thompson type 328 \\"The Boy Steals the Giant's Treasure\\".

A saxophone player and vocalist, Hurt was a singer with the Vincent Lopez band and on records with Frank Trumbauer's jazz group before becoming part of a vocal trio with Bud and Gordon Vandover billed as \\"Tom, Dick, and Harry\\". When the act was dissolved due to Bud Vandover's death in 1943, Hurt became a solo performer with a combination of saxophone and dialect humor. Beulah begins Hurt's inspiration for the Beulah voice was an African-American woman named Mary who cooked for his family. While he was using this characterization on The Fred Brady Show, the summer 1943 replacement for The Bob Burns Show on NBC, Fibber McGee writer Don Quinn \\"discovered\\" Hurt for a widespread audience, and cast Hurt/Beulah as the McGees' maid on what was one of the highest rated radio programs. The widespread popularity of the Fibber McGee and Molly version of Hurt's character, based as much on the novelty of a white man portraying a black woman as the humor written for the character, soon warranted a spin-off series. In 1945, Beulah was spun off into her own radio show, The Marlin Hurt and Beulah Show; Hurt also played Beulah's boyfriend, Bill Jackson, in addition to his title roles. The series was nearing the end of its first year when Hurt suddenly died of a heart attack, aged 40, bringing an abrupt end to the initial run.Stumpf, Charles and Tom Price. Heavenly Days!

A less detailed console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year. Neo Geo version Gameplay screenshot from the original Neo Geo version. You can select from one of 18 teams across two leagues: Exciting League (beginner) & Fighting League (expert). It featured 18 teams across 2 leagues (Exciting League and Fighting League) and put more emphasis on the graphics and the gameplay; for example, being able to change pitchers or batters and powering up batters which increased the size of the bat.Baseball Stars 2 user's manual (Neo Geo AES, US) NES version Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992. Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: *Female players are no longer included in any form. *Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players *Enhanced pitch control. *Ability to shift field formations when playing defense. *Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game. *Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired. *Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.) *Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting. *Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each. *New music and home run animations. These include the \\"Power connect\\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a West highland white terrier following the batter for a come-from- behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation. *Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams *You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5 *Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum. *You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name. Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders. The last pitcher listed on any user-created team in \\"View Team\\" does not appear in any of the Top 10 leaderboards.)

The first issue of GameFan reviewed the Neo Geo version, with its two reviewers scoring it 99% and 97%; the former said it \\"is far and away the best sports game I have ever played\\" and the latter said the \\"graphics are incredibly well detailed\\" and \\"the gameplay is unparalleled.\\" They concluded that it \\"has the best graphics, sound, and game play this side of ESPN.\\"GameFan, volume 1, issue 1 (October 1992), pages 7 & 49 The NES version was less popular than the original Baseball Stars was on the NES. Reasons for this included the inability to change the name of a gamer-created team or names of the players on a gamer-created team, and unimproved graphics over the original. A Nintendo Power review wrote \\"Baseball Stars 2 is such a complete rehash that if you already own the original, it is not worth your money to get this game.\\"  Re-releases  The game was included in the SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1 compilation by SNK Playmore for PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii, released on 2008.

He is notable for his contributions to Linear B studies and for his attempts to coordinate the efforts of academics to decipher Linear A. Biography Owens read Classics at University College London, completing a master's thesis on Linear B and a thesis on the problem of Linear A for his Ph.D. in archaeology. He has taught at London and at the University of Crete and has authored several publications in both English and modern Greek. Owens is married to a Greek archaeologist (Kalliope Nikolidaki) with whom he frequently collaborates. He has earned the Modern Greek Diploma of Proficiency from the National and Capodistrian University of Athens where he took a second Ph.D. in linguistics. Owens applied for and was granted citizenship. In fulfilling his obligations as a male Greek citizen, Owens briefly served in the Hellenic Army. In addition to his academic postings, Owens has worked as a translator for the BBC and taught English on Crete. Recently, Owens served as the professor for the Sigma Phi Epsilon 2010 Tragos Quest and taught Greek literature and history to 16 of the fraternity's top leaders. Linear A Owens postulates that the phonetic values of ninety-percent of Linear A characters correspond to those of Linear B figures of similar appearance. A full ten characters do not admit analysis in terms of Linear B, and Owens can only speculate about their meaning. Using his system of correspondences, Owens has uncovered several place names which appear in the Linear B tablets and figure prominently in the archaeological history of Crete. In addition, he believes that he has found evidence of grammatical gender for nouns and nomen agentis, as well as vocabulary and noun and verb endings that to him indicate the underlying \\"Minoan\\" language of the Linear A tablets to be an Indo- European language of the Satem branch. Owens has founded the Daedalic Theme Network to foster collaboration on Linear A decipherment and other Minoan issues.

The band was conceived primarily as a recording project whose musical agenda saxophonist Andy Blake described as \\"to develop a post- minimalist musical language further towards rock, funk and dance music, without The Lost Jockey's mistakes\\".Andy Blake: booklet notes of Jump Cut CD Style and work  Man Jumping was formed by Andy Blake (saxes, flute), Martin Ditcham (percussion, drums), Orlando Gough (keyboards), John Lunn (bass, keyboards), Glyn Perrin (keyboards, cello), Charlie Seaward (keyboards, flute) and Schaun Tozer (keyboards). Their music drew on world and ethnic musics, electronics and funk to create an alternative world dance music. Orlando Gough said in an interview, in March 1985: \\"I suppose there is some kind of nebulous central core of ideas, which may be to do with us all having come out of systems music and our interest in foreign music but actually we are influenced by Frank Zappa, James Blood Ulmer, Bach\\". A demo produced by Mike Hedges led to a contract with Bill Nelson's Cocteau Records, who released their first album Jump Cut in early 1985. Produced by Mike Hedges, Philip Bagenal and Man Jumping and recorded at Bagenal's own studio in Notting Hill, \\"Eastcote Productions\\", it attracted enthusiastic reviews. Time Out said: \\"Man Jumping merge the exacting algebra of systems music with the warmth, wit and passion of dance music and, in their own small way, are revolutionary, unique. I adore this album\\". The original album, with the additional 12\\"s and alternative mixes, was reissued in 1999 on the Shaping the Invisible label. Music critic Richard Williams (journalist), reviewing the album on its re- release suggested, \\"So maybe Man Jumping, a brilliant and volatile notion which gave rise to brilliant and volatile music was never destined for longevity. As a unit they lasted four years and two albums, but their legacy is demonstrably durable, a testament to their originality of thought and commitment to an idea of what music might be rather than an imitation of what it already was. Created from theory and technique, it nevertheless liberated itself from formal restrictions and took shape with a thrilling sense of its own possibilities. Carefully planned but made in the moment, we might say. And, as it turns out, built to last.\\" Jumpcut was selected as one of the records of the year by The Times, The Guardian and The Independent. A second album appeared on vinyl and on CD in 1987 entitled World Service. This was also recorded at Eastcote Studios and produced by Philip Bagenal and Man Jumping. Martin Ditcham had, by this time, left to tour with Sade and Simon Limbrick had joined. In his review for AllMusic, Dave Lynch noted that \\"On the Rocks is startling, sometimes ominous but ultimately both funky and ethereal\\"; \\"Next up is the cruising and raga-esque It's Been Fun a richly detailed, tabla fuelled immersive wonder\\". \\"The album wraps up with the irresistible high spirits and power of Orlando Gough's The Wedding, a groovefest extraordinaire suggesting the Steve Reich Ensemble showed up at a massive global party bursting from intricate propulsive constructions into gangbusters choruses that left the revellers fully spent\\". The state51 Conspiracy released both albums and the two 12\\" club mixes onto streaming sites starting on 15 November 2017. All tracks have been remastered and there are plans for remixes to be released in 2020. Jumpcut is now available on all streaming sites, having been remastered by Paul Golding. Man Jumping worked with and composed music for various dance companies and toured with London Contemporary Dance Theatre and Second Stride. Of the band's members, Schaun Tozer, John Lunn and Orlando Gough went on to have the most visible solo careers as composers - in music for both film and television, Glyn Perrin works as composer and performer, whilst Simon Limbrick and Martin Ditcham established careers as internationally renowned percussionists. Jumpcut was re-issued on vinyl by Emotional Rescue in January 2020. In 2019, Man Jumping curated a collection of remixes using the original analogue recordings converted to wav files, under the title \\"Man Jumping Remixed\\".

Overview After a series of trials throughout the North East Area, all of the remaining H1s were rebuilt as A8 4-6-2Ts between 1933 and 1936. During the process of rebuilding, the boiler was modified to include a Robinson-type superheater rather than the original Schmidt superheater. In 1935, further modifications resulted in the A8 boiler being interchangeable with the A6, A7, A8, H1, and T1 classes. Service The rebuilt A8s could easily work the heavy suburban traffic and long distance coastal trains on which they were put to work. They were also welcome replacements for the ageing G5 0-4-4Ts which had been working these services.

Murder of Nelson Rehmeyer  In 1928, under the malicious advice of a local woman named Nellie Noll (known as the River Witch of Marietta), John Blymire believed that he had been cursed by Nelson Rehmeyer. Blymire and his accomplices broke into Rehmeyer's home to find his copy of the braucherei 'spell book', the Long Lost Friend. Blymire and his fellow conspirators John Curry and Wilbert Hess (who likewise felt victimized by Rehmeyer) were unable to find the book, but did find Rehmeyer himself, whom they killed and mutilated in hopes that this would lift the curse. The three men charged with the crime also set fire to the house, hoping to remove remnants of the curse, as well as to destroy evidence of their murder. However, the house did not burn down as they had hoped. This led to many people further believing that Rehmeyer was a witch and that his power prevented the destruction of the house.

The small town of Odathali nestled in the Shivalik foothills was chosen not only for its extraordinary scenic beauty, but also for its proximity to the plains below. On a clear day one can get aerial view of Rishikesh, Haridwar and Ganga flowing from mountains to Plains of Haridwar. Odathali is a place of historic and mythological significance. It has been known to be a seat of spirituality and meditation since ancient times. According to legend, the sage Uddhava is known to have performed severe penance at this spot. Also, Purasara, the founder of astrology, has been known to conduct various experiments on the movements of planets and stars. His observatory has now been converted into the local polytechnic. Maharaja Narendra Shah was an enlightened ruler, as you can see in the well-ordered civic buildings of the neat little royal township of Narendranagar.

The Palace 'Annexe' was added to the original palace building in 1910 to house the Viceroy and his entourage who visited Narendra Nagar fairly often. Over the years, the regal corridors of the Palace has echoed with the footsteps of many distinguished guests - former Prime Ministers of India, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi and spiritual leaders like Anandmayi Ma and Swami Sivanand as well as the last British Viceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten of Burma. The last Maharaja, Manabendra Shah took over the reins of Tehri Garhwal in 1946, from Maharaja Narendra Shah, who abdicated in the favour of his son.History Rudraprayag Official district website.

It is now a town in Gadag district in the Indian state of Karnataka. Geography Nargund is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Nargund It has an average elevation of 605 metres (1984 feet). The name \\"Nargund\\" comes from \\"Nari Gundu\\", which means \\"Hillock of Foxes\\" in Kannada. The town is marked by such a hillock right in the centre of town. Although known to be a place full of foxes in the past, it has none now and is pocked with windmills on all sides. Nargund Fort Nargund Fort is located on a hill in the center of town. It was created by the famous Maratha King Chhatrapati Shivaji in 1675. It has been witness to many a battle. It was different from other forts created by Shivaji. It had amazing architecture. The fort was planned to be challenging for any enemy to capture it. It was established in order to delay annexation by the Mughals of the territory, acting as a stronghold over the area. Most of the area inside Nargund Fort was used by Shivaji's army. Unlike other forts in Karnataka, Nargund Fort had no fortresses or multiple floors (storeys). There was no garden or sanctuary inside. Shivaji did not believe such structures to be essential to the fort and, therefore, did not waste the time or resources on constructing them. Aside from a few ornamental components, the architecture of Nargund Fort was based on bare essentials such as a reservoir, an ammunition storage space, a large well for uninterrupted water supply and watch towers. As of now, the great Nargund Fort has become a ruin. Most of the structures inside the fort have been destroyed over time. The place has become an open field; anyone can enter it unhindered. It is under the custody of the Government of Karnataka. Entry is unrestricted and very little has been done in order to renovate it. Gradually, the once great fort is in the process of becoming just a memory. It was under Maratha rulers for 15 years after its creation. Later, Mughal emperor Aurangzeb invaded the fort and captured it, by defeating the Maratha army. However, the courageous Marathas again captured the fort from Mughal rulers under Ramrao Dadaji Bhave in 1707. In the 18th century Nargund Fort along with the surrounding region was under the authority of King Venkat Rao of the Bhave family, which was subservient to the Marathas. The suzerainty of the Maratha rulers over Nargund Fort remained till 1778, when it was captured by the King of Mysore, Hyder Ali. In 1784, Hyder Ali's son, Tipu Sultan, controlled the fort. Nargund Fort played a vital part during the revolt against the British - the Sepoy Mutiny - of 1857. Who has not heard the name of ‚ÄòBABASAHIB‚Äô of Nargund? It was he who raised a mutiny against British rule in India in 1858 and gave a clarion call of freedom to Indians. Known for his courage, valor and love of freedom, Babasahib of Nargund stood like a rock and fought like a lion against British authority. By killing Manson, the Political Agent of South India, he sent shivers up the spines of the British. But it was unfortunate that his own people stabbed him at the back and saw to his defeat and downfall. At the time, the fort was occupied by Bhaskar Rao Bhave, who administered the Nargund area. He defeated the British army, which attacked the fort in order to seize it. Later, under the leadership of Major Malcolm, Nargund Fort was captured by the British army. Although Nargund Fort has become a ruin, it has historical importance which makes it a place ideal for tourism. Tourists can see the remains of the historical fort. Also, one can enjoy the sight of the open fields beside it and the hillside. Demographics India census, Nargund had a population of 32,548. Males constitute 51% of the population and females 49%. Nargund has an average literacy rate of 56%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 67%, and female literacy is 45%. In Nargund, 14% of the population is under 6 years of age.

Early life John Anthony Kaiser was born in Perham, Minnesota, USA. John attended Saint John's Preparatory School and St. John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota, for two years before he joined the army in 1954. He was a paratrooper, and advanced to the rank of Sergeant. He graduated from Saint Louis University in 1960, with a BA in English Literature.Some sources say theology. While in St. Louis, he joined the Knights of Columbus. From here, he went to St. Joseph Seminary in Mill Hill, England, where he studied from 1960 to 1964. Kaiser was ordained in St. Louis for the Mill Hill Fathers in 1964, and was sent to their missions in Kenya. Maela refugee camp Kaiser spent 20 years in the missions in the Kisii Diocese. Over that time the Catholic population had doubled, so that 48 priests were ministering to more than half a million Catholics in the diocese, many living in grinding poverty. In 1993, he was reassigned to the Maela refugee camp in the Ngong Diocese. Refugees fled to the camp as a result of tribal violence, armed gangs driving them from their homes and then torching the buildings. Kaiser and others thought the government was fomenting the violence as part of a land grab. Amid international attention, on Christmas Eve, 1994, the camp was closed and the refugees were forcibly resettled. Kaiser protested the closing, but he was arrested, beaten, and released into the bush. Following these events, Kaiser was reassigned to preach to the more distant Maasai at Lolgorian Parish. In 1998, at great personal risk, Kaiser testified before the Akiwumi Commission, investigating the causes of the violence and the closing of the camp. In public, sworn testimony, Kaiser fingered prominent cabinet ministers in the incumbent government, as well as the then-President, Daniel arap Moi. His testimony was quashed. The report of the commission was released on October 18, 2002. It confirmed the charges made by Fr. Kaiser, \\"indicted ... senior officials\\", and \\"accused senior officials of giving inflammatory speeches and in some cases financing persons responsible for the violence.\\" Kaiser had also helped two schoolgirls in summer 1999. The girls claimed they had been raped by Julius Sunkuli, a cabinet minister in the Moi government. Sunkuli is alleged to have offered money for an abortion, but the girl, a fourteen-year- old named Florence, decided to keep her baby. Kaiser put the girls in touch with the Kenyan Federation of Women Lawyers, FIDA-Kenya. The attorneys submitted the evidence to the government, but Sunkuli was never charged. Instead, police stormed the building where the girls were hiding. Troubles with the Kenyan government In November, 1999, the Kenyan government tried to deport Kaiser, claiming that his work permit had expired. Kaiser briefly went into hiding in Kisii before he was granted a new work permit, but only after intervention by the US Ambassador Johnnie Carson and Bishop Colin Davis of Ngong. In March, 2000, the independent Law Society of Kenya presented Kaiser with its annual Human Rights Award, for his public testimony before the Akiwumi Commission and his support of the two girls. They called him \\"a study in courage, determination and sacrifice on behalf of the weak, oppressed and downtrodden.\\" Kaiser knew of the dangers of speaking out in Kenya, and of a fate which had befallen many others. In a book about his experiences at the Maela camp, he wrote a warning. Death and aftermath On August 23, 2000, Kaiser was shot in the back of the head with a shotgun, at close range. His body was found at 6 am the next day beneath two acacia trees by a butcher named George, at Morendat junction on the Nakuru-Naivasha road in western Kenya. He was carrying documents he intended to present to the Akiwumi Commission. He was also to testify against the Moi government before the International Criminal Court in the Hague in three weeks. The first police officers on the scene thought he had been murdered. Less than a week after Kaiser's death, Florence Mpayei dropped her rape case against Julius Sunkuli. Kenya's chief government pathologist and a pathologist from an independent human rights organization present at the autopsy thought Kaiser was killed from a muzzle distance of about , from which suicide would be impossible. However, an FBI expert from Texas, who did not examine Kaiser but only saw photographs, concluded that Kaiser had committed suicide. The Moi government readily agreed. Both houses of the United States Congress passed a joint resolution calling Kaiser's death \\"an assassination\\", and calling for the US State Department to investigate. Memorial at his home parish, St. James in Maine Township, Otter Tail County, Minnesota The papal nuncio, Giovanni Tonucci, said at Kaiser's funeral in the Nairobi basilica, \\"The church, through pitiless violence, has once more been deprived of one of her ministers. Let no one have any doubts about it: we are celebrating a religious occasion; we are reflecting on a religious assassination, not a political one. Fr. Kaiser has been murdered because he was, and in the eternity of God still is, a Catholic priest who preached the Gospel. Those who killed him, those who planned his killing, wanted to silence the voice of the Gospel.\\"...\\"Only two days before his death, I met Fr. Kaiser for a long conversation. At the end, he asked my blessing, which I reluctantly gave him. At that moment, I thought it would have been better if he, an old and worthy missionary, had blessed me. How much more I am convinced of that now that we look at him as a martyr of the faith?\\" Also present at the altar was Maurice Cardinal Otunga, Archbishop Emeritus of Nairobi. The Law Society of Kenya renamed its annual award the Fr. Kaiser Human Rights Award. A new Kenyan government was elected in 2002. Since then, the Kenyan National Human Rights Commission posthumously honored Kaiser with its 2006 Milele (Lifetime) Achievement Award. Kaiser also posthumously received the Twin Cities International Citizen Award from the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul in 2000, and the Lumen Gentium Award from St. John's Preparatory School in 2004. Correspondent Carol Marin and producer Peter W. Klein of the American news program 60 Minutes conducted an investigation into the death of Kaiser, which put pressure on the international community to solve the mystery of how he died. The Kenyan government reopened the inquest into Kaiser's death at the request of the Kenyan Episcopal Conference. The inquest ended on June 12, 2007, after hearing from 111 witnesses. The presiding magistrate, Maureen Odero, said on August 1, 2007, that Kaiser was murdered, ruled that the \\"Suicide Theory\\" was based on a preconceived notion, but stated that \\"she could not ‚Äì on the basis of evidence tabled before her in the inquest ‚Äì point out with certainty who the priest's killers were\\".

Brief character overview Mary Russell: She is nineteen, and currently on a break from studying theology at Oxford University. During the escapade, she is dressed as a young Bedouin man and must learn the Arabic language on the go. She keeps throwing knives in her boots and has excellent aim. Sherlock Holmes: The aging detective has recently had his back badly hurt in The Beekeeper's Apprentice. He visited Palestine previously, and so already has experience with the customs and language, to a certain degree. Mahmoud Hazr: He works as a traveling scribe, which covers up that he and Ali are British spies. He has a scar on his face from being previously tortured. He is taciturn and is described as being as steady as a rock. Ali Hazr-: He is Mahmoud's younger brother, and dresses very flamboyantly. He uses a large unwieldy knife for everything, including carving small wooden figures. He has excellent night vision, and is said to have, ‚ÄúEyes like a cat.‚Äù He is highly distrustful of Holmes and Russell when they first come. Joshua: He is a spymaster, whom the Hazrs report to. He collects reports from a small shack outside of Beersheva. He was in France fighting in the trenches for six months during World War I and works for the British Empire.  External links  * Laurie R.
