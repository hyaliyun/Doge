It is also known as Inglefield House. It was built by William Carss. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Surgeon William Balmain was granted 550 acres and most of the area now encompassing Balmain in 1800. In 1801 the entire grant was transferred to fellow surgeon John Gilchrist. Gilchrist never actually lived in NSW and advertised the land for sale in 1823. However, the sale was not a success. He gave power of attorney to his Sydney-based agent and merchant, Frank Parbury, who commissioned Surveyor John Armstrong to subdivide part of the land. In 1836 22, 2-4 acres lots mostly about Balmain East were auctioned for sale by Parbury on behalf of the absentee landowner, Gilchrist. Parbury himself leased/bought 10 acres at the south eastern part of the Waterview Bay and built the first house on the Balmain grant, Waterview House in 1835 (demolished c. 1905). It was later purchased by George Cooper, Comptroller of Customs, who owned/ leased 28 acres adjacent to the west. Cooper subsequently fell victim to the crash of the early 1840s and was declared bankrupt. He had taken out a mortgage to Matthew Henry Marsh, a barrister, pastoralist and parliamentarian just prior and his inability to pay brought about the loss of the Waterview Estate to Marsh. The land was subdivided by A. W. Miekle in 1841 and site became part Marsh's 1843 sale. Melbourne investors and merchants, Joseph Herring and Lesley Alexander Moody bought lots 30 to 34 in Waterview Street from Marsh in March 1843. Lots 30 to 32 were subsequently purchased by William Carss in October 1849 for 80 pounds. It would appear that the improved economic conditions allowed Carrs to construct a house on the land some time between 1849 and 1855 when the land was sold to Zachary Ingold for 1200 pounds. The increase in cost would indicate significant improvements to the land and conveyance included a dwelling called \\"Inglefield House\\". Ingold sold to James Yeend, a Sydney innkeeper and prominent Balmain citizen and Municipality of Balmain alderman in 1857. During the early 1860s Yeend sold a 20 feet strip of this land to allow for the construction of Wells Street. His wife continued to reside in the house following his death in 1864. Yeend Street, Yeend Wharf and Yeend Terrace are named after him. Yeend retained the name of the house and his widow stayed on until 1880 when the three lots were sold to William Harris Ariell for 400 pounds. Ariell renamed the house ‚ÄúLouisaville‚Äù after his wife. Ariell died in 1882, but the house was enlarged between 1887 and 1896. A mock- Gothic entrance porch, western additions and detached weatherboard structure were added during this time. A Sydney Water plan (Balmain Sheet No. 16) prepared in the late 1880s and revised in the early 1890s shows the house occupying a large roughly square shaped block bounded by Waterview and Wells Streets. It would appear that part of the northern corner may have been subdivided a structure constructed in the periods between the late 1880s and 1890s. The house is setback from the street frontages and located in north western corner of the site. Sited on an angle a front verandah is clear facing the Wells Street frontage. Several wings are shown attached to the northern end of the building. A long detached structure is also shown constructed to the south western site boundary. Part of the attached and northern detached structure and small addition to the south eastern fa√ßade of the building are shaded on the plan, indicating that they were added in the period between the late 1880s and 1890s. Louisa Ariell lived in the house until her death in 1931 when her daughter, Louisa, inherited the property. In 1940 she sold the property to Charlotte and William Holloway. Since that time it would appear that the site was subdivided into three parcels with separate portions formed at the corner of Wells and Waterview Streets and along the Wells Street frontage. Some alterations and additions have also been undertaken to the building and new fence and landscaping undertaken to Wells Street. The state government made an Interim Conservation Order over Louisaville on 21 November 1980 following the sale of the property, and upgraded it to a Permanent Conservation Order on 4 August 1984. It was threatened with demolition in the early 1980s, but survived after an alternate proposal led to the subdivision of Louisaville's surrounding land for the construction of townhouses. The house was then restored and extended under new owners. Description Louisaville is a one-storey dwelling with an attic face stone and rendered walls with hipped gable and skillion roofs clad in corrugated steel and stone and rendered chimneys. A gable roofed dormer with corrugated steel and slate cladding and timber framed double hung window is also located on the northern roof slope. An open verandah extends across the front of the building. The verandah is elevated above ground level with stone steps and floor on a stone base. Timber posts support the hipped verandah roof which is also clad in corrugated steel. The verandah also has a timber balustrade and timber boarding partially encloses the eastern end. The front fa√ßade also has pairs of timber and glass French doors with timber shutters and twelve paned timber framed double hung windows with stone sills. Timber framed windows are also located at the gable end. A single storey skillion roofed wing extends from the western side and rear of the house. The western wing faces a paved courtyard. The rear fa√ßade features two tall, stone chimneys and faces an open grassed yard. A long, two storey rendered outbuilding also with half hipped roof clad in corrugated steel, timber framed windows and door and small verandah at the western end is constructed to the rear boundary. A narrow drive extends from the southern corner of the site to Waterview Street. Another small rendered outbuilding is located adjacent to the paved patio area. The house is set well back from the Wells Street frontage which has heavy timber post and picket fence and gate on a rock and stone base with terraced garden between featuring several mature trees including a large magnolia grandiflora and Sydney Cove Fig. Stone steps extend up the gate and a concrete path extends through the garden to the building entry. Various alterations and early additions are evident in the building fabric, stone and rendered facades. A skylight has been added to the front roof slope with modern services also added to the rear. The large outbuilding to the rear has also been modified with garage door opening on the eastern side. Concrete and brick paving and patio are relatively recent additions. Significance No. 2 Wells Street is of historic and aesthetic significance as a good and intact representative example of a stone and rendered Victorian Regency dwelling constructed sometime between 1849 and 1855. Despite subdivision of the site and some alterations the building retains its original and early form and fabric including face stone and rendered facades and chimneys, open verandah and associated details, roof form and pattern of openings. The building is enhanced by its garden setting and mature trees which make a positive contribution to the local area.

His last words before his execution; ‚ÄúMay dictatorship be wrecked. May democracy be flourish.‚Äù (), have been repeatedly quoted in various protests and demonstrations for Thailand‚Äôs struggling democracy. Early life Born to a well-off farming family in Sakon Nakhon Province, Chandawong began his career as a teacher in his home region. During World War II, he joined the Free Thai Movement (Seri Thai), an underground anti-Japanese resistance movement. Political activities In the post-war era, Chandawong's activities attracted the ire of several Thai governments. He was a close friend of Tiang Sirikhanth,Fry, Gerald W., Nieminen, Gayla S., Smith, Harold E. \\"Historical Dictionary of Thailand\\" pg. 216 who, like Chandawong, was a schoolteacher from Sakon Nakhon and former member of Seri Thai, and who was killed in 1952 on orders of the Phibun government. Chandawong founded Sammakkhittham ('Solidarity'), a peasant-based group which allegedly attracted thousands of members in northeastern Thailand and was seen as a threat by the central government. Chandawong was jailed for five years from 1952 to 1957 on charges of rebellion, before being released as part of a mass amnesty. After his release, Chandawong became a member of parliament for Sakon Nakhon from 1957-1958. He advocated repeal of anti-communist laws, direct election of village headmen, and Isan separatism. On 6 May 1961, Chandawong and several dozen others were arrested for alleged communist activities. He was accused of anti-Buddhist and anti-monarchical activities. According to the statement announcing his execution, he had stated that, after a communist revolution in Thailand, the king and monks would be sent to labor in factories. Execution and aftermath On 30 May 1961, Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat met with his cabinet and decreed that Chandawong and Thongpan Sutthimat were to be executed \\"to protect national security and the Throne\\". The pair were summarily executed the next day. After the execution, Chandawong's wife and daughter, along with other activists, fled into the mountains of northeastern Thailand; they made contacts with the Pathet Lao and would form the core of the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT). His daughter, under the alias Rassamee, became something of a cult figure in the CPT, while two of his sons became provincial-level figures within the movement. A small monument was erected to Chandawong and Thongpan in 2003, but was later moved inside a government compound and then had a road built within a meter of the new location.

It was built from 1880 to 1941. It is also known as Adelaide Steamship Company wharf and Burns timber yard. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Waterview Wharf Workships are purpose-built maritime industrial buildings on the foreshore of Waterview Bay, Balmain. They form part of the few surviving maritime structures which once stretched along the southern shore of the harbour from Balmain to Garden Island and includes the wharves of Pyrmont, Walsh Bay, Circular Quay and Woolloomooloo.Godden, 1988 The key periods of significance of the property relate to the late 19th century and early 20th century use of the site.LouiseThom, 2016 There are three distinct historical phases of development on the site. The first relates to the Burns timber yard from 1880 to 1898. The second (1900-1939) to the outbreak of World War II was the Adelaide Steamship Company. The third is the Adelaide Steamship Company during the World War II war years and its subsequent decline until the 1960s.LouiseThom, 2016, 6 This workshops site, through erection of the stone sea wall and excavation of the former cliff to provide fill on which the Burns Mill was built, illustrates the importance of the waterfront industrial land in Balmain in the late 19th century.Godden, 1988, p 6, 8 The workshops are the last significant remnant of the early 20th century maritime industry which was concentrated in Waterview Bay and included Mort's Dock, West's Sail Loft, the UTA Ferry Workshops and Sydney Slipways. They represent the importance of maritime trade to the development of Sydney in the early 20th century. They are one of the most tangible remnants of the Adelaide Steamship Company which for decades was the largest shipping company in Australia. The siting of the company's workshops in Waterview (Mort) Bay was a major event in the maritime history of Sydney. The workshops are directly associated with Thomas Elder and Robert Barr Smith who were two of Australia's most prominent 19th century entrepreneurs. The Waterview Wharf Workshops were one of the principal employers of labour in Balmain in the early 20th century. Like Mort's Dock, the Adelaide Steamship Company used casual labour rather than permanent labour and was responsible, in part, for the entrenching of union values in the suburb (of Balmain). The Waterview Wharf Workshops had the reputation for being the finest-equipped repair facilities of medium size in Sydney. Building 2 is from the 1st phase of the Adelaide Steamship Company development on the site between 1900 and 1939. It was built in the final phase of the company('s occupation). It originally had a corrugated iron roof that was replaced with a corrugated asbestos roof 1940. Building 1 was originally constructed 1940, likely of asbestos roofing and walls. This building is indicative of the historical decline in the shipbuilding industry and of Adelaide Steamship Company after the (Second World) war as it provides evidence of the last development phase on the site. It had ancillary functions and did not play an important role in the industrial use of the site.LouiseThom , 2016, 6 The substantial site works and construction of new buildings on the site in the 1940s coincided with the increasingly widespread use of asbestos as a building material at this time.LouiseThom , 2016, 6  Description  Machine at Adelaide Steamship Company, Balmain, 1947 =Complex= The Waterview Wharf Workshops are an attractive, well-proportioned group of purpose-built maritime industrial buildings on the foreshore of Waterview Bay, Balmain. They form part of the few surviving maritime structures which once stretched along the southern shore of the harbour from Balmain to Garden Island and includes the wharves of Pyrmont, Walsh Bay, Circular Quay and Woolloomooloo. The Waterview Wharf Workshops site, through erection of the stone sea wall and excavation of the former cliff to provide fill on which the Burns Mill was built, illustrates the importance of the waterfront industrial land in Balmain in the late 19th century. The Waterview Wharf Workshops are the last significant remnant of the early 20th century maritime industry which was concentrated in Waterview Bay and included Mort's Dock, West's Sail Loft, the UTA Ferry Workshops and Sydney Slipways. The workshops possess sufficient fabric for the site to be adequately interpreted in industrial archaeological terms. The workshops are one of the few remaining industrial sites which exhibit, through the wharf access road and the air raid shelter, the effect of the Second World War on the fabric of domestic industrial sites. =Building 2 ( 1900)= Located at the top of the site adjacent to the Zig Zag Reserve. This westernmost building was built at the same time as the lower, c.1900 buildings and is very similar in design and construction, albeit of a much-smaller scale. It has a timber frame with walls clad in corrugated iron, a corrugated asbestos cement roof with skylights and timber floors. It is two storeys, with the same type of windows as found elsewhere on site. Provides physical evidence of an important historical phase on the site, that of the shipbuilding years of the Adelaide Steamship Company. It relates to the other Edwardian era buildings on the lower part of the site. Its existing corrugated asbestos roof sheeting replaced an original corrugated iron roof c.1940.

Built variously of brick fibro and corrugated iron, it is (one of a number of) general-purpose personnel- centred buildings built, indicative of the historical decline in the shipbuilding industry and of Adelaide Steamship Company after the (Second World) war as it provides evidence of the last development phase on the site. It is likely the existing asbestos roof and walls are original fabric. It had ancillary functions and did not play an important role in the industrial use of the site.

He also wrote that when there is a flaw in governmental affairs, it is religious scholars' duty to refer to it, regardless of whether the king favors this approach, or tries to correct it or not. He asked the king in strong terms to cancel the contract and dismiss the prime minister, who was behind the signing of the contract.

It was designed by the Commonwealth Department of the Interior and constructed in 1936. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011.  History  Bowen, near Port Denison in North Queensland, is halfway between Townsville and Mackay, approximately 1,130 kilometres by road from Brisbane. It is the region's oldest town, founded on the same day that the American Civil War began on 12 April 1861. George Dalrymple named the town after Sir George Bowen, the first Governor of Queensland. Port Denison was declared an official port of entry in the same year, and not long afterwards, the construction of a large timber jetty commenced in 1865. In 1869, the telegraph line from Bowen to Townsville was opened and following improvements to the port, including the completion of the jetty and the dredging of the harbour, shipping and handling of local produce, cargo, mail and passengers secured the primacy of the town in the region. By 1910, a tramway connected Proserpine with Bowen, permitting sugar from the Proserpine Sugar Mill to be shipped from Port Denison. The opening of the Bowen-Townsville railway line followed in 1913. Former Bowen Post Office, 1908 The town's main thoroughfare is Herbert Street, which leads down to the port. It is a wide avenue with a central landscaped median strip and a prominent war memorial terminating the east axis. Bowen Post Office, constructed in 1936, is located on the southeast intersection with Powell Street. It replaced an earlier post office on Dalrymple Street. Several other municipal buildings nearby include the Bowen Shire Chambers (c.1920s), the memorial club directly opposite, and the Bowen courthouse, police and ambulance station. Since completion, a service wing has been added to the rear of the post office fronting Powell Street; a double storey redbrick exchange building is constructed on the north site boundary. To the east, with a shared right-of-way, a two-storey Telstra building has been built with a large steel- framed telecommunications tower in the rear yard. The building was designed by the Commonwealth Department of Interior under the control of architect Horace Mackennal.  Description  Bowen Post Office, circa 1890 Bowen Post Office is at 46 Herbert Street, corner Powell Street, Bowen, comprising the whole of Lot 3 RP742488. Bowen Post Office is located at the corner of Herbert and Powell Streets at the top of the main thoroughfare through town, which falls gradually down to the port. Nearby civic buildings include the courthouse and police station, and the council chambers directly opposite. Herbert Street is a wide boulevard with a landscaped median strip containing the Bowen War Memorial. The corner site is rectangular and is flanked by a two-storey red brickwork exchange on the north side fronting Powell Street. A concrete side driveway on the east side of the post office provides service delivery access and carparking to the rear of the site. Directly north of this is a two-storey Telstra building which has a large telecommunications tower at the rear. Built in 1936, Bowen Post Office presents a smooth rendered frontage to Herbert Street, which broadly follows the symmetrical fronted twin-entry post offices common in Queensland after the 1910s but translated in a cubic parapeted form. The frontage comprises two corner entry porches with parapets on both sides, and a central breakfront between them. Formerly this contained the telephone booths and public counter area and was lit by large a triple window below a higher parapet. The Art Deco styling is concentrated across the Herbert Street elevation, which is decorated with a stringcourse running across the central breakfront and a stepped-back moulding just below the parapet ridges. In the central bay, the linking course line jumps up over the ripple window and encloses it. Sculpted ornamentation of the flat fronted walls comes from a number of elements: two bosses; another course just below the parapet; stepping in the parapet itself; and a semicircular moulding, like the central acroterion finial on early Greek temples. The corner porches also include columns with stylised capitals and keystones over the openings and a moulded cornice which is highlighted by a cross and dart motif. The rear and side elevations of the building present as smooth stucco walls with moulded cornices and windows with raised cement surrounds and projecting sills. They are breakfronted with hipped roofs and gap-planked boxed eaves and recall the Georgian Revival design of Ayr Post Office completed in the same year and in the same general region. Herbert Street frontage, 1939In plan form, the central retail shop is entered from either corner side porch. The west porch also accesses the post office box lobby, which has subsequently been installed within the west end of the former mailroom, involving the enlargement of an original window (in the north wall) to form a door opening. The interior has three main sections which relate to the following grouping of functions: the retail shop counter, mail sorting room and post office box lobby; staff amenities, contractors' rooms and storage areas (northeast corner); and service delivery and loading bay (addition to the northwest corner). The basement level extends under the rear northeast corner and is used for storage purposes. The building is a single storey with a basement level at the rear (north) and comprises: * Structural frame: Loadbearing masonry construction with timber floor and roof framing. Brick piers and walls at basement level generally support the ground floor with the northeast section of the building (formerly associated with the telegraph facility) using reinforced concrete slab and beam construction. * External walls: Stucco rendered brickwork decorated with a moulded string line and cornice encircling the building. Window openings have raised cement surrounds and projecting sills. The corner portico columns have stylised capitals and keystones, and a moulded cornice. The sub floor metal grates have a diamond pattern and perimeter windows generally have double hung sashes which are subdivided by glazing bars into chequerboard and diamond patterns. * Internal walls: Generally hard rendered walls with V-dado marking, timber curtain rails and plaster cornices. Door openings have moulded architraves. * Floor: Generally, timber boards (subsequently covered with carpet and vinyl) with moulded timber skirting. The northeast section of concrete floor is covered with vinyl tiles. * Ceiling: Fibrous plaster ceilings with gridded vents and moulded cornices (generally replaced or concealed with new plasterboard sheet). The corner porch ceilings are strapped plaster with moulded cornices. * Roof: Timber-framed hipped roof lined with terracotta roof tiles. Eaves are timber-slatted. Rainwater goods comprise square box gutters with decorative rainwater heads and connection plates. * Front building inscription \\"BOWEN POST OFFICE\\" surmounted by central pediment and flagpole. * Decorative moulds either side of opening over original counter. = Condition = The original planning of Bowen Post Office comprised a symmetrically composed twin porch with a central breakfronted and pedimented postal hall. The planning arrangement provided dual but independent operation of the postal and telegraphic functions around the central postal hall. The front public area contained four corner telephone booths and a counter, with a large mailroom beyond defined (externally) by the main transverse roof ridge. The rear northwest corner accommodated the telegraph functions with an off-form concrete floor slab over the basement area. Generally, the majority of original internal walls remain, although the installation full and ¬æ height walls have subdivided most of the principal rooms into smaller areas. This includes the former mailroom which has three main sections: post office box lobby (west), retail shop and counter (centre) and interview rooms (east). A new mailroom and loading bay area has been added to the building (northwest corner), aligned to the original rear verandah which retains its original raked ceiling. The rooms associated with the original telegraph facility (northeast corner) have also been subdivided, although the timber framed and glazed partitions remain intact. Notwithstanding the changed pattern of circulation and use, the external presentation of the building is able to demonstrate key aspects of the original design, particularly the parapeted frontage, hipped roof form, smooth rendered wall finishes and stylised mouldings. The main alteration is associated with addition of the mailroom and loading dock which fronts Powell Street and has involved the extension of the original roof line and is indistinguishable as new work. Elsewhere, changes include the addition of the disabled ramp to east porch and steel-framed awnings over the walkways at the rear of the building. Internally, much of the original fabric and detailing are intact, although largely concealed by new finishes. Despite changes to its pattern of circulation and use, and while altered, Bowen Post Office maintains a reasonable ability to demonstrate its original design and manner of construction, and this is most evident externally with the building's street frontages. Externally and internally the building is in relatively sound condition.  Heritage listing  Bowen Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Bowen Post Office, constructed in 1936, is one of many small single-storey post offices designed built throughout Queensland in the interwar period to service its towns and regional centres. The building has clear associations with the regional development of southern Mackay. These aspects of the building's history are of local significance. The significant components of Bowen Post Office include the main postal building constructed in 1936. Criterion B: Rarity While the application of Art Deco detail to the Bowen Post office is concentrated along the Herbert Street parapeted frontage, is restrained to three-dimensional massing and symmetry with stylised low-relief decoration, and is conservative in design terms, the application is comparatively rare in terms of the post offices surveyed. The stylistic treatment includes the moulded columns, capitals, keystones and string lines in low relief on smooth rendered walls. Criterion D: Characteristic values Bowen Post Office is an example of: * a retail post office typology (third generation 1930-1974) * an Interwar architecture c. 1915-1942 (Neo-Georgian Revival with Art Deco flourish) * a work of the Commonwealth Department of the Interior under Horace Mackennal Typologically, Bowen Post Office, built in 1936, is an example of a third generation retail post office. This generation demonstrate an emergent retail function in postal operations, separation of the telephone exchange area and increased requirements for larger post office box lobby areas with independent access and serviced by a frontally positioned mail sorting room and/or a rear loading yard. These aspects are evident in the original design to the extent that symmetrical porch entries were placed either side of a central postal hall, allowing the telegraph and postal services to operate independently. Subsequently, the internal subdivision of the mailroom has facilitated the enlargement of the retail function and installation of the post office box lobby, and a new mailroom added to the northwest corner of the building. The former telegraph and telephone facilities have been removed and the areas refurbished for other uses. In the state context, and with regard to post offices still owned and operated by Australia Post, Bowen Post Office is one of three \\"Type M6 1930s Twin Porch\\" built in the period 1935-38 with similar planning arrangements and municipal siting, the others being Ayr Post Office (1936) and Ingham Post Office (1935). The type is defined as following the basic layout and form of 1920s and 1940-50s post offices, are domestic in scale, and are physically associated with townscape civic gestures or elements such as war memorials. Architecturally, the basic configuration comprises a symmetrical expanded porch in the manner of many 1920s and 1930s Queensland post offices, but translated here as cuboid pavilions. The primary distinguishing feature of Bowen Post Office is its Art Deco styling, which is concentrated along the Herbert Street parapeted frontage, and is albeit restrained and conservative. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Bowen Post Office is a domestically-scaled building which a degree of municipal and landmark qualities. This is principally due to its parapeted building frontage to Herbert Street and its physical proximity to other civic buildings including the Shire Council Chambers, police station, ambulance station and courthouse, as well as their collective frontages to Herbert Street, the town's main street. Criterion G: Social value Built in 1936, and replacing the original post office on another site, Bowen Post Office is of social value due to the continuity of postal services which have operated from the place for over seventy years.

It is protected by the central government as a National Historic Site. The site consists of the ruins of two castles, Torigoe Castle and Futoge Castle. The two castles were built on two mountaintops with the Dainichi River between them in 1573 as the final bastions for the Kaga Ikk≈ç-Ikki movement. Background Following the Onin War, the weakened Muromachi shogunate was unable to exert control over the Hokuriku region, much of which came undertake control of the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´-led Ikk≈ç-ikki movement led by the priest Rennyo, who abolished the local feudal rulers and social structure to create a \\"peasant's republic\\". Kaga Province fell to the movement in 1488. However, the movement was strongly opposed by Oda Nobunaga, who invaded Kaga after successfully seizing neighbouring Echizen Province in 1573. The Ikk≈ç-ikki leadership at Hongan-ji responded by sending a commander named Suzuki Dewa-no-kami (about whom little is known) to organise the resistance to Nobunaga in around 1580. He chose a remote valley whose entrance was protected by Funaoka Castle as his stronghold. This valley already had a small castle called ; however, Suzuki chose to build a second, and larger castle immediately across the Dainichi River, and named it Torigoe Castle. Structure Torigoe Castle is located on a 312-meter high, long and narrow ridge between themain stream of the Tedori River its tributary Dainichi River. The inner bailey is located on the highest part of the ridge, and is a rectangular area with dimensions of 50 x 20 meters with a fortified two-story gate and yagura turrets. Parts of the remparts are reinforced with stone. To the south of the inner bailey is a secondary kuruwa enclosure. There is also a third kuruwa behind the main bailey, and all of these enclosures were protected by dry moats. The total size of the castle was approximately 300 x 50 meters. Neighbouring Futoge Castle was much smaller, but was likewise built on a ridge with several small enclosures. History Oda forces captured ≈åyama-g≈çb≈ç, the headquarters of the Kaga Ikk≈ç-ikki in 1580, and the Oda army lead by Sakuma Morimasa moved swiftly to crush remaining resistance at Torigoe Castle. However, Suzuki used his a force of matchlock gunners with great effect, and the Oda army was under to take Torigoe on its first attempt. Meanwhile, word reached the defenders that the head of the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ movement had reached an accommodation with Nobunaga at Ishiyama Hongan-ji. This meant that they were now isolated, and thus when the Oda general Shibata Katsuie invited a parley, Suzuki Dewa-No-Mami accepted his offer and went to his castle for negotiations. The parley was a ruse, and Suzuki and his generals were murdered. Now leaderless, Torigoe Castle quickly fell to the Oda. The following year, Sakuma moved his army to Kanazawa, and the local people of the Hakusan area seized the opportunity to retake Torigoe and Futoge Castles, killing the local commanders. Sakuma responded by recovering the castles and slaughtering all 300 of the defenders. Torigoe Castle was abandoned some time after Sakuma was executed after the 1583 Battle of Shizugatake. Kaga Province came under the rule of the Maeda clan. Maeda Toshiie was still wary of a revival of the Kaga Ikk≈ç-ikki movement and refortified nearby Funaoka Castle; however, Torigoe and Futoge castles were abolished and the sites were lost. Archaeological investigations have revealed the outlines of the fortifications and foundations of the structures, some of which have been restored as a tourist attraction. The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017.

It also references the history of homosexual sex on the island during its history as Ceylon and as part of various continental kingdoms during pre-colonial times.  Human rights and legalities  = Penal Code = The sections 365 and 365A proscribe that any unnatural offences or acts of gross indecency between persons should be punished with \\"rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 10 years and not exceeding twenty years with a fine and compensation\\". = Vagrants Ordinance = The section 07 of 1841 criminalizes soliciting and acts of indecency in public places, with a punishment of no more than six months and a fine of 100 rupees.  History  Homosexuality has been in literature and artwork for several thousands of years. It is thought that homosexual sex was not looked down upon until the 16th century with the arrival of missionaries from Europe who promoted their religious values that forbade homosexual sex and eventually imposed laws criminalizing homosexual sex under colonialism. Efforts during the post-colonial era to support sexual minorities increased in the 21st century. = Lanka = The concept of homosexuality was widely known in the prevailing Hindu culture by the time the Buddha founded his philosophies. The monastic discipline explicitly contained homosexual sex alongside a variety of prohibitions against heterosexual sex, and it also explicitly stated that these rules were to only be applied to monks and not the lay people. It is notable that masturbation is not considered a serious offense by the order. Homosexuality was also not criminalized nor marginalized during the pre- colonial times of the island. The traditional legal codes of Lanka did not criminalize sexual minorities or actively discriminate against homosexuals. In the 5th century of the Christian calendar, the monk Buddhaghosa attempted to explain what pandakas was in his scriptures to Buddhist lay people. Other records simply stay silent on the subject; for example, the UpƒÅsakajanalankara, a guide for lay people written in the 14th century of the Christian calendar, discusses sexual misconduct in depth but makes no mention of homosexual sex. The Tripitaka does, however, contain passing references to homosexuality and transsexuality. For example, homosexuality is found in the case of a monk, called Wakkali, who became a monk because he was so attracted to how handsome Buddha was. There is also a case where a novice monk masturbated to a high ordained monk. Buddhism in Sri Lanka mostly focuses on sex on a non-discriminatory basis. It holds the view that sex is 'dirty' or 'immoral' and this is reflected in modern-day discussion about sex, including discussion on same-sex relations. The monastic rules state that monks should be celibate, but note that these rules do not extend to the lay people. Ground Views shares the opinion that Sri Lanka without colonial influences would have probably held a similar culture to that of Thailand. = Ceylon =  Christianity  With the colonial expansion of European empires to the island, also came missionaries from the European church. An observer in the 16th century, most likely a priest from the European church of ethnic European descent, claimed that ‚ÄúThe sin of sodomy is so prevalent‚Ä¶ that it makes us very afraid to live there. And if one of the principle men of the kingdom is questioned about if they are not ashamed to do such a thing as ugly and dirty, to this they respond that they do everything that they see the king doing, because that is the custom among them.‚Äù. Englishman John Knox, who by this time had lived in the country for twenty years and spoke fluent Sinhala, wrote about the King of Kandy; ‚ÄúMost of his Attendants are Boyes, and Young Men, that are well favoured, and of good Parentage. For the supplying himself with these, he gives order to his Dissava‚Äôs or Governors of the countreys to pick and choose out Boyes, that are comely and of good Descent, and send them to the Court. These boyes go bare-headed with long hair hanging down their backs. Not that he is guilty of Sodomy, nor did I ever hear the Sin so much as mentioned among them.‚Äù It should, however, be noted that accusing someone of homosexuality would be degrading their character. = Sri Lanka = The ethnic conflict on the island is often cited as a major reason why legal rights for sexual minorities did not progress with the same speed as other countries. Often political parties that focused on moderation and the 'middle path', emphasising the needs for human rights, would be sidelined in favor of political parties that supported extremist and nationalist politics. Regardless of their sexuality, it is expected of the men to marry in adulthood. The European Union has recently proposed to use its elevated trade deal negotiations to ensure that human rights on the island would be protected. In November 2016, Sri Lanka voted against a plan to get rid of the UN Independent Expert on violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity at the United Nations General Assembly. The push to get rid of the UN expert failed 84-77. Sri Lanka along with Kiribati were the only two countries, where homosexuality is still criminalised, who voted against the proposal.Anti-LGBTI push at U.N. falls short Erasing 76 Crimes The conservative government later announced that the Constitution of Sri Lanka bans discrimination based on sexual orientation. It also updated its human rights action plan to advance further rights for LGBT. It was consequently followed by an announcement from the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka that it would not be able to enforce the criminal law Section 365A if a case was brought before it. In January 2017, cabinet members of the Sri Lankan government rejected the chance to legalize homosexuality.Sri Lanka Keeps Homosexuality A Crime, But Bans Anti-LGBT Discrimination NewNowNext But in November, Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle stated that the government would move to decriminalize same-sex sexual activity.http://www.parliament.lk/files/pdf/constitution.pdf  Culture  There are a number of establishments aimed at homosexual men found in the greater Colombo region, notably in the Mount Lavinia area, home to the annual gay pride, and the city of Negombo, a former Dutch colony on the outskirts of Colombo, with few other establishments scattered across the island. A lot of the heterosexual establishments court homosexual customers and will fly the rainbow flag on gay pride day. It is reported that homosexual sex remains commonplace between younger men and at Buddhist temples. It is furthermore also widely reported that homosexual abuse of young children is also a problem among religious institutions. Equal Ground reported that the media had become far more positive towards homosexuals since 2016, in both English and Sinhalese, rather than the more hostile media climate that much of the media participated in prior to this date; one of the most typical themes in Sri Lanka media was the association between homosexuality and pedophilia. A number of movies and literature works exist that discuss homosexuality though it still remains a small niche.http://groundviews.org/2015/03/25/to-be-or-not-to- be-gay-frangipani-and-the-travails-of-homosexuals-in-sri- lanka/https://www.amazon.com/Funny-Boy-Novel-Shyam-Selvadurai- ebook/dp/B00MTSRD1U The Internet is the primary tool of communication for gays, with yahoo.com, gaydar.com, and gay.com being quite popular. 91% of gay men had lost their virginity by the age of 17. Facebook is also used to organise parties. 21% of LGBT in Sri Lanka reported that they were currently in a homosexual relationship with another male.http://www.planetromeo.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/05/GAY_HAPPINESS_MONITOR_2015.pdf Around 43% of sexual minorities in Sri Lanka report 'high life satisfaction' as opposed to 24% in Pakistan and 34% in India. 64% of LGBT polled were single and not in a relationship. At least 51% of LGBT were out to family, a number that is higher than the number out to friends and to their workplace. Around 46% stated that they share LGBTQ content openly on their social media profiles, with only 22% stating that they would never share such content on their own profiles.http://womenandmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Disrupting-the- Binary-Code-_-for-web.pdf = Terminology = Ekalingika Samsarga - Same- gender sex (homosexuality) Tritiya Prakriti - Third Nature (n.b. does not equate to the third gender) Galkapanava - Male homosexual sex (literally 'rock breaking) As with much of Non-Muslim Asia, intercrural sex has been historically more associated with homosexuality than anal sex, and is basically consisting of rubbing the penis between the thighs or the buttocks or on the abdomen. = Dating and friendship preferences = An informal survey found that the majority of sexual minorities in Sri Lanka found westerners sexually desirable, finding them more 'sensual and sexually adept' than the locals; only around a quarter had had sex with a westerner. None of those surveys had issues with dating someone from the opposite ethnolinguistic group, either Tamil or Sinhalese, But apart from one person, the majority expressed dislike for Muslims (inlc Moors) and did not like them as friends or sexual partners. There is a preference for youth among the community, though social respect for the elderly can mean older people are also able to find sex. A survey found that the locals considered their own ethnicities \\"to be the most beautiful men in the world\\" placing them above westerners, the latter who were viewed as more 'sensual and sexually adept' than the locals. = Social issues =  Sexual violence  Sri Lankan law does not recognize same-sex male rape according to a report published by the human rights organization at UCLA, and the UN has stated that Sri Lankan men are as likely as women to be the victim of rape. The majority of these reported rapes occur during detention by government forces, but it is also suggested that other non-governmental groups also engaged in sexual violence, and there are also no established channels for victims to report their rapes without fear of retribution or shame. According to the report by UCLA, \\"Despite evidence suggesting that sexual abuse of boys is common in the context of sex tourism, schools,care homes, religious establishments and other similar settings in Sri Lanka, and that male-on-male sexual violence outside such settings is also not uncommon, there is unwillingness to acknowledge the problem or the enormous shame and stigma associated with it, and a tendency to ignore or ridicule complainants.\\"htpp://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp- content/uploads/Legacies-and-Lessons-May-2017.pdf It also wrote that a \\"2013 study by CARE International Sri Lanka on intimate partner violence and gender- based violence in four districts found that of the 1,658 male respondents in the study, 28 per cent reported that they had experienced sexual abuse during childhood. Additionally, 12.1 per cent of male participants reported having perpetrated sexual violence on men in the context of their membership in gangs... The CARE International study also found that sexual abuse of boys occurred in schools and universities in the context of ‚Äúragging‚Äù (verbal, physical or emotional abuse of newcomers to education institutions), and that three per cent of male respondents reported having been forced to have ‚Äúsex or physical relations‚Äù with a community leader or schoolboy before the age of 18 years.\\" An issue remains with social stigma, as one activist put it; ‚ÄúMale survivors who share their experiences, experience stigma, ostracism, and a loss of social standing even among their closest and most sympathetic friends, and are re-victimised and further traumatised as a result of opening up about their experience and attempting to seek justice.‚Äù  Discrimination  Gay man feel unable to openly complain about discrimination due to the social stigma attached to being homosexual, and this reflects the wider problem of homophobia on the island.

His disappearance received national coverage and was profiled extensively in a book by journalist and crime writer Diane Fanning concerning Perry's relative, Bobbie Jo Stinnett, who was murdered and had her unborn child stolen in 2004. Perry disappeared on the afternoon of April 11, 2001 after walking out of his house, having told his visiting friend that he was returning a pair of jumper cables to an exterior shed. This was the last time he was seen. After several years of investigation, police arrested Jack Wayne Rogers of Fulton, Missouri, on various charges unrelated to Perry's disappearance. In their investigation, they recovered message board posts made from Rogers's home computer that described a first-hand account of Perry's rape and murder. Rogers denied any involvement, and was sentenced to 30 years in prison on the unrelated charges in 2004. Timeline =Background= Branson Kayne Perry was born February 24, 1981, and raised in Skidmore, Missouri. He graduated from Nodaway-Holt High School in 1999. After graduating, Perry worked odd jobs, including work as a roofer and helping maintain a traveling petting zoo in the area. Perry resided with his father at 304 West Oak Street in Skidmore. His parents were recently divorced. Perry suffered from tachycardia, a condition that made his heart race excessively. He was a black belt in hapkido. On April 7, 2001, Perry visited the home of his neighbor Jason Biermann and was inadvertently drugged. While intoxicated, Perry allegedly danced around the house nude, shaved his pubic hair, and then engaged in sex with Biermann. After the incident, Perry confessed it to his father and was upset as he felt he had been taken advantage of. Perry's father, Bob, said he knew that his son was homosexual and suspected he had had encounters with men in the past, and was angry with Biermann for \\"drugging and then using his son.\\" =Disappearance= On the afternoon of April 11, 2001, Perry invited his friend, Jena, over to his house to help clean the residence as Perry's father, Bob, who had recently been hospitalized, was due to return home. At this same time, two other unnamed men were outside the residence working on Perry's father's car, which needed a new alternator. At approximately 3:00 p.m., Perry told Jena he was going to take a pair of jumper cables outside to a shed adjacent to the house. This was the last time he was seen. =Investigation= On April 12, 2001, Perry's grandmother, Jo Ann, stopped by his home and found the house unlocked and no one there. She found this unusual, and called the residence periodically over the next several days, but got no answer. Upon calling Perry's mother, Rebecca Klino, she found she had not spoken to him either. Perry's father, Bob, was discharged from the hospital several days later than planned, and after his release, he and Klino filed a missing person report on April 17, 2001. Ground search parties were organized by Nodaway County police within a radius of the Perry residence. Numerous fields, farms, and abandoned buildings were searched, but the efforts proved fruitless. During a search of the property, police were unable to locate the jumper cables Perry had purportedly left to return in the shed; two weeks later, however, they were found just inside the door. Over the following month and a half, over one hundred people were interviewed in Perry's disappearance. His friend, Jena, who had been at Perry's home the day of the disappearance, admitted to law enforcement that Perry had recently been experimenting with marijuana and amphetamines. A family member also informed police that Perry had a bottle of Valium in his possession the day he disappeared. Law enforcement questioned drug acquaintances of Perry's in St. Joseph, but all stated they had not seen Perry, and each passed polygraph examinations. Further investigation into the local drug trade was undertaken, but no discernable leads were uncovered despite rumors that Perry owed drug dealers money. Perry's father, Bob, initially suspected that his son had left to stay with friends in Kansas City, embarrassed by the sexual encounter with Biermann from several days before. Because Perry did not have a working car at the time, Bob presumed he may have hitchhiked. Jack Wayne Rogers On April 10, 2003, law enforcement arrested 59-year-old church Presbyterian minister and Boy Scouts leader Jack Wayne Rogers on child pornography and obscenity charges, as well as first- degree assault and practicing medicine without a license after Rogers removed a trans woman's genitals in a makeshift gender reassignment surgery at a hotel in Columbia, Missouri. The victim, Madison Abercrombie, stated: \\"I didn't know his motivation when I went into it. I was under a lot of emotional stress, and it seemed like there was no alternative.\\" Rogers told Abercrombie that he would remove her genitals in a four-hour operation, but complications ensued and he was unable to stop bleeding, after which Abercrombie phoned 9-1-1. While investigating Rogers's personal belongings, detectives discovered child pornography on his computer, as well as evidence of various posts made on message boards under the usernames \\"BuggerButt,\\" \\"ohailsatan,\\" and \\"extremebodymods,\\" describing the graphic torture and assault of multiple men. In the message board posts, Rogers also discussed cannibalizing the genitals of men he had castrated. Among these posts was a firsthand account of Rogers's picking up a blond male hitchhiker, then raping, torturing, mutilating, and murdering him. In the online post, it was claimed that the man's body was buried in a remote area of the Ozarks. Despite this, Rogers denied ever seeing Perry or knowing him, and asserted that the post made was fabricated and purely fantasy; law enforcement, however, suspected the man in question was Perry. While performing a subsequent search of Rogers's property, a turtle claw necklace resembling one owned by Perry was discovered in one of Rogers's vehicles. In April 2004, Rogers was convicted of the charges and sentenced to 17 years in prison for assault and seven years for performing illegal surgery, as well as 30 years for child pornography charges, which would run concurrent with the former two charges. At his sentencing, Perry's mother begged for him to reveal Perry's whereabouts, but Rogers denied being involved in his disappearance. After attending the sentencing, Perry's mother stated she no longer felt Rogers was responsible for her son's disappearance: =Subsequent developments= Perry's father Bob died in 2004. In June 2009, law enforcement revealed they were completing an excavation of a site in Quitman, Missouri, after receiving a \\"credible tip\\" that Perry's remains may have been located there. Over a period of two days, excavators dug a -deep hole that covered an area of around by . At the time, another local farmer who resided east of Quitman stated that law enforcement had searched his property several years prior searching for an abandoned well, but the search yielded no results. In 2010, Klino offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to her son's whereabouts. In February 2011, Klino died after a years-long battle with melanoma. Jo Ann Stinnett, Perry's grandmother, said at the time of Klino's death: \\"Around town, we searched every oil well, every outside toilet. We searched everywhere that was possible for us to think that something could be there.\\" Monica Caison, the founder of the CUE Center for Missing Persons and a friend of Klino, stated that she and other close friends has \\"promised her they would continue to look for her son.\\" In her obituary, it was noted that Klino was \\"preceded in death\\" by Perry, and she was buried beside an empty plot for Perry that lists his date of death as April 11, 2001, the same day he disappeared. Publicity Perry's disappearance was profiled extensively in a chapter of Diane Fanning's 2006 book Baby Be Mine, which focused on the murder of Perry's cousin, Bobbie Jo Stinnett, in 2004. The case also received coverage in a July 17, 2010 episode of the network television program America's Most Wanted and in the documentary series No One Saw a Thing on Sundance Channel in 2019.

The 135-year-old British law criminalizing homosexual acts remains on the books; however, the law is not used and remains a dormant law. The United States Department of Justice wrote that the police were \\"not actively arresting and prosecuting those who engaged in LGBT activity\\" and that the provisions have also reportedly not led to any convictions to date despite \\"complaints citing the provisions of the law [being] received by the police\\". The law as it currently stands has been described varyingly as decriminalized, dormant, and impotent, and it is widely considered to be unenforceable in the judicial system. The Supreme Court shared the view that, while the law did indeed discuss homosexual sex, consensual sexual relations did not warrant a custodial sentence. Unlike in India or the United States, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka does not have the power to amend law, it can only interpret law. Therefore it is impossible that the Supreme Court could have repelled the law, though activists state that the Court should use their powers of interpretation more effectively to protect people who have homosexual sex. It has been ruled unenforceable by the Supreme Court, and both the socialist government of Rajapaska and the conservative government of Sirisena have stated \\" that discrimination against LGBT people was unconstitutional and that the application of sections 365 and 365A in a manner that was discriminatory against LGBT persons was unconstitutional\\". Although the law is not enforced, as fighting discrimination in the courts requires the sexual minority to openly state their homosexuality (and/or associate themselves with sexual minorities), police harassment is often not fought by the victims due to homophobia they may face in their personal lives as a result of outing themselves.  Text  = Of Unnatural Offences and Grave Sexual Abuse [¬ß17, 22 of 1995 ] =  365  Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman, or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years , and shall also be punished with fine and where the offence is committed by a person over eighteen year s of age in respect of any person under sixteen years of age shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than ten years and not exceeding twenty years and with fine and shall also be ordered to pay compensation of an amount determine d by court to the person in respect of whom the offence was committed for injuries caused to such person.  365A  Any person who, in public or private, commits, or is a party to the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any person of, any act of gross indecency with another person, shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be punished with imprisonment of either the description for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or with both and where the offence is committed by a person over eighteen years of age in respect of any person under sixteen years of age shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than ten years and not exceeding twenty years and with fine and shall also be ordered to pay compensation of an amount determined by court to the person in respect of whom the offence was committed for the injuries caused to such person.  History  Article 365A of the Sri Lankan Penal Code dates back to the colonial penal code implemented during British Ceylon. The Penal Code of Sri Lanka was enacted in 1883 through Ordinance No. 2 of 1883. It only covered homosexual male sex but it was amended once in 1995 to expand the act to lesbians. = Penal Code Chapter XVI of Offences Affecting the Human Body of Unnatural Offences = The original text of the Penal Code of Ceylon, first established by the British Colonial government on the 1st January 1885, reads as the following text:http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/67628/64581/F1856665391/LKA67628.pdf  Text  = 365 = Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman, or animal , shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.‚Äî Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in this section. = 365A = Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or is a party to the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency with another male person, shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years or with fine. or with both, and shall also be liable to be punished with whipping . = Penal Code (Amendment) Act (No. 22 of 1995) - Sect 18 = Constitutional Affairs Minister G. L. Peiris attempted to decriminalize homosexual sex in 1995. But during the debate, several lawmakers notified the parliament that homosexual relations between two women were not criminalized under the existing hundred year old colonial act, and consequently the section was reworded to expand the maximum twelve year sentence to females.  Ordinance 18: Replacement of Section 365A of the Principal Enactment  18\\\\. section 365A of the principal enactment is hereby repealed and the following section substituted therefor :- = 365A = Any person who, in public or private, commits, or is a party to the commission of, or procures or attempts procure the commission by any person of, any act of gross indecency with another person, shall he guilty of an offence, and shall be punished with imprisonment of either description, for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or with both and where the offence is committed by a person over eighteen years of age in respect of any person under sixteen years of age shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than ten years and not exceeding twenty years and with fine and shall also be ordered to pay compensation of an amount determined by court to the person in respect of whom the offence was committed for the injuries caused to such person.\\". = Supreme Court Judgements = The Constitution of Sri Lanka prohibits the Supreme Court from striking down Article 365A because the Constitution does not provide the Supreme Court with the power of judicial review. The second republican constitution was amended to state \\"all bills passed in parliament shall become law after it receives the Speaker's Certificate (79), it will be final and cannot be questioned in any court of law (80.3)\\". However, in 2017, the Supreme Court had made a pronouncement and established new case law by saying that it would be inappropriate to impose custodial sentences on people who were accused of engaging in homosexual sex, thereby de facto setting the law legally dormant.  Political Positions  = Political Parties = Both the socialist government of Rajapaska and the conservative government of Sirisena have stated \\" that discrimination against LGBT people was unconstitutional and that the application of sections 365 and 365A in a manner that was discriminatory against LGBT persons was unconstitutional\\".

He is well known for his research in immunology and the study of orthopoxviruses. In 1949, he reported naturally occurring pox infections in non-human primates. Fifteen years later, he isolated monkeypox virus from healthy monkey kidneys in the Netherlands, \\"silent monkeypox virus infections\\". At the time, the virus appeared indistinguishable from smallpox. Despite the finding being of some debate, it gave cause for concern and provided the impetus to continue World Health Organization (WHO) field research into the potential existence of a smallpox reservoir. In the 1970s, he contributed to the immunology of orthopoxvirus infections by being the first to develop means of distinguishing between antibodies due to infections with variola, vaccinia and monkeypox. Early life Gispen was born in 1910 to Willem Hendrik Gispen, a minister, and Anna Maria Catharina van der Dussen.Birth registration at the Historical Center Overijssel Career At the age of 27, he was promoted by J.J. van Loghem and travelled to the Dutch East Indies to take up a post with Professor Johannes Ernst Dinger (1892‚Äì1983). Following the second world war, Gispen succeeded Dinger at the Queen Wilhelmina Institute for Hygiene and Bacteriology in Batavia. In 1951 he was appointed director of Fundamental Scientific Research at the National Institute for Public Health (RIV) and in 1958 he became head of the newly established Laboratory of Virology, a centre he helped design. Three years later, he was appointed professor of Virology at the Utrecht University. Between 1963 and 1966, he was one of the editors of the Dutch Journal of Medicine. Throughout the 1970s, he contributed to the immunology of orthopoxvirus infections by being the first to develop means of distinguishing between antibodies due to infections with variola, vaccinia and monkeypox. As a member of the Health Council, he frequently advised government on matters including the use of enhanced inactivated polio vaccine for immunizing infants. =Orthopoxviruses= Subsequent to experiences with the measures to control yellow fever and malaria, it became apparent that the eradication of smallpox relied upon the knowledge that no animal reservoir existed. Hence, the search for a reservoir continued. Up until 1968, seven suspected smallpox cases in monkeys were reported, but Gispen's case was the only one that confirmed the disease by isolating the virus in 1949. Two orangutans in a Djakarta zoo became unwell during a smallpox epidemic amongst humans. It was concluded that human-to-orangutan transmission had taken place and not animal-to-animal. ‚ÄúSilent monkeypox virus infections‚Äù were observed on three separate occasions during the 1964 and 1965 outbreaks in cynomolgus colonies in the Netherlands. In 1964, Gispen isolated two viruses from the kidneys of laboratory monkeys that were not unwell. The monkeys remained without symptoms. These viruses appeared identical to smallpox. A number of further discoveries of the smallpox-like virus were later isolated from chimpanzees in West Africa and in well sun-squirrels. Despite ultimately finding that this was a mutant monkeypox virus, these incidents gave cause for concern and provided the impetus to continue WHO field research into the potential existence of a smallpox reservoir. A personal correspondence from Gispen's colleague, J. G. Kapsenberg in the early 1980s, revealed that the cases of silent monkeypox were probably a result of contamination. Death He died on 6 December 2000 in Bilthoven, at the age of 90. Selected publications Gispen published numerous papers and has been cited on many occasions.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011.  History  After JJ Clark's dismissal as Queensland Colonial Architect in 1885, various emerging projects were left in limbo. One was the new Bundaberg Post Office, intended to replace a smaller post and telegraph office built in c.1879. Charles McLay, who like John Smith Murdoch was another Scot initially mentored by Clark, submitted designs for Bundaberg's new post office in 1886 to the new Colonial Architect, George St Paul Connolly.Heritage of Australia, 1981, p. 4/57Hamann 2006 There were three of these designs in all - Connolly favoured internal competitions for Public Works designs - of which this one was chosen after revisions between 1887 and 1889. During this time McLay was promoted to chief draftsman in the Colonial Architect's office. He designed the Brisbane Customs House in 1886, a seminal late Renaissance-early Baroque design. He then designed the Fortitude Valley Post Office of 1887, and prepared an unbuilt design for Rockhampton Post Office which was similar in appearance to Fortitude Valley.Watson and McKay The Bundaberg Post Office was constructed in 1890‚Äì1891; it also included a Crown Lands Department Office. The French Cable Co. began exchanging messages through the Vancouver via New Caledonia undersea cable which terminated at its office on the first floor of the post office in 1893. In 1907, the first floor Lands Office was converted into post master's quarters, possibly involving construction of timber stud- framed partition in north pavilion. Additions and alterations to the building were carried out in the mid-1950s, including the tower clock and mechanism, probably including new clock faces, and additions such as the garage, bicycle shelter and toilet block. About 1998, the building underwent major refurbishment of public spaces with replacement of original lath and plaster ceiling with plasterboard ceilings, installation of polished timber joinery and services; repartitioning of area behind public space for administrative offices; creation of continuous bays of private letter boxes within the northern end wing including a projection and new verandah facing Post Office Lane; construction of disabled access ramp to private letter box entrance from Barolin Street; construction of new stair and glazed partition in north pavilion, provision of business mail centre to north of public office, doors removed from corner clock tower entrance and replaced with automatic sliding glass doors, general upgrade of services and finishes throughout building. The work also included conversion of former private letter box area in the western single-storey bay to a lettable external revenue area. At some point in time, some original features were lost, including: * Original sunhoods removed from rear-facing windows * Cast iron ridge cresting (pre-1970s) and roof ventilators (post-1970s) removed * Original rendered finish overpainted  Description  Bundaberg Post and Telegraph Offices, circa 1890 Bundaberg Post Office is at 155a Bourbong Street, corner Barolin Street, Bundaberg, comprising the whole of Lot 11 RP147676. The Bundaberg Post Office is at the commercial centre of the large provincial city of Bundaberg and is located on the northwest corner of the Barolin and Bourbong Street intersection. In context, several notable late Italianate designs are nearby, including the unusual palazzo-form St Joseph's Catholic Cathedral of c.1888-1900. Essentially L-shaped in plan, the original double-storey building is constructed hard up to the street boundaries at the corner of the site. The clock tower is set 45 degrees to the bulk of the building and dominates the intersection; there is a single-storey wing set back slightly from the frontage at both the north and west ends of the building. The remaining rear portion of the site is accessed via Post Office Lane which runs along the northern boundary. This area has been largely infilled with later building area over an extended period of time to provide a business centre, covered loading dock and additions to both of the single-storey wings. In details and represented style the building is in a largely astylar Italianate. The principal street elevations are screened by a double-height arcade. The ground floor arcade columns are square-chamfered components, with the suggestion of a Tuscan capital carried in the moulding. This is sustained across the stilted arcades on the ground floor of each flanking pavilion. The street level is therefore lightly proportioned on a three-step stylobate, the upper level is a verandah with sculpted cornice, Romanesque cast iron columns, and plain masonry pedestals interspersed with a cast iron lace balustrade. The upper trios of wing front windows are set in a plain panel flanked by quasi- pilasters which are scored down their centres, topped with a short floral frieze and then paired brackets to support the pediment above each wing. The two flanking pavilion wing pediments have plain panelled tympani. The first floor openings to verandah areas contain paired half-glazed panelled timber doors. The corner tower is angled diagonally to the street corner, and has an astylar arched window set in a plain stuccoed wall at street level, an oriel bay in astylar Italianate at first floor level, two levels of rusticated walling enclosing three slot windows on the second floor and a voussoired arched window on the third. These are topped by a frieze of plain-surfaced brackets, a clock level with scored and chamfered quasi-pilasters similar to those on the first floor wing fronts, and a miniature basilica-fronted sixth level with an arch containing metal louvres enclosed in a pedimented breakfront, and two flanking \\"aisle\\" bays with orb finials and oval vents in their spandrels. The tower roof is an octagonal mansard with a wrought iron- railed platform and crimped metal cladding, flagpole and weathervane, and the main roof is a simply handled L-shape with two gabled hips. The loggia floor has a non-original anti-slip textured finish. The building has two storeys with a 6-storey clock tower and includes the following elements: * Structural frame: Load-bearing solid brick, stone footings, timber-framed floor and roof, cast iron and timber-framed ground floor areas where clear spans required * External walls: Rendered brick with ruled ashlar finish to principal street elevations and rusticated banding to projecting pavilions and clock tower; tuckpointed face brickwork to rear elevations flanking Post Office Lane; elaborate cast iron wall vents; cement mouldings * Internal walls: Generally hard plastered brickwork; some exposed timber-framed partition walls with V-jointed timber lining boards * Floor: Timber-framed and boarded throughout; moulded timber skirting boards * Ceiling: Lath and plaster throughout; beaded timber lining boards to arcade soffits * Roof: Gabled hipped form with corrugated galvanised iron cladding, cast iron ridge cresting, metal ridge ventilators, ogee profile cast iron rainwater goods and boarded eaves soffits; rendered brick chimneys with moulded caps. Skillion-roofed rear verandah and first floor arcade roof finished with corrugated galvanised iron and beaded board lining to soffits. Clock tower mansard roof clad with crimped metal with flagpole and weathervane. * Panelled polished timber doors, timber-framed double-hung sash windows, moulded polished timber architraves and skirting boards, polished timber staircases. * Cast iron columns to ground floor public spaces and first floor verandahs with cast iron balustrade panels * Timber picket fences to part frontages = Condition = Externally, Bundaberg Post Office exhibits its original design exceptionally well with regard to the architectural conception, principal materials and detail, although cumulative works have resulted in the loss of some architectural detail and overall form, such as alterations to the flanking single-storey wings, painted wall surfaces and removal of the main entrance doors. Internally, original fabric and joinery remains, although cumulative refurbishment works throughout the building, particularly with regard to the changing uses of the spaces, have diminished the integrity of the original finishes. Similarly, works in relation to use and technology such as installation of floor linings, partition walls, suspended ceilings, mechanical ducting, joinery and the like have resulted in the loss of some original fabric and fittings.  Heritage listing  Bundaberg Post Office at the centre of town in Bourbong Street, circa 1930 Bundaberg Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Bundaberg Post Office, constructed in 1891 and incorporating a Crown Lands Department Office as well as offices of the French Cable Co., is a large regional postal facility which is an integral part of the city's historic central civic and administrative precinct, stemming from its rich history and wealth as one of Queensland's great coastal ports. The substantial dual frontage and landmark tower in scale and architectural achievement embody a prosperity and future confidence in the city of Bundaberg which stemmed in large from the region's importance to Australia's sugarcane, mining and horticultural industries, exploited from the 1870s. The scale of the colony and its resources, linked by rail and, in the case of coastal cities, sea, combined to produce prosperous large centres with less dependence on the capital than in other states. This is evidenced in the provincial centres such as Maryborough, Rockhampton, Mackay and Townsville, all of which had substantial masonry post offices erected. The significant components of Bundaberg Post Office include the main postal building and clock tower dating from 1891 and the single storey additions to both street frontages. Criterion D: Characteristic values Bundaberg Post Office is an example of: * a post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870‚Äì1929) with combined Crown Lands Department offices * the Italianate Style * the work of Charles McLay under the aegis of Colonial Architect, George Connolly. Typologically, Bundaberg Post Office built during 1890‚Äì1891, belongs to the second generation of Australian post offices built between 1870 and 1929. These offices are generally assumed to incorporate separate components for the telegraph and postal functions in addition to quarters for the postmaster, and in this case an equal measure of integrated government offices. The integrity and legibility of the original design in internal plan form has been somewhat diminished through alterations and additions, including blurring the relationship of the integrated government offices with the rest of the planning (other than their location at first floor level), and impacting on the original planning of the quarters component. However, the building still demonstrates some principal characteristics of the type including an accomplished application of style and endowment of monumental civic form; incorporation of frontal components such as offices, public spaces, clock tower, loggia and verandahs; and an increased size to reflect the increased volume of a rapidly developing region. With regard to operating post offices, Bundaberg Post Office is one of three \\"Type M3 Victorian Italianate\\" examples built in the period 1879‚Äì1898 with similar characteristics.Queensland University 1983 report As with the other examples such as Charters Towers Post Office (1892) and Warwick Post Office (1898), the large masonry buildings demonstrate landmark qualities on prominent corner sites with clearly defined frontal components, reflecting the prosperity of their regions and scale of their postal activity. Stylistically, the building's Victorian Italianate frontages are a fine representative example of large post office buildings of the period, though Bundaberg is similar in detail to the earlier Classical Revivalism of the Toowoomba Post Office (1879). In its departure from a squared or central corner clock tower with a single principal fa√ßade more typical of designs from the preceding couple of decades throughout Australia, to an angled corner feature flanked by equally weighted frontages, Bundaberg is consistent in planning with Warwick. Bundaberg Post Office is an example of the work of Charles McLay under the aegis of Queensland Colonial Architect, George Connolly. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Bundaberg is a large-scaled building with impressive dual street frontages on a busy principal intersection and a very high degree of landmark quality. This is principally due to its repetitious double-height loggia and verandah screening both of the street elevations and the six level clock tower. It also shares an important civic precinct with the former Commercial Bank and the Bundaberg war memorial. Criterion F: Technical achievement Bundaberg Post Office is composed as a landmark corner building with two equally prominent street frontages and central clocktower, expressive of the dual, but independent, operations of the original post and telegraph functions. The placement of the corner tower on the diagonal to the main plan and street alignments has strong artistic merit and draws the eye to the building in three dimensions, a departure from the more common use of the corner tower at the time. Criterion G: Social value Bundaberg Post Office, built in 1891, to replace the former 1879 building on the same site is important for its association with the development of the city. It provides a visual and symbolic landmark for the local community and is of social significance for the continuity of postal services which have operated from the building for almost 120 years.

Police were called to the scene and determined that the family had been killed sometime in the hours before dawn that day by either a knife or a hammer. No suspects have been identified and , the investigation is continuing. It was the first quadruple homicide to occur in New York's Capital District, the region surrounding Albany, the state capital. A considerable amount of forensic evidence, including DNA, has been collected but has not generated any leads; cultural, legal, and linguistic barriers have also made progress difficult despite outreach to other law enforcement agencies in other large U.S. cities, Canada, and China. Investigators have considered links to Chinese American organized crime; there is evidence the Chens may have been involved in illegal gambling and/or the human trafficking of undocumented immigrants from China. They have also considered whether the killings are connected to two other unsolved slayings of Chinese immigrant families elsewhere in the U.S. during the early 2010s. Background Chen Jinfeng (ÈôàÈî¶Â≥∞; PeÃçh-≈çe-jƒ´: T√¢n G√≠m-hong) and his similarly aged wife, Hai Yi Li (ÊùéÊµ∑Ááï; PeÃçh-≈çe-jƒ´: L√≠ H√°i-√¨‚Åø), natives of Houyu in the province of Fujian on the southeastern shore of mainland China, came to the U.S. in the early 2000s. They settled in the Albany suburb of Guilderland, near a take-out Chinese restaurant owned and operated by relatives, where Jin also worked. Two sons, Anthony and Eddy, were born in 2004 and 2007 respectively. They attended the local elementary school. A neighbor told the Albany Times-Union later that the family lived what to him appeared to be a fairly normal life. He recalled the boys playing in the backyard while their mother gardened and kept watch. He recalled having brief conversations with Jin, whose English was adequate enough. Homicides Around midday on October 8, 2014, a coworker of Chen's at the King's Wok restaurant where he worked became concerned when he had not reported for work or called to say he would be absent or late. He went to the Chens' house a half-mile (1km) away, on Western Avenue (U.S. Route 20), a busy four-lane highway, and found the bodies. Since his English was extremely limited, he had to ask another coworker, a relative of the Chens, to call 9-1-1 for him. The Guilderland police responded, and soon began sealing off the crime scene, later assisted by the New York State Police, whose detectives were seen the following morning combing through the area behind and near the house. The scene soon attracted a considerable media presence, due to it being the first quadruple homicide to occur in the Capital District, as the metropolitan area around Albany, Schenectady and Troy is known. American Chinese-language media, such as the newspapers World Journal and Sing Tao, widely read among recent immigrants, also sent reporters to cover the case. Police were slow to release information, and much of what was reported in the early days of the case came from relatives of the Chens who talked to the Chinese media at a news conference in New York City's Chinatown. Chen's brother told reporters there that his brother's body had been found on the first floor of the small bungalow, while the other members of the family were found upstairs, covered by a blanket. He denied an early report that they had been shot, and later details emerged that the victims had been beaten with a hammer; later accounts said they were stabbed as well. The crime stunned Guilderland, normally a quiet suburb. \\"I've never seen anything like it\\", said Carol Lawlor, the town's police chief. She had grown up not only in the town but in the neighborhood where the Chens lived, which made it affect her even more. Impromptu memorials of flowers, candles and other mementoes were started not only at the house but the boys' elementary school. Funeral services were held in Chinatown a month after the killings, to allow relatives from China to obtain visas and flights in order to attend. The family was laid to rest at All Faiths Cemetery in Middle Village, in the New York City borough of Queens. Investigation Local law enforcement officials said later that the investigation progressed very slowly during its first 48 hours, a crucial period. \\"There were so many cultural impediments, language barriers and an overwhelming sense of fear\\", among the members of the local Chinese immigrant community detectives attempted to talk to, Albany County district attorney David Soares recalled later. The family offered a $5,000 reward, and Soares promised that, to the extent he could, his office would not initiate any actions that would result in deportation against anyone who had information to share, but neither offer induced much cooperation with the police. Technological factors also made collecting evidence difficult. No homes or businesses in the immediate vicinity of the Chens had security cameras that might have provided footage to review. Police were also frustrated when Apple refused their initial requests to release the Chens' iPhone records. The company eventually complied, but Soares said their dealings with it \\"set us back considerably\\". Forensic evidence yielded some information, but nothing that resulted in significant leads. The autopsies were able to put the victims' time of death at between 3:30 and 6:30 a.m. that day. Investigators were able to collect DNA samples that might belong to a suspect, but had not been able to determine who might have left it. =Alleged criminal connections= From the beginning there were allegations that the Chens had been involved in illegal business activities in addition to, or even instead of, the restaurant, such as human trafficking, money laundering, or illegal gambling. At the family's Chinatown news conference after the killings, Chen's brother denied an early report in Sing Tao that the family was murdered by someone who had returned after a late gambling party at the house to steal their considerable take from the event. He did, however, concede that Chen had indeed often had his friends over for low-stakes card games. A World Journal reporter in attendance later told the Albany Times-Union that she and her colleagues believed the family knew more about what might have led to the killings than they were ready to say publicly. Newsday reported a month after the crime that state police had been putting up bilingual fliers seeking information and tips in restaurants and stores along East Broadway, in the section of Chinatown that, due to its high concentration of Fujianese immigrants in recent years, has increasingly come to be known as Little Fuzhou. It also said that an unnamed source had told the paper that Chen had shut down his restaurant two years earlier and his wife was in the U.S. illegally. Since he continued to live comfortably without any obvious income, it was widely believed in Chinatown that he was making his money in some illegal way, the source said. Chief Lawlor said, nonetheless, that there had been no evidence her department knew of that anything illegal was going on at the Chens' house or another one next door that had also been occupied by Chinese immigrants. A week after the killings, the Times-Union reported that there was some evidence to support those claims as the New York City Police Department (NYPD) began assisting by investigating possible leads in its jurisdiction. Chen, the newspaper said, had allegedly been involved in large transfers of unrecorded cash used to pay undocumented Chinese workers at restaurants in the New York City area, the Capital District and beyond, transporting them from Chinatown to their jobs and back and providing accommodation in cities too far away for day bus trips. The week of the killing, a lengthy article in The New Yorker had documented this network, predominantly composed of Fujianese, for whom even the low pay and long hours at restaurants in the U.S. are preferable to the paucity of economic opportunities at home; the author's primary source mentioned having taken a day bus from Chinatown to Albany to work at a restaurant there at one point. Later it was reported that police had found 18 mattresses on the floor in the basement of the Chen house, further suggesting that the family had been involved in trafficking undocumented workers. Investigators were also looking at possible connections with two other unsolved killings of Chinese immigrant families that had occurred elsewhere in the U.S. during the 2010s. In the first such incident, three members of the same family‚Äîa married couple and the wife's sister‚Äîwere found stabbed in their D'Iberville, Mississippi, home in 2011. All were involved in running a family restaurant; investigators there believe the three were killed by professional assassins dispatched from New York City. At the beginning of 2014, another Chinese family of four were found shot in the heads in their home outside Houston, Texas. =Later progress= A year after the killings, Scott Coburn, head of the state police's criminal investigations bureau, said that 600 leads had come in from various sources, which he considered to be unusually low for a crime this serious. In addition to the NYPD and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), both of which made interpreters available, investigators had reached out for help to police departments not only in other North American cities with large Asian populations, such as Chicago, Los Angeles, and Montreal, but to law enforcement in China, as well. Even so, Soares admitted at a news conference around the anniversary of the Chens' deaths that very little progress had been made. In 2018, Robert Patnaude, commander of state police Troop G, which covers the Albany area, reiterated earlier pleas for help from the public, noting that sometimes even apparently trivial and innocuous information has solved cases. He could not say yet whether the killings were the work of organized crime, but allowed that \\"it's certainly a theory\\".

In July 1971, he won a junior regatta between Eastern Bloc countries in the single scull. In July 1972, Frieberg won in the single scull at the East German national championships. For the men, the competition was not regarded as a full championship as the Olympic team was competing at the Rotsee regatta at the same time. Two weeks later, Frieberg won a regatta in the single scull in Potsdam against competition from the Soviet Union. At the 1973 national championships, he came second with his quad scull team and third in double scull. At the 1974 national championships, he came second once more in quad scull but with a completely different team. In 1975, he came third at the nationals in quad scull, once more with a different team. In 1976, Frieberg switched to sweep rowing. He won the national championships in coxless pair partnered with Ulrich Kons. However, this being an Olympic year, the Olympic team did not participate in the nationals. He also came second with the men's eight at the nationals that year. In 1977, Frieberg remained in the eight. The team went to international regattas and they won that year's regatta on the Rotsee in Switzerland. Later in the same month, that team took out the East German national championship title. That team went to the 1977 World Rowing Championships in the Netherlands where they became world champions in that boat class. In 1978, Frieberg was placed in the men's eight that was considered the second boat by the rowing officials. Surprisingly, that boat won the national championships in mid-July. In the end, a composite men's eight was formed for subsequent international competitions including the 1978 World Rowing Championships, with five rowers and the cox taken from the 1978 national championship team, plus three rowers from the second-placed boat. Frieberg, Bernd Krau√ü and Ortwin Rodewald were the three rowers who got replaced. Frieberg retired after the 1978 rowing season.

The character is a former English teacher who is dealing with the fallout in addition to a divorce and a resentful son. Character biography Travis is a good-natured man and loving father. He is a protective, pragmatic and resolute individual who holds a firm personal conviction that everything can be fixed, one way or another. He has been described as \\"the one character who desperately tries to cling to his humanity ... the one person who believes that there is always a way to repair something that is broken and that a corner will always be turned ... [and] a good man trying to do right by everyone in his life\\". He holds a strong belief that civilization will eventually be rebuilt. =Season 1= After Nick finds his girlfriend eating a corpse, he is hit by a car and hospitalized. Travis initially thinks that Nick's claims about the incident are heroin hallucinations, but he believes Nick after visiting the church himself. Nick escapes from the hospital and meets with Calvin, hoping to learn if the drugs Calvin sold him caused him to hallucinate in the church. Calvin tries to kill Nick to prevent being exposed as a drug dealer or impugning the quality of his drugs. In the ensuing struggle, Calvin is mortally shot. After Travis and Madison arrive, the zombified Calvin attacks them. Nick runs over Calvin repeatedly with Travis' truck, and the three watch in disbelief as the mutilated Calvin is still able to turn his head towards them. Nick, Madison, and Travis choose to flee to the desert. The group returns to Madison's home to gather supplies. Travis tells Madison to take the kids to the desert without him; he will catch up. The group inside the barbershop remains trapped, while the riot outside intensifies. While a riot rages, a mob sets fire to the store adjoining the barbershop, forcing the Salazars and Manawas to flee. The group reaches Travis' truck and escapes, but not before Griselda is injured by a collapsing scaffold. Unable to reach a hospital, the group drives to Madison's house, where Nick, Madison, and Alicia temporarily flee. Nick leads Madison and Alicia to the Trans' house next door, where they take a shotgun. Travis arrives and is attacked by Mr. Dawson, who is shot and killed by Daniel. All three families decide to stay the night and evacuate in the morning. Nurse Liza tends to Griselda's injured foot but notes that she will die if not treated by a doctor. Ofelia tells Daniel they should flee with Travis, but he insists his family can survive alone and will join his cousin later. The next morning, as the Clarks and Manawas start driving away, the National Guard arrives and quarantines the block. While Travis says, \\"It's going to get better\\", Daniel laments that it's \\"too late\\", as he watches a guardsman mark the neighboring house. Days after the National Guard quarantines the neighborhood into a Safe Zone, residents try to live normally. Tensions build under military rule. Chris shows a video to Travis and Madison of a light signaling from the Dead Zone. Travis talks Doug into getting psychological help. Liza helps neighbors with their medical needs. Travis learns that Doug has been hospitalized for his mental issues. Dr. Exner determines that Liza is not technically a nurse. Soldiers take Griselda and Nick to a hospital, but Nick's family protests his departure. Liza agrees to go to assist the medical team despite not wanting to leave her son. Travis retreats to the roof and sees the signal from the Dead Zone. Seconds later, he hears gunfire followed by darkness. Chris is devastated that Liza left voluntarily to help at the hospital, but Travis promises to bring her back. Travis convinces Moyers' squad to take him to the hospital to check on his friends. While en route, Moyers encourages Travis to shoot a zombie, but Travis is emotionally unable to pull the trigger. The soldiers stop to assist another squad in a building infested by zombies, and most of those soldiers, including Moyers, are overcome. The few survivors flee and drop Travis off near the Safe Zone. He learns that Daniel tortured Adams into revealing what \\"Cobalt\\" means: in the morning, all civilians will be killed, and the guardsmen will evacuate the city. The group drives to the National Guard's headquarters to rescue Liza, Griselda, and Nick. Adams agrees to be their guide when let go by Travis. The group infiltrates the base after Daniel distracts the guards by leading a horde of walkers from the arena. Travis, Madison, Daniel, and Ofelia go inside, while Alicia and Chris stay behind. Meanwhile, the walkers breach the perimeter defenses and swarm the base. Travis' group reaches the holding cells and free the detainees before reuniting with Nick, Liza, and Strand. They try to escape through the medical ward, where they discover Dr. Exner has euthanized all of the patients. Dr. Exner tells them of an escape route before presumably committing suicide. Before they can escape, the group encounters Adams, who shoots Ofelia in the arm. Enraged, Travis brutally beats Adams and leaves him for dead. Strand leads the group to his oceanside mansion. On the beach, Liza reveals to Madison that she was bitten during the escape. Liza pleads with Madison and Travis to euthanize her before she turns. Travis promises to protect Chris before shooting Liza. =Season 2= Travis and the rest of the group get ready to board Victor Strand's yacht, the Abigail. During their trip, Strand's home is seen in flames, exploding, swarmed by the infected. Travis and Madison pack everything and prepare to leave the beach. Unfortunately, when he tries getting Chris (who is mourning his mother's death) on the zodiac, he says he is not leaving her. The infected soon appear. Travis and Madison throw rocks at them, killing them. Nick arrives in the zodiac and boards with Madison, Chris, and Liza's corpse. They head to the Abigail. The group freezes and silently witness Los Angeles engulfed in flames as the military bombs their former home. The following day Travis checks on Chris, who is in his room with his mother's corpse. When he goes outside and sees the Abigail has come across a raft of survivors, Alicia wants to help them, but Travis tells her to check the radio while he talks to Strand. Travis sees Madison and Strand arguing over him not wanting to stop the boat. Travis agrees with Strand as he informs them they are heading to San Diego. Travis and Madison argue over his agreement with Strand's decision, but he says his priority is the protection of his family. Later that day, everyone but Strand attends a burial at sea for Liza. Travis says some words before Chris angrily throws his mother's corpse overboard. Travis goes to Chris' room to comfort him, but he screams at him for shooting her before punching him. =Season 3= Travis, Madison and Alicia are captured by soldiers and taken to a military compound led by Troy Otto. Travis is separated from Madison and Alicia, and is then taken to a storage room where people are being executed for research. While there, he finds Nick with Luciana Galvez, who is injured. Travis tells Nick that his mother is looking for him. They briefly catch up with each other, before Troy finds Nick and asks about his ethnicity and whether his people dodged the outbreak or not. Before he can leave, Nick asks where his mother and sister are; Troy tells him they are fine. Travis tells Troy that Luciana is dying and needs medical attention. Troy says everyone dies there and tells Travis to take a seat. He refuses until Troy points a gun at him. When Travis is sitting, Steven (one of his associates) tells him his women are in danger. Travis tells Steven he is attracting attention, but Steven says he can get them out of there and just needs someone to watch his back. He is the only fit person left, and he can get them out if he has help. The guards come and take Travis, Nick, Luciana, Steven, and others before they can try to escape. Travis witnesses people being executed, but remains emotionless. He asks about the corpses outside. The hostile soldiers explain, but he berates them, calling them sick, calling their research pointless, and laughing at them. When one of the soldiers, Willy, decides to execute Nick, Travis volunteers. This gives Steven, Nick, and Luciana time cut off their cuffs. Travis manages to attack the soldiers, and escapes with the group. Outside, Steven, Nick, and Luciana go to the sewers, but Steven is killed by Willy and Travis is captured. Travis is taken to Troy, who sends him to the pit. He is thrown in a pit with the infected and, enraged by his treatment, kills them all. Then, Willy shoots an opening in a fence, releasing more. Travis runs towards the infected and kills them. After he is reunited with Madison, he tries attacking Troy, but is held back and sees the reunion of the Clarks. Later, Madison and Travis leave. Troy's older brother, Jake, tries persuading them to go to their ranch, but they refuse. In a brief moment, Madison comforts and apologizes to Travis, who is still in pain after the death of his son. As a herd breaks out, Madison and Nick go with Troy while Travis escapes via helicopter with Alicia, Luciana, Jake, and Charlene. They all head to the ranch. Later that night, the helicopter is suddenly shot six times. Travis is hit with the last bullet, which enters his stomach and exits through his neck; he starts bleeding out. Travis begins unbuckling his seat belt, ignoring Alicia's concern over him doing so. He realizes he will die and not wanting to turn he tries to jump out but Alicia grabs him he tells Alicia he has to and he does not want to turn leaving Alicia no choice but to let him go causing him to fall to his death. Travis appears in the final episode in Madison's dream sequence, through framed pictures in her house. After Madison is dragged into Jeremiah Otto's grave, Travis appears briefly in an effort to pull her out. Development and reception Travis Manawa is portrayed by Cliff Curtis (pictured). The season three episode \\"The New Frontier\\" features the death of Travis Manawa in the opening scene.

Though a strong tradition of transgender people exists in Sri Lanka, and even though these people have been allowed to convert for a long period of time, third gendered people have mostly avoided mainstream discussion on the island. A number of reports state that the concept of third gender is not found on island, but binary concepts are found that are similar to third gender.http://apcom.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/07/MSA_CountrySnapshots-SRI_V5.pdf  History  = Hinduism = The concept of gender changing is very common within historic and ancient Indian culture, and distinction between biological sex and cultural gender was not made.http://www.pucsp.br/rever/rv3_2006/p_scherer.pdf Sri Lanka's third gendered \\"hold an ancient association with a Hindu goddess of fertility to which they are said to sacrifice their own fertility for the sake of others. By becoming eunuchs, Hijras become semi-sacred, and can bless the health and fertility of newlyweds and newborns.\\" The Tamils of the Northern Province have a culture of cross-dressing, \\"so [a male] being feminine isn‚Äôt an entirely alien concept\\". = Buddhism = The term 'pandaka' can be used to trace the history of third gender back to the awakening of the Buddha and the arrival of Buddhism to Sri Lanka over two millennia ago. Buddhaghosa, a monk in AnurƒÅdhapura, Sri Lanka, wrote about pandaka; they \\"are full of defiling passions (ussanakilesa); their lusts are unquenchable (avupasantaparilaha); and they are dominated by their libido (parilahavegabhibhuta) and the desire for lovers just like prostitutes (vesiya) and coarse young girls (thulakumarika)\\". He also stated that they are ‚Äúwhose sexual burning is assuaged by taking another man‚Äôs member in his mouth and being sprayed by semen‚Äù and usuya (‚Äújealous‚Äù) pandakas as those ‚Äúwhose sexual burning is assuaged by watching other people having sex‚Äù. The Pali Tipitaka, the form of Buddhism followed in Thailand and Sri Lanka, and the most complete transmission being held custodian in Sri Lanka, \\"mentions several different types of transgendered states and individuals ‚Äì the man-like woman (vepurisikƒÅ), sexual indistinctness (sambhinna), one having the characteristics of both genders (ubhatovya√±janaka), etc.\\". Peter Jackson of the Australian National University felt that the Pali Canon had significant influence on the third gender cultures of Sri Lanka and similar countries such as Thailand; \\", what makes accounts of sex and gender in these ancient Indian texts especially fascinating is their contemporary relevance in Thailand, which together with Sri Lanka, Burma, Laos and Cambodia forms part of the Asian cultural sphere in which Therava da Buddhism remains a vital cultural institution.\\".  Culture  They are employed in variety of job sectors, especially in \\"commercial sex work, beauty culture, Hospitality field, NGO sector and limited numbers in the government sector\\". = Etymology = The term 'nachchi' is widely used to refer to transgender people, while napunseka can be used to imply a third gendered centric view of transexuals. The term 'Hijra' can also be used to refer to the third gendered community on the island.  Pandaka  The term 'pandaka' has two meaning in Indian languages. The first refers to 'eunuchs' and is of Tamil origin. The second refers to homosexual men and is academically considered to be a form of slang.  Nachchi  Nachchis are described as being a variety of people that do not conform to hetereosexual male stereotypes. It was historically used to describe cross-dressers but now is mostly used to describe transgender people. But they are not real transgender people A few organizations such as the National Aids Council describe the community as being \\"effeminate men who have sex with other men. They also operate as MSWs, and pick up clients from various cruising points. In addition to having clients, they often have regular male sex partners, with whom sexual activity takes place without financial transactions.\\" It is debatable what this refers to however as there is no clean definition providedhttp://www.aidscontrol.gov.lk/images/pdfs/publications/research_documents/TS_to_design_implement_and_monitor_pgm_for_FSW_MSM_and_TG_2012.pdf Other organizations describe them as being a subculture of the transgender community, often as a substitute for the terms such as third gender or hijra.  Pons   Napunseka  A term found in Sinhalese that was historically used in a similar manner to nachchi, but now either refers to eunuchs or hermaphrodites.  Hijra   Politics  The situation in the Constitution of Sri Lanka is the same as the one found in the Constitution of India concerning gender equality, though the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka lacks the powers to repel and create law in the same manner that the Supreme Court of India has. Human Rights Watch stated that third gendered people were not protected by the legal system of Sri Lanka. It called on the parliament to decriminalize being third gender by repelling three laws; Sections 365 and 365A of the Sri Lankan Penal Code, and the Vagrants‚Äô Ordinance. It also recommended that the government passes comprehensive laws to fight discrimination. LGBT rights activists have focused on improving conditions for transgender people who wish to convert to another binary gender, as opposed to the progression in Continental India, where the movement has focused on the third gendered community. There is apathy among sexual minorities on the island over third gendered rights because they feel it would slow down progression for other minority communities on the island who conform to binary gender. = Identification = The Commissioner of the Department of Registrations of Persons, under the UPFA, stated that they will be providing new ID with a new number for transgender persons.  Social issues  = Financial Issues = A significant section of the third gendered community are forced to do sex work or beg for money as a result of being rejected by their biological parents. A disproportionate number of the community lack formal education and are unable to find jobs. A third gendered person explained, \\"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very hard, in reality. It‚Äôs quite alright for the posher Colombo 07 people; they can be doctors and lawyers and such. The poorer people have it harder and are often mistreated, which is why they leave their families or live a life of secrecy. It‚Äôs also really hard to find work thanks to societal perceptions, which again is why you get many trans people who are engaged in sex work or who are dancers,‚Äù. A number of transgender people complain about the high cost of undertaking conversion to their desired gender, in-part because government funded facilities are generally of poorer quality and that a lack of trained staff exist on the island.It has been thought that a number of transgender people are forced to work as sex worked in order to earn money for themselves, though they face the risk of being arrested as prostitution is illegal on the island = Health = The third gendered community often face discrimination from health workers on the island, and can find it hard to change their gender even if legally entitled to.http://www.aidsdatahub.org/sites/default/files/publication/Sri_Lanka_Rapid_Situational_Assessment_of_TGs_2017.pdf = Feminism = A complaint about the treatment of third gender in Sri Lanka states that the gender disparity between men and women in employment shows how hard it is for third gendered to gain employment.

The temple no longer exists, but the temple grounds were designated as a National Historic Site by the Japanese government in 1939. History The temple site is located in a paddy field in the Suematsu neighbourhood of what is now the city of Nonoichi, near the delta of the Tedori River. The actual name of the temple is unknown, and it does not appear in historical records, so the temple is named \\"Suematsu Haiji\\" after the location. From the Edo period, farmers uncovered a very large foundation stone, called the \\"Karato stone\\" and many fragments of roof tiles and pottery in the area, so the presence of a ruined temple what known for a long time. A Karato stone is the stone which supports the core pillar at the centre of a pagoda, and from the size of the stone unearthed, it is thought that this pagoda must have been very large, perhaps a seven-story tower. The clan who built the temple is thought to be the \\"Michi- no-kimi\\", who ruled the northern portion of Kaga Province during the Hakuho period; however, the roof tiles from the temple came from what is now the city of Nomi, Ishikawa, which was under the control of the Takarabe Miyatsuko. The site was excavated from 1867-1968, and the base of the pagoda (measuring 10.8 meters square) was found. The foundation of the Kondo measuring 20 x 18 meters was also discovered, indicating that the temple had an east-west scale of 80 meters; however its extent to the north-south is unknown, and the foundation of the gate or other structures remain to be discovered. From the style of roof tiles and some coins discovered on site, it is estimated that the temple was once rebuilt in the late Heian period before falling completely into ruins. The site is now a public park noted for its cherry blossoms.

It is also known as Carnegie House. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Birchgrove section of the Balmain peninsula was known to the Wangal as Yur(r)ulbin or \\"swift running waters\\". It is referred to as \\"waters meet\\" as it is where Port Jackson's waters meet the Parramatta River at the harbour's narrowest. In 1796, 30 acres were granted to George Whitfield, a private in the New South Wales Corps, resulting in \\"Whitfield's Farm\\", later \\"Birch Grove\\" and \\"Birchgrove\\", which was excluded from William Balmain's large 1800 grant of the surrounding area. In 1810, it passed to John Birch, paymaster of the 73rd (Macquarie's) Regiment, who then built Birch Grove House, the focus of what was subsequently known as the Birch Grove Estate. It was sold and tenanted by a number of people thereafter. In 1860, it was subdivided by Didier Joubert; however, it was largely unsuccessful, only selling seven allotments in six years. The subdivision was later altered by a new consortium of Archibald McLean, Thomas McGregor, and Lancelot Edward Threlkeld, and again put up for sale in 1878, with considerably more success. Louisa Road is named after Joubert's wife, Numa Street for his son, Rose Street for his daughter, and Ferdinant Street for his nephew. The alignment of Louisa Road was crucial to the subdivision. It had to be aligned along the central ridge the spit to create the maximum number of lots, in a single row, with deep water access. It had also been planned not to impinge on Birch Grove House, hence the road's \\"bend\\". Birch Grove House was retained, with a summer house added, on a large waterfront block. 36 lots in the state were bought by the Government of New South Wales for the Birch Grove Recreation Ground (later Birchgrove Oval). Public concerns about pollution and health led agitation to reclaim Snail's Bay. A trust was formed in 1882, and architect Ferdinand Reuss Jnr. prepared a plan of landscaped gardens, walks, shrubbery and \\"big oval cricket ground\\". Reclamation reduced Birch Grove House's garden, but improved the area. The park was fenced in 1884 and had a practice cricket pitch by 1885. By 1887 a dyke wall was formed to reclaim the swamp. In that year the caretaker, Thomas Rose, a man of \\"horticultural experience\\" and two men continued laying out the grounds. The 1890s depression halted work, which resumed in 1897. By 1904 a tennis pavilion and grandstand stood. Other estate subdivisions followed in 1900 and 1911. Today, huge Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla) frame the oval and give some sense of a former landscape estate, although Birch Grove House was demolished in 1967. The house subsequently known as Raywell was built on what was Lot 25, Section 7 of the Birch Grove subdivision, bought by auctioneer and former Mayor of Balmain Albert Elkington in 1882. He sold the property to Duncan Smith in July 1883, who built the house 1883. Smith sold the house in 1885 to produce merchant and commission agent R. William Ainsworth. It became known as \\"Raywell\\" during the occupancy of spinster, Rachel Cole Wells who lived there from 1888 to 1928.(Lawrence] & Warne, 1995, 65) Raywell was purchased by Margaret Euphemia (Pheme) and Catherine (Kate) Lycette in April 1930 who resided here with their husbands George and Norman and other members of the family over the following years. During their ownership, the slate-roofed dwelling was painted a maroon colour. There was a large Morton Bay Fig tree on the side of the house, hedge along the front fence and ornamental palms in front of the verandah. The front and back verandahs were tiled and when the house was extended at the back (sometime prior to 1945) the back verandah was converted to a passage with a bathroom at each end. The garden at the back of the house extended to the waterfront. The Lycett family retained ownership until 1960. It was later converted to flats at an unknown date. In 1979 discussions were held proposing the demolition of Raywell. An Interim Heritage Order was placed over the property on 7 September 1979. In 1980 a new owner purchased the property and supported the making of a Permanent Conservation Order which was gazetted on 1 May 1981. The item was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The new owner also set about restoring the property and converting the units back into a single residence. The expansive restoration project included restoring existing fireplaces, windows, architraves, skirtings and doors, restoring the north and east verandah and cast iron balustrade, replacing the stair with new cedar staircase following original location, enlarging the northern window in bedroom 1 on the first floor to match style of window below it on ground floor, installing three new bathrooms, providing a new kitchen in the north-west wing and installing a new northern window and doors, and providing an open air car parking space in south-west corner of site. In 1987, it underwent further alterations to the first floor front interior of the rear wing of the building. In 1993, it received heritage approval to relocate the garage and a substantial garage was created on the south west corner while retaining the line of the main level of the house.  Description  View along the verandah Raywell is a classical single storey Victorian period residence of bungalow form dating from 1883 with a later two-storey Victorian addition of terrace style house form on the north side. It is sited prominently on the ridge of Long Nose point with sweeping harbour frontage and views spanning from the West towards the Gladesville Bridge, Hunters Hill, Cockatoo Island and Woolwich, North East towards Berry Island Reserve and to the south capturing the skyline of the City of Sydney and the Harbour Bridge. The frontage to Louisa Road is bounded by an attractive sandstone and palisade fence. Much original interior fabric survives. Internally and at the rear the building had suffered from vandalism and its conversion into flats, but many interior details have survived and been carefully restored.

McGrath, in which the author critiques secularization through examining the relationship between Martin Heidegger's thought and late medieval and early Protestant Christianity. Synopsis Struck by the analogies between the thought of the early Heidegger and late medieval and early Protestant Christianity, McGrath discovered that the similarities were far from accidental. Through careful archival work in Germany, McGrath argued (with Max Scheler and Jacques Derrida), that Heidegger, an ex-seminarian and formerly devout Catholic, had secularized Christian concepts in Being and Time. Heidegger's book went on to become a foundational text in 20th century atheist thought, and yet none of its major themes would be possible, according to McGrath, without Christianity. Reception The book has been reviewed by Philipp Rosemann, James D. Reid, Christian Lotz and Michael L. Raposa. On the strength of this work, the Centre for Theology and Philosophy at the University of Nottingham, the theological think-tank headed by the Anglican theologian John Milbank, commissioned McGrath to write a short critique of Heidegger for theologians.

Plans  After the failure of the White Advance on Moscow in August 1919, the Red Army had launched a successful counteroffensive. In October 1919, the command of the Southern Front, led by Alexander Yegorov, had designed a plan to * strike at the flank of the Cossack Shock Group of General Denikin, * destroy the main cavalry units of the Don and Volunteer Armies, * capture the city of Voronezh, * achieve favorable conditions for the dismemberment of Denikin's front and the launch of a subsequent offensive to the rear of the White troops in the direction of the cities of Oryol and Kursk. The main attack was to be inflicted by the 1st Cavalry Corps of Semyon Budyonny in the direction of Voronezh and Kastornoye, in order to crush the White 4th Don Corps and the 3rd Kuban Corps, and create favorable conditions for the 8th Army to reach the Don River.  The course of the operation  On October 13, units of Budyonny's Cavalry Corps entered into battle with Mamontov‚Äôs Cavalry Corps near the village of Moskovskoye. The battle raged until October 19, and the village changed hands several times. On October 19, the cavalry corps of Andrei Shkuro and Mamantov struck at the junction of the Red 4th and 6th Cavalry Divisions in the direction of the village of Khrenovoe. Budyonny repulsed the attack and pushed the White troops back to the eastern outskirts of Voronezh. On October 23, the 1st Cavalry Corps, in cooperation with the 12th and 15th Rifle Divisions of the 8th Army, launched an offensive towards Voronezh and, after fierce battles, seized the city on October 24. On October 26, the 33rd Rifle Division of the 8th Army occupied the city of Liski on the Don, thereby pushing the 3rd Don Corps over the river Don. On October 29, the 42nd Rifle Division of the 13th Army captured Dolgorukovo. On October 31, the corps of Budyonny was reinforced by the reserve 11th Cavalry Division. On November 2, Mamantov's corps counterattacked in the area of Klevna-Shumeyka, but retreated after suffering heavy losses. On November 3, the 42nd Rifle Division occupied Livny and began to advance towards Kastornoye. Kastornoye station was reached on November 5 by the Cavalry Corps of Budyonny and troops of the 8th and 13th armies. In a new counterattack, troops of the White Army retook Liski, Talovaya, Novokhopyorsk and Bobrov. This created a threat that the Whites would reoccupy Voronezh. From 5 to 15 November, the 42nd Rifle and 11th Cavalry Divisions from the North, the 12th Rifle and 6th Cavalry Divisions from the South and the 4th Cavalry Division from the East, under cover of a serious snowstorm, launched a new attack and seized Kastornoye. By the end of November 16, the area was clear of Whites troops. On November 19, the Cavalry Corps of Budyonny was expanded into the 1st Cavalry Army.  Consequences  In the course of the operation, Soviet troops advanced up to 250 kilometers, defeated the main forces of the White cavalry and, threatening the flank and rear of the Volunteer Army, contributed to their defeat in the Orel‚ÄìKursk operation. The Voronezh‚ÄìKastornoye operation is the first battle during the Russian Civil War with massive use of large cavalry formations.

During the twenty-year period of Italy's fascist era, he strenuously opposed the regime before being sent into internal exile in 1942 and then being jailed in 1943.  Life  Tommaso Fiore was born in a working-class family on 7 March 1884. After completing higher education in a seminary school located in Conversano (as it was normal at that time for gifted students who couldn't afford public high schools), he studied classical literature at university and then he taught inside Italian classical lyceum schools. His interest were mostly focused on the poverty of South Italy's peasants and he struggled with his thoughts to find a solution to Southern Italy's economic failure (in Italian such scholars are called ). He was also a strenuous socialist and he always fought for Independence and federalism of South Italy. He also studied the poverty and other issues related to Southern Italy's peasants. In 1920s he became mayor of Altamura, his hometown and he was a courageous opponent of fascism.

It describes describing the hitherto ignored issues related to robots that have been involved in human fatalities. Plot The documentary investigates the 2015 killing by a robot of an assembly line manager in a Volkswagen factory in Germany, a driverless Tesla car that hit a white truck ahead of it and the use of drones by the police in the USA (especially in Dallas) to drop bombs on snipers and suspects. It also follows the use of artificial intelligence in facial tracking, use of robots in Japan including hotels manned by them, Geminoids in Japan, and the use of facial recognition for targeted marketing. The films uses Isaac Asimov's \\"Three Laws of Robotics\\", first proposed by him in his 1942 short story Runaround, and describes how human beings have in recent years ignored them. The film follows these with interviews with experts in the field, footage of real robots being used for bomb disposal and \\"smart guns\\" that are able to shoot people automatically based on facial recognition. The film questions the morality of these uses and highlights the inadequacy of the current legal structure to address these issues.  Reception  The Truth About Killer Robots premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 2018. The Hollywood Reporter found the film interesting, but was critical of the fact that it does not address the widespread use of drones in war torn areas to kill civilians and suspects.

Nominated trees are shortlisted by a panel of experts before going to public votes to select a tree of the year for each of the four constituent countries of the United Kingdom. The panel then selects one of these to become Britain's tree of the year and be nominated for the following year's European Tree of the Year. The competition has been run each year since 2014.  History  The European Tree of the Year competition has been running since 2011 and selects a tree from participating countries (now 13 in number) by public vote. It was inspired by an earlier Czech national contest. Most countries hold a national poll to select their entrant for each year. Nominations are made in the year preceding the award. The United Kingdom did not enter the competition until 2013 when Niel Gow's Oak and the Oak at the Gate of the Dead were nominated for Scotland and Wales respectively for entry into the 2014 award. These trees finished seventh and ninth out of the 10 entries for that year. The following year the Woodland Trust, a nationwide conservation charity, took responsibility for nominating British entries into the competition. It instigated national competitions in England, Wales and Scotland. The winners of this competition were entered into the European Tree of the Year awards for 2015. In 2015, the British awards were widened to include Northern Ireland. The Woodland Trust altered the format in 2016, introducing an additional round of voting to name a single tree of the year for the whole country. All four national winners were still entered into the European competition. From 2017, only the overall British winner is entered into the European Tree of the Year awards. Format The four national competitions are run in September and October and ranking is determined by public vote on the Woodland Trust website. Nominations can be made by any individual or organisation by early August and a shortlist is compiled by a panel of independent experts to put forward to the public vote. Each national winner receives a ¬£1000 grant from the People's Postcode Lottery to be used for any purpose in relation to the tree ‚Äì this could range from a survey or health check, remedial works, plaques and signs or a celebratory event. A selection of the shortlisted trees will also receive grants of ¬£500. Following the public vote one of the four trees will be selected by a panel of experts to become Britain's Tree of the Year and be nominated as the British entry into the European awards, voting for which runs through January and February of the following year. In 2018 the Woodland Trust switched format such that the overall British winner was decided by a public vote co-ordinated with the BBC's The One Show.

It is also known as Balmain to Greenwich Electric Cable Tunnel. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The tunnel was built between Long Noise Point, Birchgrove, and Manns Point, Greenwich, from 1913 to 1926 to carry submarine electricity cables for the electric tramway system on the north side of the Harbour as submarine cables laid across the bed of the harbour had suffered damage from ships and their anchors. It was one of Australia's major engineering feats at the time of construction, and was the first tunnel completed under Sydney Harbour. The first tram route on the northern side of the harbour was established in September 1893 and stretched between Falcon Street, North Sydney and Spit Road. It was extended to Mosman Bay in 1896. Steam trams already ran south of the harbour and by 1904 the conversion of this network to electricity was well underway. The railway and tramway power stations at White Bay and Ultimo were increasing their capacity and a new electric substation was constructed at North Sydney to serve the expanding tramway system. Cables were laid across the bed of the Harbour to feed the power from White Bay to North Sydney. The obvious location was the shortest distance which was between Long Nose Point and Manns Point at Greenwich. By 1912 the expansion of the tramway network and need for more power and communication meant that more cables were required. To protect these cables it was decided to construct a tunnel to house them. Work commenced in October 1913 at the Long Nose Point end, at the corner of Louisa Road and Numa Street. The steam railway service from Hornsby to St Leonards was established in 1890 and extended to Milsons Point in 1893. This service was converted to electricity in 1927, the year after the completion of the tunnel. = First tunnel = The tunnel construction job itself was a series of \\"Homeric battles\\": The work was started from three points; Long Nose Point, Greenwich, and a shaft at the extreme end of Mann Point, which is a continuation, more or less, of Greenwich. Initially progress was rapid, however some problems were encountered. First of all, the residents of Long Nose Point, in letters and protests very much to the point, caused the abandonment of work from the Long Nose end after a considerable distance had been excavated. Work, therefore, progressed slowly on from the north side until about May 1915, when a large fissure in the rock was found in the approximate middle of the Parramatta River. The only solution was to seal up the tunnel and patch the fissure. A bulkhead was built into the tunnel to stop the progress of the sand, water and silt and a staging was built in the middle of the river and drills were bored through the riverbed. Pipes were inserted through the holes and a cement mixture was gradually pumped into the tunnel in the vicinity of the fissure. The cement pumping operation was repeated through three other pipes in line with the original ones and the tunnel was sealed twice and allowed to set. The door was then re-opened and the silt and sand removed. A second sealing showed signs of weakness so it was decided to abandon the top tunnel and go deeper into the rock. A permanent bulkhead was built into the rock and the tunnel was sealed up with approximately of concrete that remains today. =Second tunnel= A second tunnel was commenced below the first one. The down grade was increased to 1 in 1.3. The work was carried out with explosives and some progress was made, however; on arrival at the point immediately below the original break-in, another crevice was struck and water rushed in. On this occasion, the engineer in chief, R. L. Rankin and the resident engineer W. R. H. Melville, decided to go with the foreman and have a look at the fissure that had flooded the tunnel. Placing candles on pieces of wood, they swam approximately into the centre of the tunnel. It was a risky job. The surface of the water was less than a yard from the top of the tunnel and if the inflow had suddenly increased, they would have been caught. The break-in was later sealed by placing pipes, approximately long, into the crevice, and the whole of the tunnel in the immediate vicinity was packed with bags of clay and tightly rammed. In front of this was placed a steel bulkhead with a steel door and through the bulkhead pipes were laid right into the crevice, to allow the water to get out. Through the pipes cement was pumped until finally it was not possible to shoot any more into the crevice under very heavy pressure. This was allowed to set for approximately three months. When the bulkhead door was opened it was found that the inflow had practically stopped. The bags of clay were completely cemented together and a detour was cut at this point to approximately , to get round the crevice, and when the men had passed it they worked back to the original line of excavation. The section of the tunnel that had been sealed up was cut through, the detour filled in, and the original straight line of excavation restored. After going about past the crevice, they struck another small fissure, which was apparently a section of the original one, and water suddenly flowed in at the rate of about an hour. This was not sufficient to stop the progress of the work, but pumps were installed to cope with the inflow. Soon after the men began to work on the up-grade, and here great care had to be exercised to prevent the material falling back on them. The material was cut out by channelling machines, which allowed it to be removed without difficulty. Eventually the work broke through and the opening at the Long Nose Point side was in sight. Their calculations had been made with remarkable accuracy. The centre line, when the tunnel was connected, was only 1/8th of an inch out, while the levels were absolutely correct. Despite careful lining leaks kept occurring. The tunnel was flooded about 1930, whether intentionally to avoid continual pumping or as the result of a sudden inrush of water, is not clear. In 1952 the Electricity Commission of New South Wales was formed to take over the generation of all electric power in NSW. The power stations in White Bay and Ultimo were taken over, but the tunnel and its cables remained the property of the State Rail Authority. During the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge the railway communication cables were re-routed via the Bridge. The electricity cables in the flooded tunnel were completed sheathed and remained in use until 1969, but are no longer used due to ample supplies of electricity now available on the north side of the harbour from electricity substations.  Description  The tunnel is lined with concrete in some areas, cast iron in some and the rock in others. At the centre of the tunnel is a large chamber where pumps were located to remove water. Running the length on one side are cement racks to hold the high tension wires to supply electric power for trams and trains on the north side of the harbour. The tunnel held twelve cables, 8 x 11,000 volt and two 50 pair communication cables. At one end was a pool some six feet in depth, to collect soakage, and be pumped to the surface. The tunnel is perfectly straight, except at Greenwich Point, where it takes a bend to allow an outlet. From outlet to outlet it measures 1,760 feet. At each shaft it descends steeply into the ground at a grade of 2 in 1, except in a section at the Greenwich end; where a steep cut had to be made - there the grade is 1 in 1.3. No evidence remains above ground at the Birchgrove entry point, but the shaft and tunnel structure (and early cabling) remain below ground as evidence of significant infrastructure designed and constructed by State Rail.  Heritage listing  The tunnel was a major technological and engineering achievement and was the first such venture to be undertaken in Australia without overseas assistance. It was a major link in the power supply to the railway and tramway system between Sydney and the North Shore and although flooded is an important element of the development of public transport in Sydney.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011.  History  The former post office, circa 1880 A postal service was established at Charters Towers in 1872 following the discovery of gold in 1871. Jupiter Mosman is credited with finding gold near Towers Hill, with the goldfields proclaimed in 1872, and Charters Towers rapidly proclaimed a municipality in 1877, and a city in April 1909. The initial discovery of gold in the greater Charter Towers area was followed by a peak mass migration of 30,000 miners, investors and entrepreneurs. Extraordinary amounts of gold were initially discovered and by 1898 the Charters Towers district was producing more than 320,000 ounces of gold per annum, establishing it as the richest major goldfield in Australia as well as an internationally noted goldfield for many years. Production levels soon began to decline, however, in the early twentieth century and in the absence of dividends or reinvestment, gold mining on the Charters Towers gold field eventually (albeit temporarily over the long term) ground to a halt in 1917. Charters Towers Post Office (prior to the addition of the clock tower), circa 1890 The first post office was constructed in 1879-80, during the peak migration period and expansion of the town. This was later replaced by the current building in 1892, which was a large double-storey building, with post and telegraph facilities at ground floor, and residential quarters at first floor level. The clock tower was added in 1898 and alterations to the rear of the building were undertaken in 1900. Subsequent repairs and maintenance was carried out in 1905-06 and additions in 1906-07.Warmington and Ward Once the second largest city in Queensland, due to the gold mining boom, Charters Towers has a rich collection of heritage buildings, and a current population of about 8,000. The building was designed in the Queensland Government Architect's office during the changeover of leadership from George St Paul Connolly to Alfred Barton Brady with Thomas Pye and possibly also John Smith Murdoch involved with the project.  Description  Charters Towers Post Office is at 17 Gill Street, corner Bow Street, Charters Towers, comprising the whole of Lot 2 RP 732390. It is a two-storey masonry building with public areas on the ground floor and the original two flats incorporated on the upper level now converted to working space. The post office is located on a prominent corner site to Gill Street and Bow Street, a block back from the main road in Deane Street. This places it in the heart of Charters Towers' conservation area, a mixture of buildings from the late Victorian and Federation periods, including the former DS General Store at 18 Gill Street, of c. 1900, possibly Charters Towers' best-known building, just opposite (now a Target store). The first form of the Post Office was as a symmetrical verandahed building facing Gill Street, with a cast-iron double-storey verandah, deep latticework friezes and a hipped roof clad in corrugated galvanised iron. In the manner of Queensland stump houses, the upper verandah was centred compositionally with a pediment, and balustraded with cast iron lacework. The three chimneys were stuccoed Italianate in detail, with large moulded caps. The central structure at the roof top is a lantern. The symmetrical front is then backed by a long spine of smaller rooms linked by an L-shaped verandah. The apartment windows on the first floor were French full- height paired doors, and the lower windows were broad double hung sashes. The building was, arguably, indistinguishable from any number of pub designs, such as those at nearby Ravenswood. The 1892-1898 alterations made this elevation asymmetrical, replacing the original central door with an elongated porch area to the right side, and a large corner tower. These changes reflect aspects of the (then) new Baroque Revivalism just appearing in Britain. It is not clear from the drawings whether the original front door had an arched top, but it gained one in these alterations, having a large thermal fanlight over a broad three-part setting of door and flanking hall windows. Next to that came the new porch, treated as a two-stepped breakfront with stuccoed flanking piers and paired Corinthian columns at the centre bay. This arrangement framed a central door and two tall flanking casements on the ground floor, with 1:2 \\"Norman Shaw\\" light divisions; on the upper floor an arched central window with paired casement was set between two tall flanking windows with glazed roundels overhead, resembling a Serlian arch or transformed triumphal arch. The central window is also fronted by a waisted balustrade framing a balconette. The vigour of this breakfront largely submerged the former elevation, which was masked further by the replacement of its cast iron columns with a set of astylar pilasters backed by piers, and topped with scroll consoles supporting the upper verandah. This verandah floor was profiled by a frieze running across through the breakfront and then on around the base of the clock tower. The roof was converted to a transverse gable form with the breakfront across it, balanced asymmetrically by a gabled dormer vent. The largest roof feature, though, was the new lantern, an octagonal, heavily layered design with an ogival metal-clad roof and weather-vane finial. A gabled parapet terminated the roof at the west end, and below that was a bay repeating the central bays on the breakfront and counterbalancing the mass concentrated at the other end of the elevation. The early chimneys appear to have been removed. The five-storey clock tower of 1898 is separated from the ground floor by a broad, low pediment moulded into the frieze on each elevation. Inside each is the inscription \\"A1898D\\", the year of the tower's completion. Above the first floor is another frieze, this time plain, and a storey of rusticated stuccoed banding, punctuated by a single vent window. Above that comes the clock face storey, completely plain apart from the clock, and above that is the lookout, more Romanesque than Baroque in its flavour, with colonnettes, a roundel balustrade, parapet gables to east and west, and a four-sided metal-clad extruded pyramid spire, patterned in descending chevrons and fronted on the Gill street side by an equilaterally triangular pediment with circular vent. The building is two storeys with a five-storey tower with some single-storey additions to the rear. = Condition = With regard to subsequent (post 1898) works and changes, the early 1900s included changes/additions to the rear and internal works. The next phase of additions and alterations may have been for larger telephone exchange accommodation in the 1920s or 1930s, and the sheds to the rear, documented in 1937, were primarily for servicing the telephone network. A double-height lean-to verandah has been added to the sing-bay pavilion at the west end of the Gill Street elevation. This appears to have a mixed frame of timber posts and steel tubing, and the balustrades appear to have been filled in with cement sheeting. The long \\"bunkhouse\\" chain of service rooms behind the early design appears to have gone, replaced by a shorter two-storey trailing wing, running back along the Deane Street elevation behind the clock tower. By the mid 1990s the post office had a remodelled retail area, lunch room, locker room, two storerooms, a partitioned manager's office, and a PO box lobby running around the corner under the tower, and filling one and part of another of the breakfronts on their ground floor. Much of the original interior has now been destroyed. The upstairs flat area retains its separate entrance.  Heritage listing  Lower floors, 2013 Charters Towers Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Charters Towers Post Office, constructed and extended in the 1890s, is an important regional post office building which has been associated with postal services for over 110 years. Through its scale and late Victorian/Baroque Revival architectural treatment, it is demonstrative of the extraordinary prosperity of Charters Towers, and the associated gold field, in the latter decades of the nineteenth century. The significant components of Charters Towers Post Office include the evolved main postal building and clock tower dating from 1892 to 1898. The additions of 1906-07 are also of significance. Criterion D: Characteristic values Charters Towers Post office is an example of: * a post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929) * a mixed late Victorian style, early Baroque Revival style with Queen Anne Free Style detailing * the work of the Queensland Government architects Alfred Barton Brady, Thomas Pye and possibly also John Smith Murdoch Typologically, Charters Towers Post Office originally combined post and telegraph facilities at ground floor, and residential quarters at first floor level. The clock tower was added in 1898 along with other significant alterations to the building exterior, with further alterations to the rear of the building in 1900. The next phase of alterations in the 1920s or 1930s are believed to have expanded the telephone exchange accommodation, with sheds added to the rear in 1937 to service the telephone network. By the mid 1990s the post office had a remodelled retail area, lunch room, locker room, two storerooms, a partitioned manager's office, and a PO box lobby running around the corner under the tower, and filling one and part of another of the breakfronts on their ground floor. While these alterations changed the internal planning and arrangements, the exterior of the building was not so affected, at least to its 1898 form and detailing. The first floor residential component also remains evident. Stylistically and architecturally, the post office is an important fusion of late Victorian and Baroque Revival genres in Queensland, with some Queen Anne Free Style detailing (such as ogee consoles on the ground floor, and equilateral triangle-pediments on the clock tower). The vigorous reworking associated with the breakfront, entry porch and clock tower of 1898, are part of an early essay in the Baroque Revival grand manner, by one of its most important practitioners in Australia, the Queensland Government Architect Alfred Barton Brady. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Charters Towers Post Office is a prominent late nineteenth century public building in the city, with landmark qualities and aesthetic characteristics which contribute greatly to the heritage character of Gill Street. It is valued for its prominent corner siting; five-storey corner clock tower with friezes, rusticated stuccoed banding, colonnettes, parapet gables and four-sided metal- clad extruded pyramid spire; two-stepped breakfront porch entrance with flanking piers and paired Corinthian columns; and verandah with astylar pilasters topped with scroll consoles. The roof also sports a prominent octagonal roof lantern with an ogival metal-clad roof and weather-vane finial lantern. Criterion G: Social value Charters Towers Post Office is of social significance to the community of Charters Towers and the surrounding region, as a prominent and valued public building dating to the era of nineteenth century gold prosperity in the city, and as the focus of postal services and communication in the town for over 120 years.

A Mhallami Kurd from Qamishli, he was also an activist who led protests during the Syrian uprising in 2011, and a militant who founded the Mashaal Brigade, an armed rebel group that consisted of both Kurds and Arabs. Under Hilali's command, the group fought against Syrian government forces and the mainly-Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) between 2012 and 2013, during the Syrian Civil War, most notably in the Battle of Ras al-Ayn. Early life Hilali was born in 1979 in the city of Qamishli, in the northern Hasakah Governorate of northeastern Syria. He went to school until the 9th grade, after which worked as a painter. His friends, some of whom were politically active, taught him to read and write in Kurdish. Hilali visited the graves of Cigerxw√Æn and Muhammad Sheikh once. He moved to Saudi Arabia in 2005, before returning to Qamishli in 2008 to open an art supply store with his father. Before the Syrian Civil War, Hilali was involved in a dispute between his sister and her husband. During the incident, Hilali killed his brother-in-law with a knife, which he claimed was done in self-defence. In an interview with KurdWatch in March 2013, Hilali claimed that after the war ends, he would turn himself in to a civil and \\"impartial\\" court for the murder. Syrian Civil War =Organizing protests= With the outbreak of the Syrian uprising in March 2011, Hilali joined with other activists to organize anti-protests in Qamishli. One of the locations where protests were organized was Qamishli's main mosque, near which Hilali's store was located. He supplied water, food, and paint to protesters from his store. During the protests, he met with members of the Kurdish Future Movement, and founded the Sun of Freedom Movement with other protest organizers in the city. On 30 April, Hilali and another activist were arrested by security forces. After his release some time later, he joined the Kurdish Future Movement. He was arrested again on 31 August 2011. During the summer of 2012, Hilali was known for carrying water cans and spraying other protesters with water. The pro- government Addounia TV accused him of adding narcotic substances to the water to incite protesters. This claim gave Hilali the nickname \\"Freedom Pesticide\\". He was detained by the Military Intelligence Directorate for 15 days, and by riot police at the end of July for 10 days. Hilali and two of his friends also shot at the house of a neighbouring man they accused of shooting at the air to disperse protests. Hilali was accused of shooting and killing his brother Huzan in the Corniche neighbourhood of Qamishli on 11 June 2012. After the murder, he fled and reportedly went into hiding in the house of Abdul Aziz Tammo, brother of Kurdish Future Movement founder and leader Mashaal Tammo, who was assassinated in Qamishli on 7 October 2011, in Darbasiya. By August, Hilali had ended his practice of water sprays and moved on to create banners and participate in local council trainings in both the Hasaka and Deir ez-Zor governorates. During the same month he stepped on a land mine on the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border during a trip with another Kurdish Future Movement member to Turkey, and was hospitalized for the next two months. =Turn to militant activities= After his release from hospitalization, Hilali left his wife and two daughters in Qamishli to join the armed rebellion. He first joined a Free Syrian Army group in the Hama, Idlib, and Aleppo governorates, and was wounded during fighting in Idlib. Other fighters in the group reportedly made a Kurdish flag for him. After the rebel capture of Tell Abyad in September 2012, Hilali moved there and established the Mashaal Brigade, named after Mashaal Tammo. Hilali contacted other fighters in Aleppo and Idlib to join his group, and made Ras al-Ayn its base after other rebel groups captured it from government forces in November. On 19 November 2012, clashes erupted between the YPG and other rebels in Ras al-Ayn, with Hilali's group joining the fight against the YPG, resulting in 4 of his fighters being killed on the first day. By March 2013, the Mashaal Brigade numbered around 50 fighters, including between 10 and 36 in Ras al-Ayn, 25 in Tell Abyad, and 10 in Tell Hamis. The fighters included an Iraqi who fought against the United States Armed Forces in Fallujah as part of Jeish Muhammad. The Firat News Agency (ANF), affiliated with the Democratic Union Party (PYD), which oversaw the YPG, called Hilali and members of his group terrorists and mercenaries, and accused him of allying with Islamist extremist groups and facilitating their entry into Kurdish areas. The ANF also claimed that many Kurdish youth defected from the Mashaal Brigade and joined the YPG. Hilali denied cooperation with al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front, whose headquarters was a street away from his, and claimed that his group only worked with the FSA's Hasaka Revolutionary Military Council. The HRMC negotiated a ceasefire with the YPG on 17 February, but tensions between the Mashaal Brigade and the YPG remained high. In July, fighting in Ras al-Ayn renewed, and the YPG expelled al-Nusra and other rebel groups, including the Mashaal Brigade, from the city. Ras al-Ayn then became a flashpoint of the conflict between the YPG and its allies on one side and al- Nusra, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and other Salafi jihadist groups on the other. The ANF accused the Mashaal Brigade of meeting with ISIL, al-Nusra, and Ahrar al-Sham in an attempt to capture Rmelan from the YPG on 16 July 2013. After being expelled from Ras al-Ayn, Hilali headed to the Raqqa Governorate. There, he was captured by ISIL, imprisoned, and tortured for 40 days, reportedly for being Kurdish and secular. He was released and stayed in al-Yaarubiyah, on the northern Iraq‚ÄìSyria border, for a month. He then returned to Tell Abyad, and was again arrested by ISIL in December.

He also played a significant role in the early European settlement of the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. Family Chiron was born in 1746 in Frankfurt, Germany to Charles Chiron and Susanna Schuler. He married Marie Philippine Roger from Sedan, France. Once settled in South Africa, the couple raised four daughters: Susanna Maria (1771), Marie Charlotte (1774), Jeane Marianne (1775), and Antoinette Caroline (1778). Career Chiron joined the Dutch East India Company in 1768 on a five year contract and arrived the next year in Cape Town, South Africa on the ship Grosvenor . As a contracted employee, Chiron was allocated to the Company‚Äôs Department of Secretary for Justice in 1775. In 1782, he became responsible for the accounts of supplying ships and general book keeping duties. After The Grosvenor, a ship of the Dutch East India Company, was wrecked in August 1782 on the Pondoland Coast of South Africa, Chiron helped uncover the cause by facilitating the gathering of evidence from the survivors as he was able to speak English. Chiron communicated frequently with Joachim van Plettenberg , the Governor of the Cape of Good Hope regarding Dutch East India Company employees matters. He acted as coordinator between deceased Dutch members and their families in the Netherlands regarding their bequests. Freemasonry Chiron joined the Zur Einigkeit Freemason Lodge in Germany in 1765. In Cape Town, he met Captain Abraham van der Weijden and a division of the Grand Lodge of the Netherlands was established in 1772. The founding members were Jacobus Alexander le Febre, Johann Coenraad Gie, Christoffel Brand, Jan Adriaan van Schoor, Olof Godlieb de Wet and Petrus Johan de Wit. Chiron served as the first Grand Master until 1776, and again from 1776 until 1781 following a brief absence. Later life After Chiron resigned from the Dutch East India Company, he and his family returned to the Netherlands in 1784. They settled again in Frankfurt, Germany where Chiron was a bank manager until his death in 1822.

His sire was Rushton News, owned and trained by Frank Johnson and Johnson with his wife Mary also owned the new litter. The litter were trained out of Boothouse Farm, on The Hall Lane, in Rushton, Cheshire. Racing career =1953= The pair soon made their mark as puppies when both reached the Yorkshire Puppy Derby final at Leeds on 7 November. =1954= Rushton Mac won the St Mungo Cup at Carntyne Stadium before winning the Northumberland Stakes and then heading for an attempt at the Scottish Greyhound Derby along with his brother Rushton Spot. The pair reached the final and on 9 October, where Mac defeated Spot as they secured the first two places in the competition. The pair then reached the Midland Flat, Grand Prix and Olympic finals (all won by Rushton Spot). Rushton Mac made amends for three defeats by his brother by winning the Edinburgh Cup, Northern Flat, Select Stakes and Pall Mall Stakes to complete a remarkable year. The only negative during the year was a doping incident at White City, when during the Challenge Stakes the pair ran unusually badly and it transpired that they had been given a barbiturate. Johnson offered a reward for information leading to the arrest of the guilty parties. =1955= Rushton Mac became the leading greyhound in the country during 1955 after winning the 1955 English Greyhound Derby. In addition to the English Derby success he won a second Edinburgh Cup and Northern Flat and reached the finals of the Grand Prix at Walthamstow Stadium and Laurels at Wimbledon Stadium. He also won the Welsh Greyhound Derby but was denied a chance to win the Triple Crown after the Scottish Greyhound Derby was cancelled. He would have been only the second greyhound to have won the Triple Crown after Trev's Perfection. He did however hold all three Derby titles but not in the same year because he had won the Scottish Derby in 1954. =1956= He retired in 1956 after an unsuccessful attempt to defend his Derby title where he cramped during the opening round.

International concern about North Korea's nuclear weapons came to a head in 2017, at which point they posed a direct threat to the United States. At the same time, Moon Jae-in was elected president of South Korea with the promise of returning to the Sunshine Policy, favoring good relations with North Korea.. A series of summits were held between North Korea's Kim Jong-un, South Korea's Moon, and Donald Trump of the United States. Trump became the first sitting US President to meet a North Korean leader and to enter North Korean territory. Kim became the first North Korean leader to enter South Korean territory. Moon became the first South Korean President to give a speech in North Korea. In parallel to this, a number of cultural exchanges began. Tensions were lowered on both sides of the DMZ. The summits failed to make substantial progress towards denuclearization or a peace treaty. In October 2019, talks in Sweden began between US and North Korean negotiating teams, but broke down after one day. In June 2020, North Korea blew up the inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong. Background In 1945, at the end of World War II, Korea was divided. In 1950, war broke out between North and South Korea. The United States intervened to defend the South and has continued a military presence to the present day. A cease fire ended the fighting in 1953, but no official peace treaty has been signed. Frequent clashes have occurred up to recent times. At the end of the Cold War, North Korea lost its supporters in the Soviet Bloc. In December 1991 North and South Korea made an accord, the Agreement on Reconciliation, Non-Aggression, Exchange and Cooperation, pledging non-aggression and cultural and economic exchanges. They also agreed to prior notification of major military movements and established a military hotline, and to work on replacing the armistice with a \\"peace regime\\". In 1994, concern over North Korea's nuclear program led to the Agreed Framework between the US and North Korea. In 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung announced a Sunshine Policy towards North Korea. An Inter-Korean summit was held in 2000. Continuing concerns about North Korea's development of nuclear missiles led in 2003 to the six-party talks that included North Korea, South Korea, the US, Russia, China, and Japan. In 2006, however, North Korea resumed testing missiles and on October 9 conducted its first nuclear test. A second inter-Korean summit was held in 2007.Korean leaders in historic talks , BBC, Tuesday, 2 October 2007, 10:14 GMT By 2017, estimates of North Korea's nuclear arsenal ranged between 15 and 60 bombs, probably including hydrogen bombs. In the opinion of analysts, the Hwasong-15 missile is capable of striking anywhere in the United States. There was an increase in militaristic rhetoric on both sides. Thaw at the Winter Games Party chairman Kim Jong-un meeting with South Korean envoys at the Workers' Party of Korea main building, 6 March 2018 In May 2017 Moon Jae-in was elected President of South Korea with a promise to return to the Sunshine Policy. In his New Year address for 2018, North Korean leader, Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea Kim Jong-un proposed sending a delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea.Kim Jong Un offers rare olive branch to South Korea CNN. By Alanne Orjoux and Steve George. January 2, 2018. Downloaded January 2, 2018. The Seoul‚ÄìPyongyang hotline was reopened after almost two years. At the Winter Olympics, North and South Korea marched together in the opening ceremony and fielded a united women's ice hockey team. As well as the athletes, North Korea sent an unprecedented high-level delegation, headed by Kim Yo-jong, sister of Kim Jong-un, and President Kim Yong-nam, and including performers like the Samjiyon Orchestra. The delegation passed on an invitation to President Moon to visit North Korea. An opinion poll taken on 15 February found that 61.5% of South Koreans thought Moon should take up the invitation. The performances by the Samjiyon Orchestra at the Olympics marked the first time since 2006 that any North Korean artist performed in South Korea. The North Korean ship which carried the orchestra, Man Gyong Bong 92, was also the first North Korean ship to arrive in South Korea since 2002. Following the Olympics, the governments of North and South Korea raised the possibility that they could host the 2021 Asian Winter Games together. On 1 April, South Korean K-pop stars performed a concert in Pyongyang titled \\"Spring is Coming\\", which was attended by Kim Jong-un and his wife. Meanwhile, propaganda broadcasts stopped on both sides. The K-pop stars were part of a 160-member South Korean art troupe which performed in North Korea in early April 2018. It also marked the first time since 2005 that any South Korean artist performed in North Korea. April 2018 inter-Korean summit Kim and Moon shake hands in greeting at the demarcation line. On 27 April, a summit took place between Moon and Kim in the South Korean zone of the Joint Security Area. It was the first time since the Korean War that a North Korean leader had entered South Korean territory. The leaders met at the line that divides Korea. Kim and Moon signed the Panmunjom Declaration pledging to work towards a final peace to the Korean conflict within a year and the complete denuclearization of Korea. The agreement also called for the end of military activities in the region of the Korean border and the reunification of Korea. The leaders also agreed to work together to connect and modernise their railways. On 5 May, North Korea adjusted its time zone to match the South's. In May, South Korea began removing propaganda loudspeakers from the border area in line with the Panmunjom Declaration. May 2018 inter-Korean summit Moon and Kim met on May 26 to discuss Kim's upcoming summit with Trump. The summit led to further meetings between North and South Korean officials during June. On June 1, officials from both countries agreed to move forward with the military and Red Cross talks. They also agreed to reopen a jointly operated liaison office in Kaesong that the South had shut down in February 2016 after a North Korean nuclear test. The second meeting, involving the Red Cross and military, was held on June 22 at North Korea's Mount Kumgang resort, where it was agreed that family reunions would resume. 2018 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States Singapore Summit Kim and Trump in Singapore Donald Trump met with Kim Jong-un on June 12, 2018, in Singapore, in the first summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and North Korea. They signed a joint statement, agreeing to security guarantees for North Korea, new peaceful relations, reaffirmation of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, recovery of soldiers' remains, and follow-up negotiations between high-level officials. Immediately following the summit, Trump announced that the US would discontinue \\"provocative\\" joint military exercises with South Korea, and he wishes to bring the U.S. forces back home at some point, but he said that was not part of the Singapore agreement. Aftermath of Singapore summit =Subsequent negotiations= On July 6‚Äì7, Pompeo visited North Korea for the third time to continue the negotiations with General Kim Yong-chol. After the meeting, Pompeo stated that the talks had been productive and that progress had been made \\"on almost all of the central issues\\". However, the North Korean state media criticized the meeting soon after, saying the U.S. had shown a \\"gangster-like attitude\\" and calling the demands of the Trump administration \\"deeply regrettable\\". Pompeo delivered a letter from Kim to Trump, in which the latter expressed his hope for successful implementation of the US-North Korea Joint Statement and reaffirmed his will for improving the relations between the countries. Pompeo announced on August 23, 2018, that he would return to North Korea the following week for the fourth round of talks. The following day, Trump tweeted that he had asked Pompeo not to make the trip because he felt \\"we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\\". South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha urged continued U.S.-North Korean talks. In August, Foreign Minister Kang said that she had \\"considerable\\" consultations over a declaration of a formal end of the Korean War with the Chinese and U.S. foreign ministers.yonhapnews.co.kr - 5 Aug 2018: S. Korea, Chinese nuclear envoys to hold talks Monday Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed support for a declaration. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said he was \\"alarmed\\" by U.S. insistence on maintaining sanctions until North Korea denuclearizes and what he said was U.S. reluctance to declare an end to the Korean War. According to Vox, Trump had made an spoken agreement with North Korea to sign a declaration ending the Korean War, both at a White House meeting on June 1, and during the Singapore Summit. However, National Security Adviser John Bolton and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis both opposed signing the declaration before denuclearization. =Return of remains of US soldiers= After the Trump-Kim summit, North Korea searched for and returned the remains of U.S. POWs and MIAs from the Korean War. On July 27 North Korea handed over 55 boxes of human remains, thus starting to fulfill their pledge in the Singapore declaration. The remains were saluted in a ceremony in their honor by US soldiers.BBC More than 36,000 American troops died during the Korean War, but some 7,700 remain unaccounted for, including 5,300 believed to have died in North Korea. The remains of 220 soldiers were recovered from North Korea during the years 1996-2005.NYTIMES North Korea reported to the U.S. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency that they could not be sure how many individuals were represented in each of the 55 boxes.3 Aug 2018:Remains returned from North Korea ‚Äòconsistent‚Äô with being American and from the Korean War, Pentagon says Remains returned from North Korea ‚Äòconsistent‚Äô with being American and from the Korean War, Pentagon says  CNBC News] After the failure of the Hanoi Summit, the US suspended the program. By October 2019, it was reported that 35‚Äì40 servicemen had been identified. =Dismantling of rocket launch sites= North Korea dismantled the various significant parts and permanent structure of the Sohae ICBM missile and satellite launching station. A North Korean Unha-3 rocket at a launch pad On July 24, North Korea began to dismantle a rocket launch site at Tonchang, an action which Kim had pledged to Trump. South Korean President Moon called the move \\"a good sign for North Korea's denuclearization\\". At the same time, the Sohae Satellite Launching Station was being dismantled. Satellite imagery showed that several key facilities had been demolished, including the rail- mounted processing building, where space launch vehicles were prepared before moving them to the launch pad, and the rocket engine test stand. According to the analyst website 38 North, the Sohae Station was believed to have played an important part in North's ICBM program, and its dismantlement represented a first step towards fulfilling Kim's commitment to disarmament. By August 7, there was more progress on dismantling facilities at the Sohae Station, including the demolition of the test stand's concrete foundations, launch pad's gantry tower, and the pad foundation. According to 38 North, these actions had to be viewed cautiously as since they were neither permanent or irreversible. =Other developments in North and South Korea= North Korea stopped its anti-American government propaganda after the Singapore summit and cancelled its annual anti-US government rally. North Korea staged a grand parade for its 70th anniversary without its ICBMs. On 23 June 2018, South Korea announced that it would not conduct annual military exercises with the US in September, and would also stop its own drills in the Yellow Sea, in order to not provoke North Korea and to continue a peaceful dialog. On July 1, South and North Korea resumed ship-to-ship radio communication, which could prevent accidental clashes between South and North Korean military vessels around the Northern Limit Line (NLL) in the West (Yellow) Sea. On 17 July 2018, South and North Korea fully restored their military communication line on the western part of the peninsula. North and South Korea competed as \\"Korea\\" in some events at the 2018 Asian Games. North Korean movies were screened at the Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival in South Korea. In August, reunions of families divided since the Korean War took place at Mount Kumgang in North Korea. North and South Korea agreed to reduce guard posts and equipment along the DMZ. U.S. General Vincent Brooks responded, \\"I have some concerns about what that means militarily for the ability to defend along the Military Demarcation Line\\". However, he assessed the risk as being to \\"a reasonable degree\\" and said that the move represents an outstanding opportunity to reduce tensions on the DMZ. Third inter-Korean summit in 2018 On 13 August, the South Korean Blue House announced that Moon would attend the third inter-Korean summit with Kim in Pyongyang in September. On September 5, during the meeting with South Korean special envoy Chung Eun-yong about the upcoming summit, Kim declared that he wanted to accomplish the denuclearization of Korea before the US leader Donald Trump completes his first term (January 2021). In Pyongyang, on September 18, both leaders signed an agreement titled the \\"Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018\\". The agreement called for the removal of landmines planted at the Joint Security Area. North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear program in the presence of international experts if the U.S. took reciprocal action. Moon became the first South Korean leader to give a speech to a North Korean audience when he addressed 150,000 spectators at the Arirang Festival on 19 September. North Korea‚ÄìUnited States Hanoi Summit, 2019 Kim and Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam Donald Trump met with Kim Jong-un on February 27, 2019, in Hanoi, Vietnam, in the second summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and North Korea. On February 28, 2019, the White House announced that the summit was cut short and that no agreement was reached, with Trump later elaborating that it was because North Korea wanted an end to all sanctions. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho asserted that the country only sought a partial lifting of five United Nations sanctions placed on North Korea during 2016‚Äì17. DMZ meeting, 2019 Kim and Trump at the DMZ President Trump and Chairman Kim speaking to reporters. In April 2019 Trump tweeted that a third summit between him and Kim \\"would be good\\". On June 12, 2019, he received a letter from Kim which he described as \\"beautiful\\". On June 26, 2019, it was announced that talks were underway to hold a third U.S.‚ÄìNorth Korean summit. On June 22, 2019, an undated photo was also released by the North Korean government of Kim Jong-un reading a letter from Trump. Kim described the letter as \\"excellent\\" and described Trump as the \\"supreme leader\\" of the United States. However, Kim later denied reports of continued talks with the United States, and relations with the U.S. State Department still remained hostile. On June 30, 2019, Donald Trump and Moon Jae-in met with Kim Jong-un at the DMZ. The meeting was apparently the result of an impromptu Trump tweet suggesting a possible meeting with Kim at the DMZ \\"just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!\\". When they met, Trump and Kim shook hands, and Kim said in English, \\"It's good to see you again\\", \\"I never expected to meet you at this place\\", and \\"You are the first US President to cross the border\\". They briefly crossed the border into North Korea before crossing back into South Korea. After meeting at the border, Trump, Kim and Moon Jae-in entered the Inter-Korean House of Freedom for approximately one hour. A result of the brief meeting was that both U.S. and North Korea agreed to set up teams to resume denuclearization talks, which had previously stalled at the Hanoi Summit earlier in the year. The meeting has been reported as historic as it was the first time a sitting U.S. president has set foot in North Korea; former US Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton had previously visited North Korea after they left office. Subsequent developments in 2019 and 2020 During 2019, North Korea conducted a series of short‚Äìrange missile tests, while the US and South Korea took part in joint military drills in August. On 16 August 2019, North Korea's ruling party made a statement criticizing the South for participating in the drills and for buying US military hardware, calling it a \\"grave provocation\\". On December 7, 2019, a spokesman for North Korea's Defense Academy announced that an important test had been conducted at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station, but no details were forthcoming.38North: North Korea's Rocket Engine Test: What We Know and Don't Know: https://www.38north.org/2019/12/melleman121019/North Korea Conducts 'Important Test' at Previously Dismantled Rocket Launch Site https://time.com/5746075/north-korea-rocket-launch-test/ On September 10, 2019, Trump tweeted that he had asked Bolton for his resignation which was given shortly thereafter. North Korea had previously called John Bolton a \\"warmonger\\". Pro-North Korean newspaper Chosun Sinbo welcomed Bolton's resignation, stating that he was to blame for breaking off the February summit in Hanoi. Trump had disagreed with Bolton's advocacy of \\"Libyan model\\" for North Korea. Bolton subsequently repudiated Trump's policy, saying that North Korea was becoming more dangerous. On 23 September 2019, Trump and Moon met in New York, at the time of the 74th United Nations General Assembly session. Trump downplayed the seriousness of North Korea's short-range missiles stating that they had not been covered by an agreement and describing them as \\"nothing spectacular\\". Both Trump and Moon expressed support for continuing negotiations. As agreed at the DMZ summit, talks began in Stockholm on 5 October 2019 between US and North Korean negotiating teams. After one day, the North Koreans said that talks had broken down, blaming US inflexibility. The US team, however, said discussions were good, and would be resumed. In May 2020, saying he intended to employ \\"new policies\\", Kim met with the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party and discussed boosting North Korea's nuclear deterrent. The augmentation of conventional artillery was discussed as well.Two years after Trump summit, Kim vows to boost North Korea's nuclear deterrent, Washington Post, Simon Denyer, May 24, 2020. Retrieved June 16, 2020. On June 5, 2020, the North Korean foreign minister Ri Son-gwon said that prospects for peace between North and South Korea, and the U.S., had \\"faded away into a dark nightmare\\". He indicated that subsequent to the meeting with Trump, the North's efforts had focused instead on amassing a more \\"reliable force to cope with the long-term military threats from the U.S.\\". On June 13, Kim Yo-jong, sister of Kim Jong-un, warned that \\"before long, a tragic scene of the useless North-South joint liaison office completely collapsed would be seen\\". On June 16, the North threatened to return troops that had been withdrawn from the border to posts where they had been previously stationed. Later that day, the liaison office in Kaesong was blown up by the North Korean government. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the South Korean delegation had left the building in January.North Korea Blows Up Liaison Office Shared With South Korea, New York Times, Choe Sang-hun, June 16, 2020. Retrieved June 16, 2020. In September, Moon and Kim exchanged friendly letters about COVID-19 and the typhoons that had hit Korea. On 22 September, Moon addressed the UN General Assembly and called for a \\"permanent peace regime\\" in Korea. Kelly Craft, the US ambassador to the UN, backed his call and said that there had been significant progress in negotiations so far. On the same day, the crew of a North Korean patrol boat killed a South Korean fisheries officer whom they encountered off their coast and torched his flotation device. Kim apologized to South Korea for the incident.

It was designed by E. J. Bowen and built in 1880. It is also known as the Administration Building, and includes the Evans Ward and the Victoria Ward. The property is owned by the NSW Department of Health. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The nucleus of the Balmain Hospital was a pre-existing cottage known as Alderley. Its construction date is unknown; it may have been built in 1871 to the design of Edmund Blacket, but this has not been confirmed. A move was made to create a cottage hospital in Balmain in 1884, and a small cottage near the town hall was obtained, rent-free from the Government of New South Wales. Shortly after, increased demand meant that the hospital needed to expand and Alderley was purchased in 1885. The Evans Ward was added in 1896 and the Victoria Ward in 1901. In 1907 the nurses' accommodation was added above Alderley and a verandah added to the Evans Ward. The name of the hospital changed to the Balmain District Hospital at that time.  Description  =Central administration section= The Administration portion is the central component of the main building connecting the Evans and Victoria Wards. It is a three- storey element, built in the Federation Anglo-Dutch style. Externally the building's federation style features are relatively intact and its characteristics are as follows; essentially symmetrical facade; red brick with painted stone or stucco trim; enclosed verandahs to upper storey separated by an elaborate parapeted gable bearing the hospital name and the date of inception. Enclosed verandah to the ground floor with late twentieth century aluminium framed glazing set in finely crafted brick arches. Painted cement render and painted sandstone to the lower ground floor with small windows providing light to the basement. Simple hipped medium pitched roofs with terracotta tiles. Internally the buildings components reveal two distinct phases of development ranging from the mid-late nineteenth century to the Federation period (formerly Alderley). =Evans Ward= The Evans Ward is attached to the northern side of the administration portion. It is a two- storey wing built in the Federation Anglo-Dutch style. Its fabric both internally and externally remains essentially intact and characterised as follows; small scale symmetrical facade with a projecting bay window. Red brick with painted stone trim. Elaborated parapeted gable including a roof ventilator. Medium pitched terracotta tile roof. TImber window joinery. Original timber skirting boards and trim to ground floor. Ornate pressed metal ceilings, beam encasing and iron structural columns to ground foor. Fireplaces have been infilled on the ground floor. Leadlight windows and doors on ground floor typical of early Federation period. =Victoria Ward= The Victoria Ward is attached to the southern side of the administration portion. Its external fabric is virtually identical to that of Evans Ward, however the slight variation in the colour of bricks reveals that the two wards were not necessarily built at the same time.Brian McDonald & Associates 1996 = Modifications and dates = Parts of the original cottage known as \\"Alderley\\" occupied by the Hospital in 1885 remain buried below the present Administration building. * 1890: Booth House * 1896: Evans Ward * 1901: Victoria Ward * 1907: Facade and upper floor to the Administration building between Evans and Victoria Wards * 1907: Some components of the verandah to the north face of Evans Ward. Modifications to the building include infilled openings. * 1965: tiles to roofs of Evans and Victoria Wards * 1978: Enclosure of verandah at Evans Ward  Heritage listing  The Balmain Hospital (Administration Building, Evans Ward and Victoria Ward) is historically significant as it was one of the earliest cottage hospitals developments in Sydney and the cottage hospital development in medical care was a highly significant component of welfare. The adaptation from middle class domestic housing to servicing the needs of an increasingly working class population provides an important example of the evolving social profile of the area. The Balmain Hospital represents an ongoing activity of rht local community. Its establishment in 1885 was as a result of community initiatives and it is a facility which still has meaning and is greatly valued by a large part of the community in the peninsula area and beyond. The Evans Ward, Victoria Ward and Administration Building between them display fine architectural qualities. The physical fabric is capable of demonstrating the full range of development from residential to medical.Brian McDonald and Associates 1996 Balmain Hospital - Main Building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Main Administration Building including the Evans and Victoria Wards, provides clear physical evidence of a major phase of the hospital development, undertaken in the late 19th and very early 20th centuries, as well as evidence of the original hospital cottage which itself pre-dates the Hospital's establishment. Evidence of the latter is limited and less easily interpreted. It may be found to be an Edmund Blackett building which would provide a strong associational link. The fabric of the hospital development phase is largely intact and remains the Hospital's main address as interpreted by the community. In addition to the early 20th century development the building records a series of later alterations made to accommodate changing needs. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Main Administration Building provides the site with its finest orchestral component. Its external visible fabric retains most of the original architectural details and character, with the exception of the slate roofs and the chimneys which were removed. The Evans and Victoria Wards' facades are examples of the Federation Anglo-Dutch style which developed in Britain as a reaction against classical and Gothic Styles. Relatively few examples of this style remain in Australia today making the building rare. The building is a restrained example of this style but nonetheless a fine one. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The community perception of this building's role is consistent with its use. It is clearly seen as a major component of the hospital. Despite substantial changes in usage of some parts of the building, the majority of detailing and the spatial arrangements inspirited in the early 20th century have remained, enabling the interpretation of their original use to be made.

Royal Navy officers currently holding the ranks of commodore, rear admiral, vice admiral and admiral of the fleet are sometimes considered generically to be admirals. The rank did not exist prior to 1805, as the admiral commanding the Red squadron was called Admiral of the Fleet. When the duties of Admiral of the Fleet were separated from Red squadron in 1805, the Admiral of the Red was created, and until 1864 this rank was the second highest rank in order of precedence. In 1864 it was abolished as a promotional rank (pictured opposite is the command flag for an Admiral of the Red). History The Navy Royal inaugurated squadron colours during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603) to subdivide the English fleet into three squadrons. There were three classes of admirals and differentiated by using coloured flags. In 1620 the official Flag ranks of Admiral, Vice Admiral, and Rear Admiral were legally established that arose directly out of the organisation of the fleet into three parts. The rank of Admiral of the Fleet was formally enacted in 1688. The Admiral of the Red was a senior rank of the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom, immediately outranked by the rank Admiral of the Fleet (see order of precedence below). From 1805 to 1864 this rank was the second highest rank. In 1864 it was abolished as a promotional rank. The rank was achieved by seniority among Admirals of the White. Today Royal Navy officers currently holding the ranks of commodore, rear admiral, vice admiral and admiral of the fleet are sometimes considered generically to be admirals. Order of precedence Admirals of the Colour The Navy was divided into three squadrons Red, White and Blue in order of seniority. Admirals were appointed to these squadrons and therefore their rank and squadron split the seniority into 9 bands with ‚ÄòAdmiral of the Fleet' forming a tenth senior to all others. Seniority was therefore from 1805 to 1864: # Admiral of the Fleet # Admiral of the Red Squadron (rank created in 1805) # Admiral of the White Squadron # Admiral of the Blue Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the Red Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the White Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the Blue Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the Red Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the White Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the Blue Squadron Seniority was therefore from 1688 to 1805: # Admiral of the Fleet, (rank created in 1688) # Admiral of the White Squadron # Admiral of the Blue Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the Red Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the White Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the Blue Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the Red Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the White Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the Blue Squadron Admirals without an appointment were colloquially referred to as Yellow Admirals.

It may have originally been lodgings for the Prior of Llanthony. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries the building became a farmhouse. In the 19th century, the Llanthony Estate was bought by Walter Savage Landor who undertook remodelling. The farmhouse is Grade II* listed, with the adjacent barn, Court Farm Barn, having a separate Grade I listing. History The architectural historian John Newman records the traditional origins of the farmhouse as a lodging for the Prior of Llanthony. Cadw also includes this explanation in its listing description, but notes that the declining fortunes of the priory in the late-medieval period made it less likely that a new structure for this purpose would have been constructed at this time. The priory at Llanthony had been founded at the start of the 12th century but in 1136, a second foundation, Llanthony Secunda, was established at Gloucester and in the following centuries came to supersede to Welsh priory in wealth and importance. By the time of the Dissolution the priory was valued at only ¬£100, and Court Farmhouse was remodelled as a farm building. The frontage was remodelled in the 18th century, but this was reversed by Walter Savage Landor in the mid-19th century, given the range its \\"entirely Victorian appearance\\". By the mid-20th century part of the farmhouse was being used as a cow shed. The farmhouse remains in private ownership and is now used as self-catering accommodation. Architecture and description The farmhouse is constructed to an L-plan, with two storeys and attics. The building material is sandstone rubble, although a significant amount of medieval carved stone is included. Newman also notes the medieval origins of much of the roof structure.

Daoyan played an important role in the Jingnan Campaign. He was left in Beijing together with Zhu Gaochi to guard the base area. Zhu Di asked him for strategy through letters before important battles. Daoyan suggested driving south to attack Nanjing directly, which made Zhu Di the final victor.

It was released in Japan on January 8, 2017, and it was published in western regions by Aksys Games where it was released on October 31, 2017. Inspired by traditional horror, the story follows a group of teenage friends who journey into an abandoned mansion with the intent of recording their experiences for an online video, and soon find themselves on the run from a terrifying figure. Players control Arisa, a Japanese exchange student, who must use only her wits and what's around her to find her friends and escape with her life. As with many other horror games, the main story is left purposefully vague and ambiguous, with in-game materials providing supplementary information on the game's background and lore.  Story  An abandoned mansion has recently been the subject of monster sightings and rumored disappearances among students. Arisa, a Japanese exchange student living in America, journeys to the mansion alongside her school friends, Bob, Emily; who is Bob's sister, and her supposed \\"loverboy\\", Ken, at the bequest of Bob. Bob wishes to film an online video of the mansion and wants a \\"cute girl in a uniform\\" in it to rack in views. After entering the mansion, an earthquake causes part of the flooring to cave in, and Arisa falls into the caves below the mansion, separated from the others, and without cell phone reception. While attempting to escape the caves, she encounters a shovel-wielding \\"monster\\", who subsequently stalks her to attempt to kill her. Arisa ultimately encounters Emily and the two escape into the mansion above. After discovering that the bridge that allows escape from the premises has been destroyed, Arisa encounters a robed figure with an intent to specifically stalk her and is saved from her first encounter with the figure by a timely arrival from Bob. After restoring power to the mansion, Arisa discovers a route to another building nearby. Bob gets injured during another confrontation with the robed figure, and Arisa journeys to the other building by herself. On her way there she is saved from falling to her death by Ken. Ken says that he has been hiding in the other building, a hospital. Arisa explores the hospital and uncovers bandages, and then discovers that Ken is missing. Arisa either returns immediately to the mansion to find an alive Emily and Bob, or she returns after a failed hunt for Ken and discovers their dead bodies. Arisa returns to the hospital to looks for Ken, and either does or does not uncover a document that proves Ken's identity as the robed stalker, before discovering the information regarding an escape route. Depending on who is currently alive and what information she has uncovered, Arisa either escapes on her own, escapes with just Emily and Bob, escapes with Emily, Bob, and Ken, or escapes with just Ken, after which Arisa seemingly kills the \\"shovel monster\\" during a final confrontation. If the escapees do not have the knowledge of Ken's true intent (all four/Arisa and Ken) they encounter the \\"shovel monster\\" again, whereas if they know Ken's true intent (Arisa, Emily and Bob/just Arisa) they are instead confronted by the robed stalker, who reveals that he is, indeed, Ken. Arisa is stalked one last time, either by the shovel-monster, or by the crazed Ken, up a series of ladders; in the case of the latter, Ken has been revealed as a mentally unsound stalker of Arisa who thinks that his divine purpose from God is to be with Arisa and to kill anyone else who gets near her. The stalker falls, seemingly to their death. If the final stalker was the \\"shovel monster\\", he mentions the names \\"Jessica\\" and \\"Ken\\" before he falls. The rest of the characters survive and reach the surface. = Endings = * Ending A: Arisa, Emily, Bob, and Ken all survive. They reach the surface after escaping the \\"shovel-monster\\", and return to their ordinary lives. * Ending B: Arisa, Emily, and Bob survive after Arisa's escape from the stalker-Ken and are relieved to hear police sirens in the distance. * Ending C: Arisa is the sole survivor after escaping the stalker-Ken. She is found by a police officer, but Ken kills him, and maniacally approaches the terrified Arisa. * Ending D: Arisa and Ken survive after escaping the \\"shovel-monster\\", seemingly safe, and leave the rest to the police. A figure kills the police officers who enter the mansion.  Gameplay  Players control Arisa through mapped locations, primarily consisting of an abandoned mansion and hospital, to progress the narrative and locate a method of escape. While exploring, the player may encounter one of several hostile figures intent on murdering, or otherwise stalking, Arisa. The player must escape from the figure by running away, and can throw the hostile figure off by hiding in one of the many \\"hiding spots\\". The player's only method of attack is throwing items which can temporarily stun a hostile. While she is being chased, Arisa has a stamina meter that decreases as she runs. If her stamina runs out entirely, she will not be able to run until it has fully recharged. Her total stamina also suffers permanent decrease when Arisa takes damage. If caught by a hostile the players take damage and must fight back to avoid getting killed outright. The lower Arisa's health is the harder it becomes to fight back when caught. The player uses a flashlight app on Arisa's phone to light dark areas, which uses up the phone's battery power. They can find chargers throughout the map, which can be used to recharge Arisa's phone. Certain objects, such as rocks, may not be seen by Arisa if her flashlight is not on, resulting in her stumbling or falling over them. Other inventory objects that can be found are rations which can increase health, and throwing objects, which can be used to both get through sections of the game as well as stun hostiles. The player can find various documents throughout the map, which provide supplementary information regarding the game's story and lore. The game has multiple endings, with the ending that player gets being determined via choices that the player makes at a few key moments.  Reception  The game received \\"mixed or average reception\\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. GamingTrend gave a mostly positive review, calling Creeping Terror a \\"fun pixelated game\\", that, while unlikely to \\"make you jump, will likely raise the hairs on the back of your neck\\". Although they considered the gameplay \\"overly simplistic\\", they expressed that the \\"excellent music and graphics\\" made up for this. However GameSpew was more critical, stating that while the game wasn't \\"devoid of any good moments\\", they were \\"sparsely spaced\\", and were critical of the amount of time that is spent walking through empty hallways. They felt that the 3DS has a lack of \\"chops\\" to create a \\"true horror experience\\", and that Creeping Horror \\"isn't immune\\" to this. Destructoid called the game \\"serviceable\\" and appreciated the game's tribute to a \\"bygone era of horror gaming\\", but otherwise considered it a \\"toss-away title\\". Cubed 3 called the production value and graphics impeccable, stating that they look \\"incredible for a 3DS game\\". Although they felt that the \\"main event\\", the game's \\"stalkers\\", were undermined by a lack of challenge and difficulty, as well as being generic and uninteresting. They considered all the \\"working pieces\\" for a definitive 3DS horror game to be present, but \\"horribly implemented\\", and felt the attempt to create a exciting experience was \\"half-hearted\\".

Following the resumption of the timber yard for public space in the 1960s, the present reserve was designed and laid out by landscape architect Bruce Mackenzie and constructed in two stages: stage one in 1970 and stage two in 1981. It is also known as Peacock Point and Illoura. The reserve is owned by the Inner West Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 29 November 2013.  History  =Peacock Point= The traditional custodians of the peninsula now known as Balmain are the Gadigal and Wangal people of the Eora language group. There is archaeological evidence of human occupation in the Sydney area dated at least 20,000 years ago. Being among the first to encounter the British the Wangal population was also one of the first to be highly impacted by disease and dispossession. Following the Second World War Aboriginal people began to move back to the cities and settled in the suburbs of Redfern, Alexandria and Balmain.Goodall & Cadzow:173 Prior to 1835 the landscape of Balmain was rocky, with dense tea tree scrub spotted with eucalypts and abundant flora and fauna.Reynolds and Irving: 4 The Sydney Gazette of 1818 shows a grant to William Balmain: an estate consisting of 550 acres at the Northern Boundary known by the name of Balmain's Farm.Reynolds and Flottman: 92 Prior to returning to England, Balmain transferred the land to John Gilchrist. Gilchrist subsequently subdivided the land and in 1836 auctioneer George William Paul purchased Lot 4 and Lot 6 of the first portion to be divided into 22 lots located on the Balmain East end of the peninsula. In 1855 Mort's Dock opened in Waterview Bay and was indicative of the intense maritime industrial expansion on the edges of the peninsula. The suburban development of Balmain commenced from 1836 and grew slowly until the new industrial development of the 1850s onwards drew an influx of workers and their families to live on the peninsula. A ferry service commenced about this time connecting the suburb to the city bringing workers for the shipyards along the harbour foreshores. As the population increased so did the demand for services - houses, shops, churches, schools, police, a hospital and local government with Balmain Council being formed in 1860. Social institutions also arose at this time and many clubs were formed including rowing, swimming, bowling and cricket. Institutes such as the Balmain Literary Institute, the Balmain Working Men's Institute and Balmain School of Arts were also established. The lots between Peacock Point and Darling Street and Weston Street which had been laid out in 1836 had a number of owners. Immediately adjacent to Illoura Reserve was 2-8 Weston Street which was purchased in 1840 by shipwright John Bell and on which he built a stone wharf and shipwright's yard. Bell died in 1847 and the shipwright's yard was run by his sons until 1883 when it was sold to J. Fenwick and Co. The southern end of the peninsula is named after Captain John Jenkins Peacock who purchased the land in 1836. Peacock was the son of a convict and started his days as a farmer with a grant of 250 acres on the Hawkesbury. In 1834 he moved to Market Wharf after a time trading between the Hawkesbury River and Sydney. Peacock was a merchant and owner of ships: he owned the barque Sir William Wallace and other vessels and he traded in New Zealand where he bought wharves and land, he also had land on the Parramatta River and in the Hunter Valley. He was a licensee of the Dundee Arms in Gloucester Street, Sydney in 1840 and in 1842 he was appointed a director of the Union Assurance Co. He was an Alderman on City of Sydney Council from 1842 to 1843. In 1836 Peacock purchased four acres of the first sub-division of Balmain, opposite his Miller's Point wharf. By the 1840s it became evident he had spread his business empire too thin and by September 1843 he was facing insolvency. He sold off his 38 Balmain lots in 1841.(Sydney's Aldermen: http://www.sydneyaldermen.com.au/alderman/john-peacock/) Peacock Point, 1900 The 1888 map of Peacock Point shows that there had been land reclamation and a large amount of building construction by this time. The natural shore line is indicated on the map set well back from the reclaimed land edge in all but two locations, the largest of which is opposite William Street. By 1943 the whole foreshore of the site had all been reshaped and extended out into the bay. 1943 aerial photography clearly indicates that the maritime industrial use of the site continued well into the 20th century. Ships can be seen tied up to wharfs, one of which appears to have a crane for loading and unloading ships. The first Harbour Master was appointed to the Port of Sydney in 1811. Ninety years later the Sydney Harbour Trust took over the administration of the Port of Sydney. In 1936 the Maritime Services Board was formed to take control of all NSW ports with the exception of Port Kembla. The MSB was responsible for ports with jurisdiction over all navigable waters until it was dissolved in 1995 under the Port Corporatisation and Waterways Management Act 1995.http://www.maritime.nsw.gov.au/about/history.html The foreshore land at Weston Street and Peacock Point came under the management of the MSB and was used as a lumber yard until State Planning Authority planners Nigel Ashton and Lindsay Robertson acquired the site along with other harbour side sites for public open space. In 1968 Ashton engaged Bruce Mackenzie to undertake the landscape design which was constructed in two stages: Stage One in 1970 and Stage Two in 1981.Morris, Hericon and Spearitt 123 Iloura Reserve was enlarged in 2008 following Leichhardt Council's acquisition of the adjacent Fenwick & Co Boat Store site. =The Modern Movement in landscape design and its use at Iloura= The influence of the Modern Movement in landscape design in Australia was seen early in the 20th century in the works of Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin. At Castlecrag they demonstrated how buildings could be integrated with the natural environment. After World War II young Australian architects, like Richard Clough, Bruce Rickard, Peter Spooner and Allan Correy, returned from overseas with qualifications in landscape architecture, having been exposed to the Modern Movement. In the 1950s Rex Hazelwood advised Willoughby Municipal Council, planting spotted gums, turpentines and other native trees. Modern architect designed homes of the 1940s and 1950s were set in contrast to a natural setting or were integrated with a natural setting; both approaches relied upon the retention of native trees whilst building.Morris, Hericon and Spearitt 112 In the 1940s and 1950s notable Australian landscape designer Edna Walling had begun to regularly use Australian plants in her designs and advocated for them in her book The Australian Roadside (1952). The 1960s and the 1970s saw the rise of the Sydney School of architecture. This was an architecture practised within the Sydney region that expressed a natural affiliation with the Australian landscape; it integrated nature and architecture through spatial arrangements and choice of rustic simple materials and the application of craftsmanship. For example, Tocal College received both the Sulman and Blacket medals in 1965 and is credited with firmly establishing the Sydney School idiom: \\"Expressive structural use of robust and enduring materials seamlessly integrated within its landscape setting was a groundbreaking approach to institutional design.\\" Meanwhile, public attitudes to the urban environment began to change; by the 1960s and 1970s the environmental movement was on the rise. The publication of Rachel Carson's influential book Silent Spring in 1962, the rise of environmental organisation Greenpeace, reaction in Tasmania to the Lake Pedder and Franklin Dam projects and the rise of the Tasmanian Greens political party were all indicators of the greater public awareness of the natural environment. The use of local plant species in private gardens was being popularised by Thistle Harris in her book Australian Plants for the Garden (1953); Betty Maloney and Jean Walker's books Designing Bush Gardens (1966) and More About Bush Gardens (1967) and Ellis Stones in her book Australian Garden Design (1971). Likewise landscape practitioners like Bruce Mackenzie rejected the traditional design of urban parks which used introduced plants and formal spaces. Bruce Mackenzie describes this new way of thinking as a \\"respect for a spirit of place, the land, the genus loci.\\"Mackenzie: 15 Landscape architects began responding directly to the immediate site as well as having an appreciation of the broader landscape. The movement took on the name \\"Sydney Bush School\\". Mackenzie describes the impact and the essential elements of his Sydney Harbour Park designs: > \\"Sydney Harbour Parks turned out to be a somewhat ground breaking > realisation using local materials in a direct response to the immediate > environment and the elements of the harbour landscape. The ideas had been > developing in previous years with prior experience at Commodore Heights, Ku- > ring-gai Chase National Park, and then current involvement with Sydney > Kingsford Smith International Airport (not documented). > \\"Plant species, sandstone walls and cliff faces, wharf poles and jetties, > combined to be so evocative of the harbour's sense of place. Assembled > together in a way that had not been done before, recreating the charms of > the Sydney natural bush and sandstone, much-loved harbour side places and > childhood bush playgrounds. Another important aspect was that the flow of > landscape design responded to the informal thrusts of the existing site, to > its vague shapes and levels. > \\"Human patterns of usage - paths and walks, lookouts, picnic areas and car > parks touched a chord of recognition for professionals and public alike - > this is our landscape, this can be truer to our character than English parks > or French formality, and so many times more pleasurable.\\"Mackenzie: 38 Mackenzie coined a term for these park designs: \\"Alternative Parkland\\". Illoura was the first of these harbour side parks or \\"alternative parklands\\". Illoura Reserve has been described by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) as a seminal work and is described by the Australian Institute of Landscape Architecture as a critical contribution to Australian landscape architecture. Few people in Sydney at that time could identify local plant species and very few nurseries propagated them. The concept had never been tested in public parks, let alone sites which had disturbed and possibly contaminated soil conditions. Finn Thorvaldson, a young architect who assisted Mackenzie on the project, describes how they obtained Casuarina glauca (Swamp Oak) for the project: > \\"the only thing that would grow close to the water, because of the water > table, was Swamp Oak, Casuarina glauca, and of course no nursery had > Casuarina glauca, it didn't exist in their vocabulary, but Bruce did employ > somebody to collect the seed for that and actually grow it, so that was > grown in a nursery for a year and then planted out. So it was a slightly > different approach to going to buy plants off the shelf as you do now.\\" Over the years Mackenzie was the first to grow and test other local plant species that are commonly used today, including Lomandra longifolia, Westringia fruticosa and Cissus Antarctica.(Buchanan: 154-159) Mackenzie's design approach at Peacock Point represents an early attempt to balance ecological, social and aesthetic values, although he would not have described it in those terms. In ecological terms the planting of large numbers of local trees and shrubs in a thick layer of recycled mulch created a better microclimate in the park and reduced weeding, mowing and watering requirements. Apart from reinstating the aesthetic qualities of \\"the bush\\", the choice of local plant species was seen as a way to attract birds and insects. Many of the materials such as telegraph poles, wharf piles, dimensioned sandstone and mulch were recycled, made possible by the abundance of second-hand materials generated by the demolition of old buildings in Sydney during the 1960s and 1970s. Although terms like \\"sustainability\\" and \\"biodiversity\\" had not yet been coined, Peacock Point was sustainable in terms of construction methods, materials and maintenance.Buchanan: 154-159 In terms of community, Peacock Point was a clear statement of egalitarianism: it provided the residents of Balmain, an old and densely populated suburb, with a local park that was safe, accessible, inviting and comfortable, and one which provided a variety of spaces and range of activities for all ages. The park also gave unrestricted access to the harbour, allowing all members of the public, not just a privileged few, to enjoy the panoramic views of the city from the upper levels and to gain access to the waterfront at the lower levels. In terms of delight, Mackenzie created a \\"remarkable spatial quality due to the Harbour location, the sandstone cliffs and outcropping, and the complex sequence of spaces created by the use of built structures and planting\\". =Bruce Mackenzie and the Sydney Bush School= Bruce Mackenzie was born in 1932 and raised in a suburb where the bush was still a part of its framework. His first experience of being closely involved in the detail of \\"the bush\\" and the design of buildings was in the design of his own house with his wife Beverley on the rough bushland block at Dartford Road, Thornleigh. In 1960 he opened a landscape contracting business and began working with, leading modernist architects such as Harry Seidler, Sidney Ancher, Mortlock Murray & Woolley, Don Gazzard, Michael Dysart and Peter Johnson.Buchanan: 122 At this time he also developed a close relationship with Alistair Knox and Gordon Ford in Eltham, Melbourne, and through them he experienced the \\"bush garden\\" movement, originating in the work of Edna Walling and Ellis Stones. Mackenzie and Knox both shared a passion for the search for an \\"Australian Identity\\". In 1964 Mackenzie was the landscape architect for four Pettit and Sevitt houses in Richmond Avenue, St Ives. Here he minimised the building footprint so that the natural landscape features of the sites were kept intact and created a mature garden on open-day. In the same year he designed a lookout area at Commodore Heights, West Head with architect Russell Smith for Ku-Ring-Gai Chase National Park Trust, expressing a subtle adaptation of modernist principles to a living site, and was believed to be a prototype for Peacock Point, Balmain.Buchanan: 125 Between 1966 and 1971 Mackenzie worked on the campus of the Teachers College at Lindfield (later UTS Kuring-Gai); here he showed how cooperation between the architect and landscape architect with strict protection of the adjoining bushland and sympathetic planting of rooftop gardens could achieve an 'intimate fusion of landscape and noble architecture'Buchanan: 158 In 1967 he designed a significant garden on the roof space of the modernist Readers Digest Building by architect John James. Together with landscape architects, Bruce Rickard, Harry Howard, and Allen Correy, Bruce Mackenzie established what became known as the Sydney Bush School of landscape architecture. These four landscape architects designed and constructed public landscapes in Sydney which combined the \\"universal values of modernism and the specific qualities of the Australian landscape\\".Buchanan: 115 This approach was intimately tied to the Sydney School of architecture which was also establishing itself during this time. In many instance the architects and landscape architects worked closely together. An influential part in the development of the philosophy behind these design schools was the interaction between colleagues which took place at the offices at 7 Ridge Street, North Sydney. Bruce Mackenzie shared the Ridge Street offices with like minded architects, designers and artists such as Ian McKay, Harry Howard, Bruce Rickard and Harry Seidler and photographer David Moore. Designed as a purpose built space for a community of designers the building was an incubator for design ideas. Many of the landscape architects who went on to build the profession in Australia including; Helen Evans, Finn Thorvaldson, Catherin Bull, Nell Rickard, Victoria GroundsGrounds, Ian Olsen and Jane Coleman, worked with Mackenzie in this office.Buchanan: 149 In an interview with Barbara Buchanan in Bruce Mackenzie describes this time at Ridge Street: > \\"There was that sense of being part of a group of fellow travellers who > comprehended the same language and the same aspirations, the same > projections . . . And of course we are not just talking about bush, but we > are talking about design and planning, aesthetics and the circumstances and > the environment of society, of the community, of the way you lived and > worked and the way you played. It was that sort of association of > people.Mackenzie 2002 Interview p7\\".Buchanan: 150 Mackenzie's practical knowledge of the indigenous species of Sydney's bush and landscape construction made him a person of influence amongst his peers who often consulted him in these matters. Mackenzie in turn enjoyed the opportunity to have access to other designers and modernist ideology. The Sydney Bush School evolved through this cross fertilisation of ideas. His first major work whilst in the offices at 7 Ridge Street was Peacock Point. The Australian Institute of Landscape Architects (AILA) selected Sydney Harbour Parks Iloura Reserve and Yurulbin Park, Bruce Mackenzie and Associates, 1970-74 as one of the most significant projects between 1966 and 2000.Saniga, 2016, 27  Description  Illoura Reserve was constructed on an abandoned waterfront site known as Peacock Point that was reclaimed for public use by creation of a public park. The site had been stripped of all indigenous vegetation and used as an industrial site and then abandoned and fenced off. The lessee, Maritime Services Board, in 1970 instigated a clean-up and landscaping project before it handed the land over to the Council as a public reserve. A combination of responding to the site, identifying and relating to the environment and paying respect to the future visitors inspired the vision for the reserve at Peacock Point. Although its natural features had been removed the underlying sandstone survived: banks of fill were scraped back to reveal the rock features beneath. Stone steps and paths were incorporated into the levels emphasising the natural stone. A large viewing platform and stairs constructed from recycled wharf timbers connects the levels and celebrates the unique waterfront location and its views to the city. Construction materials consisted of materials recycled from the site and other demolition sites around Sydney. Using a language of sandstone retaining walls and flagging, massive timbers and native plants with large areas of mulch rather than grass, the park gave the harbour side Peacock Point location back to the community along with an entirely new experience of enjoying an urban bush environment. Mackenzie set about re-establishing an abstracted version of \\"bushland\\" using local plant species which linked the park to the other headlands in the harbour: > \\"There is a distinct ecologically-based progression from Casuarinas at the > water's edge, through leptospermum and westringias, to melaleucas and > eucalypts. The mature figs which edge both parks enhance the sense of > progression from the water's edge to the tall canopy of the woodland, and > define the beginning of the urban areas.\\" Mackenzie not only used the materials of Sydney Harbour such as sandstone blocks and wharf timbers but he created an urban park with a strong sense of its location on Sydney Harbour. A restoration plan for the reserve designed by Bruce Mackenzie and Associates was adopted by Leichhardt Municipal Council and implemented to ensure the original design intent was conserved and reinstated.  Heritage listing  Iloura Reserve is an outstanding twentieth century urban park that was an important forerunner to the implementation of the Sydney Bush School landscape design philosophy in public parks. Illoura Reserve is a seminal work of landscape architecture by one of the pioneers of the Sydney Bush School movement, Bruce Mackenzie, who created a landscape which was instrumental in changing public expectations in the design of public open space. Iloura Reserve was part of a movement towards environmentally conscious landscape design that was respectful of the special qualities existing in a place; retaining natural rock formations; reintroducing native vegetation; and interpreting the former industrial character of the place through the use of robust recycled timbers and sandstone blocks. The reserve was designed to provide an alternative to the ordered European based designs common in public parks at that time and provided the park user with a bush retreat within the city. The reserve is held in very high esteem by the landscape and architecture professions and by the local community of East Balmain as well as the wider community of Sydney. Iloura Reserve was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 29 November 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Illoura Reserve provides physical evidence of the 1970s practice of converting disused industrial waterfront sites into public parks. The reserve design inspired a change in public attitudes to public open space resulting in the desire for an alternative to the ordered neat environments common to public parks and heralded the beginning of the concept of ecologically sustainable design used in public projects. Illoura Reserve shows a high degree of creative or technical achievement for the 1970s. The design of the reserve was instrumental in changing the approach to design of harbourside parks and other public spaces. The Sydney Bush School approach to landscape design was indicative of the increased usage of indigenous plants and their introduction into mainstream gardens. Illoura Reserve influenced later generations of landscape designers in Australia. Illoura Reserve at Peacock Point is described by the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects to be a critical contribution to Australian landscape architecture. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The designer of Illoura Reserve, Bruce Mackenzie, is one of Australia's most influential landscape design practitioners and was a pioneer of the landscape movement known as the Sydney Bush School. The Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens (Aitken and Looker) describes Mackenzie as one of the foremost practitioners in the 1960s promoting an approach to landscape design which respected and harmonised with natural environments. The reserve is associated with Bruce Mackenzie and Associates and other design practices working at 7 Ridge Street, North Sydney who were pioneers of the Sydney Regional School of architecture and the Sydney Bush School of landscape architecture. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Illoura Reserve is a seminal work of Australian landscape architecture demonstrating the Sydney Bush School which inspired environmentally conscious landscape design that made use of indigenous flora and was respectful of the special qualities existing in a place such as natural rock formations. The reserve has the special quality of feeling \\"natural\\" whilst in reality being a highly designed landscape. Illoura Reserve has compositional qualities such as its layout, transition between levels, views, grouping of trees, texture of ground surfaces such as stone paths and mulched beds, exposed rock and stone walls and planting zones indicative of natural bush, which combine to delight the senses of the park user and provide an escape from the city environment. The original construction of the reserve demonstrated how indigenous plants could be propagated and planted to inspire a feeling of the original natural bush setting of a place, at a time when indigenous plants were largely unavailable from nurseries. Through the use of recycled building materials, such as wharf timbers and sandstone blocks, the reserve design also interprets the former industrial character of the site and its harbour side location. Located on a promontory in East Balmain in a central location on Sydney Harbour the reserve is a landmark green space. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The landscape and architecture professions have very high degree of attachment for the place. The community has demonstrated its affection and attachment to the reserve in the successful lobbying to have 6-8 Weston Street adjacent to Illoura Reserve purchased by Council for use as an extension to the reserve. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Illoura Reserve has rarity value as a Sydney Bush School foreshore park on Sydney Harbour. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Illoura Reserve is a fine example of the Sydney Bush School of landscape architectural design in New South Wales, which had a unique respect for the immediate environment and the characteristic spirit of the broad landscape beyond and found inspiration in the Hawkesbury Sandstone landscape type and its rock formations and flora predominant in the Sydney landscape. Illoura Reserve is important as the first example of the implementation of the Sydney Bush School landscape design philosophy in a public park on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour.

It is a circular flat mountain, rising above the seafloor to a depth of about , with a wide summit platform. The Mid-Pacific Mountains lie west of Hawaii and northeast of the Marshall Islands, but at the time of its formation the guyot was located in the Southern Hemisphere. The guyot was probably formed by a hotspot in today's French Polynesia before plate tectonics shifted it to its present-day location. The Easter, Marquesas, Pitcairn and Society hotspots, among others, may have been involved in the formation of Resolution Guyot. Volcanic activity has been dated to have occurred 107‚Äì129 million years ago and formed a volcanic island that was subsequently flattened by erosion. Carbonate deposition commenced, forming an atoll-like structure and a carbonate platform. The platform emerged above sea level at some time between the Albian and Turonian ages before eventually drowning for reasons unknown between the Albian and the Maastrichtian. Thermal subsidence lowered the drowned seamount to its present depth. After a hiatus, sedimentation commenced on the seamount and led to the deposition of manganese crusts and pelagic sediments, some of which were later modified by phosphate.  Name and research history  Resolution Guyot was informally known as Huevo Guyot before it was renamed after the drilling ship JOIDES Resolution during Leg 143 of the Ocean Drilling Program in 1992. During that Leg, JOIDES Resolution took drill cores from Resolution Guyot called 866A, 867A and 867B; 866A was drilled on its summit, 867B (and the unsuccessful drilling attempt 867A) on its platform margin, and 868A on a terrace outside of the platform.  Geography and geology  = Local setting = Resolution Guyot is part of the western Mid-Pacific Mountains, located west of Hawaii, north-northeast of the Marshall Islands. Unlike conventional Pacific Ocean island chains, the Mid-Pacific Mountains are a group of oceanic plateaus with guyots (also known as tablemounts)) that become progressively younger towards the east. Other guyots in the Mid-Pacific Mountains are Sio South, Darwin, Thomas, Heezen, Allen, Caprina, Jacqueline and Allison. The seamount is about high and rises from a raised seafloor to a depth of about . At a depth of it is capped off by a wide rather flat and roughly circular summit platform with a high rim and a moat inside of this rim. At the margin of the platform, structures interpreted as sea cliffs or wave cut terraces have been found; at one site there is a terrace about wide, surmounted by a high cliff. Pinnacles and depressions dot the surface platform. The surface of the platform consists of limestone that is partially covered by pelagic sediments; underwater cameras have shown the presence of rock slabs covered by ferromanganese crusts. The guyot rises from a seafloor of Jurassic age (201.3 ¬± 0.2 ‚Äì ca. 145 million years ago) that might be as much as 154 million years old. Terrestrial organic material on the seafloor around Resolution Guyot originated from when it was still an island, and carbonate sediments swept away from the guyot ended up on the surrounding seafloor. = Regional setting = alt=Diagram of how an active volcano is accompanied by decaying inactive volcanoes that were formerly located on the hotspot but have been moved away The Pacific Ocean seafloor contains many guyots formed during the Mesozoic age (251.902 ¬± 0.3 ‚Äì 66 million years ago) in unusually shallow seas. These submarine mountains are characterized by a flat top and usually the presence of carbonate platforms that rose above the sea surface during the middle Cretaceous (ca. 145 ‚Äì 66 million years ago). While there are some differences to present-day reef systems, many of these seamounts were formerly atolls, which still exist. These structures formed as volcanoes in the Mesozoic ocean. Fringing reefs may have developed on the volcanoes, which then became barrier reefs as the volcano subsided and turned into an atoll, and which surround a lagoon or a tidal flat. The crust underneath these seamounts tends to subside as it cools, and thus the islands and seamounts sink. Continued subsidence balanced by upward growth of the reefs led to the formation of thick carbonate platforms. Sometimes volcanic activity continued even after the formation of the atoll or atoll-like structure, and during episodes where the platforms rose above sea level erosional features such as channels and blue holes developed. The formation of many seamounts has been explained by the hotspot theory, which suggests that the chains of volcanoes become progressively older along the length of the chain, with an erupting volcano only at one end of the system. Resolution lies on a volcano on the lithosphere heated from below; as the plate shifts it is moved away from the heat source and volcanic activity ceases, producing a chain of volcanoes that get progressively older away from those currently active. Potential hotspots involved in the formation of Resolution Guyot are the Easter, Marquesas, Society and in some plate reconstructions the Pitcairn hotspots although not all point at a presently active hotspot. More than one hotspot may have influenced the growth of Resolution Guyot, and it and Allison Guyot may have been formed by the same hotspot(s). The entire Mid-Pacific Mountains may be the product of such a hotspot. = Composition = Rocks found at Resolution Guyot include basalt of the volcano and carbonates deposited in shallow-water conditions on the volcano. Minerals found in the basalt are alkali feldspar, clinopyroxene feldspar, ilmenite, magnetite, olivine, plagioclase, spinel and titanomagnetite; the olivine, plagioclase and pyroxenes form phenocrysts. Alteration has produced analcime, ankerite, calcite, clay, hematite, iddingsite, pyrite, quartz, saponite, serpentine and zeolite. The basalts represent an alkaline intraplate suite, earlier trachybasalts containing biotite have been recovered as well. The carbonates occur in the form of boundstone, carbonate hardgrounds, floatstone, grainstone, grapestone, oncoids, ooliths, packstone, peloids, rudstones, spherulites, and wackestones. Alteration has formed calcite, dolomite, quartz through silicification and vugs. Dolomite alteration is particularly widespread in modern atolls and several processes have been invoked to explain it, such as geothermally driven convection of seawater. Dissolved fossils and traces of animal burrows are found in some rock sequences with bioturbation traces widespread. Barite needles, calcretes, cementation forms that developed under the influence of freshwater, desiccation cracks and ferromanganese occurrences as dendrites have also been found. Organic materials found in rock samples from Resolution Guyot appear to be mainly of marine origin. Some of the organic matter comes from microbial mats and vegetated islands, including wood and plant remains. Clays found on Resolution Guyot are characterized as chlorite, glauconite, hydromica, illite, kaolinite, saponite and smectite. Claystones have also been found. Most clays have been found in the lower carbonate sequence, while the upper parts mostly lack clay deposits. Some of the clays may originate from younger volcanoes east of Resolution Guyot. Apatite formed through phosphate modification of exposed rocks underwater. Other minerals include anhydrite, celestite, goethite, gypsum, limonite and pyrite which is also present in the carbonates. Finally, mudstones have been found.  Geologic history  Although radiometric dating has been carried out on volcanic rocks from Resolution Guyot, the basalts are heavily altered and the dates are thus uncertain. Potassium-argon dating yields ages of 107‚Äì125 million years ago while argon-argon dating indicates ages of 120‚Äì129 million years ago. Magnetization data indicate that it was formed in the Southern Hemisphere. = Volcanic phase = Eruptions in the area built a pile of volcanic rocks, including stacks of lava flows, each of which is about thick, but there are also breccias, intrusions and sills. The lava flows appear to have been formed years apart from each other. Resolution Guyot was also hydrothermally active. This volcanic activity over 1‚Äì2 million years generated a volcanic island. Volcanic activity took place in a tropical or subtropical environment and between eruptions weathering, soil formation and potentially mass wasting generated layers of clay, rock debris and alteration products such as laterite. Erosion eventually flattened the volcanic island to form a platform. = Platform carbonates and reefs = Between the Hauterivian (ca. 132.9 ‚Äì ca. 129.4 million years ago) and Albian (ca. 113 ‚Äì 100.5 million years ago), about of carbonate was deposited on the volcanic structure, eventually completely burying it during the Albian. About 14 individual sequences of carbonates have been identified in drill cores. The carbonate sedimentation probably began in the form of shoals surrounding a volcanic island and lasted for about 35 million years, accompanied by perhaps of subsidence. It is likely that the present-day carbonate platform contains only a fraction of the originally deposited carbonate, most of the carbonate having disappeared. During this time, Resolution Guyot underwent little latitudinal plate motion; from the magnetization it appears that it was stably located at about 13¬∞ southern latitude between the Hauterivian and Aptian. Its carbonate platform cannot be reconstructed as only small parts have been studied, but some conclusions can be made. The Resolution platform was surrounded by barrier islands but featured only a few reefs; unlike present-day atolls which were rimmed by reefs Cretaceous platforms were rimmed by sand shoals and on Resolution Guyot drill cores into the rim have only found sediment accumulations and no reefs. Analysis of the carbonate layers has identified that several environments existed on the platform, including swash beaches, lagoons, marshes, mudflats, sabkhas, sand bars and washover fans from storms; at times there were also open-marine conditions. Some environments on Resolution Guyot were hypersaline at times, probably implying that they had only limited water exchange with the surrounding ocean. Islands formed from sand bars, resembling those of the Bahama Banks. Records from Hole 866A indicate that settings at a given site were not stable over longer time periods. The Cretaceous Apulian Carbonate Platform in Italy and the Urgonian Formation in France have been compared to the Resolution Guyot carbonates. All these platforms were located in Tethyan seas and several formations in these three carbonate environments are correlated; for example, the fauna identified on Resolution Guyot resembles that from other Northern Hemisphere platforms. Analogies also exist to platforms in Venezuela.

The platform was exposed to southeasterly trade winds which left its northern side sheltered from waves, except from storm-generated ones. These waves, wind and tidal currents acted to shift sediments around on the platform. Storms formed beaches on the platform, although the interior parts of the platform were effectively protected by the surrounding shoals from storm influence. Some patterns in the sedimentation indicate a seasonal climate. When the climate was arid, gypsum deposition took place. Through the history of the platform sea level variations led to changes in the accumulating carbonate sediments, with typical facies and sequences forming in the carbonate layers. The Selli event, an oceanic anoxic event, is recorded at Resolution Guyot as is the Faraoni event. The Selli event left a black shale layer and may have caused a temporary interruption in carbonate accumulation before the platform recovered. During the Albian-Aptian some carbonates became dolomites. Life on Resolution Guyot included algae - both green and red algae -, bivalves including rudists, bryozoans, corals, echinoderms, echinoids, foraminifers, gastropods, ostracods, oysters, serpulid worms, sponges and stromatolithes. Fossils of animals have been found in the drill cores. Rudists and sponges have been identified as bioherm builders; rudist families found on Resolution include caprinidae of the genus Caprina, coalcomaninae, monopleuridae and requieniidae. Well developed microbial mats grew in some places. Plant remnants have been found in the carbonate sediments, probably reflecting the existence of vegetation-covered islands on the platform. Vegetation probably occurred in swamps and marshes as well. = Uplift and karstification = During the Albian to Turonian (93.9 ‚Äì 89.8 ¬± 0.3 million years ago), the carbonate platform rose above the sea by about -. This uplift episode at Resolution Guyot is part of an episode of more general tectonic changes in the Pacific Ocean, with a general uplift of the ocean floor and tectonic stress changes at the ocean margins. This tectonic event has been explained by a major change in mantle convection in the middle Cretaceous pushing the ocean floor upward and sideward. When Resolution Guyot rose above sea level, karst processes began to impact the platform. The platform became irregular and part of it was eroded away; carbonate pinnacles, cavities, caverns containing speleothems and sinkholes formed. At this stage, Resolution Guyot would have resembled a makatea island. This karstic episode did not last for long, perhaps several hundred thousand years, but structures left by the karstic phase such as sinkholes and carbonate pinnacles can still be seen on the surface platform of Resolution Guyot. During periods of emergence, freshwater flowed through and modified the carbonates. = Drowning and post-drowning evolution = Resolution Guyot drowned either about 99 ¬± 2 million years ago or during the Maastrichtian (72.1 ¬± 0.2 to 66 million years ago), although a hiatus in shallow carbonate deposition appears to date back to the Albian that may reflect a long pause in deposition or increased erosion. The end Albian period was characterized by widespread cessation of carbonate sedimentation across the western Pacific. It is possible that carbonate sedimentation later continued until Campanian (83.6 ¬± 0.2 ‚Äì 72.1 ¬± 0.2 million years ago)-Maastrichtian times. The platform was certainly submerged by Pliocene (5.333 ‚Äì 2.58 million years ago) times. Other carbonate platforms in the Pacific drowned especially at the end of the Albian, for unknown reasons; among the proposed mechanisms are overly nutrient rich or turbid waters, the disappearance of reef-forming species and a subsequent failure of them to return, and overly fast sea level rise. Resolution Guyot was never far enough south to end up beyond the Darwin point at which carbonate deposition stops. The Resolution Guyot platform rose above sea level before the drowning, and there is no indication that carbonate deposition recommenced when the platform subsided; similarly other Mid-Pacific Mountains emerged before drowning. There is disagreement about whether Resolution Guyot was close enough to the equator and nutrient rich equatorial waters to drown at the time when carbonate sedimentation ceased. After the drowning, crusts formed by ferromanganese and by phosphate-modified rocks developed on exposed surfaces at Resolution Guyot. Several different layers of phosphate modification have been observed during the Albian alone and this process may have begun when the platform was still active; water within the rocks may have triggered phosphatization at this stage. The ferromanganese deposition probably only began in the Turonian- Maastrichtian, when the seamount had subsided to a sufficient depth. Manganese-encrusted Cretaceous limestones have been found within the pelagic sediments. As at other guyots in the Pacific Ocean pelagic sedimentation commenced later; the foraminifera fossils indicate an age of Maastrichtian to Pliocene for such sediments. These sediments reach thicknesses of in Hole 866B and consist of a Quaternary (last 2.58 million years), a thin early Pleistocene (2.58 ‚Äì 0.0117 million years ago) and a thick Pliocene layer. Some of the sediments take the form of pelagic limestones. In Paleogene (66 to 23.03 million years ago) sediments ostracods have been found. Carbonates were dissolved and replaced by dolomite already during the Aptian and Albian. Around 24 million years ago at the Paleogene-Neogene (23.02 ‚Äì 2.58 million years ago) boundary, a second pulse of dolomite formation took place; perhaps sea level changes associated with global climate change triggered this second pulse. The formation of the dolomites was probably aided by the fact that seawater can percolate through Resolution Guyot.

It was built from 1875 to 1885. It is also known as Fenwick & Co. Building and Bell's Store. The property is owned by the Inner West Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 9 June 2000.  History  The site of 2-8 Weston Street was part of the land granted to William Balmain in 1800. Prior to returning to England, Balmain transferred the land to John Gilchrist. Gilchrist subsequently subdivided the land and in 1836 auctioneer George William Paul purchased Lot 4 and Lot 6. Paul subdivided his purchase and the future site of Fenwick's business became Lots 3 and 4. These were sold to Harry Lambert Brabagan in July 1840. The following month Brabagan resold this land to the shipwright John Bell. Soon after purchasing the land John Bell built a residence on the corner of Darling and Weston Streets.Weston Street was named in 1841 In 1844 Bell leased his home to William Walker, who opened it as the Dolphin Hotel (later the Shipwright's Arms Hotel, one of the first licensed hotels in Balmain. John Bell was amongst the more notable boat builders who established themselves in Balmain from the 1830s onwards. After purchase of Brabagan's Lots he proceeded to build a stone wharf and open a shipwright's yard on the site, as well as the residence mentioned above. However, during Bell's ownership the shipyards were not a large operation as he was also running the hotel. (More research would be required to establish the extent of the Bell's boatbuilding activities on the site from 1840 until 1883.) Fenwick purchased Bell's shipyard in 1883. The property included a wharf, store and the Shipwright's Arms Hotel. Close examination of the store fabric established that it was most likely to have been built between 1875 and 1885 and probably by Fenwick and Co. after they occupied the site.Godden Mackay Logan, 1999 John Fenwick and his brother Thomas established the firm J Fenwick and Co., a tug boat company, on another site in Balmain, in 1870. The company was to become on of the largest owners of tug boats in Sydney and Newcastle. The company was split several years after foundation, so that John Fenwick concentrated on Sydney whilst Thomas Fenwick handled the coastal river trade from Ballina. Their first tug was the \\"J and T Fenwick\\" and registered in January 1871. The establishment of Fenwick's tug boat company in Balmain is connected with the expansion of privately owned wharfage for foreign trade westwards from Sydney Cove into Walsh Bay and the north-eastern part of Darling Harbour from onwards. Three of the early Fenwick tugs were the Newborough (1888), Loveset (1892) and Hero (1892), built by J. P. Rennoldsons of South Shields, England. After the death of John Fenwick in 1901 his sons carried on the business. At the time of writing of the 1993 Conservation Plan, it \\"was the only traditional waterfront industry still in operation in this part of Balmain.\\" At that time the site was owned by Brambles Group who had purchased the site in 1986. A number of physical changes occurred on the site during the twentieth century. In 1950 the Shipwrights Arms was sold to Miller's brewery by Fenwick's company (who had purchased it as part of their original acquisition in 1883). The boat store was heavily modified in 1963 by the removal of much of its eastern gable, the lowering of its roof and the modification of its setting which included raising ground levels on the southern and western sides. At that time, an administration building was erected on the adjacent site.Godden Mackay Logan 1998 In 1993, Brambles submitted a development application for the development of the existing two-storey office building and the erection of eight dwellings. It was the subject of community concern, and was refused by Leichhardt Council on 28 September 1993. Numerous subsequent applications were made by successive owners (Brambles, RoseCorp and Bezzina) and objections lodged by individuals or groups, public meetings held, petitions submitted and Land and Environment Court action taken. Many residents appeared resigned to accepting the plans of the final developer, Bezzina, when in late 2002 a community group, \\"Reclaim Bells Foreshore\\" was formed to attempt to have it acquired as open space for future generations. It was supported by the then- mayor of Leichhardt, Maire Sheehan. A large public meeting in Iloura Reserve on 27 July 2003 boosted the campaign, and on 26 August 2003 Leichhardt Council decided to compulsorily acquire the site. Following the acquisition, the 1963 administration building was demolished in 2008 to extend the open space of Iloura Reserve and realise part of a plan for a continuous foreshore park. The heritage building underwent a $2 million restoration in 2012. In 2015, Leichhardt Council passed a development application for an 80-seat restaurant, with a 2.5m hole to be cut in the building's side and a new large concrete balcony built to meet accessibility requirements. This was also met with community opposition, with opponents making their own proposal involving a smaller cafe, gallery and alternative disability access. The redevelopment was reportedly due to be completed in mid-2018.  Description  Relic anchor The J. Fenwick & Co.

The building is set against the escarpment of the foreshore with the ground level along the west facade above the window sill height for the first floor. The ground then slopes down along the southern side to a flat waterfront terrace level which fronts the eastern and northern facades of the building. The building therefore presents only two full facades, the east and the north, with only parts of the first floor visible on the south and west sides. The eastern facade faces the waterfront and contains the finest detailing to the stonework, which is formed of regular coursed sandstone with a rusticated finish. Features include a smoothly finished carved sandstone bracket at either edge of the wall on the upper level towards the parapet and a splayed stone coping which extends along this parapet that is ended by much larger coping elements. The east facade has been altered with a horizontal concrete beam placed as a lintel across the top of the upper door. Above this lintel, the stonework has been clearly reconstructed. Two fluorescent lights extend out from near the top of the wall to the north and south, A slate damp course exists at the base of the facade. On both levels of the east facade, there are timber framed double goods doors in the centre with a double-hung four pane sash window either side. Both windows on the lower level are protected by galvanised steel sheeting and steel gratings. The central door opening is continuous between the floors and there is a vertically barred ventilation opening across the top of the lower door. A sandstone retaining wall slopes away from the building to the south. The north facade has dressed and coursed sandstone as lintels, sills and quoins around the window openings and at the building's corners, with roughly squared sandstone rubble infill. All lintels and sills consist of a single large horizontal block of sandstone with smooth margins and a rusticated finish. There are three double-hung sash windows on each level. All windows on the ground floor level have a steel grating on their exterior for protection. A sandstone retaining wall extends out from the building towards the west, and is topped by a steel hand rail. On the south facade, only the upper level is visible, with the ground sloping up towards the west. The same random coursed, roughly squared sandstone blockwork has been used as for the north facade. Running along the length of the south facade is a timber fascia piece above which sites the galvanised sheet roofing and associated rainwater goods. The roofing butts against the parapet on the east elevation. Just off centre to the west is a smaller version of the timber-framed double goods doors. It has a stone sill and shows evidence of recent work to the mortar in the surrounding blockwork. The west facade is only visible from roughly halfway up the original window openings around which light wells have been constructed. The facade exhibits the same sandstone blockwork as the north and south walls with similar treatments around the windows. The area under the gabled roof end is covered with vertical galvanised sheeting. Downpipes exist at north ends of the wall.Godden Mackay Logan, Heritage Impact Statement, 1999  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The site of the J. Fenwick & Co. Boat Store is significant because of its continuous association with the growth and development of maritime industries in Balmain, from the earliest days of Balmain's subdivision. This is due to the formation and operation of Bell's Shipyard and the subsequent operations of J. Fenwick & Co. The site has important links with the development of the port of Sydney because of its association with the use of tug boats as an integral part of shipping operations.Howard, 1993 The stone store is a rare surviving built element of Balmain's former links with the maritime service industries of Sydney Harbour, and as such contributes to the cultural significance of the Harbour. The stone store physically demonstrates the role of Balmain in the working of Sydney Harbour until recent times (Heritage Office). The stone store is an early surviving record of maritime industry, not only in Balmain and Sydney, but in New South Wales; and for its long association with the Fenwick Tug Boat Company, which was the earliest and pre-eminent tugboat operator on Sydney Harbour.McDonald, 1999 Fenwick & Co Boat Store was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 9 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site has historic significance as a relatively intact unit of early subdivisions in Balmain. It has direct links with John Bell, an important shipwright and personality in the early days of Balmain's settlement. The continued presence of J. Fenwick & Co. Pty Ltd on this site is the only traditional waterfront industry which still operates in this part of Balmain. The site has important associations with the use of tug boats as a crucial part of maritime activity on Sydney Harbour, from their early inception into New South Wales until the present day.Howard 1993 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The J. Fenwick & Co. Boat Store is one of a group of nineteenth century sandstone buildings within the immediate vicinity of the site. These include the former Shipwrights Arms and the Waterman's Cottage at the corner of Darling and Weston Streets. The J. Fenwick & Co. Boat Store demonstrates characteristics found in ancillary waterfront buildings of the nineteenth century. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Fenwick & Co. site has social significance as it reflects the growth of Sydney and Balmain from the 1840s. It reflects the development of port facilities within the City of Sydney and the growth of local port infrastructure and support industry at Balmain.

The variation in composition within the Earth's crust is much greater than that of other terrestrial planets. Mars, Venus, Mercury and other planetary bodies have relatively quasi-uniform crusts unlike that of the Earth which contains both oceanic and continental plates. This unique property reflects the complex series of crustal processes that have taken place throughout the planet's history, including the ongoing process of plate tectonics. The proposed mechanisms regarding Earth's crustal evolution take a theory-orientated approach. Fragmentary geologic evidence and observations provide the basis for hypothetical solutions to problems relating to the early Earth system. Therefore, a combination of these theories creates both a framework of current understanding and also a platform for future study.  Early crust  = Mechanisms of early crust formation = The early Earth was entirely molten. This was due to high temperatures created and maintained by the following processes: * Compression of the early atmosphere * Rapid axial rotation * Regular impacts with neighbouring planetesimals. adiabat represents a change of temperature with pressure if no heat was lost through convection. Early mantle adiabats show crystallisation took place from the base; above approximately 25 GPa (deep mantle) perovskites would begin to crystallise, below 25 GPa (upper mantle) olivine would crystallise. The mantle remained hotter than modern day temperatures throughout the Archean. Over time the Earth began to cool as planetary accretion slowed and heat stored within the magma ocean was lost to space through radiation. A theory for the initiation of magma solidification states that once cool enough, the cooler base of the magma ocean would begin to crystallise first. This is because pressure of 25 GPa at the surface cause the solidus to lower. The formation of a thin 'chill- crust' at the extreme surface would provide thermal insulation to the shallow sub surface, keeping it warm enough to maintain the mechanism of crystallisation from the deep magma ocean. The composition of the crystals produced during the crystallisation of the magma ocean varied with depth. Experiments involving the melting of peridotite magma show that deep in the ocean (>‚âà700 m), the main mineral present would be Mg-perovskite, whereas olivine would dominate in the shallower areas along with its high pressure polymorphs e.g. garnet and majorite. A contributing theory to the formation of the first continental crust is through intrusive plutonic volcanism. The product of these eruptions formed a hot, thick lithosphere which underwent regular cycling with the mantle. The heat released by this form of volcanism, as well as assisting mantle convection, increased the geothermal gradient of the early crust.  Crustal dichotomy  The crustal dichotomy is the distinct contrast in composition and nature of the oceanic and continental plates, which together form the overall crust. = Timing = Oceanic and continental crusts are, at the present day, produced and maintained through plate tectonic processes. However, the same mechanisms are unlikely to have produced the crustal dichotomy of the early lithosphere. This is thought to be true on the basis that sections of the thin, low density continental lithosphere thought to have originally covered the planet could not have been subducted under each other. Consequently, a proposed relative timing for crustal dichotomy has been put forward stating that the dichotomy began before the commencement of global plate tectonics. This is so a difference in crustal density could be established to facilitate plate subduction. = Formation = 317x317px  Impact cratering  Large and numerous impact craters can be recognised on planetary bodies across the Solar System. These craters are thought to date back to a period where there was an increased frequency and intensity of asteroid impacts with terrestrial planets, known as the Late Heavy Bombardment, which terminated approximately 4 billion years ago. This proposal goes on to claim the Earth would have also sustained the same relative intensity of cratering as other planetesimals in the Solar System. It is therefore only due to Earth's high erosional rates and constant plate tectonics that the craters are not visible today. By scaling up the number and size of impact craters seen on the Moon to fit the size of Earth, it is predicted that at least 50% of the Earth's initial crust was covered in impact basins. This estimate provides a lower limit of the effect impact cratering had on the Earth's surface. =Effects= The main effects of impact cratering on the early lithosphere were: * Formation of large craters. Isostatic rebound would adjust the depth of the craters making them relatively shallow in comparison to their diameter; some reaching 4 km deep and 1000 km in diameter. *Topographic division between the low-lying impact basins and the now elevated surface. * Release in pressure at the surface from the removal of overburden. This produced a greater increase in temperature with depth below the surface. Increased surface temperatures caused the partial melting of mantle which erupted and deposited within the surface basins. The pyrolite mantle would have produced basaltic partial melts, compositionally contrasting to the existing sialic crust. The magnitude of these impacts is interpreted, with a high level of uncertainty, to have converted roughly half of the 'continental' crust into terrestrial maria, thereby providing a method for the formation of crustal dichotomy, as seen today.  Types of crust  = Primordial crust = The initial crystallisation of minerals from the magma ocean formed the primordial crust. A potential explanation of this process states the resultant solidification of the mantle edge took place approximately 4.43 Ga. This would subsequently produce continents composed of komatiite, an ultramafic rock rich in magnesium with a high melting point and low dynamic viscosity. Another line of research follows up on this, proposing that differences in the densities of newly formed crystals caused separation of crustal rocks; upper crust largely composed of fractionated gabbros and lower crust composed of anorthosites. The overall result of initial crystallisation formed a primordial crust roughly 60 km in depth. The lack of certainty regarding the formation of primordial crust is due to there being no remaining present day examples. This is due to Earth's high erosional rates and the subduction and subsequent destruction of tectonic plates throughout its 4.5 Ga history. Furthermore, during its existence the primordial crust is thought to have been regularly broken and re-formed by impacts involving other planetesimals. This continued for several hundred million years after accretion, which concluded approximately 4.4 Ga. The outcome of this would be the constant alteration in the composition of the primordial crust, increasing the difficulty in determining its nature. = Secondary crust = Recycling of existing primordial crust contributes to the production of secondary crust. Partial melting of the existing crust increases the mafic content of the melt producing basaltic secondary crust. A further method of formation due to the decay of radioactive elements within the Earth releasing heat energy and eventually causing the partial melting of upper mantle, also producing basaltic lavas. As a result, most secondary crust on Earth is formed at mid ocean ridges forming the oceanic crust. = Tertiary crust = The present day continental crust is an example of a tertiary crust. Tertiary crust is the most differentiated type of crust and so has a composition vastly different to that of the bulk Earth. The tertiary crust contains over 20% of the abundance of incompatible elements, which are elements with a size or charge that prevent them from being included in mineral structure. This a result of its generation from the subduction and partial melting of secondary crust where it undergoes further fractional crystallisation. Two stages of evolution produce an increased proportion of incompatible elements.  Initiation of plate tectonics  A schematic evolutionary diagram showing the impact of a mantle plume on the early lithosphere (dark blue) and surface proto-crust (brown). This initiated subduction and subsequent global plate tectonics within a previously unseparated lithosphere that had no lateral surface movement.Modified from = Plume induced subduction = The formation and development of plumes in the early mantle contributed to triggering the lateral movement of crust across the Earth's surface. The effect of upwelling mantle plumes on the lithosphere can be seen today through local depressions around hotspots such as Hawaii. The scale of this impact is much less than that exhibited in the Archean eon where mantle temperatures were much greater. Localised areas of hot mantle rose to the surface through a central plume wedge, weakening the damaged and already thin lithosphere. Once the plume head breaks the surface, crust either side of the head is forced downwards through the conservation of mass, initiating subduction. Numerical modelling shows only strongly energetic plumes are capable of weakening the lithosphere enough to rupture it, such plumes would have been present in the hot Archean mantle. Pre-tectonic subduction can also be inferred from the internal volcanism on Venus. Artemis Corona is a large plume formed by the upwelling of mantle derived magma and is on a scale potentially comparable to that in the Archean mantle. Models using its known characteristics showed that continued magmatism from conductive heat through the plume caused gravitational collapse. The weight of collapse caused the spreading of the surrounding crust outwards and subsequent subduction around the margins. The anhydrous nature of the crust on Venus prevents it from sliding past each other, whereas through the study of oxygen isotopes, the presence of water on Earth can be confirmed from 4.3 Ga. Thus, this model helps provide a mechanism for how plate tectonics could have been triggered on Earth, although it does not demonstrate that subduction was initiated at the earliest confirmed presence of water on Earth. Based on these models, the onset of subduction and plate tectonics is dated at 3.6 Ga. = Late Heavy Bombardment = Impact cratering also had consequences for both the development of plume-induced subduction and the establishment of global plate tectonics. The steepening of geothermal gradients could have directly enhanced convective mantle transport which now beneath an increasingly fractured lithosphere could have created stresses great enough to cause rifting and the separation of crust into plates.  Crustal growth rates  Ga represents the onset of subduction and plate tectonics. Modified from = Lithological dating = Crustal growth rates can be used to calculate estimates for the age of the continental crust. This can be done through analysis of igneous rocks with the same isotopic composition as initial mantle rock. These igneous rocks are dated and assumed to be direct evidence of new continental crust formation. The resulting ages of isotopically juvenile igneous rocks give distinct peaks, representing an increased proportion of igneous rock and therefore increased crust growth, at 2.7, 1.9 and 1.2 Ga. The validity of these results is questioned as the peaks could represent periods of preservation rather than increased continental crust generation. This is reinforced by the fact that such peaks are not observed in recent geologic time where it is given that magmatism resulting from the plate subduction has strongly contributed to producing new crust. Crustal growth rates from igneous rocks can be compared to the rates generated from radiogenic isotope ratios in sedimentary rocks. Projections of growth rates using these techniques does not produce staggered peaks, instead smooth shallow curves presenting a more constant rate of crustal growth. Although representative of large periods of time, limitations are found where samples do not solely represent magmatic production events. Instead samples include the mixing of sediments which produces a mix of original and altered isotope ratios. = Zircon dating = Zircon minerals can be both detrital grains from sedimentary rocks and crystals in igneous rocks. Therefore, a combination of zircon forms can provide a more accurate estimate of crustal growth rates. Further to this, zircon minerals can be subject to Hf and O isotope ratio analysis. This is important as Hf isotopes indicate whether a rock originates from the mantle or an existing rock. High Œ¥18O values of zircons represent rock recycled at the Earth's surface and thus potentially producing mixed samples. The outcome of this combined analysis is valid zircons showing periods of increased crustal generation at 1.9 and 3.3 Ga, the latter of which representing the time period following the commencement of global plate tectonics.

Despite very little schooling, she taught herself to read and write, becoming a schoolteacher herself. Biography Born on 4 June 1806 in the Scottish borders, Janet Bathgate was the daughter of the farm labourer John Greenfield and his wife Tibbie. She only attended school for very short periods but learnt to read and write at home, studying her father's letters. As a result of her parents' poverty, she was sent into service when she was only eight years old. She later became a nursemaid for the children of Robert and Susun ScottMoncrieff. She left service when she married as a young adult but on her husband's premature death, in 1836 she opened a small school for infants in Dalkeith, offering reading lessons to local children. In 1838, she ran a school for children in Kirkhill. She later married Robert Bathgate who worked near Glasgow for a firm of cloth merchants. After he opened his own drapery and millinery business in Galashiels, Janet Bathgate helped him until he died in 1863. She then moved to Peebles where she held religious classes for the local women in the house she bought. In later life she wrote Aunt Janet's Legacy to Her Nieces which she was persuaded to publish in 1894. The book was well received, attracting the interest of celebrities such as Lord Francis Napier and William Gladstone who found it \\"an edifying work, eminently well written, and full of interest.\\" More recently, the book has been the subject of analyses of the behaviour of working-class women in the 19th century, including Melisa Klimaszeski's Writing the Victorian Home, A Nursemaid's Perspective on Maternity and Empire. As she grew older, Bathgate suffered from failing eyesight. Thanks to the encouragement of her nephew James K. Rae, before she died she nevertheless dictated a tale he had remembered from his childhood. Titled Aunt Nell's Story, or a Feast at Habakkuk's Spring (an incident of the last century), it was published by the Edinburgh Religious Tract and Book Society. Janet Bathgate died in 1898, aged 94.

Faik Konica wrote little in the way of literature, but as a stylist, critic, publicist and political figure he had a tremendous impact on Albanian writing and on Albanian culture at the time.  Biography  Faik was born on March 15, 1875 as a son of Shahin and Lalia Zenelbej in the town of Koni√ße (modern Konitsa), Janina Vilayet, Ottoman Empire, now in northern Greece, not far from the present Albanian border. He had three brothers: Mehmed, Rustem and Hilmi. After elementary schooling in Turkish in his native town, he studied at the Xavierian Shkod√´r Jesuit College in Shkodra which offered him not only some instruction in Albania but also an initial contact with central European culture and Western ideas. From there, he continued his schooling at the eminent French-language Imperial Galatasaray High School in Istanbul. During his youth, Konica cultivated his skills in the Albanian language and amassed a small library of books by foreign Albanologists. In 1890, at the age of fifteen, he was sent to study in France where he spent the next seven years. After initial education at secondary schools in Lisieux (1890) and Carcassonne (1892), he registered at the University of Dijon, from which he graduated in 1895 in Romance languages and philology. After graduation, he moved to Paris for two years where he studied Medieval French literature, Latin and Greek at the famous Coll√®ge de France. He finished his studies at the prestigious Harvard University in the United States, although little is known of this period of his life. As a result of his highly varied educational background, he was able to speak and write Albanian, Greek, Italian, French, German, English and Turkish fluently. In 1895, Konica converted from Islam to Roman Catholicism, and changed his name from Faik to Dominik, signing for many years as Faik Dominik Konica.Thanas L. Gjika, \\"Konica hapi epok√´n e rikrishterizimit t√´ shqiptar√´ve\\" However, in 1897 he would say \\"All religions make me vomit\\" and he later was described an atheist by some sources. Konica strove for a more refined Western culture in Albania, but he also valued his country's traditions. He was, for instance, one of the first to propagate the idea of editing the texts of older Albanian literature. In an article entitled \\"P√´r themelimin e nj√´ gjuh√´s letrarishte shqip\\", (On the foundation of an Albanian literary language), published in the first issue of Albania, Konica also pointed to the necessity of creating a unified literary language. He suggested the most obvious solution, that the two main dialects, Tosk and Gheg, should be fused and blended gradually. His own fluid style was highly influential in the refinement of southern Albanian Tosk prose writing, which decades later was to form the basis of the modern Albanian literary language (standard language).  Albania (periodical)  A young Faik Konica in national Albanian dress, 1918 While in Brussels, in 1896‚Äì7 Konica started the publication of the periodical Albania, with publication ending in 1909, after he departed for the USA. It was printed both in Brussels and Paris. The magazine was one of the most important rilindas magazines of that time. Albanian publications were published abroad as the Ottoman Empire forbid the writing of Albanian and like other Albanian writers of the time Konica used a pseudonym Trank Spiro Bey, named after a Catholic Ottoman figure Trank Spiro, to bypass those conditions for his works. In 1903‚Äì1904, Faik Konica was a resident at Oakley Crescent in Islington, London. There he continued to edit and publish, under the pseudonym Trank Spiro Beg, the dual language (French/Albanian) periodical Albania that he had founded in Brussels in 1897. He contributed bitingly sarcastic articles on what he saw as the cultural backwardness and naivety of his compatriots, stressed the need for economic development and national unity among Muslim and Christian Albanians and opposed armed struggle. Support for a better Ottoman administration was advocated for by Konica through reforms in Albania. Konica's mastery of complexity and fine details of the Albanian language and its dialects was reflected in his writing style being refined and rich in expression. He also endeavored to enrich Albanian vocabulary through words of the people and folklore raising the ability of the Albanian language to treat complex and difficult topics, unparalleled among other Albanian language publications of the time. Albania contributed to the development of national sentiment among Albanians through focusing on topics such as folklore, poetry, Albanian history and the medieval figure of Skanderbeg. Albania helped to spread awareness of Albanian culture and the Albanian cause across Europe, and was highly influential in the development and refinement of Southern Albanian prose writing. In the words of the famous French poet Guillaume Apollinaire, \\"Konica turned a rough idiom of sailors inns into a beautiful, rich and supple language\\". Konica also published the works of Albanian writers of the time like Aleksand√´r Stavre Drenova, Andon Zako √áajupi, Filip Shiroka, Gjergj Fishta, Kostandin Kristoforidhi, Thimi Mitko and so on. Theodor Anton Ippen, a diplomat of Austria-Hungary, was one of the authors whose texts were published in the Konica's periodical. Konica assured Ippen that he and his friends believed that Albania should be in political and military union with Austria. Writing in his periodical Albania during 1906 Konica viewed independence as being some \\"twenty years\\" away and stressed that focus be devoted toward placing the Albanian nation \\"on the road to civilization\\" that would lead to \\"liberation\\". A committee founded by Dervish Hima in Paris that sought to make Albert Ghica the prince of Albania established close ties with Konica, who at the time was pro-Austrian. Konica viewed Italo-Albanians (Arb√´resh√´) as Italian citizens who would have difficulty going against Italian interests while at the same time supporting the conflicting goal of Albanian autonomy or independence and refused to cooperate with them. Italo-Albanians criticized his pro-Austrian position, while Konica defended it on grounds that Austria encouraged Albanian national and linguistic expression among Catholic Albanians in its schools unlike Italy. The Young Turks (CUP) had a hostile view of Albanian leaders such as Faik Konica who were doing political activities with the assistance of outside powers. Konica during his lifetime developed a reputation of being at times \\"irritable by temperament\\", \\"self- righteous in attitude\\" and for going into polemics. These issues affected his work with a decline of circulation of Albania as disagreements with Albanian patriots occurred who viewed his works on culture, nationality and rights as being too indirect on the Albanian question unlike the publication Drita. Konica was unable to attend the Albanian Alphabet Congress of 1908, due to receiving his invitation late, something which he considered was done on purpose. Whilst in Brussels, Konica had a correspondence with Apollinaire regarding an article published by the poet in L'Europen. When Apollinaire came to London seeking to regain the affections of Annie Playden, an English governess he had met and fallen in love with in Germany, he stayed with Konica at Oakley Crescent. Apollinaire published a memoir of Konica in the Mercure de France on May 1, 1912, which begins: \\"Of the people I have met and whom I remember with the greatest pleasure, Faik Bey Konica is one of the most unusual\\". He recalls:  Political activities and death  Konica organized the Albanian Congress of Trieste, held February 27 ‚Äì March 6, 1913. Konica depicted on an Albanian postal stamp Konica went to Boston, US in autumn of 1909 where he took over as chief-editor of Dielli newspaper, published by Besa-Bes√´n society, a political-cultural organization of Albanian-American diaspora. With the creation of Vatra, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America, his role inside the Albanian community of US grew and he became general- secretary of Vatra. Konica was a close collaborator of Fan Noli and one of the main figures in Vatra's and Dielli's history. In 1911, he published Trumbeta e Krujes (Kruja's trumpet), a very short lived newspaper in St. Louis, MO. On November 17, 1912, Vatra held a mass gathering in Boston and Konica was the main speaker rallying the Albanian diaspora in the US to oppose any partition of Albania, due to the Balkan Wars. He got disappointed with the Austro- Hungarian authorities and Ismail Qemali personally, after Qemali's approval for the creation of an Austro-Italian bank (though named Bank of Albania - ), which was feared amongst Albanians as having been created for massive purchasing of land properties and controlling the future economy of Albania. Konica was one of the main organizers of the Albanian Congress of Trieste in 1913. On November 20, 1913 he went in conflict with Essad Pasha and left Durres together with his collaborator Fazil Pasha Toptani. In 1921, he went back to the US where he became president of Vatra, and a columnist in Dielli. In 1929, Ahmet Zogu - newly proclaimed King Zog I of Albania would appoint him as Albanian Ambassador to the United States despite his very low opinion on Zogu. He carried this duty until 1939 when Fascist Italy invaded Albania. Konica was a harsh critic of King Zog's decision to abandon Albania on the eve of the Italian invasion. He died in Washington on December 15, 1942 and was buried in Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston. In 1998 his remains were transferred to Tirana and interred at the Tirana Park on the Artificial Lake.

History The hospital has its origins in the \\"Establishment for Gentlewomen During Temporary Illness\\" founded at Cavendish Square in March 1850. On opening, it had 11 beds, and employed nurses as and when required. Florence Nightingale became superintendent in August 1853, a week before it moved to Harley Street, and installed hot water on all floors, and a windlass to deliver hot foods quickly from the kitchen to beds. Under her governance, it was made non-sectarian and renamed the \\"Institute for Gentlewomen During Illness\\", taking in windows and daughters of professionals, the clergy and military personnel. She left for the Crimean War the following year. The foundation stone for a new purpose-built facility in Lisson Grove was laid by the Duchess of Albany in January 1909 and the new facility was officially opened by the Princess of Wales in March 1910. The hospital was renamed the \\"Florence Nightingale Hospital for Gentlewomen\\" after Florence Nightingale's death in August 1910. The hospital did not join the National Health Service in 1948 and instead was acquired by Bupa in 1978.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 and the former Register of the National Estate on 28 May 1996.  History  Wyoming was built by Quarton L. Deloitte in 1881, around an earlier stone cottage, \\"The Hermitage\\", which had been home in the 1870s to shipwright James Yeend. Yeend ran his yard below, and its wharf was almost certainly the original of Wharf Road. Wyoming was designed by Mansfield Bros., a pre-eminent Victorian firm who designed many public buildings, including Balmain Primary School and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Deloitte was son of a sea captain who had grown up in nearby Birch Grove House. He was secretary of the Colonial Sugar Refinery (CSR) for 50 years.Read, 2011, 6 Deloitte was a prominent citizen of Balmain, patron of Sydney Rowing Club for decades and often referred to as the father of rowing. His family was associated with Birchgrove (and Wharf Road in particular) for nearly 100 years.AHC, 1996 Deloitte was a keen gardener, terracing the steep site and laying out lawns, trees, shrubs and a glass house. In Deloitte's absence in 1884 Wyoming was tenanted by legendary Russian scientist, explorer and humanist, Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay (1846-1888) with his wife Margaret, daughter of five-times Premier of New South Wales Sir John Robertson. Although little-known in Australia, Miklouho-Maclay is revered as a folk hero in Russia and the Ukraine. The property became the focus of international attention for its association with Miklouho-Maclay, who established the biological research station at Watsons Bay (entered in the Register of the National Estate) and was responsible for anthropological and exploration activity in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. When Deloitte died in 1927, Wyoming was quickly absorbed by the adjacent maritime industry of Nicholson Bros. & later Stannards Bros. Set below the street it was soon forgotten and neglected. In 1989 it was threatened with demolition as part of redundant Balmain maritime industry; its owners wanted to replace it with 10 town houses and others in front of Nos. 21 & 23\\\\. Leichhardt Council's meeting considering the application was addressed by Soviet Consul General, Ivan Shchbakov. The meeting was filmed and shown on television in the Soviet Union and reported in Pravda. A usually then-divided Leichhardt Municipal Council passed a unanimous motion to reject the application and requested a State Government demolition prevention order, which was accepted, followed by NSW State Heritage Register listing. In 1994 a conservation management plan was prepared for the owners by Clive Lucas, Stapleton & Partners and used as the basis for restoring the house. Work began in 1994. Clive Lucas, Stapleton & Partners and particularly Ian Stapleton left his signature with creation of a conservatory-kitchen, added to the original stone-flagged scullery. The house was converted to a single residence by removing the flats' many kitchens and bathrooms and closed-in verandahs, which were re-opened. This left original fabric mostly intact. Evidence of the flats and maritime industry era survive in retained large power board, cabling, letter boxes and wire front fence. Historic photos by Harold Cazneaux in a 1929 Australian Home Beautiful magazine article were an invaluable guide to multiple discoveries: original iron lacework identified when a waterfront burn-off was approved by the EPA; first floor verandah posts that'd become part of an arbor; parts of finials and a ridge capping of the Orchid house found lying around. Others were made: a network of hexagonal drainage channels in the Orchid house floor; the original well described in an 1868 advertisement as \\"never-failing spring well\\" under the main verandah floor and the 1850s stone flagging under a flat's floor and in the scullery. Heritage consultant James Broadbent advised on contemporary wallpaper, furniture and soft furnishings. Restoration of the Victorian garden began in 1999. Heritage landscape architect Michael Lehany designed the garden around the house in 2000. He created in front of the house an intricate Victorian garden, including the cactus garden, before they became a necessity due to water restrictions. Previous existing but deteriorated structures were copied, stone balustrades and other fixtures and paths were re-laid or restored. Extensive traditional planting was undertaken by the owners to augment what survived. The woven wire arbors were copied from one surviving, the stone balustrades were restored and old concrete steps and paths repaired and re-laid. The structure of the old garden was re-affirmed before being overlaid, or furnished, with rich and varied - but traditional - planting. This reflects both Deloitte's and the present owners' horticultural interests: orchids, cacti and succulents, bamboos and in particular, frangipanis. A surviving tree near the street is an evergreen, or holly or holm oak, Quercus ilex from the Mediterranean. Others were several varied frangipanis and a tree gardenia. The early dock had been closed in with Moruya granite, cut-offs from the Harbour Bridge. It was restored in 2000: this part in granite; the rest in large sandstone blocks. The new garden on the waterfront below the retaining wall was designed by James Broadbent and has been largely constructed and planted in 2011. The 1850s seawall was derelict. Deloitte, an avid orchid collector, built the Victorian Orchid house, a rare survivor on Sydney harbour. It required extensive restoration. Imported as a prefabricated structure from England, it would have proven unsuited for orchids other than tropical ones. He then built the waterfront fernery (replacing shipyard sheds) with a massive vaulted roof of slats on a brick plinth. Only the plinth remained. The 1904 sewer installation sadly had to go through the back of the fernery. Although care was obviously taken, the works and especially the resultant rubble greatly downgraded the area. The roof eventually became ruinous and was removed. With little known of the fernery's detail and nothing of the planting of this lower area, no attempt has been made to re-create any form of \\"period\\" garden. Rather its location and aspect have been embraced, after removing decades-worth of rubbish and weeds. For shade a pergola was built in ironbark saplings, wire and split bamboo, beneath the retaining wall. The simplicity is deceptive: as everything, bulldozers, machines, stone, rubbish, weeds and soil, had to be taken in and out by barge. In World War II, the stub wall was filled in with soil so enabling a veggie patch to be created. This has been reinstated. The dock survived in a vestigial form: today it is a bog garden.  Description  Wyoming is a large, two-storey rendered brick, Italianate style residence, with a 1900 rendered brick and corrugated asbestos cement roof addition at the rear, and several subsequent inferior additions. It is an excellent example of a Victorian Italianate waterfront villa. It also features a large garden. The building and garden contribute to the tonwscape value of the area and can be viewed from the water. The exterior of Wyoming features a slate roof with tile hips and ridges and distinctive chimneys. The interiors consist of a typical Victorian four square plan with a central stairway, connected to a two-storey staff wing. The main roof is titled in slate with terracotta ridging, while the staff wing roof is terra cotta tiled. The main house has a projecting bay at its east end and a projecting tower like room at its west end. The front northern elevation is covered with original timber and cast iron verandah, since enclosed and converted to bathrooms, kitchens, bedrooms etc. The garden features native trees, and is bordered by a cast iron gate and gate posts. A glass house, which was largely derelict for many years, was reconstructed in the 1990s, at which time the garden underwent sympathetic replanting. = Modifications and dates = * Verandahs infilled, interesting later addition to street side. Stucco - Ashlar. * Windows modified. * Entry lobby and rear complete stair (top newell missing), tesselated tiles, single storey. * Verandah with cast iron columns stone steps from verandah, sea walls (top course rebuilt in smaller stones). * Extensive restoration program underway since 1995 with Ian Stapleton advising Significance The combination of Wyoming's architectural qualities, its contextual impact, its degree of intactness and its historical associations make the villa a building of considerable cultural significance at the local, state and national level. This is one of the last waterfront Victorian villas remaining on the Balmain Peninsula. Architecturally, it is a fine example of the Italianate style, having been designed by the Mansfield Brothers, who were perhaps Sydney's pre- eminent mid Victorian architects. The villa has landmark qualities to Snails Bay and to Sydney Harbour. It has streetscape significance to Wharf Road and retains its original Victorian curtilage with a remnant garden. It has local significance for its association with Quarton Deloitte, known for his contribution to the local area and a pioneer in Australian rowing. It has state and international significance for its association with the eminent Russian scientist and humanitarian, Nicolai Miklouho-Maclay.AHC statement of significance, 1996  See also   References  = Bibliography =        = Attribution = Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Birchgrove, New South Wales Category:Houses in New South Wales Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register ","title":"Wyoming, Birchgrove"},{"id":"58614487","text":"Vyacheslav Vasilievich Markin (born 1948 in Leningrad, RSFSR - 1992 in Ryazan, Russia), known as the \\"Skopinsky Maniac\\", was a Soviet serial killer, robber, rapist and arsonist who committed 6 brutal murders.  Biography  Markin was born and lived in Leningrad, spending his childhood in a communal apartment. He never met his father, and was cold towards his mother. He also did not have any friends among his peers. Markin committed his first theft at school - he was running late for class and, passing by the empty teacher's room, he saw someone's open bag, and in it - a purse in which there was money. He took the money, left the school, hid it and then returned. Despite the fact that the police was called, the wallet was not found. This pleased Vyacheslav, causing him to have a feeling of impunity. A month later, he again committed theft, stealing 120 rubles and giving them to his mother, claiming that he had found them on the road. His mother did not question it, and soon bought a bike for her son and made a magnificent feast to celebrate. After some time, he fell out with his mother and ran away from home. Markin began to wander in different cities for a long time. In Dushanbe, he survived by pickpocketing, for which he was caught several times and sent to a colony. He gained experience while imprisoned, and even became somewhat of an \\"authority\\", even successfully escaping several times. After one of these escapes, from a colony in Chusovoy in the Perm Oblast, he climbed into an apartment, where he began looking for money. He was caught by the mistress of the house, whom he raped, beat and tied up. Markin was eventually arrested in Kirov for theft, and was soon charged not only with escaping, but with rape. He was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for everything. In the colony, he began to quarrel with the local \\"pahan\\" Valery 'Ryaby' Ryabchikov. Their confrontation led to a fight, in which Ryabchikov beat Markin. Learning that his opponent was preparing for an escape, Markin informed the colony's authorities of this. As a result, Ryaby\\" was thrown to the deadline for several years. His people then brutally beat up Markin and threw him out into the cold, but he was miraculously saved by a prisoner who happened to pass by and became his friend after being released. = Murders = After his release, Markin went to the town of Skopin in Ryazan Oblast, where his fellow colony friend lived. There he met a divorced woman, and they began a romantic relationship. He honestly confessed to her that he had been convicted, but it was due to a false denunciation. They got married, and Markin took his wife's last name. In the city he had a reputation as a decent, working man. He would always tell his wife that he was going on business trips, when in fact he was robbing people's apartments, bringing money and bags full of items home. Soon his wife became pregnant, so Markin committed more and more robberies to keep treating her well. In late 1990, in Ryazan and in Moscow, he was caught at the crime scene by the apartment owners. He beat them and then tied them with special \\"sea\\" knots, which got even tighter when they tried to get free. Both victims miraculously survived. In the spring of 1991 in Ryazan, Markin involuntarily crossed paths with the former cellmate Ryaby, who was about to kill him. However, everything turned out exactly the opposite, and together with his buddy Markin killed Ryabchikov with particular cruelty, enjoying the process. Then they took the body to the Skopinsky District, threw it near the railway embankment on Skopin-Briquette and unsuccessfully tried to burn it. After that, Markin realized that it was not difficult to commit murder. During a robbery in Ryazan, he killed the apartment's landlady, who found him during the crime. The most terrible crime he committed was a triple murder in the village of Mokhovoye, where his mother-in-law lived. At night, Markin climbed into the house of a neighbor, who had a sister-in-law and a small grandson. Markin tied them up, raped the daughter-in-law, tortured the child to death, and then brutally killed the mother and grandmother, then set the house on fire. In the morning he arrived in Novomichurinsk, climbed into the first apartment he found, and killed the mistress who was present. While investigating the murder in Mokhovoye, one of the operatives drew attention to the children's swing near the house of Markin's mother-in-law, which had been tied into a sea knot. The same exact knots were found tied to the victims' bodies in Mokhovoye, Ryazan and Novomichurinsk, and the body of Ryabchikov in Skopin. A search was carried out of Markin's wife's apartment, from which stolen items were seized. Markin was soon arrested at a hotel in Ryazan, and in his hotel room were found stolen items from the last murder in Novomichurinsk. His case was led by the famous Ryazan investigator Dmitry Plotkin. Markin remained silent, but soon confessed under the weight of the evidence, talking cold-bloodedly and without regret about the murders. In 1992, when the materials of the case had already been referred to the court, Markin hanged himself in his cell.  In the mediaIt is important to note that the information in these documentaries vary wildly, despite the participation of the same experts in them. In the film \\"The Last Knot\\" it is stated that Markin learned to tie knots in his childhood thanks to his neighbor, while in the film \\"Dman the snuffbox\\" it is said that he learned complex knots in the colony from a cellmate who had served in the Navy. In the movie \\"The Dead Knot\\" it is claimed that Markin died from lung cancer before sentencing.  * Documentary film \\"The Last Knot\\" from the series \\"Criminal Russia\\". * Documentary film \\"The Dead Knot\\" from the series \\"Invisible Battle\\". * Documentary film \\"Damn the snuffbox\\" from the series \\"The investigation was conducted...\\".

It was designed by Alfred Norman in the Italianate style and built by Messrs Jenkin and Hallett on New Passage Hill. It was named after Prince Albert, the late consort to Queen Victoria, and opened as the Royal Albert Hospital in December 1863. The hospital became the Royal Albert Hospital and Eye Infirmary in 1874 and, after a new nurses' home was completed in May 1901, it became the Prince of Wales Hospital in 1934. On joining the National Health Service in 1948, it became the South Devon and East Cornwall Hospital (Devonport). It finally became Plymouth General Hospital in 1963.

Lumsden was the oldest of the four sons of James Lumsden (1812-1882) and Grace (n√©e McTavish, died 1894) of Peterhead in Aberdeenshire. Aged 22 Lumsden obtained a post with the Borelli Tea Estate in the Tezpur district of Assam. On arriving in India Lumsden attempted to popularise the volunteer movement in Assam, perhaps taking the volunteer movement in his native Scotland as his model. When the Durrung Mounted Rifles was founded in 1887 Lumsden was appointed a captain in the force. In 1888 this unit was renamed the Assam Valley Light Horse and Lumsden commanded F Squadron in the Durrung District.Ian F W Beckett (ed), Citizen Soldiers and the British Empire, 1837‚Äì1902, Routledge (2012) - Google Books pg 117 Lumsden left India in 1893 but maintained contact with his comrades there, which was useful six years later when he raised Lumsden's Horse to fight in the Boer War in South Africa.

Biography  Lorentz's father Rudolf Fedorovich Lorentz was a German railway engineer and his mother Milena Nikolayevna Chegodayev came from the Russian nobility. Since his father refused in 1906 to suppress a strike, he was no longer allowed to work on the state railway, so he worked for private railway companies in the Caucasus. The family survived the revolutionary turmoil and civil war near Sochi and then moved to Tbilisi, where he began studying at the Technical University in 1926. From 1928 he studied at the University of Leningrad with the diploma degree in 1931 and the candidate's degree in 1935 (equivalent to a doctorate). At that time he published several works, also on the topic of his dissertation, Bernstein polynomials. After that, he was a lecturer in Leningrad. After the German occupation of the Leningrad area, he was first evacuated to the Caucasus, where he was captured by the German occupation and classified as a German with his family in a camp in Poland. He sent mathematical work to Konrad Knopp at the University of T√ºbingen, where he received his doctorate in 1944 under Knopp, with thesis Einige Fragen der Limitierungstheorie (Some questions of limitation theory). After the war, he was stateless for over ten years. He habilitated in T√ºbingen and taught from 1946 to 1948 at the University of Frankfurt and 1948/49 as honorary professor in T√ºbingen. In 1949, he emigrated to Canada and became an assistant, and then assistant professor, at the University of Toronto. From 1953 to 1958 he was a professor at Wayne State University and from 1958 to 1969 at Syracuse University. From 1969 to his retirement in 1980, he was a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He dealt with analysis, specifically approximation theory, interpolation theory of operators, and functional analysis. In 1972 he was awarded honorary doctor in T√ºbingen, and 1996 in W√ºrzburg. In 1973 he received the Humboldt Research Award. His doctoral students include Paul Butzer (de). His son Rudolph Lorentz is Professor of Mathematics at Texas A & M University. He married in 1942, and had five children. He was a passionate chess player and traveled to chess tournaments.

Biography  Born in Pokotilova, Uman district on 4 July 1917, Livsic moved to Odessa with his family when he was four years old. His father was an associate professor of mathematics who frequented leading Soviet mathematicians in Odessa like Nikolai Chebotaryov, Veniamin Fedorovich Kagan, Mark Krein and Samuil O. Shatunovsky. In 1931 Livsic graduated from school was a close friend of the mathematician Israel Markowitsch Glasman (1916‚Äì1968) at the school. Both were very interested in philosophy and therefore decided to study natural science and mathematics. After graduation, Livsic attended first a school for radio engineers and from 1933 the newly created Departmenr of Physics and Mathematics of the Odessa State University, with Mark Krein, Mark Naimark and Boris Yakovlevich Lewin as teachers. Kerin was one of the major figures of the Soviet school of functional analysis and headed a very active school of functional analysis. Lewin was a prominent Soviet mathematician who made significant contributions to function theory. Study colleagues of Livsic were the fellow mathematicians A.P. Artyomenko, David Milman, Vitold Shmulyan, M.A. Rutman and V.A. Potapov. Originally, he worked on the moment problem, at that time the main research area of Krein, and with quasi-analytical functions. Soon after, he worked on the theory of operators, inspired by the work of Marshall Stone, John von Neumann, Abraham Plessner and Naum Ilyich Akhiezer . Following the evacuation of the Odessa State University during the Second World War, Livsic received in 1942 in Maikop his Ph.D. on the application of Hermitian operators theory to the generalised moment problem under supervision of Mark Krein. In 1945, Livsic passed his habilitation thesis on generalisations of von Neumann's extension theory that was evaluated by prominent mathematicians, namely Stefan Banach, Israel Gelfand, Mark Naimark and Plessner at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics. Livsic could not return directly to the Odessa State University following the dismantling of Krein's school under the accusation of promoting too many Jewish mathematicians. Livsic himself was considered not being \\"suited for representing the Ukrainian culture\\". He taught until 1957 at the Hydrometeorological Institute in Odessa, then at the Mining Institute of Kharkiv. In 1962, he joined the department of mathematical physics at the University of Kharkiv at the invitation of Naum Akhiezer. His study focused on the applications of functional analysis to quantum theory. He worked on the physical interpretation of non-self adjoining operators and he developed a theory of open systems which are physical systems which interact with the environment. These research is compiled in two monographs. After moving to Tbilissi with his family, he started working on a generalisation of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. He moved to Israel in 1978 and settled in Beersheba. He became a professor at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and started to work with Naftali Kravitsky on a theory of several commuting operators.

Biography  Labutkin was born in 1910 in St. Petersburg to a working-class family. At the end of the 1920s, he got a job as a gunsmith at the Krasnoznamyonets arms factory. In 1930, while engaged in uprooting stumps with pyroxylin, Labutkin accidentally produced a premature detonation, as a result of which he lost his right hand. In this regard, he could no longer work as a gunner, and therefore he got a job as a steam conductor at the Okhta Combine in Leningrad. Labutkin was extremely passionate about fashionable things. According to the memoirs of his acquaintances, he was very fond of wearing a dark jacket and a wide-brimmed hat, which created an opinion that he was an important personality. On August 30, 1933, Labutkin, disguised as a mushroom picker, took a revolver and went to the forest located behind the Powder plants in the area of Prigorodny village. There he met a company of two men and three women, after which he fired several shots at them. Four died on the spot, and one woman died after some time in the hospital, without having time to give the investigators any evidence. The bullets that the killer had used in committing the crime were made by his acquaintance from the elements of a ball bearing. From the crime scene, Labutkin took away items of insignificant value, which suggests that self- interest was not a driving force in his crimes. On December 2, 1933, in the same forest, Labutkin shot two more people. He took a couple of valenki, food and several other items from the corpses. On April 11, 1934, Labutkin ambushed and shot down an elderly locksmith. The murderer stole money and the suitcase with instruments from the murdered man, also pulling off the gold crowns from his teeth. Labutkin's crimes were characterized by long pauses between the attacks. Six months later, on November 13, 1934, he shot a birdwatcher who was inspecting songbirds. The criminal then stole a cage with captured birds in it. On January 11, 1935, Labutkin shot down two married couples walking in the woods in the span of two hours. Again, he did not steal items of any special value from the crime scene. A month later, on February 17, 1935, he killed a lonely worker. He used his wife Maria to distract his last victims. On March 18, 1935, Labutkin made another attack on a couple. The man was killed, but the woman survived with slight injuries. She identified the murderer, and Labutkin was soon detained. = Trial and execution = The investigation into the Labutkin case was short-lived, as Labutkin himself confessed to committing 12 murders. In addition to Maria Labutkina, several others were also arrested on suspicion of concealing the killer's crimes. In the summer of 1935, a trial was held, during which the Special Council of the NKVD sentenced Labutkin to death, while the remaining defendants got long term prison sentences. Soon after, Labutkin was executed by firing squad. = In the media = * Documentary film \\"Shooter\\" from the series \\"The investigation was conducted...\\" See also * List of Russian serial killers  References   Literature  * A.

On 30 March, in a match against Leeds United, his 40th appearance of the season, Dalton's leg was badly broken. He played once more for Newcastle's first team, some two-and-a-half years later, but, as the Evening Chronicle wrote, his \\"bright career was tragically dimmed\\" when he broke his leg, and he was released on a free transfer in May 1967. He signed for Brighton & Hove Albion, established himself in their first team, and made 28 appearances in 1967‚Äì68, of which 24 were in the Third Division, before re-breaking the leg in January 1968. He retired from senior football forthwith, but remained with Brighton, studying physiotherapy and coaching the juniors. When Brighton manager Freddie Goodwin took over at Birmingham City in 1970, Willie Bell and Dalton accompanied him as coach and trainer respectively. The Birmingham club were later fined for making an illegal approach to and then employing Bell without his contracted club's permission, but a similar complaint regarding Dalton was dismissed because he was available on a free transfer. Dalton was at Birmingham until early 1976, when he joined Coventry City as physiotherapist. He remained with that club for two decades in various capacities, and was the physio of the team that won the 1986‚Äì87 FA Cup.

Life and career McAteer was born in Smithstone, Cumbernauld, in 1876, the son of Patrick McAteer, who had migrated to the area to work in the coal mines, and his wife, Margaret Starrs. He played junior football for Kilsyth Wanderers and Smithston Hibernian before moving to England in 1898 to sign for Football League First Division club Bolton Wanderers. He spent four seasons with Bolton, scoring 10 goals from 59 league appearances: they were relegated in the first, he helped them gain promotion in 1899‚Äì1900 and played regularly in the third season but lost his place in the fourth, and was released in 1902. After two seasons in the English Southern League, the first with West Ham United, during which he played only 13 league matches, and the second with Brighton & Hove Albion, where he was appointed captain and played in every match but one, McAteer returned to Scotland where he signed for Dundee in May 1904. He was a regular in the 1904‚Äì05 Scottish Division One season as Dundee finished in mid-table, but played only four matches the following season and moved on, and to Lancashire Combination club Carlisle United. He played for Clyde during the 1906‚Äì07 season before returning to Carlisle, captaining the team to the second round proper of the 1907‚Äì08 FA Cupno thanks to his missing a penalty in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Brentford. After they were eliminated from the competition in February 1908, he joined Clyde on a permanent basis. McAteer captained Clyde as they defeated both Rangers and Celtic to reach the 1910 Scottish Cup Final, a match only settled after two replays when Clyde lost to his former club, Dundee. At the end of the season, the 34-year-old McAteer signed for Celtic. Never a first-team regular, McAteer still played in 24 Division One matches for his new club, and scored a late goal in the 1911 Scottish Cup Final replay against Hamilton Academical to clinch a 2‚Äì0 win. His performances earned him a place in the Home Scots team that faced the Anglo-Scots in an international trial in March 1911, but no call-up ensued. In 1912, McAteer briefly played for Wishaw Thistle before returning to league football on a part-time basis with Albion Rovers and Abercorn. When war broke out, McAteer enlisted and served with the Cameron Highlanders; he was badly wounded in 1915. After the war he continued as a colliery surface worker. McAteer and his wife, Mary Clinton, had several children. He died in Kilsyth, Stirlingshire, in 1959 at the age of 83.

When the Nazis came to power in 1933, he fled to Britain.Jackson 1981, pp. 103-104Humphreys 1980, p. 147 In England, Conze taught German, philosophy, and psychology at evening classes, and later lectured on Buddhism and Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ at various universities. However, the only permanent academic post he was offered had to be turned down because US immigration officials declined him a work permit on the basis of his past as a Communist. A midlife crisis in 1941 saw him adopt Buddhism as his religion, having previously been influenced by Theosophy and astrology. He spent a brief period in the New Forest pursuing meditation and an ascetic lifestyle (during which he developed scurvy). At the end of this period he moved to Oxford where he began to work on Sanskrit texts from the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ tradition. He continued to work on these texts for the rest of his life. Conze was married twice: to Dorothea Finkelstein and to Muriel Green. He had one daughter with Dorothea. In 1979 Conze self-published two volumes of memoirs entitled Memoirs of a Modern Gnostic. Conze produced a third volume which contained material considered to be too inflammatory or libelous to publish while the subjects were alive.Jackson 1981, p. 102Houston 1980, p.92 No copy of the third volume is known to exist. The Memoirs are the principal sources for Conze's biography and reveal much about his personal life and attitudes. Scholarship Conze was educated in several German Universities and showed a propensity for languages. He claimed that by twenty-four, he knew fourteen languages.Conze 1979: I 4 Conze's first major published work was on the theory of dialectical materialism. This continues to receive attention, with his book The Principle of Contradiction being reprinted in 2016.Heine 2016 Following a mid-life crisis Conze turned to Buddhism and was particularly influenced by D. T. Suzuki. He made his name for his editions and translations of Sanskrit texts of the Buddhist Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ literature. He published translations of all the principal texts of the genre, including the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ (8000 Line), Ratnagu·πáasamcayagƒÅthƒÅ, Pa√±cavi·πÉ≈õatisƒÅhasrikƒÅ (25,000 Line), VajracchedikƒÅ, and Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅh·πõdaya. All of these show the explicit influence of Suzuki's Theosophy infused Zen Buddhism. A glance at a complete bibliography of Conze's oeuvre confirms that he was a man of industry and focus. His contribution to the field of Buddhist Studies, particularly of the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ literature, has had a major influence on subsequent generations. Legacy In his essay Great Buddhists of the Twentieth Century (Windhorse Publications: 1996), British writer and teacher of Buddhism, and personal friend of Conze's, Sangharakshita writes that \\"Dr. Conze was a complex figure, and it is not easy to assess his overall significance.... He was a self-confessed √©litist, which is usually something people are ashamed of nowadays, but he wasn‚Äôt ashamed of it at all.... Nor did he approve of either democracy or feminism, which makes him a veritable ogre of ‚Äòpolitical incorrectness‚Äô.\\" Nevertheless, Sangharakshita summarizes Conze's legacy as a scholar of Buddhism as follows: Ji Yun, Professor of the Buddhist College of Singapore, describes Conze's legacy as follows:  Selected bibliography For a complete bibliography of Conze's works see the website, Conze Memorial http://www.conze.elbrecht.com/ * 1932.

In the span of 13 years (with a break), he raped and killed 16 girls and women. He committed his crimes in Ust- Kamenogorsk, in the area of the \\"Combine of silk fabrics\\" factory.  Biography  Ivanov worked as driver. He was married, and his own daughter was married as well. Once, he returned home from work and found his wife in bed with a lover. After this he developed a hatred for certain women, vowing to kill those who cheated on their husbands. During the investigation, Ivanov said that he talked with a lot of women learning about their opinions towards men. If the woman spoke ill of her husband or men as a whole, he killed her. He would rape and subsequently choke his victims to death. After the murder, as a rule, he would take some of deceased's personal belongings. He was eventually sentenced to 3 years imprisonment for attempted rape. In the colony Ivanov worked as a driver, and with the opportunity to travel beyond the colony, he committed several crimes while still serving time. From 1977 to 1987, Ivanov did not kill, as his personal life was again adjusted. But after he broke up with his partner in 1986, he returned to his criminal way of life. In 1987, he killed a 16-year-old girl. At the crime scene, an aluminum button and a hair sample were found that did not belong to the victim. An ambush was set up at the murder scene, and on the next day, when the maniac came back, he was arrested. Under the pressure of evidence (two of his cohabitants, to whom he had given items from the victims, gave the police a purse with his fingerprint, and his jacket lacked an aluminum button), Ivanov confessed to the rape/murders of 16 women and girls and 14 separate rapes. Ivanov perfectly remembered all the events of many years give or take the slightest detail, directing police to all the crime scenes almost without error. He said that he remembered the faces of his victims, and to prove this, the investigators devised a unique experiment - \\"identification of the contrary\\": they showed him photos of different women, so he would determine which of them he had raped or killed. Ivanov pointed at his victims without any mistake. For the murder of one of these women, committed in 1974, the victim's husband was convicted. By that time he had served most of the term - 7 out of 12 years. The verdict against him was later abolished, and the murder correctly imputed to Ivanov. Ivanov himself asked for the death penalty, and in 1989, he was sentenced to death. Before the execution he asked to arrange a meeting with his daughter, but she flatly refused to come to her father. Later in 1989, Ivanov was executed by firing squad. = In the media = * Documentary film \\"The Involuntary Murderer\\" from the series \\"Legends of the Soviet Investigation\\".

Biography =During the Fascist regime= Ossicini's father, Cesare, was one of the founders of the Italian People's Party. He enrolled at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Rome, two years in advance. In December 1937, while still a student, he became a volunteer at the Fatebenefratelli Hospital on the Tiber Island in Rome. In April 1938, at a FUCI conference held in Orvieto, Ossicini supported the moral duty of all Christians to fight against fascism. Once he returned to Rome, he was interrogated and filed by the fascist police. In October of the same year, at a new conference of FUCI in Genoa, he appealed to Italian Catholics against racism and against fascism, accusing the regime of connivance with nazism. Ossicini disagreed with Alcide De Gasperi on his project regarding the reconstitution of a single party of Catholics, the future Christian Democracy, placed at the center of the political alignment. On 18 May 1943, Ossicini was arrested by the fascists during a raid and was imprisoned for more than two months. Despite being violently beaten for a few days, he only admitted that he has expressed criticism of the racial legislation of fascism, since it was contrasting with the Christian Doctrine. On this occasion he heard the word \\"cattocomunista\\" for the first time from the fascist police. On 30 September 1943, Ossicini received a letter from Giulio Andreotti, in which the future Prime Minister expressed \\"in the name of the Pope\\" the opposition to an unconditioned collaboration between Catholics and the Italian Communist Party. Ossicini, with a note, replied that he disagreed with Andreotti. During World War II, Ossicini became one of the founders of the Christian Left party, close to the Italian Communist Party; the party dissolved in 1945 after that L'Osservatore Romano reaffirmed that only the Christian Democracy was entitled to represent Christians in politics. =After World War II= Graduated in Medicine at the end of 1944, Ossicini was immediately admitted as a volunteer assistant at the Fatebenefratelli Hospital. He enrolled in the specialization course in Psychiatry, dealing with nervous and mental diseases; in 1947 he became a University professor of Psychology at the Sapienza University of Rome. In 1968, Ossicini returns to politics and is elected to the Italian Senate as an independent in the PCI list and joined the group of the Independent Left; Ossicini confirmed his seat at Palazzo Madama uninterruptedly from 1968 to 1992. Between 1970 and 1989 he has been the promoter of the law for the establishment of the Order of Psychologists. He has also been Vice-president of the Senate from 1979 to 1983 and from 1985 to 1987. In 1995 he became Minister for Family and Social Solidarity of the Dini Cabinet. He joined Lamberto Dini's Italian Renewal and was re-elected for the last time in the Senate in 1996. In 2001 he moved to The Daisy and then in 2007 to the Democratic Party.

Established in the early 20th century, it housed approximately 7,000 rare or unique books and manuscripts dating back to at least the 16th century. According to the Central Registry of Looted Art, it was the most important Jewish library in Italy and one of the most important in the world. The contents of the library were looted by Nazi Germany shortly after the Raid of the Ghetto of Rome in October 1943, and have never been recovered. Two months later, the contents of the Collegio Rabbinico Italiano, the Italian Rabbinical College's library located in the same building, were also looted; only part of the contents of the latter library have been recovered. Contents The Biblioteca della Comunit√† Israelitica was set up in the early 20th century in rooms above the Great Synagogue of Rome at Lungotevere De' Cenci. Its contents consisted of publications that had previously been held at one of the five synagogues of the Roman Ghetto or other locations in the Jewish community of Rome. The library of the Italian Rabbinical College, housed in the same building, had been transferred from Florence to Rome in the 1930s. The latter was a teaching library of almost 10,000 volumes. The Biblioteca della Comunit√† Israelitica contained many rare or unique books and manuscripts, dating back to at least the 16th century. No complete catalogue exists, but visiting scholars compiled some specific lists during visits before the war. It is estimated that the library contained a quarter of all the work of the Sconcinos, Jewish Italian printers from the 16th century who later worked in Salonica and Constantinople, as well as 16th- century works by Daniel Bomberg, Alvise Bragadin, and Nicollet. The library contained approximately 7,000 volumes in all. A partial catalogue was compiled by Jewish Italian historian Isaiah Sonne in 1935, who classified the contents into texts printed by the Sconcinos, manuscripts, incunabula, 16th-century oriental copies printed in Constantinople, and special specimens. Sonne, however, complained that he was allowed to see only the second-best items in the library. The lack of a proper catalogue may have been inspired in part by a desire to protect the contents from destruction by the Catholic church which, historically, had done so before to Jewish publications. The Central Registry of Looted Art quoted an expert, Attilio Milano, who stated in a letter that \\"no other Italian Jewish library had so many priceless books and very few outside Italy exceeded it\\". Looting With the surrender of Italy on 8 September 1943, Germany occupied northern and central Italy, including the Italian capital, Rome. The libraries of the Jewish community in Rome soon attracted German attention. According to an eyewitness, two uniformed men visited the Biblioteca della Comunit√† Israelitica and the Italian Rabbinical College library, located in the same building, on 30 September and 1 October 1943. One of the two introduced himself as a teacher of Hebrew at an institute in Berlin, most likely Johannes Pohl from the Institute for Study of the Jewish Question, who had fulfilled a similar role at the Jewish libraries in Amsterdam. Attempts were made to receive support from the Fascist Italian government to retain the contents of the libraries in Italy, but these received no sympathy there. On 14 October 1943, two days before the raid on the Roman Ghetto, the contents of the Biblioteca della Comunit√† Israelitica and parts of the contents of the Rabbinical College library were taken away. The remainder of the contents of the Rabbinical College library were taken on 23 and 24 December 1943. A few isolated books and prints survived the looting either by being hidden by members of the community or overlooked by the Germans. Under the control of the German military administration, the contents of the library were loaded onto two railway cars by an Italian company and sent to Germany via Switzerland. A letter by the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce (ERR) from 21 January 1944, most likely referring to the second load of loot, stated that it had been delivered to an institute in Frankfurt am Main. The priceless contents of the community library were of special interest to the Rosenberg organisation, and it had set up a special organisation, the Sonderkommando Italien, for their activities in the country. The records of the correspondence of the ERR were destroyed by a bombing raid on Berlin in November 1943. The Italian commission trying to locate the library contents came to the conclusion that the first train in October did not go to Frankfurt but to Berlin, which would explain why some of the contents of the second train were found after the war. None of the contents of the first train were ever recovered. Fate of the contents Only part of the contents of the Rabbinical College library was recovered in 1947, consisting of 20 incunabula. None of the material taken from the Biblioteca della Comunit√† Israelitica was ever recovered. The most likely theory as to the fate of the library contents is that they were stored during the war in an area that became part of the postwar Occupation Zone of the Soviet Union. From there the contents were taken to the Soviet Union and could now possibly be located within the Russian Federation. Theories that the contents of the library were either destroyed during a bombing raid on the train transporting it to Germany, or in Germany itself, have been considered but discounted as less likely. In 2002, the Italian government established a special commission to pursue the recovery of the contents of the library, carrying out research in a number of European countries. The commission looked into the possibility that the missing contents either went to Frankfurt, Berlin, or Frankfurt via Berlin. The Frankfurt option was seen as the less likely one as much of the looted books that had been stored there or at another deposit, at Hungen, also in Hesse, had fallen into the hands of American forces after the war and been returned, including prints from the Rabbinical College. It is estimated that Nazi Germany looted up to 3 million books during World War II, of which 1.2 million were found at the end of the war at Hungen alone. The more likely option was that the contents went to Berlin and either remained there or were evacuated to Ratibor, Silesia (now Racib√≥rz, Poland), where, at either place, they would eventually have come under control of the Soviet Union. The commission's research was complicated by the fact that two competing organisations existed in Nazi Germany which acquired looted Jewish publications with the aim of creating a library, the Amt Rosenberg (the ERR) and the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (the SS), the latter with the aim of using it as a source of information on their perceived enemy. As no records for the first transport of the loot are known to have survived, there is no certainty which of the two organisations received the two rail cars from October 1943. The commission's research in Russia was also hampered by the fact that certain archives were closed to it, such as the archive of the Russian Federal Security Service. The lack of a proper catalogue has greatly hampered the recovery of the contents, as it is almost impossible to know what the library actually contained. In 1965, two Hebrew manuscripts with the stamp of the library were acquired by the Jewish Theological Seminary Library in New York, both of which were listed in the catalogue Sonne compiled in the 1930s. It is unclear how the manuscripts reached the United States and at what point after their cataloguing by Sonne in 1935 they were removed from the library. No details on the history of the two manuscripts between 1935 and 1965 could be established. The ultimate fate of the library's contents remain a mystery, however, as all investigations, including that of the Italian government commission, have been inconclusive.

His resonance theory became fundamental in Resonanz, published in 2016. A sociology of the world relationship formulated.  Resonance term  The term resonance is taken from physics to describe a subject‚Äìobject relationship as a vibrating system in which both sides mutually stimulate each other. In contrast to the physical meaning of the word, however, here they do not merely return the received sound, but speak \\"with their own voice\\". The subjects' relational abilities and their intersubjective structures are constituted by such resonance experiences or their absence. This is made clear by the primary relationship of the newborn to its reference person, by whose reception or rejection of interactions the fundamental relationship patterns develop. With the concept of resonance used in this way, an attempt is made to find a way of approaching the question of successful relations between subject and world in the sense of \\"good life\\" as free as possible from cultural evaluations and assumptions. The possible points of reference of such resonances are ubiquitous and are described in three basic axes: Horizontal resonances take place between two (or more) people, in love and family relationships, friendships or political space. Diagonal resonance axes are relationships to things and activities, vertical resonance axes are relationships to the great collective singulars: nature, art, history or religion. In all these contexts, intensive experiences are possible that make life experienceable as an intensive encounter or relationship for its own sake. This is juxtaposed with silent or instrumental world relations, determined by the orientation towards domination and making available, which are primarily concerned with the achievement of a useful goal. For example, a mountain tour can be a resonance experience as an intensive confrontation with the demands of the path and the encountering nature, as a purely purpose- oriented company but also instrumental and in this sense \\"mute\\". Obviously, world sections that are perceived as attractive or desirable are predestined for resonance experiences, while those that are perceived as hostile or anxious are expected to be \\"silent\\", non-resonant experiences. Another prerequisite for the establishment of resonances are strong evaluations of the subject, which give the object a significance that goes beyond desire or attractiveness. If an attempt is made to outline as resonance what people seek and long for in their innermost being, it is by no means conceived as a permanent state that can be established, but always as a selective, momentary success or self-adjustment that stands out against the background of the predominantly silent, instrumental. Resonance in this sense is therefore essentially characterized by the fact that it cannot be produced systematically and intentionally, but is ultimately unavailable.  Social theory  As a sociological theory, resonance theory deals with the social conditions that promote or hinder successful relationships. If the striving for resonance is regarded as ubiquitous human primary motivation, its concretization depends to a large extent on historical, geographical and cultural conditions. In particular, existential hardship and political repression complicate resonance experiences if they do not make them completely impossible. The promise of modernity is therefore to make resonance possible by overcoming political arbitrariness and improving material resources. Rosa sees this promise as an inherent contradiction of modernity, however, undermined by the conditions that progress, which is primarily geared to increasing resources, ultimately requires: Expanded resources expand the world accessible to the subject and thus his possibilities for resonance experiences. This results in a logic of increase, which requires a constant continuation of improvement and multiplication of resources. This is accompanied by an increasing pressure to accelerate: in order to maintain the status quo within a modern society, an increasingly rapid increase in services, innovations and material production is necessary. Rosa sees this mode of dynamic stabilization as constitutive for modernity: while pre-modern societies transform themselves adaptively, i.e. in response to changed conditions, modern society is virtually defined by its compulsion for continuous transformation. While the current phase of late modernism is characterized by a high resonance sensitivity and expectation of its subjects, the mode of dynamic stabilization results in a loss of resonance possibilities. Rosa notes three essential manifestations of the current crisis of modernity: * the ecological crisis due to the finite nature of natural resources compared to an unlimited expectation of increase * the political crisis, which arises essentially from the fact that democratic negotiation processes are too slow for the accelerated technological and resulting social changes and are therefore regarded as ineffective or obsolete, and * the psychological crisis of the subjects, which is overwhelmed by the acceleration and therefore see itself exhausted (burn-out). Resonance theory is thus in the tradition of critical theory from Marx to Adorno and Horkheimer to Habermas and Honneth. It shares the central finding of alienation as an obstacle to a successful life, but attempts to contrast this description ex negativo with a positive counter-concept, the concept of resonance. Honneth, for example, has already made this attempt with the concept of recognition. Despite all the conceded vagueness and diversity of the concept of resonance, Rosa sees this as a universal concept that includes concepts such as recognition, justice or self-efficacy.  Reception  Rosa's work and the resonance theory formulated in it are controversially received and discussed. On the one hand, the author is attested originality and the courage to analyse the fundamental issues and, in contrast to the Critical Theory often summarised with Adorno's \\"There is no right life in the wrong one\\" (\\"Es gibt kein richtiges Leben im falschen\\"), the optimistic perspective is emphasised which is oriented towards potentials for overcoming the stated crisis. Such an appreciation of resonance theory as a positive continuation of critical theory can be found with Anna Henkel. Micha Brumlik sees in the comprehensive combination of interdisciplinary strands the completion, but with it also the end, of Critical Theory, which thereby loses its \\"theoretically informed irreconcilability looking coldly at society\\". On the other hand, it is precisely this comprehensive derivation of the concept of resonance from a multitude of perspectives and contexts that is criticized to the effect that \\"resonance\\" has an almost arbitrary effect, that the concept lacks precision, and that it is therefore ultimately unsuitable as a social-philosophical basic concept, as Rosa postulates it to be. Another point of criticism refers to Rosa's alleged recourse to the intellectual world of Romanticism, to which he wanted to return without pointing the way. Rosa does indeed frequently refer to the resonance sensitivity of Romanticism even in conscious contradiction to rationalist concepts, but at the same time sees the danger of purely subjective emotion instead of resonance in the way Romanticism thinks. Thus he rather describes the continuing effect of the resonance concepts of Romanticism in modernity, without propagating a return to it. Finally, Rosa's book argues that the socio-political outlook on concrete solutions is poor and that he ultimately fails to explain how resonance can be socially established as a response to the accelerating crisis of modernity. Despite the reference to political reform proposals such as that of an unconditional basic income and emerging pilot projects of a post-growth economy, Rosa himself rejects this claim, however, because he shares \\"the question of how one could get from the social formations of 'the Middle Ages' into modernity: In both cases it is a fundamental transformation of the world relationship...\\"  References  Category:Sociological theories ","title":"Resonance (sociology)"},{"id":"58615170","text":"Georges Bayrou (21 December 1883 - 5 December 1953) was a French footballer.

He was the director of Algo Nuevo and a member of Irakere, two of the leading exponents of songo and Afro- Cuban jazz in the 1970s and 1980s. He has also directed various Cuban supergroups such as Estrellas de Areito and Cuban Masters. He has been called \\"one of the best trombone players in the Latin-jazz community of the 1990s\\". Life and career Born in Puerto Padre (former Oriente Province) on August 17, 1946, he began his musical work as euphonium player in the municipal band. Before graduating from the Escuela Nacional de Arte, Torres started his career Octavio S√°nchez Cot√°n's ensemble. In the spring of 1967 he joined the Orquesta Cubana de M√∫sica Moderna (OCMM), a large jazz ensemble directed by Armando Romeu. Soon after in the early 1970s, he directed his own group with other members of the OCMM: Los Caneyes, which created the new rhythm \\"chikichaka\\". He also started his career as a producer in EGREM, Cuba's national record label. In 1979, he was chosen as director for the Estrellas de Areito, an all- star ensemble which recorded several albums of descargas, improvised jam sessions. In 1976, he founded his own group, Grupo Algo Nuevo, recording several seminal albums of the songo genre until its dissolution in 1984. In the mid-1980s, Torres joined Irakere, which had been founded by former members of the OCMM, such as Chucho Vald√©s, Paquito D'Rivera and Arturo Sandoval. The latter two emigrated from Cuba to the United States in the 1980s, and Torres followed suit in 1992, when he decided to stay in Spain with his wife, Elsa, after the Zaragoza Conservatory offered them a teaching contract. In 1993, they relocated to the US, where he was a member of the TropiJazz All-Stars, Cuban Masters (which he directed) and the Caim√°n (Cobo Music) All Stars, three all-star ensembles similar to the Estrellas de Areito. During this time he continued to record and release solo albums, while also playing as a session musician with Bebo Vald√©s, Paquito D'Rivera, Juan Manuel Ceruto, and others. In 2002, he produced Generoso Jim√©nez's comeback album: Generoso qu√© bueno toca usted. He contributed to several soundtracks, such as Henry IV (with music by Astor Piazzolla) by Marco Bellocchio and Para que no me olvides by Patricia Ferreira. The latter was his last recording session. He died in Miami on April 17, 2005, from an inoperable brain tumor which caused him to fall into a coma. The compilation album A Life in Music was released shortly after his death. Style His style has been described as the convergence of the two trends of Cuban trombone: the traditional trend, exemplified by Generoso Jim√©nez, and the jazz trend, spearheaded by Leopoldo \\"Pucho\\" Escalante. Torres considered himself influenced by jazz, but \\"always remembering [F√©lix] Chappott√≠n\\". Awards and honours In 2002, the album Cuban Masters by Los Originales featuring Juan Pablo Torres was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Album at the 3rd Annual Latin Grammy Awards, but lost to El Arte del Sabor by Bebo Vald√©s, Cachao and Carlos \\"Patato\\" Vald√©s. The following year it was nominated for Best Tropical Latin Album along with Generoso qu√© bueno toca usted, but lost again to El Arte del Sabor.

Biography  Evseev was born in 1955. He left school after the 7th grade, and worked as a model, laboratory assistant and sailor, but always quit because he didn't like to work. In the early 1970s, Evseev was placed in a psychiatric clinic. As he later told:The first victim of the killer was a 16-year-old schoolgirl named Marina Morozova, who was dressed in red clothes. The murder was committed by Evseev in the city of Zagorsk (now Sergiyev Posad) on August 25, 1974. The following day, Evseev killed 66-year-old chef Gennady Kuzmin, stabbing him with a knife several times near the Odintsovo railway station, then robbed the corpse and threw him into a roadside ditch. Evseev stole money and a grocery order that was scarce in Soviet times - a broiler chicken and three kilograms of Bulgarian peaches. On suspicion of committing these crimes in the Kemerovo Oblast, 19-year-old Sergei Savelyev, who deserted on the eve of the first murder from the military unit, was arrested, but he failed to prove his involvement, despite the fact that he confessed to the murder of Morozova. In September 1974, in Moscow, in the park of the Palace of Culture named after the Third International, Evseev attacked student Vladimir Parshin, inflicting four knife wounds on him, but he survived. On September 24, 1974, in Moscow, in a house near the Dobryninskaya metro station, Evseev attacked and robbed Anna Astafyeva. Despite being on the verge of life and death, she was able to describe the killer; according to her, the killer was a young man with sideburns and kind eyes. Soon after, the woman died in hospital. On September 26, at the 43rd kilometer station in the Moscow Oblast, Evseev attacked a man and seriously injured him. When attacking, the killer broke his knife and the blade was left stuck in the victim's back, who died later in hospital. The murdered man, who looked very similar to Evseev, was 42-year-old Nikolai Dyomin, who had spent almost 20 years in prison. As it later turned out, Evseev committed the murder with the aim of confusing the tracks by putting his clothes on the man. Initially, the investigators even thought it was Dyomin who committed all the robberies and murders. On October 8, 1974, in the Tagansky District of Moscow, Evseev made three robbery attacks at once. Two of the three women robbed by him died from the knife wounds, and all of them wore red dresses. Panic began in Moscow, with people saying that the \\"Killer of women in red\\" had appeared. On October 15, in the area of the Akademicheskaya metro station, at intervals of 20 minutes, Evseev committed two more attacks on girls, one of them dying from the wounds received. On October 16, in the area of the Proletarskaya metro station, Evseev again made a double attack, killing one of the victims. But this time neither victim was wearing red clothes. After this, Evseev committed a series of robberies in Moscow and the surrounding region, but all victims survived and described the killer the same way. In connection with the panic in Moscow, the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR decided on unprecedented measures, the Minister of Internal Affairs Nikolai Shchelokov spoke on television, warning the citizens to be cautious. This frightened Evseev, who ceased his attacks for almost two years. In November 1976, Evseev committed four robberies in a month, two of which ended in murder. In the fall of 1977, Evseev hit the secretary-typist of the Central Committee of the CPSU Nina Dalinjan on the head with a screwdriver, but she survived. The apotheosis of the criminal activity of the killer was the brutal murder of Lydia Kupriyanova, the wife of Soviet artist , member of famous artist trio known as \\"Kukryniksy\\". This time, for the first time, the killer raped the victim posthumously. Two months later, on December 19, 1977, in front of dozens of people in the backyard of the \\"Housewares\\" store in the village of Sofrino, he committed another murder. He took the watch, money, jewelry and a dog collar from the murdered Lydia Schur, raping her corpse afterwards. = Arrest, trial and sentence = A witness to the last murder reported that he had seen a suspicious man in a corduroy jacket at the crime scene. The local drinking company said that with them appeared a certain Shahnov, dressed in the velvet jacket. The jacket, on which there were blood stains and a knife was in one of the pockets, was later found. However, when Shahnov was arrested, he reported that another man had given him that jacket, with subsequent examination confirming the man's testimony. Another witness said that he had seen a stranger on a train in Khotkovo, and that he was wearing a railwayman's uniform. When the database was picked up and according to it were selected suitable matches, 22-year-old criminal Andrei Evseev came up as a result. On December 28, 1977 the killer was arrested. On this day he had dressed the New Years tree with jewels stolen from the victims. When they came for him, he hid the jewels, and there was nothing suspicious in Evseev's apartment, except for the dog collar stolen from the last victim. He explained that he kept it hidden as a memory of his beloved dog. At first he refused to give evidence, but on December 31, on New Year's Eve, while conversing with a cellmate, he dropped a strange phrase: \\"My mother, I suppose, already baked pies with jewels.\\" The cellmate turned out to be an informant, and the investigators guessed that the stolen jewelry was hidden in a bag of flour. The conjecture was confirmed during the second search of Evseev's apartment. During the interrogations, Evseev was defiant and refused to communicate with the female investigator. He agreed to testify only after he was brought salted herring, which he ate entirely with bones. Subsequently, he confessed to 9 murders, 18 attempted murders, one rape and 32 robberies. As a result of forensic psychiatric examination Evseev was declared as mentally competent to stand trial, but at the same time diagnosed with \\"sociopathy\\". While waiting for the court, Evseev took care about himself, and did exercises every morning. The killer felt no remorse for his deeds, claiming that he despised those who work and live \\"from salary to salary.\\" In 1979, the court sentenced Andrei Evseev to death, and he was soon executed by firing squad.

Ayatollah Khomeini was invited back to Iran by the government,and returned to Tehran from exile on 1979.1979: Exiled Ayatollah Khomeini returns to Iran  bbc.co.uk On 4 November 1964, Khomeini was secretly taken to Ankara and then to Bursa, Turkey. On 5 September 1965, he moved to Najaf, Iraq and stayed there until Saddam Hussein deported him. Finally, he was exiled by the pressure of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to Neauphle-le-Ch√¢teau, Paris on 6 October 1978. Political activity before exile Khomeini with people In 1944 Khomeini published his first book, Kashf al-Asrar (‚ÄúSecrets Unveiled‚Äù), attacking secularisation under Reza Shah Pahlavi and advocating for the power of Allah to establish and disestablish governments.Vahdat, Farzin; God and Juggernaut: Iran's Intellectual Encounter With Modernity, p. 182 After the death of Borujerdi in 1961, Khomeini became the leading Marja'. In January 1963, the Shah announced the White Revolution, a six-point program of reform calling for land reform, nationalization of the forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office, profit-sharing in industry, and a literacy campaign in the nation's schools. On the other hand, he and many religious leaders considered the revolution had trends of westernizing the country and would in their mind threaten the traditional Islamic lifestyle of the common folk. The Shah himself traveled to Qom and announced the clergy black reactionaries worse than the red reactionaries and a hundred times more treacherous than the (communist) tudeh party during his speech. On 26th January 1963, he held a referendum to get the appearance of public support in which 5.6 million against 4.1 people vote for the reformation. The referendum was a good excuse for the government to take tougher practical action against the clergy and on 22nd March 1963, coincides with the death-day of Ja'far al- Sadiq, the Shah's guards attacked Feyziyeh Schooland kill students and people. According to Daniel Brumberg, the regime persuaded the thugs to attack the students of Feyziyeh School. On the afternoon of Ashura (3 June 1963), Khomeini presented a lecture at the Feyziyeh School and inculpated the Shah as a \\"wretched miserable man\\", advised him to change his ways, otherwise the day will come that people will be happy to see him leave, drawing parallels to the caliph Yazid, who is perceived as a 'tyrant' by Shias. On 5 June 1963 at 3 am, two days after, Khomeini was detained and transferred to Tehran. When this news was broadcast, large protest demonstrations were held in Qom, Tehran, Mashhad, Varamin, Kashan and other cities. The Shah's guards killed and injured several people. That event is now referred to as the Movement of 15 Khordad. On 3 August, the Shah released Khomeini from jail and placed him under house arrest. On 26 October 1964, Khomeini condemned the Shah because of the diplomatic immunity he granted to American citizens, civilian or military personnel in Iran. On 4 November 1964 Khomeini was arrested by SAVAK. He was then taken to Mehrabad international airport in Tehran and sent to Turkey. Life in exile Khomeini in exile at Bursa, Turkey without clerical dress =Turkey= A week after his arrival in Turkey, Khomeini was sent to Bursa and he stayed there for eleven months. He was hosted by a colonel in the Turkish Military intelligence named Ali Cetiner in his own residence. According to Turkish law, clerical dress was banned and Khomeini was never allowed to meet people. On 3 December 1964, his son, Mostafa, joined him. In his first days in Turkey, Khomeini was extremely angry at the secular dress of Turkish women, but he learned to adapt quickly to his new surroundings.Willett, Edward; Ayatollah Khomeini, p. 48 Despite the bans on contact with Khomeini, he and his students ‚Äì most notably future President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani ‚Äì would plot the successful assassination of Prime Minister Hassan-Ali Mansur as soon as Khomeini left Iran. In Bursa, Khomeini possessed a great deal of spare time, with the result that he continued his studies and for the first time moved away from the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù view of clerical involvement in politics.Rahimi, Babak; Contentious Legacies of the Ayatollah, in Adib-Moghaddam, Arshin (editor); A Critical Introduction to Khomeini, p. 296 He wrote his second book, Tahrir al-Wasilah, and began to receive huge donations from Iranian supporters who already opposed the Shah‚Äôs policies. The extent of donations to the Ayatollah caused the Shah and Turkish government to lift the ban on communication with his during the summer of 1965, and several clergy visited Khomeini ‚Äì who was wearing secular garb ‚Äì in Istanbul in 1965. On September 5, 1965, Khomeini left Turkey and went to Najaf in Iraq. The reasons for Khomeini's exile to Najaf by the Shah's regime are described as: # The regime hoped to diminish the role of Khomeini through competition with Iraqi Ulama like Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei # Because of intense pressure and popular protests. # Scholars and Khomeini's followers began to communicate with him in Bursa, donating so much money that the Ayatollah went from virtually penniless to very rich # A SAVAK agent thought that his presence made the Turkish people hostile toward the Shah‚Äôs regime. =Iraq= Rouhollah Khomeini in exile, Najaf, Pilgrimage the shrine of Imam Ali On 8 September 1965, Khomeini entered Iraq and would spend thirteen years there. Iraq did not have good political relations with the Shah. Khomeini and Mostafa entered Iraq. He went to Kadhimiya and stayed in the company of Mohammad al- Husayni al-Shirazi for two days before going to Karbala. From there he went to the city of Najaf. Initially, Khomeini was isolated by Iraq‚Äôs Shi'a clergy because of his status as a foreigner and his radical teachings and support for terrorismZahed, Mosa; The Evolution and Ascension of Iran‚Äôs Terror Apparatus, in Casaca, Paulo and Wolf, Siegfried O. (editors); Terrorism Revisited: Islamism, Political Violence and State-Sponsorship, p. 67 ; however, after a while Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr and other Iraqi clerics would join with Khomeini because they shared similar aims in establishing an Islamic state. Khomeini would also be helped in his first days in Iraq by then-President Abdul Salam Arif, who allowed the Ayatollah to set up and control an Iranian opposition radio station. After a while, his wife Khadijeh Saqafi and second son Ahmad Khomeini joined them in Najaf. Khomeini began teaching Fiqh in the Sheikh Morteza Ansari Madrassah which captivated students mainly from Iran, Iraq, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Persian Gulf states. In April 1967, Khomeini wrote the two letters, once to Ulama in order to persuade them to attempt to overthrow the Shah's regime and another to Amir-Abbas Hoveyda, protesting the coronation of the ShahDabashi, Hamid; Theology of Discontent: The Ideological Foundation of the Islamic Revolution, p. lix and condemning him for continued violation of both Islam and the constitution.Algar, Hamid; Roots of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Also, Khomeini forbade any type of dealing with Israel. Four years into his Iraqi exile, between 21 January and 8 February (1970), Khomeini gave lectures about Vilayat-e Faqƒ´h ya Hukumat-i Islami, which in Shia Islam hold that Islam gives a faqƒ´h (Islamic jurist) custodianship over people.Islam and Revolution (1981), pp. 29‚Äì30. This became Khomeini‚Äôs most famous and influential work, and laid out his ideas on governance (at that time): * That the laws of society should be made up only of the laws of God (Sharia), which cover \\"all human affairs\\" and \\"provide instruction and establish norms\\" for every \\"topic\\" in \\"human life.\\" * Since Shariah, or Islamic law, is the proper law, those holding government posts should have knowledge of Sharia. Since Islamic jurists or faqƒ´h have studied and are the most knowledgeable in Sharia, the country's ruler should be a faqƒ´h who \\"surpasses all others in knowledge\\" of Islamic law and justice,Islam and Revolution (1981), p. 59. (known as a marja'), as well as having intelligence and administrative ability. Rule by monarchs and/or assemblies of \\"those claiming to be representatives of the majority of the people\\" (i.e. elected parliaments and legislatures) has been proclaimed \\"wrong\\" by Islam.Islam and Revolution, (1981), p. 31, 56 * This system of clerical rule is necessary to prevent injustice, corruption, oppression by the powerful over the poor and weak, innovation and deviation of Islam and Sharia law; and also to destroy anti-Islamic influence and conspiracies by non-Muslim foreign powers.Islam and Revolution (1981), p. 54. The theory in Shia Islam which holds that Islam gives a faqƒ´h (Islamic jurist) custodianship over people. To formed an Islamic government, Two things were needed: # Overthrow of the Shah # Establishment of Shi'i theocracy Khomeini had mooted this theory as early as the middle 1940s in his first book Kashf al-Asrar. From 1971 to 1975, Khomeini demonstrated vehement opposition to the 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire, and the changing of the Iranian calendar from Hijri to Imperial (Shahanshahi). During this era, the Shah considered exiling Khomeini, now known as the ‚ÄúImam‚Äù, to India, because he believed doing so would make communication between the Imam and his followers in Iran impossible, but for an unrevealed reason this plan was never executed. Khomeini was also faced with hostility from the Ba'ath regime, which began so hostile to his brand of Islam as the Shah.Bernhardt, Florian; ‚ÄòFirm conviction or forced belief? The Islamic Da‚Äòwah Party‚Äôs response to Khomeini‚Äôs theory of wilayat al-faqih‚Äô; International Journal of Contemporary Iraqi Studies, Volume 6, Number 3, 1 September 2012, pp. 299-314 In November 1977, the Shah's overthrow began with the assassination of Khomeini's son, Mostafa, by SAVAK.

Mohammad Ayatollahi Tabaar; Religious Statecraft. p. 66 On October 11, 1978, after Khomeini was moved to Neauphle-le-Ch√¢teau outside Paris, France. From the advantages this decision was to keep faraway clerics and Ulama. Citiation in Frances such as some communication facilities and political atmosphere make more efficient relation with people in Iran. In France, because of journalists and the press, Khomeini's speeches were published rapidly in global media. Khomeini wanted to people that continued protests against the government.Moin, Khomeini, (2000), p. 203 Between August and December 1978, strikes and demonstrations paralyzed Iran, so that the Shah left the country for exile on 16 January 1979, as the last Persian monarch, leaving his duties to a regency council and an opposition-based prime minister, Shapour Bakhtiar. Return from exile On Thursday, 1 February 1979, Ruhollah Khomeini was invited back to Iran by the government and returned to Iran.

Lee works in the areas of cyber-physical systems, embedded systems, and the semantics of programming languages. He is particularly known for his advocacy of deterministic models for the engineering of cyber-physical systems. Lee has led the Ptolemy Project, which has created Ptolemy II, an open-source model based design and simulation tool. He ghost-edited a book about this software, where the editor of record is Claudius Ptolemaeus, the 2nd century Greek astronomer, mathematician, and geographer. The Kepler scientific workflow system is based on Ptolemy II. From 2005 to 2008 Lee was chair of the Electrical Engineering Division and then chair of the EECS Department at UC Berkeley. He has led a number of large research projects at Berkeley, including the Center for Hybrid and Embedded Software Systems (CHESS), the TerraSwarm Research Center, and the Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems Research Center (iCyPhy). Lee has written several textbooks, covering subjects including embedded systems, digital communications, and signals and systems. He has also written a general-audience book, Plato and the Nerd: The Creative Partnership of Humans and Technology, where he argues that humans are coevolving with technology in a Darwinian way. Biography Lee was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1957. His father, a prominent businessman and later a bankruptcy lawyer, was a descendant of notable Puerto Ricans Alejandro Tapia y Rivera, a poet and playwright, and Bailey Ashford, a pioneering physician in the treatment of tropical anemia. His mother was originally from Kentucky, but moved around the country many times following her career Army father, Charles P.

Nicholas went on to serve as a member of the original organizing team for national Central Intelligence, and later moved to West Point, where he became head of the Math Department at the United States Military Academy. At age 14, Lee left home to attend the Lawrenceville School, a boarding school in New Jersey. From there he went to Yale University, where he flitted between majors before settling on a double major in Computer Science and Engineering and Applied Science.Lee, \\"Plato and the Nerd\\" p. 279. In 1979, Lee was hired by Bell Labs, which paid for him to go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a Science Masters (SM) in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1980. He then moved back to New Jersey to work at the Bell Labs Holmdel Complex, where he met his future wife, Rhonda Righter. At Bell Labs, Lee worked on the world's first software-defined modem. In 1982, Lee returned to school to get a PhD in the EECS Department at UC Berkeley. In 1986, he finished his PhD and was hired to the faculty at Berkeley, where he has been ever since. In 2018, Lee retired from teaching to focus full-time on research and writing.

She writes novels, essays and books for children and youth as well as academic works. Most of her works have been assessed as Oulipian. Biography Jasna Horvat was on born 27 December 1966 in Osijek. She studied at the Faculty of Economics, University of Osijek, where she graduated (1989) and was employed as an assistant at the Department of Cybernetics, Mathematics and Statistics (1990). Following the completion of her postgraduate studies, she obtained her master's degree (January 23, 1992) from the Faculty of Economics in Osijek, and she earned her doctoral degree (26 May 1997) also from the Faculty of Economics in Osijek by defending her dissertation before a committee which included her advisor, as well as an international member, Anu≈°ka Ferligoj, a full professor at the University of Ljubljana. She has headed several scientific projects. One such project was the development of the CATI Center, a research platform for collecting, analyzing and interpreting statistical data. She has participated in numerous scientific conferences in the fields of social sciences and the humanities and has been a recipient of international scholarships and an invited lecturer. In 2012, she was appointed scientific adviser and attained the position of full professor with tenure in the scientific area of social sciences, in the field of economics, in the branch of quantitative economics. She is also the founder and vice president of Andizet - Institute for Scientific and Artistic Research in the Creative Industry. Literary work She is a member of the Society of Croatian Writers, the Croatian Association of Researchers of Children's Literature,http://www.hidk.hr Matica hrvatska and the Croatian Statistical Society. Her literary work started through a collaboration with the Children's Theater Branko Mihaljeviƒá in Osijek in the late 1990s. At that time, the Drama Studio of the children's theater was staging the play ‚ÄúPutem sunca‚Äù, which was later renamed ‚ÄúSvevidovim tragom‚Äù (Tracing Svevid) and appeared in ‚ÄúIzgubljena vila (Lost Fairy), a book of two dramatized texts published by Matica hrvatska in 2002. After the Lost Fairy, in 2005, Naklada Ljevak published Alemperkina kazivanja (Gemfeather‚Äôs Sayings) - her interpretation of the mythology of Suƒçiƒá with superb illustrations by Pika Vonƒçina. The book of letters exchanged with Irena Vrkljan Pismo u pismu (A Letter in a Letter), (Naklada Ljevak, 2008) is a confirmation of a friendship revived through letters, as well as a showcase of the cultural versatility of both authors. The novels ' (Naklada Ljevak, 2009), Bizarij (The Bizarrium), (Naklada Ljevak, 2009), ' (Naklada Ljevak, 2011), Vilikon (Naklada Ljevak, 2012), Alikvot (Algoritam, 2014), Vilijun (Naklada Ljevak, 2016), Atanor (Naklada Ljevak, 2017) and OSvojski (Naklada Ljevak, 2019) point to Jasna Horvat's penchant for experiments manifested primarily in the conceptualization of the novelistic form. Her works for children - Izgubljena vila (Lost Fairy) (Matica hrvatska, 2002.), Alemperkina kazivanja (Gemfeather‚Äôs Sayings), (Naklada Ljevak, 2005) and Krijesnici(The Bonfires), (Algoritam, 2009) ‚Äì thematize the mythological concept of the Croatian Pantheon, adapt it to children, and through the illustrations of Pika Vonƒçina they become easily remembered traditions. In the novel Az (2009), which received the prestigious award for literature from the Croatian Academy of Arts and Sciences (2010), Jasna Horvat popularizes the Glagolitic script by incorporating it into the plot of a novel on a lexical, numerical and symbolic level. Bizarij (The Bizarrium) - a novel about the phantasmagoria of connectedness - Jasna Horvat uses conjunctions to point to the grammatical codification of intimate and historical attachments to topos. In this case, the city of Osijek is chosen for its topos and the famous bizarre former residents of Osijek are the bearers of the symbolic correspondence with the conjunctions as a part of speech. The conceptual variations of this author culminate in ' where the golden ratio is built not only into the text structure but also into the life of the novel's main protagonist Auron. Captions in the margins of the novel are filled with details about the auron concept of beauty and thereby, with captions in the margins, ' readers receive a wealth of information about the golden ratio format - auron ‚Äì as well as its most diverse occurrences. The lexicon novel of the fairies - Vilikon, is a mixture of two cultural stories: one narrated by Marco Polo and one interpreted by Kubla Khan, Marco's listener. The lexicon entries of the fairies, supernatural beings of the Kingdom of Croatia, are told by the use of a magic square of 12. The novel Alikvot is built on the study of Vladimir Ma≈æuraniƒá and in its contents completes an unfinished novel by Ivana Brliƒá Ma≈æuraniƒá Ja≈°a Dalmatin, potkralj Gud≈æerata. This novel also brings The Manifesto of Axiomatic Literature by which the writer clarifies the doctrine on which she based her opus. The author Jasna Horvat is completely dedicated to the fostering, research and promotion of the Croatian cultural heritage. She sees herself as determined by the information age, while critics compare her works with the works of Italo Calvino and often assess them as Oulipian narratives.https://www.academia.edu/4426681/A_Conceptual_Mnemotope_of_Osijek_in_Jasna_Horvats_Novel_Bizarij. Since 2012, she has been a member of the committee for the Dr. Ivan ≈†reter Award, an annual Croatian linguistics award for the best Croatian language word coined. She has presented Croatian Literature at the inaugural launch of the EU-China International Literary Festival which was held in 2017 in Beijing and Chengdu. With her associates, she has published a bilingual publication Ars Andizetum, which is available also through open access and offers a new definition of the Creative Industry.

Biography  Almazyan was born on May 5, 1950 in Rostov-on-Don in an Armenian family. During his childhood, in parallel with studying at school, he was engaged in freestyle wrestling, having mastered the stifling techniques which he would later use on his victims. In 1968, he graduated from school and entered a technical school, working as a loader. It was at this time that there was a psychological breakdown of his character - a girl to whom he expected to lose his virginity, preferred another man instead of him. = Crimes = Since early 1969, Almazyan began to attack women who conducted the same scenario - he put a knife to the victim's face and said that she had lost in cards, then would take them to a secluded place and rape the victim. During the third attack, Almazyan lost a student card in his name, but managed to convince officers who were investigating the rapes that it was not him. However, frightened that he might be captured, he went to the military commissariat and asked to serve in the Soviet Army. Almazyan served in one of the military units in Voroshilovgrad, looking after a pigsty. This post allowed him to avoid vigilant control by the command and get the opportunity to go on unauthorized absences. On March 26, 1970, he made his first attack in Voroshilovgrad, and in the next 2 weeks - 5 more attacks. Seeing the serial nature of his crimes, the leadership of the regional police department sent reinforced police patrols and druzhinas to the streets, amassing a number of about 300 people. Fearing capture, Almazyan began to commit crimes in the most deserted areas of the city. On April 14, 1970, Almazyan committed his first murder. He bound the hands of 17-year-old Svetlana Mazurina and plugged her mouth with a piece of wafer towel, raping and strangling her afterwards. As a \\"trophy\\", he took away the victim's gold jewelry. On May 16, 1970, while trying to rape one of the girls who played the role \\"bait\\" for the maniac, a certain Vitaly Vlasov was detained. He confessed to a number of rapes he committed between 1966 and 1970 (a total of 22 rapes were proven), but refuse to plead guilty for the murders. Subsequently, Vlasov was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. Soon, also, when attempting to rape a 13-year-old girl, another alleged maniac was detained, but he was not the same killer. An anonymous letter came to the police, the author of which claimed to know who the killer was, but this information went unconfirmed after a check. On July 4, 1970, Almazyan committed the murder-rape of 17-year-old Nina Zaikova, leaving a fragment of the newspaper \\"Rural Life\\" at the crime scene. On August 6, 1970 he attacked 20-year-old Olga Serova while she was returning home from work, but the intervention of a passer-by forced him to flee. On September 22, 1970, Almazyan made another unsuccessful attack, again fleeing from casual passers-by. At the crime scene, he left a scrap of sheet on which there was a stamp from the military unit. However, the investigation failed to take advantage of this because of an error in the examination, which determined the half-eroded figures incorrectly. And on October 27, 1970, Almazyan raped and murdered 20-year-old Larisa Rogova, stealing her earring and a red sweater. On the night of November 7 to 8, he attacked a woman in the city parks, but a group of volunteers, who were nearby, rushed after him in pursuit. As a result of combing the park, Almazyan and five other suspicious men were detained, but one of the maniac's surviving victims managed to identify him. = Trial = Almazyan soon confessed to all his crimes in Rostov-on-Don and Voroshilovgrad. During the subsequent search, all the stolen things from the raped and murdered women were found in his shed. In total, he committed 3 murders and 12 rapes. The visiting section of the Military Tribunal of the Kiev Military District sentenced Zaven Almazyan to death. The Supreme Court of the Soviet Union left the verdict unchanged. In 1973, he was executed by firing squad.

Daniel Warth of Ha'ir, while noticing similarities to the works of Pier Paolo Pasolini, Bertolt Brecht, and Mikl√≥s Jancs√≥, stated that the film \\"is an artistic pretension which remains nothing but an aesthical drill with unsophisticated political declarations.\\" References ;Citations in article ;Sources used *.

For 5 years he was the adjutant of the Cadet Corps No. 1 in Lviv;Year 1932, p. 808. in turn ‚Äì until the outbreak of the war ‚Äì he was an ordnance officer of Brigadier General Micha≈Ç Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski, commander of the Corps District No. VI in Lviv, and from 1938 commander of the Corps District No. VIII in Toru≈Ñ. During the September Campaign in 1939, Kumor took part in the Battle of the Bzura, and then, along with General Tokarzewski and a group of a dozen or so officers, he managed to get into besieged Warsaw. As a member of General Tokarzewski's staff, he took an active part in forming the first underground resistance organization in the country: The Service for Poland's Victory. Later, with the creation of the Union of Armed Struggle (later known as the Home Army), he held positions of responsibility in Branch I, and then in Division VII of the Home Army Headquarters. During this period, he directed the Legalization Department and organized a network of hideouts and safe houses in Warsaw. He arranged, among other things, the lodgings of General Stefan Rowecki ‚Äì ‚ÄúGrot‚Äù ‚Äì the commander of the Home Army. In 1942 he was appointed major. In the same year, he initiated, and a year later organized, the famous Operation ‚ÄúG√≥ral‚Äù under the direct supervision of general ‚ÄúGrot‚Äù. This action involved a heist of over a million US dollars' worth of currency being transported by Nazi German authorities on August 12, 1943. It was carried out in the center of Warsaw by a Kedyw \\"Motor\\" unit, which seized a transport car carrying the money. It was one of the best organized actions by the Polish underground during the German occupation. During the Warsaw Uprising (August 1 ‚Äì October 3, 1944), Kumor was the inspector of the combat section in the city center. During that time, he organized an insurgent grenade factory and contributed to the detection and protection of large grain stocks in Haberbusch's warehouses, later used to feed the fighters of Warsaw. After the fall of the Uprising, Kumor was taken prisoner by the Germans and placed in the Oflag II-C prisoner-of-war camp. After the release of Polish prisoners of war by the Soviet army in January 1945, he returned and reported to the ranks of the Polish Army. Initially, he was deputy commander of the 41st infantry regiment in Goleni√≥w, later he was appointed commander of the 62nd infantry regiment stationed in Skierniewice, and then in E≈Çk, where he took an active part in the reconstruction of damaged areas, gaining recognition from the local society. In 1946, due to poor health, he retired at his own request. In 1949, he was arrested and imprisoned for political reasons and released in 1953 after the investigation was discontinued. After his release, Kumor devoted himself to journalistic work, publishing a number of articles in magazines about the activities of the Polish resistance during the occupation. His book, A Clipping From the History of One Life, was re- published by Platan in 2011. Kumor died suddenly on December 28, 1957, from heart problems.

He died on the island after less than six months. Background Jean du Plessis was a gentleman from Picardy. He was the seigneur d‚ÄôOssonville, an advocate in Dieppe and a distant relative of Cardinal Richelieu (Armand Jean du Plessis). The French adventurers Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc and Urbain Du Roissey reached Saint Christopher Island (Saint Kitts) in 1625, and were struck by the potential of the island as a colony once the indigenous Island Caribs were removed. They returned to France and in 1626 with the support of Cardinal Richelieu founded the \\"Association des Seigneurs de la Compagnie des Isles de l‚ÄôAm√©rique\\". The private venture had the mandate to settle Saint Christophe, Barbados and other neighboring islands at the entrance to Peru that were not possessed by any king or Christian prince. They engaged over 500 men to work on the islands for three years, sailed in three ships in February 1627, and after a difficult crossing landed in Saint-Christophe almost three months later. The first French settlers suffered from famine and fought with the Caribs and the English, who also had a settlement on the island. Richelieu sent a squadron of six ships commanded by Admiral Fran√ßois de Rotondy, seigneur de Cussac (or Cahuzac) to assist the settlers. Jean du Plessis travelled with this fleet. The fleet arrived at Saint-Christophe at the end of August 1629, defeated the English, reestablished d'Esnambuc and the French settlers in their settlements, and left for France. However, in November 1629 the Spanish admiral Federico de Toledo chased the French from the island. They left on two ships and attempted colonization of Antigua and Montserrat. They returned to Saint-Christophe in 1630. In 1634 d'Esnambuc and his lieutenant Charles Li√®nard de l'Olive decided to colonize other islands, and sent an exploratory expedition to Martinique, Dominica and Guadeloupe under Guillaume d'Orange, who reported that Guadeloupe seemed the easiest to settle. Spanish attempts to colonize the Guadeloupe archipelago in the first half of the 16th century had failed, and since then European sailors had only used it as a resting place. Guadeloupe expedition 1759 map. Fort St. Peter (Saint- Pierre) is shown on the northern point of 240px L'Olive left for Paris in 1634 to obtain permission from the Compagnie des √Æsles d'Am√©rique to settle Guadeloupe. He met Jean Du Plessis, sieur d'Ossonville in Dieppe, who agreed to join his project. The relationship between Du Plessis and Cardinal Richelieu may have been a factor. The two men went on to Paris to negotiate with the Company. They signed a treaty with the company in February 1635 in which they engaged to take 200 men to settle Dominica, Martinique or Guadeloupe. Under the contract the Company would provide arms, ammunition and the protection of the government. L'Olive and Du Plessis would have settled at least 800 men after ten years, not counting women and children. They would pay a petun (tobacco) fee, and at the end of the contract the settlements, forts and dwellings would all become property of the company. The contract, signed on 14 February 1635, commissioned l'Olive and Du Plessis to \\"command together on the island they would inhabit.\\" The two founders could not pay all the expenses, so brought in the merchants of Dieppe in exchange for a share of the profits over six years. The merchants had to supply them with 2,500 men. The settlers left Dieppe on 25 May 1635 with 554 people, including four Dominican missionaries. There were 40 Norman families of peasant origin, 30 prostitutes from the port of Dieppe or Paris, and 400 hired laborers. Those who paid for their voyage would be given concessions to grow tobacco or sugar in the island, which they would work using slaves from Africa and hired hands from France. The allou√©s (allocated people) could not pay for their trip, but were on contract to work for three years. The people hired to cultivate the islands were nicknamed trente-six mois (36 months) after the term they were forced to serve. They would be treated, beaten and sold as slaves. However, some of them would later obtain concessions. Jean Fran√ßois du Buc, who would be Governor of Grenada from 1658 to 1660, was a leading member of the expedition, as was Constant d'Aubign√©, father of Fran√ßoise d'Aubign√©, Marquise de Maintenon. The expedition sailed in two ships. One, with 400 men, carried l‚ÄôOlive, Duplessis and two of the Dominicans, and the other carried 150 men and the other two Dominicans. They reached Martinique on 25 June 1635, which they claimed for the king, then moved on because they found the island \\"cut by precipices and gullies and infested with poisonous snakes\\". Settlement of Guadeloupe Sugar cane plantation on Guadeloupe The ships made a very fast passage to Guadeloupe, where they disembarked on 28 or 29 June 1635. The landing point was near Pointe-All√®gre (Sainte-Rose). L'Olive established himself west of Pointe All√®gre on the banks of what became the Vieux-Fort river, so called because Fort Saint-Pierre was built there. Du Plessis made his base east of Pointe All√®gre and built a small fort on the river that became called Petit- Fort river. No traces of these forts remain, but an old map shows their position. The governors went to Saint Christophe for six weeks. Two weeks after they arrived d‚ÄôEsnambuc sent colonists to settle in Martinique. Pointe- All√®gre proved to be a poor location, and many settlers died from sickness or starvation. The survivors moved to the south of the island beside the present Vieux-Fort. The Caribs helped them fell trees, sow the land, make canoes and fish for turtles and manatees. However, acting against the advice of Du Plessis, l'Olive decided to attack the Caribs and take their food and women. Jean du Plessis seems to have been gentle, human and prudent, and broke with the more brutal Charles de l'Olive. Du Plessis embarked for France with Jean Fran√ßois du Buc late in 1635 after the Compagnie de Saint-Christophe had been ruined. He died on 4 December 1635, apparently on the return boat.

Having fallen ill at the end of 1898, he blessed to perform the sacrament of anointing on himself, and, having communicated sacred secrets, on 5 December, at 2:40 am, quietly and peacefully died. The funeral services were headed by Archbishop of Finland . He was buried in the Isidorovskaya Church of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra (closed in 1932). The funeral dinner was given at the lavra's refectory from the two sons of the deceased. One of his sons ‚Äì Nikolai Raev ‚Äì later became the last Chief Procurator of the Most Holy Synod of Tsarist Time. In 1932, his remains were transferred to the Brotherhood Cemetery of the Lavra.

Early life Otis was born in New York City on October 12, 1836, as a member of the prominent Boston Brahmin Otis family. He was the son of James William Otis (1800‚Äì1869) and Martha (n√©e Church) Otis. His elder brother was William Church Otis, who married Margaret Sigourney (their daughter Violet was married to William Greenough Thayer). He was the grandson of Harrison Gray Otis, a U.S. Senator and U.S. Representative from Massachusetts who was one of the wealthiest men of Boston during his time, and a great-grandson of Samuel Allyne Otis, a delegate from Massachusetts to the Second Continental Congress who served as the Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the 1st Secretary of the United States Senate. He was also the granduncle of Sigourney Thayer, the theatrical producer, and Robert Helyer Thayer, the U.S. Minister to Romania under Dwight D. Eisenhower. Career During the U.S. Civil War, Otis was a member of the Union Army, achieving the rank of colonel with the 22nd New York Regiment. He began his career working as an East Indian commission broker. In 1878, he was an unsuccessful candidate to represent New York's 1st District in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1883, he was elected as a Republican to represent New York's 1st Senate District (comprising Queens and Suffolk counties) in the New York State Senate during the 107th and 108th New York State Legislatures, which was during the second and third year of Grover Cleveland's governorship. During his time in the Legislature, he served alongside cousin Norton P. Otis, who represented Westchester County in the Assembly. Norton later represented New York's 19th congressional district in the House of Representatives. =Society life= In 1892, the widower Otis and several of his relatives, including his unmarried daughter Sarah and grand-nephew J. Wadsworth Ritchie, were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Otis, who spent his summers in Newport, Rhode Island, was a member of the Union League and Seawanhaka Yacht Club, and was known for many years a famous cotillion leader, bon vivant and raconteur. Personal life Otis was married to Mary Adelia Ludlum (d. 1890), daughter of Nicholas Ludlum. They had a large country home and estate in Bellport on Long Island known as \\"Near-the-Bay\\" and a home in New York City at 22 East 10th Street near Tompkins Square Park. Together, they were the parents of: * Mary Ludlum \\"May\\" Otis (1866‚Äì1946), who married Robert R. Livingston Clarkson (1855‚Äì1924), the son of Levinus Clarkson and Mary (n√©e Livingston) Clarkson (daughter of Lt. Gov. of New York Edward Philip Livingston), on November 6, 1886. * James Otis Jr., who predeceased his father. * Martha Otis, who married banker George Munroe, and lived in Paris and married in 1889. * Sarah Birdsall \\"Birdsall\\" Otis (1872‚Äì1940), an active campaigner for women's suffrage and the Girl Scouts of the USA (of which she served as president from 1930 until 1935). She married Frederick Edey, a member of the New York Stock Exchange, in 1893. Otis died from congestion of the lungs on July 22, 1898, at his home in Bellport on Long Island. His funeral was held at Christ Chapel in Bellport and he was interred in the family vault in the Bellport Cemetery. =Descendants= Through his daughter Mary, he was the grandfather of James Otis Clarkson (1888‚Äì1951), Mary Adelia Clarkson (1889‚Äì1976), Pauline Livingston Clarkson (1892‚Äì1983), and Elizabeth Clarkson (1896‚Äì1956).

It is a variant form of epigenetics, proposed by American psychologist Gilbert Gottlieb in 1991. Gottlieb‚Äôs model is based on Conrad H. Waddington's idea of developmental epigenesis. Both theories examine the complexity of the ways in which the brain develops and explore factors that occur outside the genome. However, probabilistic epigenesis differs from Waddington‚Äôs model as it relies much more heavily on the potential developmental impacts of experience and environment and how they interact with an individual‚Äôs genes. Probabilistic epigenesis takes into account developmental, hormonal, environmental, neuropsychological, and genetic factors in order to explain various forms of behavior.  In developmental psychology  In developmental psychology, probabilistic epigenesis is a theory of human behavior that assumes that different neural structures develop and activate either based on an individual's biology or interactions with their environment. It relies on the idea that there are multi-directional interactions between biological and psychological factors, meaning probabilistic epigenesis is a non-hierarchical model of understanding development. The biological factors, also known as genetic determinants, involve an individual's genetic makeup, and how it influences their behavior. These factors must be looked at alongside environment variables, however, as the number of genes in a human brain is insufficient in regards to explaining all aspects of the human mind‚Äìthere is simply not enough storage. According to the theory of probabilistic epigenesis, the environment (socioeconomic, household, etc.) in which a person lives and interacts with contributes to overall behavioral development by triggering certain genetic information to activate. = Socioeconomic environment = The relationship between socioeconomically disadvantaged youth and poor physical health is a topic notably evaluated by James Hamblin. Research has proven there is a correlation between disadvantaged youth and high blood pressure, excess body fat, and high levels of cortisol. The pressures associated with a low socioeconomic background have proven to produce chronic stress in individuals who strive for upward mobility, likely due to the increased familial and social pressures. Subsequently, chronic stress has been linked to a break down in bodily functions, and is thus a stimulant for disease. In other words, this means that the extrinsic factor of socioeconomic class can cause an individual to be less physically capable of handling stress and heavy workloads than someone born into a wealthier environment. This means that their self-control and work ethic comes with the price of their health, as people from low socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to age faster at the cellular level. = Household environment = An unpredictable and chaotic household structure can be linked to socioemotional development. Socioemotional development, if occurring in an environment that lacks a regular pattern, can result in behavioral difficulties and symptoms of internalization. An example of this can be seen in a study conducted by Urie Bronfenbrenner, in which he examines how the exchange of energy between the developing child and the persons and objects in their close settings effects their development. His research ultimately suggests that the more regular and positive these household interactions are, the better the child will perform academically and the less likely they will be to internalize problems.  In neuropsychology  Gottlieb's model of probabilistic epigenesis is based on the idea that certain areas of the brain are operational before they are completely developed. This means that, while the development process is occurring, neural structures are prone to influence‚Äìeither internal or external. The multi-directional relationship between these influences is again important when regarding brain development into maturation, as brain maturation and functional experience are both the cause and effect of one another. = Contrasting the \\"nature versus nurture\\" model = ‚ÄúNature versus nurture,‚Äù a term coined by Francis Galton in the late 1800s, was an early and simple way of explaining human behavior. In this model, child development into adolescence and adulthood can be explained either by intrinsic aspects of the child or by extrinsic factors influencing the child. Probabilistic epigenesis draws from this model in that it emphasizes the importance of factors that could be categorized as nature and/or nurture. However, it expands upon and complicates the idea that it is either nature or nurture that causes a person to act a certain way. In probabilistic epigenesis, nature and nurture interact so that every variable is both a cause and an effect. As developmental and neurological understandings have progressed, the idea that intrinsic and extrinsic factors interact with one another rather than independently, as suggested in the probabilistic epigenesis model, has become the predominate way of understanding behavior.

It was discovered in 2017. Taxonomy and evolution The species name \\"cyanolaemus\\" is based on the Latinized Greek words for ultramarine blue (kuanos) and throat (laimos). Based on a sequences of a single mitochondrial gene, ND2, the species was found to be closely related to a clade composed of the black- breasted hillstar (O. melanogaster) and the green-headed hillstar (O. stolzmanni). Description The top of the head of the male blue-throated hillstar is iridescent emerald green, which extends from the forehead to the base of the crown. The iridescent highlights are blue-green. The nape of the neck, mantle, lower portion of the back, rump, and upperwing coverts are bright emerald green. Some feathers in these regions have blue-green edging, and some have bronze highlights. The uppertail coverts are emerald blue-green. The upper surface of the central flight feathers are blackish blue. The other flight feathers and the upperwing coverts are dull black to dusky greenish blue, with a blue sheen. The outermost primary feathers have a white edge. The feathers of the throat and chin are a glittering ultramarine blue, with white bases separated from the blue parts of the feather by a black line. The feathers of the throat have slightly green tips, and are longer on the sides of the throat than in the middle; the extent of these green tips varies between individuals. The bright blue throat patch was the basis for its name. The bird has a velvety black collar around its throat. The belly and the breast are a dull white color, and the feathers in these regions have black bases. There is a black longitudinal stripe in the middle of the belly. The sides and flanks of the bird are between green and greenish gray, with metallic green highlights. The undertail coverts are dull grayish-buff, while the lower surface of the tail is dull white. The flight feathers of the tail are blackish blue. In the female of the species, the back is emerald green, with some variation between bluish and bronze-green. The uppertail coverts are brighter and more blue than in the male. The wing coverts are dusky bluish green, and the outer primaries have a white edge. The throat and chin are speckled; the feathers are black at the base, whitish in the middle, and grayish olive on the outer half, with a dark green spot. The sides of the throat are whiter than in the male. The extent of the dusky color in the throat varies between individuals. The flanks, belly, breast, and undertail coverts are grayish buff with occasional brighter olive green feathers, as are the ventral regions of the tail. The tail has white patches, the size and shape of which vary between individuals. The flight feathers of the tail are dusky bluish green. In both sexes, the beak is black, with yellowish tomia. A holotype specimen weighed 8.15 g. Males of the species may be distinguished from congeners by the presence of the ultramarine throat, emerald green head and upperparts with bluish-green feather tips, and emerald green tips to the throat feathers. Females may be distinguished by the presence of a dusky-gray chin and upper throat in contrast to a whitish lower throat, and emerald green head and upperparts with bluish green feather tips on the head and a bluish green shine on the body. The males are most similar to those of the green- headed hillstar (O. stolzmanni) and the Ecuadorian hillstar (O. chimborazo); they are differentiated most clearly by the green throat patch in the green- headed hillstar, and the purple hood in the Ecuadorian hillstar. The vocalizations of the blue-throated hillstar are similar to those of its congeners; they are highly variable, and include rapid titters of rising and falling frequency, and single noted calls consisting of an \\"up‚Äìdown stroke\\". Habitat and ecology The preferred habitat of the blue-throated hillstar is grassland with patches of shrubs in the Andean paramo. In the region that the type specimen was collected, the shrubs were dominated by Chuquiraga. The terrain in which it was found included hilly regions, steep terrain, rocky outcrops, and stream banks. O. cyanolaemus was observed to feed by clinging to branches sideways or upside down, or by perching next to flowers. It was observed feeding most frequently from Chuquiraga jussieui, and also from Macleania rupestris and Lleresia hypoleuca. Collected males were also found to have eaten flies. Some females were once observed making aerial sallies after swarming flies. Blue-throated hillstars were frequently observed being chased away from perches by Shining Sunbeams (Aglaeactis cupripenni). Aggressive interactions were also seen between it and the Viridian metaltail (Metallura williami). Distribution and conservation The species is endemic to an area of about where it is found along bush-lined creeks on small ridges not surpassing 3700 m. The range of this species is restricted by the Jubones-Le√≥n river valley to the north and northeast and the Puyango-Catamayo drainage basin to the south. No more than 750 individuals have been estimated to exist, and this population is highly threatened by fire, grazing, and gold mining. Nature and Culture International is working with Ecuador‚Äôs Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Tourism, Water Secretary, municipalities of Saraguro and Zaruma, Kawsay Foundation and local and indigenous communities to establish a new conservation area for this species. The proposed area ‚Äì spanning around 175,000 acres in Cerro de Arcos ‚Äì will protect the blue- throated hillstar‚Äôs entire habitat in addition to critical p√°ramo and cloud forest ecosystems, wetlands and important water sources. The area will also preserve portions of the Inca trail, an ancient trail used by the Inca empire to connect Cuzco with its northern capital, Quito.

Biography  Radkevich's exact birthplace and date of birth are unknown. By his own admission, he was a cadet of the Arakcheev Cadet Corps in Nizhny Novgorod. At the age of 14, he was tempted by a depraved woman who was about 30 years old. After a while she abandoned the young man, but not before she could infect him with syphilis. Upon learning this, Radkevich was enraged and tried to kill his former beloved, but did not succeed, as the woman's new lover captured the failed assassin and took him to the station. After a messed up scandal, Radkevich was expelled from the Cadet Corps. Radkevich decided that vocation of his whole life is the purification of the world from depraved women. He committed his first murder in June 1909, killing 20-year-old prostitute Anna Blumentrost. In total, Radkevich inflicted 12 stab wounds to her face, neck and shoulders, and then dropped the body in the Neva River. On July 1, the body was found and identified. In St. Petersburg, prostitutes began to panic, and the police began to search for the cruel murderer with special zeal. On July 14, 1909, Radkevich met with a prostitute in Vosstaniya Square, Ekaterina Gerus. He brought her to the \\"Danube\\" hotel, which was at that time on Ligovsky Avenue, and ordered the number 9 room on the 3rd floor. At night, Radkevich stabbed Gerus at least 20 times with a knife, but did not kill her this way, and strangled her instead. The next day at 8 AM Radkevich left the room, telling the bellhop to wake her up in an hour. The bellhop soon discovered Gerus' body. Investigators came to the conclusion that both murders were committed by one criminal. On July 24, Radkevich attacked maid Zinaida Levin. With the cry of \\"Death to beauties!\\", he began to strike her with his knife, but was frightened by random passers-by, and he fled without completing what had been started. On the following day, Radkevich made another unsuccessful attack on a prostitute in a brothel on Kolomenskaya Street. Most of his casual acquaintances represented Radkevich as Vadim Krovianik, for which he later received his nickname, and perhaps that was why he could not be caught in the early stages. The investigation into the Radkevich case was personally led by the head of the St. Petersburg Detective Police Vladimir Filippov. Radkevich committed his last murder on September 19, 1909. On that day he, according to the scenario of July 14, lured the prostitute Maria Budocnikov to the hotel \\"Kiao\\", where he inflicted 35 stab wounds, robbed her and then left a note on the bed:But the bellhop was vigilant, and when he Budocnikova's corpse in the keyhole, he made a noise. Radkevich tried to resist the bellhop by hitting him with a knife, but the hotel employees arrived on time to detain the maniac. = Trial, sentence and death = Initially, Radkevich was placed in the psychiatric hospital of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, which was on the bank of the Pryazhkha River. Psychiatrists' opinions were divided - according to some, he was a sadist, fully responsible for his actions, and according to others - a degenerate with congenital defects in captivity false superidea. On March 10, 1912, a jury trial took place, which sentenced Nikolay Radkevich to eight years in the katorga. In the autumn of 1916 he was killed by criminals while serving his sentence.

He was a high school physics teacher in a remote city and worked in his spare time on the problem of large sets of disjoint Steiner triple systems. Biography =Background= Lu Jiaxi was born in a poor family in Shanghai. His father was a seller of soy sauce concentrate. His parents had four children, but the three older children all died early from illness, and Lu Jiaxi was the only surviving child. When he was in junior middle school, his father died from an illness that the family could not afford to treat, so he started working after finishing junior middle school in 1949 to earn a living. He served an apprenticeship at an automobile hardware firm in Shanghai. In October 1951, he was admitted to a statistics training course in Shenyang offered by the administration for electrical equipment industry of Northeast China, and he finished first in his class. He was then assigned to a motor factory in Harbin. While working at the factory, he self-studied high school materials. He also learned Russian at a night school, and later English and Japanese to be able to look up literature. In 1956, he joined the fight against the flooding of Songhua River, for which he was commended. In 1957, he passed the college entrance exam and was admitted to Department of Physics of Jilin Normal University, now called Northeast Normal University (not the university that took the same name in 2002). After graduation in 1961, he was assigned to Baotou Steel and Iron Institute, now called Inner Mongolia University of Science and Technology, as a teaching assistant. In 1962, after reorganization of the institute, he was assigned first to the Teaching and Research Office of Baotou Education Bureau, then to several middle schools in Baotou as a physics teacher. He worked at Baotou Eighth Middle School, Baotou Fifth Middle School, Baotou Twenty-fourth Middle School from 1965 to 1973, and Baotou Ninth Middle School from 1973 to his death in 1983. Because of his physics background and his past experience as a factory worker, he was also in charge of a school-run factory which produced radio components. He married in the summer of 1972 to a doctor introduced by his colleague. =Mathematical research= In the summer of 1956, he read a popular science book on mathematical problems written by Chinese mathematician Sun Zeying (, published under the name J. Tseying Sun) called Shuxue Fangfa Qu Yin () and was fascinated by the Kirkman's schoolgirl problem. He devoted himself into solving the generalized version of the problem, studying relevant areas in mathematics on his own and spending a lot of time on research. In December 1961, he wrote up a paper on its solution and another paper on Latin squares and sent them to Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The reply letter came in February 1963, in which they did not directly comment on the papers but suggested that he check them himself and send them to journals if the results were new, and they included some references on latest developments. He revised his paper on the generalized Kirkman's schoolgirl problem and submitted it to Shuxue Tongbao () in March 1963. His paper was too long and technical for the journal which aimed at middle school teachers, however, it took the journal one year to reply to him that he should submit it elsewhere. After further revisions, he submitted the paper to Acta Mathematica Sinica on March 14, 1965. On February 7, 1966, he received the rejection letter from the journal criticizing it as \\"basically not really new results, worthless\\". It was realized after his death that this rejection was a serious mistake. In 1966, he sent two other papers to journals with no response, since with the start of the Cultural Revolution all academic activities were disrupted. He was discouraged by the rejections and wrote in his diary that he \\"had since then given up the thought of submitting papers\\". After the Cultural Revolution, he resubmitted some revised papers, but they were not accepted. In April 1979, in some journal issues of 1974 and 1975 that he managed to borrow from Beijing, he unexpectedly learned from a paper of Haim Hanani that the problem which he solved in his 1965 paper had been solved and first published in 1971 by Ray-Chaudhuri and R. M. Wilson, which was a big blow to him. He went on to tackle the problem of large sets of disjoint Steiner triple systems. Zhu Lie (), a professor of mathematics at Soochow University working also in combinatorial mathematics, realized the importance of his work and suggested that he submit it to the international journal Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A. He wrote to its editorial board that he had essentially solved the problem, and the editors replied to him that if what he said was true, it would be a major achievement. (Many leaders in the field had worked on the problem starting from in 1917. Only a few special cases were solved at the time. A note published by in 1981 said: \\"[A]n extensive amount of work has been done on [this] problem ... This problem remains far from settled however\\".) So he brushed up his English and borrowed a typewriter to type up his work. It was a tremendous task for him as he could type at most four pages a night. He submitted a total of nearly 200 typed pages to the journal. The journal received six of his series of papers between September 1981 and March 1983 and published the first three in March 1983. The editors informed him that they would also publish his next three papers. He also sent a paper on resolvable balanced incomplete block designs to Acta Mathematica Sinica in August 1979, and a revised version was received by the journal in September 1983. This paper was published in July 1984 and was regarded as equally important by international experts. In spite of his heavy teaching duties, he carried on with his private mathematical research, often working until after midnight. He also made occasional trips to Beijing to find library resources. He told his colleagues that while he liked physics more, certain material conditions were required for physics research, but he only needed paper to do mathematics. Unfortunately, laborious work and harsh living conditions made his health deteriorate over time. His family of four lived in a small house of ten-odd square meters. The only table at home was used by his daughters, so he had to do his calculations on a broken kang bed-stove. On his trips to Beijing, he bought hard seat tickets since he could not afford sleeper tickets. He ate his dried food in a library in the daytime and slept on a bench in a train station at night. He sometimes wrote in his diary about how his mental fatigue affected his research and his teaching, and that he needed to get healthier for his research. After he had received dozens of copies of the journal issue containing his first three papers, his family and friends reminded him to get some rest, but he said that he could not since he had not much time. To have a better research environment, he tried to get transferred to university with his friends' help since 1978, but he could not find any suitable position after several years of effort. =Late recognition and death= His Western peers discovered a leader in the field with exceptional achievements, while he still remained largely unknown to the Chinese mathematical community. In the first ever combinatorial mathematics conference in China held in Dalian in July 1983, when two Canadian mathematicians Eric Mendelsohn and John Adrian Bondy, who were the referees of Lu's papers, arrived and asked for Lu Jiaxi, one of the organizers thought they were looking for the President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences with the same sounding name. It was the first time the Chinese combinatorialists got to know him. Upon hearing Lu present his work in a session, Wu Lisheng of Soochow University recommended that he should give a talk on it at the closing ceremony. After his talk, he received a unanimous accolade. In August, he took part in a combinatorics workshop in Hefei as a helper and gave a talk there. Although he had gained recognition from scholars in his field, he was still living in poverty. School leaders did not appreciate his engagement in research, seeing it as a deviation from his work duties. They even assigned him more duties such as timekeeping on sports day to keep him occupied. In a school general meeting, the principal reprimanded him, saying, \\"We are a middle school. Someone wants to be a scientist, he may as well be transferred to the Academy of Sciences.\\" When he was finally invited to mathematical conferences in China, his middle school refused to support his travel fee, saying that according to the rules allowances were provided only for teaching related activities. He had to borrow from his friends to attend the conferences. The conferences brought him into the mathematical community. He was invited as a speaker to the fourth national conference of the Chinese Mathematical Society in late October. Several universities in China wanted to offer him positions, and he decided to go to South China Normal University. The Canadian mathematicians were planning to invite him for a visit at University of Toronto. After attending the national conference of the Chinese Mathematical Society in Wuhan, which ended on October 27, he hurried back to Baotou by train in order not to miss his classes. After stopping briefly at Beijing for the libraries, he arrived home at about 6 in the evening of Sunday, October 30, 1983. He told his wife joyfully about the praises he received in the last few months and his future research plan. At about 1 am that night, he suffered from a sudden heart attack in sleep and died. Although his wife was a doctor, she did not have any equipment to save him, not even a telephone at home to call for help. He was survived by his wife Zhang Shuqin () and two daughters. Only two days before his death, his middle school received a letter from the President of University of Toronto David Strangway written on September 30. In the letter, he asked the school principal for permission to transfer Lu to a university for the development of Chinese mathematics. On November 23, David Strangway sent a letter of condolences to Lu's middle school and family, in which he said that people would greatly miss \\"Prof. Lu Jiaxi\\" for his knowledge and contributions. In January 1984, an editor of Mathematical Reviews sent Lu an invitation letter to be a reviewer, not knowing of his death. After his death, the Inner Mongolia government helped his family repay their debts and honored him for his achievements. On the first anniversary of his death, a memorial gathering was held by the government officials at Baotou First Workers' Cultural Palace, and the Chairman of the Autonomous Region issued a document titled \\"Learn from Comrade Lu Jiaxi\\" (). He was given Special Class Award in the first Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Science and Technology Progress Award in 1985. An investigation on his research was carried out by a number of Chinese mathematicians. Although his 1961 and 1963 papers were lost, they found the manuscript of his 1965 paper and confirmed that it was the first paper to solve the generalized Kirkman's schoolgirl problem completely. In fact, according to Zhu Lie, it contained an asymptotically stronger result than that in the paper by Ray-Chaudhuri and Wilson. Eric Mendelsohn praised Lu's large set theorem as one of the most significant achievements in the field in the past 20 years. He wrote an article on Lu's work, in which he regretted that \\"Lu Jia-xi should have had a distinguished career as a mathematician. ... He, however, spent too many years as a high school teacher with virtually no time to do research and virtually no contact with the research community\\". The seventh paper in the series on disjoint Steiner triple systems treating the cases for the last six values in the theorem, which he had announced to have solved in the Dalian combinatorial mathematics conference, was left unfinished as a 24-page manuscript, with an outline and a few results. (Actually, once the cases for three of the values were proved, the cases for the other three values would follow immediately from previous results.) A few Chinese mathematicians tried to use the procedure sketched in the manuscript or other methods to solve the cases without success. The very last part of the theorem the proof of which Lu had not finished writing down before his death was finally completed by Luc Teirlinck in 1989. Although Teirlinck's proof did not follow the outline in the manuscript, it nevertheless made use of the combinatorial structures that Lu had constructed. Lu Jiaxi was awarded posthumously in 1987 the First Class Award of the State Natural Science Award, then the highest honor in science in China, for his work on large sets of disjoint Steiner triple systems.

He helped found the Kurdish media broadcasting outlets Rudaw and Kurdistan 24. He served as the general manager of Kurdistan 24, based in the Kurdistan's capital Erbil, from 2015 to 2019. Waisy currently serves as the press secretary to Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) Prime Minister Masrour Barzani. Early life Waisy was born in the small village of Girtik in Kurdistan's Choman district near the border with Iran. Waisy and his family fled their hometown after the 1975 Kurdish revolution was crushed by Iraqi forces. They (along with thousands of other Kurds from Iraqi Kurdistan) stayed in Iran for several months as refugees before returning to the Kurdistan region. The village of Girtik was one of many that was destroyed by the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. It was burned to the ground, the result of a scorched earth practice that was implemented in parallel with the Arabization policy of the Ba‚Äôathist regime. Waisy and his family were forcibly displaced to the southern provinces of Iraq, where he lived in Al-Diwaniyah and Baqubah for five years. In the 1980s, he graduated high school in Soran before earning a degree in Administration and Economy at the University of Salahuddin in Erbil. Time as a refugee In 2002, Waisy fled to Syria before the fall of Saddam's regime in Iraq. The Kurdish status in Iraqi Kurdistan was vulnerable to military incursions, notably from Turkey,) which was combating the Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK), an insurgent group based in the mountains between the Kurdistan region's border with Turkey and Iran. In 2004, Waisy emigrated to Canada as a refugee after the fall of Saddam and during the start of the Iraq War ‚Äì Operation Iraqi Freedom. In Canada, he settled in Toronto with many other Kurdish refugees and helped found the Greater Toronto Area Kurdish House. He eventually received Canadian citizenship. In 2008, Waisy returned to Kurdistan where he helped establish Rudaw Media, which was at first limited to a newspaper and a website. Eventually, the outlet launched its own television channel. In 2012, Waisy was a recipient of the British Chevening Scholarship for International Students. He completed a Master of Arts in Journalism and Media Communications at the University of Hertfordshire in London. Prior to the emergence of the Islamic State in Iraq, Waisy returned to Erbil in 2013 to work on a new media project. In 2015, at the height of the Islamic State's control of territories in northern and central Iraq, just outside Erbil's borders, Waisy launched a major news network, Kurdistan 24, as founder and general manager. Professional life Waisy is a published author in Arabic, Kurdish, and English. He has contributed to multiple international and Middle Eastern news outlets, including The Washington Times, The Jerusalem Post, the Telegraph, and others in Kurdistan. Waisy has appeared as a political analyst on Al-Jazeera Arabic and English, France 24, Fox News, BBC Arabic, and other local broadcasting channels. He continues to appear frequently on major television networks and in the press where he discusses Kurdistan issues. As Kurdistan 24 general manager, Waisy was also the organizer of a major symposium held in the United States' Congress in 2017 ahead of Kurdistan's referendum on independence. The Capitol Hill symposium from July 28, 2017, sponsored jointly by Kurdistan 24 and The Washington Times, was entitled \\"The Kurdistan Region: A Strategic US Ally in a Tough Neighborhood\\". Waisy coordinated with The Washington Times to run a special edition dedicated to the referendum. He organized a similar event in London with the Centre for Kurdish Progress and concurrently ran a special edition with British news outlet, The Telegraph.

The club competes in a number of Olympic shooting disciplines including air rifle and small bore. It is the University's third oldest sports club, and its members include students, alumni and staff from Trinity College. Early history While there are records of competitive shooting in Trinity College (beyond that of duelling) going back as far as 1840, the club in its present session was founded in January 1962 by P.G.L. Coulson (who went on to become its first Captain), M.C.C. Heaton (first Secretary) and C.R. Oakley (first Treasurer). In its first year the club had over 50 members yet no range and virtually no equipment. The first record of anyone shooting was as part of a team sent to Bisley in July 1962 competing in fullbore events. A History of Dublin University Rifle Club. By Albert Jordan Johnston, edited by Iain G Nash 2006 The first Chief Range Officer (C.R.O.) was appointed in 1964, the post was held by M.C.C. Heaton, and with that the first Range was established and approved by the College Board for the Lincoln gate end of College in May 1964 and by October of that year the C.R.O. reported it operational. The initial annual membership fee was ¬£5 p.a. and affiliation to Dublin University Central Athletics Committee was completed by November 1964 but at this point the club still sought Garda approval for the range. This was to be granted in January 1965 and so two years after the foundation the first shot was fired on Trinity soil. IE/TCD/MUN/CLUB/DUCAC/50, Rifle Club Records, Trinity College Dublin Manuscripts Archives At the 1965 A.G.M. M.C.C. Heaton a founder member of the club and its first PinkTrinity College Dublin, D.U.C.A.C. Offices, Captains Committee Minute Books, passim., was made a Vice President of the club in honour of his services and achievements. By the end of 1966 the club had a membership of over one hundred people and a ladder system of the challenge type was introduced. By May 1967 a system akin to the present ladder was introduced with constantly revised averages being posted. The first recorded lady on committee was a Miss J Johnston who was elected at the 1969 A.G.M.Trinity College Dublin, D.U.C.A.C. Offices, Rifle Club Records, passim. and in October 1970 Captain John Martin became a Vice President and the move to the new Park Lane range was completed. In January 1972 D.U.R.C. lost its main colours opponents as Queen's University Belfast were no longer permitted to shoot during the \\"Troubles\\" in Northern Ireland, henceforth the club would have to look further a-field for Intervarsity matches. Present status In recent years, membership of DURC typically reaches 500+ members in any given academic year, with the club becoming one of the largest clubs in the university. The club currently operates a range in the former biochemistry building, with a state of the art 10-lane range originally due to be completed in 2019 as part of the Printing House Hall development in Trinity College, but delayed to 2020 because of college closure as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notable members Since the formation of the modern club a number of members have \\"contributed significantly to the mission of the club\\" and been honoured by DURC for said. Some of these members are listed below: * M.C.C. Heaton (1965) was awarded the first Rifle Pink and is to this day, the holder of the Club Fullbore Record. He was also the first recipient of Club Colours and the first student Vice President of the Club. M.C.C. Heaton was the first Treasurer and Chief Range Officer of Dublin University Rifle Club. * Peter Gillespie (1978), the second recorded recipient of Rifle Pinks and was the first recorded member to be elected in to the Knights of the Campanile, the ‚Äòsecret‚Äô society for the elite Sportsmen of Trinity College. Peter served as both Treasurer and Secretary. * Brian Nelson (1980) was a secretary of the club and was one of the main driving influences behind the introduction and success of Sporter Rifle. Brian‚Äôs restraining influence was also noted when he helped sort out difficulties within the committee which prevented the disintegration of the club. Brian served as Chief Range Officer and Match Secretary. Unfortunately he died of a heart attack in 1982. * Susan FitzSimon (1981) was mentioned as the most successful D.U.R.C. athlete to date in the British Top XX class (the International Class), where she put in a 589 and was ranked fifth. *Anthony Traill (1858) 33rd Provost of Trinity College Dublin.

Murders  From March 2011 to September 2012 in the Volga and Ural Federal Districts, a number of very similar murders of elderly women occurred. Investigators believe that all crimes were committed by one person, as all victims were single women aged 75 to 90 years old, each living in a Khrushchyovka. According to investigators, the perpetrator infiltrated the apartment, pretending to be an employee of HOA or the social service. All victims were strangled with improvised items (for example, a bathroom robe belt). After the murders, the criminal would steal money and valuables from the apartment. But the investigators believe that stealing pensioners' money was not a priority for the killer. The first nine murders took place in Kazan. One of the victims survived, but could not describe their attacker. Similar murders took place in Ulyanovsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Izhevsk, Perm (two murders in April 2012) and Samara (two murders in April‚ÄìMay 2012). By August 1, 2012, there were 18 murders. Between September 25 and 27, 2012, the last 3 murders were committed in Ufa. The total number of murders is 32. On September 26, 2012, the perpetrator was captured on a CCTV camera at the entrance of one of his victim's homes. Thanks to this, a facial composite was compiled. In 2013, a reward of 1 million rubles was promised in return for information regarding the investigation. In the same year, a theory appeared that the killer was hiding in the Sakhalin Oblast. On the night of October 7, 2016, in Kazan, a man suspected of being the criminal was filmed by a video camera in a house on Chuikov Street, but the Investigative Committee denied he was the perpetrator. On February 6, 2017, the Deputy Head of the Main Criminalistics Directorate of the Criminal Investigation Service of the Russian Federation, Ivan Streltsov, told reporters that the investigators have good reasons to believe that the person being sought is a resident of Udmurtia. It was also suggested that the man could have a list of pensioners. At the same time, the investigators do not exclude that the person may be sought in prisons or colonies, or that he is no longer alive. According to the Streltsov, the reward for information that would help establish the identity of the criminal was increased to 3 million rubles. On March 28, 2017, 37-year-old Kazakh native Pavel Shayakhmetov was arrested in Samara on suspicion of involvement in the murders, as he had killed two elderly women in Samara on March 25 and 27, 2017. On May 25, 2017, investigators suggested that the offender was a native of Tatarstan and studied in one of Kazan's schools. Currently, the investigation continues.

She is best known as the narrator of the medieval Irish poem \\"The Lament of the Hag of Beara\\", in which she bitterly laments the passing of her youth and her decrepit old age.Hill (1927), p. 226 The Hag of Beara is said to have been born in Dingle, County Kerry, at \\"Teach Mor\\" or the Great House, described as \\"the house farthest west in Ireland\\", and today identified as Tivore on the Dingle promontory. Along with County Kerry, she is also closely associated with County Cork, with the Book of Lecan (c.1400AD) detailing some of the stories around her legacy. In some tellings, she lived several lives, and is said to have been a mother or foster mother to the ancestors of a number of prominent clans, including the Corca Dhuibhne and Corca Loighdhe.Zucchelli (2016), pp.25-26 According to legend, the hag had seven successive periods of youth, during which her sons and their sons rose some of the region's most prominent clans.

Munro was a key part of the team that formed the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1972 with Bill Hunter, Ben Hatskin, and Ed Chynoweth. Early life Roderick Neil \\"Scotty\\" Munro was born in 1917 in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada. Growing up, he played baseball and hockey for the Moose Jaw Canucks. Coaching career After an oil refinery explosion burned his legs and crushed his professional career pursuit, Munro began playing senior hockey in Yorkton and Melville. In 1943, he coached the Moose Jaw Juvenille Falcolns all the way to the Saskatchewan Championship Cup, which he won again the following year as coach of the Moose Jaw Monarchs. He then began coaching the junior hockey club Lethbridge Native Sons and Moose Jaw Canucks before joining the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL) as a coach for the Humboldt Indians. During his tenure with the Indians, he led them to three first place finishes in the SJHL before moving them to Estevan, Saskatchewan and renaming them the Estevan Bruins. During this time, he was also longlisted for the Sportsman of the Year Award. In 1956, Munro was voted in as franchise holder of the Western Canadian Hockey League (WCHL) Medicine Hat Tigers for their first year of Junior \\"A\\" Hockey, while still coaching in Estevan and acting as a chief scout in Western Canada. He was suspended for the 1958‚Äì59 season due to an incident during a game against the MooseJaw Canucks and appointed his wife head coach in his place. He hired Howie Milford to replace him as coach of the Bruins but was forced to take the position in 1961 after Milford resigned to work with the Omaha Knights. During this period, Munro attempted to copy to National Football League by placing a speaker and receiver in players gear. In his first attempt at the coach-player radio communication during a game, the team won. However, by the 1968‚Äì1969 season, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association deemed the WCHL an \\"outlaw league\\" and refused to let them participate in the Memorial Cup. Munro released the coaching position to Punch McLean and Bill Shinske. After releasing his coaching position, Munro and Bob Brownridge cofounded the Calgary Centennials, a junior hockey team. Later, in 1971, Munro planned on bringing a new hockey team called the Calgary Broncos to play in the World Hockey Association. However, after owner Bob Brownridge died, financial issues caused the Cleveland Crusaders to take their place. As owner of the Centennials, Munro refused to allow his players to use curved sticks and asked trainer Bearcat Murray to keep an eye on the players so they would not attempt to curve their own sticks using hot water. In his role as owner, Munro was a key part of the team that formed the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1972 with Bill Hunter, Ben Hatskin, and Ed Chynoweth. Munro died from cancer on September 20, 1975, at the age of 57. In his honour, the WHL awards the Scotty Munro Memorial Trophy to their regular season champion.

They were moderate and independent Whigs. At the 1695 English general election he was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Pembrokeshire in succession to his father. He was returned again at the 1698 English general election. His only contest was in the first election of 1701 when he won by 426 to 5 votes. He was returned unopposed again at the second general election of 1701, and at the 1702 English general election. He stood aside for his brother at the 1705 English general election and instead was Mayor of Pembroke in 1705, 1706 and 1707 in which period he increased the number of councilmen and burgesses. As a result he was returned unopposed as MP for Pembroke Boroughs at the 1708 British general election. He was a teller for the Whigs voted for the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709, and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverel in 1710.

She was the first person of European descent to be born in Wise County, Texas. She was a versatile and prolific writer, when the brief time allotted to her is considered. Shortridge was born in 1858 and died in 1893. She published a volume of poems entitled Lone Star Lights (1890), two novels, Held in Trust (1892) and Circumstance (1893), and numerous short stories and sketches. Early years and education Belle Hunt was born in 1858, at Cactus Hill, Texas, near Decatur, Texas. She was the first child of European ancestry born in Wise County. She was the daughter of William Hudson Hunt, a pioneer of the Republic of Texas, who was commissioned and served as lieutenant-colonel in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and was appointed government surveyor. Later, he was widely known as locator of lands, and as a progressive citizen of the State of Texas. He was descended from the Northampton line of Hunts, England. Belle Hunt inherited from this distinguished lineage the artistic and literary talent that brought her into general and favorable notice as poet and authoress. Orphaned in early childhood, she was reared by her guardian, Sylvanus Reed, of Bonham, Texas, where at Carleton College, she attended school until she entered the Visitation Academy of St. Louis, from which institution she was graduated with first honors at seventeen years of age. Career Shortly after completing her education, she married to Capt. Samuel A. Shortridge (1837‚Äì1908), of St. Louis, in which city they removed to Fort Worth, Texas, and finally made a permanent home in Terrell, Texas. With laudable ambition she went to New York City (1890) in the interest of her literary labor, where in a remarkably short time, her articles were accepted and published by the leading papers, journals and magazines of the city. There, she was at home in the parlors of Miriam Leslie, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, and other literati. She was fond of nature, and this passion breathes out in her lyrics and prose as well. Sympathy, appreciation, affection, were her heart longings. Lone Star Lights (1891) was her first volume of poems. The dedication of this little volume was widely copied, and was made the subject of fifty watercolors by a woman, of Dallas. The poem, \\"Peach Blossom Time,\\" in same volume, was set to music and published by her friend, Mrs. George W. Voiers, of Forney, Texas. It was James Gordon Bennett who said of this poem: \\"Nothing more exquisite is to be found in the English language.\\" Dispassionate critics pronounced her first novel, Held in Trust (1892), as a pleasing story‚Äîfresh, clean and sweet as a breeze from a Texas prairie. Her second novel, Circumstance (1892), was set in Austin, Texas. Her short stories appeared in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, in the North American Review, the New York World, and other leading periodicals. Shortridge wrote especially well for children, her \\"Jingles\\" (Modern Mother Goose) attracted wide attention in the columns of the Sunday World. Personal life and legacy She died November 24, 1893, in New York City, and was interred in the family burying ground at Cactus Hill, Wise County, which is now submerged under Lake Bridgeport. A memoir of Shortridge was in preparation‚Äîa sort of autobiographical sketch of her literary work and mechanical methods, compiled from her journals and letters, by her sister, Mrs. Kate Hunt Craddock.

He was one of the first foreign representatives sent to Europe by President Guadalupe Victoria to establish relations. He served as Minister of Interior and Exterior Relations during the presidency of Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna in 1835. He was also a Senator of the Republic for Yucat√°n. In 1863, he headed the delegation that offered the Mexican throne to Maximilian of Habsburg at Miramare Castle. His brother, Joaqu√≠n Guti√©rrez de Estrada, also a conservative politician, was Governor of Yucat√°n. Early Life Jos√© Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez was born into a wealthy Yucatec family which allowed him to receive a formal education in Mexico City. He was only 28 years old in 1828 when president Guadalupe Victoria sent him to Europe as part of a diplomatic mission to the Dutch Republic. It was at this time that he was married to the sister of the Count of La Cortina, uniting him to another very wealthy Mexican family. In 1831, he was elected to the national Senate as a deputy from Yucatan, representing the Centralist Party, which won him the great enmity of the Federalists in Congress, especially Manuel Crescencio Garc√≠a Rej√≥n. In 1833, he was exiled by the liberal government of Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as.

After the band's preceding EP Songs for Owsley (1996) moved them away from guitar-oriented music and towards electronic music, Forever Alien furthered this approach considerably, as Kember aimed to create a predominately electronic album that sounded organic and analogue in style. The record is dominated by vintage analogue synthesizers, including the EMS VCS 3 and EMS Synthi AKS. Kember had become fascinated by the synths as he felt they presented him with more musical possibilities than guitars. The resulting album fuses psychedelic music with influences from the 1960s electronic music of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. \\"Feels Like I'm Slipping Away\\" was released as a single. Although Forever Alien did not chart in either the United Kingdom or United States, it was a modest radio success in the US, and received acclaim from critics. Musicians such as Helena Hauff and Ekoplekz have since cited it among their favourite albums. Will Carruthers joined Spectrum on their 1997 tour in support of the album. Background In 1994, Spectrum released the album Highs, Lows and Heavenly Blows, which explored atypical compositional structures and musical scales. Following its release, lead member (and former Spacemen 3 member) Peter Kember, who used the pseudonym Sonic Boom, entered the band into a short hiatus as he resumed working on other musical projects. Spectrum reconvened in 1996 for A Pox on You, a collaboration with Seattle band Jessamine, and also released the Songs for Owsley EP in late 1996. The EP was named in tribute to LSD manufacturer Owsley Stanley, and moved Spectrum away from guitar-oriented music and towards a keyboard-dominated direction, making use of synthesiser distortion, predicting the musical style of Forever Alien, which also incorporated the songs found on Songs for Owsley. The EP ranged from the \\"goofy and threatening\\" semi-title track \\"Owsley\\", with heavily distorted vocals and noise elements, to the calm instrumental \\"Liquid Intentions.\\" Spectrum followed Songs from Owsley with the recording of Forever Alien, their first non-collaborative album in three years. Recording and production Forever Alien is dominated by vintage synthesizers like the EMS VCS 3 (pictured). Kember's vision for Forever Alien was to create a predominantly electronic album that did not sound \\"super sequenced and block-y,\\" and aimed to bring to the album \\"some of the flowing stream of effects\\" he was experiencing under the influence of DMT. He later explained: \\"I was writing what I felt were some quite soul-searching songs and I wanted to marry it all in another world. In another land, if you will.\\" Kember recorded Forever Alien with fellow members Alf Hardy and Pete Bain, the latter of whom is credited as Pete Bassman. The album was recorded at Cabin Studios, Coventry with Hardy co- producing with Kember (again credited as Sonic Boom). Andre Knecht mastered the album at Ark Digital Pasadena, Canada. Kember was becoming interested in modular synthesisers at the time, including the EMS VCS 3, and became intrigued in the \\"endless possibilities\\" he felt they presented. Consequently, Forever Alien was recorded mainly vintage analogue synthesisers. Kember was intrigued with modular synthesis as it allowed him to create more effects than he could with the \\"limited palette\\" of a guitar, and also allowed him to \\"control it with great detail and link things.\\" He later described the VCS 3 as a \\"very elegant study in limited resources\\" and noted his taste for the synth's slow modulations and slow changes, which he felt was absent in most synths. He elaborated: \\"A lot of equipment never lets you get dangerous. You just get this narrow band of what‚Äôs considered usable. I like stuff with the safety locks all taken off. I was always interested in sounds that were not really of this world. I very much believe in animism. Inanimate objects and sounds can have real personalities.\\" As Forever Alien was Kember's attempt to explore modular synthesis, the album features little of Kember's guitar work and contains almost no songs with bass. Kember instead plays a range of electronic instruments, namely the EMS VCS 3, EMS Synthi AKS, OSC OSCar, the theremin and the Serge Modular Music System, in addition to singing on the album and using the vocoder. Hardy also uses the vocoder, and plays voltage- controlled synthesisers and the vibraphone, while Bain is credited for \\"programming vibrations.\\" During recording, Kember contacted former BBC Radiophonic Workshop musician Delia Derbyshire after he noticed his friend's copy of the BBC Radiophonic Music album contained a blurb about Delia that mentioned her birthplace as Coventry. Kember remained friends with Derbyshire for the last years of her life, and credits her with teaching him \\"pretty much everything I know about the physics of sound. The basis of modular synthesis I taught myself, but stuff like the harmonic series, she'd spend endless hours helping me get it into my thick head.\\" Composition Forever Alien is dominated by Kember's vintage keyboards, in addition to usage of vocoders and theremins, continuing the style indicated on Songs for Owsley. Ned Raggett of AllMusic described the resulting sound as resembling \\"a head-on collision between 1957-era sci-fi movies, 1968 psych, and whatever else is floating through Sonic's brain.\\" Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club described the album as \\"tripped-out hazy music-from-space,\\" and noted the incorporation of layered electronics, looped samples and a \\"keen gift for subconscious melody.\\" Option magazine note the album's focus on drones, textures and treatments of \\"a decidedly non-rock perspective\\". The album was inspired by the 1960s analogue electronic music of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, and songs which pay direct homage include \\"Owsley\\" and \\"The Stars Are So Far.\\" Writer Erik Morse wrote that the album \\"endeavoured to merge the electronic alchemy of Clara Rockmore, Louis and Bebe Barron, Richard Maxfield and Delia Derbyshire, with a traditional pop-song structure.\\" Kember's vocals on opening song \\"Feels Like I'm Slipping Away\\" are treated to present an \\"air of desperation among all the unworldly burbles and noises\\" according to Raggett, who also noted a contrast via the song's \\"pretty melody.\\" \\"The Stars are So Far (How Does It Feel)\\" is a remake of Spacemen 3's \\"How Does It Feel?\\"; the lyrics and delivery remain intact, but the Spectrum version uses synthesizers to create the song's psychedelic, rhythmic backing. Option described the song as resembling \\"a cross between Laurie Anderson's 'O Superman' and an episode of The Outer Limits. \\"Delia Derbyshire\\" is influenced by and named after the BBC Radiophonic Workshop musician of the same name. \\"Owsley\\" feature theremin and synthesiser tones ominously 'swirling' around a \\"demented vocal recitation,\\" contributing to a claustrophobic feel. The title track is spoken word in style. \\"The New Atlantis\\" mixes lyrics concerning \\"sound-houses\\" from Francis Bacon's novel New Atlantis with a repeating melody and spontaneous \\"blurbs and burbles.\\" It has been described one of the album's \\"blips-and-bloops\\" instrumentals. Release and promotion Forever Alien was released on 4 August 1997 in the United Kingdom by Space Age Recordings and the 3rd Stone imprint. In the United States, it was released by Space Age and Reprise Records. The cover of Forever Alien depicts the VCS 3, as played on the album, and the overall packaging of the album (designed by Andy Smith) has been described as a \\"love letter to synth technology.\\" While the Reprise edition features ten songs, including three songs from the Songs for Owsley EP, the British version appends alternate versions of the two remaining other songs from the Songs for Owsley EP, in addition to \\"Sounds for a Thunderstorm (For Peter Zinovieff)\\", a tribute to said composer. The album charted in neither the UK or US national charts. On the CMJ Radio Top 200 chart, compiled from reports of American college and non-commercial airplay, the album reached a peak of number 44. The record also concurrently peaked at number 37 on the equivalent CMJ Retail chart, compiled from sales reports from major American independent retailers. For the album's accompanying 1997 tour, Spectrum were joined by former Spiritualized member Will Carruthers, who also played on Spectrum's \\"Songs the Spaceman Taught Us\\" tour in 2001. To promote Forever Alien, \\"Feels Like I'm Slipping Away\\" was released as a single in the UK in September 1997, with \\"Forever Alien\\", \\"Dream Time\\" and \\"What Comes Before After?\\" as B-sides. The single was re-released in the US in June 2000 with the same track listing. Critical reception In a contemporary review of Forever Alien, Option wrote that \\"Sonic's idea of a good day is not worrying about having to tune a guitar. He's happy as a Venusian clam too, having steered his post-S3 band up into the ether.\\" Ned Raggett of AllMusic described Forever Alien as an album of \\"crackers,\\" highlighting the songs re-appearing from Songs for Owsley as being among the best. He also described \\"Feels Like I'm Slipping Away\\" as \\"amazing\\" and praised the song's \\"wonderful\\" contrasts. Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club praised the album's \\"keen gift for subconscious melody\\". Although he felt some of the instrumentals, such as \\"The New Atlantis\\", failed to gel into songs, and criticised the title track for being \\"self-serious goop,\\" he nonetheless conceded that \\"Kember usually gets his atmospherics to sound sufficiently creepy and compelling\\" throughout the album. In a list for The Quietus, electronic artist Ekoplekz cited Forever Alien as one of his 13 favourite albums. He said the album \\"probably had a lot to do with awakening my subsequent interest in Radiophonic music,\\" and felt the album's tribute to Delia Derbyshire was notable as \\"at the time [she] was barely remembered by anyone.\\" He also felt the album \\"had a lot to do with my music radar gradually shifting sideways into more esoteric areas beyond the formal conventions of techno-derived electronica.\\" Helena Hauff also cited Forever Alien as one of her 13 favourite albums in another list for The Quietus. She described it as \\"just a great listening album. Sitting at home listening to it is very relaxing, very interesting, very beautiful. It would be one of those albums I'd put on when I was in the mood also for Serge Gainsbourg albums.\\" In a 2011 interview, Kember said that Spectrum rarely play Forever Alien live as it requires a different set-up to their other material, due to the album's instrumentation largely relying on modular synths. He elaborated: \\"We don't play to a big enough audience that we can afford to travel all that [gear] around. It's pretty tough ‚Äî we do all the driving, we don‚Äôt have any road crew, we don‚Äôt have a sound guy.\\" Track listing All tracks written by Kember except where noted. # \\"Feels Like I'm Slipping Away\\" ‚Äì 5:32 # \\"The Stars Are So Far (How Does It Feel?)\\" ‚Äì 7:01 # \\"Close Your Eyes and You'll See\\" ‚Äì 6:03 # \\"Delia Derbyshire\\" ‚Äì 4:29 # \\"Owsley\\" ‚Äì 5:43 # \\"Forever Alien\\" ‚Äì 4:26 # \\"Matrix\\" ‚Äì 5:00 # \\"Like.....\\" (Kember, Sutcliffe) ‚Äì 5:09 # \\"The New Atlantis\\" (traditional, arr.

She was widowed four times and had a total of four children, including the Dutch painter Gabri√´l Metsu. She was a city midwife in Leiden, in the modern province of South Holland, and also worked as an independent midwife. She died in Leiden and had silver objects and three houses in her possession at the time of her death.  Biography  Garniers was born in roughly 1590, to Franchoyse Fremouts and Isack Garniers, in Ypres, West Flanders. She married Abraham Le Foutere on 5 June 1608, and they had 3 children. Foutere died in about 1618, and Garniers remarried to Guillaume Fermout, an artist, nicknamed Strazio Voluto. While she was married to Fermout, she moved to Dordrecht, Netherlands, and was trained there as a midwife. In 1624, Fermout died, and Garniers subsequently moved to Leiden, South Holland, Netherlands. In January 1624, Garniers became a midwife at Leiden after submitting a successful request to the court, but later decided to become an independent midwife. She married a third time on 10 November 1625, to Jacques Metsu, who, like Fermout, was an artist. The two of them had one child, Gabri√´l Metsu, who was raised as a Catholic. Gabri√´l painted a portrait of Garniers, which was sold in 1845 in London. Another portrait of Garniers which Metsu painted was sold on May 9, 1881, in Paris. On 6 March 1629, soon after Gabri√´l was born, Jacques died, leaving Garniers widowed again. In 1632, she asked to become a midwife of Leiden again and was accepted, with her salary being sixty guilders, twice the amount it was before. Her fourth husband was Cornelis Gerritsz Bontecraey, a skipper, whom she married on 14 September 1636. However, Bontecraey died as well in 1649, and Garniers became a widow for a fourth time. Garniers did not marry again after Bontecraey's death, but the skippers craft paid her two guilders a week so that she could help care for the four children she had. Garniers was able to acquire enough money to have three houses and multiple silver objects in her possession. She died in Leiden on 8 September 1651. It is believed that Garnier was also an amateur oil painter. Although no paintings made by Garniers have been found, it is suspected that she painted due to her second and third husbands being artists.

Her books were highly regarded and in great demand at schools in her time. Early life Anne Bullar was born in Southampton, Hampshire on 30 December 1812, as the fifth of the six surviving children of John Bullar, a schoolmaster and deacon in the Congregationalist church, and his wife Susannah, n√©e Whatman. Little is known of her life or education, although the family was well-educated. Her brothers became solicitors and doctors. Career Anne Bullar wrote at least six books, the first of which, Elements of Practical Knowledge or The Young Inquirer Answered, appeared by 1837, before she had turned 25. They were published anonymously in her lifetime, but appeared in her publisher Van Voorst's catalogues under her name after her death. They were reviewed in journals intended for readers in Britain's empire and armed services. Several were reprinted many times. The preface to Elements of Practical Knowledge describes the compiler as \\"the father (and instructor) of a family\\". It is not known whether Miss Bullar had compiled her father's questions and answers or taken on a male persona for publicity reasons. The author's set out to provide intelligible and correct information and assist those who had difficulty in answering children's questions. A second edition was published to meet demand, although one educator of the time disputed whether the knowledge was in fact \\"practical\\" in any way. Domestic Scenes in Greenland and Iceland, her second book, appeared in 1844. It was judged by one reviewer to be \\"written in a very attractive style, and well calculated to excite a desire for further information.\\" Another thought there was \\"nothing so well calculated to give children a correct notice of the countries\\". A recent, 2002 history of the Victorians' fascination with the Vikings takes a more critical view, summing it up as \\"a stodgy digest\\", \\"a pot-pourri of information\\", with \\"stern, no nonsense judgements: [such as]... 'wicked' ... 'cruel' ... 'silly falsehoods'\\". However, although Miss Bullar decried Greenlander traditions as \\"foolish\\", she continued, \\"perhaps if [Greenlanders] were to come to England, they might think some of our customs as silly, and as unbecoming as we think this of theirs.\\" In a time where foreign cultures were often characterized as \\"savage\\" or \\"unenlightened\\", Miss Bullar was more hesitant to judge the customs of other cultures, and seems to have been an early proponent of what has come to be called cultural relativism. Like her brother John Jr, Miss Bullar was also a sanitary reformer. Her third book, Every-day wonders; or, facts in physiology which all should know, stressed the importance of clean air, healthy food, posture, exercise, bathing, and dental care. It also stated that disabilities such as blindness and deafness did not detract inherently from someone's intelligence, giving Laura Bridgman as an example, and promoted adaptive accommodations such as sign language and the manual alphabet. Her fourth book, a history of England before the Norman Conquest, also received favourable reviews. One thought it \\"comprehensive and well-compiled\\", so that through \\"the excellence of the descriptions... this important history may thus be acquired with greater ease and advantage.\\" Another recommended it as \\"compendious... written in a plain and popular style, and well adapted for the instruction of the young\\". It was not universally acclaimed, however, with one reviewer finding it \\"too detached and disconnected\\" for its intended young readers. A Sunday book for the young; or, habits of patriarchal times in the East was the only book of hers with a religious theme. Intended to \\"explain... manners and customs... which sorely puzzle juvenile readers of the scriptures,\\" it was judged \\"a very pretty little book\\", \\"extremely good... [and] will be a favourite with children.\\" Her second book on the subject of physiology was published posthumously by a different publisher, Jarrold & Sons, for the Ladies‚Äô Sanitary Association. It appears to be a revision of Every-day wonders; or, facts in physiology which all should know, published twelve years earlier. While explaining the facts of physiology in language which the young would easily understand, she attributes these \\"Every-day wonders\\" to God, for example: \\"In this way God has so wonderfully contrived that the good and the bad blood should not be mixed.\\" This aspect received approbation at the time from those who thought \\"more means should be afforded for giving the children easy lessons in natural theology, showing them the evidences of the skill, power, and above all of the benevolence of the Deity, which were to be seen in the creation and government of the world.\\" Her books are early examples of writing specifically for the young and exhibit an understanding of developmental psychology. In them Bullar often takes care to choose analogies that a young person will understand and use language appropriate for them. Her comparison of the body's nervous system and the electric telegraph was approved in A study of the history of modern insomnia (2014), as \\"allowing anatomical fundamentals to be conveyed even in a children's book\\". Personal life During the 1840s, Bullar worked to raise money for the new Royal South Hants Infirmary. She died on 29 June 1856, aged 43, and was buried at St Nicolas's Anglican Church, North Stoneham. Selected works =Books= Six books are attributed to Bullar. Only one appeared under her own name during her life. After her death, they appeared under her name in her publisher's catalogues.

While Rinewalt was in later life deeply engaged in Republican politics, it was initially founded as an independent, nonpartisan paper. The paper quickly became the leading journal in the county, and by 1880, the paper had moved to larger facilities. Rinewalt ran the newspaper until his suicide on October 1, 1902. The paper was taken over by Rinewalt's wife and their son, Allan S. Rinewalt, until March 1907. In 1907, the paper was sold to Frank and his brother George Measer, who had worked for the paper as foreman the two years prior. George Measer operated the paper until his death in 1965, when his son George Jr. took it over. It was during George Jr.'s tenure that the Bee Group expanded, opening multiple local papers. After George Jr.'s retirement in 1994 his son, Trey Measer, took over. Trey remains the publisher, assisted by editor Anna DeRosa.

It is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, where it forms encrusting colonies on rocks and other hard surfaces. Description Oscarella lobularis is an encrusting sponge that forms a thick layer of soft, gelatinous consistency with a velvety surface, on rocks, stones and large seaweeds. Colonies are up to wide and thick, with an irregularly lobed surface. The sides of the nodular lobes have a scattering of ostia through which water passes into the sponge, and at the top of each, a single round osculum up to in diameter, through which water exits. This sponge has neither spicules nor spongin fibres in its tissues. It is usually some shade of yellow or brown but can occasionally be red, violet, green or blue, often with a cream-coloured base layer. Ecology Like other sponges, Oscarella lobularis is a filter feeder. Water is drawn into the interior of the sponge through the ostia, the bacteria and organic particles on which the sponge feeds are filtered out, and the surplus water is expelling through the osculi. This sponge is a hermaphrodite; ciliated larvae known as parenchymella larvae are liberated into the water and soon settle on the substrate and undergo metamorphosis into the adult form. This sponge can reproduce asexually. Colonies growing under overhangs can develop elongations that become shaped like tear-drops, dangle on threads of tissue and eventually detach, landing on the seabed below and growing into new colonies; the sponge has also been observed to develop bubble-like buds on its external surface which become detached and, being buoyant, are dispersed by currents in the water column and rapidly grow into new colonies. Research Oscarella lobularis has been used as a model organism for the study of evolutionary biology and developmental biology, being particularly suitable because of its easy availability, its simple histology and cell composition, its robust epithelial structures and because it lacks a skeleton. Researchers have studied the different colour morphs of this sponge which sometimes grow alongside each other. There appears to be a cryptic complex and two species that had been synonymised in 1877 have been redescribed as O. lobularis (violet in colour) and O. tuberculata; these species can be distinguished from each other cytologically, and by the former having a soft consistency and the latter a cartilaginous consistency. Several other new species have been described, mostly from caves.

He was responsible for overseeing the development of the International Hotel, and also was appointed as a director of Trans International. He soon became the president of International Leisure, a publicly traded company organized by Kerkorian to hold the International and Flamingo hotels.

Youth  Wichmann came to the first time to a youth detention center at the age of 14, after he had threatened a subtenant in his parents' house with a knife and tried to strangle her. At that time, Wichmann did not live at home, but grew up in care home in Wichernstift. But he did not want to stay there any longer, and stole money from place for his parents. The father was violent and is said to have mistreated his sons. At 16, Wichmann attacked a cyclist and sexually abused her, giving him six months of probation. In 1967 he threatened police officers with a small-caliber weapon and was sentenced to one year of juvenile punishment. In 1968, the 38-year-old Ilse G. was hit in the back while riding a bicycle in a forest near L√ºneburg with four shots from a small-caliber rifle, dying on the spot. Witnesses saw a youth who suited Wichmann's description flee, and the police filed a file on him. Although small caliber rifles and newspaper clippings were found in his possession, Wichmann was not charged. In 1970, he was sentenced to five and a half years of juvenile punishment for the rape of a hitchhiker, whom he also tried to strangle. The hitchhiker managed to persuade him to let her go. When Wichmann read the news in the newspaper, he felt misrepresented and went to the police to correct this, which led to his arrest.  Description  Wichmann was well known as a blond, down-to-earth man with a well-groomed appearance. A witness described him as a silent guy with cold, icy eyes eyeing everything. Others described him as an arrogant and egotistical loner. What was remarkable about him was that he always wore gloves and sunglasses. In one of his cars, an army sleeping bag for staying outdoors overnight was found, as well as binoculars and maps. In addition, he often stayed in the forest. He lived in a house in a cul-de-sac on the edge of L√ºneberg directly at the forest.Thomas Hirschbiegel: Zu Besuch im Grusel-Haus So lebte Serienkiller Kurt W., Berliner Kurier, 30. He grew up in that house, had a German shepherd and hung towards Fascists political attitudes (on his property he occasionally hoisted the Reichskriegsflagge). In the course of time he had also made several modifications, including secret caches and a door which led to nothing: you looked through it from above the garage and behind it was an attached gallows rope. At the time of the murder of Birgit Meier he was married, and his widow of 13 years died in 2006. He often needed money, and at the time of his death was overindebted and advertised himself as a callboy for porn magazines.  Disappearance of Birgit Meier  The crime against Birgit Meier was enlightened only 28 years after the request of her brother, the policeman Wolfgang Sielaff. Previously, for unknown reasons, traces that could have quickly led to Wichmann had not been tracked for years. In 1989, a few weeks after the disappearance of Birgit Meier, connections between Wichmann and her became apparent. Initially, the investigators suspected suicide or that it was the husband, but later focused the investigation on the L√ºneberg cemetery gardener Kurt-Werner Wichmann, whom the disappeared had previously met at a party, according to statements from the husband. He had previously done gardening work at Meier's neighbors. Wichmann was interrogated, and despite the flimsy alibi of being with his wife, it was not checked closely. He also concealed the fact that he was on sick leave at the time of Meier's disappearance, but the police did not ask further. Only with the establishment of a new prosecutor in L√ºneberg did further investigations began. In 1993, charges of suspected murder in Birgit Meier's case were brought against the gardner and the police searched his house. Investigators found two small- caliber rifles, a converted sharp gas pistol, stun guns, mufflers, handcuffs, sedatives and sleeping pills, as well as a secret torture room closed with a soundproof door, that only he and his brother were allowed to enter. There was a buried, bright red Ford sports coupe in the backyard, with blood clinging to its backseat. The body-tracking dogs were brought several times, but no bodies were found. Kurt-Werner Wichmann had fled the search. He was arrested in Heilbronn when he was involved in a traffic accident, with weapons being found at his vehicle.Thomas Hirschbiegel: Nach 23 Jahren .

Ten days after his arrest, the 43-year-old man hanged himself in the Heimsheim Prison.Thomas Hirschbiegel: Die Abschiedsbriefe des Serienkillers. He had already attempted suicide beforehand. He left strange farewell letters in which he asked, among other things, his brother clean the gutter. After his death, the murder series in the woods around L√ºneberg seized, and further investigation was discontinued. His vehicle and the items found in it were disposed of by police. Birgit Meier's remains were recovered in 2017 under the concrete floor of a garage of a house on the outskirts of L√ºneburg that Kurt-Werner Wichmann occupied in the past.Ziegler, Jean-Pierre: Die Leiche im Haus des Friedhofsg√§rtners Spiegel Online am 29. September 2018 On January 19, 2018, it became known thanks to an autopsy report from the Hannover Medical School that Birgit Meier had been shot.Gutachten der MHH: Birgit M. wurde erschossen bei ndr.de vom 19. The L√ºneberg Police President Robert Kruse stated that the perpetrator was a serial killer, who may have killed beyond Germany.Focus Online nach DPA Pressemitteilung, 19. He announced a thorough review of old cases, with Wichmann being considered as a possible suspect. As a result, analysts from the State Criminal Police Office of Lower Saxony filtered out 24 unsolved cases, in particular homicides and missings persons. In February 2018, the case was again featured again on Aktenzeichen XY ... ungel√∂st on television, as the investigators suspected that there was a helper, accomplice or a confidant.Polizei sucht weiter Mitwisser der G√∂hrde-Morde bei ndr.de vom 2.  Investigations  The success of slow police investigation was thanks to policeman Wolfgang Sielaff, the brother of the murdered Birgit Meier, when he began with private research in 2002 and found his sister's body in 2017. In the same year, the police set up a new six-member investigative force, which investigated Wichmann's connections with 24 other murder victims.  G√∂hrde Murders  In December 2017, 28 years after the murders in 1989, the Lower Saxony Police announced the former cemetery gardner Wichmann was a prime suspect in the G√∂hrde Murders, and that an investigation team was set up. DNA traces from one of Wichmann's stolen vehicles were assigned to the victims. According to police, this was a new track and not over the years examined hair.‚ÄûG√∂hrde-Morde‚Äú: T√§ter ermittelt, Fragen bleiben. The police assume that there is also an accomplice who may have committed other crimes. The essential clue for a second person involved in the case derives from the fact that Wichmann had driven his own motor vehicle into the G√∂hrde, but returned with that of the murdered. If somebody brought back his car is unknown. According to Sielaff's findings, there were 21 unresolved murder cases in L√ºneberg and the surrounding area, which could possibly be assigned to Wichmann by the perpetrator file and respective whereabouts.Gewissheit: Tote Birgit M. identifiziert. ndr.de, 24. To the assessment of police, who created a movement pattern for Wichmann, even murder cases in other areas could be assigned to him. Thus, after his release in 1975, Wichmann spent three years in Karlsruhe, where he lived with an elderly woman whom he had met through a personal ad during detention. During this time in the fall, several unsolved murders of hitchhikers occurred. Wichmann, who was very mobile and had five cars, could have been responsible.

Career Stringer has worked across a range of different areas of applied mathematics such as control systems, computational aerodynamics and epidemiology. He joined the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford in 1993, and he became director of the Oxford Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence in 2006. Research Stringer and his research group develop biological computer simulations of the neuronal mechanisms underpinning various areas of brain function, including visual object recognition, spatial processing and navigation, motor function, language and consciousness. In particular, the study published in Psychological Review and Interface Focus 2018, the Royal Society's cross- disciplinary journal, proposes a novel approach to solve the Binding problem. Spiking Neural Network simulations of the primate ventral visual system have shown the gradual emergence of a subpopulation of neurons, called polychronous neuronal groups (PNGs), that exhibits regularly repeating spatiotemporal patterns of spikes. The underlying phenomenon of these characteristic patterns of neural activity is known as polychronization. The main point is that within these PNGs exist neurons, called binding neurons, that learn to represent the hierarchical binding relationships between lower and higher level visual features in the hierarchy of visual primitives, at every spatial scale and across the entire visual field. This observation is consistent with the hierarchical nature of primate vision proposed by the two neuroscientists John Duncan and Glyn W. Humphreys almost thirty years ago. Furthermore this proposed mechanism for solving the binding problem suggests that information about visual features at every spatial scale, including the binding relations between these features, would be projected upwards to the higher layers of the network, where spatial information would be available for readout by later brain systems to guide behavior. This mechanism has been called the holographic principle. These feature binding representations are at the core of the capacity of the visual brain to perceive and make sense of its visuospatial world and of the consciousness itself. This finding represents an advancement towards the future development of artificial general intelligence and machine consciousness. According to Stringer: > Today‚Äôs machines are unable to perceive and comprehend their working > environment in the same rich semantic way as the human brain. By > incorporating these biological details into our models[...] will allow > computers to begin to make sense of their visuospatial world in the same way > as the [human] brain.

Bear Mountain is situated in North Cascades National Park. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Redoubt, to the northeast. Precipitation runoff from Bear Mountain drains into Bear Creek and Indian Creek, both tributaries of the Chilliwack River. Access, either by the Chilliwack River Trail or from British Columbia, Canada, is difficult and takes two to three days. Routes * Diamond Life * East Ridge * North Buttress Direct * North Buttress West * North Face Buttress * Northwest Buttress * Northwest Ridge * South Route * The Diamond * Ursa Major * Ursa Minor Climate Bear Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Bear Mountain (left) and Redoubt (right) The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The Neoclassical main building from 1824, a gatehouse from 1870, a barn from 1880, a stable from circa 1890 and a former horse mill were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1998. Another building is now operated as an arms museum under the name Egholm Museum. The estate covers 770 hectares of land. History =14th century ‚Äì 1640: Early history= Egholm traces its history back to the 13th century. Remains of a Romanesque castle is still seen at the site. It is believed that it was built for Jacob Nielsen, Count of Halland, a grandson of Valdemar II. Egholm is first mention in written records in 1405 when it was owned by Predbj√∏rn Podebusk. In 1419 he presented the estate to his nephew Henning Podebusk. In 1435, Henning Podebusk ceded it to his uncle's son Claus Podebusk. These transactions may, however, only have comprised a share of the estate since Hans Grubendal, who was probably married to Predbj√∏rn Podebusk's daughter Gisele Podebusk, in 1436, is also mentioned as owner of Egholm. Gisele Podebusk was later married to Jens Due, who was the sole owner of Egholm from 1460. Egholm was later ceded to the brothers Eiler and Niels Mogensen Hak, probably as an endowment by Gisele Podebusk and Jens Due. In 1484, Eiler Mogensen Hak acquired his brother's share of the estate. His widow Anne Nielsdatter became the owner of the estate after his death in 1501. It was later passed on to first their son Christoffer Hak and then in 1539 their daughter Lene Krafse (n√©e Hak). Egholm was after her death owned by members of the Krafse family for the next one hundred years. =1640‚Äì1804: Rosenkrantz and Skeel families= Oluf Rosenkrantz In 1640, Otto Krafse sold the estate to Holger Rosenkrantz. Holger Rosenkrantz 'The Wealthy', was one of the most wealthy noblemen in the country. On his death in 1647, Egholm was passed on to his son Oluf Rosenkrantz. He expanded the estate through the acquisition of many new tenant farms. He later established a new manor from part of the estate, naming it Krabbesholm after his wife's family. He was created Friherre in 1671. Egholm was granted the status of a birk that same year with the effect that it became an independent jurisdiction. Rosenkrantz fell out of favour at the court after opposing the new Absolute monarchy and was forced to cede all his estates to his daughters and sons-in-law. Egholm was ceded to Mogens Skeel but Oluf Rosenkrantz and his wife Birgitte Krabbe lived on the estate until their deaths in 1685. Mogens Skeel then sold the estate to his brother Otte Skeel. He increased the estate through the acquisition of more land. After Skeel's death, Egholm was passed on to his daughter Birgitte Skeel and son-in-law Otto Krabbe. They had no children and Egholm was therefore endowed to Iver Rosenkrantz. He was already the owner of a number of other estates. Iver Rosenkrantz died in 1745 and his widow Charlotte Amalie Skeel then owned the estate until her death in 1763. Their son Christian Rosenkrantz once again expanded the estate. He was also the owner of Krabbesholm, Ryegaard, Barritskov and Trudsholm. He endowed his estates to Niels Rosenkrantz with an obligation to establish a stamhus (family trust) from the estates. Stamhuset Rosenkrantz blev was established from Ryegaard, Barritskov and Trudsholm while Egholm and Krabbesholm were sold to his brother Marcus G√∏ye Rosenkrantz. He sold Egholm to count Christian Conrad Sophus Danneskiold- Sams√∏e and Lars Larsen just two months later. Lars Larsen became the sole owner of the estate in 1806 but sold it in 1809. =1812‚Äì1920: Haffner family= Wolfgang Haffner Johan Wolfgang Haffner acquired Egholm in 1812. By testament, he decided that the estate should be turned into a stamhus for the Haffner family in 1831. This was done by his son Wolfgang Haffner in 1831. The new main building He also constructed a new main building, expanded the forests and sold the tenant farms to the tenant farmers. After his death in 1887, Stamhuset Egholm was passed on to his eldest daughter Amalie Haffner. On her death in 1902, it was passed on to her younger sister, Ebba Wilhelmine Haffner, who was married to a Swedish count. The next owner was her son, Erik Alfred Wolfgang Haffner Piper, a Swedish count. =1920‚Äìpresent: Later history= The stamhus was dissolved as a result of the Lensafl√∏sningsloven of 1919. The main building and park were then disjoined from the home farm (avlsg√•rden) which was sold to the manager. The main building was sold to Axel Kaufmann. He later sold it to baroness Henny Caroline Wedell-Neergaard. Ole Falck, a great-great-grandson of Sophus Falck, founder of Falck, purchased the main building in 1988. He He later also purchased its former home farm, Egholm M√∏lleg√•rd and Egholm Skovg√•rd as well as most of the land that had previously belonged to the estate. Architecture The gatehouse The main building is designed in the Neoclassical style and is surrounded by moats. It is a simple, two-storey white-rendered building with a rounded avant-corps towards the garden. Windows and doors have sandstone framing. The building is topped by a hip roof with black-glazed tiles. The L-shaped former stable The main building from 1824, gatehouse from 1870, a barn from 1880, a stable from circa 1890 and a former horse mill were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1998. Surroundings The estate has a total area of 570 hectares and comprises Egholm Skov. Egholm Skovg√•rd and Egholm M√∏lleg√•rd are located close by. The forest contains two burial mounds from the Bronze Age. Some of the buildings are operated as an equestrian centre. Egholm Arms Museum Egholm Museum was inaugurated in 2012 and features Ole Falck's extensive collection of firearms and accoutrements. The museum starts with a display of exhibits about Danish and German soldiers and material from the occupation of Denmark during World War II. It is followed by exhibitions about the British, Russian and American troops. The section on World War II ends with an exhibition about the Danish resistance movement. The next section of the museum is dedicated to the Wild West. Exhibits include a stagecoach, a stuffed bison, antique weapons and artifacts from that time. There is also a large collection of hunting weapons and equipment with a poacher's home and various weapons used for poaching. The museum is also home to a collection of historic arms dating back to the 17th century. The collection also comprises a number of curiosities, such as the flag from Adolf Hitler's bunker in Berlin, Saddam Hussein's revolver and gas masks for horses.

Howe became a key figure in Oklahoma City bombing conspiracy theories following her claim that she informed authorities of a right-wing extremist plan to blow up a federal building in Oklahoma a few months before the Oklahoma City bombing. Early life Howe was adopted at birth by a wealthy family in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Her father, Bob Howe, was a former CEO of Mapco Incorporated, a Tulsa energy conglomerate. Her mother, Aubyn Howe, worked as a philanthropist. The family were members of Southern Hills Country Club.https://survivorbb.rapeutation.com/viewtopic.php?f=218&t;=2895https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/07/23/mcveighs- lawyers-keeping-eye-on-bomb-threat-trial-in- tulsa/b426a9ae-2c51-43e9-8109-242f8495551b/ After graduating from Tulsa Metro Christian Academy as an honor student, she lived in several places in the early 1990s, either taking college classes or working a variety of \\"non- career\\" type jobs. = Fall-in with the radical right = According to White Aryan Resistance member Dennis Mahon, Howe wrote to him in 1993 with an alleged interest in joining his group. Howe says she became involved with white supremacists in 1994 after allegedly being injured by a group of African-American men. According to Howe's lawyer, she then called Dial-A- Racist, a local hotline operated by Mahon. During her time as a white- separatist, she obtained a swastika tattoo on her shoulder and an iron cross on her leg. Time at Elohim City In 1994, Mahon began taking 24-year-old Howe to the white-separatist enclave in Elohim City, Oklahoma. While living on the compound for some months, she appeared on German television with Mahon to advocate violence as a means to reach the goal of a racially pure, white society. According to Robert Millar, the founder and spiritual leader of Elohim City, Howe stayed there approximately six weeks before the Oklahoma City bombing.https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/elohim-city-leader-admits-he- provided-fbi-with- information/article_6f9360dd-e479-526d-8c1e-31f45c2eab04.html Her relationship with Dennis Mahon had ended after he had apparently raped her, prompting Howe to flee to her grandfather's ranch in Texas. In August 1994, Howe filed a restraining order against Mahon. This attracted the attention of the ATF, who were already investigating Mahon's radical paramilitary group, W.A.R., for suspected violation of federal firearms and conspiracy laws. Carol Howe was then employed by the Bureau as a confidential informant. She was sent to Elohim City for the purpose of gathering intel related to their investigation. =Before the Oklahoma City Bombing= From August 1994 through March 1995, Howe served as an ATF informant going by the code number CI-183. She was paid $120 a week to monitor the Elohim City compound and wrote monthly reports to her ATF handler, Agent Angela \\"Angie\\" Finley-Graham. Carol Howe described the residents of Elohim City as ultra-militant white separatists with anti- government beliefs. She noted that the community had been sympathetic towards David Koresh, even having a Branch Davidian flag hanging in their church.https://extras.denverpost.com/bomb/bomb319.htm Howe says she informed her agency handlers, prior to April 19, 1995, that various Elohim City residents were planning an attack on Federal Buildings, which included the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Agency officials claim that Howe was deactivated because of mental instability. Finely-Graham states that Howe was reinstated in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, but did no informant work after June 1995.https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/viefhaus-convicted-of- conspiracy/article_9e865e73-b373-5b76-9b1f-a8a9cac8e2d4.html =Post-OKC Bombing= After the Oklahoma City bombing had occurred, Carol Howe was instructed by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms to return to Elohim City compound in order to obtain information regarding any possible connection between the residents of the community and the bombing. Starting on May 1 of 1995, she stayed on the compound for a total of three days before returning to her ATF handler to report her findings. On May 18, 1995, Howe was apparently banned from entering Elohim City by Robert Millar due to speculation that she had been a government informant. Testimony Howe was present at the Terry Nichols trial, where she testified that she saw Timothy McVeigh in Elohim City in July 1994 with Andreas Carl Strassmeir and Peter Ward. She also identified John Does #1 and #2 as brothers Pete and Tony Ward, both residents of the compound. She also that in the days following the bombing, ATF agents showed her a videotape of McVeigh, and she told the agents she had seen McVeigh at a Ku Klux Klan rally.http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a12101197okcothers#a12101197okcothers Judge Richard P. Matsch refused to allow Howe's testimony in Timothy McVeigh's trial in the Oklahoma City bombing case. National Socialist Alliance of Oklahoma Sometime after the bombing, Howe (using the name \\"Freya\\"), along with her then-fianc√©e, James Dodson Viefhaus Jr., formed a white supremacy organization in Tulsa, known as the National Socialist Alliance of Oklahoma, of which they were the only members.https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/former-opera-deb- indicted/article_a34fde80-a8b6-51fc-b036-a4e7c63e440e.html The group advocated the destruction of blacks, Jews, homosexuals and federal law enforcement agents. The alliance operated an Aryan Intelligence Network hotline on which Viefhaus had recorded a message sometime in December 1996 where he made a bomb threat. His message demanded so-called \\"white warriors\\" to take action against the U.S. Government and that failure to do so before December 15 (of that year) would result in bombs going off in 15 U.S. cities. Despite this, no bombs detonated. Viefhaus was arrested soon after he recorded this message in an answering machine at the Tulsa house he shared with Howe. On December 13, 1996, a search warrant was executed at the house the two shared. During a raid by federal agents, various items were found, which, according to FBI bomb expert Robert Heckman, could have been assembled into a pipe bomb with lethal potential. In addition to bomb ingredients, federal agents found several guns, books on how to construct weapons, and lists of alleged targets. Also found in the house was a picture of the couple, holding weapons and wearing swastikas on their clothing. =Trial= Howe had not been charged previously in connection with the December raid on the home, but at a hearing for Viefhaus, prosecutors had said they considered her \\"almost an equal threat\\". Howe says that she had set up the white supremacist hot line in 1996 to enhance her cover after federal agents disclosed her identity. During her trial, she explained to the jury that her life as a white separatist was only done as a pose to gather information as an undercover Government informer. She also testified that the capped pipe, black powder and length of fuse recovered from the home she shared with Viefhaus had been gathered during her work as an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Viefhaus was convicted of transmitting a bomb threat by a telephone answering machine and conspiracy to transmit the threat and was sentenced to 38 months in prison for conspiracy, making a bomb threat and possessing the components of a destructive device. Howe was found not guilty in a separate trial. Later Howe has since changed her name and is the subject of a Columbia Pictures movie project.

Early life and family Mary Ann Hutton was born Mary Ann Drummond in Manchester, England in 1862. She was the eldest child of James Drummond and Frances (n√©e Classon). She had two brothers and five sisters. Some secondary sources refer to her as Margaret, but in official records Hutton appears as Mary Ann. Her father was a Unitarian minister, initially at Cross Street Chapel but then at Manchester New College, London from 1869. Both her father and mother were prominent figures in the Unitarian community and amongst Irish dissenters. Her paternal grandfather was the poet William Hamilton Drummond and her uncle was the botanist and physician, James Lawson Drummond. Her father was an advocate for female suffrage. Hutton was well educated, and was one of the first women to attend the University of London, going on to be awarded the Hermann silver medal in German in 1882 and a Fielden scholarship. She married Arthur Hutton in Hampstead, London on 27 March 1890. He came from a prominent Unitarian family of Dublin coach- builders. He established a coach builders in Chichester Street, Belfast in 1886. The couple lived in Deramore Park, Belfast, with their one daughter, Margaret Bruce Hutton, born on 3 November 1893. Her husband, Arthur, died on 10 July 1908. Irish language activism It was at the Hutton's home in Belfast that Patrick Pearse stayed when he visited Belfast in December 1904. Hutton had known Pearse for a number of years through the Gaelic League, and had stayed in Rosmuc, County Galway at Pearse's cottage to improve her fluency in Irish. It is not known exactly when Hutton became interested in Irish, but she was corresponding with the Celticist Kuno Meyer by 1901 and is marked as an Irish speaker in the 1901 census. She spent time in the Irish speaking community in Glens of Antrim with her friend Rose Maud Young. Hutton was also involved in the establishment of the 1904 Feis na nGleann. She wrote for An Claidheamh Soluis at the request of Pearse, and is thought to have lectured on Middle Irish in Col√°iste Naomh Comhghaill and Ard Sgoil Uladh in Belfast. Hutton delivered the Margaret Stokes Memorial Lectures in Alexandra College in 1908, speaking on other worldly visions in early Irish literature. Hutton gave ¬£50 to the fund to establish Pearse's school, St. Enda's, and lent Pearse a further ¬£100 in 1911 when the school was struggling financially. Hutton was widowed in 1908, and having moved to Dublin, living at 17 Appian Way. Around this time she decided to convert to Catholicism. She lived in Dublin for the rest of her life, supporting Conradh na Gaeilge and was heavily involved in the city's cultural activities. In 1937 she was the representative of the Royal Dublin Society at the Celtic Congress in Edinburgh. Hutton's largest contribution of Irish scholarship was her 1907 edition of the T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge legend, The T√°in: an Irish epic told in English verse, with scholarly appendices of lexical names and terms. This is a re-working of the legend using numerous sources rather than a literal translation, and took 10 years to complete. The work was well received, going on to be re-published in 1924 with Celtic revival style illustrations by John Patrick Campbell as Seaghan MacCathmhaoil. Eoin MacNeill, Douglas Hyde and Louis Claude Purser supported an unsuccessful proposal in 1910 that Hutton be elected to the membership of the Royal Irish Academy. This was the first time that a woman had been nominated. In 1914 she was appointed to the senate of Queen's University Belfast, and in 1933 was awarded an honorary degree of D.Litt. by the National University of Ireland. Death Hutton died at her home at 30 William's Place Upper, Dublin on 29 August 1953. She is buried in Deans Grange Cemetery. The National Library of Ireland holds some of her correspondence.

It was released on September 30, 2008, through Bridge 9 Records. Release and reception Invasions of the Mind is the band Energy's first full-length studio album. It was released through Bridge 9 Records on September 30, 2008. It comes after the release of their 2006 EP Punch The Clock. The album was received with mixed reviews, being compared to early AFI, Ignite and The Misfits. In an AllMusic review, Greg Prato gives a positive take on the album, saying \\"There was a time when hardcore music was played solely by (and to) a bunch of shirtless and bald tough guys. But over the years, more mainstream sounds and approaches have infiltrated the style  to the point that \\"hardcore metal\\" groups have actually scored honest to goodness hit albums on the Billboard charts (which back in the '80s, would have seemed like a pipe dream). A good example of this aforementioned style would definitely be the Boston-based quintet, Energy, and their 2008 release, Invasions of the Mind. The speedy tempos and sometimes shouted vocals definitely point in the direction of hardcore. However, their almost Beach Boys-y harmonies, appreciation for penning a pop hook, and a sticky sweet production separate them from bands that specialize in nothing but good old- fashioned hardcore‚Äîespecially as evidenced on such tracks as \\"Hunter Red\\" and \\"Heaven.\\" While you wouldn't go quite as far as calling Energy \\"a hardcore boy band,\\" the group's leanings toward the mainstream are undeniable throughout Invasions of the Mind\\". Whereas, others would say the album fell short of the bands previously acclaimed EP Punch The Clock, calling the album mediocre with weak, overproduced, generic vocals.

Usage and History  Being a small apple, it was used for boiling and pickling. A hearty tree, it was also used for a grafting stock. According to a source published in 1905, the Tolman Sweet was one of several varieties that \\"were being grafted into the farm orchards in the older settled parts of the state [New York State] a century or more ago\\". Cross section of the apple Synonyms for the variety include: Brown's Golden Sweet, TALLMAN'S SWEET, TALLMAN SWEET, Tollman Sweet, TALLMAN SWEETING, Tollman's Sweeting, TALMAN SWEET, TALMAN'S SWEET, Talman Sweet, TALMAN'S SWEETING, TOLMAN, TOLMAN SWEET, TOLMAN'S SWEETING, TOLMAN SWEETING, Tolman's Sweeting. From the 1905 publication: \\"Fruit medium or below, rather attractive for a yellow apple. It meets with little demand in the general market, but is sold to a limited extent in special markets and to special classes of trade. The fruit is generally much esteemed for certain culinary purposes as pickling, boiling and baking. Its keeping quality varies in different seasons. In ordinary storage it is in season from November to January with December as the commercial limit. In cold storage its commercial limit varies under different conditions from February to April. Some find that it stands heat well before going into storage; others report that it does not. It shows bruises very readily and requires careful handling. The fruit hangs pretty well to the tree, is quite uniform in grade and suffers comparatively little loss in drops and culls. The tree is a good grower, long-lived and very hardy. Throughout Northern New York, Northern New England, certain portions of Canada and the northern portion of the apple belt in the prairie region of the Middle West, Tolman Sweet has gained the reputation of being one of the hardiest of the old New England varieties. For this reason it is often selected as a stock upon which to top-graft less hardy kinds. The tree comes into bearing at a moderately early age, and, generally speaking, is a reliable cropper, yielding from moderate to heavy crops biennially or sometimes almost annually.\\" The same source was unable to locate the origin of the variety, perhaps coming from Massachusetts. It was among the most popular sweet varieties in orchards in New York State at the time.

Visible from much of the town it was a local landmark with several traditions attached to it. The tree was blown over during a storm in February 2014, and despite efforts to save it, the tree was found to be dead in June 2015. The tree was voted Welsh Tree of the Year for 2014 and finished tenth in the European Tree of the Year awards for 2015. Seventeen saplings have been planted nearby in the hope that one will grow to replace the tree.  Description and history  The Lonely Tree was a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) located on top of the high Green Hall Hill overlooking the town of Llanfyllin in Powys, Wales and was visible from much of the town. The tree is thought to have seeded before 1815 and was classed as a veteran tree. The tree was in girth and was noted to have been suffering from decaying wood in its crown and from hollowing of its branches. The tree was a popular local landmark and also an attraction for hill walkers. The site was used as a scout camp site and part of the cross country course for the local school. It was also the site of one of the millennium beacons. Many traditions attached themselves to the tree with local people carving their initials on it, proposing marriage near it and having their ashes scattered there. The tree was used as the symbol of Llanfyllin Town Council.  Felling and replacement  The Lonely Tree was blown over by winds during a storm in February 2014. In an attempt to save the tree, locals brought between 30 and 60 tonnes of soil up the hill, using equipment donated by local companies, to place over its roots to prevent them drying out. There were hopes that the tree would regrow from the rootstock. Hundreds of people visited the site after the storm to pay their respects to the tree. Donations of several hundred pounds were received from Welsh expatriates towards the care of the tree. Llanfyllin town mayor Ann Williams said at the time: \\"The Lonely Tree is such a strong symbol of how much a community can stick together and keep something alive.\\" The tree received significant attention after it fell. It was voted \\"Wales's third favourite special place\\" in 2014 and in October of that year was entered into the Welsh Tree of the Year competition. The tree won the competition, and as a result, was entered into the European Tree of the Year competition in 2015, finishing tenth with 1,548 votes. Planning for a replacement of the tree by the town council began in April 2015 and discussions were held about installing a memorial plaque if it did not recover. In June it was confirmed that the tree had diedits remains were left in situ and seeds were taken from it in the hope of growing a new tree. By December of that year seventeen saplings had been planted in a new fenced enclosure nearby with the hope that at least one would survive to become as iconic as the Lonely Tree. One sapling was a descendant of the original tree, one was from seeds collected locally and the remainder were donated by a plant nursery.

His influential store, Dapper Dan's Boutique, operated from 1982‚Äì92 and is most associated with introducing high fashion to the hip hop world, with his clients over the years including Eric B. & Rakim, Salt-N-Pepa, LL Cool J, and Jay-Z. In 2017, he launched a fashion line with Gucci, with which he opened a second store and atelier, Dapper Dan's of Harlem, in 2018. Dan is included in Time magazine 's 100 Most Influential People of 2020. Early life Dan was born in Harlem, New York, in 1944, and grew up on 129th and Lexington Avenue with three brothers and three sisters. His father, Robert, was a civil servant and his mother, Lily, a homemaker. He is African American. He recalls horses and buggies still on the streets in his early childhood, in the post-World War II days of Manhattan. By age 13, he was a skilled gambler; his success as a gambler helped him finance his first store. In the 1960s, Day worked for a Harlem newspaper called Forty Acres and a Mule. He eventually became a vegetarian and gave up drinking, smoking and drugs. In 1968‚Äì74, he toured Africa as part of a program from Columbia University and the Urban League. Career =Dapper Dan's Boutique= When Dan returned to New York in 1974, he decided to be a clothier, and first sold shoplifted items out of his car. Dapper Dan's Boutique, located on 125th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues, opened in 1982, and at times was open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Dan originally planned to be a clothing wholesaler but soon faced prejudice as he ventured out. He struggled to buy the textiles and furs he needed, as most companies refused to do business with him because of his race or location. Instead of purchasing outfits to sell, he began teaching himself as much as he could about the industry so he could create his own designs from scratch. Dapper Dan's brash \\"knock-ups\\" used bootlegged fabrics he designed himself after teaching himself textile printing. Notably, he invented a new process for screen printing onto leather, and would later also design jewelry and car interiors for luxury automobiles. The opening of his store in the early 1980s coincided with the crack cocaine epidemic and the rise of hip-hop music, both of which boosted his clientele. Dan's trademark was his bold usage of logos from high-end luxury brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Fendi. Though his clothing was often referred to as streetwear, Day's early clients in the 1980s were inspired significantly by the fashion flamboyance of Rat Pack icons like Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. His main clientele were \\"hustlers and street people\\" ‚Äî including drug kingpin Alpo Martinez ‚Äî some of whom even requested bullet-proof parkas and hats. Day ventured into hip hop fashion in 1985, when he first styled LL Cool J, and Day has since been associated with hip-hop royalty. Eric B. & Rakim who wore Dapper Dan's designs on the cover of their iconic albums Paid in Full (1987) and Follow The Leader (1988). He also created looks for The Fat Boys, Salt-N-Pepa, KRS-One, Bobby Brown, Jam Master Jay and Big Daddy Kane, as well as sports stars such as boxers Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather, and athlete Diane Dixon. Day's illegal use of logos in his custom-made designs led to counterfeiting raids and litigation, and ultimately the demise of his first store. In 1988, Tyson got into a brawl with Mitch Green outside his store, which put Dapper Dan's in the media spotlight for the first time. After Tyson was photographed wearing a \\"knock off\\" Fendi jacket from Dapper Dan ‚Äî which was referred to as \\"an all-night clothing store that caters to performers\\" in The New York Times ‚Äî interest in the store eventually brought his usage of European luxury fashion logos to the attention of those retailers across the Atlantic. In 1992, after legal action by Fendi and then-U.S. Attorney Sonia Sotomayor, Dapper Dan's was shut down for good. He was shunned by the mainstream fashion world for decades, though he continued to work \\"underground\\" as a designer. He began outfitting Floyd Mayweather in 1999. =Resurgence= Day's career has been revitalized in the 2010s, and he has found mainstream success since 2017. In mid-2017, in an homage to Dapper Dan, Gucci's creative director Alessandro Michele designed a jacket based on a well-known Dapper Dan design for Diane Dixon in 1989. The original was a fur- lined jacket with balloon sleeves covered in the Louis Vuitton logo, which Michele replaced with the double-G Gucci logo. Social media reacted when Dixon shared a photo of the Gucci jacket next to her in the original one, with Dixon requesting that Dapper Dan get credit for his original; many believed that Gucci had stolen the Dapper Dan design, especially due to Gucci not stating it to be a homage until after they drew criticism. In 2017, with the support of Michele and Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri, Day and the Italian brand partnered for a line of men's wear. In 2018, Day opened a new atelier on Lenox Avenue in partnership with Gucci, Dapper Dan of Harlem, the first luxury house fashion store in Harlem. In popular culture In 2001, Dapper Dan was referenced in a Jay-Z lyric in his song \\"U Don't Know\\" from his album The Blueprint. In 2002, he was referenced multiple times in the Alpo Martinez crime film Paid in Full. In September 2016, prior to the premiere of the Netflix original series Luke Cage, Dapper Dan was featured in part of the \\"Street Level Hero\\" digital social video series to discuss Luke Cage, which is set in Harlem. In November 2017, he appeared in a segment on Conan for Conan O'Brien's stay at the Apollo Theater in which he styled the talk show host. Day's memoir will be published by Random House in 2019. Sony Pictures has already bought the rights to a film adaptation, with comedian Jerrod Carmichael attached as screenwriter and producer. Day will serve as executive producer of the film. Personal life Dan has eight children, William Day, Daniel Day Jr., Danique Day, Aisha Day, Danielle Day, Malik Day, Tiffany White and Jelani Day, who is the brand manager for his father.
