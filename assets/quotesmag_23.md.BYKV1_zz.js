It was founded in 2000 by Franco Dragone. Formerly known as Franco Dragone Entertainment Group (FDEG), the company became Dragone in 2014. The company, which based in La Louvi√®re, Belgium, has created in excess of forty \\"permanent shows\\", in addition to events in more than 12 countries across Europe, the Middle East, in the United States, South America and Asia.  History  = Origins = The company was founded in 2000 by Franco Dragone, who had acquired experience in the circus industry in the ‚Äô80s and ‚Äò90s, creating many shows with the Cirque du Soleil. Since its foundation, Dragone has been responsible for the creation and production of dozens of shows and original events. = Local anchorage = The company is based in the Belgian city of La Louvi√®re, the region where Franco Dragone moved to with his family when he was a young child in the 1950s. The presence of the company has showcased the city internationally, through local actions and events. Dragone has also captured attention due to the visits and participation of celebrities in their shows, such as Sting, Jeffrey Katzenberg or Celine Dion.  D√©crocher la lune  \\"D√©crocher la lune\\" is an event organised by Dragone, which seeks to combine entertainment and social concerns in a manner which includes participatory action by the community. In March 2000, the first such ‚ÄúD√©crocher la lune‚Äù was held in March 2000, in La Louvi√®re. Other iterations of the festival took place in 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2015. Since 2014, the scheme has been renamed to the ‚ÄúAgence Lunaire‚Äù, which is now responsible for the project.  5 sur 5  Created in 2004, the Festival 5 sur 5 offered young directors from around the world to express their point of view on La Louvi√®re through short films. The project was managed by the non-profit organization Espace Dragone, which represented the company's citizen base. The project successfully ran for thirteen consecutive years.  Economic issues and judicial difficulties  In October 2012, the company premises were searched. Franco Dragone is currently facing charges for tax evasion; the case is still under investigation and the judicial investigation is not complete. Between 2016 and 2017, an unfavorable economic environment resulted in Dragone experiencing significant cash flow difficulties. To maintain the activity in its Belgian base, and to save the jobs of its employees, the company engaged itself in a procedure in judicial reorganization (PRJ), which will be ultimately approved by the Commercial Court of Mons, which will pronounce the sustainability of the activity.  Shows  The so-called permanent shows are the hallmarks of the company. They are intended to be performed for a minimum period of 10 years, typically in theaters specifically built for Dragone shows. The shows heavily incorporate technology and special effects. These shows include several types of performances inspired by traditional and contemporary circus. Dragone has specialized in the development of aquatic theater, under the stage of which hides a swimming pool of several million liters, allowing the use of a third play area, in addition to the aerial and aquatic ones. The shows are intricately developed by various teams within the company, including the following units: Casting, Talents & Trends, Architecture & Design, Illustration and Video, Costumes. Shows organised by the company include the following that can be broadly categorized into three divisions: = From Las Vegas to Dubai =  A New Day...  In March 2003, the new Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas held the premiere of Celine Dion‚Äôs A New Day..., a show created and directed by Franco Dragone. Celine Dion had previously seen and loved O and she even temporarily moved to Belgium so the two could closely collaborate on the show she dreamed of... In this show, says the artistic director, ‚ÄúI see Celine as a satellite that captures the images of another world and sends them back to the audience. The stage becomes a secret universe that she shares very intimately with the audience‚Äù; while Celine Dion thinks the world of its ‚Äúmagician‚Äù. The show was performed every night for five years in front of a full house.  Le R√™ve  In 2005, Le R√™ve , entirely conceived in the workshops of La Louvi√®re, took place in the setting of Steve Wynn‚Äôs casino hotel, the Wynn Las Vegas. The aquatic scene is surrounded by more than 2000 seats and contains over 3500m¬≥ of water. The dome rises 25m from the stage. This show is very intimate despite the technical means implemented, since the farthest of the two thousand spectators, in the fourteenth row, is only twelve meters from the stage.  Lido - Paris Merveilles  Among the projects, contacts were gradually established with the owners of the Lido, a famous cabaret located on the Champs-√âlys√©es and the service company Sodexo. And in the beginning of 2013, the first auditions were held in Paris. The new performers of the troupe were selected during a rigorous casting process while the Lido transformation work started. In March 2015, the day before the premier, the costumes created by Nicolas Vaudelet were transported to Paris for the final fittings. When the curtain rose a completely new show was presented to the audience; a revue of a new kind, very rock, leading the audience to discover an eternal Paris to the music of Saule and Yvan Cassar, other faithful accomplices of Franco Dragone.  La Perle  The premiere of ‚ÄúLa Perle‚Äù took place on September 13, 2017 in the heart of the Al Habtoor City Resort. La Perle is the first Las Vegas style permanent show of this scale in the UAE, performed in an aquatic theater, designed by Jean Rabasse and the Dragone Studio, with 1300 seats and 450 performances a year. For the artistic director Franco Dragone, La Perle is intended to present Dubai as ‚Äúa laboratory of the future where people of diverse cultures create something spectacular together‚Äù. Several celebrities like Sheikh Mohammed bin Rachid Al Maktoum, Lindsay Lohan and Ronaldinho attended the show. = Asian adventure =  The House of Dancing Water  In the fall of 2010 in the theater of extraordinary dimensions of the complex ‚ÄúCity of Dreams‚Äù, Macau, the premier of, ‚ÄúThe House of Dancing Water‚Äù (THODW), a permanent water show, took place. Created, designed and developed in La Louvi√®re and rehearsed in Alfacam's studios, near Antwerp, Belgium, marked the beginning of a new milestone in the history of Dragone: the entry into Asia. This first show on Chinese soil came about after a meeting between Franco Dragone and Lawrence Ho, co-chairman and CEO of Melco Crown Entertainment, which will open a new resort ‚ÄúCity of Dreams‚Äù. During the first five years of its operation, THODW welcomed more than 3 million spectators and won four prestigious awards in the world of design and international marketing. The Macau experience confirmed the international vocation of the Company. In the process, the company is implementing a completely new type of contract and of an unprecedented scale with the powerful Dalian Wanda Group, the Chinese leader in commercial real estate development, luxury hotels and cultural industry, and chaired by Wang Jianlin. This contract covers the design, creation, production and operation of several unique shows in different Chinese cities, for a minimum of ten years  The Han Show  The Han show has been paying tribute to the essence of Han culture since opening in December, 2014. The lantern-shaped theater that houses the show has forever changed the urban landscape of Wuhan, capital of the Hubei Province. Inspired by the typical lines of the so-called ‚Äúred lanterns‚Äù, the theater was designed by world-renowned architect Mark Fisher and his team at Stufish. The theater is more than 70 meters high and 100 meters wide on each side offers pedestrians and spectators a real outdoor show with the ballet of lights illuminating its facade. At the beginning of each performance the 2000 spectators discover the swimming pool, which holds 10 million liters of water, hidden under the stage thanks to a unique system that allows the seats to move, modifying the configuration of the room. The 95 artists, from all disciplines, selected by the casting department at Dragone, perform 10 shows per week. Now, in Langfang, near Beijing, in a studio built to train the artists for the show, training and formation is being developed with the support of a Beijing's university, on a model that should extend to other regions of the globe.  The Dai Show  In 2015, Dragone created and produced the second show commissioned by the Wanda Group. The Dai Show is a tribute to a world where man still lives in harmony with nature: that of the Dai people. This is the traditional beneficial energy that fueled the show and inspired the construction of its theater in Xishuangbanna, southwest China, on the border with Burma and Laos. = Time for diversification = Over time, the company progressed in the diversification of its activities. Departments within the company, such as the illustration department or Dragone Costumes can take on contracts independently of the parent company. For example, for Holliday on Ice - Ice Age and Peter Pan - The Never Ending Story, in Abu Dhabi. While the main company is venturing into new challenges such as cabaret, touring shows with singers, lyrical art (training, opera creation) or the artistic direction of theme parks.  Taboo  Between 2012 and 2015, Dragone invested in the world of traditional cabaret with the show Taboo. Mixing sophisticated and sensual choreography with sexy acrobatic performances, Taboo invited the audience to a mischievous trip to ‚ÄúCubic‚Äù, the Cabaret set up in the heart of Macau's City of Dreams complex. Audiences could witness pole dancing, striptease, hand-to-hand, dance and performances involving fire highlighted by an important work on sound, light and especially video projections. The biggest names in Cabaret and Burlesque contributed to the fame of Taboo, such as Dita Von Teese and the Bluebell Girls from the Lido in Paris.  Me  For the second time in more than a decade, Dragone created a show for the popstar: Philip Kirkorov, a Russian artist who has won 5 World Music Awards. For this creation entitled ‚Äú–Ø‚Äù (Me), the 30 songs of the show were all revisited to breathe new life into Kirkorov's popular hits, without betraying their original spirit, deeply rooted in the Russian soul. The premiere of the Kirkorov's international tour took place on March 18, 2016, in the prestigious theater of the Grand Kremlin Palace.  The Land of Legends  Franco Dragone managed the artistic direction of an innovative theme park, in a partnership with the Rixos Hotels group. The Land of Legends, Turkey‚Äôs largest theme park, opened during the summer of 2016 in the city of Antalya. For Dragone, this opportunity allowed him to develop a creative concept, characters, performances and a world where the visitor, as the viewer on other stages, is invited to enter the park and experience their own legend.

History  Lagos State College of Health Technology, formerly known as School of Hygiene was established in 1920 by Dr I. Oladipo Oluwole based on the prevailing health situations and low human health resources available in the community. The then School of hygiene offered six major health courses before incorporating the training of community midwives and nurses into its program between 1957 and 1966. On the 21st of February, 1977, Lagos State College of Health Technology, under the directive of the Federal Military Government was transformed from a School of hygiene to a School of Health Technology as a result of the Third National Development Plan (1975 ‚Äì 1980) on National Basic Health Service Scheme (NBHSS) which mandated the train middle level manpower for the health sector. On the 22nd of January, 2004, Lagos State College of Health Technology's establishment was assented by the former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the Lagos state college of health technology's governing council was constituted and inaugurated in July, 2012 by Babatunde Raji Fashola‚Äôs Administration  Governing Council  The governing council of Lagos State College of Health Technology is usually led by a chairman, representative of the ministry of education and 2 members of the teaching staff of the college.

This species of fly is most known for sex role reversal during courtship, as females put on exaggerated displays and congregate in leks to attract males. Females cannot hunt for food, so they receive protein from nuptial gifts brought to them by males. Female dependence on males for nutrition is the principle cause for sex role reversal in this species of fly.  Description  = Males = While this fly species is termed the long-tailed dance fly and its Latin nomenclature resembles the same meaning (Rhamphomyia = ‚Äúcrooked fly;‚Äù longicauda = longtailed), the ‚Äútail‚Äù actually references the male genitalia, which forms an elbowed erection towards the rear of the abdomen. A male R. longicauda with protruding genitalia, commonly referenced as its \\"long tail\\" Common to many male Diptera, the dorsal section of the eyes is larger than the ventral section. The lengthened dorsal section, in addition to shortened wings, aids the male‚Äôs ability to approach the female from beneath during mating. = Females = Females have black scales that protrude forwards and backwards on their middle and hind legs. They also have small hairs that cover the sides of the legs and tan abdomens. In comparison to males, females have larger and inflatable pleural sacs, larger wings, thorax length, and hind tibial length, which are the principal sexually dimorphic body parts. The ventral region of the female retina is larger than the dorsal region, which helps them locate encroaching males that are pursuing mating.[2] Males prefer females that have longer wings and shorter tibiae.  Territoriality  During the mating season (May-July), females congregate in leks 10 minutes before sunset and remain together for up to 40 minutes just after dawn or before dusk. Females return to the same lek every night, even if already inseminated, unless there is significant inclement weather, like continued rain or winds above 14km/hr. Unique to this species, the lek site is not a grounded surface; they hover above the aggregation site in a horizontal plane .3 m-.6 m above the ground/vegetation under an opening in an otherwise enclosed canopy.  Food resources  Females cannot hunt for food: they only receive protein from nuptial gifts brought to them by males. Female dependence on males for nutrition is the principle cause for sex role reversal in this species of fly. Males hunt an hour before sunset within a range of 30m from the lek site. They rapidly scour the area in a figure-8 flight pattern looking for food. The mayfly is a common prey of R. longicauda Males will eat any prey they can find, but they normally capture swarming insects. More specifically, most tend to prey on flies (Diptera), which make up 70% of their combined prey. They also feed on mayflies (Ephemeroptera) and caddisflies (Trichoptera), and infrequently feed on male ants, moths,[2] and mosquitoes. The size of their captures varies significantly, ranging from 2-4.5mm in one 5-year study.  Mating  = Courting = Before entering a lek, females rest on nearby vegetation and swallow air to inflate expandable pouches on the sides of the abdomen. The size of the abdomen is made to look even bigger by wrapping their large, scaly legs around their abdomen. Males enter female leks and discriminate first for female wing size. Model experiments showed that males give sexual preference to females with larger abdomen size. In females, there is a positive correlation between larger pleural sacs and greater egg length/number. Female abdomen size has evolutionarily correlated with extent of egg maturation in other species of Rhamphomyia, and females take advantage of this pre-established male preference to gain mates. Overall abdomen size does correlate to more developed egg maturity in R. longicauda, but inflation decreases the accuracy of body size as an indicator of egg maturity by 49%, making this a deceptive signal to entice males. = Leks = A female R. longicauda waits on nearby vegetation to fill her pleural sac with air before entering the lek Females form leks in groups of 10-100 at sites under openings of an otherwise closed canopy. They return to the lek site every night to continue receiving nuptial gifts from the males; no virgins are found after almost two weeks of lek formation. Females hover over the lek site to provide them with backlighting so that they appear as silhouettes in order to exaggerate their size and deceive males. Stratification within leks was observed, as females with larger tibiae hover at lower positions in the swarm to receive the most copulations. Males never enter a lek without prey but go immediately to lek sites after catching prey. They enter leks from below, or if they arrive before the females congregate, they fly by the swarm area several times and wait on nearby vegetation. Once females congregate, males fly below the females until she drops to him to receive his nuptial gift and mate. = Copulation = Males pass through the female swarm several times before finding a suitable mate. The male then ascends directly beneath the female about 1-2cm below her, at which point the female drops down to the male. The two then fly away together at a faster speed away from the swarm, during which time the male gives the female the nuptial gift and recedes into copulating position. Flight pace slowed at the beginning of copulation. Nuptial flights last about 40 minutes. = Female-female interaction = Larger females hover at lower positions in the swarm to receive the most copulations. Horizontal positioning was also of importance, as central females also gained from more frequent encounters with males. However, unlike many male leks, females do not engage in physical altercations to receive better positioning within the lek. = Assortive mating = Females with the largest ornaments typically are more likely to attract a male in R. longicauda, and larger males typically mate with larger females, as they can bare their weight during the nuptial flight. During copulation, males must withstand the weight of the female and the nuptial gift during the flight, and because of this, there is no directional selection for increased body size or ornament size (pinnate leg scales and pleural sacs). Rather, female R. longicauda undergo stabilizing selection, as too large of female lowers fecundity since many males will not be able to perform copulation with excessively large females.  Enemies  = Predators = Longjawed Orbweavers), common predator of R. longicauda The tetragnatha spider is a known predator of dance flies. It makes webs on the periphery of female swarms, making flies near the edge of the swarm more vulnerable to attack. = Victim dispersal = Another consequence to the sex role reversal is that females are also preyed upon at a higher frequency than males. Despite not foraging for food, more females are killed by spiders even in locations where both sexes are traversing because of the risky flight patterns females perform in order to get attention from males. This includes flying closer and more erratically towards nearby vegetation where spiders lay their webs. Researchers also note that the enlarged ornaments may also trigger higher predation rates. Neither enlarged ornaments nor risky flight patterns are observed in male dance flies.

However, the opposition has grown - through the 2013‚Äì2018 Nicaraguan protests - to denounce Ortega and demand his resignation, becoming one of the largest protests in his government's history and the deadliest civil conflict since the end of the Nicaraguan Revolution. On 29 September 2018, political demonstrations were declared illegal by President Ortega. More of 2,000 protests events were part of this significant mobilization.  Background  = Pensions for small contributors = The 2013‚Äì2018 Nicaraguan protests began in June 2013 when some elderly people with only a small contribution (less than 750 weeks) demanded a reduced pension from the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute. Soon, students and young people joined their protests. After a week of demonstration, the peaceful protesters were attacked by paramilitary groups associated with the Sandinista Youth, while police had moved back only moments before. Later, to calm down the protests, concessions to the pensioners were made by president Daniel Ortega to supply a reduced pension. = Proposed canal= Over a year later protests started again, this time opposing the construction of a proposed Chinese-funded inter-oceanic canal through Nicaragua, with environmental impact, land use, and indigenous rights, as well as Nicaraguan sovereignty among the chief concerns of demonstrators. By February 2018, the project was widely viewed as defunct,China Sets Its Sights on South America. Seth Cropsey, The American Interest. Quote: \\"China has abandoned its attempts to construct a Nicaraguan Canal to compete with its Panamanian counterpart.\\" though a 60% absent vote to revoke the 2013 legislation creating the project, the Chinese company (HKND) granted the concession to develop the canal maintains legal rights to it as well as to ancillary infrastructure projects. = Forest fires= In early April 2018, demonstrators marched in Managua, the country's capital, to protest what they regarded as an insufficient government response to forest fires that burned 13,500 acres (5,500 hectares) of the Indio Ma√≠z Biological Reserve, a tropical nature preserve that is home to Rama and Kriol indigenous people, as well as significant biodiversity and endangered species. There were suspicions that the government had an interest in the fire, as it is the largest natural reserve through which the Nicaraguan Canal is planned to make. Counterprotests also occurred at the time in support of the Sandinista Front government. = INSS crisis= In 2013, the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute was in a deficit situation that had been grown annually, reaching 2,371 million Nicaraguan c√≥rdobas by the end of 2017. This deficit has increased by over 50% annually for the last two years. The IMF alerted Nicaragua in 2017 that in the absence of the reform, the cash reserves would be depleted by 2019. The government of Daniel Ortega prepared a reform plan for the INSS based on the IMF's report. The government rejected some of the proposed remedies, such as increasing the retirement age, arguing that older people have fewer possibilities of finding employment, and that the urgency of the reform required fast results to ensure the INSS's viability, as some measures suggested by the IMF would not yield results for three or four years. In early April 2018, the Superior Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP) announced the start of negotiations with the government to reform the INSS, declaring that the solution must include an increase to the contribution of the employers and employees, as well as fiscal reform. These negotiations excluded small and medium-sized enterprises. The reforms were announced on 16 April 2018, and published by presidential decree in March 2018 in La Gaceta (official government record) on 18 April 2018. The reform included an incremental increase of 0.75% (from 6.25% to 7%) on the employee contribution and 2% (from 19% to 21%) on the employers, starting July 2018. The employers' contribution would increase annually until reaching 22.5% in 2020. Pensions would also be taxed 5%. The 5% tax has been criticized as unconstitutional, since only the National Assembly has the power of taxation, and Law 160, signed by Ortega, indicates that pensions are not subject to any retentions. The government- aligned unions Workers' National Front and the Employees National Union supported the reform, while the COSEP rejected it, indicating it did not have consensus and filed a writ of amparo in an attempt to reverse it.  Timeline of events  =Start of protests= Citizens protest on 18 April after already being angered by the handling of the fires in response to the Ortega administration's announcement of social security reforms that raised income and payroll taxes while reducing pension benefits by 5%. Demonstrations involving mostly elderly individuals, university students, and other activists broke out in Managua and six other cities, which were repressed by authorities reporting to President Ortega. Authorities were seen using live ammunition on protesters while also arming Sandinista Youth members with weapons. At least 26 people were killed, including journalist of the news program Meridiano, with Gahona being shot to death outside of the city hall in Bluefields while streaming on Facebook Live. Various forms of independent media were censored during the protests. National University of Engineering loading ammunition in Managua, 19 April 2018. The following day on 19 April, Vice President and first lady Rosario Murillo made a speech mocking the demonstrators and labeling them of \\"small groups, small souls, toxic, full of hate\\", bent on the destruction of the country, assaulting peace and development. She also labeled the demonstrators that had been attacked as \\"aggressors\\" and the attack by pro-Ortega groups and police as \\"legitimate defense\\". Protests began to intensify with confrontations occurring in Le√≥n, Managua, Granada, Boaco, Carazo, Estel√≠, Rivas, Matagalpa and Masaya. TELCOR ordered the suspension of transmissions of four independent TV channels that were reporting the news: channels 12, 23, 51, and 100% Noticias. Also the Catholic Episcopal Conference's TV channel. The suspension lasted several hours, except for 100% Noticias, who was off the air until 25 April. Murillo accused the protesters of being manipulated and trying to \\"destabilize\\" and \\"destroy\\" Nicaragua. Two days after the beginning of protests and the subsequent crackdown by authorities, Ortega made his first public appearance on 21 April and announced he would hold negotiations for a possible revision of the reforms, planned to take effect on 1 July 2018; however, he stated he would meet only with business leaders and alleged that demonstrators were being manipulated by gangs and other political interests. Demonstrations increased in response, with protesters objecting to the repression of demonstrations and the exclusion of other sectors from the negotiations, as well as the reforms themselves. The COSEP business chamber announced it would only participate in the negotiation if police violence ceased, detained protesters were released and free speech were restored. Nicaragua's Roman Catholic Conference of Bishops also called for an end to the police violence and criticized unilateral reforms; Pope Francis subsequently added his call for peace in the country. = Cancellation of social security reforms = As the press began to describe the unrest as the biggest crisis of Ortega's presidency, Ortega announced the cancellation of the social security reforms on 22 April, acknowledging they were not viable and had created a \\"dramatic situation\\". He again proposed negotiations on the issue, which would now include Catholic Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes as well as the business community. On 23 April, marches of citizens, businessmen and students were held in Managua demanding the end of violence in the country, the release of students arrested by the police, the cessation of censorship of television media, and a response from the government about the students who died during the protests. The protests were the largest seen during the Ortega administration, with tens to hundreds of thousands of demonstrators participating and calling for the president's resignation. The next day on 24 April 2018, detainees were released by Nicaraguan authorities as a result of dialogue between the government and other organizations. = Investigations and resignations = Nicaraguan Attorney General In√©s Miranda announced on 26 April that a formal investigation into the deaths during the protests. On 27 April, President of the National Assembly Gustavo Porras announced a truth commission to examine the deaths and violence during the unrest. Head of the National Police Aminta Granera announced her resignation in face of the criticism of her handling of the unrest and alleged police repression of protests. = Protests intensify = Hundreds of thousands participated in marches for \\"peace and justice\\" organized on 28 April by the Catholic churches in Nicaragua in the cities of Managua, Matagalpa and Le√≥n. At the events, \\"bishops, feminists, homosexuals, family members of those killed in the repression... and thousands of peasants\\" gathered in unity to demonstrate. Peasants who lived in rural areas traveled to Managua by a caravan of trucks, arriving to protest against the Nicaragua Canal proposal by Chinese businessmen and the Ortega government. Days later on 30 April, tens of thousands of Ortega's supporters participated in a rally showing him support, though there were some reports of government workers being forced to join the pro-Ortega rally. The rally consisted mostly of singing and dancing to music of the 1960s and 1970s, popular to the former Sandinista guerrillas. On 2 May, police in riot gear blocked a student march from Central American University (UCA) to the National Assembly, with students instead marching to the Polytechnic University of Nicaragua (UPOLI) to show solidarity with other groups entrenched there. After pro-Ortega groups appeared on their route, they cancelled another planned march, so students reinforced barricades surrounding UPOLI under the watch of authorities. Anonymous Nicaragua hacked the website of the National Police of Nicaragua, calling for them to support of anti-Ortega protesters. The next day, elite troops of the Nicaraguan armed forces and police assaulted UPOLI in the early morning at about 01:00 CT, dispersing students stationed at the university. The incident left six students injured, one seriously. Student group Movimiento 19 de Abril responded to the incident stating that they would not participate in a dialogue with Ortega after he sent forces to attack them, placing peace talks in jeopardy. By 9 May, members of the independent press of Nicaragua condemned the killings, censorship and repression of the Government of Nicaragua. More than 10 cities were the scene of heavy fighting on 12 May in at least eight departments in the north, center, and Pacific areas of Nicaragua. The biggest clashes took place in Chinandega, Granada, Le√≥n, Managua, Masaya, and Rivas in the Pacific, as well as Estel√≠ and Matagalpa in the north. In Masaya, the clashes lasted for more than 12 hours between demonstrators, anti-riot police and youth shock groups of the Sandinista party. The following day, President Ortega called for a cessation of violence, reading a short statement, in which he called for \\"an end to death and destruction, that does not continue to shed blood of Nicaraguan brothers\\". The Military of Nicaragua assured that it would not engage in acts of repression against citizens who were protesting and advocated a dialogue to help resolve the crisis in the country, according to statements made by spokesman Colonel Manuel Guevara. In a demonstration, thousands of people arrived on 13 May from Managua to Masaya in a caravan to support that city for the loss of at least one life and 150 wounded in the past days. = National Dialogue = After weeks of conflict, the National Dialogue began on 16 May 2018. When Ortega and Murillo arrived at the Seminary of Our Lady of Fatima, the site of the national dialogue, the presidential couple was greeted with shouts of \\"assassins, murderers\\" by people on the outskirts of the event. A delegation from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) arrived in Nicaragua on 17 May to observe in loco the situation of human rights in the country. The IACHR visit occurred as Nicaraguan human rights organizations were reporting between 61 and 67 people dead and more than 500 injured in the repression exercised against protesters. The delegation was headed by Antonia Urrejola, rapporteur for Nicaragua at the IACHR. On 18 May, the second day of dialogue, the IACHR now included in talks called \\"on the State of Nicaragua to immediately cease the repression of the protest, the commission also calls on the State to guarantee the independence and functioning of the media in the country\\", the rapporteur said, also indicating that the mission of the IACHR in the country will be the observation in the field in accordance with human rights. She indicated that she would meet with all sectors. There was friction between university students and members of the state-media press before the dialogue. The government and the Nicaraguan opposition agreed to a truce over the weekend, a month after having started demonstrations and protests. Several people appeared before the Inter-American Commission to lodge complaints against the violations carried out by the police forces and supporters of the Daniel Ortega government. The national dialogue continued on its third day on 21 May where the resignation of Ortega and his wife and the Nicaraguan government was requested in order to return the country to normality. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), issued a preliminary report on the investigations of what happened in the protests in Nicaragua. The IACHR counted at least 76 people killed in the protests in Nicaragua and more than 800 injured, and denounced serious events and violations of human rights by the Government of Nicaragua. It included the official visit of the IACHR to Nicaragua. The representatives of the organization were in Managua, Masaya, Le√≥n and Matagalpa. A week after beginning, the National Dialogue between the government of Nicaragua and students, the private sector and civil society was suspended indefinitely. The leader of the Nicaraguan Catholic Church, Bishop Leopoldo Brenes, who had acted as a mediator of this dialogue, explained that the lack of agreement on an agenda of issues to be discussed prevented negotiations from continuing. = Clashes begin = On 30 May, the day on which the Nicaraguan mothers are celebrated, a march was held in honor of the victims killed during the protests. It was repressed by the national police in the company of paramilitary groups and pro-government mobs, leaving approximately 15 dead. Most of the victims died from accurate shots to the head, neck and chest. The march was led by the Mothers of April Movement, the Student Movement 19 April, Civil Society and Private Enterprise. In the early hours of 1 June, there were reports in Masaya of a new wave of looting and robberies against businesses and stores in the city. Movements, associations of professionals and Nicaraguan social groups called for a civic-citizen national strike and civil disobedience since 1 June, as a means of pressure for President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, to leave power. Five banks have closed in Masaya for lootings. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) condemned the deaths and new acts of violence that occurred in Nicaragua and urged the state to stop the repression of the protests. The IACHR also urges the government to investigate and punish the use of force by parapolitical actors, dismantle these groups, and seek a peaceful, constitutional and democratic solution to the current political crisis affecting the country. On 8 July, at least 38 were killed during skirmishes between protesters, authorities and pro-Sandinista paramilitary groups, raising the death toll to more than 300 Nicaraguans killed since the beginning of protests. = Attacks on bishops and opposition = Mobs, some hooded and armed, set out on 9 July surrounding and assaulted Catholic bishops, including Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, Auxiliary Bishop Silvio Jos√© B√°ez, and the ambassador of the pope in Nicaragua Waldemar Sommertag, after arriving in Diriamba, Carazo. Men in plain clothes, hooded and some armed, first verbally offended the religious and then attacked them physically, wounding some of them, while the journalists robbed and beat.elnuevodiario The next day, Vice President of Nicaragua, Rosario Murillo, said that the government presiding over her husband, Daniel Ortega, is \\"indestructible\\" and that the opposition \\"could not\\" defeat him, while also justifying the actions of violence against the Nicaraguan bishops and the apostolic Nuncio in Diriamba. On 11 July, the Nicaraguan opposition and academic Felix Maradiaga was attacked in the city of Le√≥n (northwest Nicaragua) by a group of Sandinista sympathizers of the government of President Daniel Ortega. = Church of Divine Mercy incident = Police and paramilitaries attacked the Rub√©n Dar√≠o University Campus (RURD) of the UNAN Managua on 13 July. After hours of facing attacks, more than 100 students took refuge in the nearby Church of Divine Mercy where they were fired upon by police and paramilitaries, after the youths left the facilities the paramilitaries set fire to the university campus setting fire to a CDI and one of the pavilions of the college The Church of Divine Mercy was then the target of attacks and was besieged throughout the night of Friday the 13th and into the early morning of Saturday the 14th, leaving two students dead. The bullet holes in the walls, windows and religious objects in addition to the bloodstains were still visible in the days following the attack. On 14 July, clashes were reported in Granada, Masaya and Managua. Leaving two students killed by Nicaraguan police and pro-government paramilitary forces had to go with the presence of Cardinal Brenes, the apostolic Nuncio accompanied by members of the national and international organizations to rescue the wounded and besieged. Those rescued were received at the Cathedral of Managua, where they were received by ecclesiastical authorities and national and international human rights organizations. In the cathedral were also dozens of people waving flags of Nicaragua and UNAN to receive the students. = Government stands firm = As a result of crackdowns in July 2018, the government forced people from protest centers and established a more firm presence in Nicaragua, though protests still continued in the following months. The international community intensified pressure on the Government of Nicaragua on 16 July in order to stop the repression and disarm the paramilitaries after nearly 300 deaths during three months of protests demanding the exit of President Daniel Ortega. The United States, 13 Latin American countries and the Secretary-General of the UN, Antonio Guterres, demanded Ortega to end the repression of the demonstration. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also denounced the Law on Terrorism that was recently approved by the pro-Ortega Parliament of Nicaragua, which it said can be used to criminalize peaceful protests. On 17 July, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua raised its \\"strongest protest\\" for the \\"biased declarations\\" of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, defending the Law on Terrorism. Days later on 24 July, President Ortega said that he will not resign from the presidency of Nicaragua before finishing his term in 2021, ignoring the demand of opponents who demand his immediate exit from power to overcome the crisis. = National lockout= An early-September general lockout organized to demand the release of political prisoners saw 90% participation of businesses in Nicaragua. It was estimated that the national lockout cost the country $20 million to $25 million per day. = Ban on protests = On 29 September 2018, President Ortega declared that political protests were \\"illegal\\" in Nicaragua, stating that demonstrators would \\"respond to justice\\" if they attempted to publicly voice their opinions. The United Nations condemned the actions as being a violation of human rights regarding freedom of assembly.  December raids  In December 2018, the government revoked the licenses of five human rights organizations, closed the offices of the cable news and online show Confidencial, and beat journalists when they protested. The Confidential newspaper and other media were seized and taken by the government of Daniel Ortega Several service stations of the Puma brand were closed in the afternoon of 20 December by representatives of the Nicaraguan Energy Institute (INE), a state entity that has the mandate to regulate, among others, the hydrocarbons sector. Puma Energy entered the Nicaraguan oil and fuel derivatives market at the end of March 2011, when it bought the entire network of Esso stations in Nicaragua as part of a regional operation that involved the purchase of 290 service stations and eight storage terminals of fuel in four countries of Central America. On 21 December 2018, the Nicaraguan police raided the offices of the 100% News Channel. They arrested Miguel Mora, owner of the Canal; Luc√≠a Pineda, Head of Press of 100% Noticias; and Ver√≥nica Ch√°vez, wife of Miguel Mora and host of the Ellas Lo Dicen Program. Subsequently, Ver√≥nica Ch√°vez was released. Miguel Mora and Lucia Pineda were accused of terrorist crimes and provoking hatred and discrimination between the police and Sandinistas.  The application of the Democratic Charter  The Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS), Luis Almagro, announced that he will begin the steps for an eventual application of the Democratic Charter to the State of Nicaragua, which would isolate the country from the inter-American community.  Dialogue  = National Dialogue = The National Dialogue began on 16 May. Ortega kicked off the \\"dialogue for peace Wednesday\\" saying, \\"We all suffer the death of our loved ones, but we have the obligation not to respond to violence with more violence, because otherwise we have scales that end in wars, and the people are tired of that.\\" Students led with a strong demand. \\"We have decided to be at this table to demand them right now to order the immediate cessation of the attacks that are happening in the country,\\" said student leader Lesther Alem√°n, as protests continued throughout the country. After hearing the student, Ortega questioned the wave of protests, calling it \\"irrational violence\\". Monse√±or Mata made three requests to Ortega. On 23 May, the National Dialogue was suspended. Archbishop Brenes suggested to create mixed commission of three representatives by each part to discuss an action plan to restore the table of the National Dialogue. The Nicaraguan Foreign Minister, Dennis Moncada Colindres, objected that the agenda of the National Dialogue involves 40 points that all lead to a single point; an agenda for a coup d'√©tat for a change of government outside the constitution and violating the laws of the country. On the other hand, the university students, businessmen and civil society asked that a Framework Law be debated, which would allow to advance the elections, prohibit the presidential re-election and change the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE). Following the repression and over a dozen deaths in the 30 May protests, the Nicaraguan archbishops cancelled the National Dialogue and protests continued. = IACHR resolution = The Inter- American Commission on Human Rights adopted precautionary measures of protection for the entire leadership that make up the University Coalition in Nicaragua and that have led the civic protests against the government since 18 April. The US government urged Nicaragua to fully implement the recommendations of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) to prevent further violence in the protests against the government of President Daniel Ortega.  Protest violence  325 people have been killed as of 6 February 2019, as a result of the Nicaraguan government's repression of protests. At least 42 people were killed in the first week of protests in April, with most injured by bullet wounds. Nicaraguan authorities used live ammunition to fire upon demonstrators resulting in hundreds of injured. Government forces were also reported to have armed pro-Sandinista groups with weapons to use against protesters. Following the government crackdown, rioting and looting ensued. On 2 May 2018, The Miami Herald reported a total dead of \\"At least 63 people, almost all of the student protesters\\" since the start of the demonstrations. By the end of May, over 105 people killed. As of 4 April 2019, between 325 and 568 have died over the period of the protests. The United Nations Human Rights Council condemned what they said may have been possible \\"illegal executions\\" performed by the Nicaraguan government. In July 2018 police arrested the mayor of Mulukuku and accused him of being involved in the deaths of three police officers. = Torture = Individuals detained during protests alleged torture by the Nicaraguan authorities, with hundreds of prisoners later released by the roadside in the outskirts of Managua with shaved heads and bare feet. The Inter-American Human Rights Commission received allegations about some families being forced by the government not to file complaints about the deaths of their family members, mistreatment of detainees and threats against human rights defenders in the Central American country.  Alleged foreign support  Many protesters tortured have reported hearing both Cuban and Venezuelan accents in the clandestine prisons operated by the Nicaraguan government.  Media  There were reports of media organizations being censored during the protests. Miguel Mora, the director of 100% Noticias de Nicaragua, stated that the Nicaraguan government censored his channel on cable networks in the country. The censorship of 100% Noticias was not lifted until 25 April. One journalist, , was shot and killed while reporting on the protests on Facebook Live. Radio Dar√≠o, a radio station known for being critical of the Ortega government, was said to be attacked and burned down on 20 April 2018 by pro-Ortega groups, leaving the facility at a total loss. The United Nations Human Rights Council criticized the attacks on media and censorship performed by the Ortega government. The Inter-American Press Association also called on the Ortega administration to stop its efforts of censorship, with its president Gustavo Mohme Seminario stating that its actions toward the media \\"unmasks the authoritarianism of a government that in its eleven years in power has only sought to dismantle the State for its benefit and that of his family members\\".  Cyberattacks  Anonymous Nicaragua, a group of the Anonymous movement, joined the protests against the government and launched Operaci√≥n Nicaragua, or #OpNicaragua. The operation consists of a campaign of cyber attacks against Nicaragua's government web pages or accused to be related to it. The campaign started on 26 April with an attack that left the National Assembly website out of service. The attacks continued against the websites of Juventud Presidente, Canal 2, and the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic, the Nicaraguan Institute of Civil Aeronautics, Nicaraguan Institute of Culture, El 19 Digital or Canal 6. The state agency Nicaraguan Institute of Telecommunications and Postal Services (TELCOR) cited the corporations that provide the internet service to see what actions to take to form a unity against hackers. TELCOR summoned these providers to a meeting to address security measures to take around the cyber attacks executed by the international hackers against web portals of the government and private corporations.  Medical dismissals  The Nicaraguan Medical Association (AMN) denounced the alleged arbitrary dismissals of 146 doctors, specialists and subspecialists of the state health units, as a form of retaliation for their participation or support in the protests carried out in the last three months. With clashes, a medical march in Nicaragua has ended against the dismissals for treating the wounded during the protests against the Ortega government since last April.  Teacher dismissals  The dismissal of state teachers who support the demonstrations against the government caused an act of \\"student disobedience\\" in the city of Condega, in the north of Nicaragua, which is going through a crisis that has left between 317 and 448 dead since last April. Marist Institute students refused to enter the classrooms, in rejection of the decision of the Ministry of Education (Mined) to dismiss several of their professors \\"because they have their own criteria and do not support the murderers\\", informed the Student Movement 19 of April- Condega.  Flight of Nicaraguan citizens  Since the end of July and the beginning of August, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship and the Directorate of Immigration and Foreigners of Costa Rica reported a moderate increase in the entry of Nicaraguans into Costa Rican territory. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), an average of 200 Nicaraguans per day apply for asylum in Costa Rica, overwhelming the country's immigration authorities. In addition, the Commissioner reported that about 8 000 Nicaraguan refuge requests have been reported since the beginning of the protests. Among the Nicaraguans who have sought refuge in Costa Rica are several university leaders, who fled Nicaragua after constant threats that forced them to leave the country. Among them the university leader Victor Cuadras Andino. The Vice President and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Costa Rica, Epsy Campbell, reported that more than 1,000 Nicaraguan refugee claims have been denied, in order to avoid an immigration crisis and to prevent the entry of illegal persons and maintain security in the region. On 3 August 2018 Nicaraguan singer-songwriter Carlos Mej√≠a Godoy reported that he left his country because his life is in danger as part of protests against the government of President Daniel Ortega, of whom he is critical and adding to the hundreds of Nicaraguans who have refuge request The Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights (ANPDH), highlighted in the rescue of injured, detained or harassed protesters in the Nicaraguan Protests of 2018 announced on Sunday 5 August 2018 the temporary closure of their offices due to serious threats and siege by illegal armed groups sponsored and supported by the President of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo. The flight from Nicaragua of the human rights activist √Ålvaro Leiva, after the popular singer-songwriter Carlos Mej√≠a Godoy, for threats attributed to pro-government groups, triggered the alarms between humanitarian agencies, the UN and the OAS. Representatives of the Special Follow-up Mechanism for Nicaragua (Meseni) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (Acnudh) discussed this situation  Budget  Nicaragua cut its spending budget for 2018 by $186.3 million, 1.3% of its GDP, in the midst of the crisis. An amendment sent urgently by President Daniel Ortega mainly affects public investment programs, health and education portfolios, and transfers to municipalities, according to the project approved by the FSLN deputies and their allies.  OAS Working Group and New Protests  The Organization of American States (OAS) approved the creation of a 'working group' for Nicaragua, whose mission will be to support the national dialogue and contribute to the 'search for peaceful and sustainable solutions' for the crisis, the bloodiest since the 1980s. Nicaragua closed its doors to a Working Group of 12 countries created by the Permanent Council of the OAS, which seeks to support the national dialogue and contribute to the search for solutions to the crisis in the country. The government of President Daniel Ortega declared the presence of that Working Group for Nicaragua unacceptable, which he described as an \\"interventionist Commission.\\" While so many protests continue in the capital and several departments of the Central American country. Affiliation to the INSS is in a tailspin: Nicaragua retreated to 2005 Villagers who were demonstrating in the municipality of Santa Mar√≠a, in Nueva Segovia, were kidnapped by Sandinista paramilitaries. Citizens participated in a march against the government of Daniel Ortega.  Alleged household searches  Several families claimed to have had their homes searched without a warrant from Nicaraguan Paramlitary and Police forces. Video footage of the alleged incident was released from their neighbours, which showed paramilitary groups exiting the premises and leaving on national police vehicles. The video does not make clear what those groups were doing prior to their exit.  Expulsion of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  The president of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, has expelled from the country a mission of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which denounced the \\"high degree of repression\\" of the protests against the Government. announced the president of the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights (CENIDH), Vilma N√∫√±ez, who described as \\"unprecedented\\" the decision of the Government of Daniel Ortega, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua said in a statement that \\"they stopped the reasons\\" they gave walk to that invitation.  NCHR legal personality cancellation  The National Assembly of Nicaragua, canceled the legal personality of the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights (Cenidh), the main organization of its subject in this country, which has denounced the abuses and misuses of the Government since April, when The demonstrations that demand the departure of the former Sandinista guerrilla began. This decision, considered a \\"revenge\\" by activists, is a blow to an organization with a long history in the defense of human rights in the Central American country, which has made it worthy of several international recognitions. The legal personality of Hagamos Democracia was also canceled, an organization dedicated to, among other activities, overseeing the actions of the Nicaraguan Legislative Body. Previously, it had canceled the legal personality of the Institute for Strategic Studies and Public Policies (IEEPP), which directs Felix Maradiaga and the feminist organization Information and Health Advisory Services Center (CISAS), run by feminist Ana Quir√≥s, who three days earlier had been expelled to Costa Rica, by orders of the government of Nicaragua. Accusing them of terrorism and putschists fact that has outraged international organizations. The Sandinista parliamentary majority, composed of 70 deputies, has canceled the legal status of three Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), including the Institute for the Development of Democracy (Ipade), which is headed by Mauricio Z√∫niga.The other two organizations that have been canceled this morning are the Segovias Leadership Institute Foundation, led by Hayde Castillo and the Foundation for the Conservation and Development of the South East of Nicaragua (Fundaci√≥n del R√≠o), directed by Amaro Ruiz.  Expulsion of international human rights organizations  The Nicaraguan government headed by Daniel Ortega expelled two missions of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), after accusing them of acting in an \\"interventionist\\" and biased manner in their assessment of the country's situation in the context of anti-government protests, The country remains \\"practically without independent human rights bodies,\\" declared the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, claiming to be \\"very alarmed\\" because the Government of Nicaragua has expelled two MESENI institutions from the country. the GIEI * -established by the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights.  Hard report from the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts (GIEI)  Repression, torture and sexual assault \\"among other crimes. It has been eight months since the last wave of protests against Daniel Ortega's government in Nicaragua began, and the crisis does not seem to subside. The demonstrations have already left at least 325 dead and hundreds injured and detained.

Protesters generally were spread across the political spectrum, and Murillo's statements angered the left-wing sector, which responded by destroying her metal \\"Trees of Life\\" public art pieces in Managua. The majority of those demonstrating do not see any negotiation without the results being Ortega's removal.  Domestic NGOs  The NGO Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights (CENIDH) stated that President Ortega and his wife \\"encouraged and directed\\" the repression against protesters and that \\"the demonstrations are legitimized by a social rejection of the authoritarian way of governing by President Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo\\" and called for dialogue monitored by the United Nations and the Organization of American States. = International =  Supranational bodies  * ‚Äì On 20 April 2018, the Delegation of the European Union in Nicaragua and the Heads of Mission of the Embassies of the Member States released a statement lamenting the recent violence, sending condolences to those affected, and calling for dialogue and \\"social peace\\".

In a statement, the Foreign Ministry notes that the ambassador of Panama in Nicaragua, Eddy Davis, keeps in touch with the truckers who are stranded in Nicaragua, as a result of which they have not been able to leave that country due to the constant protests and closure of the street that the Nicaraguans maintain against the government of Daniel Ortega.

In the midst of the political crisis in Nicaragua, which amounts to more than 350 deaths in three months of intense protests, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza offered official support to \\"defend\\" the sovereignty of the Central American country. \\"President Daniel Ortega, if the revolutionaries of Venezuela had to come to Nicaragua to defend Nicaraguan sovereignty and independence, to offer our blood for Nicaragua, we would go like Sandino to the mountain of Nueva Segovia,\\" he said during the commemoration of the 39 years of the Sandinista Revolution, in which the foreign ministers of Venezuela and Cuba were the only representatives of the highest level who accompanied Ortega. * ‚Äì The Netherlands cancelled aid for the Nicaraguan government due to \\"severe violations towards the human rights, committed by government officials and paramilitary groups\\". * ‚Äì Luxembourg suspends aid to the Nicaraguan State.

But these statements did not fall well in some sectors of the Latin American left and generated the reaction of Chavez leader Diosdado Cabello who criticized him on Thursday in a television audition. \\"Do not you realize Pepe what is happening in Nicaragua at this time? It's the same thing that they did to Venezuela?\\" Said Cabello. *Gustavo Petro ‚Äì In a tweet, former Colombian presidential candidate Gustavo Petro stated that \\"In Venezuela as in Nicaragua there is no socialism, what there is is the use of left-wing rhetoric of the 20th century to cover up an oligarchy that steals the state, a minority that governs for itself and violates the rights of the majority\\" * The Colombian Senator of the Political Group List of the Decency, Gustavo Bol√≠var, published a trill in which he questions Maduro and Ortega, but also criticizes the situation that Colombia is facing in terms of human rights, especially for the murder of social leaders. \\"In 100 days of repression, the Ortega dictatorship killed 305 people. In 125 days of protests, the Maduro dictatorship killed 131 people. In Colombia, without dictatorship, they have killed 342 social leaders,\\" said Bolivar. * US congressmen Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario D√≠az Balart met with members of the Nicaraguan community in South Florida to discuss the crisis in that country.

BPPs are phytases, which means that they are able to remove (hydrolyze) phosphate groups from phytic acid and its phytate salts. Hydrolysis happens stepwise and usually ends in myo-inositol triphosphate product which has three phosphate groups still bound to it. The actual substrate of BPPs is calcium phytate and in order to hydrolyze it, BPPs must have Ca2+ ions bound to themselves. BPPs are the most widely found phytase superfamily in the environment and they are thought to have a major role in phytate-phosphorus cycling in soil and water. As their alternative name alkaline phytase suggests, BPPs work best in basic (or neutral) environment. Their pH optima is 6‚Äì9, which is unique among the phytases.  Potential uses  As of April 2018, BPPs are not used commercially, but they may have potential for such use. Histidine acid phytases (HAPs) are the only group of phytases which are used in animal feed at the moment. = Animal feed = Recombinant phytases are added commonly in agriculture to animal feed of monogastric animals to enhance the feed's nutrient bioavailability. These nutrients include phosphorus which is bound to phytates in the form of their phosphate groups. In contrast to ruminants like cattle, gut bacteria of monogastric animals like pigs and chickens can't properly hydrolyze these groups free so that the digestive system of the animal can use the phosphorus. Unabsorbed phosphorus is thus wasted and may end up into the environment in animal manure via agricultural runoff and cause eutrophication. Phytic acid can also work as an antinutrient: it can chelate calcium from feed and decrease its bioavailability up to 60‚Äì70% of the feed's total calcium content. Phytase addition improves calcium availability and can also improve the bioavailability of iron and zinc. It might also increase the availability of copper and manganese. Amino acid bioavailability is not enhanced significantly. In comparison to histidine acid phytases (HAPs), which are often unstable in temperatures higher than 65 ¬∞C, BPPs can naturally withstand high temperatures of 80‚Äì85 ¬∞C. Such temperatures are commonly used in pelleting of animal feed during its manufacture. Unlike HAPs, BPPs have a neutral or alkaline pH optima, which makes it possible to use them in neutral or alkaline environments. This expands potential applications for phytases. BPPs could be used in aquatic animal feed because many of these animals like fishes and shrimps have a neutral or alkaline gastrointestinal tract. BPPs are also phytate specific unlike HAPs, which hydrolyze also other phosphate containing molecules like ADP, GTP and NADH. However, BPPs are catalytically more than 2‚Äì60 times slower than current the HAPs. HAPs have a specific catalytic activity of 100‚Äì3000 U mg‚àí1. BPPs usually have a specific catalytic activity of less than 50 U mg‚àí1. Because of such low activity practical use of BPPs requires much more research.  Structure  As of April 2018, 7 BPP crystal structures were known: 3AMR, 3AMS, 1H6L, 1POO, 2POO, 1CVM and 1QLG. Masses of known BPPs are approximately 35‚Äì68 kDa. Their donut-shaped Œ≤-propeller structure consists of 6 antiparallel beta sheet structures or \\"blades\\". One of these blades has 5 Œ≤-sheets (blade number 5 in the picture in the beginning of this article) and the rest have 4 Œ≤-sheets. There are hydrophobic interactions between these blades which are thought to keep the propeller structure together. These blades form a tunnel-like hole through the enzyme. This tunnel binds some water molecules. In front of the tunnel is the enzyme's active site which is positively charged in total due to Ca2+ ions it binds and certain positive amino acid residues. This site binds negatively charged calcium phytate and hydrolyzes phosphates from it. = Motifs = BPP motifs found by Huang et al. shown in a BPP (PDBID: 1H6L). Actual highlighted motifs are DAADDPAIW (red) and NNVDIRY (green). A 2008 study by Huang et al. compared 66 BPP peptide sequences and found that sequence motifs DA[A/T/E]DDPA[I/L/V]W and NN[V/I]D[I/L/V]R[Y/D/Q] were conserved in all of the studied BPPs. R[Y/D/Q] for example signifies that R and Y, D or Q were found in the sequence, i.e. RY or RD or RQ. 2014 study by Kumar et al. compared 44 BPPs and found 10 motifs. Two of these, DDPAIW[VI][HN]PK[DN]P[ESA]KS and NN[F/V]D[I/V/L], were found in all of the studied BPPs. These were noted to be similar to the ones found in the 2008 study by Huang et al.  Calcium dependence and inhibitors  BPPs are calcium dependent metalloproteins. Their active site has a number of calcium cations (Ca2+) bound to it via negatively charged amino acid carboxylate groups. Positive calcium ions are needed to make binding of the negative phytate electrically favorable. Binding happens via phytate's negatively charged phosphate groups along with certain positive amino acid residues of the BPP which bind directly to the phytate. Ca2+ concentrations also have an effect on BPP pH optima and thermostability: e.g. with Bacillus sp. KHU-10 BPP the activity is highest with 10 mM of added CaCl2 at 60 ¬∞C and pH 6‚Äì9.5. Without added CaCl2 the pH highest activity is at 40 ¬∞C and pH 6.5‚Äì8.5. Removal of Ca2+ leads to the loss of catalytic activity which is why Ca2+ chelating EDTA inhibits BPPs. Certain point mutations of the calcium binding amino acids also stops enzyme function. Divalent ions like Cd2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Ba2+, Hg2+, Zn2+, Co2+ and Fe2+ inhibit BPPs by replacing Ca2+ within the enzyme. This is probably due to the fact that these cations are too small in comparison to Ca2+ ions, which have a Van der Waals radius (WDV) of 0.99 √Ö. Co2+ has VDW of 0.74 √Ö for example and is thus probably too small to carry out the same tasks that Ca2+ can. However, Sr2+ ions can replace Ca2+ at least in certain cases without total loss of catalytic function. Sr2+ VDW radius is 1.12 √Ö, and is similar to that of Ca2+. Similar compatibility between different ions can be seen in some other enzymes, too. High Ca2+ concentration can enhance BPP catalysis rate up to a limit. When Ca2+ concentration surpasses this limit, extra Ca2+ ions begin to work as competitive inhibitors. High concentrations of free phytate which not bound to Ca2+ also inhibits BPPs. This happens possibly via free phytate mediated chelation of the Ca2+ bound to BPPs. Other types of inhibitors include oxyanionic (oxygen binding) molybdate, tungstate and vanadate. It has been suggested that inhibition with these oxyanions happens because they form trigonal bipyramidal complexes within the active site of the enzyme which are similar to the transition state of the phytate's phosphate group during its hydrolysis. Orthophosphate which is released from phytic acid works as a competitive inhibitor of BPPs. Phytic acid analogue myo-inositol-hexasulphate (IHS) inhibits BPPs and this has been used as an aid in BPP structural studies due to its similarity with phytic acid (see 3AMR).  Hydrolysis mechanism  In a hydrolysis mechanism suggested in 2001 by Shin et al. the Ca2+ ions bound to the BPP are divided to hydrolysis and affinity site ions. In the hydrolysis site, Ca2+ help the phosphate about to be removed bind to the active site. They also activate a water molecule that participates in the hydrolysis by turning it in to an OH‚àí ion and stabilize the transition state during catalysis. Affinity area ions increase phytate affinity to the active site and keep the phytate still during hydrolysis from its other phosphate groups. Hydrolysis is repeated stepwise until a myo-inositol product with three phosphates is obtained. Other studies support product with three phosphates, but more phosphates can be removed under extreme conditions such as high BPP concentration and lengthened incubation time. BPP hydrolysis mechanism. It has been suggested that oxyanions like molybdate form complexes similar to the transition state of phosphate hydrolysis (only intermediate state is shown in the picture). Actual hydrolysis suggested by Shin et al. happens in two steps. Second one is slower and limits the total reaction speed. In the first step carbonyl group withdraws electrons from phosphorus of the phosphate making it electron poor, i.e. leaving it with a positive charge. Simultaneously OH‚àí donates an electron pair to the nominally positive phosphorus in phosphate. A trigonal bipyramidal intermediate state is formed. In the second step phosphoester bond is cleaved when an acidic amino acid residue (BH+) donates a proton to the oxygen in the bond. Phosphate group is thus cleaved off.  Hydrolysis routes  Multiple suggested hydrolysis routes exists, but it is uncertain which one is correct or if multiple routes exist. These hydrolysis routes are summarized below. Suggested BPP hydrolysis routes. Extreme conditions mean high BPP concentration relative to phytic acid concentration and/or lengthened incubation time. Routes begin with phytic acid (Ins(1,2,3,4,6)P6) or its salt, calcium phytate. E.g. Ins(1,3,5)P3 has phosphate groups bound to carbons 1, 3 and 5.

Club career =Early career= Kabongo started playing for hometown club Albertslund IF before signing a youth contract with Br√∏ndby IF. During his time in the youth teams, Kabongo was a part of the under-17 team that won the championship and the domestic cup. On 31 August 2017, Kabongo moved to second division club Fremad Amager on loan until 1 January 2018. He made his first- team debut for Fremad on 3 September, coming on as a substitute for Heini Vatnsdal in the 82nd minute of a 1‚Äì0 win home win against Esbjerg fB. =Br√∏ndby= After returning to Br√∏ndby from his loan spell, Kabongo saw playing time in the team's pre-season friendlies, being in the starting lineup in a match against Shakhtar Donetsk. Kabongo made his official debut for Br√∏ndby in the first match of the 2018‚Äì19 Danish Superliga season, starting in a 2‚Äì0 away win over Randers FC and playing the entire match. On 16 August 2018, Kabongo made his UEFA Europa League debut, starting in a 2-1 home win over Spartak Subotica. His debut was short-lived, however, as he was sent off in the 15th minute for a professional foul on Dejan ƒêeniƒá. On 26 August 2018, in a 2-1 win over Vendsyssel FF, Kabongo was sent off again, this time for a 92nd minute foul on Sander Fischer, resulting in a penalty and Kabongo being shown a second yellow card. On 22 April 2019, in a match against FC Midtjylland, Kabongo suffered a cruciate ligament tear and was substituted in the first half. The initial prognosis suggested that he would miss 12 months. On 5 March 2020, Kabongo, alongside several other Br√∏ndby personnel, was placed in home quarantine after having met with former Br√∏ndby-player Thomas Kahlenberg, who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark. Kahlenberg had been infected at a birthday party in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Kabongo made his comeback in football on 21 May 2020 in a friendly against Lyngby.

Currently, only first-time voters are required to produce ID when voting in elections. A law passed in 2012 by the Pennsylvania State Legislature required all voters to produce ID. This law was overturned in 2014 in the Commonwealth Court on constitutional grounds. Current Pennsylvania voter laws If a citizen consistently votes in Pennsylvania, they do not need to re-register before the next election except to update information such as address, name, party if anything has changed. In order to become a registered voter in Pennsylvania, one must obtain US citizenship at least one month prior to the election date, be at least 18 years old by the next election date, and live in the district they will be voting in for at least 30 days prior to the election date. Those in prison for a felony are not permitted to vote, but one can vote if they are on parole or probation. To be eligible to vote, one must complete registration a minimum of 30 days prior to the election. Currently in Pennsylvania, no identification is required if it is not one's first time voting, and they should not be asked to provide any form of identification. If it is one's first time voting, or voting in a particular district, they will be required to show some form of identification. Acceptable forms of identification include: driver's license; US passport; military, student, or employee ID; voter registration card; firearm permit; current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck or government check; any other form of identification issued by the commonwealth or federal government. Although no documents are required to vote in Pennsylvania, voters are asked to provide their signature to verify with a signature kept on file. 2012 Voter ID law On March 14, 2012, Republican Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett signed a Voter ID bill into law, after it had been passed by the Pennsylvania State Legislature. The Voter ID law would require everyone who sought to vote to have specified types of photo identification before they could vote. The bill was pushed for and passed by Republican legislators who claimed that the bill was imperative to preventing voter fraud. In 2012, the Voter ID law was one of the most prohibitive in the entire country. Critics of the law claimed that this would prevent groups such as the older population and minorities from voting as they would be less likely to possess or be able to obtain the kinds of identifications specified by the law. This was substantiated in 2014 when a 2012 video of then Majority Leader Mike Turzai was leaked. In the recording, he described the passage of the Voter ID law as a successful plan to help Mitt Romney's chances of winning Pennsylvania in the 2012 presidential election. Critics also cited data from the Commonwealth that showed they had no evidence to corroborate the claim that voter fraud was a large issue as they had zero cases of a casting of a fraudulent vote on record. = Constitutional challenge = When the Voter ID bill was taken to court in 2012, it was initially upheld by Commonwealth Judge Robert Simpson. Judge Simpson did say that Mike Turzai's comments about the law concerned him, but despite his concern, he decided to uphold the law because regardless of what burdens it placed on people, the verbiage of the law and its implementation applied its stipulations to everybody in the state. He also argued that although he did see how it could impose upon the liberty of the voters, he felt that the actual purpose of the law was fair and outweighed the costs of its implementation. The decision was then appealed to the Supreme Court, but sent back to Simpson who then issued a decision saying that the law would not be implemented for the 2012 election. The Voter ID law while technically in effect was not enforced at polling places in 2012. A group of civil rights and legal organizations banded together to contest the law in court. Their goal was to have the law struck down by the 2012 presidential elections, as they felt the law was more about Republican advantage than preventing voter fraud; however, the case was not decided until 2014. The official lawsuit was Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The group of rights organizations represented 10 plaintiffs, all of which would be prevented from voting in the 2012 presidential election if the Voter ID law would be allowed to remain in place. Vic Walczak, a representative from the Pennsylvania ACLU, argued on behalf of these plaintiffs and pointed out that people who will not be able to produce the necessary forms of identification mostly fit into two categories: annual income of less than $20,000 and not possessing a GED. Hispanics and women were also populations with large amounts facing difficulty with obtaining these proper forms of identification. The case was heard by Honorable Bernard L. McGinley. McGinley declared the law to be unconstitutional, and that it placed unfair pressure on the rights of the citizen to vote and participate in elections as it required such specific forms of identification to cast a ballot, types of IDs that were not necessarily feasible for everyone to obtain or were equally accessible. He ruled that the law could not be put into action. In his opinion, he alluded to the fact that although the law did not specifically target people through its language, it would disenfranchise certain groups and people who had more trouble obtaining the necessary identification required under the law. McGinley also said in his decision that the state's argument that photo identification was necessary to prove people's identities and protect the elections did not clearly show a link between photo IDs and safer, better elections. =Fallout= The decision in Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania against the Voter ID law led to similar challenges to voter ID laws in Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Texas. Although the 2012 Voter ID law in Pennsylvania had been struck down in 2014, people were still experiencing problems with being asked for identification beyond their voter card when they went to the polls for the 2016 presidential election. There were several reports from people across the state that they had been asked for some form of identification that was not required under law.

Early life She was born and brought up at Mondeville in the Calvados region; her mother was from Normandy and her father was Italian. Wartime activities Aged 18 when the Germans occupied France in 1940, Guillemot worked as a shorthand typist. She became politically active and was a Communist sympathiser. By spring 1941 she was in charge of the \\"Front patriotique de la jeunesse\\" in Calvados. She joined the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans, and was involved in sabotaging German trains during 1942 and 1943. On 9 April 1943 she was arrested, along with other members of her network. After a trial beginning in June, she was condemned to death on 13 July 1943, along with fourteen men and one other woman, a teacher named Edmone Robert. All their male counterparts were shot, but Guillemot and Robert had their sentences commuted to imprisonment. After a stay at Fresnes Prison, where Guillemot wrote poems in a notebook that she managed to smuggle past the authorities, they were deported to prisons at L√ºbeck and Cottbus, and finally, under the \\"Nacht und Nebel\\" directive, to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, where they arrived in the autumn of 1944.

The locomotive was instead used from 1886 to 1894 by Mander & Bradley in Pukekaroro. Smyth Brothers tendered subsequently successfully for the locomotive and used it from 1897 to 1908 at Kennedy Bay, before it was sold in 1908 to the governmental Public Works Department as PWD # 511 for railway construction at Picton and Otira, and finally scrapped in 1917.

In 1904, Smyth Bros. found gold in one of their driving streams, Omoho Creek, exposed by the action of the floating kauri logs about 4 miles north of the Royal Oak Mine. By driving timber down the Omoho Creek towards Kennedy Bay the creek channel had been scoured clean, thus revealing many fine reefs and leaders. The leader discovered crossed the creek in north- southerly direction.

Signs and symptoms There are two forms of the disease - a lethal neonatal form and a chronic form. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is diagnosed at birth in half. Death in the first year is usually due to cardiac failure. Marked lactic acidemia occurs with even limited muscular exertion. The chronic form have stable cardiomyopathy and myopathy with a normal intellect. Other reported features include nystagmus, strabismus, hypotonia, hyporeflexia and delayed motor development. Genetics This disease is caused by mutations in AGK or SLC25A4 genes. The AGK gene encodes the mitochondrial acylglycerol kinase which plays a role in the assembly of adenine nucleotide translocator. The SLC25A4 gene encodes the heart and muscle specific isoform 1 of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator. Diagnosis The diagnosis may be provisionally made on clinical grounds. Further diagnostic tests include serum and urine analysis for lactic acid, a chest X-ray (or cardiac CT or MRI) and echocardiography. Biopsies from cardiac and skeletal muscle will show the presence of lipid and glycogen. testing for mitochondrial abnormalities, ANT deficiency and decreases of respiratory chain complexes I and IV can also be done. =Differential diagnosis= * Isolated ATP synthase deficiency * Barth syndrome * TMEM70 deficiency Treatment Surgery for the cataracts may be needed. Medical treatment for the cardiac failure will be required. Treatment is otherwise supportive. Prognosis About half the patients die within the first year of life. Because of its rarity the prognosis for the chronic form is not well established but survival into adulthood has been reported. Epidemiology Sengers syndrome is a rare disorder.

Primakov Readings 2017 were completed by the speech of the Chairman of the Board of the Center for Strategic Research Alexey Kudrin. = Primakov Readings 2018 = The main topic of Primakov Readings in 2018 was \\"Hedging Risks of Unstable World Order\\". The forum participants focused on scenarios of transformation of the international relations system, prospects for the development of the new world order and its stabilization, as well as on the most important challenges and risks of regional and global security. Program The Readings were attended by 65 prominent foreign experts from 22 countries and more than 600 representatives of the Russian scientific and expert community, public authorities, political and business circles, as well as by more than 200 media representatives. The Readings raised wide public resonance both in Russia and abroad: 38 interviews were conducted, with coverage of more than 30 million followers, and in the first week after the event, there were 1,668 reports about \\"Primakov Readings\\" in the mass media. A.A. Dynkin at the Primakov Readings 2018 At the opening ceremony prominent personalities such as Aide to the President of the Russian Federation Y.V. Ushakov, Chairman of the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation V.I. Matvienko, member of the Council of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Head of the LDPR faction V.V. Zhirinovsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the World Trade Center, President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation S.N. Katyrin and President of IMEMO A.A. Dynkin, made appeals to the participants of the conference. President of the Russian Federation V.V. Putin sent a greeting to the organizers and participants of the International Scientific and Expert Forum, expressing appreciation to the \\"Primakov Readings\\". The first session \\"New Bipolarity‚Äù ‚Äì Myth or Reality?‚Äù The first session - \\"New Bipolarity‚Äù ‚Äì Myth or Reality?‚Äù ‚Äì touched upon the problems of crisis of supranational and international institutions, as well as the appropriateness of the very concept of \\"bipolarity\\" in contemporary international relations. The expert from Austria said that Russia and China are moving towards establishing a new world order; however, it is too early to talk about the formation of a \\"new bipolarity\\". The expert from the United States disagreed, stressing that \\"competing bipolarity\\" is developing in the world, which will lead to a \\"new multipolarity\\". The representative from the PRC noted that China is in isolation, which Russia helps to overcome to some extent. In his opinion, the role of the new institutions, in the formation of which China is involved, is important, and that is whyChina‚Äôs tactics might be somehow offensive. The representative of China did not rule out the possibility of conflicts between Washington and Beijing. From the Chinese point of view, the new bipolarity is unacceptable and it is preferable to strive for the formation of blocks. According to the Indian expert, the state of world politics can be defined as \\"multiple multipolarity\\". The Russian participant of the session, in his turn, drew attention to the fact that the forming system is not only a polycentric and hierarchical, but also unstable: on the one hand, there is a growing interdependence, on the other ‚Äì increasing competitiveness. This trend shows the inconsistency of the dual logic of bipolarity and encourages the need to develop a new language of diplomacy. The second session, called \\"Infrastructure Rivalry in the Indo-Pacific Region: on Land and at Sea\\", raised questions related to the fierce competition for world trade routes, ports, and natural resources in the Indo-Pacific region. In addition the presence of a number of nuclear and threshold states in the region was mentioned during the discussion. –ês well as the complexity of the existence of \\"small\\" states, forced to maneuver between the political and economic interests of bigger players. The Vietnamese side raised the issue of political trust. The representative from India emphasized the need for economic infusions in the region's infrastructural projects, and especially the problem of competition among those projects. The expert from China stressed that Beijing's infrastructural projects are not imperialistic. He also criticized the idea of the Indian and Pacific oceans‚Äô connection. The US side highlighted the main obstacles to cooperation in the region: the lack of security framework between the US and China, coupled with a clash of values on which the US and Chinese foreign policy doctrines are based, the prevalence of bilateral infrastructural projects in the region and the difficulty of harmonizing interests in multilateral projects, as well as the problem of territorial issues in the South China Sea. According to the participants, one of the key and most problematic tasks is to find common grounds and to establish an institutional framework for the trade regime in the region under the conditions of a clash of interests of key players. The representative of Japan paid attention to the North Korean issue and noted that if Trump and Kim Jong-un reached an agreement, Russia and Japan could play a crucial role in the fundamental changes in the region. According to the Russian expert, a new format, combining bilateral and multilateral cooperation with an unlimited number of participants, would be the most promising scenario. From the point of view of Russian interests, according to the speaker, Chinese Belt and Road Initiative is the most perspective and realistic. Depending on what kind of the development of interaction formats prevails, the situation will lead either to an aggravation of competition or to the development of cooperation. The third session \\"New ‚ÄòGreat Game‚Äô in the Middle East\\" The third session, \\"New ‚ÄòGreat Game‚Äô in the Middle East\\", highlighted the following issues: increasing number of actors in the region (both state and non-state), abandonment of the \\"bipolar\\" logic concerning the division of spheres of influence in the economy, development of terrorism as a form of business, non- proliferation of nuclear weapons, and politicization of religion. According to the expert from Uzbekistan, there are several insurmountable factors hampering the achievement of stability in the Middle East: a crisis of confidence, a paralysis of the institutions of international security, an attempt by different actors to impose their own rules of the game in the conditions of chaos. Import of alien models and values leads to opposition from the local population and its turn towards Islamic fundamentalism. Political will of the United States and Russia is capable of bringing stability to the region and there are several points of convergence, such as common interests in the fight against extremism, as well as counteraction to radicalization of youth. The representative of India shared this view, stating that it is necessary to work out joint approaches to fighting hotbeds of tension in the region in those areas, where interests of major actors do not conflict. The US side also stressed the presence of numerous actors and the complexity of relationships between them, especially mentioning Russia's ability to find common ground between irreconcilable antagonists. The expert predicted gradual withdrawal of the US from the region. The representative from Israel noted that the weakening of state and its subjectivity occurred in the region, which has been related to dynamics of the \\"Arab Spring\\". In a number of cases, authoritarian regimes were reinforced. The weakening of the state created a vacuum, which brought an opportunity for various regional forces to intervene in conflicts. Russian participant in the session questioned the existence of the ¬´Great Game¬ª in the Middle East. In his opinion, there is no opposition between two \\"superpowers\\", but there are three levels of conflict: local, regional and global. A distinguished feature of Russia's foreign policy ‚Äì an attempt to build mutually beneficial relations with different parties, while Moscow does not try to oust anybody from the region. However, the US has recently become the main producer of hydrocarbons and pursuing new interests. S.V. Lavrov at the Primakov Readings 2018 During the discussion of the fourth session - \\"Exit Strategy for the Ukraine Crisis\\", most participants agreed with the non- alternative nature of the Minsk agreements, as well as with Moscow's declared need to overcome alienation that is artificially fueled in relations between Russia and Ukraine. Representatives of the US and EU at the session noted the need to consider the Ukrainian crisis in context of changes in the post-Soviet space and the determination to fit it into the architecture of European security. Both Russian and Western experts agreed on the need for a peacekeeping operation, primarily with a view to ending violence in the region. The second day of Primakov Readings was opened by speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, S.V. Lavrov, who touched upon the aggravation of international contradictions and the narrowing of space for constructive cooperation between countries, and consequently the risks of uncontrolled escalation. The fifth session - \\" Is there a Future for Arms Control? \\" - expanded traditional understanding of the subject, highlighting also the challenges of cyberspace and the emergence of hypersonic and smart weapons, touching on the philosophical question of whether there could be a regime of arms control in a multipolar world in general. The American expert confirmed that Russian issue is being used today in the US domestic politics. Representatives of the Russian side noted, that the nuclear arms race in the 21st century will no longer be a bilateral but multilateral. They also pointed out that a new arms control system cannot be built if the previously created mechanisms are destroyed. The representative from the European Union said that the control system no longer corresponds to the new realities, since it is a product of the bipolar world, and the question is how to organize a multilateral arms control negotiation process in a multipolar uncontrolled system. The expert stressed the need to counteract the US in its desire to extend legal norms of its national legislation to other countries. Indian expert called for a focus on reducing the risks of using nuclear weapons. The sixth session - \\" Russia and the EU ‚Äì Interdependence or Confrontation \\" ‚Äì revealed the unfavorable aspects of the deteriorating relations of partner countries, noted by all experts. The representative from France said that the international system will depend, first of all, on relations between the US and China. He noted the possibility of increasing confrontation in cyberspace, in the economy (related to the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative), if Russia continues its course toward strategic loneliness. The Italian expert pointed out the interdependence in relations between Russia and the EU, describing it as \\"hybrid cooperation\\". The participant noted the special complexity of the Ukrainian issue, as well as of the Serbian and Balkan problems. Representatives of the Russian point of view made in their speech an emphasis on the fall of investment activity between the Russian Federation and the EU. Experts noted an unprecedented crisis of confidence and, in connection with this, Russia's pivot to the East. Nevertheless, they also expressed hope for a more pragmatic approach of European business circles, which will allow separating economic benefits from political processes. The US representative at the session stated that Russia consciously chooses the path of the \\"rogue state\\": the country does not want to play by international rules and refuses to take responsibility for certain events. The seventh session - \\" Society changing Tech: Its Expanses and Limits\\" - conducted by A.A. Fursenko, the Aide to the President of the Russian Federation, highlighted the role of the state and the market in modern developed societies. Panel discussion touched upon the problems of: resource catastrophe, communication gap, growing interdependence of countries in the field of modern technologies, and state guarantees to cover risks of developing field-specific technologies. The specialists discussed possibilities of \\"blockchain\\" as a possible solution for a number of technological challenges. They agreed on the need to educate specialists aiming at invention and creative thinking, within the framework of solving special tasks for applied purposes. The Minister of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation M.M. Kotyukov, stressed that scientific community, business circles and system of education ‚Äì all participate in the technological development of the country. The Academy of Sciences once took upon itself the role of a major acquirer of R&D.; Today the role of the state in the sphere is paramount. The speaker pointed up that in international cooperation, the emphasis should be made both on the development of infrastructure and on the development of those competencies that are necessary for Russia to enter the market of leading projects. A.L. Kudrin and A.A. Dynkin at the Primakov Readings 2018 The American expert noted that under the conditions of \\"new normality\\" technologies can help to overcome a number of resource constraints. At the same time, technologies are developing at such a speed that governments often do not understand the whole picture, so the task of the academic community is to develop a set of rules and regulations in the field of technology. At the Special Session - \\"The Future of the Russian Economy\\", the Chairman of the Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation, A.L. Kudrin gave a speech. He touched upon the problems of implementing presidential decrees, forecasted the trends of development of the Russian economy, the demographic situation in the country, the investment market, the development of education and health care system, digitalization and weakening of the regulatory burden on business, as well as public administration reform. = Primakov Readings 2019 = The fifth annual round of the Primakov Readings was held in the year of Primakov‚Äôs 90th anniversary. The name of this meeting is ¬´Confrontation Revisited: Any Alternatives?¬ª. 80 leading experts from 29 countries and more than 600 representatives of Russian think tanks and universities, public authorities, political and business circles has taken part in the Primakov Readings in 2019. Program  Interesting facts  A. Kudrin and A. Dynkin at the Primakov Readings 2017 In the 2017 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report published by the University of Pennsylvania, Primakov Readings were given the 7th place in the list of 10 best conferences in the world. = Quotes from the Readings = * V. Putin: \\"Primakov has always been confident that Russia needs normal, constructive, good relations with Western countries. To the question \\"Is it possible to be friends with all in our world?\\" He replied: \\"It is impossible, but it is possible and necessary to work with them. The world is very complicated\\" * Lee Jae-Yong: \\"Since the beginning of the 21st century Russia has actively pushed forward its Eastern policy based on the growing global political and economic status of the Eurasia continent. Russia has aimed to build an economic bridge connecting Europe and Asia Pacific by promoting cooperation with countries in the Asia Pacific region\\". * W. Ishinger \\"We live in a moment that symbolizes, that represents the end of the post-Cold-War period and we are obviously moving into a more chaotic, more polycentic world which is going to be far more difficult to run, to operate, to keep stable than was the case previously\\". * R. Sakwa: \\"In my view, the international system is becoming, I would argue, far healthier by the emergence of these counter-hegemonic alliances; not anti- Western, but simply non-Western, and a different vision of the international system. Rather than talking about the chaos and so on, I‚Äôd rather say that I think the world has become more balances and, perhaps, will actually achieve, if this counter-hegemonic system can influence international society and temper the ambitions of the hegemonic system, a far more stable and enduring peaceful order\\". * Y. Ushakov and A. Dynkin at the Primakov Readings 2017A. Dynkin: \\"A polycentric world is much more complicated than a bipolar or unipolar construct in world architecture. We now see a multi-dimensional network, a fabric of international relations; at this point, of course, the role of analytical centers and professional expert organizations in undoubtedly increasing\\". * H. Kissinger: \\"Tensions between the United States and Russia are not a rare event, they have happened before and they have been overcome often before. Problems between the United States and Russia are needed to be solved by negotiation and by a common vision of the two\\". * G. Aragona: \\"Let‚Äôs not delude ourselves. The disappearance of the territorial base of Daish is not going to eliminate this form of threat. It will morph into other forms, and could even lead to an export of activities because if they cannot operate in the region, they might try to operate outside, in different ways. But unless we handle the political, social, economic, religious ‚Äì whatever, there are several reasons ‚Äì until we tackle these root causes, I am afraid that we shall make progress, but will not solve the problem\\".  Partners  Primakov Readings 2017 In 2016, the event was supported by the Russian Science Foundation in partnership with The Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program of the University of Pennsylvania. In 2017 IMEMO organized the Primakov Readings with the assistance of the Russian Science Foundation, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation, the Center for International Trade and the Center for Foreign Policy Cooperation named after E.M. Primakov. International partners of IMEMO were the Observer Research Foundation (India) and The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (USA).

Elthusa californica (E. californica) is a Sketch of a female adult E. californica. saltwater parasitic isopod. Like many species of the Elthusa genus, E. californica was first placed in within the Liveneca genus but later underwent taxonomic revisions.  Anatomy and morphology  The body of the Elthusa californica is oblong/oval shaped, typical of the vaulted body shape expected from the Elthusa genus. On average, the body length is around 16 mm long while the body width is around 7 mm wide. In general, the body length is slightly more than twice its body width. Due to the slightly shorter body length on the right side of the E. californica, the body is slightly twisted. a) Adult female E. californica. b) Lateral view of thoran The head of the E. californica is approximately 2 mm wide. It is triangular and has a strong and blunt outline on the anterior end. The cephalon posterior margin is not trilobed, once again typical characteristic of organisms found under the Elthusa genus. Two large, oval eyes sit on the post-lateral angles on the head. The eyes are approximately apart by the width of one-eye, making them rather close-set. On the head, two pairs of antennae may be found. Each pair of antennae is made up of eight or nine articles. The antennule is the shorter pair compared to the longer antenna and is shorter than all the pleopod lamellae. The antennule is slender and weak and extends to the seventh article on the other larger pair. E. californica has maxillipeds composed of two articles while the mandible has palps made up by three articles. The thorax is that of a typical Elthusa genus organism. It is made up of eight segments where the first segment with the head embedded into it, is the largest to an approximate size of 2mm in length. Both second and third segments are equal in length of approximately 1.5 mm. The fourth, fifth, and sixth segments are all 1 mm in length. The seventh segment is then the shortest one with a length of 0.5 mm. Narrow plates called epimera are separated along the last segments on the thorax. In the last segments, the epimera is capable of fully extend across the segment. The terminal thorax is at the posterior and it is about 4mm wide and 3.5 mm long. a) Maxilliped. b) Second maxilla. c) First maxilla. d) Palp of mandible. E. californica has legs that are capable of grasping objects. The legs also have long and slender dactyli. In adult females, the pleotelson is as wide as its length, which fits the typical description of the Elthusa genus. In juveniles, the color pigment granules are concentrated in the melanophores, thus, giving its lack of distinct pattern appearance.  Distribution, habitat, and behaviour  Elthusa californica may be typically found on the shores of California, near San Francisco, hence its species name. They are also distributed along the Pacific coast from Canada to Peru. E. californica is an ectoparasite and has been found on many reported host species. These include the actinopterygian fishes Cymatogaster aggregate and Atherinops affinis, Artedius lateralis, Clinocottus analis, Oligocottus maculosus, S. marmoratus, and Fundulus parvipinnis. Once they find a suitable host, they attach inside the opercular cavity of the gill chamber, making a protruding shape. Seventh leg of the E. californica Inside the gill chamber, E. californica feeds on the blood and tissue of the host fish. To ensure secure attachment to the host, the isopod uses seven pairs of sharply hooked legs and its specialized mouthpart. Due to the loss of blood for the host fish, the parasitic behavior of E. californica is hypothesized to influence the host growth process. Studies have shown that the presence of E. californica in host fish may subject them to lower levels of vitality when encountering a decrease in the seawater salinity. However, the general understanding is that E. californica is relatively harmless for the host fish as its activity is not fatal. They have an ecological preference as they like to select hosts that live in the benthic or that belong to a demersal school. Due to its smaller body size and less complex body structure compared to endoparasites, they are regarded as good indicators for environmental change such as those caused by pollution or climate. Lastly, studies have indicated that E. californica is capable of cross-fertilizing and hybridizing with other species of the same genus such as the Elthusa vulgaris.

He has been in exile from Syria since 2011 because of his refusal to join the Syrian military and could face arrest if returned there. Since November 2018, he currently resides in British Columbia, Canada. His plight has been compared to Tom Hanks's character in the film The Terminal, who was inspired by the real-life story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri who lived in France's Charles de Gaulle Airport for 18 years. According to CNN's Becky Anderson, his situation is not \\"unprecedented\\" and could become a more common problem for Syrian refugees because many countries will not accept Syrian nationals. Background Al Kontar was born in Al- Suweida, Syria to a Druze family. He has two siblings; his father was a mechanical engineer and his mother, a nurse. He originally emigrated from Syria to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2006, to work as an insurance marketing agent. His work permit expired in 2011, the year the Syrian Civil War started. After the Syrian embassy refused to renew his passport, Al Kontar stayed illegally in the UAE fearing he would be drafted into the war on his return. In 2017, he was arrested and deported to Malaysia, one of the countries where Syrians are granted visa-free entry. He attempted to go to Ecuador but, for unexplained reasons, Turkish Airlines staff denied him boarding for his flight nor would they refund his ticket. He then attempted to go to Cambodia but was denied entry, and sent back to Kuala Lumpur. As his Malaysian tourist visa had expired, he was not allowed to enter the country and remained stranded at the airport in \\"legal limbo\\". Malaysia is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and he claimed that he would not be recognized as a legitimate refugee although there are in fact many Syrian refugees in the country. =Life at the airport= Kuala Lumpur International Airport Al Kontar slept on chairs or under a stairwell, showered in a disabled toilet and was fed by some airport staff (mostly from AirAsia) who gave him meals. Though his savings dwindled, people offered him money and a woman living in British Columbia started a fundraiser in order to possibly sponsor him to Canada and have enough money to live for at least a year. He has family members in Canada. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has been trying to provide legal aid. During his 100th day at the airport in June 2018, he jokingly decided to apply to join a NASA mission to Mars, saying that if he actually had the opportunity to leave Earth and the worst parts of humanity, he would. On 1 October 2018, he was detained by the police for being in a \\"forbidden area\\" of the airport. Malaysia's immigration chief, Mustafar Ali, said they would \\"communicate with the Syrian embassy to facilitate deportation to his home country.\\" However, Mustafar Ali announced that Al Kontar would be sent to an undisclosed third country as the discussion and arrangement is being processed together with the foreign mission in Malaysia. Al Kontar was held in a detention facility for 58 days before the Canadian asylum application was expedited for him. Nas Daily made a video about Al Kontar but can't see him. So, he let his friend Agon Hare to go to Kuala Lumpur to see and make the video for people to support Al Kontar. =Asylum and life in Canada= On 26 November 2018, Al Kontar landed at Vancouver International Airport as a permanent resident of Canada and is expected to start a job in Whistler, British Columbia. Al Kontar had been privately sponsored for asylum in Canada; he lives with the family of one of his sponsors, media relations consultant Laurie Cooper. Cooper has helped over 30 refugees settle in Canada. Al Kontar currently speaks at events about human rights and works at a restaurant. Since August 2019, Al Kontar is currently organizing a refugee resettlement program called Operation Not Forgotten, sponsored by the Refugee Council of Australia and Amnesty International, which they plan to raise a total of C$3.3 million to resettle refugees stranded in Nauru and Manus Island into Canada. These refugees are from countries including Iran, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Iraq, while some are stateless.

Majesty Music is a privately-owned, conservative evangelical Christian music and book publishing company in Greenville, South Carolina, perhaps best known for its children's adventure- story character Patch the Pirate. The company publishes sheet music, hymnals, choral collections, cantatas and Christmas plays, audio recordings, and feature-length cartoons. History Majesty Music (originally Musical Ministries) was founded in 1973 by Frank Garlock (b. 1930), a musician with academic training from both Bob Jones University (BJU) and the Eastman School of Music. While teaching music theory at BJU, Garlock began a second career of \\"challenging the rock culture,\\" denouncing contemporary music for promoting \\"rebellion\\" and \\"the violation of moral principles.\\" Garlock feared that contemporary music styles were permeating evangelical churches as well as the larger society.Frank Garlock, I Being in the Way, the Lord Led Me: The Autobiography of Frank Watson Garlock (Greenville, SC: Majesty Music, 2012), 97, 121; Garlock, The Big Beat: A Rock Blast (Greenville, SC: Bob Jones University Press, 1971). The corporate name was changed from Musical Ministries to Majesty Music in 1988. Leaving the BJU faculty, he continued to conduct choral seminars to emphasize alternatives to contemporary music and (with the help of a wealthy friend) published, through his company, religious music written by himself, his daughter Shelly, and her husband Ron Hamilton (b. 1950). After losing an eye to cancer, Hamilton created the character \\"Patch the Pirate,\\" around which he based an album of children's songs, Sing Along with Patch the Pirate (1981). By 2018, Majesty Music had released 39 Patch the Pirate albums, sold more than a million recordings, and produced more than 800 of Hamilton's songs.Garlock, Autobiography,109-114; Mike Ellis, \\"'God chose to spare his life:' How Ron Hamilton became music legend Patch the Pirate,\\" Anderson Independent Mail, December 21, 2017. A few fundamentalists have criticized later Patch the Pirate albums for their \\"accented notes of the contemporary style,\\" \\"country western sound,\\" and \\"soft, sensual, 'middle-of- the-road,' 'easy listening' type of music.\\" H. T. Spence, Confronting Contemporary Christian Music (Dunn, North Carolina: Forwarding Faith Publications, 1997), 205-09. Shelly Hamilton describes the mechanics of producing the Patch the Pirate albums in \\"Ron Hamilton Interview and Testimony\\". In 1984, Majesty Music created Patch the Pirate clubs and published material for them that included Bible studies, devotional material, and elementary music theory lessons. Within ten years, more than 10,000 children were enrolled in the program.Garlock, Autobiography, 114. Majesty Music also supported an Adventures of Patch the Pirate radio broadcast, recognized by the National Religious Broadcasters as the country's third largest religious program for children, airing on more than 450 stations.Patch the Pirate website. Besides the Patch the Pirate material, Majesty Music has sold its own hymnals, sheet music, cantatas, and vocal and instrumental CDs and DVDs, some of them in Spanish.Majesty Music website. The company also continued to hold two-day music conferences.Majesty Music conferences webpage. At first operating from Frank Garlock's garage, Majesty Music expanded several times and eventually occupied two adjacent buildings on Wade Hampton Boulevard within walking distance of Bob Jones University.Garlock, Autobiography, 119-122. Most employees were BJU students or alumni. In 2018, the company repurposed its underused recording facility to accommodate a music studio, Majesty Music Academy.Majesty Music Academy website. During the late 1990s, the Garlocks began transferring ownership of the business to the Hamiltons; and in the 2010s, the Hamiltons made similar arrangements to perpetuate the ministry through their daughter, Megan, and her husband, Adam Morgan.Garlock, 122-23; Ellis.

Biography Gleason grew up around Wichita, Kansas. He was drawn to music at a young age. When he was in high school and early college he became increasingly interested in 1970s progressive rock music. In particular, he was an admirer of Kansas. He had performed in night clubs for years before he joined Kansas as a touring member. Despite being increasingly attracted by rock music, he did not choose a typical rock'n'roll lifestyle but he wanted to share a positive message, written from a Christian worldview. As Gleason stated in an interview in 1990, \\"I had the very good fortune of being raised in a home with two parents who were strong committed believers. So whether Jesus Christ was the truth or was real was never really a question. It was in my earliest upbringing. It was a natural part of me as a child. Of course, there came that moment of truth later on as an adolescent where I internalised that and made it my own. I'm committed to it, and have seen it borne out in the lives of people around me\\". =Early 1980s= Being an admirer of the music of Kansas and their main songwriter, Kerry Livgren, Gleason did some multi-track studio work that he sent to a post office box, which was on Livgren's first solo album, Seeds of Change from 1980. Several months later, Livgren called him back and asked him if he could join him on a new solo record. After vocalist Steve Walsh left Kansas in 1981, Gleason was among the hopefuls to become the new Kansas frontman, along with Warren Ham and others. Although John Elefante became new lead singer and keyboardist of Kansas, both Gleason and Ham left an impression on Livgren and were invited to join Kansas in the Drastic Measures tour in 1983 as touring members. Gleason played additional keyboards and added background vocals. =AD, 1983‚Äì1988= In 1983, Livgren recorded his second solo release along with himself on guitar and keyboard, Michael Gleason on vocals, keyboards and guitar, Warren Ham on saxophone, flute, harmonica and vocals, David Hope on bass, and Dennis Holt on drums. While Livgren and Hope had still been members of Kansas officially during the recording process, both left the band after a final New Year's Eve performance on December 31, 1983, which was at least partly a result of their new-found Christian beliefs that they felt unable to share in a free creative way due to rising tension with other band members and with the record label, Kirshner Records. During sessions for the album, it became apparent that the musicians shared many interests, not the least of which was their Christian faith. After years of feeling isolated and artistically stifled in Kansas, Livgren found working with fellow Christians refreshing. By the end of the recording sessions, the session musicians had jelled, and Livgren decided to name the group AD. Finally, their first album, Time Line, was released in 1984 and credited to Kerry Livgren/AD. However, it received virtually no promotion from CBS Records, who probably saw the side project as a threat to the continued success of Kansas. Due to legal entanglements caused by his contractual obligations with Kansas, Livgren was unable to market AD in the mainstream secular market. After negotiating with the record label, he received a waiver to perform with AD in the Christian rock market. This would become a hindrance to commercial viability for the band. AD released their second album Art of the State in 1985. AD toured extensively in 1984 and 1985, sometimes playing bars and clubs one night and then churches the next. In spite of favorable album reviews, the tour for Art of the State was not as successful as intended, resulting in Warren Ham's departure from the band in 1986. After Ham's departure, Gleason handled all lead vocals alone on AD's third album Reconstructions, which was released in 1986. Because of financial difficulties and the inability to keep up with the lack of support, AD faded away after its release, though no official breakup was announced. In 1988, Livgren released a collection of previously unreleased AD songs titled Prime Mover, which was credited once again to Kerry Livgren/AD. Livgren played most instruments, while lead vocals, saxophone and blues harp were performed by Warren Ham. Gleason wrote the song I'll Follow You for this album and performed background vocals on it. Sparrow Records also released an AD compilation including songs from Art of the State and Reconstructions in 1988 called Compact Favorites. In 1992, Sparrow released a Kerry Livgren/AD two-CD collection called Decade that featured the whole Time Line (AD) and Seeds of Change (Kerry Livgren) albums as well as songs from Art of the State (AD), Reconstructions (AD), Prime Mover (Kerry Livgren/AD) and One of Several Possible Musiks (Kerry Livgren). In addition, two previously unreleased songs from the Time Line sessions in 1983 with Michael Gleason on vocals were included. These two songs as well as another previously unreleased track, All in Time, which was originally recorded in 1986 and written and sung by Gleason, were included in the reissue Reconstructions Reconstructed, released by Livgren's Numavox record company in 1997 and again - remastered and repackaged - in 2006. In 1997, Livgren rediscovered recordings of two AD performances from 1984 and 1985, remastered them and released them as AD Live in 1998. =Solo artist and producer= In 1986, while he was still in AD, Michael Gleason recorded his first solo effort, called Voices from the Old World, an instrumental orchestral album. This album was later reissued on cd in 1998 by Numavox Records. In 1987, he formed Pressure Point Productions in Atlanta, Georgia. He then began song writing, session and production work for other artists, including Steven Curtis Chapman, Wes King, Newsboys, Michael Card, Steve Green, Geoff Moore & The Distance, and many others. He also released instrumental songs for various compilations, including Lifetimes for the 1987 album Jazz Flavors Cats IV. Gleason released his first rock solo album, Children of Choices, in 1990 through Pakaderm Records. The album featured an album-oriented rock sound, influenced by modern pop elements and was produced by himself as well as John and Dino Elefante. It enjoyed critical success, with two singles garnering top-five CCM chart positions. Gleason wrote the CCM-chart-topping Say the Word for Truth's 1998 album Never Be the Same, and the #1 CCM hit The Stranger performed by Aaron Jeoffrey. In 2001, he released his third solo project called Every Road, moving into a more mature rock/acoustic/singer-songwriter style. In 2005, his fourth solo album, Cornerstone, came out, which is in style similar to Every Road but with a stronger contemporary praise & worship direction. In addition, he wrote and performed songs for the Why Don't You: Songs That Teach Character (2002) and Why Don't You: Songs That Build Character (2005) children's music compilations as well as the song Throw Me a Line for the Letters to God Soundtrack (2010).

It was proposed by Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy in 2015. While the effect of batch normalization is evident, the reasons behind its effectiveness remain under discussion. It was believed that it can mitigate the problem of internal covariate shift, where parameter initialization and changes in the distribution of the inputs of each layer affect the learning rate of the network. Recently, some scholars have argued that batch normalization does not reduce internal covariate shift, but rather smooths the objective function, which in turn improves the performance. However, at initialization, batch normalization in fact induces severe gradient explosion in deep networks, which is only alleviated by skip connections in residual networks. Others sustain that batch normalization achieves length-direction decoupling, and thereby accelerates neural networks. After batch norm, many other in-layer normalization methods have been introduced, such as instance normalization, layer normalization, group normalization.  Motivation: The phenomenon of internal covariate shift  Each layer of a neural network has inputs with a corresponding distribution, which is affected during the training process by the randomness in the parameter initialization and the randomness in the input data. The effect of these sources of randomness on the distribution of the inputs to internal layers during training is described as internal covariate shift. Although a clear-cut precise definition seems to be missing, the phenomenon observed in experiments is the change on means and variances of the inputs to internal layers during training. Batch normalization was initially proposed to mitigate internal covariate shift. During the training stage of networks, as the parameters of the preceding layers change, the distribution of inputs to the current layer changes accordingly, such that the current layer needs to constantly readjust to new distributions. This problem is especially severe for deep networks, because small changes in shallower hidden layers will be amplified as they propagate within the network, resulting in significant shift in deeper hidden layers. Therefore, the method of batch normalization is proposed to reduce these unwanted shifts to speed up training and to produce more reliable models. Besides reducing internal covariate shift, batch normalization is believed to introduce many other benefits. With this additional operation, the network can use higher learning rate without vanishing or exploding gradients. Furthermore, batch normalization seems to have a regularizing effect such that the network improves its generalization properties, and it is thus unnecessary to use dropout to mitigate overfitting. It has been observed also that with batch norm the network becomes more robust to different initialization schemes and learning rates.  Procedures = Batch Normalizing Transform = In a neural network, batch normalization is achieved through a normalization step that fixes the means and variances of each layer's inputs. Ideally, the normalization would be conducted over the entire training set, but to use this step jointly with stochastic optimization methods, it is impractical to use the global information. Thus, normalization is restrained to each mini-batch in the training process. Use B to denote a mini-batch of size m of the entire training set. The empirical mean and variance of B could thus be denoted as \\\\mu_B = \\\\frac 1 m \\\\sum_{i=1}^m x_i, and \\\\sigma_B^2 = \\\\frac 1 m \\\\sum_{i=1}^m (x_i-\\\\mu_B)^2. For a layer of the network with d-dimensional input, x = (x^{(1)},...,x^{(d)}), each dimension of its input is then normalized (i.e. re-centered and re-scaled) separately, \\\\hat{x}_{i}^{(k)} = \\\\frac {x_i^{(k)}-\\\\mu_B^{(k)}} \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma_B^{(k)^2}+\\\\epsilon}, where k \\\\in [1,d] and i \\\\in [1,m]; \\\\mu_B^{(k)} and \\\\sigma_B^{(k)^2} are the per-dimension mean and variance, respectively. \\\\epsilon is added in the denominator for numerical stability and is an arbitrarily small constant. The resulting normalized activation \\\\hat{x}^{(k)}have zero mean and unit variance, if \\\\epsilon is not taken into account. To restore the representation power of the network, a transformation step then follows as y_i^{(k)} = \\\\gamma^{(k)} \\\\hat{x}_{i}^{(k)} +\\\\beta^{(k)}, where the parameters \\\\gamma^{(k)} and \\\\beta^{(k)} are subsequently learned in the optimization process. Formally, the operation that implements batch normalization is a transform BN_{\\\\gamma^{(k)},\\\\beta^{(k)}}: x^{(k)}_{1...m} \\\\rightarrow y^{(k)}_{1...m} called the Batch Normalizing transform. The output of the BN transform y^{(k)} = BN_{\\\\gamma^{(k)},\\\\beta^{(k)}}(x^{(k)}) is then passed to other network layers, while the normalized output \\\\hat{x}_{i}^{(k)} remains internal to the current layer. = Backpropagation = The described BN transform is a differentiable operation, and the gradient of the loss l with respect to the different parameters can be computed directly with chain rule. Specifically, \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial y_i^{(k)}} depends on the choice of activation function, and the gradient against other parameters could be expressed as a function of \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial y_i^{(k)}} : \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\hat{x}_i^{(k)}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial y_i^{(k)}}\\\\gamma^{(k)} , \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\gamma^{(k)}} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial y_i^{(k)}}\\\\hat{x}_i^{(k)} , \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\beta^{(k)}} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial y_i^{(k)}} , \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\sigma_B^{(k)^2}} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial y_i^{(k)}} (x_i^{(k)}-\\\\mu_B^{(k)})\\\\left(-\\\\frac {\\\\gamma^{(k)}} 2 (\\\\sigma_B^{(k)^2}+\\\\epsilon)^{-3/2}\\\\right) , \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\mu_B^{(k)}} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial y_i^{(k)}}\\\\frac{-\\\\gamma}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma_B^{(k)^2}+\\\\epsilon}}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\sigma_B^{(k)^2}}\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum_{i=1}^m (-2)\\\\cdot (x_i^{(k)}-\\\\mu^{(k)}_B) , and \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial x_i^{(k)}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\hat{x}^{(k)}_i}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma_B^{(k)^2}+\\\\epsilon}}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\sigma_B^{(k)^2}}\\\\frac{2(x_i^{(k)}-\\\\mu_B^{(k)})}{m}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\mu_B^{(k)}}\\\\frac{1}{m} . = Inference with Batch-Normalized Networks = During the training stage, the normalization steps depend on the mini-batches to ensure efficient and reliable training. However, in the inference stage, this dependence is not useful any more. Instead, the normalization step in this stage is computed with the population statistics such that the output could depend on the input in a deterministic manner. The population mean, E[x^{(k)}], and variance, \\\\operatorname{Var}[x^{(k)}], are computed as: E[x^{(k)}] = E_{B}[\\\\mu^{(k)}_B] , and \\\\operatorname{Var}[x^{(k)}] = \\\\frac{m}{m-1}E_{B}[\\\\sigma^{(k)^2}_B] . The population statistics thus is a complete representation of the mini-batches. The BN transform in the inference step thus becomes y^{(k)} = BN^{\\\\text{inf}}_{\\\\gamma^{(k)},\\\\beta^{(k)}}(x^{(k)})=\\\\frac{\\\\gamma^{(k)}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{Var}[x^{(k)}]+\\\\epsilon}}x^{(k)}+\\\\Bigg(\\\\beta^{(k)}-\\\\frac{\\\\gamma^{(k)} E[x^{(k)}]}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{Var}[x^{(k)}]+\\\\epsilon}}\\\\Bigg), where y^{(k)} is passed on to future layers instead of x^{(k)}. Since the parameters are fixed in this transformation, the batch normalization procedure is essentially applying a linear transform to the activation.  Understanding Batch Normalization  Although batch normalization has become a popular method due to its strengths, the working mechanism of the method is not yet well- understood. Scholars show that internal covariate shift is not reduced significantly by batch normalization, despite of common belief. Some scholars attribute the good performance to smoothing the objective function, while others propose that length-direction decoupling is the reason behind its effectiveness. = Batch Normalization and Internal Covariate Shift = The correlation between batch normalization and internal covariate shift is widely accepted but was not supported by experimental results. Scholars recently show with experiments that the hypothesized relationship is not an accurate one. Rather, the enhanced accuracy with the batch normalization layer seems to be independent of internal covariate shift.  Adding Covariate Shift to Batch Normalization Layers  To understand if there is any correlation between reducing covariate shift and improving performance, an experiment is performed to elucidate the relationship. Specifically, three models are trained and compared: a standard VGG network without batch normalization, a VGG network with batch normalization layers, and a VGG network with batch normalization layers and random noise. In the third model, the noise has non-zero mean and non-unit variance, and is generated at random for each layer. It is then added after the batch normalization layers to deliberately introduce covariate shift into activation. With these three models, two observations are made. First, the third, noisy model has less stable distributions at all layers compared with the other two models due to the extra noise layer. Despite of the noise, the training accuracy of the second and the third model are similar, and are both higher than that of the first model. While the internal covariate shifts are larger at all levels, the model with batch normalization still performs better than the standard VGG model. It could thus be concluded that internal covariate shift might not be the contributing factor of the performance of batch normalization.  Measuring Internal Covariate Shift with and without Batch Normalization Layers  Since it is hypothesized that batch normalization layers could reduce internal covariate shift, an experiment is set up to measure quantitatively how much covariate shift is reduced. First, the notion of internal covariate shift needs to be defined mathematically. Specifically, to quantify the adjustment that a layer's parameters make in response to updates in previous layers, the correlation between the gradients of the loss before and after all previous layers are updated is measured, since gradients could capture the shifts from the first-order training method. If the shift introduced by the changes in previous layers is small, then the correlation between the gradients would be close to 1. The correlation between the gradients are computed for four models: a standard VGG network, a VGG network with batch normalization layers, a 25-layer deep linear network (DLN) trained with full-batch gradient descent, and a DLN network with batch normalization layers. Interestingly, it is shown that the standard VGG and DLN models both have higher correlations of gradients compared with their counterparts, indicating that the additional batch normalization layers are not reducing internal covariate shift. = Smoothness of the Optimization Landscape = Some scholars proposed and proved that batch normalization could introduce greater Lipschitzness into the loss and the gradient during training, and that this improved smoothness could explain its great performance. These effects can be observed by comparing VGG networks trained with and without batch normalization, and is also consistent among other networks, such as linear deep networks. Specifically, it is observed that the loss changes less, and that the gradients of the loss have smaller magnitudes and are more Lipschitz. Moreover, the batch normalized models are compared with models with different normalization techniques. Specifically, these normalization methods work by first fixing the first order moment of activation, and then normalizing it by the average of the l_p norm. These methods thus have larger distributional shift, but smoother landscape. Evidently, these models yield similar performance as batch normalized models. This two-way relationship could thus indicate that smoothness of the optimization landscape could be a contributing factor to the superior performance of batch normalization. Besides analyzing this correlation experimentally, theoretical analysis is also provided for verification that batch normalization could result in a smoother landscape. Consider two identical networks, one contains batch normalization layers and the other doesn't, the behaviors of these two networks are then compared. Denote the loss functions as L and \\\\hat{L} , respectively. Let the input to both networks be x , and the output be y , for which y = Wx , where W is the layer weights. For the second network, y additionally goes through a batch normalization layer. Denote the normalized activation as \\\\hat{y} , which has zero mean and unit variance. Let the transformed activation be z = \\\\gamma\\\\hat{y}+\\\\beta , and suppose \\\\gamma and \\\\beta are constants. Finally, denote the standard deviation over a mini-batch \\\\hat{y_j} \\\\in \\\\R^m as \\\\sigma_j . First, it can be shown that the gradient magnitude of a batch normalized network, \\\\triangledown_{y_i}\\\\hat{L} , is bounded, with the bound expressed as \\\\triangledown_{y_i}\\\\hat{L}^2 \\\\le \\\\frac{\\\\gamma^2}{\\\\sigma_j^2}\\\\Bigg(\\\\triangledown_{y_i}L^2-\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\langle 1,\\\\triangledown_{y_i}L\\\\rangle^2-\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\langle\\\\triangledown_{y_i}L,\\\\hat{y}_j\\\\rangle^2\\\\bigg) . Since the gradient magnitude represents the Lipschitzness of the loss, this relationship indicates that a batch normalized network could achieve greater Lipschitzness comparatively. Notice that the bound gets tighter when the gradient \\\\triangledown_{y_i}\\\\hat{L} correlates with the activation \\\\hat{y_i} , which is a common phenomena. The scaling of \\\\frac{\\\\gamma^2}{\\\\sigma^2_j} is also significant, since the variance is often large. Secondly, the quadratic form of the loss Hessian with respect to activation in the gradient direction can be bounded as (\\\\triangledown_{y_j}\\\\hat{L})^T \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{L}}{\\\\partial y_j \\\\partial y_j}(\\\\triangledown_{y_j}\\\\hat{L}) \\\\le \\\\frac{\\\\gamma^2}{\\\\sigma^2} \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{L}}{\\\\partial y_j}\\\\bigg)^T \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial y_j \\\\partial y_j}\\\\bigg)\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{L}}{\\\\partial y_j}\\\\bigg) -\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{m\\\\sigma^2}\\\\langle\\\\triangledown_{y_j}L,\\\\hat{y_j}\\\\rangle \\\\bigg\\\\bigg\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{L}}{\\\\partial y_j}\\\\bigg\\\\bigg^2 . The scaling of \\\\frac{\\\\gamma^2}{\\\\sigma^2_j} indicates that the loss Hessian is resilient to the mini-batch variance, whereas the second term on the right hand side suggests that it becomes smoother when the Hessian and the inner product are non-negative. If the loss is locally convex, then the Hessian is positive semi-definite, while the inner product is positive if \\\\hat{g_j} is in the direction towards the minimum of the loss. It could thus be concluded from this inequality that the gradient generally becomes more predictive with the batch normalization layer. It then follows to translate the bounds related to the loss with respect to the normalized activation to a bound on the loss with respect to the network weights: \\\\hat{g_j} \\\\le \\\\frac{\\\\gamma^2}{\\\\sigma_j^2}(g^2_j-m\\\\mu^2_{g_j}-\\\\lambda^2\\\\langle \\\\triangledown_{y_j}L,\\\\hat{y}_j\\\\rangle^2) , where g_j = max_{X\\\\le\\\\lambda} \\\\triangledown_W L^2 and \\\\hat{g}_j = max_{X\\\\le\\\\lambda} \\\\triangledown_W \\\\hat{L}^2 . In addition to the smoother landscape, it is further shown that batch normalization could result in a better initialization with the following inequality: W_0-\\\\hat{W}^*^2 \\\\le W_0-W^*^2-\\\\frac{1}{W^*^2}(W^*^2-\\\\langle W^*,W_0\\\\rangle)^2 , where W^* and \\\\hat{W}^* are the local optimal weights for the two networks, respectively. Some scholars argue that the above analysis cannot fully capture the performance of batch normalization, because the proof only concerns the largest eigenvalue, or equivalently, one direction in the landscape at all points. It is suggested that the complete eigenspectrum needs to be taken into account to make a conclusive analysis. = Counterintuitive Roughness of the Optimization Landscape at Initialization = Even though batchnorm was originally introduced to alleviate gradient vanishing or explosion problems, a deep batchnorm network in fact suffers from gradient explosion at initialization time, no matter what it uses for nonlinearity. Thus the optimization landscape is very far from smooth for a randomly initialized, deep batchnorm network. More precisely, if the network has L layers, then the gradient of the first layer weights has norm > c\\\\lambda^L for some \\\\lambda>1, c>0 depending only on the nonlinearity. For any fixed nonlinearity, \\\\lambda decreases as the batch size increases. For example, for ReLU, \\\\lambda decreases to \\\\pi/(\\\\pi-1)\\\\approx 1.467 as the batch size tends to infinity. Practically, this means deep batchnorm networks are untrainable. This is only relieved by skip connections in the fashion of residual networks. This gradient explosion on the surface contradicts the smoothness property explained in the previous section, but in fact they are consistent. The previous section studies the effect of inserting a single batchnorm in a network, while the gradient explosion depends on stacking batchnorms typical of modern deep neural networks. = Length-Direction Decoupling = It is argued that the success of batch normalization could be at least partially credited to the length-direction decoupling effect that the method provides. By interpreting the batch normalization procedure as the reparametrization of weight space, it could be shown that the length and the direction of the weights are separated after the procedure, and they could thus be trained separately. For a particular neural network unit with input x and weight vector w , denote its output as f(w) = E_x[\\\\phi(x^Tw)] , where \\\\phi is the activation function, and denote S = E[xx^T] . Assume that E[x]=0 , and that the spectrum of the matrix S is bounded as 0<\\\\mu = \\\\lambda_{min}(S) , L=\\\\lambda_{max}(S)<\\\\infty , such that S is symmetric positive definite. Adding batch normalization to this unit thus results in f_{BN}(w,\\\\gamma,\\\\beta) = E_x[\\\\phi(BN(x^Tw))] = E_x\\\\bigg[\\\\phi\\\\bigg(\\\\gamma(\\\\frac{x^Tw- E_x[x^Tw]}{var_x[x^Tw]^{1/2}})+\\\\beta\\\\bigg)\\\\bigg] , by definition. The variance term can be simplified such that var_x[x^Tw]=w^TSw . Assume that x has zero mean and \\\\beta can be omitted, then it follows that f_{BN}(w,\\\\gamma) = E_x\\\\bigg[\\\\phi\\\\bigg(\\\\gamma\\\\frac{x^Tw}{(w^TSw)^{1/2}}\\\\bigg)\\\\bigg] , where (w^TSw)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} is the induced norm of S , w_s . Hence, it could be concluded that f_{BN}(w,\\\\gamma) = E_x[\\\\phi(x^T\\\\tilde{w})] , where \\\\tilde{w}=\\\\gamma \\\\frac{w}{w_s} , and \\\\gamma and w accounts for its length and direction separately. This property could then be used to prove the faster convergence of problems with batch normalization.  Linear Convergence of the Least-Square Problem with Batch Normalization  With the reparametrization interpretation, it could then be proved that applying batch normalization to the ordinary least squares problem achieves a linear convergence rate in gradient descent, which is faster than the regular gradient descent with only sub-linear convergence. Denote the objective of minimizing an ordinary least squares problem as min_{\\\\tilde{w}\\\\in R^d}f_{OLS}(\\\\tilde{w})=min_{\\\\tilde{w}\\\\in R^d}(E_{x,y}[(y-x^T\\\\tilde{w})^2])=min_{\\\\tilde{w}\\\\in R^d}(2u^T\\\\tilde{w}+\\\\tilde{w}^TS\\\\tilde{w}) , where u=E[-yx] . Since \\\\tilde{w}=\\\\gamma\\\\frac{w}{w_s} , the objective thus becomes min_{w\\\\in R^d\\\\backslash\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\},\\\\gamma\\\\in R}f_{OLS}(w,\\\\gamma)=min_{w\\\\in R^d\\\\backslash\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\},\\\\gamma\\\\in R}\\\\bigg(2\\\\gamma\\\\frac{u^Tw}{w_S+\\\\gamma^2}\\\\bigg) , where 0 is excluded to avoid 0 in the denominator. Since the objective is convex with respect to \\\\gamma , its optimal value could be calculated by setting the partial derivative of the objective against \\\\gamma to 0. The objective could be further simplified to be min_{w\\\\in R^d\\\\backslash\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}}\\\\rho(w)=min_{w\\\\in R^d\\\\backslash\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}}\\\\bigg(-\\\\frac{w^Tuu^Tw}{w^TSw}\\\\bigg) . Note that this objective is a form of the generalized Rayleigh quotient \\\\tilde{\\\\rho}(w)=\\\\frac{w^TBw}{w^TAw} , where B\\\\in R^{d \\\\times d} is a symmetric matrix and A\\\\in R^{d\\\\times d} is a symmetric positive definite matrix. It is proven that the gradient descent convergence rate of the generalized Rayleigh quotient is \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_1-\\\\rho(w_{t+1})}{\\\\rho(w_{t+1}-\\\\lambda_2)}\\\\le \\\\bigg(1-\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_2}{\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_{min}}\\\\bigg)^{2t}\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_1-\\\\rho(w_t)}{\\\\rho(w_t)-\\\\lambda_2} , where \\\\lambda_1 is the largest eigenvalue of B , \\\\lambda_2 is the second largest eigenvalue of B , and \\\\lambda_{min} is the smallest eigenvalue of B . In our case, B=uu^T is a rank one matrix, and the convergence result can be simplified accordingly. Specifically, consider gradient descent steps of the form w_{t+1}=w_t-\\\\eta_t\\\\triangledown\\\\rho(w_t) with step size \\\\eta_t=\\\\frac{w_t^TSw_t}{2L\\\\rho(w_t)} , and starting from \\\\rho(w_0) e 0 , then \\\\rho(w_t)-\\\\rho(w^*)\\\\le \\\\bigg(1-\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{L}\\\\bigg)^{2t}(\\\\rho(w_0)-\\\\rho(w^*)) .  Linear Convergence of the Learning Halfspace Problem with Batch Normalization  The problem of learning halfspaces refers to the training of the Perceptron, which is the simplest form of neural network. The optimization problem in this case is min_{\\\\tilde{w}\\\\in R^d}f_{LH}(\\\\tilde{w})=E_{y,x}[\\\\phi(z^T\\\\tilde{w})] , where z=-yx and \\\\phi is an arbitrary loss function. Suppose that \\\\phi is infinitely differentiable and has a bounded derivative. Assume that the objective function f_{LH} is \\\\zeta -smooth, and that a solution \\\\alpha^* = argmin_{\\\\alpha}\\\\triangledown f(\\\\alpha w)^2 exists and is bounded such that -\\\\infty < \\\\alpha^* < \\\\infty . Also assume z is a multivariate normal random variable. With the Gaussian assumption, it can be shown that all critical points lie on the same line, for any choice of loss function \\\\phi . Specifically, the gradient of f_{LH} could be represented as \\\\triangledown_{\\\\tilde{w}}f_{LH}(\\\\tilde{w})=c_1(\\\\tilde{w})u+c_2(\\\\tilde{w})S\\\\tilde{w} , where c_1(\\\\tilde{w})=E_z[\\\\phi^{(1)}(z^T\\\\tilde{w})]-E_z[\\\\phi^{(2)}(z^T\\\\tilde{w})](u^T\\\\tilde{w}) , c_2(\\\\tilde{w})=E_z[\\\\phi^{(2)}(z^T\\\\tilde{w})] , and \\\\phi^{(i)} is the i -th derivative of \\\\phi . By setting the gradient to 0, it thus follows that the bounded critical points \\\\tilde{w}_* can be expressed as \\\\tilde{w}_* = g_*S^{-1}u , where g_* depends on \\\\tilde{w}_* and \\\\phi . Combining this global property with length-direction decoupling, it could thus be proved that this optimization problem converges linearly. First, a variation of gradient descent with batch normalization, Gradient Descent in Normalized Paramterization (GDNP), is designed for the objective function min_{w\\\\in R^d\\\\backslash\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\},\\\\gamma\\\\in R}f_{LH}(w,\\\\gamma) , such that the direction and length of the weights are updated separately. Denote the stopping criterion of GDNP as h(w_t,\\\\gamma_t)=E_z[\\\\phi'(z^T\\\\tilde{w}_t)](u^Tw_t)-E_z[\\\\phi(z^T\\\\tilde{w}_t)](u^Tw_t)^2 . Let the step size be s_t=s(w_t,\\\\gamma_t)=-\\\\frac{w_t_S^3}{Lg_th(w_t,\\\\gamma_t)} . For each step, if h(w_t,\\\\gamma_t) e 0 , then update the direction as w_{t+1}=w_t- s_t\\\\triangledown_w f(w_t,\\\\gamma_t) . Then update the length according to \\\\gamma_t = Bisection(T_s,f,w_t) , where Bisection() is the classical bisection algorithm, and T_s is the total iterations ran in the bisection step. Denote the total number of iterations as T_d , then the final output of GDNP is \\\\tilde{w}_{T_d} = \\\\gamma_{T_d}\\\\frac{w_{T_d}}{w_{T_d}_S} . The GDNP algorithm thus slightly modifies the batch normalization step for the ease of mathematical analysis. It can be shown that in GDNP, the partial derivative of f_{LH} against the length component converges to zero at a linear rate, such that (\\\\partial_\\\\gamma f_{LH}(w_t,a_t^{(T_s)})^2\\\\le \\\\frac{2^{-T_s}\\\\zetab_t^{(0)}-a_t^{(0)}}{\\\\mu^2} , where a_t^{(0)} and b_t^{0} are the two starting points of the bisection algorithm on the left and on the right, correspondingly. Further, for each iteration, the norm of the gradient of f_{LH} with respect to w converges linearly, such that w_t_S^2\\\\triangledown f_{LH}(w_t,g_t)_{S^{-1}}^2\\\\le \\\\bigg(1-\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{L}\\\\bigg)^{2t}\\\\Phi^2\\\\gamma_t^2(\\\\rho(w_0)-\\\\rho^*) . Combining these two inequalities, a bound could thus be obtained for the gradient with respect to \\\\tilde{w}_{T_d} : \\\\triangledown_\\\\tilde{w}f(\\\\tilde{w}_{T_d})^2\\\\le \\\\bigg(1-\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{L}\\\\bigg)^{2T_d}\\\\Phi^2(\\\\rho(w_0)-\\\\rho^*)+\\\\frac{2^{-T_s}\\\\zetab_t^{(0)}-a_t^{(0)}}{\\\\mu^2} , such that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge linearly. Although the proof stands on the assumption of Gaussian input, it is also shown in experiments that GDNP could accelerate optimization without this constraint.  Linear Convergence of Neural Networks with Batch Normalization  Consider a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer and m hidden units with mapping from input x\\\\in R^d to a scalar output described as F_x(\\\\tilde{W},\\\\Theta)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\\\theta_i\\\\phi(x^T\\\\tilde{w}^{(i)}) , where \\\\tilde{w}^{(i)} and \\\\theta_i are the input and output weights of unit i correspondingly, and \\\\phi is the activation function and is assumed to be a tanh function. The input and output weights could then be optimized with min_{\\\\tilde{W},\\\\Theta}(f_{NN}(\\\\tilde{W},\\\\Theta)=E_{y,x}[l(-yF_x(\\\\tilde{W},\\\\Theta))]) , where l is a loss function, \\\\tilde{W}=\\\\\\\\{\\\\tilde{w}^{(1)},...,\\\\tilde{w}^{(m)}\\\\\\\\} , and \\\\Theta=\\\\\\\\{\\\\theta^{(1)},...,\\\\theta^{(m)}\\\\\\\\} . Consider fixed \\\\Theta and optimizing only \\\\tilde{W} , it can be shown that the critical points of f_{NN}(\\\\tilde{W}) of a particular hidden unit i , \\\\hat{w}^{(i)} , all align along one line depending on incoming information into the hidden layer, such that \\\\hat{w}^{(i)} = \\\\hat{c}^{(i)}S^{-1}u , where \\\\hat{c}^{(i)}\\\\in R is a scalar, i =1,...,m . This result could be proved by setting the gradient of f_{NN} to zero and solving the system of equations. Apply the GDNP algorithm to this optimization problem by alternating optimization over the different hidden units. Specifically, for each hidden unit, run GDNP to find the optimal W and \\\\gamma . With the same choice of stopping criterion and stepsize, it follows that \\\\triangledown_{\\\\tilde{w}^{(i)}}f(\\\\tilde{w}_t^{(i)})^2_{S^{-1}}\\\\le\\\\bigg(1-\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{L}\\\\bigg)^{2t}C(\\\\rho(w_0)-\\\\rho^*)+\\\\frac{2^{-T_s^{(i)}}\\\\zetab_t^{(0)}-a_t^{(0)}}{\\\\mu^2} . Since the parameters of each hidden unit converge linearly, the whole optimization problem has a linear rate of convergence.

Biography An avid reader in childhood, Marcelo Leonart wrote his first play, No salgas esta noche, in 1991. He developed his skills by attending the literary workshops of , Antonio Sk√°rmeta, and Carlos Franz. It was in the last of these where he finished Mujer desnuda fumando en la ventana, his first book, which was published in 1999. Some of the stories of that collection had already received awards, and the 2008 film ', by , is based on one of them. The following year, he was part of the scriptwriting team of the television series Roman√©. He went on to write for several other series. In 2012 he moved from TVN to Canal 13. As a dramatist, Leonart has written a series of pieces, and among the most recent he has directed is El taller. Written by Nona Fern√°ndez and premiered in 2012, it is inspired by the literary workshop that Mariana Callejas had at her home in , while her husband Michael Townley directed the operations of a DINA barracks in the basement. His first novel, Fotos de Laura, was applauded by critics and awarded, as was his second compilation of stories, La educaci√≥n. After these two books appeared in 2012, he published the novels Lacra, La patria ‚Äì whose main character is Francisco Javier Cuadra, minister of Augusto Pinochet ‚Äì and Pascua, \\"which has at its center the abuses committed by priests.\\" As a filmmaker, Leonart co-directed, together with Paulo Avil√©s, the film Grita (based on his homonymous theatrical work), which premiered in 2009 at the Santiago International Film Festival. He has a son, Dante, with his partner, the writer Nona Fern√°ndez, whom he met when they both studied at the Theater School of the Catholic University. In 2004 the couple founded the theater company La Fusa, with which Leonart staged all his works from Grita to Liceo de ni√±as. The latter premiered in 2015, and with it the company was renamed La Pieza Oscura.

Often referred to as Thompson's motif-index, the catalogue has historically received extensive use in folklore studies, where folklorists commonly use it in tandem with the Aarne‚ÄìThompson‚ÄìUther Index, an index used for folktale type analysis.  As standard tools  The motif-index and the AT or ATU indices are admitted to be standard tools in the field. For example, folklorist Mary Beth Stein says, \\"Together with Thompson's six-volume Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, with which it is cross-indexed, The Types of Folktale constitutes the most important reference work and research tool for comparative folk-tale analysis\\" Stein (2015:1). Alan Dundes who was its outspoken critic also said substantially the same thing, without even confining the application to comparative studies: \\"[the indices] index constitute two of the most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis\\".Dundes (1997: 195) Concise outlines of both indexes appear in Thompson's The Folktale (1946).Thompson (1977 [1946]: 481-500). Terminology In the context of the index, Thompson has defined motif as follows: > \\"A motif is the smallest element in a tale having a power to persist in > tradition. In order to have this power it must have something unusual and > striking about it\\". (The Folktale 1946) Thompson (1977: 415). But in the _Motif-index_ itself, Thompson had also provided a more \\"cautious\\" definition:Benson (1999: 23) > \\"[a]nything that goes to make up a traditional narrative... When the term > motif is employed, it is always in a very loose sense, and is made to > include any of the elements of narrative structure\\".Motif-index 19 This use of the noun motif is specialized to the field of folklore studies. According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), folkloristic use of the noun motif is not summed up in the definition for literary criticism (‚ÄúMotif,‚Äù def. 3a), but deserves its own separate sense of this definition (‚ÄúMotif,‚Äù def. 3b).‚ÄúMotif.‚Äù Def. 3a and 3b. 2008. Oxford English Dictionary Online Database. 3rd ed. Oxford, Oxford UP, 1989. Web. 10 December 2011. Similarly, the compound noun motif index is used in cultural anthropology to denote \\"an index of standard motifs, esp. those found in folk tales\\" (OED, ‚ÄúMotif Index,‚Äù def. C2).‚ÄúMotif Index.‚Äù Def. C2. 2008. Oxford English Dictionary Online Database. 3rd ed. Oxford, Oxford UP. Web. 10 December 2011. System Thompson discusses composing the Motif-Index of Folk-Literature in his autobiography, A Folklorist's Progress: Reflection of a Scholar's Life.Cf. Thompson (1996: 89, 100, 307). In producing the motif-index, Thompson built upon the research of Finnish folklorist Antti Aarne, who in 1910 published an index of European tale-types, Thompson himself had revised in 1928 to cover the region from Europe to Asia: this is known as the Aarne-Thompson tale type index.Uther (2004: 284-286). In his Motif-Index, Thompson then compiled, classified, and numbered the traditional motifs of the mostly European folktale types in the tale-type index.Dundes (1997: 195-202). Thompson's motif-index organizes thousands of motifs. Entries are first organized by an umbrella topic (for example, category S is \\"Unnatural Cruelty\\"). Entries are then divided into more specific subcategories. For example, entry S50 \\"Cruel relatives-in-law\\" contains the sub-entry S51.1 \\"Cruel mother-in-law plans death of daughter-in- law\\".

Miscellaneous Groups of Motifs } Relation to tale type index There has been expressed the idea that a combined set of motifs (in the motif-index) may constitute a folktale narrative (cf. the description of the Motif-Index as \\"a huge catalogue of folk narratives elements that may variously combine to form whole folk narratives\\" by Jan Harold Brunvand). This idea had already been anticipated by Alexander Veselovsky who wrote that \\"cluster of motifs\\" constituted a \\"plot\\", influencing Russian formalists like Vladimir Propp, whose study prefigured Stith Thompson's Motif-Index, as has been pointed out.Benson (1999: 23‚Äì24, 252‚Äì253 n9, 10) In the book The Folktale, Stith Thompson invokes this phrase \\"cluster of motifs\\" in several passages, as here, in connection with tales involving the dead helper: :The chain of circumstances by which this helper joins the hero and certain details of his later experience are so uniform and well articulated as to form an easily recognizable motif, or rather cluster of motifs. This fact has caused some confusion to scholars who have not sufficiently distinguished between such a motif and the entire tale of which it forms only an important part.Thompson (1977:50). But in this instance, Thompson is warning that the motif cluster is rather \\"only a framework for the adventures of the hero\\", containing \\"at least three different tales within\\".Thompson (1977:52). Thompson also explains that a single motif may be found in numerous folktales ‚Äúfrom all parts of the earth‚Äù (383).

It was founded by the Missionary Sisters, Servants of the Holy Spirit, commonly identified by the acronym SSpS, in 1975. Since its inception, has been headed by Missionary Sisters from the religious congregation within the Catholic Church. Bishop Bowers is a preparatory school with a kindergarten, primary and junior high school department. The kindergarten and primary department is located in Lartebiokorshie, and the junior high school is located in Korle-Bu.  History  * Bishop Bowers School was founded by the Missionary Sisters, Servants of the Holy Spirit in 1975. * It was named after the Late Bishop Emeritus of Accra, Bishop Joseph Oliver Bowers, in commemoration of his efforts in promoting education in the then catholic diocese of Accra: now catholic archdiocese of Accra. * In September 1975, Sis. Virginalis, SSpS from Netherlands, together with 5 teachers and two office staff members moved from sister school St. Theresa's School to start the school. * The school opened its doors to 226 pupils from kindergarten to class 5. * These were pupils who lived around Larterbiorkorshie, Mamprobi and Korle- Bu but attended St. Thera's School (also founded by Missionary Sisters, Servants of the Holy Spirit) in North Kaneshie * In 2015, Bishop Bowers School celebrated 40 years of providing quality education and a moral foundation to students.  Mission and aim  The mission of the school is to deliver holistic and quality education to pupils by: * Encouraging systematic and consistent learning habits * Promoting and rewarding the hard work and stewardship of students * Teaching and transmitting moral values such as discipline, courtesy and justice into pupils and students * Developing a spirit of unity, loyalty, harmony, love and compassion. * Raising disciplined, dedicated, god-fearing and moral citizens for the Church and nation. The aim of the school is to provide quality education and discipline through effective teaching and learning to children of the catholic faith, as well as the general public.  Motto and colours  The motto of the school is ‚ÄúKnowledge, Love and Service‚Äù and the school colors are yellow and blue  Curriculum  Teaching syllabus used in providing pupils and students with basic education is in accordance with the approved Ghana Education Service (GES) syllabus in preparation to sit the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE), conducted by the West African Examination Council (WAEC), needed to gain admissions into Senior High Schools.  Primary  The primary department is located at No.3 Hutton Mills Street, Zoti, Lartebiokorshie. It has three main blocks which makes up the administration, classrooms and assemblyhall, computer laboratory, carteen, lavatories, a library and staff common room. There is also a large playground.  Junior High School  In 1987, a request for the release of land to establish a junior high school was sent to the secretary of health through the medical administrator of Korle Bu teaching Hospital. A land was offered beside near the nurse's flats for the construction of Bishop Bowers Junior High School.  Class structures  Both primary and junior high school department have classes with two streams. The KG1 classes are named after co-founders of the Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit. The KG2 classes are named after the Holy Spirit Missionary Congregation Sisters to first arrive in Ghana in 1946. Each primary class is named after a flower to inspire beauty and character in both academic performance and character if pupils. The junior high school classes are named after saints, to inspire exemplary behaviour.  List of past and current headmistresses  * Sis Virginalis SSpS * Sis. Velma SSpS * Sis. Mary Lauren SSpS * Sis.

O‚ÄôNeill is currently a Principal Investigator at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, United Kingdom.https://www2.mrc- lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/n-to-s/john-oneill/ Laboratory Website His work focuses on the fundamental mechanisms that sustain circadian rhythms in eukaryotic cells. Academic career O'Neill studied undergraduate biochemistry at New College, Oxford. He went on to join King's College, Cambridge, where he undertook his PhD research at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, under the supervision of Michael Hastings, on the subject of cAMP signalling in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN). For his post-doctoral research, O‚ÄôNeill investigated circadian rhythms in plants and algae with Andrew Millar at the University of Edinburgh and then subsequently in human cells at the Institute for Metabolic Science at the University of Cambridge. During this time, O‚ÄôNeill contributed to a number of papers on non-transcriptional mechanisms of circadian timekeeping, most notably a letter and an article in same edition of Nature showing that transcriptional cycles are not essential for circadian rhythms in human and algal cells, which have been cited 516 and 362 times respectively, according to Google Scholar. These observations were subsequently independently replicated and extended but were considered controversial at the time since transcriptional feedback repression had been thought essential for circadian rhythms in eukaryotes. O'Neill was awarded a Wellcome Trust Career Development Fellowship in 2011 and continued his post-doctoral work until 2013, when was recruited to become an independent group leader in the Cell Biology Division of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. In 2016, he was awarded an EMBO Young Investigator Prize. In collaboration with Cairn Research, O'Neill pioneered the development of the ALLIGATOR for long-term bioluminescence imaging. =Current Research= The O'Neill group‚Äôs research is focused on the evolution and mechanisms of circadian timekeeping in eukaryotic cells, and how biological clocks regulate cellular function to impact upon human health and disease. Most recently, the group published an article in Cell identifying insulin as a primary signal synchronizing mammalian circadian rhythms with feeding time. In 2017, the lab also demonstrated that cell-autonomous circadian regulation of actin dynamics in fibroblast and other skin cells leads to differences in cell migration during wound healing that depend on the biological time of day that the wound was incurred.

Degas was a French artist known for his pastels, paintings, sculptures, prints, and charcoal drawings. Thomson, Richard. ‚ÄúDegas in Edinburgh.‚Äù This pastel is part of a series of works that have cafe-concert singers as their subject. Degas was a habitu√© of those places, especially the Cafe des Ambassadeurs, and he uses them as the settings for many of his works. Ballet Rehearsal (1873) and The Ballet Class (1874) also depict performers both on stage and in practice. Degas is especially identified with the subject of dance; more than half of his works depict dancers alone. He is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism, although he rejected the term, and preferred to think of himself as a realist. Singer with a Glove has been in the Fogg Museum collection since 1951. The Fogg Museum, which is associated with Harvard University along with two other museums and four research centers, has a permanent Degas exhibition with nearly 70 pieces in the collection. The Fogg was the first museum to mount an exhibition of works by Degas, which became a pivotal moment in his lifetime. DeVonyar, Jill. ‚ÄúDegas in New England.‚Äù At the first Fogg showing attendance reached 550, which at the time was considered a success.  Composition  Singer with a Glove consists of bright and dark colors. The singer, who has a pale complexion, wears a black-glove and pink toned dress. In the background there are long washes of orange-red, light green, and pale yellow. There are scribbles of light reflecting white onto the woman‚Äôs arm, chest, and face, and the black around the dress‚Äôs neckline and sleeve imply feathers without showing individual feathers or lines. Her face holds an operatic note, her eyes focus on her raised gloved-hand, and her red hair is pulled back into a low bun. A dark shadow is cast over her eyes and top of her head. The singer's hair is coiffed and includes a flower, she has jewels for earrings, and her dress includes a bodice.

The Jeffress family lived in a Tudor mansion that eventually became the original clubhouse for the country club. The family began the elaborate plantings and garden on their land, and the large formal garden was later enhanced by the \\"personal stamp\\" of Charles F. Gillette, who was also working on gardens for the Virginia Governor's Executive Mansion in Richmond and on Agecroft Hall. In 2013 Lake Chesdin Golf Club merged with Meadowbrook Country Club. The idea was to consolidate and help attract members to both clubs. The two formed an LLC called: Meadowbrook-Chesdin LLC. The LLC paid $1.2 million to purchase the Chesdin course. The partnership ended in 2014 over financial concerns from the Chesdin club. Upon dissolution, members were given the choice as to which club they would settle into.  The Gardens  The Women of Meadowbrook Country Club is a non-profit women's club, a group originally founded in 1965 to preserve the historic gardens of the club which had been designed by renowned landscape architect Charles F. Gillette for the original estate grounds in Chesterfield County where the club is situated. Although the country club was founded in 1957, the gardens are much older, having been begun by the Jeffress family on their estate. The Gardens have a noteworthy Gazebo.  Golf  The original course designer was Robert Bruce Harris. In 2000, the course was upgraded and redesigned by Keith Foster at a cost of $ 2 million dollars. The 18-hole Meadowbrook course features of golf from the longest tees for a par of 71. The course is rated 71.6 and has a slope rating of 120 on Bermuda grass. The course was designed by Frederick A. Findlay and opened in 1957. The course currently features 30 tees driving range and 18 regulation holes. The course has bentgrass putting greens and bermudagrass fairways and consists of four Par 3's, nine Par 4's and five Par 5's. The course has four sets of men's tees and two sets of ladies' tees.

At the beginning of the 20th century it was the largest Roman Catholic Church in southern Ukraine.  Description  Columns of the church The Cathedral was built in Renaissance Revival architectural style; it has three aisles and two towers. The Cathedral in Salzburg, Austria was a prototype for the church. Newly built, the cathedral was marked by rich interior decoration. In 1901 a carved altar ordered from Austria was installed in the church, in 1903 a cathedra was built, in 1904 ‚Äì altar of repose. In 1906 wooden statues of Saint Anthony and the crucified Christ were set up in the cathedral. Paintings with stories from the Bible were made on the walls.  History  View of the cathedral in the early 20th century At the beginning of 19th century there was a significant inflow of the German colonists to Novorossiya at that time (modern region north of the Black Sea, Bessarabia and the Crimea). According to the manifesto of Catherine II from July 22, 1763, foreigners were invited to come to Russia and settle whenever they wanted. In the beginning of 19th century after the Napoleonic Wars, Germany being occupied by France was found in a tough economic state. And many merchants and trades people were forced to leave their home state. In 1808 the order of Tsar Alexander I went forth ‚ÄúAbout providing assistance and headright to foreign sodbusters in Novorossiya. Therefore in 1808 Kuchurhanskyi colonists‚Äô district (area) with administrative center in Selz settlement, modern urban-type settlement Lymanske. The district included six catholic colonies. Since 1821 there was a catholic church in the settlement. In 1901 on the place of the church there was a three-aisle cathedral that had two towers 57, 9 meters (1900 feet) in height. In contrast to the majority of the churches in Odessa area built of limestone only, Cathedral of the Assumption in Selz was built of bricks. The cost of brick for the Cathedral construction was 110,000 Russian roubles. = Destruction of the cathedral = In 1919 German colonists from Odessa initiated the revolt against Prodrazvyorstka (food apportionment, the partition of the requested total amount as obligations from the suppliers) and mobilizing to the Soviet Red Army. The revolt was repressed, and all possessions of the participants were captured. Thereby the cathedral was closed, and its towers were destroyed. During the soviet times the cathedral building was used for a club. When the standardized building for a club was constructed, the cathedral fell into ruin. At the moment the cathedral is in ruins. At a rough estimate its reconstruction would cost more than 6 million of dollars. The catholic community of the southern Germany initiated the idea of the church reconstruction. The requirement for the reconstruction was staying in the same denomination; the Cathedral has to belong to Roman Catholics. Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate has stood in the way of the reconstruction of this piece of architecture since it was against existence of any Catholic churches on ‚Äúits own‚Äù territories.

After the death of her father she lived together with her mother, who died in 1906, in well-off conditions in the London district of Kensington. Later, she lived with a younger woman, Eileen Florence Hodson Moriarty (1880-1945). Finn died of pneumonia at age 67. She left a fortune of ¬£ 6,000.John Saunders: Kate Belinda Finn (1864‚Äì1932), September 8, 2015  Chess career  She learned the game of chess from her mother, who often accompanied her to tournaments. Kate Finn was a founding member of the Ladies' Chess Club, which was launched in January 1895 in London. In the following months, the club members played several friendly matches against other clubs. Four members participated in a women's tournament organized during the Chess tournament at Hastings in 1895. It was won by Lady Edith Thomas, Finn finished fourth.The Ladies' Chess Club: The First Year, Chess.com, April 3, 2011 In the summer of 1897, Finn took part in the first international women's tournament, held in London and won by Mary Rudge. There were 32 entries for the tournament, from which 20 participants were selected. After eight rounds in which she scored 3.5 points, Finn did not continue playing, because warm weather and the tight schedule of 19 rounds in 11 days proved to be too exhausting for her.Joost van Winsen: The Ladies Made an International Move, Chess Archaeology, June 2016 In June 1900, Finn won the B tournament at the Annual Congress of the Kent Chess Association, in which four men and two women participated, with 4 points from 5 games. In March 1901 she won the championship of the Ladies' Chess Club. In a simultaneous exhibition on 25 boards, given by Isidor Gunsberg in December 1902, Finn was the only participant to win her game.The Ladies' Chess Club: Middle Years, Chess.com, April 11, 2011 At the 1904 British Championship in Hastings, which was organized by the newly formed British Chess Federation, she scored 10.5 points in 11 games and won with three points ahead of the runner-up. She received a cash prize of ¬£ 10 and a gold medal.BritBase Chess: 1st British Championship 1904, Hastings, 10. Oktober 2017 Subsequently, an illustrated article about her appeared in the British Chess Magazine (1904, pp. 399-400). This was the most comprehensive report to date about a female chess player in this magazine.Robert B. Tanner: Vera Menchik. McFarland, Jefferson 2016. p. 8 A year later, Finn was able to defend the title of national champion in Southport. This time she scored 9.5 points and again remained unbeaten. She did not attend the championship in 1906 because of a serious illness of her mother. In the women's tournament as part of the international chess tournament in Ostend 1907 she tied for first place with Grace Curling John Saunders: Grace Moore Curling (n√©e Ellis) (1875-1958), 1908 British Ladies' Chess Champion, March 6, 2018 and apparently won a later tiebreak match with one win and two draws.

Tournament table and games are not known.Edward Winter: San Remo, 1911, Chess Notes 6627 In later years, her eyesight diminished and her overall health deteriorated. Despite of that she played in team competitions for the Imperial Chess Club in the London League until 1931.

According to retrospective calculations, her best historical Elo rating was 2095 in the year 1905.Edo Ratings, Finn, Ms. K.B., September 22, 2017 In 1903, the Wiener Schachzeitung printed one of her games from a tournament in Plymouth, which she lost to Wilfred Charles Palmer (1873-1914) in only 10 moves. This prompted the following remark by the editor: \\"This rapid defeat is likely to mislead some psychologists to regard the game as a valuable contribution to the popular chapter \\"Inferiority of Female Intelligence.\\" On the other hand, it must be noted that Miss Finn is well acquainted with the intricacies of chess and has excelled on many previous occasions.\\" WSZ 1903, p. 290 Among the notable male chess players she defeated in tournament games are Rudolf Loman (1903), Georg Schories (1905) and George Alan Thomas (1906).Nonne allo sbaraglio!, SoloScacchi, November 1, 2011 References  External links  * Pictures of Kate Belinda Finn in the Cleveland Public Library collection: 1897, 1905, 1905 Category:1864 births Category:1932 deaths Category:British female chess players Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:People from Cork (city) ","title":"Kate Belinda Finn"},{"id":"57222986","text":"Taphrocerus albodistinctus is a species of metallic wood-boring beetle in the family Buprestidae.

The school hosts nontraditional classroom programs for Howard County students in grades 6-12.  History  In 2001, the Board of Education of Howard County, Maryland began soliciting bids for the construction of a new Alternative Learning Center. The Homewood Center was built in 2002 near the historic Homewood estate. The name was selected by a committee who chose not to add the words \\"Alternative Learning Center.\\" A spokesperson reported that \\"we wanted to make the school as elegant as we could possibly make it.\\" Homewood is located on the same campus as the Applications and Research Lab and the HCPSS central offices. It is part of the Howard County Public School System. The school does not have a Parent-Teacher Association. In 2004, the principal of Oakland Mills High School was transferred by the Howard County Public School System superintendent to Homewood School amid a grade-changing scandal. Consequently, the current principal of Homewood was moved to fill the vacancy at Oakland Mills.  Academics  The Homewood Center hosts nontraditional classroom programs for middle and high school students. These courses are often designed for students who have not performed well in conventional classroom settings. This may be due to \\"legal infractions, behavior challenges, or emotional disabilities.\\" Students attend Homewood on \\"referral\\" from other county middle and high schools. Homewood has three special education programs. One of these programs, Gateway, is designed for students with behavioral problems. In 2004, officials designated the Homewood Center as a trouble facility under the federal No Child Left Behind Act. This was because the Center did not show signs of improvement after two consecutive years. The school was entered into the state school improvement program where it would receive additional support and resources, but face strict administrative regulation. Starting in 2007, Homewood hosts an annual career fair to help students learn about different career opportunities. Local business owners and other professionals come to give presentations. Members of the student government serve as hosts for these local speakers. Since 2012, the Center implements restorative practices. These practices are required to take place at least once a week in every class, sometimes in the form of a \\"restorative justice circle.\\" According to state data, in 2012, 87.1 percent of the students at the Center passed the required high school standardized assessments in algebra and data analysis, biology, and English.
