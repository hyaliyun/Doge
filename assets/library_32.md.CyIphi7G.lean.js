The planning aspects of transportation engineering relate to elements of urban planning, and involve technical forecasting decisions and political factors. Technical forecasting of passenger travel usually involves an urban transportation planning model, requiring the estimation of trip generation (number of purposeful trips), trip distribution (destination choice, where the traveler is going), mode choice (mode that is being taken), and route assignment (the streets or routes that are being used). More sophisticated forecasting can include other aspects of traveler decisions, including auto ownership, trip chaining (the decision to link individual trips together in a tour) and the choice of residential or business location (known as land use forecasting). Passenger trips are the focus of transportation engineering because they often represent the peak of demand on any transportation system. A review of descriptions of the scope of various committees indicates that while facility planning and design continue to be the core of the transportation engineering field, such areas as operations planning, logistics, network analysis, financing, and policy analysis are also important, particularly to those working in highway and urban transportation. The National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) list online the safety protocols, geometric design requirements, and signal timing. Transportation engineering, primarily involves planning, design, construction, maintenance, and operation of transportation facilities. The facilities support air, highway, railroad, pipeline, water, and even space transportation. The design aspects of transportation engineering include the sizing of transportation facilities (how many lanes or how much capacity the facility has), determining the materials and thickness used in pavement designing the geometry (vertical and horizontal alignment) of the roadway (or track). Before any planning occurs an engineer must take what is known as an inventory of the area or, if it is appropriate, the previous system in place. This inventory or database must include information on population, land use, economic activity, transportation facilities and services, travel patterns and volumes, laws and ordinances, regional financial resources, and community values and expectations. These inventories help the engineer create business models to complete accurate forecasts of the future conditions of the system. Operations and management involve traffic engineering, so that vehicles move smoothly on the road or track. Older techniques include signs, signals, markings, and tolling. Newer technologies involve intelligent transportation systems, including advanced traveler information systems (such as variable message signs), advanced traffic control systems (such as ramp meters), and vehicle infrastructure integration. Human factors are an aspect of transportation engineering, particularly concerning driver-vehicle interface and user interface of road signs, signals, and markings. Highway engineering Engineers in this specialization: *Handle the planning, design, construction, and operation of highways, roads, and other vehicular facilities as well as their related bicycle and pedestrian realms *Estimate the transportation needs of the public and then secure the funding for projects *Analyze locations of high traffic volumes and high collisions for safety and capacity *Use engineering principles to improve the transportation system *Utilize the three design controls, which are the drivers, the vehicles, and the roadways themselves Railroad engineering Railway engineers handle the design, construction, and operation of railroads and mass transit systems that use a fixed guideway (such as light rail or monorails). Typical tasks include determining horizontal and vertical alignment design, station location and design, and construction cost estimating. Railroad engineers can also move into the specialized field of train dispatching which focuses on train movement control. Railway engineers also work to build a cleaner and safer transportation network by reinvesting and revitalizing the rail system to meet future demands. In the United States, railway engineers work with elected officials in Washington, D.C. on rail transportation issues to make sure that the rail system meets the country's transportation needs. Port and harbor engineering Port and harbor engineers handle the design, construction, and operation of ports, harbors, canals, and other maritime facilities. Airport engineering Airport engineers design and construct airports. Airport engineers must account for the impacts and demands of aircraft in their design of airport facilities. These engineers must use the analysis of predominant wind direction to determine runway orientation, determine the size of runway border and safety areas, different wing tip to wing tip clearances for all gates and must designate the clear zones in the entire port.

In this image, servers are represented by circles, queues by a series of rectangles and the routing network by arrows. In the study of queue networks one typically tries to obtain the equilibrium distribution of the network, although in many applications the study of the transient state is fundamental. Queueing theory is the mathematical study of waiting lines, or queues. A queueing model is constructed so that queue lengths and waiting time can be predicted. Queueing theory is generally considered a branch of operations research because the results are often used when making business decisions about the resources needed to provide a service. Queueing theory has its origins in research by Agner Krarup Erlang when he created models to describe the system of Copenhagen Telephone Exchange company, a Danish company. The ideas have since seen applications including telecommunication, traffic engineering, computing and, particularly in industrial engineering, in the design of factories, shops, offices and hospitals, as well as in project management.  Spelling  The spelling \\"queueing\\" over \\"queuing\\" is typically encountered in the academic research field. In fact, one of the flagship journals of the profession is Queueing Systems.  Single queueing nodes  A queue, or queueing node can be thought of as nearly a black box. Jobs or \\"customers\\" arrive to the queue, possibly wait some time, take some time being processed, and then depart from the queue. A black box. Jobs arrive to, and depart from, the queue. The queueing node is not quite a pure black box, however, since some information is needed about the inside of the queuing node. The queue has one or more \\"servers\\" which can each be paired with an arriving job until it departs, after which that server will be free to be paired with another arriving job. A queueing node with 3 servers. Server a is idle, and thus an arrival is given to it to process. Server b is currently busy and will take some time before it can complete service of its job. Server c has just completed service of a job and thus will be next to receive an arriving job. An analogy often used is that of the cashier at a supermarket. There are other models, but this is one commonly encountered in the literature. Customers arrive, are processed by the cashier, and depart. Each cashier processes one customer at a time, and hence this is a queueing node with only one server. A setting where a customer will leave immediately if the cashier is busy when the customer arrives, is referred to as a queue with no buffer (or no \\"waiting area\\", or similar terms). A setting with a waiting zone for up to n customers is called a queue with a buffer of size n. = Birth- death process = The behaviour of a single queue (also called a \\"queueing node\\") can be described by a birth‚Äìdeath process, which describes the arrivals and departures from the queue, along with the number of jobs (also called \\"customers\\" or \\"requests\\", or any number of other things, depending on the field) currently in the system. An arrival increases the number of jobs by 1, and a departure (a job completing its service) decreases k by 1. A birth‚Äìdeath process. The values in the circles represent the state of the birth-death process. For a queueing system, k is the number of jobs in the system (either being serviced or waiting if the queue has a buffer of waiting jobs). The system transitions between values of k by \\"births\\" and \\"deaths\\" which occur at rates given by various values of Œªi and Œºi, respectively. Further, for a queue, the arrival rates and departure rates are generally considered not to vary with the number of jobs in the queue, so a single average rate of arrivals/departures per unit time to the queue is assumed. Under this assumption, this process has an arrival rate of Œª = Œª1, Œª2, ..., Œªk and a departure rate of Œº = Œº1, Œº2, ..., Œºk (see next figure). A queue with 1 server, arrival rate Œª and departure rate Œº.  Balance equations  The steady state equations for the birth-and-death process, known as the balance equations, are as follows. Here P_n denotes the steady state probability to be in state n. : \\\\mu_1 P_1 = \\\\lambda_0 P_0 : \\\\lambda_0 P_0 + \\\\mu_2 P_2 = (\\\\lambda_1 + \\\\mu_1) P_1 : \\\\lambda_{n-1} P_{n-1} + \\\\mu_{n+1} P_{n+1} = (\\\\lambda_n + \\\\mu_n) P_n The first two equations imply : P_1 = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_0}{\\\\mu_1} P_0 and : P_2 = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_1}{\\\\mu_2} P_1 + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_2} (\\\\mu_1 P_1 - \\\\lambda_0 P_0) = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_1}{\\\\mu_2} P_1 = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_1 \\\\lambda_0}{\\\\mu_2 \\\\mu_1} P_0. By mathematical induction, : P_n = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{n-1} \\\\lambda_{n-2} \\\\cdots \\\\lambda_0}{\\\\mu_n \\\\mu_{n-1} \\\\cdots \\\\mu_1} P_0 = P_0 \\\\prod_{i = 0}^{n-1} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_i}{\\\\mu_{i+1}}. The condition \\\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\\\infty} P_n = P_0 + P_0 \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_i}{\\\\mu_{i+1}} = 1 leads to: : P_0 = \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_i}{\\\\mu_{i+1}} }, which, together with the equation for P_n (n\\\\geq1), fully describes the required steady state probabilities. = Kendall's notation = Single queueing nodes are usually described using Kendall's notation in the form A/S/c where A describes the distribution of durations between each arrival to the queue, S the distribution of service times for jobs and c the number of servers at the node.Tijms, H.C, Algorithmic Analysis of Queues\\", Chapter 9 in A First Course in Stochastic Models, Wiley, Chichester, 2003 For an example of the notation, the M/M/1 queue is a simple model where a single server serves jobs that arrive according to a Poisson process (where inter-arrival durations are exponentially distributed) and have exponentially distributed service times (the M denotes a Markov process). In an M/G/1 queue, the G stands for \\"general\\" and indicates an arbitrary probability distribution for service times. = Example analysis of an M/M/1 queue = Consider a queue with one server and the following characteristics: * Œª: the arrival rate (the expected time between each customer arriving, e.g. 30 seconds); * Œº: the reciprocal of the mean service time (the expected number of consecutive service completions per the same unit time, e.g. per 30 seconds); * n: the parameter characterizing the number of customers in the system; * Pn: the probability of there being n customers in the system in steady state. Further, let En represent the number of times the system enters state n, and Ln represent the number of times the system leaves state n. Then for all n, En ‚àí Ln‚àà {0, 1}. That is, the number of times the system leaves a state differs by at most 1 from the number of times it enters that state, since it will either return into that state at some time in the future (En = Ln) or not (En ‚àí Ln= 1). When the system arrives at a steady state, the arrival rate should be equal to the departure rate. Thus the balance equations : \\\\mu P_1 = \\\\lambda P_0 : \\\\lambda P_0 + \\\\mu P_2 = (\\\\lambda + \\\\mu) P_1 : \\\\lambda P_{n-1} + \\\\mu P_{n+1} = (\\\\lambda + \\\\mu) P_n imply : P_n = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\mu} P_{n-1},\\\\ n=1,2,\\\\ldots The fact that P_0 + P_1 + \\\\cdots = 1 leads to the geometric distribution formula : P_n = (1 - \\\\rho) \\\\rho^n where \\\\rho = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\mu} < 1. = Simple two-equation queue = A common basic queuing system is attributed to Erlang, and is a modification of Little's Law. Given an arrival rate Œª, a dropout rate œÉ, and a departure rate Œº, length of the queue L is defined as: : L = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda - \\\\sigma}{\\\\mu}. Assuming an exponential distribution for the rates, the waiting time W can be defined as the proportion of arrivals that are served. This is equal to the exponential survival rate of those who do not drop out over the waiting period, giving: : \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\lambda} = e^{-W{\\\\mu}} The second equation is commonly rewritten as: : W = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu} \\\\mathrm{ln}\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\mu} The two-stage one-box model is common in epidemiology.  Overview of the development of the theory  In 1909, Agner Krarup Erlang, a Danish engineer who worked for the Copenhagen Telephone Exchange, published the first paper on what would now be called queueing theory. He modeled the number of telephone calls arriving at an exchange by a Poisson process and solved the M/D/1 queue in 1917 and M/D/k queueing model in 1920. In Kendall's notation: * M stands for Markov or memoryless and means arrivals occur according to a Poisson process; * D stands for deterministic and means jobs arriving at the queue which require a fixed amount of service; * k describes the number of servers at the queueing node (k = 1, 2, ...). If there are more jobs at the node than there are servers, then jobs will queue and wait for service The M/G/1 queue was solved by Felix Pollaczek in 1930,Pollaczek, F., Ueber eine Aufgabe der Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie, Math. Z. 1930 a solution later recast in probabilistic terms by Aleksandr Khinchin and now known as the Pollaczek‚ÄìKhinchine formula. After the 1940s queueing theory became an area of research interest to mathematicians. In 1953 David George Kendall solved the GI/M/k queueKendall, D.G.:Stochastic processes occurring in the theory of queues and their analysis by the method of the imbedded Markov chain, Ann. Math. Stat. 1953 and introduced the modern notation for queues, now known as Kendall's notation. In 1957 Pollaczek studied the GI/G/1 using an integral equation.Pollaczek, F., Probl√®mes Stochastiques pos√©s par le ph√©nom√®ne de formation d'une queue John Kingman gave a formula for the mean waiting time in a G/G/1 queue: Kingman's formula. Leonard Kleinrock worked on the application of queueing theory to message switching (in the early 1960s) and packet switching (in the early 1970s). His initial contribution to this field was his doctoral thesis at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1962, published in book form in 1964 in the field of message switching. His theoretical work published in the early 1970s underpinned the use of packet switching in the ARPANET, a forerunner to the Internet. The matrix geometric method and matrix analytic methods have allowed queues with phase-type distributed inter-arrival and service time distributions to be considered. Systems with coupled orbits are an important part in queueing theory in the application to wireless networks and signal processing. Problems such as performance metrics for the M/G/k queue remain an open problem.  Service disciplines  First in first out (FIFO) queue example. Various scheduling policies can be used at queuing nodes: ; First in first out: Also called first-come, first-served (FCFS), this principle states that customers are served one at a time and that the customer that has been waiting the longest is served first.Penttinen A., Chapter 8 - Queueing Systems, Lecture Notes: S-38.145 - Introduction to Teletraffic Theory. ; Last in first out: This principle also serves customers one at a time, but the customer with the shortest waiting time will be served first. Also known as a stack. ; Processor sharing: Service capacity is shared equally between customers. ; Priority: Customers with high priority are served first. Priority queues can be of two types, non-preemptive (where a job in service cannot be interrupted) and preemptive (where a job in service can be interrupted by a higher-priority job). No work is lost in either model. ; Shortest job first: The next job to be served is the one with the smallest size ; Preemptive shortest job first: The next job to be served is the one with the original smallest size ; Shortest remaining processing time: The next job to serve is the one with the smallest remaining processing requirement. ; Service facility * Single server: customers line up and there is only one server * Several parallel servers‚ÄìSingle queue: customers line up and there are several servers * Several servers‚ÄìSeveral queues: there are many counters and customers can decide going where to queue ; Unreliable server Server failures occur according to a stochastic process (usually Poisson) and are followed by the setup periods during which the server is unavailable. The interrupted customer remains in the service area until server is fixed. ; Customer's behavior of waiting * Balking: customers deciding not to join the queue if it is too long * Jockeying: customers switch between queues if they think they will get served faster by doing so * Reneging: customers leave the queue if they have waited too long for service Arriving customers not served (either due to the queue having no buffer, or due to balking or reneging by the customer) are also known as dropouts and the average rate of dropouts is a significant parameter describing a queue.  Queueing networks  Networks of queues are systems in which a number of queues are connected by what's known as customer routing. When a customer is serviced at one node it can join another node and queue for service, or leave the network. For networks of m nodes, the state of the system can be described by an m‚Äìdimensional vector (x1, x2, ..., xm) where xi represents the number of customers at each node. The simplest non-trivial network of queues is called tandem queues.http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~winkel/bs3a07l13-14.pdf#page=4 The first significant results in this area were Jackson networks, for which an efficient product-form stationary distribution exists and the mean value analysis which allows average metrics such as throughput and sojourn times to be computed. If the total number of customers in the network remains constant the network is called a closed network and has also been shown to have a product‚Äìform stationary distribution in the Gordon‚ÄìNewell theorem. This result was extended to the BCMP network where a network with very general service time, regimes and customer routing is shown to also exhibit a product-form stationary distribution. The normalizing constant can be calculated with the Buzen's algorithm, proposed in 1973. Networks of customers have also been investigated, Kelly networks where customers of different classes experience different priority levels at different service nodes. Another type of network are G-networks first proposed by Erol Gelenbe in 1993: these networks do not assume exponential time distributions like the classic Jackson Network. = Routing algorithms = In discrete time networks where there is a constraint on which service nodes can be active at any time, the max-weight scheduling algorithm chooses a service policy to give optimal throughput in the case that each job visits only a single person service node. In the more general case where jobs can visit more than one node, backpressure routing gives optimal throughput. A network scheduler must choose a queuing algorithm, which affects the characteristics of the larger network. See also Stochastic scheduling for more about scheduling of queueing systems. = Mean field limits = Mean field models consider the limiting behaviour of the empirical measure (proportion of queues in different states) as the number of queues (m above) goes to infinity. The impact of other queues on any given queue in the network is approximated by a differential equation. The deterministic model converges to the same stationary distribution as the original model. = Heavy traffic/diffusion approximations = In a system with high occupancy rates (utilisation near 1) a heavy traffic approximation can be used to approximate the queueing length process by a reflected Brownian motion, Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck process, or more general diffusion process. The number of dimensions of the Brownian process is equal to the number of queueing nodes, with the diffusion restricted to the non-negative orthant. = Fluid limits = Fluid models are continuous deterministic analogs of queueing networks obtained by taking the limit when the process is scaled in time and space, allowing heterogeneous objects. This scaled trajectory converges to a deterministic equation which allows the stability of the system to be proven. It is known that a queueing network can be stable, but have an unstable fluid limit.

Its chemical name is zirconium silicate, and its corresponding chemical formula is ZrSiO4. A common empirical formula showing some of the range of substitution in zircon is (Zr1‚Äìy, REEy)(SiO4)1‚Äìx(OH)4x‚Äìy. Zircon forms in silicate melts with large proportions of high field strength incompatible elements. For example, hafnium is almost always present in quantities ranging from 1 to 4%. The crystal structure of zircon is tetragonal crystal system. The natural colour of zircon varies between colourless, yellow-golden, red, brown, blue and green. The name derives from the Persian zargun, meaning \\"gold-hued\\". This word is corrupted into \\"jargoon\\", a term applied to light-colored zircons. The English word \\"zircon\\" is derived from Zirkon, which is the German adaptation of this word. Yellow, orange and red zircon is also known as \\"hyacinth\\", from the flower hyacinthus, whose name is of Ancient Greek origin. Properties Optical microscope photograph; the length of the crystal is about 250 ¬µm Zircon is common in the crust of Earth. It occurs as a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks (as primary crystallization products), in metamorphic rocks and as detrital grains in sedimentary rocks. Large zircon crystals are rare. Their average size in granite rocks is about 0.1‚Äì0.3 mm, but they can also grow to sizes of several centimeters, especially in mafic pegmatites and carbonatites. Zircon is also very resistant to heat and corrosion. Because of their uranium and thorium content, some zircons undergo metamictization. Connected to internal radiation damage, these processes partially disrupt the crystal structure and partly explain the highly variable properties of zircon. As zircon becomes more and more modified by internal radiation damage, the density decreases, the crystal structure is compromised, and the color changes. Zircon occurs in many colors, including reddish brown, yellow, green, blue, gray and colorless. The color of zircons can sometimes be changed by heat treatment. Common brown zircons can be transformed into colorless and blue zircons by heating to 800 to 1000 ¬∞C. In geological settings, the development of pink, red, and purple zircon occurs after hundreds of millions of years, if the crystal has sufficient trace elements to produce color centers. Color in this red or pink series is annealed in geological conditions above temperatures of around 400 ¬∞C. Applications Sand-sized grains of zircon Zircon is mainly consumed as an opacifier, and has been known to be used in the decorative ceramics industry. It is also the principal precursor not only to metallic zirconium, although this application is small, but also to all compounds of zirconium including zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), one of the most refractory materials known. Other applications include use in refractories and foundry casting and a growing array of specialty applications as zirconia and zirconium chemicals, including in nuclear fuel rods, catalytic fuel converters and in water and air purification systems. Zircon is one of the key minerals used by geologists for geochronology. Zircon is a part of the ZTR index to classify highly-weathered sediments. Occurrence World production trend of zirconium mineral concentrates Zircon is a common accessory to trace mineral constituent of most granite and felsic igneous rocks. Due to its hardness, durability and chemical inertness, zircon persists in sedimentary deposits and is a common constituent of most sands. Zircon is rare within mafic rocks and very rare within ultramafic rocks aside from a group of ultrapotassic intrusive rocks such as kimberlites, carbonatites, and lamprophyre, where zircon can occasionally be found as a trace mineral owing to the unusual magma genesis of these rocks. Zircon forms economic concentrations within heavy mineral sands ore deposits, within certain pegmatites, and within some rare alkaline volcanic rocks, for example the Toongi Trachyte, Dubbo, New South Wales Australia in association with the zirconium-hafnium minerals eudialyte and armstrongite. Australia leads the world in zircon mining, producing 37% of the world total and accounting for 40% of world EDR (economic demonstrated resources) for the mineral. South Africa is Africa's main producer, with 30% of world production, second after Australia. Radiometric dating SEM-CL image of Zircon grain showing zonations and poly-cycles (core-rim structure) Zircon has played an important role during the evolution of radiometric dating. Zircons contain trace amounts of uranium and thorium (from 10 ppm up to 1 wt%) and can be dated using several modern analytical techniques. Because zircons can survive geologic processes like erosion, transport, even high-grade metamorphism, they contain a rich and varied record of geological processes. Currently, zircons are typically dated by uranium-lead (U-Pb), fission-track, cathodoluminescence, and U+Th/He techniques. For instance, imaging the cathodoluminescence emission from fast electrons can be used as a prescreening tool for high-resolution secondary-ion-mass spectrometry (SIMS) to image the zonation pattern and identify regions of interest for isotope analysis. This is done using an integrated cathodoluminescence and scanning electron microscope. Zircons in sedimentary rock can identify the sediment source. Zircons from Jack Hills in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, have yielded U-Pb ages up to 4.404 billion years, interpreted to be the age of crystallization, making them the oldest minerals so far dated on Earth. In addition, the oxygen isotopic compositions of some of these zircons have been interpreted to indicate that more than 4.4 billion years ago there was already water on the surface of the Earth. This interpretation is supported by additional trace element data, but is also the subject of debate.

It is considered to be the most successful World's Fair of the 20th century\\"The Most Successful World Fair ‚Äì Expo 67\\". Voices of East Anglia with the most attendees to that date and 62 nations participating. It also set the single-day attendance record for a world's fair, with 569,500 visitors on its third day. Expo 67 was Canada's main celebration during its centennial year. The fair had been intended to be held in Moscow, to help the Soviet Union celebrate the Russian Revolution's 50th anniversary; however, for various reasons, the Soviets decided to cancel, and Canada was awarded it in late 1962. The project was not well supported in Canada at first. It took the determination of Montreal's mayor, Jean Drapeau, and a new team of managers to guide it past political, physical and temporal hurdles. Defying a computer analysis that said it could not be done, the fair opened on time. After Expo 67 ended in October 1967, the site and most of the pavilions continued on as an exhibition called Man and His World, open during the summer months from 1968 until 1984. By that time, most of the buildings‚Äîwhich had not been designed to last beyond the original exhibition‚Äîhad deteriorated and were dismantled. Today, the islands that hosted the world exhibition are mainly used as parkland and for recreational use, with only a few remaining structures from Expo 67 to show that the event was held there. History =Background= Expo 67 passport The idea of hosting the 1967 World Exhibition dates back to 1957. \\"I believe it was Colonel Sevigny who first asked me to do what I could to bring Canada's selection as the site for the international exposition in 1967.\\" Montreal's mayor, Sarto Fournier, backed the proposal, allowing Canada to make a bid to the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE). At the BIE's May 5, 1960 meeting in Paris, Moscow was awarded the fair after five rounds of voting that eliminated Austria's and then Canada's bids. In April 1962, the Soviets scrapped plans to host the fair because of financial constraints and security concerns. Montreal's new mayor, Jean Drapeau, lobbied the Canadian government to try again for the fair, which they did. On November 13, 1962, the BIE changed the location of the World Exhibition to Canada, and Expo 67 went on to become the second-best attended BIE-sanctioned world exposition, after the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. (It is now fourth, having been surpassed by Osaka (1970) and Shanghai (2010).) Several sites were proposed as the main Expo grounds. One location that was considered was Mount Royal Park, to the north of the downtown core. But it was Drapeau's idea to create new islands in the St. Lawrence river, and to enlarge the existing Saint Helen's Island. The choice overcame opposition from Montreal's surrounding municipalities, and also prevented land speculation.Berton, p. 260 =Key people= Quebec and Ontario pavilions in view Expo did not get off to a smooth start; in 1963, many top organizing committee officials resigned. The main reason for the resignations was Mayor Drapeau's choice of the site on new islands to be created around the existing St. Helen's Island and also that a computer program predicted that the event could not possibly be constructed in time. Another more likely reason for the mass resignations was that on April 22, 1963, the federal Liberal government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson took power. This meant that former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservative government appointees to the board of directors of the Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition were likely forced to resign.Berton, p. 262 Canadian diplomat Pierre Dupuy was named Commissioner General, after Diefenbaker appointee Paul Bienvenu resigned from the post in 1963.Berton, p. 263 One of the main responsibilities of the Commissioner General was to attract other nations to build pavilions at Expo. Dupuy would spend most of 1964 and 1965 soliciting 125 countries, spending more time abroad than in Canada.Berton, p. 264 Dupuy's 'right-hand' man was Robert Fletcher Shaw, the deputy commissioner general and vice-president of the corporation. He also replaced a Diefenbaker appointee, C.F. Carsley, Deputy Commissioner General. Shaw was a professional engineer and builder, and is widely credited for the total building of the Exhibition. Dupuy hired Andrew Kniewasser as the general manager. The management group became known as Les Durs‚Äîthe tough guys‚Äîand they were in charge of creating, building and managing Expo. Les Durs consisted of: Jean-Claude Delorme, Legal Counsel and Secretary of the Corporation; Dale Rediker, Director of Finances; Colonel Edward Churchill, Director of Installations; Philippe de Gasp√© Beaubien, Director of Operations, dubbed \\"The Mayor of Expo\\"; Pierre de Bellefeuille, Director of Exhibitors; and Yves Jasmin, Director of Information, Advertising and Public Relations. To this group the chief architect √âdouard Fiset was added. All ten were honoured by the Canadian government as recipients of the Order of Canada, Companions for Dupuy and Shaw, Officers for the others. Jasmin wrote a book, in French, La petite histoire d'Expo 67, about his 45-month experience at Expo and created the Expo 67 Foundation (available on the web site under that name) to commemorate the event for future generations. As historian Pierre Berton put it, the cooperation between Canada's French- and English-speaking communities \\"was the secret of Expo's success‚Äî'the Qu√©b√©cois flair, the English-Canadian pragmatism.'\\"Berton, p. 269 However, Berton also points out that this is an over-simplification of national stereotypes. Arguably Expo did, for a short period anyway, bridge the 'Two Solitudes.'Berton, pp.269-270 =Montebello conference produces theme= In May 1963, a group of prominent Canadian thinkers‚Äîincluding Alan Jarvis, director of the National Gallery of Canada; novelists Hugh MacLennan and Gabrielle Roy; J. Tuzo Wilson, geophysicist; and Claude Robillard, town planner‚Äîmet for three days at the Seigneury Club in Montebello, Quebec.Berton, p. 258 The theme, \\"Man and His World\\", was based on the 1939 book entitled Terre des Hommes (translated as Wind, Sand and Stars) by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. In Roy's introduction to the Expo 67 corporation's book, entitled Terre des Hommes/Man and His World, she elucidates the theme: The organizers also created seventeen theme elements for Man and his World:Roy (1967), Table of contents Habitat 67, a housing complex built for Expo 67 * Du Pont Auditorium of Canada: The philosophy and scientific content of theme exhibits were presented and emphasized in this 372 seat hall.Expo 67 Guidebook, p. 38 * Habitat 67 * Labyrinth * Man and his Health * Man in the Community * Man the Explorer: Man, his Planet and Space; Man and Life; Man and the Oceans; Man and the Polar Regions * Man the Creator: The Gallery of Fine Arts; Contemporary Sculpture; Industrial Design; Photography. * Man the Producer: Resources for Man; Man in Control; Progress. * Man the Provider =Construction begins= Construction started on August 13, 1963, with an elaborate ceremony hosted by Mayor Drapeau on barges anchored in the St. Lawrence River. Ceremonially, construction began when Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson pulled a lever that signalled a front-end loader to dump the first batch of fill to enlarge √éle Sainte-H√©l√®ne, and Quebec premier Jean Lesage spread the fill with a bulldozer. Of the 25 million tons of fill needed to construct the islands, 10-12% was coming from the Montreal Metro's excavations, a public works project that was already under construction before Expo was awarded to Montreal.Berton, pp. 260,262 The remainder of the fill came from quarries on Montreal and the South Shore, however even with that it was insufficient and so bodies of water on both islands were added (lakes and canals) to reduce the amount of fill required. Expo's initial construction period mainly centered on enlarging Saint Helen's Island, creating the artificial island of √éle Notre-Dame and lengthening and enlarging the Mackay Pier which became the Cit√© du Havre. While construction continued, the land rising out of Montreal harbour was not owned by the Expo Corporation yet. After the final mounds of earth completed the islands, the grounds that would hold the fair were officially transferred from the City of Montreal to the corporation on June 20, 1964. This gave Colonel Churchill only 1042 days to have everything built and functioning for opening day. To get Expo built in time, Churchill used the then new project management tool known as the critical path method (CPM). On April 28, 1967, opening day, everything was ready, with one exception: Habitat 67, which was then displayed as a work in progress.Berton, p.297-298 Building and enlarging the islands, along with the new Concorde Bridge built to connect them with the site-specific mass transit system known as the Montreal Expo Express, plus a boat pier, cost more than the Saint Lawrence Seaway project did only five years earlier: this was even before any buildings or infrastructure were constructed. With the initial phase of construction completed, it is easy to see why the budget for the exhibition was going to be larger than anyone expected. In the fall of 1963, Expo's general manager, Andrew Kniewasser, presented the master plan and the preliminary budget of $167 million for construction: it would balloon to over $439 million by 1967. The plan and budget narrowly passed a vote in Pearson's federal cabinet, passing by one vote, and then it was officially submitted on December 23, 1963.Berton, p.261 =Logo= The logo was designed by Montreal artist Julien H√©bert. The basic unit of the logo is an ancient symbol of man. Two of the symbols (pictograms of \\"man\\") are linked as to represent friendship. The icon was repeated in a circular arrangement to represent \\"friendship around the world\\".Expo 67 Guidebook, p. 29 The logotype is lower- case Optima font. It did not enjoy unanimous support from federal politicians, as some of them tried to kill it with a motion in the House of Commons of Canada. =Theme songs= The official Expo 67 theme song was composed by St√©phane Venne and was titled: \\"Hey Friend, Say Friend/Un Jour, Un Jour\\". Complaints were made about the suitability of the song, as its lyrics mentioned neither Montreal nor Expo 67. The song was selected from an international competition with over 2,200 entries from 35 countries. However, the song that most Canadians associate with Expo was written by Bobby Gimby, a veteran commercial jingle writer who composed the popular Centennial tune \\"Ca- na-da\\". Gimby earned the name the \\"Pied Piper of Canada\\".Berton, pp.30‚Äì33 The theme song \\"Something to Sing About\\", used for the Canadian pavilion, had been written for a 1963 television special. The Ontario pavilion also had its own theme song: \\"A Place to Stand, A Place to Grow\\", which has evolved to become an unofficial theme song for the province. =Expo opens= Official opening ceremonies were held on Thursday afternoon, April 27, 1967. The ceremonies were an invitation-only event, held at Place des Nations. Canada's Governor General, Roland Michener, proclaimed the exhibition open after the Expo flame was ignited by Prime Minister Pearson. On hand were over 7,000 media and invited guests including 53 heads of state. Over 1,000 reporters covered the event, broadcast in NTSC Colour, live via satellite, to a worldwide audience of over 700 million viewers and listeners. Expo 67 opened to the public on the morning of Friday, April 28, 1967, with a space age-style countdown. A capacity crowd at Place d'Accueil participated in the atomic clock-controlled countdown that ended when the exhibition opened precisely at 9:30 a.m. EST. An estimated crowd of between 310,000 and 335,000 visitors showed up for opening day, as opposed to the expected crowd of 200,000. The first person through the Expo gates at Place d'Accueil was Al Carter, a 41-year-old jazz drummer from Chicago, who was recognized for his accomplishment by Expo 67's director of operations Philippe de Gasp√© Beaubien. Beaubien presented Carter with a gold watch for his feat.Berton, pp. 272-273 On opening day, there was considerable comment on the uniform of the hostesses from the UK Pavilion.Berton, p. 272 The dresses had been designed to the then-new miniskirt style, popularized a year earlier by Mary Quant. In conjunction with the opening of Expo 67, the Canadian Post Office Department issued a 5¬¢ stamp commemorating the fair, designed by Harvey Thomas Prosser. =Entertainment, Ed Sullivan Show, and VIPs= The Supremes (L to R: Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson, and Diana Ross) performing \\"The Happening\\", broadcast live from Expo 67 on The Ed Sullivan Show on Sunday, May 7, 1967 The World Festival of Art and Entertainment at Expo 67 featured art galleries, opera, ballet and theatre companies, orchestras, jazz groups, famous Canadian pop musicians and other cultural attractions. Many pavilions had music and performance stages, where visitors could find free concerts and shows, including the Ukrainian Shumka Dancers. Most of the featured entertainment took place in the following venues: Place des Arts, Expo Theatre, Place des Nations, La Ronde, and Automotive Stadium. The La Ronde amusement park was always intended to be a lasting legacy of the fair. Most of its rides and booths were permanent. When the Expo fairgrounds closed nightly, at around 10:00 p.m., visitors could still visit La Ronde, which closed at 2:30 a.m. In addition, The Ed Sullivan Show was broadcast live on May 7 and 21 from Expo 67. Stars on the shows included America's The Supremes, Britain's Petula Clark and Australia's The Seekers.Back to the Future, clips from the Ed Sullivan show. Another attraction was the Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo 1967 at the Autostade in Montreal.\\"The Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo\\" The News and Eastern Townships Advocate , June 22, 1967. The fair was visited by many of the most notable people at the time, including Canada's monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, Lyndon B. Johnson, Princess Grace of Monaco, Jacqueline Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Ethiopia's emperor Haile Selassie, Charles de Gaulle, Bing Crosby, Harry Belafonte, Maurice Chevalier, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and Marlene Dietrich. Musicians like Thelonious Monk, Grateful Dead, Tiny Tim, The Tokens and Jefferson Airplane entertained the crowds. =Problems= Despite its successes, there were problems: Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec militants had threatened to disrupt the exhibition, but were inactive during this period. Vietnam war protesters picketed during the opening day, April 28. American President Lyndon B. Johnson's visit became a focus of war protesters. Threats that the Cuba pavilion would be destroyed by anti-Castro forces were not carried out. In June, the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict in the Middle East flared up again in the Six-Day War, which resulted in Kuwait pulling out of the fair in protest to the way Western nations dealt with the war. The president of France, Charles De Gaulle, caused an international incident on July 24 when he addressed thousands at Montreal City Hall by yelling out the now famous words \\"Vive Montr√©al... Vive le Qu√©bec... Vive le Qu√©bec Libre!\\" In September, the most serious problem turned out to be a 30-day transit strike. By the end of July, estimates predicted that Expo would exceed 60 million visitors, but the strike cut deeply into attendance and revenue figures, just as the fair was cruising to its conclusion. Another major problem, beyond the control of Expo's management, was guest accommodation and lodging. Logexpo was created to direct visitors to accommodations in the Montreal area, which usually meant that visitors would stay at the homes of people they were unfamiliar with, rather than traditional hotels or motels. The Montreal populace opened their homes to thousands of guests. Unfortunately for some visitors, they were sometimes sent to less than respectable establishments where operators took full advantage of the tourist trade. Management of Logexpo was refused to Expo and was managed by a Quebec provincial authority. Still, Expo would get most of the blame for directing visitors to these establishments. But overall, a visit to Expo from outside Montreal was still seen as a bargain. =Expo ends= Site map of Expo 67, highlighting 20 of the 90 pavilions Expo 67 closed on Sunday afternoon, October 29, 1967. The fair had been scheduled to close two days earlier, however a two-day extension granted by the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) allowed it to continue over the weekend. On the final day 221,554 visitors added to the more than 50 million (54,991,806https://expo-67.ca/en/the-film/) that attended Expo 67 at a time when Canada's population was only 20 million, setting a per-capita record for World Exhibition attendance that still stands. Starting at 2:00 p.m., Expo Commissioner General Pierre Dupuy officiated over the medal ceremony, in which participating nations and organizations received gold and silver medallions, and over the ceremony in which national flags were lowered in the reverse order to which they had been raised, with Canada's flag lowered first and Nigeria's lowered last. After Prime Minister Pearson doused the Expo flame, Governor General Roland Michener closed Expo at Place des Nations with the mournful spontaneous farewell: \\"It is with great regret that I declare that the Universal and International Exhibition of 1967 has come to an official end.\\" All rides and the minirail were shut down by 3:50 p.m., and the Expo grounds closed at 4:00 p.m., with the last Expo Express train leaving for Place d'Accueil at that time. A fireworks display, that went on for an hour, was Expo's concluding event. Expo performed better financially than expected. Expo was intended to have a deficit, shared between the federal, provincial and municipal levels of government. Significantly better-than-expected attendance revenue reduced the debt to well below the original estimates. The final financial statistics, in 1967 Canadian dollars, were: revenues of $221,239,872, costs of $431,904,683, and a deficit of $210,664,811. Pavilions USSR Pavilion: the Expo 67 Soviet pavilion was disassembled after the fair closed, and moved to Moscow to become the Moscow Pavilion at the All-Russia Exhibition Centre. Ontario, Canada and Western Provinces pavilions Expo 67 featured 90 pavilions representing Man and His World themes, nations, corporations, and industries including the U.S. pavilion, a geodesic dome designed by Buckminster Fuller. Expo 67 also featured the Habitat 67 modular housing complex designed by architect Moshe Safdie, which was later purchased by private individuals and is still occupied. The most popular pavilion was the Soviet Union's exhibit. It attracted about 13 million visitors. Rounding out the top five pavilions, in terms of attendance were: the Canadian Pavilion (11 million visitors), the United States (9 million), France (8.5 million), and Czechoslovakia (8 million).

Legacy Place des Nations as it appeared in 2006 =Man and His World (1968‚Äì1984)= After 1967, the exposition struggled for several summer seasons as a standing collection of international pavilions known as \\"Man and His World\\". However, as attendance declined, the physical condition of the site deteriorated, and less and less of it was open to the public. After the 1971 season, the entire Notre Dame Island site closed and three years later completely rebuilt around the new rowing and canoe sprint (then flatwater canoeing) basin for Montreal's 1976 Summer Olympics. Space for the basin, the boathouses, the changing rooms and other buildings was obtained by demolishing many of the former pavilions and cutting in half the area taken by the artificial lake and the canals. In 1976, a fire destroyed the acrylic outer skin of Buckminster Fuller's dome, and the previous year the Ontario pavilion was lost due to a major fire. With the site falling into disrepair, and several pavilions left abandoned and vandalized, it began to resemble ruins of a futuristic city. In 1980 the Notre Dame Island site was reopened (primarily for the Floralies) making both islands simultaneously accessible again, albeit only for a brief time. Minor thematic exhibitions were held at the Atlantic pavilion and Quebec pavilion at this period. After the 1981 season, the Saint Helen's Island site permanently closed, shutting out the majority of attractions. Man and His World was able to continue in a limited fashion with the small number of pavilions left standing on Notre Dame Island. However, the few remaining original exhibits closed permanently in 1984. =Park and surviving relics= The former Expo 67 American Pavilion became the Montreal Biosph√®re, an environmental museum on Saint Helen's Island. After the Man and His World summer exhibitions were discontinued, with most pavilions and remnants demolished between 1985 and 1987, the former site for Expo 67 on Saint Helen's Island and Notre Dame Island was incorporated into a municipal park run by the city of Montreal. The park, named Parc des √éles, opened in 1992 during Montreal's 350th anniversary In 2000, the park was renamed from Parc des √éles to Parc Jean-Drapeau, after Mayor Jean Drapeau, who had brought the exhibition to Montreal. In 2006, the corporation that runs the park also changed its name from the Soci√©t√© du parc des √éles to the Soci√©t√© du parc Jean-Drapeau. Today very little remains of Expo but two prominent buildings remain in use on the former Expo grounds: the American pavilion's metal-lattice skeleton form its Buckminster Fuller dome, now enclosing an environmental sciences museum called the Montreal Biosphere; and Habitat 67, now a condominium residence. The France and Quebec pavilions, now interconnected, now form the Montreal Casino. Part of the structural remains of the Canadian pavilion survive as La Toundra Hall. It is now a special events and banquet hall, while another part of the pavilion serves as Parc Jean-Drapeau's administration building. (Katimavik's distinctive inverted pyramid and much of the rest of the Canadian pavilion were dismantled during the 1970s). Place des Nations, where the opening and closing ceremonies were held remains, however in an abandoned and deteriorating state. The Jamaican, Tunisian and partial remains of the Korean pavilion (roof only) also survive, as well as the CIBC banking centre. In Cite du Havre the Expo Theatre, Administration and Fine Arts buildings remain. Other remaining structures include sculptures, lampposts and landscaping. The Montreal Metro subway station Berri-UQAM still has an original \\"Man and His World\\" welcome sign with logo above the pedestrian tunnel entrance to the Yellow Line. La Ronde survives, and since 2001 it has been leased to the New York amusement park company Six Flags. The Alcan Aquarium built for the Expo remained in operation for a number of decades until its closure in 1991. The Expo 67 parking lot was converted into Victoria STOLport, an experimental short-take off airport for a brief time in the 1970s. The Olympic basin is used by many local rowing clubs. A beach was built on the shores of the remaining artificial lake. There are many acres of parkland and cycle paths on both Saint Helen's Island and the western tip of Notre Dame Island. The site has been used for a number of events such as a BIE-sponsored international botanical festival, Les floralies. The young trees and shrubs planted for Expo 67 are now mature. The plants introduced during the botanical events have flourished also. Another attraction on today's Notre Dame Island site is the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve race track that is used for the Canadian Grand Prix. The Czechoslovakian pavilion was designed to be disassembled and sold, attracting the interest of the province of Newfoundland, though its bid was not preferred by the Czechoslovakian government at first. On September 5, 1967, Ceskoslovenske Aerolinie Flight 523 crashed during takeoff from Gander International Airport, and many people were saved by the residents of Gander, which may have led to Newfoundland's purchase offer being accepted. It was assembled as the Grand Falls Arts and Culture Centre, now the Gordon Pinsent Centre for the Arts. The government of Newfoundland also purchased the Yugoslavian pavilion, a triangular building that was converted into the Provincial Seamen's Museum in Grand Bank. One of the few Vaporettos (Italian for water bus) that shuttled visitors around the park on \\"Expo Service No. 5\\" survived. After it was decommissioned it ended up in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island in 1971 where it gave harbour tours. It was later moved to Nova Scotia and then New Brunswick. It has subsequently been renovated and returned to Charlottetown. =Expo's lasting effects= In a political and cultural context, Expo 67 was seen as a landmark moment in Canadian history. In 1968, as a salute to the cultural impact the exhibition had on the city, Montreal's Major League baseball team, the Expos (now the Washington Nationals), was named after the event. 1967 was also the year that invited Expo guest Charles De Gaulle, on July 24, addressed thousands at Montreal City Hall by yelling out the now famous words: \\"Vive Montr√©al... Vive le Qu√©bec... Vive le Qu√©bec Libre!\\" De Gaulle was rebutted in Ottawa by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson: \\"Canadians do not need to be liberated, Canada will remain united and will reject any effort to destroy her unity.\\" In the years that followed, the tensions between the English- and French-speaking communities would continue. As an early 21st- century homage to the fair, satirists Bowser and Blue wrote a full-length musical set at Expo 67 called The Paris of America, which ran for six sold-out weeks at Centaur Theatre in Montreal in April and May 2003. Expo 67 was one of the most successful World Exhibitions, and is still regarded fondly by Canadians. In Montreal, 1967 is often referred to as \\"the last good year\\" before economic decline, Quebec sovereignism (seen as negative from a federalist viewpoint), deteriorating infrastructure and political apathy became common.Berton, Book Jacket and pp.358-364 In this way, it has much in common with the 1964‚Äì65 New York World's Fair. In 2007, a new group, Expo 17, was looking to bring a smaller-scale ‚Äî BIE sanctioned ‚Äî exposition to Montreal for Expo 67's 50th anniversary and Canada's sesquicentennial in 2017. Expo 17 hoped a new world's fair would regenerate the spirit of Canada's landmark centennial project. =50th anniversary= Starting in the spring of 2017, as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations for Expo 67, the city of Montreal and the committee in charge of the celebrations of 375th anniversary of the founding of the city put forward a commemoration program including fourteen events. * Between March 17 and October 1, the McCord Museum presented Fashioning Expo 67, an exhibition focused on the fashion and esthetic that was put forward during the Expo. * At the Museum of Contemporary Art, the exhibition In Search of Expo 67 offered nineteen works of art by artists who were born after the 1967 universal exposition. Their work was inspired by Expo 67 and shed a new light and vision on this event. * The Stewart Museum presented Expo 67 ‚Äì a World of Dreams, an immersive multimedia experience inspired by the technological innovations displayed during Expo 67. As part of the exhibition, visitors could experience Expo 67 through virtual reality. * The Centre d'Histoire de Montr√©al put forward Explosion 67 ‚Äì Youth and their World, which presented youth's experience of the Expo 67 and was based on archive material and interviews. * Echo 67 was presented at the Montreal Biosphere starting on April 27. This exhibition presented the environmental legacy of Expo 67. * Outdoors exhibitions and events were presented across downtown Montreal. From September 18 to 30, 2017, the central square of Place des Arts was the site of a multi-screen installation Expo 67 Live, with images of Expo 67 projected onto exterior surfaces of arts complex, some as high as five storeys. The 27-minute work was produced by the National Film Board of Canada and was intended to create an immersive sense of being back at the world's fair, while also evoking the NFB's pioneering multi-screen production at Expo, In the Labyrinth. The installation is directed by and produced by Ren√© Ch√©nier. * In April 2017, the city hall of Montreal offered its visitors an exhibition of photographs taken during Expo 67. * On April 25, the documentary thriller Expo 67 Mission Impossible premiered at the Maisonneuve theatre. It presents the story of the men and women who made Expo 67 a reality and uses archival footage and exclusive interviews with the creators of the 1967 World Fair. The film premiere was part of an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1967 universal exposition.

More severe forms of spanking, such as switching, paddling, belting, caning, whipping, and birching, involve the use of an object instead of a hand. Parents may spank children in response to undesired behavior. Adults more commonly spank boys than girls, both at home and in school. Some countries have outlawed the spanking of children in every setting, including homes, schools, and penal institutions, but most allow it when done by a parent or guardian. Terminology In North America, the word \\"spanking\\" has often been used as a synonym for an official paddling in school,E.g. \\"Corporal punishment ‚Äî spanking or paddling the student ‚Äî may be used as a discipline management technique .... The instrument to be used in administering corporal punishment shall be approved by the principal or designee\\".Texas Association of School Boards ‚Äì Standard Code of Conduct wording. and sometimes even as a euphemism for the formal corporal punishment of adults in an institution.See e.g. Evidence of Colonel G. Headly Basher, Deputy Minister for Reform Institutions, Ontario, Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on Capital and Corporal Punishment and Lotteries, Canada, 1953‚Äì55. In British English, most dictionaries define \\"spanking\\" as being given only with the open hand.Oxford English Dictionary: \\"Spank: To slap or smack (a person, esp. a child) with the open hand.\\" Collins English Dictionary: \\"Spank: To slap or smack with the open hand, esp. on the buttocks.\\" Flagellation was so common in England as punishment that spanking (and caning and whipping) are called \\"the English vice\\". In American English, dictionaries define spanking as being administered with either the open hand or an implement such as a paddle.American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: \\"Spank: To slap on the buttocks with a flat object or with the open hand, as for punishment.\\" Thus, the standard form of corporal punishment in US schools (use of a paddle) is often referred to as a spanking. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, the word \\"smacking\\" is generally used in preference to \\"spanking\\" when describing striking with an open hand, rather than with an implement. Whereas a spanking is invariably administered to the bottom, a \\"smacking\\" is less specific and may refer to slapping the child's hands, arms or legs as well as its bottom.Oxford English Dictionary: \\"Smack: To strike (a person, part of the body, etc.) with the open hand or with something having a flat surface; to slap. Also spec. to chastise (a child) in this manner and fig.\\" In the home Painting by Georg Conrad (1827‚Äì1889) Parents commonly spank their children as a form of corporal punishment in the United States; however, support for this practice appears to be declining amongst U.S. parents. Spanking is typically done with one or more slaps on the child's buttocks with a bare hand, although, not uncommonly, various objects are used to spank children. Historically, adults spank boys more than girls. In the United States, adults commonly spank infants and toddler age children the most. The main reasons parents give for spanking children are to make children more compliant and to promote better behavior, especially to put a stop to children's aggressive behaviors. However, research has shown that spanking (or any other form of corporal punishment) is associated with the opposite effect. When adults physically punish children, the children tend to obey parents less with time and develop more aggressive behaviors, including toward other children. This increase in aggressive behavior appears to reflect the child's perception that hitting is the way to deal with anger and frustration. There are also many adverse physical, mental, and emotional effects correlated with spanking and other forms of corporal punishment, including various physical injuries, increased anxiety, depression, and antisocial behavior. Adults who were spanked during their childhood are more likely to abuse their children and spouse. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) all recommend that no child should be spanked and instead favor the use of effective, healthy forms of discipline. Additionally, the AAP recommends that primary care providers (e.g., pediatricians and family medicine physicians) begin to discuss parents' discipline methods no later than nine months of age and consider initiating such discussions by age 3‚Äì4 months. By eight months of age, 5% of parents report spanking and 5% report starting to spank by age three months. The AAP also recommends that pediatricians discuss effective discipline strategies and counsel parents about the ineffectiveness of spanking and the risks of harmful effects associated with the practice to minimize harm to children and guide parents. Although parents and other advocates of spanking often claim that spanking is necessary to promote child discipline, studies have shown that parents tend to apply physical punishment inconsistently and tend to spank more often when they are angry or under stress. The use of corporal punishment by parents increases the likelihood that children will suffer physical abuse, and most documented cases of physical abuse in Canada and the United States begin as disciplinary spankings. If a child is frequently spanked, this form of corporal punishment tends to become less effective at modifying behavior over time (also known as extinction). In response to decreased effectiveness of spanking, some parents increase the frequency or severity of spanking or use an object. =Alternatives to spanking= Parents may spank less - or not at all - if they have learned effective discipline techniques, since many parents view spanking as a method of last resort to discipline their children. There are many alternatives to spanking and other forms of corporal punishment: *Time-in, increasing, praise, and special time to promote desired behaviors *Time outs to take a break from escalating misbehavior *Positive reinforcement of rewarding desirable behavior with a star, sticker, or treat *Implementing non-physical negative reinforcement in which an unpleasant consequence follows misbehavior, such as taking away a privilege *Ignoring low-level misbehaviors and prioritizing attention on more significant forms of misbehavior *Avoiding the opportunity for the misbehavior to occur and thus the need for corrective discipline. In schools Corporal punishment, usually delivered with an implement (such as a paddle or cane) rather than with the open hand, used to be a common form of school discipline in many countries, but it is now banned in most of the Western World. Corporal punishment, such as caning, remains a common form of discipline in schools in several Asian and African countries, even in countries in which this practice has been deemed illegal such as India and South Africa. In these cultures it is referred to as \\"caning\\" and not \\"spanking.\\" The Supreme Court of the United States in 1977 held that the paddling of school students was not per se unlawful.Ingraham v. Wright, 97, S.Ct. 1401 (1977). However, 31 states have now banned paddling in public schools. It is still common in some schools in the South, and more than 167,000 students were paddled in the 2011-2012 school year in American public schools. Students can be physically punished from kindergarten to the end of high school, meaning that even adults who have reached the age of majority are sometimes spanked by school officials. A number of medical, pediatric or psychological societies have issued statements opposing all forms of corporal punishment in schools, citing such outcomes as poorer academic achievements, increases in antisocial behaviors, injuries to students, and an unwelcoming learning environment. They include the American Medical Association,\\"H-515.995 Corporal Punishment in Schools\\". American Medical Association. the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Psychoanalytic Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the Society for Adolescent Medicine, the American Psychological Association,\\"Corporal Punishment\\". Council Policy Manual. American Psychological Association. 1975. the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Canadian Paediatric Society and the Australian Psychological Society, as well as the United States' National Association of School Psychologists and National Association of Secondary School Principals. Adult spanking Kiss Me Kate, 1953. Men spanking their wives and girlfriends was often seen as an acceptable form of domestic discipline in the early 20th century as a way to correct behavior, maintain male dominance, and enforce gender norms. It was a common trope in American films. In the early 21st century, adherents of a small subculture known as Christian domestic discipline rely on a literalist interpretation of the Bible to justify spanking as a form of punishment of women by their husbands. Critics describe such practices as a form of domestic abuse. Some consider it a simple sexual fetish and an outlet for sadomasochistic desires. Christian conservative radio host Bryan Fischer said to the Huffington Post that it was a \\"horrifying trendbizarre, twisted, unbiblical and un-Christian\\". Ritual spanking traditions An Easter whip (Czech: poml√°zka; Slovak: korb√°ƒç)Spanking of people who have for the first time succeeded in climbing on the top of Mount Triglav (), the highest mountain of Slovenia There are some rituals or traditions which involve spanking. For example, on the first day of the lunar Chinese new year holidays, a week-long 'Spring Festival', the most important festival for Chinese people all over the world, thousands of Chinese visit the Taoist Dong Lung Gong temple in Tungkang to go through the century-old ritual to get rid of bad luck. Men traditionally receive spankings and women get whipped, with the number of strokes to be administered (always lightly) by the temple staff being decided in either case by the god Wang Ye and by burning incense and tossing two pieces of wood, after which all go home happily, believing their luck will improve. On Easter Monday, there is a Slavic tradition of spanking girls and young ladies with woven willow switches (Czech: poml√°zka; Slovak: korb√°ƒç) and dousing them with water. In Slovenia, there is a jocular tradition that anyone who succeeds in climbing to the top of Mount Triglav receives a spanking or birching.

It is one of the few government agencies explicitly authorized by the United States Constitution. The USPS traces its roots to 1775 during the Second Continental Congress, when Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general. The Post Office Department was created in 1792 with the passage of the Postal Service Act. It was elevated to a cabinet-level department in 1872, and was transformed by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 into the United States Postal Service as an independent agency.Postal Reorganization Act, Pub. Law No. 91-375, 84 Stat. 719, at 720 (Aug. 12, 1970), codified at . Since the early 1980s, many direct tax subsidies to the USPS (with the exception of subsidies for costs associated with disabled and overseas voters) have been reduced or eliminated. The USPS, as of 2019, has 469,934 career employees and 136,174 non-career employees. The Postal Service is legally obligated to serve all Americans, regardless of geography, at uniform price and quality. The Post Office has exclusive access to letter boxes marked \\"U.S. Mail\\" and personal letterboxes in the United States, but has to compete against private package delivery services, such as United Parcel Service, FedEx, and Amazon. History On March 18, 1970, postal workers in New York City‚Äîupset over low wages and poor working conditions, and emboldened by the Civil Rights Movement‚Äîorganized a strike against the United States government. The strike initially involved postal workers in only New York City, but it eventually gained support of over 210,000 United States Post Office Department workers across the nation. While the strike ended without any concessions from the Federal government, it did ultimately allow for postal worker unions and the government to negotiate a contract which gave the unions most of what they wanted, as well as the signing of the Postal Reorganization Act by President Richard Nixon on August 12, 1970. The act replaced the cabinet-level Post Office Department with a new federal agency, the United States Postal Service, and took effect on July 1, 1971. Since the 1990s, Republicans have been discussing the idea of privatizing the U.S. Postal Service. The Donald Trump administration proposed turning USPS into \\"a private postal operator\\" as part of a June 2018 governmental reorganization plan, although there was strong bipartisan opposition to the idea in Congress. In 2020, operational policy changes implemented by new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy precipitated the 2020 United States Postal Service crisis. Current operations USPS delivery truck In a 2006 U.S. Supreme Court decision, the Court noted: \\"Each day, according to the Government's submissions here, the United States Postal Service delivers some 660 million pieces of mail to as many as 142 million delivery points.\\"Dolan v. United States Postal Service, . Update: In 2017, the figure for number of delivery points was 157.3 million (See citation name=sizescope2016). As of 2017, the USPS operates 30,825 post offices and locations in the U.S., and delivers 149.5 billion pieces of mail annually. The USPS operates one of the largest civilian vehicle fleets in the world, with an estimated 227,896 vehicles, the majority of which are the easily identified Chevrolet/Grumman LLV (long-life vehicle), and the newer Ford/Utilimaster FFV (flex-fuel vehicle), originally also referred to as the CRV (carrier route vehicle). Made from 1987 to 1994 and with no air conditioning, no airbags, no anti-lock brakes, and lacking space for the large modern volume of e-commerce packages, the Grumman fleet ended its expected lifespan in fiscal year 2017. The replacement process began in 2015, and prototypes have been produced by various bidders, but due to delays as of May 2020, a final contract for replacement trucks has not been awarded.Postal Service Delays Production Contract for New Mail Truck It is by geography and volume the globe's largest postal system, delivering 47% of the world's mail. For every penny increase in the national average price of gasoline, the USPS spends an extra million per year to fuel its fleet. alt= The number of gallons of fuel used in 2009 was 444 million, at a cost of . The fleet is notable in that many of its vehicles are right-hand drive, an arrangement intended to give drivers the easiest access to roadside mailboxes. Some rural letter carriers use personal vehicles. All contractors use personal vehicles. Standard postal-owned vehicles do not have license plates. These vehicles are identified by a seven- digit number displayed on the front and rear. A fleet of post office vehicles at the James Griffith Station in Spring Branch, Houston The Department of Defense and the USPS jointly operate a postal system to deliver mail for the military; this is known as the Army Post Office (for Army and Air Force postal facilities) and the Fleet Post Office (for Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard postal facilities). In February 2013, the Postal Service announced that on Saturdays it would only deliver packages, mail-order medicines, Priority Mail, and Express Mail, effective August 10, 2013. However, this change was reversed by federal law in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. They now deliver packages on Sunday‚Äîonly for Amazon.com ‚Äî meaning that carriers make parcel deliveries seven days a week. During the four weeks preceding Christmas since 2013, packages from all mail classes and senders were delivered on Sunday in some areas. Parcels are also delivered on holidays, with the exception of Thanksgiving and Christmas. The period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is the busiest time of the year for the USPS with the agency delivering an estimated 900 million packages during the period of 2018. In May 2019, the Postal Service announced that it will be releasing a pilot of self-driving trucks to haul mail across the U.S. The 18-wheelers were developed by startup company, TuSimple. The pilot will last two weeks, making five total round trips to cities across the country. In early May 2020, the USPS's board of governors confirmed that Louis DeJoy would be the new postmaster general. Operation and budget United States Postal Service surplus/deficit In 2016, the Postal Service collected $71.5 billion in revenue. =Revenue decline and planned cuts= In 2016, the USPS had its fifth straight annual operating loss, in the amount of $5.6 billion, of which $5.8 billion was the accrual of unpaid mandatory retiree health payments. Declining mail volume First-class mail volume peaked in 2001, declining by 43% as of 2017 due to the increasing use of email and the World Wide Web for correspondence and business transactions. Private courier services, such as FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS), directly compete with USPS for the delivery of urgent letters and packages. Lower volume means lower revenues to support the fixed commitment to deliver to every address once a day, six days a week. According to an official report on November 15, 2012, the U.S. Postal Service lost $15.9 billion its 2012 fiscal year. Internal streamlining and delivery slowdown In response, the USPS has increased productivity each year from 2000 to 2007, through increased automation, route re-optimization, and facility consolidation. Despite these efforts, the organization saw an $8.5 billion budget shortfall in 2010,McElhatton, Jim \\"Postal Service Reports $8 billion in Losses\\" , The Washington Times, November 12, 2010, accessed August 4, 2011. and was losing money at a rate of about $3 billion per quarter in 2011. On December 5, 2011, the USPS announced it would close more than half of its mail processing centers, eliminate 28,000 jobs and reduce overnight delivery of First-Class Mail. This will close down 252 of its 461 processing centers.Postal Service to Delay Cutbacks Until Mid-May, Staving Off Bankruptcy , Fox News. Accessed: 13 December 2011. (At peak mail volume in 2006, the USPS operated 673 facilities.) As of May 2012, the plan was to start the first round of consolidation in summer 2012, pause from September to December, and begin a second round in February 2014; 80% of first-class mail would still be delivered overnight through the end of 2013. New delivery standards were issued in January 2015, and the majority of single-piece (not presorted) first-class mail is now being delivered in two days instead of one. Large commercial mailers can still have first-class mail delivered overnight if delivered directly to a processing center in the early morning, though as of 2014 this represented only 11% of first-class mail. Unsorted first-class mail will continue to be delivered anywhere in the contiguous United States within three days. Post office closures In July 2011, the USPS announced a plan to close about 3,700 small post offices. Various representatives in Congress protested, and the Senate passed a bill that would have kept open all post offices farther than from the next office. In May 2012, the service announced it had modified its plan. Instead, rural post offices would remain open with reduced retail hours (some as little as two hours per day) unless there was a community preference for a different option. In a survey of rural customers, 54% preferred the new plan of retaining rural post offices with reduced hours, 20% preferred the \\"Village Post Office\\" replacement (where a nearby private retail store would provide basic mail services with expanded hours), 15% preferred merger with another Post Office, and 11% preferred expanded rural delivery services. Approximately 40% of postal revenue already comes from online purchases or private retail partners including Walmart, Staples, Office Depot, Walgreens, Sam's Club, Costco, and grocery stores. The National Labor Relations Board agreed to hear the American Postal Workers Union's arguments that these counters should be manned by postal employees who earn far more and have \\"a generous package of health and retirement benefits\\". Elimination of Saturday delivery averted On January 28, 2009, Postmaster General John E. Potter testified before the Senate that, if the Postal Service could not readjust its payment toward the contractually funding earned employee retiree health benefits, as mandated by the Postal Accountability & Enhancement Act of 2006, the USPS would be forced to consider cutting delivery to five days per week during June, July, and August. H.R. 22, addressing this issue, passed the House of Representatives and Senate and was signed into law on September 30, 2009. However, Postmaster General Potter continued to advance plans to eliminate Saturday mail delivery. On June 10, 2009, the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association (NRLCA) was contacted for its input on the USPS's current study of the effect of five-day delivery along with developing an implementation plan for a five-day service plan. A team of Postal Service headquarters executives and staff has been given a time frame of sixty days to complete the study. The current concept examines the effect of five-day delivery with no business or collections on Saturday, with Post Offices with current Saturday hours remaining open. On Thursday, April 15, 2010, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing to examine the status of the Postal Service and recent reports on short and long-term strategies for the financial viability and stability of the USPS entitled \\"Continuing to Deliver: An Examination of the Postal Service's Current Financial Crisis and its Future Viability\\". At which, PMG Potter testified that by the year 2020, the USPS cumulative losses could exceed $238 billion, and that mail volume could drop 15 percent from 2009. In February 2013, the USPS announced that in order to save about $2 billion per year, Saturday delivery service would be discontinued except for packages, mail-order medicines, Priority Mail, Express Mail, and mail delivered to Post Office boxes, beginning August 10, 2013. However, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013, passed in March, reversed the cuts to Saturday delivery. =Retirement funding and payment defaults= The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA) obligates the USPS to fund the present value of earned retirement obligations (essentially past promises which have not yet come due) within a ten-year time span. In contrast, private businesses in the United States have no legal obligation to pay for retirement costs at promise-time rather than retirement-time, but about one quarter do. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is the main bureaucratic organization responsible for the human resources aspect of many federal agencies and their employees. The PAEA created the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefit Fund (PSRHB) after Congress removed the Postal Service contribution to the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). Most other employees that contribute to the CSRS have 7% deducted from their wages. Currently all new employees contribute into Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) once they become a full-time regular employees. On September 30, 2014, the USPS failed to make a $5.7 billion payment on this debt, the fourth such default. On February 5, 2020, the House passed The USPS Fairness Act (H.R. 2382) with 309 Yeas and 106 Nays meeting the 2/3rd rule. The measure eliminates the requirement going forward and forgives all payments on which USPS has defaulted. It was moved to the Senate on February 10, 2020 and is awaiting action by senators. =Rate increases= Congress has limited rate increases for First-Class Mail to the cost of inflation, unless approved by the Postal Regulatory Commission. A three-cent surcharge above inflation increased the rate to 49¬¢ in January 2014, but this was approved by the commission for two years only. As of January 2019, first-class postage for up to 1 ounce is $0.55. =Reform proposals and delivery changes= Comprehensive reform packages considered in the 113th Congress include S.1486 and H.R.2748. These include the efficiency measure, supported by Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe of ending door-to- door delivery of mail for some or most of the 35 million addresses that currently receive it, replacing that with either curbside boxes or nearby \\"cluster boxes\\". This would save $4.5 billion per year out of the $30 billion delivery budget; door-to-door city delivery costs annually on average $353 per stop, curbside $224, and cluster box $160 (and for rural delivery, $278, $176, and $126, respectively). S.1486, also with the support of Postmaster Donahoe, would also allow the USPS to ship alcohol in compliance with state law, from manufacturers to recipients with ID to show they are over 21. This is projected to raise approximately $50 million per year. (Shipping alcoholic beverages is currently illegal under (f).) In 2014, the Postal Service was requesting reforms to workers' compensation, moving from a pension to defined contribution retirement savings plan, and paying senior retiree health care costs out of Medicare funds, as is done for private-sector workers. As part of a June 2018 governmental reorganization plan, the Donald Trump administration proposed turning USPS into \\"a private postal operator\\" which could save costs through measures like delivering mail fewer days per week, or delivering to central locations instead of door to door. There was strong bipartisan opposition to the idea in Congress. In April 2020 Congress approved a $10 billion loan from the Treasury to the post office. According to the Washington Post, officials under Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggested using the loan as leverage to give the Treasury Department more influence on USPS operations, including making them raise their charges for package deliveries, a change long sought by President Trump. In May 2020 Louis DeJoy was appointed Postmaster General and immediately began taking measures to reduce costs, such as banning overtime and extra trips to deliver mail. While DeJoy admitted that these measures were causing delays in mail delivery, he said they would eventually improve service. More than 600 high-speed mail sorting machines were scheduled to be dismantled and removed from postal facilities, raising concerns that mailed ballots for the November 3 election might not reach election offices on time. Mail collection boxes were removed from the streets in many cities; after photos of boxes being removed were spread on social media, a postal service spokesman said they were being moved to higher traffic areas but that the removals would stop until after the election. The inspector general for the postal service opened an investigation into the recent changes. On August 16 the House of Representatives was called back from its summer recess to consider a bill rolling back all of the changes. On August 18 - after days of heavy criticism, and the day after lawsuits against the Postal Service and DeJoy personally were filed in federal court by several individuals  DeJoy announced that he would roll back all the changes until after the November election. He said he would reinstate overtime hours, roll back service reductions, and halt the removal of mail-sorting machines and collection boxes. However, 95 percent of the mail sorting machines that were planned for removal have already been removed, and according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, DeJoy said he has no intention of replacing them or the mail collection boxes. =Coronavirus pandemic and voting by mail= Voting by mail has become an increasingly common practice in the United States, with 25% of voters nationwide mailing their ballots in 2016 and 2018. The coronavirus pandemic of 2020 has been predicted to cause a large increase in mail voting because of the possible danger of congregating at polling places. For the 2020 election, a state-by-state analysis concluded that 76% of Americans are eligible to vote by mail in 2020, a record number. The analysis predicted that 80 million ballots could be cast by mail in 2020 - more than double the number in 2016. The Postal Service sent a letter to 46 states in July 2020, warning that the service might not be able to meet the state's deadlines for requesting and casting last-minute absentee ballots. The House of Representatives voted to include an emergency grant of $25 billion to the post office to facilitate the predicted flood of mail ballots. Trump conceded that the post office would need additional funds to handle the additional mail-in voting, but said he would oppose any additional funding so that \\"universal mail-in voting\\" would not be possible. On August 14, 2020, President Trump says he's willing to approve USPS funding if concessions are made to some funding asks in coronavirus relief package. Governance and organization The Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service sets policy, procedure, and postal rates for services rendered. It has a similar role to a corporate board of directors. Of the eleven members of the Board, nine are appointed by the president and confirmed by the United States Senate (see ). The nine appointed members then select the United States postmaster general, who serves as the board's tenth member, and who oversees the day-to-day activities of the service as chief executive officer (see ). The ten-member board then nominates a deputy postmaster general, who acts as chief operating officer, to the eleventh and last remaining open seat. The independent Postal Regulatory Commission (formerly the Postal Rate Commission) is also controlled by appointees of the president confirmed by the Senate. It oversees postal rates and related concerns, having the authority to approve or reject USPS proposals. The USPS is often mistaken for a state-owned enterprise or government-owned corporation (e.g., Amtrak) because it operates much like a business. It is, however, an \\"establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States\\", () as it is controlled by presidential appointees and the postmaster general. As a government agency, it has many special privileges, including sovereign immunity, eminent domain powers, powers to negotiate postal treaties with foreign nations, and an exclusive legal right to deliver first-class and third-class mail. Indeed, in 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision ‚ÄúThe Postal Service is not subject to antitrust liability.

Retrieved November 9, 2019. On June 21, 2018, Trump proposed a sweeping government reorganization that would sharpen the focus on workforce training, consolidate government-assistance programs and shrink federal agencies. As part of this proposal, he recommended restructuring the postal service with an eye toward privatization. According to his proposal, privatization would cut costs and give the financially burdened agency greater flexibility in adjusting to the digital age. Lisa Graves documented decades-long efforts to privatize the U.S. Postal Service through driving the public service to financial collapse in her brief that was published by ITPI, In The Public Interest.Graves, Lisa, The Billionaire Behind Efforts to Kill the U.S. Postal Service, In The Public Interest, July, 2020ITPI - In The Public Interest Moyers, Bill, Bill Moyers Talks with Lisa Graves about the Ongoing Threat to the US Postal Service, Moyers on Democracy, August 19, 2020 Universal service obligation and monopoly status =Legal basis and rationale= Article I, section 8, Clause 7 of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to establish post offices and post roads, which has been interpreted as a de facto Congressional monopoly over the delivery of first- class residential mail‚Äîwhich has been defined as non-urgent residential letters (not packages). Accordingly, no other system for delivering first- class residential mail‚Äîpublic or private‚Äîhas been tolerated, absent Congress's consent. The mission of the Postal Service is to provide the American public with trusted universal postal service. While not explicitly defined, the Postal Service's universal service obligation (USO) is broadly outlined in statute and includes multiple dimensions: geographic scope, range of products, access to services and facilities, delivery frequency, affordable and uniform pricing, service quality, and security of the mail. While other carriers may claim to voluntarily provide delivery on a broad basis, the Postal Service is the only carrier with a legal obligation to provide all the various aspects of universal service. Proponents of universal service principles claim that since any obligation must be matched by the financial capability to meet that obligation, the postal monopoly was put in place as a funding mechanism for the USO, and it has been in place for over a hundred years. It consists of two parts: the Private Express Statutes (PES) and the mailbox access rule. The PES refer to the Postal Service's monopoly on the delivery of letters, and the mailbox rule refers to the Postal Service's exclusive access to customer mailboxes. Proponents of universal service principles further claim that eliminating or reducing the PES or mailbox rule would affect the ability of the Postal Service to provide affordable universal service. If, for example, the PES and the mailbox rule were to be eliminated, and the USO maintained, then either billions of dollars in tax revenues or some other source of funding would have to be found. Some proponents of universal service principles suggest that private communications that are protected by the veil of government promote the exchange of free ideas and communications. This separates private communications from the ability of a private for-profit or non-profit organization to corrupt. Security for the individual is in this way protected by the United States Post Office, maintaining confidentiality and anonymity, as well as government employees being much less likely to be instructed by superiors to engage in nefarious spying. It is seen by some as a dangerous step to extract the universal service principle from the post office, as the untainted nature of private communications is preserved as assurance of the protection of individual freedom of privacy. However, as the recent notice of a termination of mail service to residents of the Frank Church‚ÄîRiver of No Return Wilderness indicates, mail service has been contracted to private firms such as Arnold Aviation for many decades. KTVB-TV reported:Postal Service to renew Idaho back country mail route Alyson Outen, KTVB-TV, April 10, 2009 =2008 report on universal postal service and the postal monopoly= The Postal Act of 2006 required the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) to submit a report to the president and Congress on universal postal service and the postal monopoly in December 2008. The report must include any recommended changes. The Postal Service report supports the requirement that the PRC is to consult with and solicit written comments from the Postal Service. In addition, the Government Accountability Office is required to evaluate broader business model issues by 2011. On October 15, 2008, the Postal Service submitted a reportUSPS.com . USPS.com (November 26, 2008). Retrieved on July 8, 2011. to the PRC on its position related to the Universal Service Obligation (USO). It said no changes to the USO and restriction on mailbox access were necessary at this time, but increased regulatory flexibility was required to ensure affordable universal service in the future. In 2013, the Postal Service announced that starting August 2013, Saturday delivery would be discontinued. Obligations of the USO include uniform prices, quality of service, access to services, and six-day delivery to every part of the country. To assure financial support for these obligations, the postal monopoly provides the Postal Service the exclusive right to deliver letters and restricts mailbox access solely for mail. The report argued that eliminating or reducing either aspect of the monopoly \\"would have a devastating impact on the ability ... to provide the affordable universal service that the country values so highly\\". Relaxing access to the mailbox would also pose security concerns, increase delivery costs, and hurt customer service, according to the Post Office. The report notes: > It is somewhat misleading to characterize the mailbox rule as a \\"monopoly,\\" > because the enforcement of leaves customers with ample alternative means of > delivering their messages. Customers can deliver their messages either by > paying postage, by placing messages on or under a door or a doormat, by > using newspaper or non-postal boxes, by telephoning or emailing, by engaging > in person-to-person delivery in public areas, by tacking or taping their > notices on a door post, or by placing advertisements in local newspapers. > These methods are comparable in efficacy to communication via the mailbox. Most of these alternatives are not actually free in some communities. For example, in the Chicago metropolitan area and many other major metros one must get a background check from police and pay a daily fee for the right to solicit or post commercial messages on private property. Regarding the monopoly on delivery of letters, the report notes that the monopoly is not complete, as there is an exception for letters where either the amount paid for private carriage of the letter equals at least six times the current rate for the first ounce of a single-piece First-Class Mail letter (also known as the \\"base rate\\" or \\"base tariff\\") or the letter weighs at least 12.5 ounces. The Postal Service said that the USO should continue to be broadly defined and there should be no changes to the postal monopoly. Any changes would have far- reaching effects on customers and the trillion dollar mailing industry. \\"A more rigidly defined USO would ... ultimately harm the American public and businesses,\\" according to the report, which cautions that any potential change must be studied carefully and the effects fully understood. =Competitors= USPS Terminal Annex building in Los Angeles FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS) directly compete with USPS Express Mail and package delivery services, making nationwide deliveries of urgent letters and packages. Due to the postal monopoly, they are not allowed to deliver non-urgent letters and may not directly ship to U.S. Mail boxes at residential and commercial destinations. However, both companies have transit agreements with the USPS in which an item can be dropped off with either FedEx or UPS who will then provide shipment up to the destination post office serving the intended recipient where it will be transferred for delivery to the U.S. Mail destination, including Post Office Box destinations. These services also deliver packages which are larger and heavier than USPS will accept. DHL Express was the third major competitor until February 2009, when it ceased domestic delivery operations in the United States. A variety of other transportation companies in the United States move cargo around the country, but either have limited geographic scope for delivery points, or specialize in items too large to be mailed. Many of the thousands of courier companies focus on same-day delivery, for example, by bicycle messenger. Although USPS and FedEx are direct competitors, USPS contracts with FedEx for air transport of 2‚Äì3 Day Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express (typically delivered overnight). =Alternative transmission methods= The Post Office Department owned and operated the first public telegraph lines in the United States, starting in 1844 from Washington to Baltimore, and eventually extending to New York, Boston, Buffalo, and Philadelphia. In 1847, the telegraph system was privatized, except for a period during World War I, when it was used to accelerate the delivery of letters arriving at night. Between 1942 and 1945, \\"V-Mail\\" (for \\"Victory Mail\\") service was available for military mail. Letters were converted into microfilm and reprinted near the destination, to save room on transport vehicles for military cargo. In 1970, Western Union in co-operation with the Postal Service introduced the \\"Mailgram\\", a special type of telegram offered by Western Union intended for bulk mailing to multiple addressees. The sender would contact WU and submit to them the message to be sent and a list of addressees to mail the requested Mailgrams to. The message and address data were then sent electronically over Western Union's terrestrial network normally used for standard telegrams, with WU's Westar 1 satellite used instead starting in 1974 with its launch, for Mailgram transmission to participating Postal Service centers, who would then print and mail the Mailgrams to the requested addressees. Similar to WU's Mailgrams was Electronic Computer Originated Mail, offered by the Postal Service from 1982 to 1985. Also known as E-COM, it too was used for bulk mailings. Text was transmitted electronically to one of 25 post offices nationwide. The Postal Service would print the mail and put it in special envelopes bearing a blue E-COM logo. Delivery was assured within 2 days. To improve accuracy and efficiency, the Postal Service introduced the Intelligent Mail program to complement the ZIP code system. This system, which was intended to replace the deprecated POSTNET system, allows bulk mailers to use pre-printed bar codes to assist in mail delivery and sorting. Additional features, called Enhanced, or Full-Service, Intelligent Mail Barcodes allow for mail tracking of bulk mail through the postal system up to the final delivery Post Office. =Criticism of the universal service requirement and the postal monopoly= Critics of the universal service requirement and the statutory postal monopoly include several professional economists advocating for the privatization of the mail delivery system, or at least a relaxation of the universal service model that currently exists.Geddes, Rick. \\"Do Vital Economists Reach a Policy Conclusion on Postal Reform?\\" (April 2004). econjournalwatch.org Rick Geddes argued in 2000: Furthermore, some economists have argued that because public enterprises may pursue objectives different than profit maximization, they might have more of an incentive than profit-maximizing firms to behave anticompetitively through policies such as predatory pricing, misstating costs, and creating barriers to entry. To resolve those issues, one economist proposes a cost- allocation model that would determine the optimal allocation of USPS's common costs by finding the share of costs that would maximize USPS profits from its competitive products. Postal regulators could use such a cost model to ensure that the Postal Service is not abusing its statutory monopoly by subsidizing price cuts in competitive product markets with revenue obtained from the monopolized market.Id. Law enforcement agencies Under the Mail Cover Program USPS photographs the front and back of every piece of U.S. mail as part of the sorting process, enabling law enforcement to obtain address information and images of the outsides of mail as part of an investigation without the need for a warrant.Melendez, Steven (October 25, 2018.) \\"Suspicious Packages Spotlight Vast Postal Surveillance System.\\" Fast Company. Retrieved November 9, 2019. The Food and Drug Administration inspects packages for illegal drug shipments =Postal Inspection Service= The United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) is one of the oldest law enforcement agencies in the U.S. Founded by Benjamin Franklin on August 7, 1775, its mission is to protect the Postal Service, its employees, and its customers from crime and protect the nation's mail system from criminal misuse. Postal Inspectors enforce over 200 federal laws providing for the protection of mail in investigations of crimes that may adversely affect or fraudulently use the U.S. Mail, the postal system or postal employees. The USPIS has the power to enforce the USPS monopoly by conducting search and seizure raids on entities they suspect of sending non-urgent mail through overnight delivery competitors. According to the American Enterprise Institute, a private conservative think tank, the USPIS raided Equifax offices in 1993 to ascertain if the mail they were sending through Federal Express was truly \\"extremely urgent\\". It was found that the mail was not, and Equifax was fined $30,000. The PIS oversees the activities of the Postal Police Force who patrol and secure major postal facilities in the United States. =Office of Inspector General= The United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) was authorized by law in 1996. Prior to the 1996 legislation, the Postal Inspection Service performed the duties of the OIG. The inspector general, who is independent of postal management, is appointed by and reports directly to the nine presidentially appointed, Senate‚Äìconfirmed members of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service. The primary purpose of the OIG is to prevent, detect and report fraud, waste and program abuse, and promote efficiency in the operations of the Postal Service.

The discontinuation of international surface mail =Sorting and delivery process= Mail flow through national infrastructure Processing of standard sized envelopes and cards is highly automated, including reading of handwritten addresses. Mail from individual customers and public postboxes is collected by letter carriers into plastic tubs, which are taken to one of approximately 251 Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DC;) across the United States. Each P&DC; sorts mail for a given region (typically with a radius of around ) and connects with the national network for interregional mail.Author unknown (date unknown). Direct Marketing Direct Mail. Allbusiness.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-08 from . The USPS has consolidated mail sorting for large regions into the P&DCs; on the basis that most mail is addressed to faraway destinations, but for cities at the edge of a P&DC;'s region, this means all locally addressed mail must now travel long distances (that is, to and from the P&DC; for sorting) to reach nearby addresses. At the P&DC;, mail is emptied into hampers which are then automatically dumped into a Dual Pass Rough Cull System (DPRCS). As mail travels through the DPRCS, large items, such as packages and mail bundles, are removed from the stream. As the remaining mail enters the first machine for processing standard mail, the Advanced Facer-Canceler System (AFCS), pieces that passed through the DPRCS but do not conform to physical dimensions for processing in the AFCS (e.g., large envelopes or overstuffed standard envelopes) are automatically diverted from the stream. Mail removed from the DPRCS and AFCS is manually processed or sent to parcel sorting machines. In contrast to the previous system, which merely canceled and postmarked the upper right corner of the envelope, thereby missing any stamps which were inappropriately placed, the Advanced Facer- Canceler System locates indicia (stamp or metered postage mark), regardless of the orientation of the mail as it enters the machine, and cancels it by applying a postmark. Detection of indicia enables the AFCS to determine the orientation of each mailpiece and sort it accordingly, rotating pieces as necessary so all mail is sorted right-side up and faced in the same direction in each output bin. Mail is output by the machine into three categories: mail already affixed with a bar code and addressed (such as business reply envelopes and cards); mail with machine printed (typed) addresses; and mail with handwritten addresses. Additionally, machines with a recent Optical Character Recognition (OCR) upgrade have the capability to read the address information, including handwritten, and sort the mail based on local or outgoing ZIP codes. Mail with typed addresses goes to a Multiline Optical Character Reader (MLOCR) which reads the ZIP Code and address information and prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelope. Mail (actually the scanned image of the mail) with handwritten addresses (and machine-printed ones that are not easily recognized) goes to the Remote Bar Coding System. It also corrects spelling errors and, where there is an error, omission, or conflict in the written address, identifies the most likely correct address. When it has decided on a correct address, it prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelopes, similarly to the MLOCR system. RBCS also has facilities in place, called Remote Encoding Centers, that have humans look at images of mail pieces and enter the address data. The address data is associated with the image via an ID Tag, a fluorescent barcode printed by mail processing equipment on the back of mail pieces. Processed mail is imaged by the Mail Isolation Control and Tracking (MICT) system to allow easier tracking of hazardous substances. Images are taken at more than 200 mail processing centers, and are destroyed after being retained for 30 days. If a customer has filed a change of address card and his or her mail is detected in the mailstream with the old address, the mailpiece is sent to a machine that automatically connects to a Computerized Forwarding System database to determine the new address. If this address is found, the machine will paste a label over the former address with the current address. The mail is returned to the mailstream to forward to the new location. Mail with addresses that cannot be resolved by the automated system are separated for human intervention. If a local postal worker can read the address, he or she manually sorts it out according to the ZIP code on the article. If the address cannot be read, mail is either returned to the sender (First-Class Mail with a valid return address) or is sent to the Mail Recovery Center in Atlanta, Georgia (formerly known as the dead letter office). At this office, the mail is opened to try to find an address to forward to. If an address is found, the contents are resealed and delivered. Otherwise, the items are held for 90 days in case of inquiry by the customer; if they are not claimed, they are either destroyed or auctioned off at the monthly Postal Service Unclaimed Parcel auction to raise money for the service. Once the mail is bar coded, it is automatically sorted by a Delivery Bar Code Sorter (DBCS) that reads the bar code, identifies the destination of the mailpiece, and sends it to an appropriate tray that corresponds to the next segment of its journey. Regional mail is either trucked to the appropriate local post office, or kept in the building for carrier routes served directly from the P&DC.; Out-of-region mail is trucked to the airport and then flown, usually as baggage on commercial airlines, to the airport nearest the destination station. At the destination P&DC;, mail is once again read by a DBCS which sorts items to local post offices; this includes grouping mailpieces by individual letter-carrier route. At the carrier route level, 95% of letters arrive pre-sorted; the remaining mail must be sorted by hand. The Post Office is working to increase the percentage of automatically sorted mail, including a pilot program to sort \\"flats\\".USPS.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-08 from .

Types of postal facilities Historic main post office in Tomah, Wisconsin Spring Branch area of Houston, Texas Post Office, Customs House, and Federal Court House in Galveston, Texas Floating post office, Halibut Cove, Alaska Although its customer service centers are called post offices in regular speech, the USPS recognizes several types of postal facilities, including the following: * A main post office (formerly known as a general post office) is the primary postal facility in a community. * A station or post office station is a postal facility that is not the main post office, but that is within the corporate limits of the community. * A branch or post office branch is a postal facility that is not the main post office and that is outside the corporate limits of the community. * A classified unit is a station or branch operated by USPS employees in a facility owned or leased by the USPS. * A contract postal unit (or CPU) is a station or branch operated by a contractor, typically in a store or other place of business. * A community post office (or CPO) is a contract postal unit providing services in a small community in which other types of post office facilities have been discontinued. * A finance unit is a station or branch that provides window services and accepts mail, but does not provide delivery. * A village post office (VPO) is an entity such as a local business or government center that provides postal services through a contract with the USPS. First introduced in 2011 as an integral part of the USPS plan to close low volume post offices, village post offices will fill the role of the post office within a ZIP code. * A processing and distribution center (P&DC;, or processing and distribution facility, formerly known as a General Mail Facility) is a central mail facility that processes and dispatches incoming and outgoing mail to and from a designated service area (251 nationwide). * A sectional center facility (SCF) is a P&DC; for a designated geographical area defined by one or more three-digit ZIP code prefixes. * An international service center (ISC) is an international mail processing facility. There are only five such USPS facilities in the continental United States, located in Chicago, New York, Miami, Los Angeles and San Francisco. * A network distribution center, formerly known as a bulk mail center (BMC), is a central mail facility that processes bulk rate parcels as the hub in a hub and spoke network. * An auxiliary sorting facility (ASF) is a central mail facility that processes bulk rate parcels as spokes in a hub and spoke network. * A remote encoding center (REC) is a facility at which clerks receive images of problem mail pieces (those with hard-to-read addresses, etc.) via secure Internet-type feeds and manually type the addresses they can decipher, using a special encoding protocol. The mail pieces are then sprayed with the correct addresses or are sorted for further handling according to the instructions given via encoding. The total number of RECs is down from 55 in 1998 to just 1 center in December 2016. The last REC is in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Evolutionary Network Development (END) program In February 2006, the USPS announced that they plan to replace the nine existing facility-types with five processing facility-types: * Regional Distribution Centers (RDCs), which will process all classes of parcels and bundles and serve as Surface Transfer Centers; * Local Processing Centers (LPCs), which will process single-piece letters and flats and cancel mail; * Destination Processing Centers (DPC), sort the mail for individual letter-carrier route; * Airport Transfer Centers (ATCs), which will serve as transfer points only; and * Remote Encoding Centers (RECs). Over a period of years, these facilities are expected to replace Processing & Distribution Centers, Customer Service Facilities, Bulk Mail Centers, Logistic and Distribution Centers, annexes, the Hub and Spoke Program, Air Mail Centers, and International Service Centers. The changes are a result of the declining volumes of single-piece First-Class Mail, population shifts, the increase in drop shipments by advertising mailers at destinating postal facilities, advancements in equipment and technology, redundancies in the existing network, and the need for operational flexibility. The program was ended in early 2007 after an analysis revealed that the significant amount of capital investment required to implement the END network concept would not generate the benefits originally anticipated.

(See the section Revenue decline and planned cuts.) Direct delivery vs. customer pickup Originally, mail was not delivered to homes and businesses, but to post offices. In 1863, \\"city delivery\\" began in urban areas with enough customers to make this economical. This required streets to be named, houses to be numbered, with sidewalks and lighting provided, and these street addresses to be added to envelopes. The number of routes served expanded over time. In 1891, the first experiments with Rural Free Delivery began in less densely populated areas. There is currently an effort to reduce direct delivery in favor of mailbox clusters. To compensate for high mail volume and slow long-distance transportation which saw mail arrive at post offices throughout the day, deliveries were made multiple times a day. This ranged from twice for residential areas to up to seven times for the central business district of Brooklyn, New York.Deliveries per Day . (PDF) . Retrieved on July 8, 2011. In the late 19th century, mail boxes were encouraged, saving carriers the time it took to deliver directly to the addressee in person; in the 1910s and 1920s, they were phased in as a requirement for service. In the 1940s, multiple daily deliveries began to be reduced, especially on Saturdays. By 1990, the last twice-daily deliveries in New York City were eliminated. Today, mail is delivered once a day on-site to most private homes and businesses.

Labor unions representing USPS employees include: The American Postal Workers Union (APWU), which represents postal clerks and maintenance, motor vehicle, mail equipment shops, material distribution centers, and operating services and facilities services employees, postal nurses, and IT and accounting;Collective Bargaining Agreement between APWU and USPS the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC), which represents city letter carriers; the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association (NRLCA), which represents rural letter carriers; and the National Postal Mail Handlers Union (NPMHU). USPS employees are divided into major crafts according to the work they engage in: * Letter carriers, also referred to as mailmen or mail carriers, prepare and deliver mail and parcels. They are divided into two categories: City Letter Carriers, who are represented by the NALC, and Rural Letter Carriers, who are represented by the NRLCA. City Carriers are paid hourly with automatic overtime paid after 8 hours or 40 hours a week of duty. City Carriers are required to work in any kind of weather, daylight or dark and carry three bundles of mail (letters in one hand with magazines and other larger mail pieces) on the forearm carrying the mail. Advertisement mail, Every door direct (EDD) and smaller parcels all go in the carriers satchel). Larger parcels, up to a total of 70 lbs. may be delivered at various times of the day or with the mail. Mail routes are outfitted with a number of scanpoints (mailbox barcodes) on random streets every 30 to 40 minutes apart to keep track of the carriers whereabouts in real-time. * Rural carriers are under a form of salary called \\"evaluated hours\\", usually with overtime built into their pay. The evaluated hours are created by having all mail counted for a period of two or four weeks, and a formula used to create the set dollar amount they will be paid for each day worked until the next time the route is counted. * Mail handlers and processors, prepare, separate, load and unload mail and parcels, by delivery ZIP code and station, for the clerks. They work almost exclusively at the plants or larger mail facilities now after having their duties excessed and reassigned to clerks in Post Offices and Station branches. * Clerks, have a dual function by design of where their assignment is. Window clerks directly handle customer service needs at the counter, sort box mail and also sort first-class letters, standard and bulk-rate mail for the carriers on the work floor. Clerks may also work alongside mail handlers in large sorting facilities, outside of the public view, sorting mail. Data Conversion Operators, who encode address information at Remote Encoding Centers, are also members of the clerk craft. Mail handlers and Clerks are represented by the NPMHU and the APWU, respectively. Other non-managerial positions in the USPS include: * Maintenance and custodians, who see to the overall operation and cleaning of mail sorting machines, work areas, public parking and general facility operations. * City Carrier Assistants. (CCAs) With the Das Arbitration award the designation of PTF City Carrier has been abolished. TE City Carriers will have the opportunity to become CCAs. A CCA is a non-career employee who is hired for a 360-day term, similar to what TEs had. CCAs earn annual leave. CCAs, unlike TEs do have a direct path to becoming career employees. When excess City Carrier positions exist the CCA in that work installation with the highest \\"relative standing\\" will be promoted to a career employee and be assigned to the vacant position. * Career, Part Time Flexible and Transitional employees (Career, PTF & TE) There are a variety of other non-managerial positions in such crafts as accounting, information technology, and the remote encoding center. These are under a different contract than plant workers or letter carriers. *Contractors are not USPS employees, but work for the USPS under a written contract and usually paid per mile. They do not get benefits including health insurance, leave, life insurance, and pension. They must use their own vehicle and pay any cost to maintain, insure, or replace. Contractors generally make less than employees. Just like regular carriers they deliver packages and letters to mailboxes and doors. Though the USPS employs many individuals, as more Americans send information via email, fewer postal workers are needed to work dwindling amounts of mail. Post offices and mail facilities are constantly downsizing, replacing craft positions with new machines and consolidating mail routes through the MIARAP (Modified Interim Alternate Route Adjustment Process) agreement. A major round of job cuts, early retirements, and a construction freeze were announced on March 20, 2009. =Workplace violence= In the early 1990s, widely publicized workplace shootings by disgruntled employees at USPS facilities led to a Human Resource effort to provide care for stressed workers and resources for coworker conflicts. Due to media coverage, postal employees gained a reputation among the general public as more likely to be mentally ill. The USPS Commission on a Safe and Secure Workplace found that \\"Postal workers are only a third as likely as those in the national workforce to be victims of homicide at work.\\"USPS Commission on a Safe and Secure Workplace, January 31, 2006 .

The series of massacres led the USPS to issue a rule prohibiting the possession of any type of firearms (except for those issued to Postal Inspectors) in all designated USPS facilities. In 2016, video footage was released showing a group of police officers from the New York City Police Department (NYPD) arresting a USPS worker while he was in the middle of his deliveries.

In fiction * In the film Miracle on 34th Street (1947), the identity of Kris Kringle (played by Edmund Gwenn) as the one and only \\"Santa Claus\\" was validated by a state court, based on the delivery of 21 bags of mail (famously carried into the courtroom) to the character in question. The contention was that it would have been illegal for the United States Post Office to deliver mail that was addressed to \\"Santa Claus\\" to the character \\"Kris Kringle\\" unless he were, in fact, the one and only Santa Claus. Judge Henry X. Harper (played by Gene Lockhart) ruled that since the U.S. Government had demonstrated through the delivery of the bags of mail that Kris Kringle was Santa Claus, the State of New York did not have the authority to overrule that decision. * The novel Post Office (1971), written by poet and novelist Charles Bukowski, is a semi-autobiographical account of his life over the years as a letter carrier. Bukowski would, under duress, quit and years later return as a mail clerk. His personal account would detail the work at lengths as frustrating, menial, boring, and degrading. * David Brin's novel The Postman (1985) portrays the USPS and its returned services as a staple to revive the United States government in a post-apocalyptic world. It was adapted as a film starring Kevin Costner and Larenz Tate in 1997. * The comedy film Dear God (1996), starring Greg Kinnear and Laurie Metcalf, portrays a group of quirky postal workers in a dead letter office that handle letters addressed to the Easter Bunny, Elvis, and even God himself. * In 2015, The Inspectors, which depicts a group of postal inspectors investigating postal crimes, debuted on CBS.

It was initially identified by Norman E. Silberberg and Margaret C. Silberberg (1967), who defined it as the precocious ability to read words without prior training in learning to read, typically before the age of 5. They indicated that children with hyperlexia have a significantly higher word-decoding ability than their reading comprehension levels. Children with hyperlexia also present with an intense fascination for written material at a very early age. Hyperlexic children are characterized by word-reading ability well above what would be expected given their age. First named and scientifically described in 1967 (Silverberg and Silverberg), it can be viewed as a superability in which word recognition ability goes far above expected levels of skill. Some hyperlexics, however, have trouble understanding speech. Some experts believe that most children with hyperlexia, or perhaps even all of them, lie on the autism spectrum. However, one expert, Darold Treffert, proposes that hyperlexia has subtypes, only some of which overlap with autism. Between 5 and 20 percent of autistic children have been estimated to be hyperlexic. Hyperlexic children are often fascinated by letters or numbers. They are extremely good at decoding language and thus often become very early readers. Some English-speaking hyperlexic children learn to spell long words (such as elephant) before they are two years old and learn to read whole sentences before they turn three. An fMRI study of a single child showed that hyperlexia may be the neurological opposite of dyslexia.  Etymology The word hyperlexia is derived from the Greek terms hyper (\\"over, beyond, overmuch, above measure\\") and lexis (\\"word\\") . Development Although hyperlexic children usually learn to read in a non-communicative way, several studies have shown that they can acquire reading comprehension and communicative language after the onset of hyperlexia. They follow a different developmental trajectory relative to neurotypical individuals, with milestones being acquired in a different order. Despite hyperlexic children's precocious reading ability, they may struggle to communicate. Often, hyperlexic children will have a precocious ability to read but will learn to speak only by rote and heavy repetition, and may also have difficulty learning the rules of language from examples or from trial and error, which may result in social problems. Their language may develop using echolalia, often repeating words and sentences. Often, the child has a large vocabulary and can identify many objects and pictures, but cannot put their language skills to good use. Spontaneous language is lacking and their pragmatic speech is delayed. Hyperlexic children often struggle with Who? What? Where? Why? and How? questions. Between the ages of 4 and 5 years old, many children make great strides in communicating. The social skills of a child with hyperlexia often lag tremendously. Hyperlexic children often have far less interest in playing with other children than do their peers. Types of hyperlexia In one paper, Darold Treffert proposes three types of hyperlexia. Specifically: *Type 1: Neurotypical children who are very early readers. *Type 2: Children on the autism spectrum who demonstrate very early reading as a splinter skill. *Type 3: Very early readers who are not on the autism spectrum, though they exhibit some \\"autistic-like\\" traits and behaviours which gradually fade as the child gets older. A different paper by Rebecca Williamson Brown, OD proposes only two types of hyperlexia. These are: *Type 1: Hyperlexia marked by an accompanying language disorder. *Type 2: Hyperlexia marked by an accompanying visual-spatial learning disorder. Non-English studies In studies in Cantonese and Korean, subjects were able to read non-words in their native orthography without a delay relative to the speed with which they read real words in their native orthography. There is a delay noted with exception words in English, including the examples 'chaos', 'unique', and 'enough'. These studies also illustrate difficulties in understanding what it is that they are reading. The findings suggest that non-hyperlexic readers rely more heavily on word semantics in order to make inferences about word meaning. The Cantonese study distinguish homographs and determine the readings for rarely used characters. In this study, the subject also made errors of phonetic analogy and regularization of sound. The authors of the study suggest that the two- routes model for reading Chinese characters may be in effect for hyperlexics. The two-routes model describes understanding of Chinese characters in a purely phonetic sense and the understanding of Chinese characters in a semantic sense. The semantics deficit is also illustrated in the study of Korean hyperlexics through a priming experiment. Non-hyperlexic children read words primed with a related image faster than non-primed words while hyperlexics read them at the same pace. Lee Sunghee and Hwang Mina, the authors of the Korean study, also found that hyperlexics have fewer errors in non-word reading than non-hyperlexics. They suggest that this may be because of an imbalance in the phonological, orthographical, and semantic understandings of the subjects‚Äô native language and writing system, in this case, Hangul. This combination of the parts of linguistics is known as connectionist theory, in which non-words are distinguished from words by differences in interaction between phonology, orthography, and semantics. In the Lee and Hwang study, the subjects scored lower on general language test and vocabulary tests than the average for their age groups. Literacy education in South Korea involves teaching students entire words, rather than starting with the relationship between phonemes and letters in Hangul, despite evidence that letter name knowledge is useful for learning to read words that have not been taught. The results suggest that hyperlexics are able to obtain the relations between letters (or the smallest unit of the writing system) and their phonemes without knowing the names. Comprehension difficulties can also be a result of hyperlexia. Semantics and comprehension both have ties to meaning. Semantics relates to the meaning of a certain word while comprehension is the understanding of a longer text. In both studies, interpretation-based and meaning-based tests proved difficult for the hyperlexic subjects. In the Weeks study, the subject was unable to identify characters based on the logographic aspect of the writing system, and in the Lee and Hwang study, priming was ineffective in decreasing reading times for hyperlexics. Acquisition Although it is generally associated with autism, a 69-year-old woman appears to have been made hyperlexic because of a \\"cerebral infarction in the left anterior cingulate cortex and corpus callosum\\".

This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to transmit signals, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness and trouble with sensation or coordination. MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances. While the cause is unclear, the underlying mechanism is thought to be either destruction by the immune system or failure of the myelin-producing cells. Proposed causes for this include genetics and environmental factors being triggered by a viral infection. MS is usually diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests. There is no known cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks. Medications used to treat MS, while modestly effective, can have side effects and be poorly tolerated. Physical therapy can help with people's ability to function. Many people pursue alternative treatments, despite a lack of evidence of benefit. The long-term outcome is difficult to predict; good outcomes are more often seen in women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a relapsing course, and those who initially experienced few attacks. Life expectancy is on average five to ten years lower than that of the unaffected population. Multiple sclerosis is the most common immune- mediated disorder affecting the central nervous system. In 2015, about 2.3 million people were affected globally, with rates varying widely in different regions and among different populations. In that year, about 18,900 people died from MS, up from 12,000 in 1990. The disease usually begins between the ages of twenty and fifty and is twice as common in women as in men. MS was first described in 1868 by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot. The name multiple sclerosis refers to the numerous glial scars (or sclerae ‚Äì essentially plaques or lesions) that develop on the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. * A number of new treatments and diagnostic methods are under development. Signs and symptoms Main symptoms of multiple sclerosis A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common. The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties (such as neurogenic bladder), among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research. The condition begins in 85% of cases as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) over a number of days with 45% having motor or sensory problems, 20% having optic neuritis, and 10% having symptoms related to brainstem dysfunction, while the remaining 25% have more than one of the previous difficulties. The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called relapses, exacerbations, bouts, attacks, or flare-ups) followed by improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10‚Äì15% of cases). A combination of these two patterns may also occur or people may start in a relapsing and remitting course that then becomes progressive later on. Relapses are usually not predictable, occurring without warning. Exacerbations rarely occur more frequently than twice per year. Some relapses, however, are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer. Similarly, viral infections such as the common cold, influenza, or gastroenteritis increase their risk. Stress may also trigger an attack. Women with MS who become pregnant experience fewer relapses; however, during the first months after delivery the risk increases. Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability. Many events have been found not to affect relapse rates including vaccination, breast feeding, physical trauma, and Uhthoff's phenomenon. Causes The cause of MS is unknown; however, it is believed to occur as a result of some combination of genetic and environmental factors such as infectious agents. Theories try to combine the data into likely explanations, but none has proved definitive. While there are a number of environmental risk factors and although some are partly modifiable, further research is needed to determine whether their elimination can prevent MS. =Geography= MS is more common in people who live farther from the equator, although exceptions exist. These exceptions include ethnic groups that are at low risk far from the equator such as the Samis, Amerindians, Canadian Hutterites, New Zealand MƒÅori, and Canada's Inuit, as well as groups that have a relatively high risk close to the equator such as Sardinians, inland Sicilians, Palestinians, and Parsi. The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear. While the north‚Äìsouth gradient of incidence is decreasing, as of 2010 it is still present. MS is more common in regions with northern European populations and the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations. Decreased sunlight exposure resulting in decreased vitamin D production has also been put forward as an explanation. A relationship between season of birth and MS lends support to this idea, with fewer people born in the northern hemisphere in November as compared to May being affected later in life. Environmental factors may play a role during childhood, with several studies finding that people who move to a different region of the world before the age of 15 acquire the new region's risk to MS. If migration takes place after age 15, however, the person retains the risk of their home country. There is some evidence that the effect of moving may still apply to people older than 15. =Genetics= HLA region of Chromosome 6\\\\. Changes in this area increase the probability of getting MS. MS is not considered a hereditary disease; however, a number of genetic variations have been shown to increase the risk. Some of these genes appear to have higher levels of expression in microglial cells than expected by chance. The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related. In identical twins both are affected about 30% of the time, while around 5% for non-identical twins and 2.5% of siblings are affected with a lower percentage of half-siblings. If both parents are affected the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population. MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others. Specific genes that have been linked with MS include differences in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system‚Äîa group of genes on chromosome 6 that serves as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). That differences in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and this same region has also been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, it has been estimated that HLA differences account for between 20% and 60% of the genetic predisposition. Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have revealed at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS. =Infectious agents= Many microbes have been proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving at an early age from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease is a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where, in most individuals, it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination. The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis. Evidence for a virus as a cause include the presence of oligoclonal bands in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella. =Other= Smoking may be an independent risk factor for MS. Stress may be a risk factor, although the evidence to support this is weak. Association with occupational exposures and toxins‚Äîmainly solvents‚Äîhas been evaluated, but no clear conclusions have been reached. Vaccinations were studied as causal factors; however, most studies show no association. Several other possible risk factors, such as diet and hormone intake, have been looked at; however, evidence on their relation with the disease is \\"sparse and unpersuasive\\". Gout occurs less than would be expected and lower levels of uric acid have been found in people with MS. This has led to the theory that uric acid is protective, although its exact importance remains unknown. Pathophysiology Multiple sclerosis The three main characteristics of MS are the formation of lesions in the central nervous system (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of myelin sheaths of neurons. These features interact in a complex and not yet fully understood manner to produce the breakdown of nerve tissue and in turn the signs and symptoms of the disease. Cholesterol crystals are believed to both impair myelin repair and aggravate inflammation. MS is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder that develops from an interaction of the individual's genetics and as yet unidentified environmental causes. Damage is believed to be caused, at least in part, by attack on the nervous system by a person's own immune system. =Lesions= Demyelination in MS. On Kl√ºver-Barrera myelin staining, decoloration in the area of the lesion can be appreciated The name multiple sclerosis refers to the scars (sclerae ‚Äì better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, and the rest of the body. The peripheral nervous system is rarely involved. To be specific, MS involves the loss of oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer‚Äîknown as the myelin sheath‚Äîwhich helps the neurons carry electrical signals (action potentials). This results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, as the disease advances, the breakdown of the axons of neurons. When the myelin is lost, a neuron can no longer effectively conduct electrical signals. A repair process, called remyelination, takes place in early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell's myelin sheath. Repeated attacks lead to successively less effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons. These scars are the origin of the symptoms and during an attack magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows more than ten new plaques. This could indicate that there are a number of lesions below which the brain is capable of repairing itself without producing noticeable consequences. Another process involved in the creation of lesions is an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons. A number of lesion patterns have been described. =Inflammation= Apart from demyelination, the other sign of the disease is inflammation. Fitting with an immunological explanation, the inflammatory process is caused by T cells, a kind of lymphocyte that plays an important role in the body's defenses. T cells gain entry into the brain via disruptions in the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. The T cells recognize myelin as foreign and attack it, explaining why these cells are also called \\"autoreactive lymphocytes\\". The attack of myelin starts inflammatory processes, which triggers other immune cells and the release of soluble factors like cytokines and antibodies. A further breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, in turn, causes a number of other damaging effects such as swelling, activation of macrophages, and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins. Inflammation can potentially reduce transmission of information between neurons in at least three ways. The soluble factors released might stop neurotransmission by intact neurons. These factors could lead to or enhance the loss of myelin, or they may cause the axon to break down completely. =Blood‚Äìbrain barrier= The blood‚Äìbrain barrier (BBB) is a part of the capillary system that prevents the entry of T cells into the central nervous system. It may become permeable to these types of cells secondary to an infection by a virus or bacteria. After it repairs itself, typically once the infection has cleared, T cells may remain trapped inside the brain. Gadolinium cannot cross a normal BBB and, therefore, gadolinium-enhanced MRI is used to show BBB breakdowns. Diagnosis Animation showing dissemination of brain lesions in time and space as demonstrated by monthly MRI studies along a yearMultiple sclerosis as seen on MRI Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing. It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems. The McDonald criteria, which focus on clinical, laboratory, and radiologic evidence of lesions at different times and in different areas, is the most commonly used method of diagnosis with the Schumacher and Poser criteria being of mostly historical significance. Clinical data alone may be sufficient for a diagnosis of MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75‚Äì85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials. While the above criteria allow for a non-invasive diagnosis, and even though some state that the only definitive proof is an autopsy or biopsy where lesions typical of MS are detected, currently, as of 2017, there is no single test (including biopsy) that can provide a definitive diagnosis of this disease. Types and variants Several phenotypes (commonly termed types), or patterns of progression, have been described. Phenotypes use the past course of the disease in an attempt to predict the future course. They are important not only for prognosis but also for treatment decisions. Currently, the United States National Multiple Sclerosis Society and the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation, describes four types of MS (revised in 2013): # Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) # Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) # Primary progressive MS (PPMS) # Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) Relapsing-remitting MS is characterized by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet (remission) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave problems, the latter in about 40% of attacks and being more common the longer a person has had the disease. This describes the initial course of 80% of individuals with MS. The relapsing-remitting subtype usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In CIS, a person has an attack suggestive of demyelination, but does not fulfill the criteria for multiple sclerosis. 30 to 70% of persons who experience CIS, later develop MS. Primary progressive MS occurs in approximately 10‚Äì20% of individuals, with no remission after the initial symptoms. It is characterized by progression of disability from onset, with no, or only occasional and minor, remissions and improvements. The usual age of onset for the primary progressive subtype is later than of the relapsing-remitting subtype. It is similar to the age that secondary progressive usually begins in relapsing-remitting MS, around 40 years of age. Secondary progressive MS occurs in around 65% of those with initial relapsing-remitting MS, who eventually have progressive neurologic decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of remission. Occasional relapses and minor remissions may appear. The most common length of time between disease onset and conversion from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive MS is 19 years. Multiple sclerosis behaves differently in children, taking more time to reach the progressive stage. Nevertheless, they still reach it at a lower average age than adults usually do. =Special courses= Independently of the types published by the MS associations, regulatory agencies like the FDA often consider special courses, trying to reflect some clinical trials results on their approval documents. Some examples could be \\"Highly Active MS\\" (HAMS), \\"Active Secondary MS\\" (similar to the old Progressive-Relapsing)Novartis press release about the approval and \\"Rapidly progressing PPMS\\". Also, when deficits always resolve between attacks, this is sometimes referred to as benign MS, although people will still build up some degree of disability in the long term. On the other hand, the term malignant multiple sclerosis is used to describe people with MS having reached significant level of disability in a short period. As of June 2020 an international panel has published a standardized definition for the course HAMS =Variants= Atypical variants of MS have been described; these include tumefactive multiple sclerosis, Balo concentric sclerosis, Schilder's diffuse sclerosis, and Marburg multiple sclerosis. There is debate on whether they are MS variants or different diseases. Some diseases previously considered MS variants like Devic's disease are now considered outside the MS spectrum. Management Although there is no known cure for multiple sclerosis, several therapies have proven helpful. The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. Starting medications is generally recommended in people after the first attack when more than two lesions are seen on MRI. As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS have several adverse effects. Alternative treatments are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence. =Acute attacks= During symptomatic attacks, administration of high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile. Although effective in the short term for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a significant impact on long-term recovery. The long term benefit is unclear in optic neuritis as of 2020. The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis. =Disease-modifying treatments= Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis As of 2020, multiple disease-modifying medications are approved by regulatory agencies for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). They are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab, siponimod, cladribine, and ozanimod. Their cost effectiveness as of 2012 is unclear. In March 2017, the FDA approved ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, as a treatment for RRMS, with requirements for several Phase IV clinical trials. In RRMS they are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved for those who do not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option for those who do not respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, is not yet entirely clear. It is difficult to make firm conclusions about the best treatment, especially regarding the long‚Äêterm benefit and safety of early treatment, given the lack of studies directly comparing disease modifying therapies or long-term monitoring of patient outcomes. As of 2017, rituximab was widely used off-label to treat RRMS. There is a lack of high quality randomised control trials examining rituximab versus placebo or other disease-modifying therapies, and as such the benefits of rituximab for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis remain inconclusive. The relative effectiveness of different treatments is unclear, as most have only been compared to placebo or a small number of other therapies. Direct comparisons of interferons and glatiramer acetate indicate similar effects or only small differences in effects on relapse rate, disease progression and magnetic resonance imaging measures. Alemtuzumab, natalizumab, and fingolimod may be more effective than other drugs in reducing relapses over the short term in people with RRMS. Natalizumab and interferon beta-1a (Rebif) may reduce relapses compared to both placebo and interferon beta-1a (Avonex) while Interferon beta-1b (Betaseron), glatiramer acetate, and mitoxantrone may also prevent relapses. Evidence on relative effectiveness in reducing disability progression is unclear. All medications are associated with adverse effects that may influence their risk to benefit profiles. Progressive multiple sclerosis As of 2013, review of 9 immunomodulators and immunosuppressants found no evidence of any being effective in preventing disability progression in people with progressive MS. As of 2017, rituximab has been widely used off-label to treat progressive primary MS. In March 2017 the FDA approved ocrelizumab as a treatment for primary progressive MS, the first drug to gain that approval, with requirements for several Phase IV clinical trials. , only one medication, mitoxantrone, had been approved for secondary progressive MS. In this population tentative evidence supports mitoxantrone moderately slowing the progression of the disease and decreasing rates of relapses over two years. In 2017, ocrelizumab was approved in the United States for the treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis in adults. It is also used for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease in adults. In 2019, siponimod and cladribine were approved in the United States for the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Adverse effects Irritation zone after injection of glatiramer acetate. The disease-modifying treatments have several adverse effects. One of the most common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated). Fingolimod may give rise to hypertension and slowed heart rate, macular edema, elevated liver enzymes or a reduction in lymphocyte levels. Tentative evidence supports the short-term safety of teriflunomide, with common side effects including: headaches, fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and limb pain. There have also been reports of liver failure and PML with its use and it is dangerous for fetal development. Most common side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems. While dimethyl fumarate may lead to a reduction in the white blood cell count there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during trials. =Associated symptoms= Both medications and neurorehabilitation have been shown to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as bladder spasticity, while others are little changed. Equipment such as catheters for neurogenic bladder or mobility aids can be helpful in improving functional status. A multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. Studies investigating information provision in support of patient understanding and participation suggest that while interventions (written information, decision aids, coaching, educational programmes) may increase knowledge, the evidence of an effect on decision making and quality of life is mixed and low certainty. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychological therapies are effective. Cognitive training, alone or combined with other neuropsychological interventions, may show positive effects for memory and attention though firm conclusions are not currently possible given small sample numbers, variable methodology, interventions and outcome measures. The effectiveness of palliative approaches in addition to standard care is uncertain, due to lack of evidence. The effectiveness of interventions, including exercise, specifically for the prevention of falls in people with MS is uncertain, while there is some evidence of an effect on balance function and mobility. Cognitive behavioral therapy has shown to be moderately effective for reducing MS fatigue. The evidence for the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for chronic pain is insufficient to recommend such interventions alone, however their use in combination with medications may be reasonable. =Alternative treatments= Over 50% of people with MS may use complementary and alternative medicine, although percentages vary depending on how alternative medicine is defined. Regarding the characteristics of users, they are more frequently women, have had MS for a longer time, tend to be more disabled and have lower levels of satisfaction with conventional healthcare. The evidence for the effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Treatments of unproven benefit used by people with MS include dietary supplementation and regimens, vitamin D, relaxation techniques such as yoga, herbal medicine (including medical cannabis), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, self-infection with hookworms, reflexology, acupuncture, and mindfulness. Evidence suggests vitamin D supplementation, irrespective of the form and dose, provides no benefit for people with MS; this includes for measures such as relapse recurrence, disability, and MRI lesions while effects on health‚Äêrelated quality of life and fatigue are unclear. Prognosis Disability-adjusted life year for multiple sclerosis per 100,000 inhabitants in 2012 The expected future course of the disease depends on the subtype of the disease; the individual's sex, age, and initial symptoms; and the degree of disability the person has. Female sex, relapsing-remitting subtype, optic neuritis or sensory symptoms at onset, few attacks in the initial years and especially early age at onset, are associated with a better course. The average life expectancy is 30 years from the start of the disease, which is 5 to 10 years less than that of unaffected people. Almost 40% of people with MS reach the seventh decade of life. Nevertheless, two-thirds of the deaths are directly related to the consequences of the disease. Suicide is more common, while infections and other complications are especially dangerous for the more disabled. Although most people lose the ability to walk before death, 90% are capable of independent walking at 10 years from onset, and 75% at 15 years. Epidemiology Deaths from multiple sclerosis per million persons in 2012 MS is the most common autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system. As of 2010, the number of people with MS was 2‚Äì2.5 million (approximately 30 per 100,000) globally, with rates varying widely in different regions. It is estimated to have resulted in 18,000 deaths that year. In Africa rates are less than 0.5 per 100,000, while they are 2.8 per 100,000 in South East Asia, 8.3 per 100,000 in the Americas, and 80 per 100,000 in Europe. Rates surpass 200 per 100,000 in certain populations of Northern European descent. The number of new cases that develop per year is about 2.5 per 100,000. Rates of MS appear to be increasing; this, however, may be explained simply by better diagnosis. Studies on populational and geographical patterns have been common and have led to a number of theories about the cause. MS usually appears in adults in their late twenties or early thirties but it can rarely start in childhood and after 50 years of age. The primary progressive subtype is more common in people in their fifties. Similar to many autoimmune disorders, the disease is more common in women, and the trend may be increasing. As of 2008, globally it is about two times more common in women than in men. In children, it is even more common in females than males, while in people over fifty, it affects males and females almost equally. History =Medical discovery= Detail of Carswell's drawing of MS lesions in the brain stem and spinal cord (1838) Robert Carswell (1793‚Äì1857), a British professor of pathology, and Jean Cruveilhier (1791‚Äì1873), a French professor of pathologic anatomy, described and illustrated many of the disease's clinical details, but did not identify it as a separate disease. Specifically, Carswell described the injuries he found as \\"a remarkable lesion of the spinal cord accompanied with atrophy\\". Under the microscope, Swiss pathologist Georg Eduard Rindfleisch (1836‚Äì1908) noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around blood vessels. The French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot (1825‚Äì1893) was the first person to recognize multiple sclerosis as a distinct disease in 1868. Summarizing previous reports and adding his own clinical and pathological observations, Charcot called the disease sclerose en plaques. =Diagnosis history= The first attempt to establish a set of diagnostic criteria was also due to Charcot in 1868. He published what now is known as the \\"Charcot Triad\\", consisting in nystagmus, intention tremor, and telegraphic speech (scanning speech)R. Milo, A. Miller, Revised diagnostic criteria of multiple sclerosis, Autoimmunity Reviews 13 (2014), 12 January 2014, 518‚Äì524 Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a \\"marked enfeeblement of the memory\\" and \\"conceptions that formed slowly\\". Diagnosis was based on Charcot triad and clinical observation until Schumacher made the first attempt to standardize criteria in 1965 by introducing some fundamental requirements: Dissemination of the lesions in time (DIT) and space (DIS), and that \\"signs and symptoms cannot be explained better by another disease process\\". Both requirements were later inherited by Poser criteria and McDonald criteria, whose 2010 version is currently in use. During the 20th century, theories about the cause and pathogenesis were developed and effective treatments began to appear in the 1990s. Since the beginning of the 21st century, refinements of the concepts have taken place. The 2010 revision of the McDonald criteria allowed for the diagnosis of MS with only one proved lesion (CIS). In 1996, the US National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) (Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials) defined the first version of the clinical phenotypes that is currently in use. In this first version they provided standardized definitions for 4 MS clinical courses: relapsing- remitting (RR), secondary progressive (SP), primary progressive (PP), and progressive relapsing (PR). In 2010, PR was dropped and CIS was incorporated. Subsequently, three years later, the 2013 revision of the \\"phenotypes for the disease course\\" were forced to consider CIS as one of the phenotypes of MS, making obsolete some expressions like \\"conversion from CIS to MS\\". Other organizations have proposed later new clinical phenotypes, like HAMS (Highly Active MS) as result of the work in DMT approval processes. =Historical cases= Photographic study of locomotion of a female with MS with walking difficulties created in 1887 by Muybridge There are several historical accounts of people who probably had MS and lived before or shortly after the disease was described by Charcot. A young woman called Halldora who lived in Iceland around 1200 suddenly lost her vision and mobility but, after praying to the saints, recovered them seven days after. Saint Lidwina of Schiedam (1380‚Äì1433), a Dutch nun, may be one of the first clearly identifiable people with MS. From the age of 16 until her death at 53, she had intermittent pain, weakness of the legs, and vision loss‚Äîsymptoms typical of MS. Both cases have led to the proposal of a \\"Viking gene\\" hypothesis for the dissemination of the disease. Augustus Frederick d'Este (1794‚Äì1848), son of Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex and Lady Augusta Murray and the grandson of George III of the United Kingdom, almost certainly had MS. D'Este left a detailed diary describing his 22 years living with the disease. His diary began in 1822 and ended in 1846, although it remained unknown until 1948. His symptoms began at age 28 with a sudden transient visual loss (amaurosis fugax) after the funeral of a friend. During his disease, he developed weakness of the legs, clumsiness of the hands, numbness, dizziness, bladder disturbances, and erectile dysfunction. In 1844, he began to use a wheelchair. Despite his illness, he kept an optimistic view of life. Another early account of MS was kept by the British diarist W. N. P. Barbellion, nom-de-plume of Bruce Frederick Cummings (1889‚Äì1919), who maintained a detailed log of his diagnosis and struggle. His diary was published in 1919 as The Journal of a Disappointed Man. Research =Medications= Chemical structure of alemtuzumab There is ongoing research looking for more effective, convenient, and tolerable treatments for relapsing-remitting MS; creation of therapies for the progressive subtypes; neuroprotection strategies; and effective symptomatic treatments. During the 2000s and 2010s, there has been approval of several oral drugs that are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use. Several more oral drugs are under investigation, including ozanimod, laquinimod, and estriol. Laquinimod was announced in August 2012 and is in a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, studies aimed to improve the efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies are occurring. This includes the use of new preparations such as the PEGylated version of interferon-Œ≤-1a, which it is hoped may be given at less frequent doses with similar effects. Estriol, a female sex hormone found at high concentrations during late pregnancy, has been identified as a candidate therapy for women with relapsing-remitting MS and has progressed through Phase II trials. Request for approval of peginterferon beta-1a is expected during 2013. Preliminary data suggests that mycophenolate mofetil, an anti-rejection immunosuppressant medication, might have benefits in multiple sclerosis. However the evidence is insufficient to determine the effects as an add‚Äêon therapy for interferon beta-1a in people with RRMS. Monoclonal antibodies have also raised high levels of interest. As of 2012 alemtuzumab, daclizumab, and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab had all shown some benefit and were under study as potential treatments, and the FDA approved ocrelizumab for relapsing and primary MS in March 2017. Their use has also been accompanied by the appearance of potentially dangerous adverse effects, the most important of which being opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the development of a test for JC virus antibodies, which might help to determine who is at greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies will probably have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated with them. Another research strategy is to evaluate the combined effectiveness of two or more drugs. The main rationale for using a number of medications in MS is that the involved treatments target different mechanisms and, therefore, their use is not necessarily exclusive. Synergies, in which one drug improves the effect of another are also possible, but there can also be drawbacks such as the blocking of the action of the other or worsened side-effects. There have been several trials of combined therapy, yet none have shown positive enough results to be considered as a useful treatment for MS. Research on neuroprotection and regenerative treatments, such as stem cell therapy, while of high importance, are in the early stages. Likewise, there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease. Many of the newest drugs as well as those under development are probably going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS. Medications that influence voltage- gated sodium ion channels are under investigation as a potential neuroprotective strategy because of hypothesized role of sodium in the pathological process leading to axonal injury and accumulating disability. Currently, there is insufficient evidence of an effect of sodium channel blockers for people with MS. =Pathogenesis= MS is a clinically defined entity with several atypical presentations. Some auto-antibodies have been found in atypical MS cases, giving birth to separate disease families and restricting the previously wider concept of MS. First of all, anti-AQP4 autoantibodies were found in neuromyelitis optica (NMO), which was previously considered a MS variant. After that, a whole spectrum of diseases named NMOSD (NMO spectrum diseases) or anti-AQP4 diseases has been accepted. Later, it was found that some cases of MS were presenting anti-MOG autoantibodies, mainly overlapping with the Marburg variant. Anti-MOG autoantibodies were found to be also present in ADEM, and now a second spectrum of separated diseases is being considered. At this moment, it is named inconsistently across different authors, but it is normally something similar to anti-MOG demyelinating diseases. Finally, a third kind of auto-antibodies is accepted. They are several anti-neurofascin auto-antibodies which damage the Ranvier nodes of the neurones. These antibodies are more related to the peripheral nervous demyelination, but they were also found in chronic progressive PPMS and combined central and peripheral demyelination (CCPD, which is considered another atypical MS presentation). Besides all this autoantibodies found, four different patterns of demyelination have been reported in MS, opening the door to consider MS as an heterogeneous disease. =Disease biomarkers= MRI brain scan produced using a Gradient-echo phase sequence showing an iron deposit in a white matter lesion (inside green box in the middle of the image; enhanced and marked by red arrow top-left corner) While diagnostic criteria are not expected to change in the near future, work to develop biomarkers that help with diagnosis and prediction of disease progression is ongoing. New diagnostic methods that are being investigated include work with anti-myelin antibodies, and studies with serum and cerebrospinal fluid, but none of them has yielded reliably positive results. At the current time, there are no laboratory investigations that can predict prognosis. Several promising approaches have been proposed including: interleukin-6, nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase, osteopontin, and fetuin-A. Since disease progression is the result of degeneration of neurons, the roles of proteins showing loss of nerve tissue such as neurofilaments, tau, and N-acetylaspartate are under investigation. Other effects include looking for biomarkers that distinguish between those who will and will not respond to medications. Improvement in neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) carry a promise for better diagnosis and prognosis predictions, although the effect of such improvements in daily medical practice may take several decades. Regarding MRI, there are several techniques that have already shown some usefulness in research settings and could be introduced into clinical practice, such as double-inversion recovery sequences, magnetization transfer, diffusion tensor, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. These techniques are more specific for the disease than existing ones, but still lack some standardization of acquisition protocols and the creation of normative values. There are other techniques under development that include contrast agents capable of measuring levels of peripheral macrophages, inflammation, or neuronal dysfunction, and techniques that measure iron deposition that could serve to determine the role of this feature in MS, or that of cerebral perfusion. Similarly, new PET radiotracers might serve as markers of altered processes such as brain inflammation, cortical pathology, apoptosis, or remyelination. Antibiodies against the Kir4.1 potassium channel may be related to MS. =Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency= In 2008, vascular surgeon Paolo Zamboni suggested that MS involves narrowing of the veins draining the brain, which he referred to as chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI). He found CCSVI in all patients with MS in his study, performed a surgical procedure, later called in the media the \\"liberation procedure\\" to correct it, and claimed that 73% of participants improved. This theory received significant attention in the media and among those with MS, especially in Canada. Concerns have been raised with Zamboni's research as it was neither blinded nor controlled, and its assumptions about the underlying cause of the disease are not backed by known data. Also, further studies have either not found a similar relationship or found one that is much less strong, raising serious objections to the hypothesis. The \\"liberation procedure\\" has been criticized for resulting in serious complications and deaths with unproven benefits. It is, thus, as of 2013 not recommended for the treatment of MS. Additional research investigating the CCSVI hypothesis are under way.

Signs and symptoms vary among people and over time. Often, symptoms include poor coordination, stiff muscles, weak muscles, and tremors. There may be problems with sensation, vision, hearing, swallowing, and speaking. Often, babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over, sit, crawl or walk as early as other children of their age. Other symptoms include seizures and problems with thinking or reasoning, which each occur in about one third of people with CP. While symptoms may get more noticeable over the first few years of life, underlying problems do not worsen over time. Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development or damage to the parts of the brain that control movement, balance, and posture. Most often, the problems occur during pregnancy; however, they may also occur during childbirth or shortly after birth. Often, the cause is unknown. Risk factors include preterm birth, being a twin, certain infections during pregnancy such as toxoplasmosis or rubella, exposure to methylmercury during pregnancy, a difficult delivery, and head trauma during the first few years of life, among others. About 2% of cases are believed to be due to an inherited genetic cause. A number of sub-types are classified based on the specific problems present. For example, those with stiff muscles have spastic cerebral palsy, those with poor coordination have ataxic cerebral palsy and those with writhing movements have dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Diagnosis is based on the child's development over time. Blood tests and medical imaging may be used to rule out other possible causes. CP is partly preventable through immunization of the mother and efforts to prevent head injuries in children such as through improved safety. There is no known cure for CP; however, supportive treatments, medications and surgery may help many individuals. This may include physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. Medications such as diazepam, baclofen and botulinum toxin may help relax stiff muscles. Surgery may include lengthening muscles and cutting overly active nerves. Often, external braces and other assistive technology are helpful. Some affected children can achieve near normal adult lives with appropriate treatment. While alternative medicines are frequently used, there is no evidence to support their use. Cerebral palsy is the most common movement disorder in children. It occurs in about 2.1 per 1,000 live births. Cerebral palsy has been documented throughout history, with the first known descriptions occurring in the work of Hippocrates in the 5th century BCE. Extensive study of the condition began in the 19th century by William John Little, after whom spastic diplegia was called \\"Little's disease\\". William Osler first named it \\"cerebral palsy\\" from the German zerebrale Kinderl√§hmung (cerebral child-paralysis). A number of potential treatments are being examined, including stem cell therapy. However, more research is required to determine if it is effective and safe. Signs and symptoms Cerebral palsy is defined as \\"a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation, that are attributed to non- progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain.\\" While movement problems are the central feature of CP, difficulties with thinking, learning, feeling, communication and behavior often co-occur, with 28% having epilepsy, 58% having difficulties with communication, at least 42% having problems with their vision, and 2356% having learning disabilities. Muscle contractions in people with cerebral palsy are commonly thought to arise from overactivation. Cerebral palsy is characterized by abnormal muscle tone, reflexes, or motor development and coordination. The neurological lesion is primary and permanent while orthopedic manifestations are secondary and progressive. In cerebral palsy unequal growth between muscle-tendon units and bone eventually leads to bone and joint deformities. At first deformities are dynamic. Over time, deformities tend to become static, and joint contractures develop. Deformities in general and static deformities in specific (joint contractures) cause increasing gait difficulties in the form of tip-toeing gait, due to tightness of the Achilles tendon, and scissoring gait, due to tightness of the hip adductors. These gait patterns are among the most common gait abnormalities in children with cerebral palsy. However, orthopaedic manifestations of cerebral palsy are diverse. Additionally, crouch gait -excessive knee flexion gait- is prevalent among children who possess the ability to walk. The effects of cerebral palsy fall on a continuum of motor dysfunction, which may range from slight clumsiness at the mild end of the spectrum to impairments so severe that they render coordinated movement virtually impossible at the other end of the spectrum. Although most people with CP have problems with increased muscle tone, some have normal or low muscle tone. High muscle tone can either be due to spasticity or dystonia. Babies born with severe cerebral palsy often have an irregular posture; their bodies may be either very floppy or very stiff. Birth defects, such as spinal curvature, a small jawbone, or a small head sometimes occur along with CP. Symptoms may appear or change as a child gets older. Babies born with cerebral palsy do not immediately present with symptoms. Classically, CP becomes evident when the baby reaches the developmental stage at 6 to 9 months and is starting to mobilise, where preferential use of limbs, asymmetry, or gross motor developmental delay is seen. Drooling is common among children with cerebral palsy, which can have a variety of impacts including social rejection, impaired speaking, damage to clothing and books, and mouth infections. It can additionally cause choking. An average of 55.5% of people with cerebral palsy experience lower urinary tract symptoms, more commonly excessive storage issues than voiding issues. Those with voiding issues and pelvic floor overactivity can deteriorate as adults and experience upper urinary tract dysfunction. Children with CP may also have sensory processing issues. Adults with cerebral palsy have a higher risk of respiratory failure. =Skeleton= For bones to attain their normal shape and size, they require the stresses from normal musculature. People with cerebral palsy are at risk of low bone mineral density. The shafts of the bones are often thin (gracile), and become thinner during growth. When compared to these thin shafts (diaphyses), the centres (metaphyses) often appear quite enlarged (ballooning). Due to more than normal joint compression caused by muscular imbalances, articular cartilage may atrophy, leading to narrowed joint spaces. Depending on the degree of spasticity, a person with CP may exhibit a variety of angular joint deformities. Because vertebral bodies need vertical gravitational loading forces to develop properly, spasticity and an abnormal gait can hinder proper or full bone and skeletal development. People with CP tend to be shorter in height than the average person because their bones are not allowed to grow to their full potential. Sometimes bones grow to different lengths, so the person may have one leg longer than the other. Children with CP are prone to low trauma fractures, particularly children with higher GMFCS levels who cannot walk. This further affects a child's mobility, strength, experience of pain, and can lead to missed schooling or child abuse suspicions. These children generally have fractures in the legs, whereas non- affected children mostly fracture their arms in the context of sporting activities. Hip dislocation and ankle equinus or planter flexion deformity are the two most common deformities among children with cerebral palsy. Additionally, flexion deformity of the hip and knee can occur. Besides, torsional deformities of long bones such as the femur and tibia are encountered among others. Children may develop scoliosis before the age of 10 ‚Äì estimated prevalence of scoliosis in children with CP is between 21% and 64%. Higher levels of impairment on the GMFCS are associated with scoliosis and hip dislocation. Scoliosis can be corrected with surgery, but CP makes surgical complications more likely, even with improved techniques. Hip migration can be managed by soft tissue procedures such as adductor musculature release. Advanced degrees of hip migration or dislocation can be managed by more extensive procedures such as femoral and pelvic corrective osteotomies. Both soft tissue and bony procedures aim at prevention of hip dislocation in the early phases or aim at hip containment and restoration of anatomy in the late phases of disease. Equinus deformity is managed by conservative methods especially when dynamic. If fixed/static deformity ensues surgery may become mandatory. Growth spurts during puberty can make walking more difficult. =Eating= Due to sensory and motor impairments, those with CP may have difficulty preparing food, holding utensils, or chewing and swallowing. An infant with CP may not be able to suck, swallow or chew. Gastro-oesophageal reflux is common in children with CP. Children with CP may have too little or too much sensitivity around and in the mouth. Poor balance when sitting, lack of control of the head, mouth and trunk, not being able to bend the hips enough to allow the arms to stretch forward to reach and grasp food or utensils, and lack of hand-eye coordination can make self-feeding difficult. Feeding difficulties are related to higher GMFCS levels. Dental problems can also contribute to difficulties with eating. Pneumonia is also common where eating difficulties exist, caused by undetected aspiration of food or liquids. Fine finger dexterity, like that needed for picking up a utensil, is more frequently impaired than gross manual dexterity, like that needed for spooning food onto a plate. Grip strength impairments are less common. Children with severe cerebral palsy, particularly with oropharyngeal issues, are at risk of undernutrition. Triceps skin fold tests have been found to be a very reliable indicator of malnutrition in children with cerebral palsy. =Language= Speech and language disorders are common in people with cerebral palsy. The incidence of dysarthria is estimated to range from 31% to 88%, and around a quarter of people with CP are non-verbal. Speech problems are associated with poor respiratory control, laryngeal and velopharyngeal dysfunction, and oral articulation disorders that are due to restricted movement in the oral-facial muscles. There are three major types of dysarthria in cerebral palsy: spastic, dyskinetic (athetosis), and ataxic. Early use of augmentative and alternative communication systems may assist the child in developing spoken language skills. Overall language delay is associated with problems of cognition, deafness, and learned helplessness. Children with cerebral palsy are at risk of learned helplessness and becoming passive communicators, initiating little communication. Early intervention with this clientele, and their parents, often targets situations in which children communicate with others so that they learn that they can control people and objects in their environment through this communication, including making choices, decisions, and mistakes. =Pain and sleep= Pain is common and may result from the inherent deficits associated with the condition, along with the numerous procedures children typically face. When children with cerebral palsy are in pain, they experience worse muscle spasms. Pain is associated with tight or shortened muscles, abnormal posture, stiff joints, unsuitable orthosis, etc. Hip migration or dislocation is a recognizable source of pain in CP children and especially in the adolescent population. Nevertheless, the adequate scoring and scaling of pain in CP children remains challenging. Pain in CP has a number of different causes, and different pains respond to different treatments. There is also a high likelihood of chronic sleep disorders secondary to both physical and environmental factors. Children with cerebral palsy have significantly higher rates of sleep disturbance than typically developing children. Babies with cerebral palsy who have stiffness issues might cry more and be harder to put to sleep than non-disabled babies, or \\"floppy\\" babies might be lethargic. Chronic pain is under-recognized in children with cerebral palsy, even though 3 out of 4 children with cerebral palsy experience pain. =Associated disorders= Associated disorders include intellectual disabilities, seizures, muscle contractures, abnormal gait, osteoporosis, communication disorders, malnutrition, sleep disorders, and mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. In addition to these, functional gastrointestinal abnormalities contributing to bowel obstruction, vomiting, and constipation may also arise. Adults with cerebral palsy may have ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, and trauma more often. Obesity in people with cerebral palsy or a more severe Gross Motor Function Classification System assessment in particular are considered risk factors for multimorbidity. Other medical issues can be mistaken for being symptoms of cerebral palsy, and so may not be treated correctly. Related conditions can include apraxia, dysarthria or other communication disorders, sensory impairments, urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, or behavioural disorders. Seizure management is more difficult in people with CP as seizures often last longer. Epilepsy and asthma are common co-occurring diseases in adults with CP. The associated disorders that co-occur with cerebral palsy may be more disabling than the motor function problems. Causes Micrograph showing a fetal (placental) vein thrombosis, in a case of fetal thrombotic vasculopathy. This is associated with cerebral palsy and is suggestive of a hypercoagulable state as the underlying cause. Cerebral palsy is due to abnormal development or damage occurring to the developing brain. This damage can occur during pregnancy, delivery, the first month of life, or less commonly in early childhood. Structural problems in the brain are seen in 80% of cases, most commonly within the white matter. More than three-quarters of cases are believed to result from issues that occur during pregnancy. Most children who are born with cerebral palsy have more than one risk factor associated with CP. While in certain cases there is no identifiable cause, typical causes include problems in intrauterine development (e.g. exposure to radiation, infection, fetal growth restriction), hypoxia of the brain (thrombotic events, placental conditions), birth trauma during labor and delivery, and complications around birth or during childhood. In Africa birth asphyxia, high bilirubin levels, and infections in newborns of the central nervous system are main cause. Many cases of CP in Africa could be prevented with better resources available. =Preterm birth= Between 40% and 50% of all children who develop cerebral palsy were born prematurely. Most of these cases (75-90%) are believed due to issues that occur around the time of birth, often just after birth. Multiple-birth infants are also more likely than single-birth infants to have CP. They are also more likely to be born with a low birth weight. In those who are born with a weight between 1 kg and 1.5 kg CP occurs in 6%. Among those born before 28 weeks of gestation it occurs in 11%. Genetic factors are believed to play an important role in prematurity and cerebral palsy generally. While in those who are born between 34 and 37 weeks the risk is 0.4% (three times normal). =Term infants= In babies that are born at term risk factors include problems with the placenta, birth defects, low birth weight, breathing meconium into the lungs, a delivery requiring either the use of instruments or an emergency Caesarean section, birth asphyxia, seizures just after birth, respiratory distress syndrome, low blood sugar, and infections in the baby. , it was unclear how much of a role birth asphyxia plays as a cause. It is unclear if the size of the placenta plays a role. it is evident that in advanced countries, most cases of cerebral palsy in term or near-term neonates have explanations other than asphyxia. =Genetics= Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. About 2% of all CP cases are inherited, with glutamate decarboxylase-1 being one of the possible enzymes involved. Most inherited cases are autosomal recessive. =Early childhood= After birth, other causes include toxins, severe jaundice, lead poisoning, physical brain injury, stroke, abusive head trauma, incidents involving hypoxia to the brain (such as near drowning), and encephalitis or meningitis. =Others= Infections in the mother, even those not easily detected, can triple the risk of the child developing cerebral palsy . Infections of the fetal membranes known as chorioamnionitis increases the risk. Intrauterine and neonatal insults (many of which are infectious) increase the risk. It has been hypothesised that some cases of cerebral palsy are caused by the death in very early pregnancy of an identical twin. Rh blood type incompatibility can cause the mother's immune system to attack the baby's red blood cells. Diagnosis The diagnosis of cerebral palsy has historically rested on the person's history and physical examination. A general movements assessment, which involves measuring movements that occur spontaneously among those less than four months of age, appears most accurate. Children who are more severely affected are more likely to be noticed and diagnosed earlier. Abnormal muscle tone, delayed motor development and persistence of primitive reflexes are the main early symptoms of CP. Symptoms and diagnosis typically occur by the age of 2, although persons with milder forms of cerebral palsy may be over the age of 5, if not in adulthood, when finally diagnosed. Early diagnosis and intervention are seen as being a key part of managing cerebral palsy. It is a developmental disability. Once a person is diagnosed with cerebral palsy, further diagnostic tests are optional. Neuroimaging with CT or MRI is warranted when the cause of a person's cerebral palsy has not been established. An MRI is preferred over CT, due to diagnostic yield and safety. When abnormal, the neuroimaging study can suggest the timing of the initial damage. The CT or MRI is also capable of revealing treatable conditions, such as hydrocephalus, porencephaly, arteriovenous malformation, subdural hematomas and hygromas, and a vermian tumour (which a few studies suggest are present 5‚Äì22% of the time). Furthermore, an abnormal neuroimaging study indicates a high likelihood of associated conditions, such as epilepsy and intellectual disability. There is a small risk associated with sedating children to facilitate a clear MRI. The age when CP is diagnosed is important, but medical professionals disagree over the best age to make the diagnosis. The earlier CP is diagnosed correctly, the better the opportunities are to provide the child with physical and educational help, but there might be a greater chance of confusing CP with another problem, especially if the child is 18 months of age or younger. Infants may have temporary problems with muscle tone or control that can be confused with CP, which is permanent. A metabolism disorder or tumors in the nervous system may appear to be CP; metabolic disorders, in particular, can produce brain problems that look like CP on an MRI. Disorders that deteriorate the white matter in the brain and problems that cause spasms and weakness in the legs, may be mistaken for CP if they first appear early in life. However, these disorders get worse over time, and CP does not (although it may change in character). In infancy it may not be possible to tell the difference between them. In the UK, not being able to sit independently by the age of 8 months is regarded as a clinical sign for further monitoring. Fragile X syndrome (a cause of autism and intellectual disability) and general intellectual disability must also be ruled out. Cerebral palsy specialist John McLaughlin recommends waiting until the child is 36 months of age before making a diagnosis, because by that age, motor capacity is easier to assess. =Classification= CP is classified by the types of motor impairment of the limbs or organs, and by restrictions to the activities an affected person may perform. The Gross Motor Function Classification System-Expanded and Revised and the Manual Ability Classification System are used to describe mobility and manual dexterity in people with cerebral palsy, and recently the Communication Function Classification System, and the Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System have been proposed to describe those functions. There are three main CP classifications by motor impairment: spastic, ataxic, and dyskinetic. Additionally, there is a mixed type that shows a combination of features of the other types. These classifications reflect the areas of the brain that are damaged. Cerebral palsy is also classified according to the topographic distribution of muscle spasticity. This method classifies children as diplegic, (bilateral involvement with leg involvement greater than arm involvement), hemiplegic (unilateral involvement), or quadriplegic (bilateral involvement with arm involvement equal to or greater than leg involvement). Spastic Spastic cerebral palsy is the type of cerebral palsy characterized by spasticity or high muscle tone often resulting in stiff, jerky movements. Itself an umbrella term encompassing spastic hemiplegia, spastic diplegia, spastic quadriplegia and ‚Äî where solely one limb or one specific area of the body is affected‚Äî spastic monoplegia. Spastic cerebral palsy affects the motor cortex of the brain, a specific portion of the cerebral cortex responsible for the planning and completion of voluntary movement. Spastic CP is the most common type of overall cerebral palsy, representing about 80% of cases. Botulinum toxin is effective in decreasing spasticity. It can help increase range of motion which could help mitigate CPs effects on the growing bones of children. There is an improvement in motor functions in the children and ability to walk. Ataxic Ataxic cerebral palsy is observed in approximately 5-10% of all cases of cerebral palsy, making it the least frequent form of cerebral palsy. Ataxic cerebral palsy is caused by damage to cerebellar structures. Because of the damage to the cerebellum, which is essential for coordinating muscle movements and balance, patients with ataxic cerebral palsy experience problems in coordination, specifically in their arms, legs, and trunk. Ataxic cerebral palsy is known to decrease muscle tone. The most common manifestation of ataxic cerebral palsy is intention (action) tremor, which is especially apparent when carrying out precise movements, such as tying shoe laces or writing with a pencil. This symptom gets progressively worse as the movement persists, making the hand shake. As the hand gets closer to accomplishing the intended task, the trembling intensifies, which makes it even more difficult to complete. Dyskinetic Dyskinetic cerebral palsy (sometimes abbreviated DCP) is primarily associated with damage to the basal ganglia and the substantia nigra in the form of lesions that occur during brain development due to bilirubin encephalopathy and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. DCP is characterized by both hypertonia and hypotonia, due to the affected individual's inability to control muscle tone. Clinical diagnosis of DCP typically occurs within 18 months of birth and is primarily based upon motor function and neuroimaging techniques. Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is a extrapyramidal form of cerebral palsy. Dyskinetic cerebral palsy can be divided into two different groups; choreoathetosis and dystonia. Choreo-athetotic CP is characterized by involuntary movements, whereas dystonic CP is characterized by slow, strong contractions, which may occur locally or encompass the whole body. Mixed Mixed cerebral palsy has symptoms of dyskinetic, ataxic and spastic CP appearing simultaneously, each to varying degrees, and both with and without symptoms of each. Mixed CP is the most difficult to treat as it is extremely heterogeneous and sometimes unpredictable in its symptoms and development over the lifespan. Prevention Because the causes of CP are varied, a broad range of preventive interventions have been investigated. Electronic fetal monitoring has not helped to prevent CP, and in 2014 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada have acknowledged that there are no long-term benefits of electronic fetal monitoring. Prior to this, electronic fetal monitoring was widely used to prop up obstetric litigation. In those at risk of an early delivery, magnesium sulphate appears to decrease the risk of cerebral palsy. It is unclear if it helps those who are born at term. In those at high risk of preterm labor a review found that moderate to severe CP was reduced by the administration of magnesium sulphate, and that adverse effects on the babies from the magnesium sulphate were not significant. Mothers who received magnesium sulphate could experience side effects such as respiratory depression and nausea. However, guidelines for the use of magnesium sulfate in mothers at risk of preterm labour are not strongly adhered to. Caffeine is used to treat apnea of prematurity and reduces the risk of cerebral palsy in premature babies, but there are also concerns of long term negative effects. A moderate quality level of evidence indicates that giving women antibiotics during preterm labor before her membranes have ruptured (water is not yet not broken) may increase the risk of cerebral palsy for the child. Additionally, for preterm babies for whom there is a chance of fetal compromise, allowing the birth to proceed rather than trying to delay the birth may lead to an increased risk of cerebral palsy in the child. Corticosteroids are sometimes taken by pregnant women expecting a preterm birth to provide neuroprotection to their baby. Taking corticosteroids during pregnancy is shown to have no significant correlation with developing cerebral palsy in preterm births. Cooling high-risk full-term babies shortly after birth may reduce disability, but this may only be useful for some forms of the brain damage that causes CP. Management Researchers are developing an electrical stimulation device specifically for children with cerebral palsy, who have foot drop, which causes tripping when walking. Over time, the approach to CP management has shifted away from narrow attempts to fix individual physical problems such as spasticity in a particular limb to making such treatments part of a larger goal of maximizing the person's independence and community engagement. However, the evidence base for the effectiveness of intervention programs reflecting the philosophy of independence has not yet caught up: effective interventions for body structures and functions have a strong evidence base, but evidence is lacking for effective interventions targeted toward participation, environment, or personal factors. There is also no good evidence to show that an intervention that is effective at the body-specific level will result in an improvement at the activity level, or vice versa. Although such cross-over benefit might happen, not enough high-quality studies have been done to demonstrate it. Because cerebral palsy has \\"varying severity and complexity\\" across the lifespan, it can be considered a collection of conditions for management purposes. A multidisciplinary approach for cerebral palsy management is recommended, focusing on \\"maximising individual function, choice and independence\\" in line with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health's goals. The team may include a paediatrician, a health visitor, a social worker, a physiotherapist, an orthotist, a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, a teacher specialising in helping children with visual impairment, an educational psychologist, an orthopaedic surgeon, a neurologist and a neurosurgeon. Various forms of therapy are available to people living with cerebral palsy as well as caregivers and parents. Treatment may include one or more of the following: physical therapy; occupational therapy; speech therapy; water therapy; drugs to control seizures, alleviate pain, or relax muscle spasms (e.g. benzodiazepines); surgery to correct anatomical abnormalities or release tight muscles; braces and other orthotic devices; rolling walkers; and communication aids such as computers with attached voice synthesisers. A Cochrane review published in 2004 found a trend toward benefit of speech and language therapy for children with cerebral palsy, but noted the need for high quality research. A 2013 systematic review found that many of the therapies used to treat CP have no good evidence base; the treatments with the best evidence are medications (anticonvulsants, botulinum toxin, bisphosphonates, diazepam), therapy (bimanual training, casting, constraint-induced movement therapy, context-focused therapy, fitness training, goal-directed training, hip surveillance, home programmes, occupational therapy after botulinum toxin, pressure care) and surgery. Surgical intervention in CP children mainly includes orthopaedic surgery and neurosurgery (selective dorsal rhizotomy). Prognosis CP is not a progressive disorder (meaning the brain damage does not worsen), but the symptoms can become more severe over time. A person with the disorder may improve somewhat during childhood if he or she receives extensive care, but once bones and musculature become more established, orthopedic surgery may be required. People with CP can have varying degrees of cognitive impairment or none whatsoever. The full intellectual potential of a child born with CP is often not known until the child starts school. People with CP are more likely to have learning disorders, but have normal intelligence. Intellectual level among people with CP varies from genius to intellectually disabled, as it does in the general population, and experts have stated that it is important not to underestimate the capabilities of a person with CP and to give them every opportunity to learn. The ability to live independently with CP varies widely, depending partly on the severity of each person's impairment and partly on the capability of each person to self- manage the logistics of life. Some individuals with CP require personal assistant services for all activities of daily living. Others only need assistance with certain activities, and still others do not require any physical assistance. But regardless of the severity of a person's physical impairment, a person's ability to live independently often depends primarily on the person's capacity to manage the physical realities of his or her life autonomously. In some cases, people with CP recruit, hire, and manage a staff of personal care assistants (PCAs). PCAs facilitate the independence of their employers by assisting them with their daily personal needs in a way that allows them to maintain control over their lives. Puberty in young adults with cerebral palsy may be precocious or delayed. Delayed puberty is thought to be a consequence of nutritional deficiencies. There is currently no evidence that CP affects fertility, although some of the secondary symptoms have been shown to affect sexual desire and performance. Adults with CP were less likely to get routine reproductive health screening as of 2005. Gynecological examinations may have to be performed under anesthesia due to spasticity, and equipment is often not accessible. Breast self-examination may be difficult, so partners or carers may have to perform it. Women with CP reported higher levels of spasticity and urinary incontinence during menstruation in a study. Men with CP have higher levels of cryptorchidism at the age of 21. CP can significantly reduce a person's life expectancy, depending on the severity of their condition and the quality of care they receive. 5-10% of children with CP die in childhood, particularly where seizures and intellectual disability also affect the child. The ability to ambulate, roll, and self-feed has been associated with increased life expectancy. While there is a lot of variation in how CP affects people, it has been found that \\"independent gross motor functional ability is a very strong determinant of life expectancy\\". According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 2014, 104 Australians died of cerebral palsy.Australian Bureau of Statistics 2014, 3303.0 - Causes of Death, Australia - 1. Underlying causes of death (Australia), 2014, data cube: Excel spreadsheet, http://abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3303.02014?OpenDocument The most common causes of death in CP are related to respiratory causes, but in middle age cardiovascular issues and neoplastic disorders become more prominent. =Self-care= For many children with CP, parents are heavily involved in self-care activities. Self-care activities, such as bathing, dressing, grooming, can be difficult for children with CP, as self-care depends primarily on use of the upper limbs. For those living with CP, impaired upper limb function affects almost 50% of children and is considered the main factor contributing to decreased activity and participation. As the hands are used for many self-care tasks, sensory and motor impairments of the hands make daily self-care more difficult. Motor impairments cause more problems than sensory impairments. The most common impairment is that of finger dexterity, which is the ability to manipulate small objects with the fingers. Compared to other disabilities, people with cerebral palsy generally need more help in performing daily tasks.Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2006. Therapy and equipment needs of people with cerebral palsy and like disabilities in Australia. Disability Series. Cat. no. DIS 49. Canberra: AIHW. Occupational therapists are healthcare professionals that help individuals with disabilities gain or regain their independence through the use of meaningful activities. =Productivity = The effects of sensory, motor and cognitive impairments affect self-care occupations in children with CP and productivity occupations. Productivity can include, but is not limited to, school, work, household chores or contributing to the community. Play is included as a productive occupation as it is often the primary activity for children. If play becomes difficult due to a disability, like CP, this can cause problems for the child. These difficulties can affect a child's self- esteem. In addition, the sensory and motor problems experienced by children with CP affect how the child interacts with their surroundings, including the environment and other people. Not only do physical limitations affect a child's ability to play, the limitations perceived by the child's caregivers and playmates also affect the child's play activities. Some children with disabilities spend more time playing by themselves. When a disability prevents a child from playing, there may be social, emotional and psychological problems, which can lead to increased dependence on others, less motivation, and poor social skills. In school, students are asked to complete many tasks and activities, many of which involve handwriting. Many children with CP have the capacity to learn and write in the school environment. However, students with CP may find it difficult to keep up with the handwriting demands of school and their writing may be difficult to read. In addition, writing may take longer and require greater effort on the student's part. Factors linked to handwriting include postural stability, sensory and perceptual abilities of the hand, and writing tool pressure. Speech impairments may be seen in children with CP depending on the severity of brain damage. Communication in a school setting is important because communicating with peers and teachers is very much a part of the \\"school experience\\" and enhances social interaction. Problems with language or motor dysfunction can lead to underestimating a student's intelligence. In summary, children with CP may experience difficulties in school, such as difficulty with handwriting, carrying out school activities, communicating verbally and interacting socially. =Leisure= Leisure activities can have several positive effects on physical health, mental health, life satisfaction and psychological growth for people with physical disabilities like CP. Common benefits identified are stress reduction, development of coping skills, companionship, enjoyment, relaxation and a positive effect on life satisfaction. In addition, for children with CP, leisure appears to enhance adjustment to living with a disability. Leisure can be divided into structured (formal) and unstructured (informal) activities. Children and teens with CP engage in less habitual physical activity than their peers. Children with CP primarily engage in physical activity through therapies aimed at managing their CP, or through organized sport for people with disabilities. It is difficult to sustain behavioural change in terms of increasing physical activity of children with CP. Gender, manual dexterity, the child's preferences, cognitive impairment and epilepsy were found to affect children's leisure activities, with manual dexterity associated with more leisure activity. Although leisure is important for children with CP, they may have difficulties carrying out leisure activities due to social and physical barriers. Children with cerebral palsy may face challenges when it comes to participating in sports. This comes with being discouraged from physical activity because of these perceived limitations imposed by their medical condition. =Participation and barriers= Participation is involvement in life situations and everyday activities. Participation includes self-care, productivity, and leisure. In fact, communication, mobility, education, home life, leisure and social relationships require participation, and indicate the extent to which children function in their environment. Barriers can exist on three levels: micro, meso and macro. First, the barriers at the micro level involve the person. Barriers at the micro level include the child's physical limitations (motor, sensory and cognitive impairments) or their subjective feelings regarding their ability to participate. For example, the child may not participate in group activities due to lack of confidence. Second, barriers at the meso level include the family and community. These may include negative attitudes of people toward disability or lack of support within the family or in the community. One of the main reasons for this limited support appears to be the result of a lack of awareness and knowledge regarding the child's ability to engage in activities despite his or her disability. Third, barriers at the macro level incorporate the systems and policies that are not in place or hinder children with CP. These may be environmental barriers to participation such as architectural barriers, lack of relevant assistive technology and transportation difficulties due to limited wheelchair access or public transit that can accommodate children with CP. For example, a building without an elevator can prevent the child from accessing higher floors. A 2013 review stated that outcomes for adults with cerebral palsy without intellectual disability in the 2000s were that \\"60‚Äì80% completed high school, 14‚Äì25% completed college, up to 61% were living independently in the community, 25‚Äì55% were competitively employed, and 14‚Äì28% were involved in long term relationships with partners or had established families\\". Adults with cerebral palsy may not seek physical therapy due to transport issues, financial restrictions and practitioners not feeling like they know enough about cerebral palsy to take people with CP on as clients. A study in young adults (18‚Äì34) on transitioning to adulthood found that their concerns were physical health care and understanding their bodies, being able to navigate and use services and supports successfully, and dealing with prejudices. A feeling of being \\"thrust into adulthood\\" was common in the study. =Aging= Children with CP may not successfully transition into using adult services because they are not referred to one upon turning 18, and may decrease their use of services. Because children with cerebral palsy are often told that it is a non-progressive disease, they may be unprepared for the greater effects of the aging process as they head into their 30s.Turk, M.A., Overeynder, J.C., & Janicki, M.P. (Eds.). (1995). Uncertain Future ‚Äì Aging and Cerebral Palsy: Clinical Concerns. Albany: New York State Developmental Disabilities Planning Council. Young adults with cerebral palsy experience problems with aging that able-bodied adults experience \\"much later in life\\". 25% or more adults with cerebral palsy who can walk experience increasing difficulties walking with age. Hand function does not seem to suffer similar declines. Chronic disease risk, such as obesity, is also higher among adults with cerebral palsy than the general population. Common problems include increased pain, reduced flexibility, increased spasms and contractures, post- impairment syndrome and increasing problems with balance. Increased fatigue is also a problem. When adulthood and cerebral palsy is discussed, , it is not discussed in terms of the different stages of adulthood. Like they did in childhood, adults with cerebral palsy experience psychosocial issues related to their CP, chiefly the need for social support, self-acceptance, and acceptance by others. Workplace accommodations may be needed to enhance continued employment for adults with CP as they age. Rehabilitation or social programs that include salutogenesis may improve the coping potential of adults with CP as they age. Epidemiology Cerebral palsy occurs in about 2.1 per 1000 live births. In those born at term rates are lower at 1 per 1000 live births. Rates appear to be similar in both the developing and developed world. Within a population it may occur more often in poorer people. The rate is higher in males than in females; in Europe it is 1.3 times more common in males. There was a \\"moderate, but significant\\" rise in the prevalence of CP between the 1970s and 1990s. This is thought to be due to a rise in low birth weight of infants and the increased survival rate of these infants. The increased survival rate of infants with CP in the 1970s and 80s may be indirectly due to the disability rights movement challenging perspectives around the worth of infants with disability, as well as the Baby Doe Law. As of 2005, advances in care of pregnant mothers and their babies has not resulted in a noticeable decrease in CP. This is generally attributed to medical advances in areas related to the care of premature babies (which results in a greater survival rate). Only the introduction of quality medical care to locations with less-than-adequate medical care has shown any decreases. The incidence of CP increases with premature or very low-weight babies regardless of the quality of care. , there is a suggestion that both incidence and severity are slightly decreasing ‚Äì more research is needed to find out if this is significant, and if so, which interventions are effective. Prevalence of cerebral palsy is best calculated around the school entry age of about 6 years, the prevalence in the U.S. is estimated to be 2.4 out of 1000 children. History Cerebral palsy has affected humans since antiquity. A decorated grave marker dating from around the 15th to 14th century BCE shows a figure with one small leg and using a crutch, possibly due to cerebral palsy. The oldest likely physical evidence of the condition comes from the mummy of Siptah, an Egyptian Pharaoh who ruled from about 1196 to 1190 BCE and died at about 20 years of age. The presence of cerebral palsy has been suspected due to his deformed foot and hands. The medical literature of the ancient Greeks discusses paralysis and weakness of the arms and legs; the modern word palsy comes from the Ancient Greek words œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨ŒªœÖœÉŒ∑ or œÄŒ¨œÅŒµœÉŒ∑, meaning paralysis or paresis respectively. The works of the school of Hippocrates (460c. 370 BCE), and the manuscript On the Sacred Disease in particular, describe a group of problems that matches up very well with the modern understanding of cerebral palsy. The Roman Emperor Claudius (10 BCE54 CE) is suspected of having CP, as historical records describe him as having several physical problems in line with the condition. Medical historians have begun to suspect and find depictions of CP in much later art. Several paintings from the 16th century and later show individuals with problems consistent with it, such as Jusepe de Ribera's 1642 painting The Clubfoot. The modern understanding of CP as resulting from problems within the brain began in the early decades of the 1800s with a number of publications on brain abnormalities by Johann Christian Reil, Claude Fran√ßois Lallemand and Philippe Pinel. Later physicians used this research to connect problems in the brain with specific symptoms. The English surgeon William John Little (18101894) was the first person to study CP extensively. In his doctoral thesis he stated that CP was a result of a problem around the time of birth. He later identified a difficult delivery, a preterm birth and perinatal asphyxia in particular as risk factors. The spastic diplegia form of CP came to be known as Little's disease. At around this time, a German surgeon was also working on cerebral palsy, and distinguished it from polio. In the 1880s British neurologist William Gowers built on Little's work by linking paralysis in newborns to difficult births. He named the problem \\"birth palsy\\" and classified birth palsies into two types: peripheral and cerebral. Working in Pennsylvania in the 1880s, Canadian-born physician William Osler (18491919) reviewed dozens of CP cases to further classify the disorders by the site of the problems on the body and by the underlying cause. Osler made further observations tying problems around the time of delivery with CP, and concluded that problems causing bleeding inside the brain were likely the root cause. Osler also suspected polioencephalitis as an infectious cause. Through the 1890s, scientists commonly confused CP with polio. Before moving to psychiatry, Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud (18561939) made further refinements to the classification of the disorder. He produced the system still being used today. Freud's system divides the causes of the disorder into problems present at birth, problems that develop during birth, and problems after birth. Freud also made a rough correlation between the location of the problem inside the brain and the location of the affected limbs on the body, and documented the many kinds of movement disorders. In the early 20th century, the attention of the medical community generally turned away from CP until orthopedic surgeon Winthrop Phelps became the first physician to treat the disorder. He viewed CP from a musculoskeletal perspective instead of a neurological one. Phelps developed surgical techniques for operating on the muscles to address issues such as spasticity and muscle rigidity. Hungarian physical rehabilitation practitioner Andr√°s Pet≈ë developed a system to teach children with CP how to walk and perform other basic movements. Pet≈ë's system became the foundation for conductive education, widely used for children with CP today. Through the remaining decades, physical therapy for CP has evolved, and has become a core component of the CP management program. In 1997, Robert Palisano et al. introduced the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) as an improvement over the previous rough assessment of limitation as either mild, moderate or severe. The GMFCS grades limitation based on observed proficiency in specific basic mobility skills such as sitting, standing and walking, and takes into account the level of dependency on aids such as wheelchairs or walkers. The GMFCS was further revised and expanded in 2007. Society and culture =Economic impact= It is difficult to directly compare the cost and cost-effectiveness of interventions to prevent cerebral palsy or the cost of interventions to manage CP. Access Economics has released a report on the economic impact of cerebral palsy in Australia. The report found that, in 2007, the financial cost of cerebral palsy (CP) in Australia was $AUS 1.47 billion or 0.14% of GDP. Of this: * $AUS 1.03 billion (69.9%) was productivity lost due to lower employment, absenteeism and premature death of Australians with CP * $AUS 141 million (9.6%) was the DWL from transfers including welfare payments and taxation forgone * $AUS 131 million (9.0%) was other indirect costs such as direct program services, aides and home modifications and the bringing-forward of funeral costs * $AUS 129 million (8.8%) was the value of the informal care for people with CP * $AUS 40 million (2.8%) was direct health system expenditure The value of lost well-being (disability and premature death) was a further $AUS 2.4 billion. In per capita terms, this amounts to a financial cost of $AUS 43,431 per person with CP per annum. Including the value of lost well-being, the cost is over $115,000 per person per annum. Individuals with CP bear 37% of the financial costs, and their families and friends bear a further 6%. Federal government bears around one- third (33%) of the financial costs (mainly through taxation revenues forgone and welfare payments). State governments bear under 1% of the costs, while employers bear 5% and the rest of society bears the remaining 19%. If the burden of disease (lost well-being) is included, individuals bear 76% of the costs. The average lifetime cost for people with CP in the US is $US921,000 per individual, including lost income. In the United States many states allow Medicaid beneficiaries to use their Medicaid funds to hire their own PCAs, instead of forcing them to use institutional or managed care. In India, the government-sponsored program called \\"NIRAMAYA\\" for the medical care of children with neurological and muscular deformities has proved to be an ameliorating economic measure for persons with such disabilities. It has shown that persons with mental or physically debilitating congenital disabilities can lead better lives if they have financial independence. =Use of the term= \\"Cerebral\\" means \\"of, or pertaining to, the cerebrum or the brain\\" and \\"palsy\\" means \\"paralysis, generally partial, whereby a local body area is incapable of voluntary movement\\". It has been proposed to change the name to \\"cerebral palsy spectrum disorder\\" to reflect the diversity of presentations of CP. Many people would rather be referred to as a person with a disability (people-first language) instead of as handicapped. \\"Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Care\\" at the University of Delaware offers the following guidelines: The term \\"spastic\\" denotes the attribute of spasticity in types of spastic CP. In 1952 a UK charity called The Spastics Society was formed. The term \\"spastics\\" was used by the charity as a term for people with CP. The word \\"spastic\\" has since been used extensively as a general insult to disabled people, which some see as extremely offensive. They are also frequently used to insult able- bodied people when they seem overly uncoordinated, anxious, or unskilled in sports. The charity changed its name to Scope in 1994. In the United States the word spaz has the same usage as an insult, but is not generally associated with CP. =Media= Maverick documentary filmmaker Kazuo Hara criticises the mores and customs of Japanese society in an unsentimental portrait of adults with cerebral palsy in his 1972 film Goodbye CP (Sayonara CP). Focusing on how people with cerebral palsy are generally ignored or disregarded in Japan, Hara challenges his society's taboos about physical handicaps. Using a deliberately harsh style, with grainy black-and-white photography and out-of-sync sound, Hara brings a stark realism to his subject. Spandan (2012), a film by Vegitha Reddy and Aman Tripathi, delves into the dilemma of parents whose child has cerebral palsy. While films made with children with special needs as central characters have been attempted before, the predicament of parents dealing with the stigma associated with the condition and beyond is dealt in Spandan. In one of the songs of Spandan \\"Chal chaal chaal tu bala\\" more than 50 CP kids have acted. The famous classical singer Devaki Pandit has given her voice to the song penned by Prof. Jayant Dhupkar and composed by National Film Awards winner Isaac Thomas Kottukapally. My Left Foot (1989) is a drama film directed by Jim Sheridan and starring Daniel Day-Lewis. It tells the true story of Christy Brown, an Irishman born with cerebral palsy, who could control only his left foot. Christy Brown grew up in a poor, working-class family, and became a writer and artist. It won the Academy Award for Best Actor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Brenda Fricker). It was also nominated for Best Director, Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. It also won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film for 1989. Call the Midwife (2012‚Äì) has featured two episodes with actor Colin Young, who he himself has cerebral palsy, playing a character with the same disability. His story lines have focused on the segregation of those with disabilities in the UK in the 1950s, and also romantic relationships between people with disabilities. Micah Fowler, an American actor with CP, stars in the ABC sitcom Speechless (2016‚Äì19), which explores both the serious and humorous challenges a family faces with a teenager with CP.

In the latter half of the 20th century, obstetric litigation about the cause of cerebral palsy became more common, leading to the practice of defensive medicine.

These are the four motor symptoms found in Parkinson's disease (PD), after which it is named, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), and many other conditions. A wide range of causes may lead to this set of symptoms, including neurodegenerative conditions, drugs, toxins, metabolic diseases, and neurological conditions other than PD.  Causes  =Drug-induced= About 7% of people with parkinsonism developed symptoms as a result of side effects of medications, mainly neuroleptic antipsychotics especially the phenothiazines (such as perphenazine and chlorpromazine), thioxanthenes (such as flupenthixol and zuclopenthixol) and butyrophenones (such as haloperidol), and rarely, antidepressants. The incidence of drug-induced parkinsonism increases with age. Drug-induced parkinsonism tends to remain at its presenting level and does not worsen like Parkinson's disease. = Toxins = Evidence exists of a link between exposure to pesticides and herbicides and PD; a two-fold increase in risk was seen with paraquat or maneb/mancozeb exposure. Chronic manganese (Mn) exposure has been shown to produce a parkinsonism-like illness characterized by movement abnormalities. This condition is not responsive to typical therapies used in the treatment of PD, suggesting an alternative pathway than the typical dopaminergic loss within the substantia nigra. Manganese may accumulate in the basal ganglia, leading to the abnormal movements. A mutation of the SLC30A10 gene, a manganese efflux transporter necessary for decreasing intracellular Mn, has been linked with the development of this Parkinsonism-like disease. The Lewy bodies typical to PD are not seen in Mn-induced parkinsonism.

He was the oldest pope (reigning until the age of 93), with the exception of Pope Benedict XVI as emeritus pope, and had the third-longest confirmed pontificate, behind those of Pius IX (his immediate predecessor) and John Paul II. He is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical Rerum novarum, Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of trade unions, while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both socialism and laissez-faire capitalism. He influenced Mariology of the Catholic Church and promoted both the rosary and the scapular. Leo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the rosary, earning him the title as the \\"Rosary Pope\\". In addition, he approved two new Marian scapulars and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as Mediatrix. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the Papal States, after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the Basilica of Saint John Lateran.  Early life and education, 1810‚Äì1836  The house in Carpineto Romano in which the Pecci brothers grew up Born in Carpineto Romano, near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife, Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included Giuseppe and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818, he lived at home with his family \\"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity.\\" Together with Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in Viterbo, where he stayed until 1824. He enjoyed Latin and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven. In 1824, he and Giuseppe were called to Rome, where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife and so they stayed with him in Rome and attended the Jesuit Collegium Romanum. In 1828, the 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of secular clergy, and Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order. Vincenzo studied at the Academia dei Nobili, mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several cardinals, on papal judgments. For his presentation, he received awards for academic excellence and gained the attention of Vatican officials. Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Lambruschini introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome, he assisted Cardinal Sala in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals. In 1836, he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and Canon Law in Rome. Provincial administrator, 1837‚Äì1843 Illustration of the Carpineto Romano as seen in 1860 On 14 February 1837, Pope Gregory XVI appointed the 27-year-old Pecci as personal prelate even before he was ordained a priest on 31 December 1837 by the Vicar of Rome, Cardinal Carlo Odescalchi. He celebrated his first Mass with his priest brother Giuseppe. Shortly thereafter, Gregory XVI appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to Benevento, the smallest papal province, with a population of about 20,000. The main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity from widespread bandits, and pervasive Mafia or Camorra structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with the neighboring provinces. Pecci was first destined for Spoleto, a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to Perugia with 200,000 inhabitants. His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor. Nuncio to Belgium, 1843 Nuncio in Brussels In 1843, Pecci, at only 33, was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium,Miranda, Salvador. \\"Pecci, Gioacchino\\", The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church a position that guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour. On 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci Archbishop and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him. Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighboring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the Cologne Cathedral. In 1844, upon his initiative, a Belgian College in Rome was opened; 102 years later, in 1946, the future Pope John Paul II would begin his Roman studies there. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop Nicholas Wiseman, carefully reviewing the condition of the Catholic Church in that country. In Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the liberal minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, but he was able to win the good will of the Court not only of the pious Queen Louise but also of King Leopold I, who was strongly liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the Order of Leopold.Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910 Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846‚Äì1878 =Papal assistant= Archbishop Pecci enters Perugia in 1846 In 1843, Pecci had been named papal assistant. From 1846 to 1877, he was considered a popular and successful Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia. In 1847, after Pope Pius IX granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,K√ºhne 62 Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence. In 1848, revolutionary movements developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity. =Provincial council= Pecci called a provincial council to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably Thomists. He called on his brother Giuseppe Pecci, a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and to teach in Perugia instead. His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students. =Charitable activities= Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia Pecci developed several activities in support of Catholic charities. He founded homeless shelters for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses, he opened branches of a Bank, Monte di Piet√†, which focused on low-income people and provided low-interest loans. He created soup kitchens, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals, as Cardinal-Priest of S. Crisogono. In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the Papal States and Italian nationalism, which aimed at the Papal States' annihilation to achieve the Unification of Italy. =Defending papacy= Pecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to nontheologians. The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation according to which all episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication. =Organizing First Vatican Council= On 8 December 1869, an ecumenical council, which became known as the First Vatican Council, was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event. During the 1870s, in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as the mother of material civilization because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization and developed large-scale charities for the needy. In August 1877, on the death of Cardinal Filippo de Angelis, Pope Pius IX appointed him Camerlengo, which required him to reside in Rome. =1878 papal conclave= Pope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878, and during his closing years the liberal press had often insinuated that the Kingdom of Italy should take a hand in the conclave and occupy the Vatican. However the Russo- Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) and the sudden death of Victor Emmanuel II (9 January 1878) distracted the government's attention. In the conclave, the cardinals faced varied questions and discussed issues like church‚Äìstate relations in Europe, specifically Italy; divisions in the church and the status of the First Vatican Council. It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878, the conclave assembled in Rome. Cardinal Pecci was elected on the third ballot and chose the name Leo XIII. He was announced to the people and later crowned on 3 March 1878. He retained the administration of the Perugia see until 1880.

Photograph of Leo XIII in his later years. As soon as he was elected to the papacy, Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world. When he firmly reasserted the scholastic doctrine that science and religion coexist, he required the study of Thomas Aquinas. and opened the Vatican Secret Archives to qualified researchers, among whom was the noted historian of the Papacy Ludwig von Pastor. He also refounded the Vatican Observatory \\"so that everyone might see clearly that the Church and her Pastors are not opposed to true and solid science, whether human or divine, but that they embrace it, encourage it, and promote it with the fullest possible devotion.\\". Leo XIII was the first Pope of whose voice a sound recording was made. The recording can be found on a compact disc of Alessandro Moreschi's singing; a recording of his praying of the Ave Maria is available on the Web.. He was also the first Pope to be filmed by a motion picture camera. He was filmed by its inventor, W. K. Dickson, and blessed the camera while being filmed.. Leo XIII brought normality back to the Church after the tumultuous years of Pius IX. Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anticlerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse that trend. Although Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy moved the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries. Pope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the fifth cholera pandemic in 1891, he ordered the construction of a hospice inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the Domus Sanctae Marthae. Leo was a drinker of the cocaine-infused wine tonic Vin Mariani. He awarded a Vatican gold medal to the wine's creator, Angelo Mariani, and also appeared on a poster endorsing it. Leo XIII was a semi-vegetarian. In 1903, he attributed his longevity to the sparing use of meat and the consumption of eggs, milk and vegetables.The Elusive Secret of Long Life. Arizona Republican. (March 9, 1903). p. 2 His favourite poets were Virgil and Dante. \\"Pope Leo XIII and his Household\\" in The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine, p. 596 =Foreign relations= Depiction of Leo XIII's papal coronation ‚Äì image circa 1900. Russia Pope Leo XIII began his pontificate with a friendly letter to Tsar Alexander II in which he reminded the Russian monarch of the millions of Catholics living in his empire who would like to be good Russian subjects if their dignity were respected. After the assassination of Alexander II, the Pope sent a high ranking representative to the coronation of his successor, Alexander III, who was grateful and asked for all religious forces to unify. He asked the Pope to ensure that his bishops abstain from political agitation. Relations improved further when Pope Leo XIII, because of Italian considerations, distanced the Vatican from the Rome-Vienna-Berlin alliance, and helped to facilitate a rapprochement between Paris and St. Petersburg. Germany Under Otto von Bismarck, the anti-Catholic Kulturkampf in Prussia led to significant restrictions on the Catholic Church in Imperial Germany, including the Jesuits Law of 1872. During Leo's papacy, compromises were informally reached and the anti-Catholic attacks subsided. The Centre Party in Germany represented Catholic interests and was a force for social change. It was encouraged by Leo's support for social welfare legislation and the rights of working people. Leo's forward-looking approach encouraged Catholic Action in other European countries, where the social teachings of the Church were incorporated into the agenda of Catholic parties, particularly the Christian democratic parties, which became an acceptable alternative to socialist parties. Leo's social teachings were reiterated throughout the 20th century by his successors. In his Memoirs Kaiser Wilhelm II discussed the \\"friendly, trustful relationship that existed between me and Pope Leo XIII.\\" During Wilhelm's third visit to Leo: \\"It was of interest to me that the Pope said on this occasion that Germany must be the sword of the Catholic Church. I remarked that the old Roman Empire of the German nation no longer existed, and that conditions had changed. But he adhered to his words.\\" France Leo XIII was the first pope to come out strongly in favour of the French Republic, upsetting many French monarchists. Italy In the light of a climate hostile to the Church, Leo continued the policies of Pius IX towards Italy without major modifications. In his relations with the Italian state, Leo continued the Papacy's self-imposed incarceration in the Vatican stance and continued to insist that Italian Catholics should not vote in Italian elections or hold any elected office. In his first consistory in 1879, he elevated his older brother, Giuseppe, to the cardinalate. He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the Tiber on 13 July 1881. The Pope even considered moving his residence to Trieste or Salzburg, two cities in Austria, an idea that Emperor Franz Joseph I gently rejected. United Kingdom Among the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he restored the Scottish hierarchy in 1878. The following year, on 12 May 1879, he raised to the rank of cardinal the convert clergyman John Henry Newman, who would eventually be beatified by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010 and canonized by Pope Francis in 2019. In British India, too, Leo established a Catholic hierarchy in 1886 and regulated some longstanding conflicts with the Portuguese authorities. A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Irish Plan of Campaign and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the papal encyclical \\"Saepe Nos\\". that was addressed to all the Irish bishops. Of outstanding significance, not least for the English-speaking world, was Leo's encyclical Apostolicae curae on the invalidity of the Anglican orders, published in 1896. In 1899, he declared St Bede the Venerable a Doctor of the Church. Bulgaria Leo XIII welcomed the elevation of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg to the Bulgarian Principality in 1886. A fellow Catholic, whose wife is a member the Italian house of Bourbon-Parma, the two had a lot in common. However, relations between the two greatly soured when Ferdinand expressed his intentions to convert his eldest son Crown Prince Boris (later Tsar Boris III) to Orthodoxy, the majority religion of Bulgaria. Leo strongly condemned the action, and when Ferdinand went through with the conversion anyway, Leo excommunicated him. United States In 1889, Pope Leo XIII authorized the founding of The Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, and granted it Papal degrees in theology The United States frequently attracted his attention and admiration. He confirmed the decrees of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore (1884) and raised James Gibbons, the archbishop of that city, to the cardinalate in 1886. On 10 April 1887, a pontifical charter from Pope Leo XIII founded The Catholic University of America, establishing the national university of the Catholic Church in the United States. American newspapers criticized Pope Leo because they claimed that he was attempting to gain control of American public schools. One cartoonist drew Leo as a fox unable to reach grapes that were labeled for American schools; the caption read \\"Sour grapes!\\" Brazil Pope Leo XIII is also remembered for the First Plenary Council of Latin America held at Rome in 1899, and for his encyclical of 1888 to the bishops of Brazil, In plurimis, on the abolition of slavery. In 1897 he published the Apostolic Letter Trans Oceanum, which dealt with the privileges and ecclesiastical structure of the Catholic Church in Latin America. Chile During the War of the Pacific, he gave the papal blessing to the Chilean troops on the eve of the Battle of Chorrillos in January 1881; after the battle, in the resulting chaos, there was extensive looting in the city from Chilean troops as well as Peruvians, with the Chileans carrying many old Bibles to their churches.. However, one year later, Chilean President Domingo Santa Mar√≠a, a member of the Liberal Party in defiance of the opposition, the fiercely-Catholic Conservative Party, issued the Leyes Laicas (Laic Laws), which reduced the faculties of the church over state and society, though it was not until 1925 that President Arturo Alessandri, also from the Liberal Party separated the church from the state. India Pope Leo XIII urged \\"Filii tui India, administri tibi salutis\\" (Your own sons, O India, will be the heralds of your salvation)http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE06363041 and founded the national seminary, called Papal Seminary. He entrusted this task to the then Apostolic Delegae to Indian Ladislaus Michael Zaleski, who founded the Seminary in 1893. Evangelization Pope Leo XIII sanctioned the missions to Eastern Africa beginning in 1884. In 1879 Catholic missionaries associated with the White Father Congregation (Society of the Missionaries of Africa) came to Uganda and others went to Tanganyika (present day Tanzania) and Rwanda. In 1887, he approved the foundation of Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo, which were organized by the Bishop of Piacenza, Giovanni Battista Scalabrini. The missionaries were sent to North and South America to do pastoral care for Italian immigrants. =Theology= Giuseppe Pecci in 1872. At the urgent requests of the College of Cardinals, Leo XIII in 1879 elevated his brother, Giuseppe Pecci, a Jesuit and prominent Thomist theologian, into their ranks.. The pontificate of Leo XIII was theologically influenced by the First Vatican Council (1869‚Äì1870), which had ended only eight years earlier. Leo XIII issued some 46 apostolic letters and encyclicals dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the intercession of Michael the Archangel after he allegedly had a vision of Michael and the end times, but the story of the alleged vision may be merely apocryphal, as historians note that the story does not appear in any of his writings. Leo XIII also approved a number of Scapulars. In 1885, he approved the Scapular of the Holy Face, (also known as The Veronica) and elevated the Priests of the Holy Face to an archconfraternity.Henry Charles Lea, 2002, A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church, Adamant Media Corp. page 506 He also approved the Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel and the Scapular of St. Joseph, both in 1893, and the Scapular of the Sacred Heart in 1900.Francis de Zulueta, 2008, Early Steps In The Fold, Miller Press, page 317 Thomism As pope, he used all his authority for a revival of Thomism, the theology of Thomas Aquinas. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical Aeterni Patris (\\"Eternal Father\\"), which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism, the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas ‚Äì as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities. Pope Leo XIII then created the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called Leonine Edition, of the complete works of the doctor angelicus. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to Tommaso Maria Zigliara, professor and rector of the Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. Leo XIII also founded the Angelicum's Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of Canon Law in 1896. Consecrations Sister Mary of the Divine Heart was a religious sister from the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.. Pope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he had received many letters from Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, the countess of Droste zu Vischering and Mother Superior in the Convent of the Good Shepherd Sisters in Porto, Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive and so in the encyclical letter Annum sacrum (on 25 May 1899), he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899. The encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the First Friday Devotions, established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart.. His consecration of the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and countries had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, the consecration was made throughout the Catholic world. Scriptures In his 1893 encyclical Providentissimus Deus, he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out 50 years later in his encyclical Divino Afflante Spiritu.. Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches Pope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the Eastern Rite Churches and stated that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed that in his encyclical \\"Orientalium Dignitas\\" of 1894 and wrote, \\"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\\" Theological research John Henry Newman was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII. Leo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the Vatican Archives and personally fostered a 20-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by Ludwig von Pastor, an Austrian historian.. Mariology His predecessor, Pope Pius IX, became known as the Pope of the Immaculate Conception because of his dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the rosary in 11 encyclicals, was called the Rosary Pope because he promulgated Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the 50th anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses Mary's role in the redemption of humanity and calls her Mediatrix and Co-Redemptrix. While allowing the title \\"Mediatrix\\", recent popes, following on the Second Vatican Council, have warned away from the term \\"co- redemptrix\\" as derogating from the one mediator, Jesus Christ. Social teachings =Church and state= Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, but he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \\"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man.\\" Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth. =Rerum novarum= Charles M. Johnson, Pope Leo XIII, 1899, National Gallery of Art Portrait by Philip de L√°szl√≥, 1900 His encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities; the 1891 encyclical Rerum novarum, for the first time, addressed social inequality and social justice issues with papal authority by focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler, a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum. Since Leo XIII, papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: Pope Pius XI's Quadragesimo anno, the social teachings of Pope Pius XII on a huge range of social issues, John XXIII's Mater et magistra in 1961, Pope Paul VI's Populorum progressio on world development issues, Pope John Paul II's Centesimus annus, commemorating the 100th anniversary of Rerum novarum, and Pope Francis' Laudato si' on the use of the goods of creation. Leo had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. Rerum novarum introduced the idea of subsidiarity, the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought. (See list of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII.) =Canonizations and beatifications= Leo XIII canonized the following saints during his pontificate: * 8 December 1881: Clare of Montefalco (d. 1308), John Baptist de Rossi (1696‚Äì1764), Lawrence of Brindisi (d. 1619), and Benedict Joseph Labre (1748‚Äì1783) * 15 January 1888: Seven Holy Founders of the Servite Order, Peter Claver (1581‚Äì1654), John Berchmans (1599‚Äì1621), and Alphonsus Rodriguez (1531‚Äì1617) * 27 May 1897: Antonio Maria Zaccaria (1502‚Äì1539) and Peter Fourier (1565‚Äì1640) * 24 May 1900: John Baptist de la Salle (1651‚Äì1719) and Rita of Cascia (1381‚Äì1457) Leo XIII beatified several of his predecessors: Urban II (14 July 1881), Victor III (23 July 1887) and Innocent V (9 March 1898). He canonized Adrian III on 2 June 1891. He also beatified the following: * Giancarlo Melchiori on 22 January 1882 * Edmund Campion and Ralph Sherwin in 1886 * John Haile on 29 December 1886 * John Baptist de la Salle (whom he later canonized) on 19 February 1888 * In√©s of Benig√°nim on 26 February 1888 * Antonio Maria Zaccaria (whom he later canonized) on 3 January 1890 * Giovanni Giovenale Ancina on 9 February 1890 * Pompilio Maria Pirrotti on 26 January 1890 * Gerard Majella on 29 January 1893 * Leopoldo Croci on 12 May 1893 * Antonio Baldinucci on 16 April 1893 * Rodolfo Acquaviva and 4 Companions on 30 April 1893 * Diego Jos√© L√≥pez-Caama√±o on 22 April 1894 * Bernardino Realino on 12 January 1896 * Maria Maddalena Martinengo on 3 June 1900 * D√©nis Berthelot of the Nativity and Redento Rodr√≠guez of the Cross on 10 June 1900 * Jeanne de Lestonnac on 23 September 1900 * Antonio Grassi on 30 September 1900 He approved the cult of Cosmas of Aphrodisia. He beatified several of the English martyrs in 1895. Doctors of the Church Leo XIII named four individuals as Doctors of the Church: * Cyril of Alexandria (1883) * Cyril of Jerusalem (1883) * John of Damascus (1890) * Bede the Venerable (13 November 1899) =Audiences= In 1901, Pope Leo XIII welcomed Eugenio Pacelli, later Pope Pius XII, on his first day of 57 years of service in the Vatican (1901‚Äì1958). One of the first audiences that Leo XIII granted was to the professors and students of the Collegio Capranica, where in the first row knelt in front of him the young seminarian Giacomo Della Chiesa, the future Pope Benedict XV, who would reign from 1914 to 1922. On a pilgrimage with her father and sister in 1887, the future Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux attended a general audience with Pope Leo XIII and asked him to allow her to enter the Carmelite order. Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told that it would prolong the audience too much, she wrote in her autobiography, Story of a Soul, that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, \\"Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you. In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\\" Leo XIII answered, \\"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\\" Th√©r√®se replied, \\"Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!\\" Finally, the Pope said, \\"Go... go... You will enter if God wills it\\" [italics hers]. Two guards lifted her (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door, where a third gave her a medal of the Pope. Shortly thereafter, the Bishop of Bayeux authorized the prioress to receive Th√©r√®se, and in April 1888, she entered Carmel at the age of 15. Death The monument and tomb to Leo XIII in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran. Leo XIII was the first pope to be born in the 19th century and was also the first to die in the 20th century: he lived to the age of 93, dying on 20 July 1903,John-Peter Pham, Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession, (Oxford University Press, 2004), 98. the second longest-lived pope ever behind Pope Benedict XVI (). At the time of his death, Leo XIII was the second- longest reigning pope (25 years), exceeded only by his immediate predecessor, Pius IX (31 years). Charles A. Finn, a priest of the Archdiocese of Boston and at his own death the oldest priest in the United States, served as a Mass officer at his funeral. Leo XIII was entombed in Saint Peter's Basilica only very briefly after his funeral, but was later moved instead to the very ancient Basilica of Saint John Lateran, his cathedral church as the Bishop of Rome, and a church in which he took a particular interest. He was moved there in late 1924.

The Scyphozoa are an exclusively marine class of the phylum Cnidaria, referred to as the true jellyfish (or \\"true jellies\\"). It may include the extinct fossil group the Conulariida, whose affinities are uncertain and widely debated. The class name Scyphozoa comes from the Greek word skyphos (œÉŒ∫œçœÜŒøœÇ), denoting a kind of drinking cup and alluding to the cup shape of the organism. Scyphozoans have existed from the earliest Cambrian to the present. Biology Most species of Scyphozoa have two life-history phases, including the planktonic medusa or jellyfish form, which is most evident in the warm summer months, and an inconspicuous, but longer-lived, bottom-dwelling polyp, which seasonally gives rise to new medusae. Most of the large, often colorful, and conspicuous jellyfish found in coastal waters throughout the world are Scyphozoa. They typically range from in diameter, but the largest species, Cyanea capillata can reach across. Scyphomedusae are found throughout the world's oceans, from the surface to great depths; no Scyphozoa occur in freshwater (or on land). As medusae, they eat a variety of crustaceans and fish, which they capture using stinging cells called nematocysts. The nematocysts are located throughout the tentacles that radiate downward from the edge of the umbrella dome, and also cover the four or eight oral arms that hang down from the central mouth. Some species, however, are instead filter feeders, using their tentacles to strain plankton from the water. Anatomy Scyphozoans usually display a four-part symmetry and have an internal gelatinous material called mesoglea, which provides the same structural integrity as a skeleton. The mesoglea includes mobile amoeboid cells originating from the epidermis. Scyphozoans have no durable hard parts, including no head, no skeleton, and no specialized organs for respiration or excretion.Cartwright, P., Halgedahl, S.L., Hendriks, J.R., Jarrad, R.D., Marques, A.C., Collins, A.G., and Lieberman, B.S., 2007, Exceptionally preserved jellyfishes from the Middle Cambrian. PLOSONE Issue 10: e1121, p.1-7.Richards, H.G., 1947, Preservation of fossil jellyfish: Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, v. 58, p. 1221. Marine jellyfish can consist of as much as 98% water, so are rarely found in fossil form. Unlike the hydrozoan jellyfish, Hydromedusae, Scyphomedusae lack a vellum, which is a circular membrane beneath the umbrella that helps propel the (usually smaller) Hydromedusae through the water. However, a ring of muscle fibres is present within the mesoglea around the rim of the dome, and the jellyfish swims by alternately contracting and relaxing these muscles.Morris, M., and Fautin, D., 2001, Animal Diversity Web: University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, \\"Scyphozoa., Accessed: September 28, 2008. The periodic contracting and relaxing propels the jellyfish through the water, allowing it to escape predation or catch its prey. The mouth opens into a central stomach, from which four interconnected diverticula radiate outwards. In many species, this is further elaborated by a system of radial canals, with or without an additional ring canal towards the edge of the dome. Some genera, such as Cassiopea, even have additional, smaller mouths in the oral arms. The lining of the digestive system includes further stinging nematocysts, along with cells that secrete digestive enzymes. The nervous system usually consists of a distributed net of cells, although some species possess more organised nerve rings. In species lacking nerve rings, the nerve cells are instead concentrated into small structures called rhopalia. There are between four and sixteen of these small lobes arranged around the rim of the umbrella, where they coordinate the muscular action allowing the animal to move. Each rhopalium is typically associated with a pair of sensory pits, a statocyst, and sometimes a pigment-cup ocellus. =Reproduction= The developmental stages of alt=Illustration of two life stages of seven jelly species Most species appear to be gonochorists, with separate male and female individuals. The gonads are located in the stomach lining, and the mature gametes are expelled through the mouth. After fertilization, some species brood their young in pouches on the oral arms, but they are more commonly planktonic. =Growth and development= The fertilized egg produces a planular larva which, in most species, quickly attaches itself to the sea bottom. The larva develops into the hydroid stage of the lifecycle, a tiny sessile polyp called a scyphistoma. The scyphistoma reproduces asexually, producing similar polyps by budding, and then either transforming into a medusa, or budding several medusae off from its upper surface via a process called strobilation. The medusae are initially microscopic and may take years to reach sexual maturity. Commercial importance Scyphozoa include the moon jelly Aurelia aurita, in the order Semaeostomeae, and the enormous Nemopilema nomurai, in the order Rhizostomeae, found between Japan and China and which in some years causes major fisheries disruptions. The jellyfish fished commercially for food are Scyphomedusae in the order Rhizostomeae. Most rhizostome jellyfish live in warm water. Taxonomy Although the Scyphozoa were formerly considered to include the animals now referred to as the classes Cubozoa and Staurozoa, they now include just three extant orders (two of which are in Discomedusae, a subclass of Scyphozoa).Daly, Brugler, Cartwright, Collins, Dawson, Fautin, France, McFadden, Opresko, Rodriguez, Romano & Stake (2007).

Cyprus's geographic position has caused Cyprus to be influenced by differing Eastern Mediterranean civilisations over the millennia. Cyprus is a small country. Periods of Cyprus's history from 1050 BC have been named according to styles of pottery found as follows: * Cypro-Geometric I: 1050-950 BC * Cypro- Geometric II: 950-850 BC * Cypro-Geometric III: 850-700 BC * Cypro-Archaic I: 700-600 BC * Cypro-Archaic II: 600-475 BC * Cypro-Classical I: 475-400 BC * Cypro-Classical II: 400-323 BC Prehistoric Cyprus Cypriot cult image. 'Red Polished Ware', 2100‚Äì2000 BC. Museum zu Allerheiligen Cyprus was settled by humans in the Paleolithic period (known as the stone age) who coexisted with various dwarf animal species, such as dwarf elephants (Elephas cypriotes) and pygmy hippos (Hippopotamus minor) well into the Holocene. There are claims of an association of this fauna with artifacts of Epipalaeolithic foragers at Aetokremnos near Limassol on the southern coast of Cyprus. The first undisputed settlement occurred in the 9th (or perhaps 10th) millennium BC from the Levant. The first settlers were agriculturalists of the so-called PPNB (pre-pottery Neolithic B) era, but did not yet produce pottery (aceramic Neolithic). The dog, sheep, goats and possibly cattle and pigs were introduced, as well as numerous wild animals such as foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) that were previously unknown on the island. The PPNB settlers built round houses with floors made of terrazzo of burned lime (e.g. Kastros, Shillourokambos) and cultivated einkorn and emmer. Pigs, sheep, goats and cattle were kept but remained, for the most part, behaviourally wild. Evidence of cattle such as that attested at Shillourokambos is rare, and when they apparently died out in the course of the 8th millennium they were not re-introduced until the ceramic Neolithic. In the 6th millennium BC, the aceramic Khirokitia culture was characterised by roundhouses, stone vessels and an economy based on sheep, goats and pigs. Cattle were unknown, and Persian fallow deer were hunted. This was followed by the ceramic Sotira phase. The Eneolithic era is characterised by stone figurines with spread arms. Khirokitia archeological site. Water wells discovered by archaeologists in western Cyprus are believed to be among the oldest in the world, dated at 9,000 to 10,500 years old, putting them in the Stone Age. They are said to show the sophistication of early settlers, and their heightened appreciation for the environment. In 2004, the remains of an 8-month-old cat were discovered buried with its human owner at a Neolithic archeological site in Cyprus.Wade, Nicholas, \\"Study Traces Cat's Ancestry to Middle East\\", The New York Times, June 29, 2007 The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, predating Egyptian civilization and pushing back the earliest known feline-human association significantly.  Bronze Age  Red Polished Ceramics from Enkomi, 1900-1725 BC. St. Barnabas Archaeological Museum, Salamis, Cyprus In the Bronze Age the first cities, such as Enkomi, were built. Systematic copper mining began, and this resource was widely traded. Mycenaean Greeks were undoubtedly inhabiting Cyprus from the late stage of the Bronze Age, while the island's Greek name is already attested from the 15th century BC in the Linear B script.Through the Mycenaean Greek Linear B , ku- pi-ri-jo, meaning \\"Cypriot\\" and corresponding to the later Greek form , Kyprios. The Cypriot syllabic script was first used in early phases of the late Bronze Age (LCIB) and continued in use for ca. 500 years into the LC IIIB, maybe up to the second half of the eleventh century BC. Most scholars believe it was used for a native Cypriot language (Eteocypriot) that survived until the 4th century BC, but the actual proofs for this are scant, as the tablets still have not been completely deciphered. The LCIIC (1300‚Äì1200 BC) was a time of local prosperity. Cities such as Enkomi were rebuilt on a rectangular grid plan, where the town gates correspond to the grid axes and numerous grand buildings front the street system or newly founded. Great official buildings constructed from ashlar masonry point to increased social hierarchisation and control. Some of these buildings contain facilities for processing and storing olive oil, such as Maroni-Vournes and Building X at Kalavassos-Ayios Dhimitrios. A Sanctuary with a horned altar constructed from ashlar masonry has been found at Myrtou-Pigadhes, other temples have been located at Enkomi, Kition and Kouklia (Palaepaphos). Both the regular layout of the cities and the new masonry techniques find their closest parallels in Syria, especially in Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra). Rectangular corbelled tombs point to close contacts with Syria and Palestine as well. The practice of writing spread and tablets in the Cypriot syllabic script have been found at Ras Shamra which was the Phoenician city of Ugarit. Ugaritic texts from Ras Shamra and Enkomi mention Ya, the Assyrian name of Cyprus, that thus seems to have been in use already in the late Bronze Age. Copper ingots shaped like oxhides have been recovered from shipwrecks such as at Ulu Burun, Iria and Cape Gelidonya which attest to the widespread metal trade. Weights in the shape of animals found in Enkomi and Kalavassos follow the Syro-Palestinian, Mesopotamian, Hittite and Aegean standards and thus attest to the wide-ranging trade as well. Late Bronze Age Cyprus was a part of the Hittite empire but was a client state and as such was not invaded but rather merely part of the empire by association and governed by the ruling kings of Ugarit.Thomas, Carol G. & Conant, C.: The Trojan War, pages 121-122. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005. , 9780313325267. As such Cyprus was essentially \\"left alone with little intervention in Cypriot affairs\\". However, during the reign of Tudhaliya, the island was briefly invaded by the Hittites for either reasons of securing the copper resource or as a way of preventing piracy. Shortly afterwards the island was reconquered by his son around 1200 BC. Although Achaean Greeks were living in Cyprus from the 14th century,Andreas G. Orphanides, \\"Late Bronze Age Socio-Economic and Political Organization, and the Hellenization of Cyprus\\", Athens Journal of History, volume 3, number 1, 2017, pp. 7‚Äì20 most of them inhabited the island after the Trojan war. Achaeans were colonizing Cyprus from 1210 to 1000 BC. Dorian Greeks arrived around 1100 BC and, unlike the pattern on the Greek mainland, the evidence suggests that they settled on Cyprus peacefully. Another wave of Greek settlement is believed to have taken place in the following century (LCIIIB, 1100‚Äì1050), indicated, among other things, by a new type of graves (long dromoi) and Mycenaean influences in pottery decoration. =Pottery= Base ring vessel of Late Bronze Age In the later phase of the late Bronze Age (LCIIIA, 1200‚Äì1100 BC) great amounts of 'Mycenaean' IIIC:1b pottery were produced locally. New architectural features include cyclopean walls, found on the Greek mainland, as well and a certain type of rectangular stepped capitals, endemic on Cyprus. Chamber tombs are given up in favour of shaft graves. Large amounts of IIIC:1b pottery are found in Palestine during this period as well. While this was formerly interpreted as evidence of an invasion ('Sea Peoples'), this is seen more and more as an indigenous development, triggered by increasing trade relations with Cyprus and Crete. Evidence of early trade with Crete is found in archaeological recovery on Cyprus of pottery from Cydonia, a powerful urban center of ancient Crete.C. Michael Hogan, C. Michael Hogan, Cydonia, The Modern Antiquarian, Jan. 23, 2008 =Cypriot city kingdoms= Most authors claim that the Cypriot city kingdoms, first described in written sources in the 8th century BC were already founded in the 11th century BC. Other scholars see a slow process of increasing social complexity between the 12th and the 8th centuries, based on a network of chiefdoms. In the 8th century (geometric period) the number of settlements increases sharply and monumental tombs, like the 'Royal' tombs of Salamis appear for the first time. This could be a better indication for the appearance of the Cypriot kingdoms.  Early Iron Age  The early Iron Age on Cyprus follows the Submycenaean period (1125‚Äì1050 BC) of the Late Bronze Age. It is divided into the Geometric (1050‚Äì700) and Archaic (700‚Äì525) periods. Foundations myths documented by classical authors connect the foundation of numerous Cypriot towns with immigrant Greek heroes in the wake of the Trojan war. For example, Teucer, brother of Aias was supposed to have founded Salamis, and the Arcadian Agapenor of Tegea to have replaced the native ruler Kinyras and to have founded Paphos. Some scholars see this a memory of a Greek colonisation already in the 11th century. In the 11th century tomb 49 from Palaepaphos-Skales three bronze obeloi with inscriptions in Cypriot syllabic script have been found, one of which bears the name of Opheltas. This is first indication of the use of Greek language on the island. Cremation as a burial rite is seen as a Greek introduction as well. The first cremation burial in Bronze vessels has been found at Kourion-Kaloriziki, tomb 40, dated to the first half of the 11th century (LCIIIB). The shaft grave contained two bronze rod tripod stands, the remains of a shield and a golden sceptre as well. Formerly seen as the Royal grave of first Argive founders of Kourion, it is now interpreted as the tomb of a native Cypriote or a Phoenician prince. The cloisonn√© enamelling of the sceptre head with the two falcons surmounting it has no parallels in the Aegean, but shows a strong Egyptian influence. =Phoenicians= Literary evidence suggests an early Phoenician presence at Kition which was under Tyrian rule at the beginning of the 10th century BC. Some Phoenician merchants who were believed to come from Tyre colonized the area and expanded the political influence of Kition. After c. 850 BC the sanctuaries [at the Kathari site] were rebuilt and reused by the Phoenicians.\\"Zeus Keraunios, 500-480 BC, Nicosia museumThe oldest cemetery of Salamis has produced children's burials in Canaanite jars, indication of Phoenician presence already in the LCIIIB 11th century. Similar jar burials have been found in cemeteries in Kourion-Kaloriziki and Palaepaphos-Skales near Kouklia. In Skales, many Levantine imports and Cypriote imitations of Levantine forms have been found and point to a Phoenician expansion even before the end of the 11th century. Ancient Cyprus An ancient Greek theater in Kourion. The first written source shows Cyprus under Assyrian rule. A stela found 1845 in Kition commemorates the victory of king Sargon II (721‚Äì705 BC) in 709 over the seven kings in the land of Ia', in the district of Iadnana or Atnana. The former is supposedly the Assyrian name of the island, while some authors take the latter to mean Greece (the Islands of the Danaoi). There are other inscriptions referring to Ia' in Sargon's palace at Khorsabad. The ten kingdoms listed by an inscription of Esarhaddon in 673/2 BC have been identified as Salamis, Kition, Amathus, Kourion, Paphos and Soli on the coast and Tamassos, Ledra, Idalium and Chytri in the interior. Cyprus gained independence for some time around 669 but was conquered by Egypt under Amasis (570‚Äì526/525). The island was conquered by the Persians around 545 BC. A Persian palace has been excavated in the territory of Marion on the North coast near Soli. The inhabitants took part in the Ionian rising. At the beginning of the 4th century BC, Euagoras I, King of Salamis, took control of the whole island and tried to gain independence from Persia. Another uprising took place in 350 but was crushed by Artaxerxes in 344. During the siege of Tyre, the Cypriot Kings went over to Alexander the Great. In 321 four Cypriot kings sided with Ptolemy I and defended the island against Antigonos. Ptolemy lost Cyprus to Demetrios Poliorketes in 306 and 294 BC, but after that it remained under Ptolemaic rule till 58 BC. It was ruled by a governor from Egypt and sometimes formed a minor Ptolemaic kingdom during the power- struggles of the 2nd and 1st centuries. Strong commercial relationships with Athens and Alexandria, two of the most important commercial centres of antiquity, developed. Full Hellenisation only took place under Ptolemaic rule. Phoenician and native Cypriot traits disappeared, together with the old Cypriot syllabic script. A number of cities were founded during this time, e.g. Arsinoe that was founded between old and new Paphos by Ptolemy II. Cyprus became a Roman province in 58 BC, according to Strabo because the Roman politician, Publius Clodius Pulcher, held a grudge against the king of Cyprus, Ptolemy, and sent Marcus Cato to conquer the island after he had become tribune. Mark Antony gave the island to Cleopatra VII of Egypt and her sister Arsinoe IV, but it became a Roman province again after his defeat at the Battle of Actium (31 BC) in 30 BC. From 22 BC it was a senatorial province. The island suffered great losses during the Jewish uprising of 115/116 AD. After the reforms of Diocletian it was placed under the control of the Consularis Oriens and governed by a proconsul. Several earthquakes led to the destruction of Salamis at the beginning of the 4th century, at the same time drought and famine hit the island. Medieval Cyprus Ayia Paraskevi Byzantine church in Yeroskipou. After the division of the Roman Empire into an eastern half and a western half, Cyprus came under the rule of Constantinople. At that time, its bishop, while still subject to the Church, was made autocephalous by the Council of Ephesus. The Arabs and Muslims invaded Cyprus in force in the 650s, but in 688, the emperor Justinian II and the caliph Abd al-Malik reached an unprecedented agreement. For the next 300 years, Cyprus was ruled jointly by both the Arabs and the Byzantines as a condominium, despite the nearly constant warfare between the two parties on the mainland. The Byzantines recovered control over the island for short periods thereafter, but the status quo was always restored. This period lasted until the year 965, when Niketas Chalkoutzes conquered the island for a resurgent Byzantium. In 1185, the last Byzantine governor of Cyprus, Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus from a minor line of the Imperial house, rose in rebellion and attempted to seize the throne. His attempted coup was unsuccessful, but Comnenus was able to retain control of the island. Byzantine actions against Comnenus failed because he enjoyed the support of William II of Sicily. The Emperor had an agreement with the sultan of Egypt to close Cypriot harbours to the Crusaders. =The Third Crusades= In the 12th century AD the island became a target of the crusaders. Richard the Lionheart landed in Limassol on 1 June 1191 in search of his sister and his bride Berengaria, whose ship had become separated from the fleet in a storm. Richard's army landed when Isaac refused to return the hostages (Richard's sister, his bride, and several shipwrecked soldiers), and forced Isaac to flee from Limassol. He eventually surrendered, conceding control of the island to the King of England. Richard married Berengaria in Limassol on 12 May 1192. She was crowned as Queen of England by John Fitzluke, Bishop of √âvreux. The crusader fleet continued to St. Jean d'Acre (Syria) on 5 June. The army of Richard the Lionheart continued to occupy Cyprus and raised taxes. He sold the island to the Knights Templar. Soon after that, the French (Lusignans) occupied the island, establishing the Kingdom of Cyprus. They declared Latin the official language, later replacing it with French; much later, Greek was recognized as a second official language. In 1196, the Latin Church was established, and the Orthodox Cypriot Church experienced a series of religious persecutions. Maronites settled on Cyprus during the Crusades and still maintain some villages in the North. Kingdom of Cyprus The Nicosia aqueduct Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque in Famagusta, where the Kings of Cyprus were also crowned as Kings of Jerusalem. Cyprus in 1482 Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios Mansion. Amalric I of Cyprus received the royal crown and title from Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. A small minority Roman Catholic population of the island was mainly confined to some coastal cities, such as Famagusta, as well as inland Nicosia, the traditional capital. Roman Catholics kept the reins of power and control, while the Greek inhabitants lived in the countryside; this was much the same as the arrangement in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The independent Eastern Orthodox Church of Cyprus, with its own archbishop and subject to no patriarch, was allowed to remain on the island, but the Latin Church largely displaced it in stature and holding property. After the death of Amalric of Lusignan, the Kingdom continually passed to a series of young boys who grew up as king. The Ibelin family, which had held much power in Jerusalem prior its downfall, acted as regents during these early years. In 1229 one of the Ibelin regents was forced out of power by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, who brought the struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines to the island. Frederick's supporters were defeated in this struggle by 1233, although it lasted longer in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and in the Holy Roman Empire. Frederick's Hohenstaufen descendants continued to rule as kings of Jerusalem until 1268 when Hugh III of Cyprus claimed the title and its territory of Acre for himself upon the death of Conrad III of Jerusalem, thus uniting the two kingdoms. The territory in Palestine was finally lost while Henry II was king in 1291, but the kings of Cyprus continued to claim the title. Like Jerusalem, Cyprus had a Haute Cour (High Court), although it was less powerful than it had been in Jerusalem. The island was richer and more feudal than Jerusalem, so the king had more personal wealth and could afford to ignore the Haute Cour. The most important vassal family was the multi-branch House of Ibelin. However, the king was often in conflict with the Italian merchants, especially because Cyprus had become the centre of European trade with Africa and Asia after the fall of Acre in 1291. The kingdom eventually came to be dominated more and more in the 14th century by the Genoese merchants. Cyprus therefore sided with the Avignon Papacy in the Western Schism, in the hope that the French would be able to drive out the Italians. The Mameluks then made the kingdom a tributary state in 1426; the remaining monarchs gradually lost almost all independence, until 1489 when the last Queen, Catherine Cornaro, was forced to sell the island to Venice. Ottomans started raiding Cyprus immediately afterwards, and captured it in 1571. This is the historical setting to Shakespeare's Othello, the play's title character being the commander of the Venetian garrison defending Cyprus against the Ottomans. Ottoman Cyprus The Russo-Turkish War ended the Ottoman control of Cyprus in 1878. Cyprus then came under the control of the British Empire with its conditions set out in the Cyprus Convention. However, sovereignty of the island continued to be maintained by the Ottoman Empire until Great Britain annexed the island unilaterally in 1914, after it declared war against the Ottomans during the First World War. Following World War I, under the provisions of the Lausanne Treaty, Turkey relinquished all claims and rights on Cyprus. Under British rule the island began to enjoy a period of increased free speech, something which allowed further development of the Greek Cypriots' ideas of enosis (unification with Greece). Modern Cyprus Cypriot demonstrations for Enosis (Union) with Greece. Statue of Liberty symbolising the independence of Cyprus. In 1878, as the result of the Cyprus Convention, the United Kingdom took over the government of Cyprus as a protectorate from the Ottoman Empire. In 1914, at the beginning of World War I, Cyprus was annexed by the United Kingdom. In 1925, following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, Cyprus was made a Crown Colony. Between 1955 and 1959 EOKA was created by Greek Cypriots and led by George Grivas to perform enosis (union of the island with Greece). However the EOKA campaign did not result in union with Greece but rather an independent republic, The Republic of Cyprus, in 1960. The 1960 constitution put in place a form of power-sharing, or consociational government, in which concessions were made to the Turkish Cypriots minority, including as a requirement that the vice- president of Cyprus and at least 30% of members of parliament be Turkish Cypriots. Archbishop Makarios III would be the President and Dr. Fazƒ±l K√º√ß√ºk would become Vice President. One of the articles in the constitution was the creation of separate local municipalities so that Greek and Turkish Cypriots could manage their own municipalities in large towns. Internal conflicts turned into full-fledged armed fighting between the two communities on the island which prompted the United Nations to send peacekeeping forces in 1964; these forces are still in place today. In 1974, Greek nationalists performed a military coup with the support of military junta in Greece. Unable to secure multilateral support against the coup, Turkey invaded the northern portion of the island. Turkish forces remained after a cease-fire, resulting in the partition of the island.Danopoulos, Constantine Panos.

The name was changed to its present form, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, on 15 November 1983. Recognised only by Turkey, Northern Cyprus is considered by the international community to be part of the Republic of Cyprus. In 2002 UN Secretary General Kofi Annan started a new round of negotiations for the unification of the island. In 2004 after long negotiations between both sides a plan for unification of the island emerged. The resulting plan was supported by United Nations, European Union and the United States. The nationalists on both sides campaigned for the rejection of the plan, the result being that Turkish Cypriots accepted the plan while Greek Cypriots rejected it overwhelmingly. After Cyprus became a member of the European Union in 2004, it adopted the euro as its currency on January 1, 2008, replacing the previously used Cypriot pound; Northern Cyprus continued to use the Turkish lira.

It is seen that f maps pairs of lines intersecting at 90¬∞ to pairs of curves still intersecting at 90¬∞. In mathematics, a conformal map is a function that locally preserves angles, but not necessarily lengths. More formally, let U and V be open subsets of \\\\mathbb{R}^n. A function f:U\\\\to V is called conformal (or angle-preserving) at a point u_0\\\\in U if it preserves angles between directed curves through u_0, as well as preserving orientation. Conformal maps preserve both angles and the shapes of infinitesimally small figures, but not necessarily their size or curvature. The conformal property may be described in terms of the Jacobian derivative matrix of a coordinate transformation. The transformation is conformal whenever the Jacobian at each point is a positive scalar times a rotation matrix (orthogonal with determinant one). Some authors define conformality to include orientation-reversing mappings whose Jacobians can be written as any scalar times any orthogonal matrix. For mappings in two dimensions, the (orientation-preserving) conformal mappings are precisely the locally invertible complex analytic functions. In three and higher dimensions, Liouville's theorem sharply limits the conformal mappings to a few types. The notion of conformality generalizes in a natural way to maps between Riemannian or semi-Riemannian manifolds. Conformal maps in two dimensions If U is an open subset of the complex plane \\\\mathbb{C}, then a function f:U\\\\to\\\\mathbb{C} is conformal if and only if it is holomorphic and its derivative is everywhere non-zero on U. If f is antiholomorphic (conjugate to a holomorphic function), it preserves angles but reverses their orientation. In the literature, there is another definition of conformal: a mapping f which is one-to-one and holomorphic on an open set in the plane. The open mapping theorem forces the inverse function (defined on the image of f) to be holomorphic. Thus, under this definition, a map is conformal if and only if it is biholomorphic. The two definitions for conformal maps are not equivalent. Being one-to-one and holomorphic implies having a non-zero derivative. However, the exponential function is a holomorphic function with a nonzero derivative, but is not one- to-one since it is periodic.Richard M. Timoney (2004), Riemann mapping theorem from Trinity College, Dublin The Riemann mapping theorem, one of the profound results of complex analysis, states that any non-empty open simply connected proper subset of \\\\mathbb{C} admits a bijective conformal map to the open unit disk in \\\\mathbb{C}. = Global conformal maps on the Riemann sphere = A map of the Riemann sphere onto itself is conformal if and only if it is a M√∂bius transformation. The complex conjugate of a M√∂bius transformation preserves angles, but reverses the orientation. For example, circle inversions. Conformal maps in three or more dimensions =Riemannian geometry= In Riemannian geometry, two Riemannian metrics g and h on a smooth manifold M are called conformally equivalent if g = u h for some positive function u on M. The function u is called the conformal factor. A diffeomorphism between two Riemannian manifolds is called a conformal map if the pulled back metric is conformally equivalent to the original one. For example, stereographic projection of a sphere onto the plane augmented with a point at infinity is a conformal map. One can also define a conformal structure on a smooth manifold, as a class of conformally equivalent Riemannian metrics. =Euclidean space= A classical theorem of Joseph Liouville shows that there are much fewer conformal maps in higher dimensions than in two dimensions. Any conformal map on a portion of Euclidean space of dimension three or greater can be composed from three types of transformations: a homothety, an isometry, and a special conformal transformation. Applications =Cartography= In cartography, several named map projections, including the Mercator projection and the stereographic projection are conformal. These enjoy the property that the distortion of shapes can be made as small as desired by making the diameter of the mapped region small enough. =Physics and engineering= Conformal mappings are invaluable for solving problems in engineering and physics that can be expressed in terms of functions of a complex variable yet exhibit inconvenient geometries. By choosing an appropriate mapping, the analyst can transform the inconvenient geometry into a much more convenient one. For example, one may wish to calculate the electric field, E(z), arising from a point charge located near the corner of two conducting planes separated by a certain angle (where z is the complex coordinate of a point in 2-space). This problem per se is quite clumsy to solve in closed form. However, by employing a very simple conformal mapping, the inconvenient angle is mapped to one of precisely \\\\pi radians, meaning that the corner of two planes is transformed to a straight line. In this new domain, the problem (that of calculating the electric field impressed by a point charge located near a conducting wall) is quite easy to solve. The solution is obtained in this domain, E(w), and then mapped back to the original domain by noting that w was obtained as a function (viz., the composition of E and w) of z, whence E(w) can be viewed as E(w(z)), which is a function of z, the original coordinate basis. Note that this application is not a contradiction to the fact that conformal mappings preserve angles, they do so only for points in the interior of their domain, and not at the boundary. Another example is the application of conformal mapping technique for solving the boundary value problem of liquid sloshing in tanks. If a function is harmonic (that is, it satisfies Laplace's equation abla^2 f=0) over a plane domain (which is two-dimensional), and is transformed via a conformal map to another plane domain, the transformation is also harmonic. For this reason, any function which is defined by a potential can be transformed by a conformal map and still remain governed by a potential. Examples in physics of equations defined by a potential include the electromagnetic field, the gravitational field, and, in fluid dynamics, potential flow, which is an approximation to fluid flow assuming constant density, zero viscosity, and irrotational flow. One example of a fluid dynamic application of a conformal map is the Joukowsky transform. For discrete systems, Keyvan presented a way to convert discrete systems root locus into continuous root locus through a well-know conformal mapping in geometry (aka inversion mapping). =Maxwell's equations= A large group of conformal maps for relating solutions of Maxwell's equations was identified by Ebenezer Cunningham (1908) and Harry Bateman (1910). Their training at Cambridge University had given them facility with the method of image charges and associated methods of images for spheres and inversion. As recounted by Andrew Warwick (2003) Masters of Theory: : Each four-dimensional solution could be inverted in a four-dimensional hyper-sphere of pseudo-radius K in order to produce a new solution. Warwick highlights this \\"new theorem of relativity\\" as a Cambridge response to Einstein, and as founded on exercises using the method of inversion, such as found in James Hopwood Jeans textbook Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism. =General relativity= In general relativity, conformal maps are the simplest and thus most common type of causal transformations. Physically, these describe different universes in which all the same events and interactions are still (causally) possible, but a new additional force is necessary to effect this (that is, replication of all the same trajectories would necessitate departures from geodesic motion because the metric tensor is different). It is often used to try to make models amenable to extension beyond curvature singularities, for example to permit description of the universe even before the Big Bang. Pseudo- Riemannian geometry In differential geometry a mapping is conformal when angles are preserved. When the angle is related to the metric, it is sufficient for the mapping to result in a metric that is proportional to the original, as expressed above for Riemannian geometry or in the case of a conformal manifold with the type of metric tensor used in general relativity. An elementary consideration of surface mapping and linear algebra reveals potentially three types of angles: circular angle, hyperbolic angle, and slope: Suppose f: U \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} is a mapping of surfaces parameterized by (x,y) and (u,v). The Jacobian matrix of f is formed by the four partial derivatives of u and v with respect to x and y. If the Jacobian g has a non-zero determinant, then f is conformal with respect to one of the three angle types, depending on the real matrix expressed by the Jacobian g. Indeed, any such g lies in a particular planar commutative subring, and g has a polar decomposition determined by parameters of radial and angular nature. The radial parameter corresponds to a similarity mapping and can be taken as 1 for purposes of conformal examination. The angular parameter of g is one of the three types, slope, hyperbolic, or circular: * When the subring is isomorphic to the dual number plane, then g acts as a shear mapping and preserves the dual angle. * When the subring is isomorphic to the split- complex number plane, then g acts as a squeeze mapping and preserves the hyperbolic angle. * When the subring is isomorphic to the ordinary complex number plane, then g acts as a rotation and preserves the circular angle. While describing analytic functions of a bireal variable, U. Bencivenga and G. Fox have written about conformal maps that preserve the hyperbolic angle. In general, a linear fractional transformation on any one of the types of complex plane listed provides a conformal map.

He was the chief executive officer of a family of lines headed by the Great Northern Railway, which served a substantial area of the Upper Midwest, the northern Great Plains, and Pacific Northwest. Because of the size of this region and the economic dominance exerted by the Hill lines, Hill became known during his lifetime as \\"The Empire Builder\\". Biography =Childhood and youth= Hill was born in Eramosa Township, Wellington County, Upper Canada (now Ontario). A childhood accident with a bow and arrow blinded him in the right eye. He had nine years of formal schooling. He attended the Rockwood Academy for a short while, where the head gave him free tuition.James J. Hill and the Building of His Railroad Empire Railserve He was forced to leave school in 1852 due to the death of his father. By the time he had finished, he was adept at algebra, geometry, land surveying, and English. His particular talents for English and mathematics would be critical later in his life. Hill circa 1856 After working as a clerk in Kentucky (during which he learned bookkeeping), Hill decided to permanently move to the United States and settled in St. Paul, Minnesota, at the age of 18. His first job in St. Paul was with a steamboat company, where he worked as a bookkeeper. By 1860, he was working for wholesale grocers, for whom he handled freight transfers, especially dealing with railroads and steamboats. Through this work, he learned all aspects of the freight and transportation business. During this period, Hill began to work for himself for the first time. During the winter months when the Mississippi River was frozen and steamboats could not run, Hill started bidding on other contracts and won several. =Young businessman= Because of his previous experiences in shipping and fuel supply, Hill was able to enter both the coal and steamboat businesses. In 1870, he and his partners started the Red River Transportation Company, which offered steam boat transportation between St. Paul and Winnipeg. By 1879 he had a local monopoly by merging with Norman Kittson. In 1867, Hill entered the coal business, and by 1879 it had expanded five times over, giving Hill a local monopoly in the anthracite coal business. During this same period, Hill also entered into banking and quickly managed to become member of several major banks' boards of directors. He also bought out bankrupt businesses, built them up again, and then resold them‚Äîoften gaining a substantial profit. Hill noted that the secret to his success was \\"work, hard work, intelligent work, and then more work.\\" =Entry into Gilded Era railroading= During the Panic of 1873, a number of railroads, including the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (StP&P;), had gone bankrupt. The StP&P; in particular was caught in an almost hopeless legal muddle. For James Hill it was a golden opportunity. For three years, Hill researched the StP&P; and finally concluded that it would be possible to make a good deal of money off the StP&P;, provided that the initial capital could be found. Hill teamed up with Norman Kittson (the man he had merged steamboat businesses with), Donald Smith, George Stephen and John Stewart Kennedy. Together they not only bought the railroad, they also vastly expanded it by bargaining for trackage rights with the Northern Pacific Railway. In May 1879, the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railway Co. (StPM&M;) formed‚Äîwith James J. Hill as general manager. His first goal was to expand and upgrade even more. Hill was a hands-on, detail-obsessed manager. A Canadian himself of Scotch-Irish Protestant ancestry, he brought in many men with the same background into high management.Claire Strom, \\"Among Friends: The Power of Ethnicity in the Great Northern Railway Corporation,\\" Journal of the West (2009) 48#4 pp 11-17. He wanted people to settle along his rail lines, so he sold homesteads to immigrants while transporting them to their new homes using his rail lines. When he was looking for the best path for one of his tracks to take, he went on horseback and scouted it personally. Under his management, StPM&M; prospered. In 1880, its net worth was $728,000 (equal to $ today); in 1885 it was $25,000,000, equal to $ today. One of his challenges at this point was the avoidance of federal action against railroads. If the federal government believed that the railroads were making too much profit, they might see this as an opportunity to force lowering of the railway tariff rates. Hill avoided this by investing a large portion of the railroad's profit back into the railroad itself‚Äîand charged those investments to operating expense. It was at this point that Hill went from general manager to the official president of StPM&M;, and thereafter decided to expand the rail lines. Hill circa 1890 =\\"Empire Builder\\"= Between 1883 and 1889, Hill built his railroads across Minnesota, into Wisconsin, and across North Dakota to Montana. When there was not enough industry in the areas Hill was building, Hill brought the industry in, often by buying out a company and placing plants along his railroad lines. By 1889, Hill decided that his future lay in expanding into a transcontinental railroad. \\"What we want,\\" Hill is quoted as saying, \\"is the best possible line, shortest distance, lowest grades, and least curvature we can build. We do not care enough for Rocky Mountains scenery to spend a large sum of money developing it.\\" Hill got what he wanted, and in January 1893 his Great Northern Railway, running from St. Paul, Minnesota to Seattle, Washington ‚Äî a distance of more than ‚Äî was completed. The Great Northern was the first transcontinental built without public money and just a few land grants, and was one of the few transcontinental railroads not to go bankrupt. Hill chose to build his railroad north of the competing Northern Pacific line, which had reached the Pacific Northwest over much more difficult terrain with more bridges, steeper grades, and tunnelling. Hill did much of the route planning himself, travelling over proposed routes on horseback. The key to the Great Northern line was Hill's use of the previously unmapped Marias Pass. The pass had initially been described by Lewis and Clark in 1805, but no one since had been able to find it so Hill hired Santiago Jameson to search it out. Jameson discovered the pass 1889 and it shortened the Great Northern's route by almost one hundred miles. The pass had been discovered by John Frank Stevens, principal engineer of the Great Northern Railway, in December 1889, and offered an easier route across the Rockies than that taken by the Northern Pacific. The Great Northern reached Seattle on 7 January 1893. In 1898 Hill purchased control of large parts of the Mesabi Range iron mining district in Minnesota, along with its rail lines. The Great Northern began large-scale shipment of ore to the steel mills of the Midwest.Don L. Hofsommer, \\"Ore Docks and Trains: The Great Northern Railway and the Mesabi Range,\\" Railroad History (1996) Issue 174, pp 5-25 Settlements The Great Northern energetically promoted settlement along its lines in North Dakota and Montana, especially by Germans and Scandinavians from Europe. The Great Northern bought its lands from the federal government‚Äîit received no land grants‚Äîand resold them to farmers at cheap prices. It operated agencies in Germany and Scandinavia that promoted its lands, and brought families over at low cost. Hill also invested in founding schools and churches for these communities and promoted a variety of progressive techniques to ensure they prospered. This \\"Dakota Boom\\" peaked in 1882 as 42,000 immigrants, largely from northern Europe, poured into the Red River Valley running through the region. The rapidly increasing settlement in North Dakota's Red River Valley along the Minnesota border between 1871 and 1890 was a major example of large-scale \\"bonanza\\" farming.[8][9][10] =Hill Lines in the 1890s= Six months after the railroad reached Seattle came the deep nationwide depression called the Panic of 1893. Hill's leadership became a case study in the successful management of a capital-intensive business during the economic downturn. In order to ensure that he did not lose his patronage during the crisis, Hill lowered rail tariff shipping rates for farmers and gave credit to many of the businesses he owned so they could continue paying their workers and starting a \\"10 dollar trip\\" (equal to $ today) for immigrants. He also took strong measures to economize‚Äîin just one year, Hill cut the railway's expense of carrying a ton of freight by 13%. Because of these measures, Hill not only stayed in business, but also increased the net worth of his railroad by nearly $10,000,000 (equal to $ today). Meanwhile, nearly every other transcontinental railroad went bankrupt. His ability to ride out the depression garnered him fame and admiration. Hill saved money by repeatedly cutting wages, made possible by a time of deflation when prices were falling generally. In 1893, Hill began the process of looking for a source of labor other than Chinese workers. For a brief period of time, he hired Italian and Greek laborers, but company officials were not satisfied with their performance. Hill sent emissaries to the Pacific who found that Japan had the most potential in the market of \\"Oriental Trade,\\" and he decided to capitalize on this opportunity. In this time he also began to focus his energies on securing trade with Asian countries. He offered Japanese Industrialists Southern cotton and would even ship it for free if they would compare it with the short staple cotton they were using with the promise of a refund if they were dissatisfied, which they were not. With these friendly relations established, Hill managed to secure the industrializing Japanese order for 15,000 tons of rails against competition from England and Belgium. From 1886 to 1905, American exports to Japan leapt from $7.7 million a year (equal to $ today) to $51.7 million, equal to $ today. Leonard says that after 1900 Hill exhibited poor business judgment regarding one Canadian subsidiary, the Vancouver, Westminster and Yukon Railway Company (VW&Y;). He ousted its president John Hendry, thereby worsening the problems, prolonging the delays, and adding to the costs of taking over the VW&Y.; Hill's top aides were careless about details, bookkeeping, correspondence, and reports.Frank Leonard, \\"Railroading a Renegade: Great Northern Ousts John Hendry in Vancouver,\\" BC Studies (2007), Issue 155, pp 69-92. =The Northern Pacific and the \\"short squeeze\\" of 1901= With 1901 and the start of the new century, James Hill now had control of both the Great Northern Railway, and the Northern Pacific (which he had obtained with the help of his friend J. P. Morgan, when that railroad went bankrupt in the depression of the mid-1890s). Hill also wanted control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroad because of its Midwestern lines and access to Chicago. The Union Pacific Railroad was the biggest competitor of Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railroads. Although Great Northern and Northern Pacific were backed by J. P. Morgan and James J. Hill, the Union Pacific was backed not only by its president, Edward H. Harriman, but by the extremely powerful William Rockefeller and Jacob Schiff. Quietly, Harriman began buying stock in Northern Pacific with the intention of gaining control of Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy. He was within 40,000 shares of control when Hill learned of Harriman's activities and quickly contacted J. P. Morgan, who ordered his men to buy everything they could get their hands on. The result was chaos on Wall Street. Northern Pacific stock was forced up to $1,000 per share. Many speculators, who had sold Northern Pacific \\"short\\" in the anticipation of a drop in the railroad's price, faced ruin. The threat of a real economic panic loomed. Neither side could win a distinct advantage, and the parties soon realized that a truce would have to be called. The winners of that truce were Hill and Morgan, who immediately formed the Northern Securities Company with the aim of tying together their three major rail lines. As the Hill-Morgan alliance formed the Northern Securities Company, Theodore Roosevelt became president and turned his energies against the great trusts that were monopolizing trade. =The Hill Lines survive the trust-busting era= Roosevelt sent his Justice Department to sue the Northern Securities Company in 1902. The Supreme Court in 1904 ordered it to be dissolved as a monopoly. (Ironically, the Burlington Route, Northern Pacific, and Great Northern would later merge in 1970 to form the Burlington Northern Railroad.) This unfortunately ended Hill's ability to maintain competitive rates in Asian countries and in the subsequent two years American trade with Japan and China dropped 40% (or $41 million). Hill moved on without the benefit of a central company, and acquired the Colorado and Southern Railway lines into Texas. He also built the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway. By the time of his death in 1916, James J. Hill was worth more than $53 million (equal to more than $ today). When his estate was divided his widow received over 16 million, and each of his children received almost 4 million; only 1.5 million was paid in income and inheritance taxes. The Great Northern Railway and the Northern Pacific tried to merge four times, in 1896, 1901, 1927, and 1955. This last attempt lasted from 1955 until final Supreme Court approval and merger in March, 1970, which created the Burlington Northern Railroad. In 1995, Burlington Northern merged with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to become the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway. =Family life= In 1867, James J. Hill married Mary Theresa Mehegan, born in 1846 in New York City. They had ten children: # Mary Francis Hill Hill (1869‚Äì1947), who married Samuel Hill of Washington D.C. and Seattle. Samuel Hill was an executive at the Great Northern Railway when he married Mary Hill. # James Norman Hill (1870‚Äì1932) of New York City. # Louis Warren Hill (1872‚Äì1948) of St. Paul, Minnesota, who was named president of the GN in 1907 and board chairman in 1912. # Clara Anne Hill Lindley (1873‚Äì1947), who married E. C Lindley of St. Paul, Minnesota, who was Vice President, Counsel General, and a member of the Board of Directors of the Great Northern Railway. # Katherine Theresa Hill (1875‚Äì1876) (died in infancy) # Charlotte Elizabeth Hill Slade (1877‚Äì1923), who married George T. Slade of New York City and St. Paul, Minnesota. George T. Slade was an executive at The Great Northern Railway and Yale classmate of Louis W. Hill. # Ruth Hill Beard (1879‚Äì1959), who married Anson McCook Beard of New York City. # Rachel Hill Boeckmann (1881‚Äì1967), who married Egil Boeckmann of St. Paul, Minnesota. # Gertrude Hill Gavin (1883‚Äì1961), who married Michael Gavin of New York City. # Walter Jerome Hill (1885‚Äì1944) of St. Paul, Minnesota. Walthill, Nebraska, was named for Walter. Death By early 1916 Hill began pouring more attention into philanthropy, donating thousands of dollars to various institutions as he privately struggled with a variety of increasingly painful ailments. His condition deteriorated quickly in mid-May, but even with the help of many respected doctors he was beyond saving. After falling into a coma, he died in his home in St. Paul, Minnesota, on May 29, 1916.[14] Mary Hill died in 1922 and was buried next to her husband by the shore of Pleasant Lake on their North Oaks farm. Because of vandals and curious admirers, both graves were later moved to Resurrection Cemetery in St. Paul for safer keeping. Hill's legacy Politically, Hill was a Bourbon Democrat. The Democratic Party's continued enchantment with the populist William Jennings Bryan led Hill to support Republican presidential candidates William McKinley (1896 and 1900), Theodore Roosevelt (1904), and William Howard Taft (1908 and 1912). Hill was a supporter of free trade and was one of the few supporters of free trade with Canada. In St. Paul, the city's main library building and the adjoining Hill Business Library were funded by him. In addition, he donated to numerous schools, including the Saint Paul Seminary. Hill was a member of the Jekyll Island Club (aka The Millionaires Club) on Jekyll Island, Georgia, along with J. P. Morgan and William Rockefeller. Hill's former home at 240 Summit Avenue in St. Paul, Minnesota Portrait of Hill, located in the library of his former home Hill and Carl Raymond Gray c. 1913 In 1891, after three years of building, construction was completed on Hill's new family home at 240 Summit Avenue in St. Paul. Over 400 workers labored on the project. Built at a cost of $930,000 and with , the James J. Hill House was among the city's largest. As with his business dealings, Hill supervised the construction and design himself, hiring and firing several architects in the process. The house has many early electrical and mechanical systems that predate widespread adoption in modern domestic structures. Upon completion of the Summit Avenue residence, Hill had the family's old house, which he had constructed in 1878, razed. After the death of Hill's wife in 1921, the house was donated to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis. It was obtained by the Minnesota Historical Society in 1978 and today is operated as a museum and gallery. Though a Protestant, Hill maintained a strong philanthropic relationship with the Catholic Church in St. Paul and throughout the northwest. Hill's historic home is located next to the Cathedral, largely due to the special relationship Hill's wife, a practicing Catholic, had with the Diocese. The Hills maintained close ties with Archbishop John Ireland, and Hill was a major contributor to the Saint Paul Seminary, Macalester College, Hamline University, the University of St. Thomas, Carleton College, and other educational, religious and charitable organizations. He was the first major donor to the Marquette University School of Medicine. In order to generate business for his railroad, Hill encouraged European immigrants to settle along his line, often paying for Russian and Scandinavian settlers to travel from Europe. To promote settlement and revenue for his rail business, Hill experimented with agriculture and worked to hybridize Russian wheat for Dakota soil and weather conditions. He also ran model experimental farms in Minnesota, such as North Oaks, to develop superior livestock and crop yields for the settlers locating near his railroads. An enthusiastic conservationist, Hill was invited by President Theodore Roosevelt to a governors' conference on conservation of natural resources, and later appointed to a lands commission. Drawing on his experience in the development of Minnesota's Iron Range, Hill was, during 1911‚Äì1912, in close contact with Gaspard Farrer of Baring Brothers & Company of London regarding the formation of the Brazilian Iron Ore Company to tap that nation's rich mineral deposits. Near the end of his life, Hill played what a recent biographer, Albro Martin, called his \\"last and greatest role.\\" After the first punishing year of World War I, the Allied Powers desperately needed financial support to continue the war effort. To that end, Hill was a major figure in the effort launched by J.P. Morgan to float the Anglo-French Bond drive of 1915, which allowed the Allies to purchase much- needed foodstuffs and other supplies. In September 1915, the first public loan, the $500,000,000 Anglo-French loan, was floated after negotiations with the Anglo-French Financial Commission. Concomitantly, the resulting trade in munitions with England and France carried the United States from a depression in 1914 to boom years in 1915 and 1916.Harry Elmer Barnes: The World War of 1914‚Äì1918 at tmh.floonet.net Hillsboro, North Dakota; Hill County, Montana; and Hillyard, Washington (now a neighborhood of Spokane), are named for him. Jim Hill Mountain near Stevens Pass in the Cascade Range is named after him, also In 1929, the Great Northern Railway inaugurated a long-distance passenger train extending from Chicago to Seattle, and named it the Empire Builder in his honor. The train served as Great Northern's flagship train, and is still operated today by Amtrak. using former Great Northern tracks west of St. Paul. The James J. Hill House in St. Paul, is a National Historic Landmark. In 1887, the Great Northern's first company headquarters building was constructed in St. Paul. It was designed by James Brodie, who also built the Hill house on Summit Avenue. The 1887 building was converted between 2000 and 2004 to a 53 unit condo in the Historic Lowertown District of St. Paul.Great Northern Lofts - Condo and Loft Directory at http://www.yourstpaulhome.com Hill had seen the devastation done downtown by the Great Chicago Fire. As a result, one feature Hill integrated into the construction of the 1887 company headquarters (the Great Northern General Office Building) was barrel-vaulted ceilings constructed of brick and railroad steel rails that held up a layer of sand several inches deep. The theory was that if a fire broke out and the ceiling caved in, the sand would drop and retard or suppress the fire. Hill was intimately involved in the planning and construction (1914‚Äì1916) of a new company headquarters in St. Paul (to be known as the Great Northern Office Building), which was to house the corporate staffs of the Great Northern, the Northern Pacific and Hill's banking enterprises. The 14-story building cost $14 million to construct. Hill's heirs established the James J. Hill Reference Library in St. Paul, which is considered by the Small Business Administration the premier source for publicly accessible practical business information in the United States, and many SBA programs rely on the Hill Library's HillSearch service to provide business information resources to small businesses nationwide. The Hill Library has developed numerous online programs and now serves millions of small business owners worldwide. In The Great Gatsby, Hill is the man whom Gatsby's father says Gatsby would have equalled if he had lived long enough. Hill and his railway are mentioned in the Harry McClintock song \\"Hallelujah, I'm a Bum.\\" In 1959, Hill High in St. Paul, Minnesota, was established as a school from the funds set aside from Hill's wife for education. The school, which was all-male, consolidated in 1971 with the all- female Archbishop Murray School to form Hill-Murray School in Maplewood, Minnesota. Hill Capital is a venture capital fund established in 2016 \\"aligned with James J. Hill's belief in the cooperation of the production, distribution and exchange of wealth as outlined in his writings\\".http://www.hillcapitalcorp.com/ The Hill library owns 75 shares. As of September 2016, the fund is not yet closed. In 1958, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. A bust of Hill is located on the University of Washington campus in Seattle, Washington. It is currently situated in front of More Hall, which is adjacent to the former on campus nuclear reactor building. See also * Charles T.

Ford is now remembered for his novels The Good Soldier (1915), the Parade's End tetralogy (1924‚Äì28) and The Fifth Queen trilogy (1906‚Äì08). The Good Soldier is frequently included among the great literature of the 20th century, including the Modern Library 100 Best Novels, The Observer‚Ä≤s \\"100 Greatest Novels of All Time\\", and The Guardian‚Ä≤s \\"1000 novels everyone must read\\". Early life Ford was born in Wimbledon in London, to Catherine Madox Brown and Francis Hueffer, the eldest of three; his brother was Oliver Madox Hueffer and his sister was Juliet Catherine Emma Hueffer, the wife of David Soskice and mother of Frank Soskice. Ford's father, who became music critic for The Times, was German and his mother English. His paternal grandfather Johann Hermann H√ºffer was first to publish Westphalian poet and author Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff. He was named after his maternal grandfather, the Pre-Raphaelite painter Ford Madox Brown, whose biography he would eventually write. His mother's older half-sister was Lucy Madox Brown, the wife of William Michael Rossetti and mother of Olivia Rossetti Agresti. In 1889, after the death of his father, Ford and Oliver went to live with their grandfather in London. Ford graduated from the University College School in London, but never attended university. Personal life In 1894, Ford eloped with his school girlfriend Elsie Martindale. The couple were married in Gloucester and moved to Bonnington. In 1901, they moved to Winchelsea. They had two daughters, Christina (born 1897) and Katharine (born 1900). Ford's neighbours in Winchelsea included the authors Henry James and H.G. Wells. In 1904, Ford suffered an agoraphobic breakdown due to financial and marital problems. He went to Germany to spend time with family there and undergo cure treatments. In 1909, Ford left his wife and set up home with English writer Isobel Violet Hunt, with whom he published the literary magazine The English Review. Ford's wife refused to divorce him and he attempted to become a German citizen in order to obtain a divorce in Germany. This was unsuccessful. A reference in an illustrated paper to Violet Hunt as \\"Mrs Ford Madox Hueffer\\" gave rise to a successful libel action being brought by Mrs Ford in 1913. Ford's relationship with Hunt did not survive the First World War.South Lodge by Douglas Goldring, Constable and Co, 1943) Ford used the name of Ford Madox Hueffer, but he changed it to Ford Madox Ford after World War I in 1919 because \\"Hueffer\\" sounded too Germanic. Between 1918 and 1927, he lived with Stella Bowen, an Australian artist 20 years his junior. In 1920, Ford and Bowen had a daughter, Julia Madox Ford. In the summer of 1927, The New York Times reported that Ford had converted a mill building in Avignon, France into a home and workshop that he called \\"Le Vieux Moulin\\". The article implied that Ford was reunited with his wife at this point. In the early 1930s Ford established a relationship with Janice Biala, a Polish-born artist from New York, who illustrated several of Ford's later books.South Lodge by Douglas Goldring, Constable & Co, 1943) This relationship lasted until the late 1930s. Ford spent the last years of his life teaching at Olivet College in Olivet, Michigan. He was taken ill in Honfleur, France in June 1939 and died shortly afterwards in Deauville at the age of 65. Literary life Blue plaque, 80 Campden Hill Road, Kensington, London One of Ford's most famous works is the novel The Good Soldier (1915). Set just before World War I, The Good Soldier chronicles the tragic expatriate lives of two \\"perfect couples\\", one British and one American, using intricate flashbacks. In the \\"Dedicatory Letter to Stella Ford‚Äù that prefaces the novel, Ford reports that a friend pronounced The Good Soldier ‚Äúthe finest French novel in the English language!‚Äù Ford pronounced himself a \\"Tory mad about historic continuity\\" and believed the novelist's function was to serve as the historian of his own time. However, he was dismissive of the Conservative Party, referring to it as \\"the Stupid Party.\\" Ford was involved in British war propaganda after the beginning of World War I. He worked for the War Propaganda Bureau, managed by C. F. G. Masterman, along with Arnold Bennett, G. K. Chesterton, John Galsworthy, Hilaire Belloc and Gilbert Murray. Ford wrote two propaganda books for Masterman; When Blood is Their Argument: An Analysis of Prussian Culture (1915), with the help of Richard Aldington, and Between St Dennis and St George: A Sketch of Three Civilizations (1915). After writing the two propaganda books, Ford enlisted at 41 years of age into the Welch Regiment of the British Army on 30 July 1915. He was sent to France. Ford's combat experiences and his previous propaganda activities inspired his tetralogy Parade's End (1924‚Äì1928), set in England and on the Western Front before, during and after World War I. Cover of book digitized by Google from the library of Harvard University and uploaded to the Internet Archive by user tpb Ford wrote dozens of novels as well as essays, poetry, memoirs and literary criticism. He collaborated with Joseph Conrad on three novels, The Inheritors (1901), Romance (1903) and The Nature of a Crime (1924, although written much earlier). During the three to five years after this direct collaboration, Ford's best known achievement was The Fifth Queen trilogy (1906‚Äì1908), historical novels based on the life of Catherine Howard, which Conrad termed, at the time, \\"the swan song of historical romance.\\" Ford's poem Antwerp (1915) was praised by T.S. Eliot as \\"the only good poem I have met with on the subject of the war\\". Ford's novel Ladies Whose Bright Eyes (1911, extensively revised in 1935) is, in a sense, the reverse of Twain's novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, Ford took the side of the left Republican faction, declaring: \\"I am unhesitatingly for the existing Spanish Government and against Franco‚Äôs attempt‚Äîon every ground of feeling and reason...Mr Franco wishes to establish a government resting on the arms of Moors, Germans, Italians. Its success must be contrary to world conscience.\\" His opinion of Mussolini and Hitler was likewise negative, and he offered to sign a manifesto against Nazism. Promotion of literature In 1908, Ford founded The English Review. Ford published works by Thomas Hardy, H. G. Wells, Joseph Conrad, Henry James, May Sinclair, John Galsworthy and William Butler Yeats; and debuted works of Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis, D. H. Lawrence and Norman Douglas. Ezra Pound and other Modernist poets in London in the teens particularly valued Ford's poetry as exemplifying treatment of modern subjects in contemporary diction. In 1924, he founded The Transatlantic Review, a journal with great influence on modern literature. Staying with the artistic community in the Latin Quarter of Paris, Ford befriended James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound and Jean Rhys, all of whom he would publish (Ford was the model for the character Braddocks in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises). Basil Bunting worked as Ford's assistant on the magazine. As a critic, Ford is known for remarking \\"Open the book to page ninety-nine and read, and the quality of the whole will be revealed to you.\\" George Seldes, in his book Witness to a Century, describes Ford (\\"probably in 1932\\") recalling his writing collaboration with Joseph Conrad, and the lack of acknowledgment by publishers of his status as co- author. Seldes recounts Ford's disappointment with Hemingway: \\"'and he disowns me now that he has become better known than I am.' Tears now came to Ford's eyes.\\" Ford says, \\"I helped Joseph Conrad, I helped Hemingway. I helped a dozen, a score of writers, and many of them have beaten me. I'm now an old man and I'll die without making a name like Hemingway.\\" Seldes observes, \\"At this climax Ford began to sob. Then he began to cry.\\" Hemingway devoted a chapter of his Parisian memoir A Moveable Feast to an encounter with Ford at a caf√© in Paris during the early 1920s. He describes Ford \\"as upright as an ambulatory, well clothed, up-ended hogshead.\\" During a later sojourn in the United States, Ford was involved with Allen Tate, Caroline Gordon, Katherine Anne Porter and Robert Lowell (who was then a student). Ford was always a champion of new literature and literary experimentation. In 1929, he published The English Novel: From the Earliest Days to the Death of Joseph Conrad, a brisk and accessible overview of the history of English novels. He had an affair with Jean Rhys, which ended acrimoniously,which Rhys fictionalised in her novel Quartet. Reception Ford is best remembered for his novels The Good Soldier (1915), the Parade's End tetralogy (1924‚Äì1928) and The Fifth Queen trilogy (1906‚Äì1908). The Good Soldier is frequently included among the great literature of the 20th century, including the Modern Library 100 Best Novels, The Observer‚Ä≤s \\"100 Greatest Novels of All Time\\", and The Guardian‚Ä≤s \\"1000 novels everyone must read\\". Anthony Burgess described Ford as the \\"greatest British novelist\\" of the 20th century.

Texas Longhorns are known for their diverse coloring, and can be any color or mix of colors, but coloration mixes of dark red and white are the most dominant. Registries for the breed include: the Texas Longhorn Breeders Association of America, founded in 1964 by the Kerr County rancher Charles Schreiner, III; the International Texas Longhorn Association; and the Cattlemen's Texas Longhorn Registry. The online National Texas Longhorn Museum displays the diversity of horns found in the breed, stories about notable individual cattle of the breed, and a gallery of furniture made from cattle horns. The longest recorded total-horn-length marks is 129.5 inches (3.29 m), the spread of longhorn M Arrow Cha-Ching. This longhorn is owned by Richard Flip, who lives near Fayetteville, Texas. The second-longest on record is 3S Danica of Tallgrass Cattle Company, which measured 100 inches (2.54 m) tip to tip on September 13, 2018. Due to their innate gentle disposition and intelligence, Texas Longhorns are increasingly being trained for steer riding, including being used in parades. History of the cattle A Texas Longhorn in Alvin, Texas. A Texas Longhorn in Fort Worth, Texas. Genetic analyses show that the Texas Longhorn originated from an Iberian taurine lineage that descended from the domestication of the wild aurochs in the Middle East, with some admixture of the European aurochs, and was later (while in America) crossed with \\"indicine\\" cattle that descended from the domestication of aurochs in India, 85% and 15%, respectively, by proportion. The Texas Longhorns are direct descendants of the first cattle introduced to the New World. In 1493, Christopher Columbus brought the original ancestral cattle to the Caribbean island then-referred to as La Isla Espa√±ola (now known as Hispaniola), to serve as a food supply for the colonists. Between 1493 and 1512, Spanish colonists brought additional cattle in subsequent expeditions. The cattle consisted of three different breeds: Barrenda, Retinto, and Grande Pieto. Over the next two centuries, the Spaniards used the cattle in Mexico, and gradually moved them north to accompany their expanding settlements. The Spaniards reached the area that became known as \\"Texas\\" near the end of the 17th century. Eventually, some cattle escaped or were turned loose on the open range, where they remained mostly feral for the next two centuries. Over several generations, descendants of these cattle developed to have high feed- and drought-stress tolerances, and other \\"hardy\\" characteristics that have given Longhorns their reputation as livestock. Early Anglo-American settlers in East Texas, then a part of Mexico, obtained feral Mexican cattle from the borderland between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande. They bred them to their own eastern cattle. The result was a tough, rangy animal that was characterized by its lengthy legs, and exceptionally long horns that extended up to 7 feet. Selective breeding produced color variations within the breed. The varieties of color ranged from bluish-grey, various yellowish hues, to browns, black, ruddy, and white‚Äîboth cleanly bright or dirty-speckled. Portugueses cattle breeds, such as Alentejana and Mertolenga, are the closest existing relatives of Texas Longhorns. Decline and revival Riding a Texas Longhorn on Padre Island, Texas As Texas became more densely settled through increased migration after it was annexed by the US, the frontier was developed for crop farms and ranch lands. The leaner beef of the Texas Longhorn was not as attractive in an era where tallow was highly prized. The breed's ability to survive on the poor vegetation of the open range was not as important as the range was enclosed. Other breeds demonstrated traits more highly valued by the modern rancher, such as the ability to gain weight quickly for marketing as beef. The Texas Longhorn stock slowly dwindled, but in 1927, the breed was saved from near extinction by enthusiasts from the United States Forest Service. They collected a small herd of stock to breed on the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in Lawton, Oklahoma. The breed also received significant attention after a Texas Longhorn named \\"Bevo\\" was adopted as the mascot of The University of Texas at Austin in 1917. The animal's image became commonly associated with the school's sports teams, known as the Texas Longhorns. A few years later, J. Frank Dobie and others gathered small herds to keep in Texas state parks. Oilman Sid W. Richardson helped finance the project. The Longhorns were cared for largely as curiosities, but the stock's longevity, resistance to disease, and ability to thrive on marginal pastures resulted in a revival of the breed as beef stock and for their link to Texas history. In 1957, Charles Schreiner III began creating a Longhorn herd on his ranch, the Y O, in Mountain Home, Texas as a tribute to the ranching legacy of his grandfather, Captain Charles Armand Schreiner, and the Longhorns he ran on his ranches. Schreiner purchased five heifers and one bull calf for $75 each from the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge near Lawton. In 1964, Charlie founded the Texas Longhorn Breeders Association of America. The YO herd was the first cattle registered with the association. To draw attention to the Longhorn and its new association, in 1966, Charlie organized a cattle drive of Longhorn steers from San Antonio, Texas to Dodge City, Kansas. The drive was promoted as a centennial commemoration of the earlier Chisholm Trail drives. Always a stickler for authenticity, Charlie arranged for local members of the Quanah sherriff‚Äôs posse to stage a simulated ‚ÄúIndian attack‚Äù as the steers crossed the Red River at Doan's Crossing. The attack was so authentic that the steers stampeded with cowboys in close pursuit. Four hours were needed to reassemble the herd. In 1976, Texas Tech University in Lubbock persuaded Charlie to stage a cattle trail drive to celebrate its new National Ranching Heritage Center. In 1995, the Texas Legislature designated the Texas Longhorn as the state mammal (large). In the 21st century, Texas Longhorns from elite bloodlines can sell for $40,000 or more at auction. The record of $380,000 on March 18, 2017, was for a cow, 3S Danica, and heifer calf at side, during the Legacy XIII sale in Fort Worth, Texas. Commercial ranchers cross-breed Texas Longhorns with other breeds for increasing hybrid vigor and easy calving characteristics. Smaller birth weights reduce dystocia for first-calf heifers.

A sequence of functions (f_n) converges uniformly to a limiting function f on a set E if, given any arbitrarily small positive number \\\\epsilon, a number N can be found such that each of the functions f_N, f_{N+1},f_{N+2},\\\\ldots differ from f by no more than \\\\epsilon at every point x in E. Described in an informal way, if f_n converges to f uniformly, then the rate at which f_n(x) approaches f(x) is \\"uniform\\" throughout its domain in the following sense: in order to determine how large n needs to be to guarantee that f_n(x) falls within a certain distance \\\\epsilon of f(x), we do not need to know the value of x\\\\in E in question ‚Äî there is a single value of N=N(\\\\epsilon) independent of x, such that choosing n to be larger than N will suffice. The difference between uniform convergence and pointwise convergence was not fully appreciated early in the history of calculus, leading to instances of faulty reasoning. The concept, which was first formalized by Karl Weierstrass, is important because several properties of the functions f_n, such as continuity, Riemann integrability, and, with additional hypotheses, differentiability, are transferred to the limit f if the convergence is uniform, but not necessarily if the convergence is not uniform.  History  In 1821 Augustin-Louis Cauchy published a proof that a convergent sum of continuous functions is always continuous, to which Niels Henrik Abel in 1826 found purported counterexamples in the context of Fourier series, arguing that Cauchy's proof had to be incorrect. Completely standard notions of convergence did not exist at the time, and Cauchy handled convergence using infinitesimal methods. When put into the modern language, what Cauchy proved is that a uniformly convergent sequence of continuous functions has a continuous limit. The failure of a merely pointwise-convergent limit of continuous functions to converge to a continuous function illustrates the importance of distinguishing between different types of convergence when handling sequences of functions. The term uniform convergence was probably first used by Christoph Gudermann, in an 1838 paper on elliptic functions, where he employed the phrase \\"convergence in a uniform way\\" when the \\"mode of convergence\\" of a series \\\\textstyle{\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty f_n(x,\\\\phi,\\\\psi)} is independent of the variables \\\\phi and \\\\psi. While he thought it a \\"remarkable fact\\" when a series converged in this way, he did not give a formal definition, nor use the property in any of his proofs. Later Gudermann's pupil Karl Weierstrass, who attended his course on elliptic functions in 1839‚Äì1840, coined the term gleichm√§√üig konvergent () which he used in his 1841 paper Zur Theorie der Potenzreihen, published in 1894. Independently, similar concepts were articulated by Philipp Ludwig von Seidel and George Gabriel Stokes. G. H. Hardy compares the three definitions in his paper \\"Sir George Stokes and the concept of uniform convergence\\" and remarks: \\"Weierstrass's discovery was the earliest, and he alone fully realized its far-reaching importance as one of the fundamental ideas of analysis.\\" Under the influence of Weierstrass and Bernhard Riemann this concept and related questions were intensely studied at the end of the 19th century by Hermann Hankel, Paul du Bois-Reymond, Ulisse Dini, Cesare Arzel√† and others.  Definition  We first define uniform convergence for real-valued functions, although the concept is readily generalized to functions mapping to metric spaces and, more generally, uniform spaces (see below). Suppose E is a set and (f_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\N} is a sequence of real-valued functions on it. We say the sequence (f_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\N} is uniformly convergent on E with limit f: E \\\\to \\\\R if for every \\\\epsilon > 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all n \\\\geq N and x \\\\in E :f_n(x)-f(x)<\\\\epsilon. The notation for uniform convergence of f_n to f is not quite standardized and different authors have used a variety of symbols, including (in roughly decreasing order of popularity): :f_n\\\\rightrightarrows f, \\\\quad \\\\underset{n\\\\to\\\\infty}{\\\\mathrm{unif\\\\ lim}}f_n = f, \\\\quad f_n \\\\overset{\\\\mathrm{unif.}}{\\\\longrightarrow} f. Frequently, no special symbol is used, and authors simply write :f_n\\\\to f \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{uniformly} to indicate that convergence is uniform. (In contrast, the expression f_n\\\\to f on E without an adverb is taken to mean pointwise convergence on E: for all x \\\\in E , f_n(x)\\\\to f(x) as n\\\\to\\\\infty.) Since \\\\R is a complete metric space, the Cauchy criterion can be used to give an equivalent alternative formulation for uniform convergence: (f_n)_{n\\\\in\\\\N} converges uniformly on E (in the previous sense) if and only if for every \\\\epsilon > 0 , there exists a natural number N such that :x\\\\in E, m,n\\\\geq N \\\\implies f_m(x)-f_n(x)<\\\\epsilon. In yet another equivalent formulation, if we define : d_n = \\\\sup_{x\\\\in E} f_n(x) - f(x) , then f_n converges to f uniformly if and only if d_n\\\\to 0 as n\\\\to\\\\infty. Thus, we can characterize uniform convergence of (f_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\N} on E as (simple) convergence of (f_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\N} in the function space \\\\R^E with respect to the uniform metric (also called the supremum metric), defined by :d(f,g)=\\\\sup_{x\\\\in E} f(x)-g(x). Symbolically, :f_n\\\\rightrightarrows f\\\\iff \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} d(f_n,f)= 0. The sequence (f_n)_{n \\\\in \\\\N} is said to be locally uniformly convergent with limit f if E is a metric space and for every x\\\\in E, there exists an r > 0 such that (f_n) converges uniformly on B(x,r)\\\\cap E. It is clear that uniform convergence implies local uniform convergence, which implies pointwise convergence. = Notes = Intuitively, a sequence of functions f_n converges uniformly to f if, given an arbitrarily small \\\\epsilon>0, we can find an N\\\\in\\\\N so that the functions f_n with n>N all fall within a \\"tube\\" of width 2\\\\epsilon centered around f (i.e., between f(x)-\\\\epsilon and f(x)+\\\\epsilon) for the entire domain of the function. Note that interchanging the order of quantifiers in the definition of uniform convergence by moving \\"for all x\\\\in E\\" in front of \\"there exists a natural number N\\" results in a definition of pointwise convergence of the sequence. To make this difference explicit, in the case of uniform convergence, N=N(\\\\epsilon) can only depend on \\\\epsilon, and the choice of N has to work for all x\\\\in E, for a specific value of \\\\epsilon that is given. In contrast, in the case of pointwise convergence, N=N(\\\\epsilon,x) may depend on both \\\\epsilon and x, and the choice of N only has to work for the specific values of \\\\epsilon and x that are given. Thus uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence, however the converse is not true, as the example in the section below illustrates. = Generalizations = One may straightforwardly extend the concept to functions E ‚Üí M, where (M, d) is a metric space, by replacing f_n(x)-f(x)with d(f_n(x),f(x)). The most general setting is the uniform convergence of nets of functions E ‚Üí X, where X is a uniform space. We say that the net (f_\\\\alpha) converges uniformly with limit f : E ‚Üí X if and only if for every entourage V in X, there exists an \\\\alpha_0, such that for every x in E and every \\\\alpha\\\\geq \\\\alpha_0, (f_\\\\alpha(x),f(x)) is in V. In this situation, uniform limit of continuous functions remains continuous. =Definition in a hyperreal setting= Uniform convergence admits a simplified definition in a hyperreal setting. Thus, a sequence f_n converges to f uniformly if for all x in the domain of f^* and all infinite n, f_n^*(x) is infinitely close to f^*(x) (see microcontinuity for a similar definition of uniform continuity).  Examples  Given a topological space X, we can equip the space of bounded real or complex-valued functions over X with the uniform norm topology, with the uniform metric defined by :d(f,g)=\\\\f-g\\\\_{\\\\infty}=\\\\sup_{x\\\\in X} f(x)-g(x). Then uniform convergence simply means convergence in the uniform norm topology: :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\f_n-f\\\\_{\\\\infty}=0. The sequence of functions (f_n) :\\\\begin{cases} f_n:[0,1]\\\\to [0,1] \\\\\\\\\\\\ f_n(x)=x^n \\\\end{cases} is a classic example of a sequence of functions that converges to a function f pointwise but not uniformly. To show this, we first observe that the pointwise limit of (f_n) as n\\\\to\\\\infty is the function f, given by : f(x) = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to \\\\infty} f_n(x) = \\\\begin{cases} 0, & x \\\\in [0,1); \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1, & x=1. \\\\end{cases} Pointwise convergence: Convergence is trivial for x=0 and x=1, since f_n(0)=f(0)=0 and f_n(1)=f(1)=1, for all n. For x \\\\in (0,1) and given \\\\epsilon>0, we can ensure that f_n(x)-f(x)<\\\\epsilon whenever n\\\\geq N by choosing N = \\\\lceil\\\\log\\\\epsilon/\\\\log x\\\\rceil (here the upper square brackets indicate rounding up, see ceiling function). Hence, f_n\\\\to f pointwise for all x\\\\in[0,1]. Note that the choice of N depends on the value of \\\\epsilon and x. Moreover, for a fixed choice of \\\\epsilon, N (which cannot be defined to be smaller) grows without bound as x approaches 1. These observations preclude the possibility of uniform convergence. Non-uniformity of convergence: The convergence is not uniform, because we can find an \\\\epsilon>0 so that no matter how large we choose N, there will be values of x \\\\in [0,1] and n \\\\geq N such that f_n(x)-f(x)\\\\geq\\\\epsilon. To see this, first observe that regardless of how large n becomes, there is always an x_0 \\\\in [0,1) such that f_n(x_0)=1/2. Thus, if we choose \\\\epsilon = 1/4, we can never find an N such that f_n(x)-f(x)<\\\\epsilon for all x\\\\in[0,1] and n\\\\geq N. Explicitly, whatever candidate we choose for N, consider the value of f_N at x_0 = (1/2)^{1/N}. Since : \\\\left f_N(x_0)-f(x_0) \\\\right =\\\\left \\\\left [ (1/2)^{\\\\frac{1}{N}} \\\\right ]^N-0 \\\\right = \\\\frac{1}{2} > \\\\frac{1}{4} =\\\\epsilon, the candidate fails because we have found an example of an x\\\\in[0,1] that \\"escaped\\" our attempt to \\"confine\\" each f_n\\\\ (n\\\\geq N) to within \\\\epsilon of f for all x\\\\in[0,1]. In fact, it is easy to see that :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\f_n-f\\\\_{\\\\infty}=1, contrary to the requirement that \\\\f_n-f\\\\_{\\\\infty}\\\\to 0 if f_n\\\\rightrightarrows f. In this example one can easily see that pointwise convergence does not preserve differentiability or continuity. While each function of the sequence is smooth, that is to say that for all n, f_n\\\\in C^{\\\\infty}([0,1]), the limit \\\\lim_{n\\\\to \\\\infty}f_n is not even continuous. = Exponential function = The series expansion of the exponential function can be shown to be uniformly convergent on any bounded subset S \\\\subset \\\\C using the Weierstrass M-test. Theorem (Weierstrass M-test). Let (f_n) be a sequence of functions f_n:E\\\\to \\\\C and let M_n be a sequence of positive real numbers such that f_n(x)for all x\\\\in E and n=1,2, 3, \\\\ldots If \\\\sum_n M_n converges, then \\\\sum_n f_n converges uniformly on E. The complex exponential function can be expressed as the series: :\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{z^n}{n!}. Any bounded subset is a subset of some disc D_R of radius R, centered on the origin in the complex plane. The Weierstrass M-test requires us to find an upper bound M_n on the terms of the series, with M_n independent of the position in the disc: :\\\\left\\\\frac{z^n}{n!} \\\\right\\\\le M_n, \\\\forall z\\\\in D_R. To do this, we notice :\\\\left\\\\frac{z^n}{n!}\\\\right\\\\le \\\\frac{z^n}{n!} \\\\le \\\\frac{R^n}{n!} and take M_n=\\\\tfrac{R^n}{n!}. If \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}M_n is convergent, then the M-test asserts that the original series is uniformly convergent. The ratio test can be used here: :\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\frac{M_{n+1}}{M_n}=\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\frac{R^{n+1}}{R^n}\\\\frac{n!}{(n+1)!}=\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\frac{R}{n+1}=0 which means the series over M_n is convergent. Thus the original series converges uniformly for all z\\\\in D_R, and since S\\\\subset D_R, the series is also uniformly convergent on S.  Properties  * Every uniformly convergent sequence is locally uniformly convergent. * Every locally uniformly convergent sequence is compactly convergent. * For locally compact spaces local uniform convergence and compact convergence coincide. * A sequence of continuous functions on metric spaces, with the image metric space being complete, is uniformly convergent if and only if it is uniformly Cauchy. * If S is a compact interval (or in general a compact topological space), and (f_n) is a monotone increasing sequence (meaning f_n(x) \\\\leq f_{n+1}(x) for all n and x) of continuous functions with a pointwise limit f which is also continuous, then the convergence is necessarily uniform (Dini's theorem). Uniform convergence is also guaranteed if S is a compact interval and (f_n) is an equicontinuous sequence that converges pointwise.  Applications  =To continuity= Counterexample to a strengthening of the uniform convergence theorem, in which pointwise convergence, rather than uniform convergence, is assumed. The continuous green functions \\\\sin^n(x) converge to the non- continuous red function. This can happen only if convergence is not uniform. If E and M are topological spaces, then it makes sense to talk about the continuity of the functions f_n,f:E\\\\to M. If we further assume that M is a metric space, then (uniform) convergence of the f_n to f is also well defined. The following result states that continuity is preserved by uniform convergence: : Uniform limit theorem. Suppose E is a topological space, M is a metric space, and (f_n) is a sequence of continuous functions f_n:E\\\\to M. If f_n\\\\rightrightarrows f on E, then f is also continuous. This theorem is proved by the \\" trick\\", and is the archetypal example of this trick: to prove a given inequality (), one uses the definitions of continuity and uniform convergence to produce 3 inequalities (), and then combines them via the triangle inequality to produce the desired inequality. This theorem is an important one in the history of real and Fourier analysis, since many 18th century mathematicians had the intuitive understanding that a sequence of continuous functions always converges to a continuous function. The image above shows a counterexample, and many discontinuous functions could, in fact, be written as a Fourier series of continuous functions. The erroneous claim that the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous (originally stated in terms of convergent series of continuous functions) is infamously known as \\"Cauchy's wrong theorem\\". The uniform limit theorem shows that a stronger form of convergence, uniform convergence, is needed to ensure the preservation of continuity in the limit function. More precisely, this theorem states that the uniform limit of uniformly continuous functions is uniformly continuous; for a locally compact space, continuity is equivalent to local uniform continuity, and thus the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous. =To differentiability= If S is an interval and all the functions f_n are differentiable and converge to a limit f, it is often desirable to determine the derivative function f' by taking the limit of the sequence f'_n. This is however in general not possible: even if the convergence is uniform, the limit function need not be differentiable (not even if the sequence consists of everywhere-analytic functions, see Weierstrass function), and even if it is differentiable, the derivative of the limit function need not be equal to the limit of the derivatives. Consider for instance f_n(x) = n^{-1/2}{\\\\sin(nx)} with uniform limit f_n\\\\rightrightarrows f\\\\equiv 0. Clearly, f' is also identically zero. However, the derivatives of the sequence of functions are given by f'_n(x)=n^{1/2}\\\\cos nx, and the sequence f'_n does not converge to f', or even to any function at all. In order to ensure a connection between the limit of a sequence of differentiable functions and the limit of the sequence of derivatives, the uniform convergence of the sequence of derivatives plus the convergence of the sequence of functions at at least one point is required:Rudin, Walter (1976). Principles of Mathematical Analysis 3rd edition, Theorem 7.17. McGraw-Hill: New York. : If (f_n) is a sequence of differentiable functions on [a,b] such that \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} f_n(x_0) exists (and is finite) for some x_0\\\\in[a,b] and the sequence (f'_n) converges uniformly on [a,b], then f_n converges uniformly to a function f on [a,b], and f'(x) = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to \\\\infty} f'_n(x) for x \\\\in [a, b]. =To integrability= Similarly, one often wants to exchange integrals and limit processes. For the Riemann integral, this can be done if uniform convergence is assumed: : If (f_n)_{n=1}^\\\\infty is a sequence of Riemann integrable functions defined on a compact interval I which uniformly converge with limit f, then f is Riemann integrable and its integral can be computed as the limit of the integrals of the f_n: :: \\\\int_I f = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\int_I f_n. In fact, for a uniformly convergent family of bounded functions on an interval, the upper and lower Riemann integrals converge to the upper and lower Riemann integrals of the limit function. This follows because, for n sufficiently large, the graph of f_n is within of the graph of f, and so the upper sum and lower sum of f_n are each within \\\\varepsilon Iof the value of the upper and lower sums of f, respectively. Much stronger theorems in this respect, which require not much more than pointwise convergence, can be obtained if one abandons the Riemann integral and uses the Lebesgue integral instead. =To analyticity= If a sequence of analytic functions converges uniformly in a region S of the complex plane, then the limit is analytic in S. This example demonstrates that complex functions are more well-behaved than real functions, since the uniform limit of analytic functions on a real interval need not even be differentiable (see Weierstrass function). =To series= We say that \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty f_n converges: i) pointwise on E if and only if the sequence of partial sums s_n(x)=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n} f_j(x) converges for every x\\\\in E. ii) uniformly on E if and only if sn converges uniformly as n\\\\to\\\\infty. iii) absolutely on E if and only if \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty f_nconverges for every x\\\\in E. With this definition comes the following result: > Let x0 be contained in the set E and each fn be continuous at x0. If > \\\\textstyle f=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty f_n converges uniformly on E then f is > continuous at x0 in E. Suppose that E=[a,b] and each fn is integrable on E. > If \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty f_n converges uniformly on E then f is > integrable on E and the series of integrals of fn is equal to integral of > the series of fn. Almost uniform convergence If the domain of the functions is a measure space E then the related notion of almost uniform convergence can be defined. We say a sequence of functions (f_n) converges almost uniformly on E if for every \\\\delta > 0 there exists a measurable set E_\\\\delta with measure less than \\\\delta such that the sequence of functions (f_n) converges uniformly on E \\\\setminus E_\\\\delta. In other words, almost uniform convergence means there are sets of arbitrarily small measure for which the sequence of functions converges uniformly on their complement. Note that almost uniform convergence of a sequence does not mean that the sequence converges uniformly almost everywhere as might be inferred from the name. However, Egorov's theorem does guarantee that on a finite measure space, a sequence of functions that converges almost everywhere also converges almost uniformly on the same set. Almost uniform convergence implies almost everywhere convergence and convergence in measure.

He was portrayed by Anthony Perkins in the 1960 version of Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock and the Psycho franchise. He was also portrayed by Vince Vaughn in the 1998 version of Psycho, and by Freddie Highmore in the television series Bates Motel (2013‚Äì2017). Unlike the franchise produced by Universal Studios, Norman is not the principal antagonist in Bloch's subsequent novels and is succeeded by copycat killers who assume Norman's identity after his death in Psycho II (1982). There is a wide-ranging assumption that the character was inspired by the Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein. Bloch later revealed that he had already started writing Psycho when he first became aware of Gein, and was struck by \\"how closely the imaginary character I'd created resembled the real Ed Gein both in overt act and apparent motivation.\\" Character overview Both the 1959 novel, and its 1960 film adaptation explain that Norman suffered severe emotional abuse as a child at the hands of his mother, Norma, who preached to him that sexual intercourse was sinful and that all women (except herself) were whores. The novel also suggests that their relationship may have been incestuous. After Norman's father died, Norman and his mother lived alone together \\"as if there was no one else in the world\\" until Norman reached adolescence, when his mother met Joe Considine (Chet Rudolph in Psycho IV: The Beginning) and planned to marry. Considine eventually convinced Norma to open a motel. Driven over the edge with jealousy, Norman murdered both of them with strychnine. After committing the murders, Norman staged it like murder‚Äìsuicide, making it look as if Norma had killed her fianc√© and then herself. After a brief hospitalization for shock, he developed dissociative identity disorder, assuming his mother's personality to repress his awareness of her death and to escape the guilt of murdering her. He inherited his mother's house‚Äîwhere he kept her corpse in the fruit cellar‚Äîand the family motel in the fictional small town of Fairvale, California. As \\"Mother\\", he commits murder against anyone that he believes Norma would want to kill if she were still alive. After each \\"Mother\\" trance, he does not appear to remember committing the murders himself, believing \\"Mother\\" to be wholly responsible. Bloch sums up Norman's multiple personalities in his stylistic form of puns: \\"Norman\\", a child needing his mother; \\"Norma\\", a possessive mother who kills anyone who threatens the illusion of her existence; and \\"Normal\\", a functional adult who goes through the motions of day-to-day life. \\"Norma\\" dominates and belittles \\"Norman\\" much as she had when she was alive, forbidding him to have a life outside of her and flying into violent rages whenever he feels attracted to a woman. \\"Norma\\" and \\"Norman\\" carry on conversations through Norman talking to himself and to her corpse in his mother's voice, and Norman dresses in his mother's clothes whenever \\"Norma\\" takes hold completely. Psycho (novel and film) In Bloch's 1959 novel and the 1960 Hitchcock film, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a young woman on the run after stealing money from her employer, checks into the motel one night. Norman is smitten with her, and shyly asks her to have dinner with him in the house. \\"Mother\\" flies into a rage and threatens to kill Marion if Norman lets her in the house. Norman defies her and eats dinner with Marion anyway, but lashes out at her when she suggests that he institutionalize his mother. When Marion goes to her room to shower, Norman spies on her through a peephole he drilled in the wall. \\"Mother\\" takes control and stabs Marion to death (she beheads her in the novel). When Norman awakes to discover what he believes his mother has done, he sinks Marion's car‚Äîwith her corpse and the money in the trunk‚Äîinto a nearby swamp. As \\"Mother\\", he also murders Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), a private detective hired by Marion's employer, days later. Norman is finally caught when Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), arrive at the motel looking for her. When Norman figures out what they want, he knocks Sam out and goes running after Lila, who has reached the house and found Mrs. Bates' corpse. He attacks her as \\"Mother\\", but Sam, after awakening from having been knocked out, overpowers him, and Norman is finally arrested. Norman is declared insane and sent to an institution, where \\"Mother\\" takes complete, and permanent, control of his mind: he becomes his mother. Novel sequels =Psycho II= In Bloch's 1982 sequel to his first novel, Psycho II, Norman escapes from the psychiatric hospital by killing a nun and donning her habit. Picked up as a hitchhiker, Norman tries to attack the driver with a tire iron, but the driver overpowers him. This in turn causes a fiery accident where the driver escapes, but Norman dies. Meanwhile, Dr. Adam Claiborne, who discovered Norman's corpse, assumes his personality and goes on a killing spree. =Psycho House= In Bloch's 1990 sequel to his second novel, Psycho House, Norman appears only as a novelty animatronic on display in the Bates Motel, which has been converted into a tourist attraction. =Psycho: Sanitarium= In Chet Williamson's 2016 prequel to the second novel, Psycho: Sanitarium, Dr. Felix Reed tries to bring Norman out of a catatonic state. Sanitarium introduces Robert Newman, Norman's twin brother who was taken away at birth after the attending doctor pronounced him brain damaged. As Robert and Norman grow to know each other, Norman senses a darkness in Robert, even deeper than that which has lurked in Norman himself. Film sequels =Psycho II= In 1983's Psycho II, the first sequel to the original film, Norman is released from the institution twenty-two years after his arrest, seemingly cured. He meets Mary Samuels (Meg Tilly)‚Äîlater revealed to be Mary Loomis, Lila and Sam Loomis's daughter and Marion Crane's niece‚Äîand falls in love with her. However, a series of mysterious murders occurs, as well as strange appearances and messages from his mother, and Norman slowly loses his grip on sanity. The mysterious appearances and messages turn out to be a plot by Lila to drive him insane again in order to get him recommitted. The actual murders turn out to be the work of Norman's coworker, Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar). Before Norman discovers this, however, Mary Loomis is shot dead by the police during a confrontation with Norman, and Mrs. Spool murders Lila. When Spool tells Norman that she is his real mother, he kills her and embalms her corpse while assuming the \\"Mother\\" personality once again. =Psycho III= In 1986's Psycho III, set a month later, Norman continues to struggle, unsuccessfully, against \\"Mother\\"'s dominion. He also finds another love interest named Maureen Coyle (Diana Scarwid), who eventually dies at \\"Mother\\"'s hand. In the film, Mrs. Spool's corpse is first discovered by sleazy musician Duane Duke (Jeff Fahey), whom Norman kills when Duke tries to use the discovery to blackmail Norman. Tracy Venable (Roberta Maxwell), a reporter interested in Norman's case, finds out that Spool was in fact Norman's aunt ‚Äî Norma Bates' sister ‚Äî who was in love with Norman's father and killed him when he chose Norma over her. She then kidnapped the child Norman, believing him to be her own, but she was arrested and institutionalized, leaving Norman to be raised by Norma. \\"Mother\\" orders Norman to kill Tracy, but in the end he destroys Spool's corpse, attempting to break free of her control. He is then arrested and put back in the institution. =Psycho IV: The Beginning= Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990), the final film in the series, retcons the revelations of the second and third film, supplying that Norman's father was stung to death by bees and removing all references to Emma Spool. In this film, Norman has been released from an institution, and is married to one of the hospital's psychologists, a woman named Connie (Donna Mitchell). When his wife becomes pregnant, he lures her to his mother's house and tries to kill her, wanting to prevent another of his \\"cursed\\" line from being born into the world; the film implies that Mrs. Bates (Olivia Hussey) suffered from schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder and passed the illnesses on to her son. However, he relents at the last minute, when Connie professes her love for him. He then burns the house down in an attempt to free himself of his past. During the attempt, he is tormented by hallucinations of \\"Mother\\" and several of his victims. He almost dies in the flames before willing himself to get out, apparently defeating his illness at long last; he is finally free of his mother's voice, which demands to be let out. This was Anthony Perkins' final performance as Norman Bates; Henry Thomas portrayed Norman as a teenager. Television =Bates Motel (film)= In the 1987 television spin-off movie and series pilot Bates Motel, Norman is never released from the institution after his first incarceration. He befriends Alex West (Bud Cort), a fellow inmate who had murdered his stepfather, and wills ownership of the titular motel to him before dying of old age. =Bates Motel (TV series)= The TV series Bates Motel, a contemporary prequel to the 1960 film Psycho, set in the present day, depicts the young Norman Bates' life with his mother, Norma (Vera Farmiga). In this continuity, Norman suffers from hallucinations and blackouts, and begins manifesting his \\"Mother\\" personality while Norma is alive. He kills his abusive father, Sam (David Cubitt), while in a dissociative state, and Norma moves them from Arizona, where he was born and raised, to White Pine Bay, Oregon, to protect him. The series also introduces his maternal half-brother, Dylan Massett (Max Thieriot) and gives him a love interest in Emma Decody (Olivia Cooke), a classmate with cystic fibrosis. As \\"Mother\\", Norman murders Blaire Watson (Keegan Connor Tracy), one of his teachers who seduces him; Bradley Martin (Nicola Peltz), a girl he has feelings for; and Audrey Ellis Decody (Karina Logue), Emma's estranged mother. Fearing for his sanity, Norma briefly has him committed to a mental institution. While there, Norman recovers a memory of witnessing his father rape Norma; it is implied that this trauma fractured his psyche. When Norman's sanity begins to deteriorate, Norma marries the town sheriff, Alex Romero (Nestor Carbonell), so she can use his insurance coverage to pay for Norman to be treated in a mental institution. While the marriage is at first merely a financial arrangement, they eventually fall in love. After Norman is released from the institution and finds out that Norma is married, he grows insanely jealous and tries to kill both Norma and himself by flooding the house with carbon monoxide while his mother sleeps. Romero arrives at the house in time to revive Norman, but finds that Norma is already dead. Romero figures out what happened and swears revenge, but is arrested for perjury before he can do anything. Meanwhile, Norman cannot bear losing his mother, so he digs up her corpse and assumes her personality to preserve the illusion of her being alive. Two years later, Norman is running the motel and living alone in the house with Norma's corpse, which he keeps frozen and preserved in the cellar. He and his \\"Mother\\" personality live together as if there is no one else in the world, and she takes care of his problems - such as killing and disposing of a hitman sent by Romero and helping him get rid of his uncle, Norma's brother Caleb (Kenny Johnson), after he discovers the truth. Norman falls for Madeline Loomis (Isabelle McNally), a lonely woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Norma, and whose husband Sam (Austin Nichols) is cheating on her. \\"Mother\\" becomes jealous and starts behaving erratically, at one point taking possession of Norman's mind and making him have sex with a man at a gay bar while dressed in Norma's clothes. Norman finally begins to suspect that \\"Mother\\" is not real, and she confirms that he created her in his mind to deal with things that he could not, such as his abusive father. When Sam's mistress Marion Crane (Rihanna) checks into the motel, Norman has dinner with her and tells her that Sam is married. Marion comes back to the motel after confirming Sam's infidelity, and seeks comfort from Norman. He fears that \\"Mother\\" will kill her, however, and tells her to leave and never come back. When Sam comes to the motel to look for Marion, Norman stabs him to death in the shower. Dylan comes to see Norman after learning of Norma's death, and they get into a fight that ends with Norman assaulting his half-brother at \\"Mother\\"'s instigation. Terrified of what he might do, Norman calls 9-11 and confesses to murdering Sam. While he is in jail, Sheriff Jane Greene (Brooke Smith) finds the bodies of Norman's other victims, and charges him with their murders, as well. While Norman is awaiting trial, Romero - who had earlier escaped from prison - breaks into his cell and takes him hostage. They drive to the woods where Norman hid Norma's corpse after the police began searching his house. There, Norman gets the better of Romero and shoots him dead, but not before his former stepfather tells him he will never escape from murdering his own mother. When Norman finally admits to himself that he killed Norma, \\"Mother\\" appears to him and tells him she is leaving, as there is no longer anything she can protect him from. Now completely alone, Norman loses all contact with reality. He calls Dylan and invites him over for a \\"family dinner\\", complete with Norma's corpse seated at the head of the table. When Dylan tells him that Norma is dead, Norman flies into a rage and attacks him with a knife, forcing Dylan to shoot him in self-defense. As he dies, Norman sees a vision of his mother embracing him. Characterization The character Norman Bates in Psycho was loosely based on two people. First was the real-life murderer Ed Gein, about whom Bloch later wrote a fictionalized account, \\"The Shambles of Ed Gein\\", in 1962. (The story can be found in Crimes and Punishments: The Lost Bloch, Volume 3). Second, it has been indicated by several people, including Noel Carter (wife of Lin Carter) and Chris Steinbrunner, as well as allegedly by Bloch himself, that Norman Bates was partly based on Calvin Beck, publisher of Castle of Frankenstein. The characterization of Norman Bates in the novel and the movie differ in some key areas. In the novel, Norman is in his mid-to- late 40s, short, overweight and homely. In the movie, he is in his mid-20s, tall, slender, and handsome. Reportedly, when working on the film, Hitchcock decided that he wanted audiences to be able to sympathize with Norman and genuinely like the character, so he made him more of a \\"boy next door\\". In the novel, Norman becomes \\"Mother\\" after getting drunk and passing out; in the movie, he remains sober before switching personalities. In the novel, Norman is well-read in occult and esoteric authors such as P.D. Ouspensky and Aleister Crowley. He is aware that \\"Mother\\" disapproves of these authors as being against religion. Portrayals Norman Bates was portrayed by Anthony Perkins in Hitchcock's seminal 1960 film adaptation of Bloch's novel and its three sequels. Perkins hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live in 1976 in which he performed numerous sketches portraying Norman, including the instructional video \\"The Norman Bates School of Motel Management\\". He also portrayed Norman, albeit more lightheartedly, in a 1990 commercial for Oatmeal Crisp cereal. Vince Vaughn portrayed Norman in Gus Van Sant's 1998 version of Psycho, while Kurt Paul, Perkins' \\"Mother\\" stunt double in Psycho II and Psycho III, took on the role in the made-for-TV film spin-off Bates Motel. Perkins' son Oz portrayed a younger version of Norman in Psycho II. Henry Thomas played a younger version of the character in Psycho IV: The Beginning. Freddie Highmore portrayed Norman in the TV series Bates Motel. For his performance, Highmore was nominated twice for a Critic's Choice Award, a Saturn Award, and won a People's Choice Award in 2017. Comic books Norman appears in the 1992 three-issue comic book adaptation of the 1960 film Psycho released by Innovation Publishing. Despite being a colorized adaptation of the Hitchcock film, the version of Norman present in the comics resembles the one from Bloch's original novel: a middle-aged, overweight, balding man. Comic artist Felipe Echevarria has explained that this was due to Perkins' refusal to allow his likeness to be replicated for the books, wanting to disassociate himself with Norman Bates.

The label has released a variety of work in different genres, but was originally known for its commitment to underground punk rock bands and the Olympia area music scene.About Kill Rock Stars (Retrieved Mar. 1, 2004) History Sampson and Moon initially started the label because, in Moon's words, \\"I just wanted to put out my friends‚Äô records because nobody was putting out my friends‚Äô records. And to put out spoken word 7\\" records.\\" \\"Interview With Slim Moon\\", HitQuarters, 13 April 2009. KRS-101 (the label's first release) was in fact a split 7\\" spoken-word record with Kathleen Hanna and Slim Moon; other \\"Wordcore\\" releases followed. The first major release was a compilation of Olympia-area bands simply titled Kill Rock Stars (Stars Kill Rock and Rock Stars Kill would follow in the same compilation series) and featured Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Unwound, Nirvana, Mecca Normal, Heavens to Betsy, The Nation of Ulysses, and the Melvins, among others. Although the label's music has never reflected a singular genre or underground music movement, it is arguably most notable for releasing the work of various riot grrrl bands during the mid-'90s, some of which, especially Bikini Kill, generated a good deal of press attention. Other Kill Rock Stars releases in this genre includes albums by Bratmobile, Huggy Bear, Heavens to Betsy and Excuse 17. The label continued its tradition of spoken word by releasing their first full-length spoken word LP Big Broad by Juliana Luecking in 1995. This was also the year that Elliott Smith released his self-titled solo LP on the label. Another milestone was the 1997 release of Sleater-Kinney's third LP (and first on Kill Rock Stars) Dig Me Out, which garnered national press attention in Spin and Rolling Stone.Kill Rock Stars Timeline (Retrieved October 22, 2005) In 1997‚Äì98, the 5RC label was formed as a sister label to Kill Rock Stars; it released generally harsher-sounding and more experimental rock than Kill Rock Stars. The 5RC roster included Xiu Xiu, Deerhoof, Need New Body, The Mae Shi, The Robot Ate Me, and Metalux, among others. 1998 also marked the first-ever Mailorder Freak Singles Club, featuring Quasi, Small Stars, Sta-Prest, and Rock*A*Teens, among others. Another popular band on Kill Rock Stars was the Decemberists, who released three full-length albums on the label between 2001 and 2005. The band's singer, Colin Meloy, also released a solo album on the label in April 2008. Other notable releases by Kill Rock Stars include albums by the Paper Chase, Jeff Hanson, Unwound, Marnie Stern, the Gossip, Mecca Normal, Two Ton Boa and Comet Gain; spoken word albums by Kathy Acker and Miranda July; and reissues of work by earlier punk/post-punk bands such as Kleenex/Liliput, Essential Logic, and Delta 5. In October 2006, Slim Moon, the label's owner, announced he would be departing Kill Rock Stars to work as an A&R; representative at Nonesuch Records, a Warner Music Group subsidiary.Slim Moon Leaves KRS to work for Warner Music Group subsidiary Nonesuch Records (Retrieved October 6, 2006) Moon's wife, Portia Sabin, then took over ownership of Kill Rock Stars. In 2007, the label released eleven records, including New Moon, a collection of songs recorded by Elliott Smith between 1994 and 1997. The label has begun to further diversify its roster: since 2013, Kill Rock Stars has released albums by comedians including W. Kamau Bell, Nathan Brannon, Kurt Braunohler, Rhea Butcher, Cameron Esposito, Emily Heller, Hot Tub with Kurt and Kristen, Ian Karmel, Hari Kondabolu, and Amy Miller. In September 2019, Kill Rock Stars issued a press release announcing Slim Moon's return to management of the label after a thirteen-year hiatus, as well as the signing of Portland band MAITA; the press release described the signing as \\"both previous label head Portia Sabin‚Äôs last act and the first initiative of Slim Moon in his second tenure as guiding light of KRS\\".KILL ROCK STARS SIGNS MAITA (Retrieved October 22, 2019) See also * List of companies based in Oregon * List of record labels * List of Kill Rock Stars artists References External links KRS Music Video Podcast *Kill Rock Stars Label Spotlight *Interview with Slim Moon, HitQuarters Apr 2009 Record labels established in 1991 1991 establishments in Washington (state) Oregon record labels Privately held companies based in Oregon Companies based in Olympia, Washington Companies based in Portland, Oregon American independent record labels Rock record labels Alternative rock record labels Indie rock record labels Punk record labels Electronic music record labels Riot grrrl ","title":"Kill Rock Stars"},{"id":"50677","text":"HP LaserJet 4200 series printer, installed atop high-capacity paper feeder Laser printing is an electrostatic digital printing process. It produces high- quality text and graphics (and moderate-quality photographs) by repeatedly passing a laser beam back and forth over a negatively charged cylinder called a \\"drum\\" to define a differentially charged image. The drum then selectively collects electrically charged powdered ink (toner), and transfers the image to paper, which is then heated in order to permanently fuse the text, imagery, or both, to the paper. As with digital photocopiers, laser printers employ a xerographic printing process. Laser printing differs from traditional xerography as implemented in analog photocopiers in that in the latter, the image is formed by reflecting light off an existing document onto the exposed drum. Invented at Xerox PARC in the 1970s, laser printers were introduced for the office and then home markets in subsequent years by IBM, Canon, Xerox, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and many others. Over the decades, quality and speed have increased as the price has fallen, and the once cutting-edge printing devices are now ubiquitous. History Gary Starkweather (seen here in 2009) invented the laser printer. In the 1960s, the Xerox Corporation held a dominant position in the photocopier market. In 1969, Gary Starkweather, who worked in Xerox's product development department, had the idea of using a laser beam to \\"draw\\" an image of what was to be copied directly onto the copier drum. After transferring to the recently formed Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC) in 1971, Starkweather adapted a Xerox 7000 copier to create SLOT (Scanned Laser Output Terminal). In 1972, Starkweather worked with Butler Lampson and Ronald Rider to add a control system and character generator, resulting in a printer called EARS (Ethernet, Alto Research character generator, Scanned laser output terminal)‚Äîwhich later became the Xerox 9700 laser printer. * 1973: The Xerox 1200 was \\"the first commercial laser printer.\\" A Xerox 2012 lookback described it as the \\"first commercial non-impact Xerographic printer for computer output.\\" Input was either from magnetic tape or directly from a mainframe computer. The technology came from the Xerox 3600 copier. * 1976: The first commercial implementation of a laser printer was the IBM 3800 in 1976. It was designed for data centers, where it replaced line printers attached to mainframe computers. The IBM 3800 was used for high-volume printing on continuous stationery, and achieved speeds of 215 pages per minute (ppm), at a resolution of 240 dots per inch (dpi). Over 8,000 of these printers were sold. * 1977: The Xerox 9700 was brought to market in 1977. Unlike the IBM 3800, the Xerox 9700 was not targeted to replace any particular existing printers; but, it did have limited support for the loading of fonts. The Xerox 9700 excelled at printing high-value documents on cut- sheet paper with varying content (e.g. insurance policies). * 1979: In 1979, inspired by the Xerox 9700's commercial success, Japanese camera and optics company, Canon, developed a low-cost, desktop laser printer: the Canon LBP-10. Canon then began work on a much-improved print engine, the Canon CX, resulting in the LBP-CX printer. Having no experience in selling to computer users, Canon sought partnerships with three Silicon Valley companies: Diablo Data Systems (who rejected the offer), Hewlett-Packard (HP), and Apple Computer. * 1981: The first laser printer designed for office use reached market in 1981: the Xerox Star 8010. The system used a desktop metaphor that was unsurpassed in commercial sales, until the Apple Macintosh. Although it was innovative, the Star workstation was a prohibitively expensive () system, affordable only to a fraction of the businesses and institutions at which it was targeted. * 1984: The first laser printer intended for mass-market sales was the HP LaserJet, released in 1984; it used the Canon CX engine, controlled by HP software. The LaserJet was quickly followed by printers from Brother Industries, IBM, and others. In May, Interleaf shipped its first electronic publishing system, based on a Sun workstation and a Canon LBP 10 laser printer with an Interleaf RIP. First-generation machines had large photosensitive drums, of circumference greater than the loaded paper's length. Once faster- recovery coatings were developed, the drums could touch the paper multiple times in a pass, and therefore be smaller in diameter. * 1985: Apple introduced the LaserWriter (also based on the Canon CX engine), but used the newly released PostScript page-description language. Up until this point, each manufacturer used its own proprietary page-description language, making the supporting software complex and expensive. PostScript allowed the use of text, fonts, graphics, images, and color largely independent of the printer's brand or resolution. PageMaker, written by Aldus for the Macintosh and LaserWriter, was also released in 1985 and the combination became very popular for desktop publishing. Laser printers brought exceptionally fast and high-quality text printing in multiple fonts on a page, to the business and consumer markets. No other commonly available printer during this era could also offer this combination of features. * 1995: Xerox ran magazine print ads headlined \\"Who invented the laser printer?\\" and answered \\"it's Xerox.\\" Printing process Diagram of a laser printer The sound of a laser printer A laser beam (typically, an aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) semiconductor laser that can emit red or infrared light) projects an image of the page to be printed onto an electrically charged, selenium-coated, rotating, cylindrical drum (or, more commonly in subsequent versions, a drum called an organic photoconductor made of N-vinylcarbazole, an organic monomer). Photoconductivity allows the charged electrons to fall away from the areas exposed to light. Powdered ink (toner) particles are then electrostatically attracted to the charged areas of the drum that have not been laser-beamed. The drum then transfers the image onto paper (which is passed through the machine) by direct contact. Finally, the paper is passed onto a finisher, which uses heat to instantly fuse the toner that represents the image onto the paper. There are typically seven steps involved in the process: =Raster image processing= The document to be printed is encoded in a page description language such as PostScript, Printer Command Language (PCL), or Open XML Paper Specification (OpenXPS). The raster image processor (RIP) converts the page description into a bitmap which is stored in the printer's raster memory. Each horizontal strip of dots across the page is known as a raster line or scan line. Laser printing differs from other printing technologies in that each page is always rendered in a single continuous process without any pausing in the middle, while other technologies like inkjet can pause every few lines. To avoid a buffer underrun (where the laser reaches a point on the page before it has the dots to draw there), a laser printer typically needs enough raster memory to hold the bitmap image of an entire page. Memory requirements increase with the square of the dots per inch, so 600 dpi requires a minimum of 4 megabytes for monochrome, and 16 megabytes for color (still at 600 dpi). For fully graphical output using a page description language, a minimum of 1 megabyte of memory is needed to store an entire monochrome letter/A4 sized page of dots at 300 dpi. At 300 dpi, there are 90,000 dots per square inch (300 dots per linear inch). A typical 8.5 √ó 11 sheet of paper has margins, reducing the printable area to , or 84 square inches. 84 sq/in √ó 90,000 dots per sq/in = 7,560,000 dots. 1 megabyte = 1,048,576 bytes, or 8,388,608 bits, which is just large enough to hold the entire page at 300 dpi, leaving about 100 kilobytes to spare for use by the raster image processor. In a color printer, each of the four CMYK toner layers is stored as a separate bitmap, and all four layers are typically preprocessed before printing begins, so a minimum of 4 megabytes is needed for a full-color letter-size page at 300 dpi. During the 1980s, memory chips were still very expensive, which is why entry-level laser printers in that era always came with four-digit suggested retail prices in US dollars. Memory prices later plunged, while improvements in the performance of personal computers and peripheral cables enabled the development of low-end laser printers which offload rasterization to the sending PC. For such printers, the operating system's print spooler renders the raw bitmap of each page into the PC's system memory at the target resolution, then sends that bitmap directly to the laser (at the expense of slowing down all other programs on the sending PC). Thus, 1200 dpi printers have been widely available in the consumer market since 2008. 2400 dpi electrophotographic printing plate makers, essentially laser printers that print on plastic sheets, are also available. =Charging= Applying a negative charge to the photosensitive drum In older printers, a corona wire positioned parallel to the drum or, in more recent printers, a primary charge roller, projects an electrostatic charge onto the photoreceptor (otherwise named the photoconductor unit), a revolving photosensitive drum or belt, which is capable of holding an electrostatic charge on its surface while it is in the dark. An AC bias voltage is applied to the primary charge roller to remove any residual charges left by previous images. The roller will also apply a DC bias on the drum surface to ensure a uniform negative potential. Numerous patents describe the photosensitive drum coating as a silicon sandwich with a photocharging layer, a charge leakage barrier layer, as well as a surface layer. One version uses amorphous silicon containing hydrogen as the light receiving layer, Boron nitride as a charge leakage barrier layer, as well as a surface layer of doped silicon, notably silicon with oxygen or nitrogen which at sufficient concentration resembles machining silicon nitride. =Exposing= Laser light selectively neutralizes the negative charge on the photoreceptive drum, to form an electrostatic image Laser unit from a Dell P1500. The white hexagon is the rotating scanner mirror. A laser printer uses a laser because lasers are able to form highly focused, precise, and intense beams of light, especially over the short distances inside of a printer. The laser is aimed at a rotating polygonal mirror which directs the light beam through a system of lenses and mirrors onto the photoreceptor drum, writing pixels at rates up to sixty-five million times per second. The drum continues to rotate during the sweep, and the angle of sweep is canted very slightly to compensate for this motion. The stream of rasterized data held in the printer's memory rapidly turns the laser on and off as it sweeps. The laser beam neutralizes (or reverses) the charge on the surface of the drum, leaving a static electric negative image on the drum's surface which will repel the negatively charged toner particles. The areas on the drum which were struck by the laser, however, momentarily have no charge, and the toner being pressed against the drum by the toner-coated developer roll in the next step moves from the roll's rubber surface to the charged portions of the surface of the drum. Some non-laser printers (LED printers) use an array of light-emitting diodes spanning the width of the page to generate an image, rather than using a laser. \\"Exposing\\" is also known as \\"writing\\" in some documentation. =Developing= As the drums rotate, toner is continuously applied in a 15-micron-thick layer to the developer roll. The surface of the photoreceptor with the latent image is exposed to the toner- covered developer roll. Toner consists of fine particles of dry plastic powder mixed with carbon black or coloring agents. The toner particles are given a negative charge inside the toner cartridge, and as they emerge onto the developer drum they are electrostatically attracted to the photoreceptor's latent image (the areas on the surface of the drum which had been struck by the laser). Because negative charges repel each other, the negatively charged toner particles will not adhere to the drum where the negative charge (imparted previously by the charge roller) remains. =Transferring= A sheet of paper is then rolled under the photoreceptor drum, which has been coated with a pattern of toner particles in the exact places where the laser struck it moments before. The toner particles have a very weak attraction to both the drum and the paper, but the bond to the drum is weaker and the particles transfer once again, this time from the drum's surface to the paper's surface. Some machines also use a positively charged \\"transfer roller\\" on the backside of the paper to help pull the negatively charged toner from the photoreceptor drum to the paper. =Fusing= Toner is fused onto paper with heat and pressure The paper passes through rollers in the fuser assembly, where temperatures up to and pressure are used to permanently bond the toner to the paper. One roller is usually a hollow tube (heat roller) and the other is a rubber backed roller (pressure roller). A radiant heat lamp is suspended in the center of the hollow tube, and its infrared energy uniformly heats the roller from the inside. For proper bonding of the toner, the fuser roller must be uniformly hot. Some printers use a very thin flexible metal foil roller, so there is less thermal mass to be heated and the fuser can more quickly reach operating temperature. If paper moves through the fuser more slowly, there is more roller contact time for the toner to melt, and the fuser can operate at a lower temperature. Smaller, inexpensive laser printers typically print slowly, due to this energy-saving design, compared to large high-speed printers where paper moves more rapidly through a high-temperature fuser with very short contact time. =Cleaning and recharging= Magnification of color laser printer output, showing individual toner particles comprising 4 dots of an image with a bluish background As the drum completes a revolution, it is exposed to an electrically neutral soft plastic blade that cleans any remaining toner from the photoreceptor drum and deposits it into a waste reservoir. A charge roller then re-establishes a uniform negative charge on the surface of the now clean drum, readying it to be struck again by the laser. =Continuous printing= Once the raster image generation is complete, all steps of the printing process can occur one after the other in rapid succession. This permits the use of a very small and compact unit, where the photoreceptor is charged, rotates a few degrees and is scanned, rotates a few more degrees, and is developed, and so forth. The entire process can be completed before the drum completes one revolution. Different printers implement these steps in distinct ways. LED printers use a linear array of light-emitting diodes to \\"write\\" the light on the drum. The toner is based on either wax or plastic, so that when the paper passes through the fuser assembly, the particles of toner melt. The paper may or may not be oppositely charged. The fuser can be an infrared oven, a heated pressure roller, or (on some very fast, expensive printers) a xenon flash lamp. The warmup process that a laser printer goes through when power is initially applied to the printer consists mainly of heating the fuser element. =Malfunctions= The mechanism inside a laser printer is somewhat delicate and, once damaged, often impossible to repair. The drum, in particular, is a critical component: it must not be left exposed to ambient light for more than a few hours, as light is what causes it to lose its charge and will eventually wear it out. Anything that interferes with the operation of the laser such as a scrap of torn paper may prevent the laser from discharging some portion of the drum, causing those areas to appear as white vertical streaks. If the neutral wiper blade fails to remove residual toner from the drum's surface, that toner may circulate on the drum a second time, causing smears on the printed page with each revolution. If the charge roller becomes damaged or does not have enough power, it may fail to adequately negatively charge the surface of the drum, allowing the drum to pick up excessive toner on the next revolution from the developer roll and causing a repeated but fainter image from the previous revolution to appear down the page. If the toner doctor blade does not ensure that a smooth, even layer of toner is applied to the developer roll, the resulting printout may have white streaks from this in places where the blade has scraped off too much toner. Alternatively, if the blade allows too much toner to remain on the developer roll, the toner particles might come loose as the roll turns, precipitate onto the paper below, and become bonded to the paper during the fusing process. This will result in a general darkening of the printed page in broad vertical stripes with very soft edges. If the fuser roller does not reach a high enough temperature or if the ambient humidity is too high, the toner will not fuse well to the paper and may flake off after printing. If the fuser is too hot, the plastic component of the toner may smear, causing the printed text to look like it is wet or smudged, or may cause the melted toner to soak through the paper to the backside. Different manufacturers claim that their toners are specifically developed for their printers and that other toner formulations may not match the original specifications in terms of either tendency to accept a negative charge, to move to the discharged areas of the photoreceptor drum from the developer roll, to fuse appropriately to the paper, or to come off the drum cleanly in each revolution. Performance As with most electronic devices, the cost of laser printers has fallen markedly over the years. In 1984, the HP LaserJet sold for $3500, had trouble with even small, low resolution graphics, and weighed . By the late 1990s, monochrome laser printers have become inexpensive enough for home office use having displaced other printing technologies, although color inkjet printers (see below) still had advantages in photo quality reproduction. , low-end monochrome laser printers can sell for less than $75, and while these printers tend to lack onboard processing and rely on the host computer to generate a raster image, they nonetheless outperform the 1984 LaserJet in nearly all situations. Laser printer speed can vary widely, and depends on many factors, including the graphic intensity of the job being processed. The fastest models can print over 200 monochrome pages per minute (12,000 pages per hour). The fastest color laser printers can print over 100 pages per minute (6000 pages per hour). Very high-speed laser printers are used for mass mailings of personalized documents, such as credit card or utility bills, and are competing with lithography in some commercial applications. The cost of this technology depends on a combination of factors, including the cost of paper, toner, drum replacement, as well as the replacement of other items such as the fuser assembly and transfer assembly. Often printers with soft plastic drums can have a very high cost of ownership that does not become apparent until the drum requires replacement. Duplex printing (printing on both sides of the paper) can halve paper costs and reduce filing volumes, albeit at a slower page-printing speed because of the longer paper path. Formerly only available on high-end printers, duplexers are now common on mid-range office printers, though not all printers can accommodate a duplexing unit. In a commercial environment such as an office, it is becoming increasingly common for businesses to use external software that increases the performance and efficiency of laser printers in the workplace. The software can be used to set rules dictating how employees interact with printers, such as setting limits on how many pages can be printed per day, limiting usage of color ink, and flagging jobs that appear to be wasteful. Color laser printers Fuji Xerox color laser printer C1110B Color laser printers use colored toner (dry ink), typically cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK). While monochrome printers only use one laser scanner assembly, color printers often have two or more. Color printing adds complexity to the printing process because very slight misalignments known as registration errors can occur between printing each color, causing unintended color fringing, blurring, or light/dark streaking along the edges of colored regions. To permit a high registration accuracy, some color laser printers use a large rotating belt called a \\"transfer belt\\". The transfer belt passes in front of all the toner cartridges and each of the toner layers are precisely applied to the belt. The combined layers are then applied to the paper in a uniform single step. Color printers usually have a higher cost per page than monochrome printers, even if printing monochrome- only pages. Liquid electrophotography (LEP) is a similar process used in HP Indigo presses that uses electrostatically charged ink instead of toner, and using a heated transfer roller instead of a fuser, that melts the charged ink particles before applying them to the paper. =Color laser transfer printers= Color laser transfer printers are designed to create transfer media which are transfer sheets designed to be applied by means of a heat press. These transfers are typically used to make custom t-shirts or custom logo products with corporate or team logos on them. 2-part Color laser transfers are part of a two-step process whereby the Color laser printers use colored toner (dry ink), typically cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK), however newer printers designed to print on dark t-shirts utilize a special white toner allowing them to make transfers for dark garments or dark business products. The CMYK color printing process allows for millions of colors to be faithfully represented by the unique imaging process. =Business model comparison with inkjet printers= Manufacturers use a similar business model for both low-cost color laser printers and inkjet printers: the printers are sold cheaply while replacement toners and inks are relatively expensive. A color laser printer's average running cost per page is usually slightly less, even though both the laser printer and laser toner cartridge have higher upfront prices, as laser toners print much more sheets relative to their cost than inkjet cartridges. Inkjet printers are better at printing photographs and color records, and keeping in mind that there are color laser printers, they're more costly. Dissimilar to inkjet printers, laser printers don't utilize ink. The print quality of color lasers is limited by their resolution (typically 600‚Äì1200 dpi) and their use of just four color toners. They often have trouble printing large areas of the same or subtle gradations of color. Inkjet printers designed for printing photos can produce much higher quality color images. An in-depth comparison of inkjet and laser printers suggest that laser printers are the ideal choice for a high quality, volume printer, while inkjet printers tend to focus on large-format printers and household units. Laser printers offer more precise edging and in-depth monochromatic color. In addition, color laser printers are much faster than inkjet printers, although being generally larger and bulkier. =Anti-counterfeiting marks= Small yellow dots on white paper, generated by a color laser printer, are nearly invisible. (Click to see higher-resolution image) Many modern color laser printers mark printouts by a nearly invisible dot raster, for the purpose of traceability. The dots are yellow and about in size, with a raster of about . This is purportedly the result of a deal between the US government and printer manufacturers to help track counterfeiters. The dots encode data such as printing date, time, and printer serial number in binary-coded decimal on every sheet of paper printed, which allows pieces of paper to be traced by the manufacturer to identify the place of purchase, and sometimes the buyer. Digital rights advocacy groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation are concerned about this erosion of the privacy and anonymity of those who print. Smart chips in toner cartridges Similar to inkjet printers, toner cartridges may contain smart chips that reduce the number of pages that can be printed with it (reducing the amount of usable ink or toner in the cartridge to sometimes only 50%RTBF documentary \\"L'obsolescence programm√©e\\" by Xavier Vanbuggenhout), in an effort to increase sales of the toner cartridges. Besides being more expensive to the consumer, this technique also increases waste, and thus increases pressure on the environment. For these toner cartridges (as with inkjet cartridges), reset devices can be used to override the limitation set by the smart chip. Also, for some printers, online walk- throughs have been posted to demonstrate how to use up all the ink in the cartridge. These chips offer no benefit to the end consumer‚Äîall laser printers originally used an optical mechanism to assess the amount of remaining toner in the cartridge rather than using a chip to electrically count the number of printed pages, and the chip's only function was as an alternate method to decrease the cartridge's usable life. Safety hazards, health risks, and precautions =Toner clean-up= Toner particles are formulated to have electrostatic properties and can develop static electric charges when they rub against other particles, objects, or the interiors of transport systems and vacuum hoses. Static discharge from charged toner particles can ignite combustible particles in a vacuum cleaner bag or create a small dust explosion if sufficient toner is airborne. Toner particles are so fine that they are poorly filtered by conventional household vacuum cleaner filter bags and blow through the motor or back into the room. If toner spills into the laser printer, a special type of vacuum cleaner with an electrically conductive hose and a high-efficiency (HEPA) filter may be needed for effective cleaning. These specialized tools are called \\"ESD-safe\\" (Electrostatic Discharge-safe) or \\"toner vacuums\\". =Ozone hazards= As a normal part of the printing process, the high voltages inside the printer can produce a corona discharge that generates a small amount of ionized oxygen and nitrogen, which react to form ozone and nitrogen oxides. In larger commercial printers and copiers, an activated carbon filter in the air exhaust stream breaks down these noxious gases to prevent pollution of the office environment. However, some ozone escapes the filtering process in commercial printers, and ozone filters are not used at all in most smaller consumer printers. When a laser printer or copier is operated for a long period of time in a small, poorly ventilated space, these gases can build up to levels at which the odor of ozone or irritation may be noticed. A potential for creating a health hazard is theoretically possible in extreme cases. =Respiratory health risks= A video on research done on printer emissions According to a 2012 study conducted in Queensland, Australia, some printers emit sub-micrometer particles which some suspect may be associated with respiratory diseases. Of 63 printers evaluated in the Queensland University of Technology study, 17 of the strongest emitters were made by HP and one by Toshiba. The machine population studied, however, was only those machines already in place in the building and was thus biased toward specific manufacturers. The authors noted that particle emissions varied substantially even among the same model of machine. According to Professor Morawska of the Queensland University of Technology, one printer emitted as many particles as a burning cigarette: In December 2011, the Australian government agency Safe Work Australia reviewed existing research and concluded that \\"no epidemiology studies directly associating laser printer emissions with adverse health outcomes were located\\" and that several assessments conclude that \\"risk of direct toxicity and health effects from exposure to laser printer emissions is negligible\\". The review also observes that, because the emissions have been shown to be volatile or semi-volatile organic compounds, \\"it would be logical to expect possible health effects to be more related to the chemical nature of the aerosol rather than the physical character of the ‚Äòparticulate‚Äô since such emissions are unlikely to be or remain as ‚Äòparticulates‚Äô after they come into contact with respiratory tissue\\". The German Social Accident Insurance has commissioned a human study project to examine the effects on health resulting from exposure to toner dusts and from photocopying and printing cycles. Volunteers (23 control persons, 15 exposed persons and 14 asthmatics) were exposed to laser printer emissions under defined conditions in an exposure chamber. The findings from the study based on a broad spectrum of processes and subjects fail to confirm that exposure to high laser printer emissions initiates a verifiable pathological process resulting in the reported illnesses. A much- discussed proposal for reducing emissions from laser printers is to retrofit them with filters. These are fixed with adhesive tape to the printer's fan vents to reduce particle emissions. However, all printers have a paper output tray being an important source of particle emissions. By their very nature, paper output trays cannot be provided with filters, so it is impossible to reduce their contribution to overall emissions with retrofit filters. =Air transport ban= After the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot, in which shipments of laser printers with explosive-filled toner cartridges were discovered on separate cargo airplanes, the US Transportation Security Administration prohibited pass-through passengers from carrying toner or ink cartridges weighing over on inbound flights, in both carry-on and checked luggage. PC Magazine noted that the ban would not impact most travelers, as the majority of cartridges do not exceed the prescribed weight.

Career Matthias Jakob Schleiden was born in Hamburg, a city of the Holy Roman Empire, on 5 April 1804. His father was the municipal physician of Hamburg. Schleiden pursued legal studies graduating in 1827. He then established a legal practice but after a period of emotional depression and an attempted suicide, he changed professions. He studied natural science at the University of G√∂ttingen in G√∂ttingen, Germany, but transferred to the University of Berlin in 1835 to study plants. Johann Horkel, Schleiden's uncle, encouraged him to study plant embryology. He soon developed his love for botany into a full-time pursuit. Schleiden preferred to study plant structure under the microscope. As a professor of botany at the University of Jena, he wrote Contributions to our Knowledge of Phytogenesis (1838), in which he stated that all plants are composed of cells. Thus, Schleiden and Schwann became the first to formulate what was then an informal belief as a principle of biology equal in importance to the atomic theory of chemistry. He also recognized the importance of the cell nucleus, discovered in 1831 by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown, and sensed its connection with cell division. He became professor of botany at the University of Dorpat in 1863. He concluded that all plant parts are made of cells and that an embryonic plant organism arises from the one cell.

Dot matrix printers typically use a print head that moves back and forth or in an up-and-down motion on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter or line printer. However, a dot matrix printer is able to print arbitrary patterns and not just specific characters. The perceived quality of dot matrix printers depends on the vertical and horizontal resolution and the ability of the printer to overlap adjacent dots. 9-pin and 24-pin are common; this specifies the number of pins in a specific vertically aligned space. With 24-pin printers, the horizontal movement can slightly overlap dots, producing visually superior output (near letter quality or NLQ), usually at the cost of speed. Dot matrix printing is typically distinguished from non-impact methods, such as inkjet, thermal, or laser printing, though they too may use a bitmap to represent the printed work.  History  In 1925, Rudolf Hell invented the Hellschreiber, an early facsimile-like dot matrix-based teletypewriter device, patented in 1929. Between 1952 and 1954 Fritz Karl Preikschat filed five patent applications for his teletype writer 7 stylus 35 dot matrix aka PKT printer, a dot matrix teletypewriter built between 1954 and 1956 in Germany. Like the earlier Hellschreiber, it still used electromechanical means of coding and decoding, but it used a start-stop method (asynchronous transmission) rather than synchronous transmission for communication. In 1956, while he was employed at Telefonbau und Normalzeit GmbH (TuN, later called Tenovis), the device was introduced to the Deutsche Bundespost (German Post Office), which did not show interest. When Preikschat emigrated into the US in 1957 he sold the rights to utilize the applications in any countries (except for the USA) to TuN. The prototype was also shown to General Mills in 1957. An improved transistorized design became the basis for a portable dot matrix facsimile machine, which was prototyped and evaluated for military use by Boeing around 1966‚Äì1967. An Epson MX-80, a classic model that remained in use for many years IBM marketed its first dot matrix printer in 1957, the same year that the dye-sublimation printer entered the market. In 1968, the Japanese manufacturer OKI introduced its first serial impact dot matrix printer (SIDM), the OKI Wiredot. The printer supported a character generator for 128 characters with a print matrix of 7√ó5. It was aimed at governmental, financial, scientific and educational markets. For this achievement, OKI received an award from the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ) in 2013. In 1970 Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) introduced an impact dot matrix printer, the LA30, as did Centronics (then of Hudson, New Hampshire): the Centronics 101. The search for a reliable printer mechanism led it to develop a relationship with Brother Industries, Ltd of Japan, and the sale of Centronics-badged Brother printer mechanisms equipped with a Centronics print head and Centronics electronics. Unlike Digital, Centronics concentrated on the low-end line printer marketplace with their distinctive units. In the process, they designed the parallel electrical interface that was to become standard on most printers until it began to be replaced by the Universal Serial Bus (USB) in the late 1990s. The Apple ImageWriter was a popular consumer dot matrix printer in the 1980s until the mid 1990s. In the 1970s and 1980s, dot matrix printers were generally considered the best combination of expense and versatility, and until the 1990s they were by far the most common form of printer used with personal and home computers.  Design  Typical output from a dot matrix printer operating in draft mode. This entire image represents an area of printer output approximately in size Epson VP-500 Printer with its cover removed Dot matrix printing uses a print head that moves back-and-forth, or in an up-and-down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink- soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. Each dot is produced by a tiny metal rod, also called a \\"wire\\" or \\"pin\\", which is driven forward by the power of a tiny electromagnet or solenoid, either directly or through small levers (pawls). Facing the ribbon and the paper is a small guide plate named ribbon mask holder or protector, sometimes also called butterfly for its typical shape. It is pierced with holes to serve as guides for the pins. The plate may be made of hard plastic or an artificial jewel such as sapphire or ruby. The portion of the printer that contains the pin is called the print head. When running the printer, it generally prints one line of text at a time. The printer head is attached to a metal bar that ensures correct alignment, but horizontal positioning is controlled by a band that attaches to sprockets on two wheels at each side which is then driven with an electric motor. This band may be made of stainless steel, phosphor bronze or beryllium copper alloys, nylon or various synthetic materials with a twisted nylon core to prevent stretching. Actual position can be found out either by dead count using a stepper motor, rotary encoder attached to one wheel or a transparent plastic band with markings that is read by an optical sensor on the printer head (common on inkjets). Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, dot matrix printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies. Although nearly all inkjet, thermal, and laser printers also print closely spaced dots rather than continuous lines or characters, it is not customary to call them dot matrix printers. Dot matrix printers have one of the lowest printing costs per page. They are able to use fanfold continuous paper with tractor holes. Dot matrix printers create noise when the pins or typeface strike the ribbon to the paper, and sound-damping enclosures may have to be used in quiet environments. They can only print lower-resolution graphics, with limited color performance, limited quality, and lower speeds compared to non-impact printers.  Variations  An example of a wide-carriage printer, designed for paper 14 inches wide, shown with legal paper loaded (8.5\\"√ó14\\") Print head of a used 9-pin printer (Star NL10) The common serial dot matrix printers use a horizontally moving print head. The print head can be thought of featuring a single vertical column of seven or more pins approximately the height of a character box. In reality, the pins are arranged in up to four vertically or/and horizontally slightly displaced columns in order to increase the dot density and print speed through interleaving without causing the pins to jam. Thereby, up to 48 pins can be used to form the characters of a line while the print head moves horizontally. The printing speed of serial dot matrix printers with moving heads varies from 30DEC LA30 to 1550 cps.Epson DFX-9000 https://www.epson.de/products/printers/dot-matrix-printers/epson- dfx-9000#specifications In a considerably different configuration, so called line dot matrix printers use a fixed print head almost as wide as the paper path utilizing a horizontal line of thousands of pins for printing. Sometimes two horizontally slightly displaced rows are used to improve the effective dot density through interleaving. While still line-oriented, these printers for the professional heavy-duty market effectively print a whole line at once while the paper moves forward below the print head. Line matrix printers are capable of printing much more than 1000 cps, resulting in a throughput of up to 800 pages/hour. A variation on the dot matrix printer was the cross hammer dot printer, patented by Seikosha in 1982.Patent US4462705 Cross hammer dot printer, Google Patents, accessed 2013-10-01 The smooth cylindrical roller of a conventional printer was replaced by a spinning, fluted cylinder. The print head was a simple hammer, with a vertical projecting edge, operated by an electromagnet. Where the vertical edge of the hammer intersected the horizontal flute of the cylinder, compressing the paper and ribbon between them, a single dot was marked on the paper. Characters were built up of multiple dots.

By definition, a funicular uses two counterbalanced passenger cars attached to opposite ends of the same cable, which is looped over a pulley at the upper end of a track. A funicular's two cars move in concert: as one ascends, the other descends simultaneously, an arrangement that distinguishes a funicular from other cable-guided transportation systems‚Äîe.g., a single-car inclined elevator. The term funicular derives from the Latin word , the diminutive of , meaning 'rope'.  Operation  Engine-room of a funicular In a funicular both cars (or trains) are permanently connected to the opposite ends of the same cable, known as a haul rope. At the engine room at upper end of the track the haul rope runs through a system of pulleys. Sheaves- unpowered pulleys allowing the cable to change direction- guide the cable along the track and to and from the drive pulley. The rope pulls one car upwards while the other car descends the slope at the other end of the rope. Except for the weight of passengers, the weight of the two cars is counterbalanced, so the engine only has to lift the excess passengers and supply the energy lost to friction. Typically in a modern funicular the propulsion is provided by an electric motor which is linked via a speed- reducing gearbox to a large pulley ‚Äì a drive bullwheel. The bullwheel in its turn transfers its torque to the haul rope by friction. The bullwheel has two grooves: after the first half turn around it the cable returns back via an auxiliary pulley. This arrangement has the advantage of having twice the contact area between the cable and the groove, and returning the downward- moving cable in the same plane as the upward-moving one. Modern installations also use high friction liners to enhance the friction between the bullwheel grooves and the cable. For emergency and service purposes two sets of brakes are used at the engine room: the emergency brake grips directly the bullwheel, the service brake is mounted at the high speed shaft of the gear. In a case of emergency the cars are also equipped with spring-applied, hydraulically opened rail brakes. = Track layout = Track layouts used in funiculars Funicular wheelset with Abt rack and pinion brake Early funiculars used two parallel straight tracks, four rails, with separate station platforms at both ends for each vehicle. The tracks are laid with sufficient space between them for the two cars to pass at the midpoint. In any funicular design, the cars always pass at the same location every trip. A three-rail arrangement also has two platforms at each end, but allows lower track cost while allowing the cars to pass at the half-way point. Examples of this type of track layout are the Duquesne Incline in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and most cliff railways in the UK. In layouts using three rails, the middle rail is shared by both cars, like in the early version of the Pet≈ô√≠n funicular in Prague. A two-rail layout is the narrowest of all and needs only a single platform at each end, but the required passing section is more complex and costly to build. If a rack for braking is used, that rack can be mounted higher in a three-rail layout, making it less sensitive to choking in snowy conditions. Some four-rail funiculars have the upper and lower sections interlaced, with a single platform at each station. The Hill Train at Legoland, Windsor, is an example of this configuration. The track layout can also be changed during the renovation of a funicular, and often four-rail layouts have been rebuilt as two- or three-rail layouts; e.g., the Wellington Cable Car in New Zealand was rebuilt with two rails. =Abt automatic turnout= Wheelset of a two-rail funicular The Swiss engineer Carl Roman Abt invented the method that allows cars to be used with a two-rail configuration. The cars, in this case, have their wheelsets of a rather unconventional design: the outboard wheel has flanges on both sides whereas the inboard wheel is unflanged. One car has its dual-flanged wheels on the left side, so it follows the leftmost rail; the other car has it on the right side, and it follows the rightmost rail. Thus the left car always goes through the left branch of the passing loop and the right car through its right branch. The car's unflanged wheels are considerably wider than their opposites, allowing them to roll over the turnouts easily from one rail to another and above the cables. This system has no moving parts for switches and crossings, and compared with the other options it has proven to be quite reliable and cost-effective. It was first implemented by Abt in 1886 on the Lugano Citt√†‚ÄìStazione funicular (Switzerland). Since then the two-rail system with the Abt turnout have increased in popularity, so as to become a standard for modern funiculars. = Water counterbalancing = Fribourg funicular featuring the Abt switch runs on waste water A few funiculars have been built using water tanks under the floor of each car that are filled or emptied until just sufficient imbalance is achieved to allow movement. The car at the top of the hill is loaded with water until it is heavier than the car at the bottom, causing it to descend the hill and pull up the other car. The water is drained at the bottom, and the process repeats with the cars exchanging roles. The movement is controlled by a brakeman using the brake handle of the rack and pinion system engaged with the rack mounted between the rails. The Bom Jesus funicular built in 1882 near Braga, Portugal is one of the extant systems of this type. Another example, the in Fribourg, Switzerland, is of particular interest as it utilizes waste water, coming from a sewage plant at the upper part of the city. Some funiculars of this type were later converted to electrical power. For example, the Giessbachbahn in the Swiss canton of Berne, opened in 1879, was originally powered by water ballast. In 1912 its energy provision was replaced by a hydraulic engine powered by a Pelton turbine. In 1948 this in turn was replaced by an electric motor. = Bottom towrope = Bottom towrope The cars can be attached to a second cable running through a pulley at the bottom of the incline in case the gravity force acting on the vehicles is too low to operate them on the slope. One of the pulleys must be designed as a tensioning wheel to avoid slack in the ropes. In this case, the winching can also be done at the lower end of the incline. This practice is used for funiculars with slopes below 6%, funiculars using sledges instead of cars, or any other case where it is not ensured that the descending car is always able to pull out the cable from the pulley in the station on the top of the incline.Walter Hefti: Schienenseilbahnen in aller Welt. Schiefe Seilebenen, Standseilbahnen, Kabelbahnen. Birkh√§user, Basel 1975, (German) Another reason for a bottom cable is that the cable supporting the lower car at the extent of its travel will potentially weigh several tons, whereas that supporting the upper car weighs virtually nothing. The lower cable adds an equal amount of cable weight to the upper car while deducting the same weight from the lower, thereby keeping the cars in equilibrium.  History  T√ºnel in Istanbul, launched in 1875, Karak√∂y station as of 2006 A number of cable railway systems which pull their cars on inclined slopes were built since the 1820s. In the second half of the 19th century the design of a funicular as a transit system emerged. It was especially attractive in comparison with the other systems of the time as counterbalancing of the cars was deemed to be a cost-cutting solution. The first line of the Funiculars of Lyon () opened in 1862, followed by other lines in 1878, 1891 and 1900. The Budapest Castle Hill Funicular was built in 1868‚Äì69, with the first test run on 23 October 1869. The oldest funicular railway operating in Britain dates from 1875 and is in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. In Istanbul, Turkey, the T√ºnel has been in continuous operation since 1875 and is both the first underground funicular and the second-oldest underground railway. It remained powered by a steam engine up until it was taken for renovation in 1968. Until the end of the 1870s, the four-rail parallel-track funicular was the normal configuration. Carl Roman Abt developed the Abt Switch allowing the two-rail layout, which was used for the first time in 1879 when the Giessbach Funicular opened in Switzerland. In the United States, the first funicular to use a two-rail layout was the Telegraph Hill Railroad in San Francisco, which was in operation from 1884 until 1886. The Mount Lowe Railway in Altadena, California, was the first mountain railway in the United States to use the three-rail layout. Three- and two-rail layouts considerably reduced the space required for building a funicular, reducing grading costs on mountain slopes and property costs for urban funiculars. These layouts enabled a funicular boom in the latter half of the 19th century. In 1880 the funicular of Mount Vesuvius inspired the Italian popular song Funicul√¨, Funicul√†. This funicular was destroyed repeatedly by volcanic eruptions and abandoned after the eruption of 1944.  Inclined elevator  Odessa Funicular in Ukraine is not a funicular proper An inclined elevator is not a funicular, since its cars operate independently on the slope, not in interconnected pairs. Notably, Paris' Montmartre Funicular is today a funicular in name only. Its formal title is a relic of its earlier configuration, namely when its two cars originally operated in a counterbalanced, interconnected pair, always moving in opposite directions in concert, thus meeting the definition of a funicular. The system now uses two independently operating cars that can each ascend or descend on demand, qualifying as a double inclined elevator, but retaining the term \\"funicular\\" in its title as a historical, albeit misleading, reference.  Exceptional examples  According to the Guinness World Records, the smallest public funicular in the world is the Fisherman's Walk Cliff Railway in Bournemouth, England, which is long. Stoosbahn in Switzerland, with a maximum slope of 110% (47.7¬∞), is the steepest funicular in the world. The city of Valparaiso in Chile used to have up to 30 funicular elevators (). The oldest of them is dating from 1883. 15 remain with almost half in operation, and others in various stages of restoration. The Carmelit in Haifa, Israel, with six stations and a tunnel 1.8 km (1.1 mi) long, is claimed by the Guinness World Records as the \\"least extensive metro\\" in the world. Technically, it is an underground funicular. The Dresden Suspension Railway (), which hangs from an elevated rail, is the only suspended funicular in the world.

Basically, it prints a page-wide line of dots. It builds up a line of text by printing lines of dots. Applications Line matrix printers are used for high-speed printing applications in industries such as manufacturing, banking, supply chain and back office environments. In these high-volume printing industries, line matrix printers are used to produce invoices, bank statements, product shipment and transportation documentation as well as product compliance labels. Line matrix printers can print text, bar codes and graphics. Line matrix printers were originally popularized by the mini-computer craze and continued its growth as a bar code printer. Today they are sold in virtually every corner of the world and while they print as rapidly as line printers, they can print bar codes and other graphics as well. When implemented as impact printers, they can be the least expensive to operate per page. How It Works Often considered the \\"backbone\\" of many industrial and back-office systems, there are several types of line matrix printers used today across diverse enterprise production environments including: manufacturing, supply chain, distribution & logistics, transportation, finance and banking. Dot matrix printers, also known also as impact printers, represent the oldest printing technology, are still widely used today, due to its lowest 'cost per page' ratio. Dot matrix printers are divided on two main groups: serial dot matrix printers and line matrix printers. Line matrix mechanism A serial dot matrix printer is a type of computer printer with a print head that runs back and forth, or in an up and down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies. Both line matrix and serial dot matrix printers, use pins to strike against the inked ribbon, making dots on the paper and forming the desired characters. The differences are that line matrix printers use a hammer bank (or print- shuttle) instead of print head, this print-shuttle has hammers instead of print wires, and these hammers are arranged in a horizontal row instead in vertical column. The hammer bank uses the same technology as the permanent magnet print head with the small difference that instead of print wires the print-shuttle has hammers. The permanent magnetic field holds the hammer spring in stressed, ready to strike position. The driver sends electric current to hammer coil, which then creates electromagnetic field opposite to the permanent magnetic field. When both fields equalize, the energy stored in the spring is released to strike the hammer against the ribbon and prints a dot on the paper. During the printing process the print-shuttle vibrates in horizontal direction with high speed while the print hammers are fired selectively. Each hammer prints a series of dots in horizontal direction for one pass of the shuttle, then paper advances at one step and the shuttle prints the following row of dots Line Matrix Printers versus Laser Printers For years laser printers have been the popular choice, however line matrix printers have improved technological aspects and now claim to hold significant benefits over laser printers in terms of energy savings, cost per page, reliability in industrial environments and media flexibility (multi part forms, oversize media, peel off labels, cloth, or card stock). Every aspect of the line matrix printer is designed to deliver higher reliability, fast throughput, and greater resistance to rough handling and hazardous environmental conditions. The result is a product that provides a substantially lower cost over the life of the product. Industry today continues to use line matrix in the print production of mission critical business document production. These documents are critical to keeping the enterprise operation functioning. If these documents don't print the business workflow stops. Emerging Technology Line matrix technology continues to advance based on the need to support modern IT environments. Examples of emerging technologies include: * Developing longer lasting ink cartridges. * Integrating a \\"Plug and Print\\" solution. * Adding new language support, expanded bar code symbologies and system interface enhancements * Adding remote printing management systems.

Page printers are often all incorrectly termed ‚Äúlaser printers‚Äùalthough virtually all laser printers are page printers, other page printing technologies also exist Components The components of a page printer are: *A print engine, \\"the unit within a printer that does the actual printing.\\" For example, in a laser printer this would consist of the laser and drum and the mechanical paper feeds. * Memory to process input and build up the image of a page. The printer may have its own memory or may use the host computer's memory. * A page description language (PDL), with commands which tell the printer how to format the page. Popular PDLs are PCL (Printer Command Language) from Hewlett-Packard, PostScript from Adobe Systems and PostScript clones, and Windows‚Äô Graphics Device Interface (GDI). *A raster image processor (RIP), i.e. a processor which constructs the bitmap image of the page. Sometimes, this processing is done by the host computer. In other cases printers may have powerful processors to perform this task. *A printer driver, a program (device driver) which converts the computer's information about the page into the actual PDL. Printer drivers may be included with the operating system, be distributed with the printer on CDs or DVDs, or be downloaded from the printer manufacturer's home page or from independent web sites. *A connection (interface) to the host computer. Many printers communicate by Wi-Fi. Other popular interfaces are USB and Ethernet. Many older printers also have a parallel (Centronics) interface. High-end printers often have a channel interface for direct connection to a mainframe computer. Page printing technologies There are several page printing technologies, for example: *Laser printers, in which a laser beam draws the page image on charged drum which collects charged toner and transfers the image to paper. *LED printers, which use Light-emitting diodes instead of a laser beam, but are otherwise very similar to laser printers. *Melted wax (‚Äúphaser‚Äù) printers, where solid ink is heated to the melting point and is applied on the print medium where it immediately solidifies. *Dye-sublimation printers, where a solid ink (dye) is converted to a gaseous state (sublimation) and applied on the print medium, where it immediately solidifies. Properties *Resolution, 600 or 1200 dpi (dots per inch) is common in most modern page printers, often with resolution enhancement or anti-aliasing to smooth uneven lines. Higher resolutions are common. Before about 1992, the year Hewlett-Packard made the LaserJet 4, built around a Canon engine, most page printers had only 300 dpi, which made visible jagged lines and relatively poor image quality. *Engine speed. In 1984 Canon introduced the first ‚Äúsmall‚Äù laser printers which could sit on a (sturdy) desktop with a print speed of 8 pages per minute (ppm). Today, even the smallest page printers may be able to print 15‚Äì20 ppm, and the largest may print above 1000 ppm. *Processing power. Usually larger printers have more powerful processors than small personal ones. *Size, from personal page printers at to high-volume production printers which may not be installed by one person. *Cost, both cost of the printer and the operating costs. Generally, the larger and more expensive printers have lower operating costs than the small and inexpensive ones. *Paper-handling facilities for folding, stapling, etc., especially for the larger printers. *Colour printing capability. Many printers print in black only. Colour printers usually have multiple toner cartridges, wax patrons etc. Printers using CMYK colour have four, one each for the colours cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. RGB printers have three, red, green, and blue, but may also have a \\"true black\\". Some ink jet printers may have additional cartridges, for example light cyan and light magenta in addition to the others, but this is rarely found in page printers. *Multi-function devices provide additional functions such as copying, scanning, or FAX. *Media handling: Most page printers accept paper, transparencies, envelopes, labels etc. in formats up to A4 and letter. Some printers may also handle other media types such as larger formats and heavier paper. *Energy consumption, noise, etc. Some page printers are too noisy to stay in the near vicinity of the users, even if page printers are quieter than the old line printers and other impact printers.

In recent times the use of human-powered rickshaws has been discouraged or outlawed in many countries due to concern for the welfare of rickshaw workers. Pulled rickshaws have been replaced mainly by cycle rickshaw and auto rickshaws. Overview Rickshaws are commonly believed to have been invented in Japan in the 1860s, at the beginning of a rapid period of technical advancement. In the 19th century, rickshaw pulling became an inexpensive, popular mode of transportation across Asia. Peasants who migrated to large Asian cities often worked first as a rickshaw runner. It was \\"the deadliest occupation in the East, [and] the most degrading for human beings to pursue.\\" The rickshaw's popularity in Japan declined by the 1930s with the advent of automated forms of transportation, like automobiles and trains. In China, the rickshaw's popularity began to decline in the 1920s. In Singapore, the rickshaw's popularity increased into the 20th century. There were approximately 50,000 rickshaws in 1920 and that number doubled by 1930. Description The initial rickshaws rode on iron-shod wooden wheels and the passenger sat on hard, flat seats. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, rubber or pneumatic rubber tires, spring cushions, and backrests improved the passenger's comfort. Other features, such as lights, were also added. In the city of Shanghai, public rickshaws were painted yellow to differentiate from the private vehicles of the wealthy citizens, which were described as: > ... always shiny, were carefully maintained, and sported 'a spotless white > upholstered double seat, a clean plaid for one's lap, and a wide protective > tarpaulin to protect the passenger (or passengers, since sometimes up to > three people rode together) against the rain.' The rickshaws were a convenient means of travel, able to traverse winding, narrow city streets. During monsoon season, passengers might be carried out of the carriage, above the flooded streets, to the door of their arrival. They offered door-to-door travel, unlike scheduled public bus and tram service. Country overview =Africa= East Africa In the 1920s, it was used in Bagamoyo, Tanga, Tanzania and other areas of East Africa for short distances. Madagascar Pousse-pousse in Madagascar Rickshaws, known as pousse-pousse, were introduced by British missionaries. The intention was to eliminate the slavery-associated palanquin. Its name pousse-pousse, meaning push-push, is reportedly gained from the need to have a second person to push the back of the rickshaw on Madagascar's hilly roads. They are a common form of transport in a number of Malagasy cities, especially Antsirabe, but are not found in the towns or cities with very hilly roads. They are similar to Chinese rickshaws and are often brightly decorated. Nairobi Rickshaws operated in Nairobi in the beginning of the 20th century; pullers went on strike there in 1908. South Africa Durban is famous for its iconic Zulu rickshaw pullers navigating throughout the city. These colorful characters are famous for their giant, vibrant hats and costumes. There were about 2,000 registered men who pulled rickshaws in Durban in 1904; Since displaced by motorised transport, there are approximately 25 rickshaws left who mostly cater to tourists today. =Asia= Confucius (transported in a wheeled cart) and children, as imagined by a 17th-century Chinese artist; presumably, the design is similar to the vehicles used at the time. (Illustration from a children's book, Xiao er lun, printed in 1680) China In China, from the ancient times and until the 19th century, rich and important people, when traveling overland, were commonly transported in sedan chairs carried by bearers, rather than in wheeled vehicles. This was at least partly explained by road conditions. It is thought that it was from China (or East Asia in general) that sedan chair (a.k.a. \\"palanquin\\") designs were introduced into Western Europe in the 17th century. However, wheeled carts for one or two passengers, pushed (rather than pulled, like a proper rikshaw) by human servant, were attested as well. Rickshaw and driver in Qingdao, c. 1914 In the 19th century, wheelbarrow is the most popular transportation for commoners. In the spring of 1873, the French merchant Menard introduced rickshaw from Japan. The original name is \\"Jinrikisha\\", meaning \\"man-power-vehicle\\" in Japanese. Most of the rickshaws were owned by foreign investors at the beginning, but in around the 1900s, rickshaws were owned mostly by Chinese companies. The official name for rickshaw is \\"renliche\\", meaning \\"man-power-vehicle\\" in Chinese, but it is more commonly called \\"dongyangche\\", meaning \\"east-foreign-vehicle\\", or \\"huangbaoche\\" in Shanghai, meaning \\"yellow carriage for rent.\\" Rickshaw transportation was an important element in urban development in 20th century China, as a mode of transportation, source of employment and facilitation of migration for workers. According to author David Strand: > Sixty thousand men took as many as a half million fares a day in a city of > slightly more than one million. Sociologist Li Jinghan estimated that one > out of six males in the city between the ages of sixteen and fifty was a > puller. Rickshaw men and their dependents made up almost 20 percent of > Beijing's population. Most manual rickshaws ‚Äì seen by many Maoists as a symbol of oppression of the working class ‚Äì were eliminated in China after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. =Shanghai= Shanghai's rickshaw industry began in 1874 with 1,000 rickshaws imported from Japan. By 1914 there were 9,718 vehicles. The pullers were a large group of the city's working poor: 100,000 men pulled rickshaws by the early 1940s, up from 62,000 in the mid-1920s. In contrary to coolies in Beijing, those in Shanghai mostly come from rural areas out of the city. With the destitution of their land, they poured into the city with their family. As the number of coolies rose up sharply, however, the number of rickshaw remained at 20,000 in Shanghai. Except private coolies, those for public work had to take turns, and thus their average income diminished to $9 per month. Therefore, many coolies worked in the factory and ran the rickshaw after work. However, many coolies were optimistic about life. They were satisfied about their income and dreamed of purchasing their own rickshaws and sending their kids to schools. Due to this low income, many coolies would not give customers a clear idea of standard price and thus charge higher at any chance they had. In response to this phenomenon, hotels would provide the distance to various streets and the price charged.Darwent, Charles Ewart.

Hong Kong The Peak, Hong Kong, can find this last licensed rickshaw ride in this ex-British colony. Rickshaws were first imported to Hong Kong from Japan in 1880. They were a popular form of transport for many years, peaking at more than 3,000 in the 1920s. However, their popularity waned after World War II. No new licenses for rickshaws have been issued since 1975, and only a few old men‚Äîthree as of 2017 Vehicle Licensing during - 2008-2017‚Äîstill hold a license. It is reported that only one of them still offer rickshaw rides on The Peak, mainly for tourists.Ë¢´ÈÅ∫ÂøòÁöÑÂÖ¨‰∫§ The Forgotten Transportation: Rickshaw ride in Hong Kong India Kolkata rickshaw, 2004 Around 1880, rickshaws appeared in India, first in Simla. At the turn of the century it was introduced in Kolkata (Calcutta), India and in 1914 was a conveyance for hire. =Service availability= Though most cities offer auto rickshaw service, hand-pulled rickshaws do exist in some areas, such as Kolkata, \\"the last bastion of human powered tana rickshaws\\". According to Trillin, most Kolkata rickshaws serve people \\"just a notch above poor\\" who tend to travel short distances. However, in a recent article by Hyrapiet and Greiner, the authors found that rickshaws also transport middle-class residents who use their services out of convenience and for short distance trips to the local marketplace. Rickshaws are used to transport goods, shoppers, and school children. It is also used as a \\"24-hour ambulance service.\\" Also according to Hyrapiet and Greiner, rickshaw pullers have acted as peer-educators for the Calcutta Samaritans providing critical information on HIV/AIDS because of their access to marginalized groups within Kolkata's red light districts. Rickshaws are the most effective means of transportation through the flooded streets of the monsoon season. When Kolkata floods rickshaw business increases and prices rise. The pullers live a life of poverty and many sleep under rickshaws. Rudrangshu Mukerjee, an academic, stated many people's ambivalent feelings about riding a rickshaw: he does not like being carried about in a rickshaw but does not like the idea of \\"taking away their livelihood.\\" Motor vehicles are banned in the Eco-sensitive zone area of Matheran, India, a tourist hill station near Mumbai so man-pulled rickshaws are still one of the major forms of transport there. =Legislation= In August 2005, the Communist government of West Bengal announced plans to completely ban pulled rickshaws, resulting in protests and strikes of the pullers.WebIndia, 2005. In 2006, the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, announced that pulled rickshaws would be banned and that rickshaw pullers would be rehabilitated. A Chinese man posing next to his rickshaw, Medan, Indonesia 1936 Indonesia Pulled rickshaws used to be in Indonesia a long time ago. Nowadays, they are replaced by Delman (the horse-drawn carriage) and Becak (Cycle rickshaw/pedicab). Edward, Prince of Wales disguising himself as Jinrikishafu (Japanese ricksha men) at a party in 1922. Japan There are several theories about the invention of the rickshaw. Japan historian Seidensticker wrote of the theories: > Though the origins of the rickshaw are not entirely clear, they seem to be > Japanese, and of Tokyo specifically. The most widely accepted theory offers > the name of three inventors, and gives 1869 as the date of invention. Starting in 1870, the Tokyo government issued a permission for Izumi Yosuke, Takayama Kosuke, and Suzuki Tokujiro to build and sell rickshaws. By 1872, they became the main mode of transportation in Japan, with about 40,000 rickshaws in service. The rickshaw's popularity in Japan declined by the 1930s with the advent of automated forms of transportation, like automobiles and trains. After World War II, when gasoline and automobiles were scarce, they made a temporary come-back. The rickshaw tradition has stayed alive in Kyoto and Tokyo's geisha districts only for tourists as well as in other tourist places. The tradition completely disappeared once, but a few people revived jinrikisha (human-powered rickshaws) for tourists in the 1970s-1980sJinrikisha in Kamakura Youfuu-teiJinrikisha in Hidatakayama Gokurak-sha and the rickshaws became popular as a tourism resource in the 2000s.3-Day Model Trip Day1 / Kakunodate - Lake Tazawa-ko - Morioka Japan National Tourism Organization, 31 January 2002‰∫¨ÈÉΩË¶≥ÂÖâ Ôº©Ôº≥Ôº¶Ôº™ÊîøÁ≠ñ„Éï„Ç©„Éº„É©„É†ÔºíÔºêÔºêÔºôÁô∫Ë°®Ë´ñÊñá 12 ‚Äì 13 December 2009Rickshaw TV Show \\"Sekai Tsukai Densetsu\\" 2002-2003 The modern rickshaw men are a kind of tourist guide, who take their clients to some tourist spots and explain about them.Hataraku Ikemen JoshiFuji Channel 2013/04/29 Many of them are part-time working students and athletes who like running or exchanging cultures. Malaysia Rickshaws were a common mode of transport in urban areas of Malaysia in the 19th and early 20th centuries until gradually replaced by cycle rickshaws. Pakistan Pulled and Cycle rickshaw (qinqi) have been banned in Pakistan since November 1949. Prior to the introduction of auto rickshaws in cities, horse-drawn carriages (tongas) were a main source of public transportation. Philippines The pulled rickshaw never gained acceptance in the Philippines. Americans tried to introduce it to Manila in the early 20th century, but it was strongly opposed by local Filipinos who viewed it as an undignified mode of transport that turned humans into \\"beasts\\". The main mode of public and private transportation in the Philippines from the 18th to the early 20th centuries was the kalesa, a two- wheeled horse-drawn carriage. Singapore Singapore had received its first rickshaws in 1880 and soon after they were prolific, making a \\"noticeable change in the traffic on Singapore's streets.\\" Bullock carts and gharries were used prior to the introduction of rickshaws. Many of the poorest individuals in Singapore in the late nineteenth century were poor, unskilled people of Chinese ancestry. Sometimes called coolies, the hardworking men found pulling rickshaws was a new means of employment. Rickshaw pullers experienced \\"very poor\\" living conditions, poverty and long hours of hard work. Income remained unchanged from 1876 to 1926, about $.60 per day.Suryadinata (1992). p. 39. Rickshaws popularity increased into the 20th century. There were approximately 50,000 rickshaws in 1920 and that number doubled by 1930. In or after the 1920s a union was formed, called the Rickshaw Association, protect the welfare of rickshaw workers.Suryadinata (1992). p. 45. =North America= United States of America A tourist \\"Ricsha\\" ride in Chinatown, Los Angeles, 1938 From A History of the Los Angeles City Market (1930-1950), pulled rickshaws were operated in Los Angeles by high school teenagers during that time period. Canada Foot-driven rickshaws have enjoyed several decades of popularity in Halifax, Nova Scotia; in addition to providing tours of the historic Waterfront, rickshaws are also occasionally used for transportation by local residents. The city is home to the oldest rickshaw company in Canada. Rickshaws are a popular mode of transportation in downtown Ottawa, Ontario, providing tours of historical Byward Market, in the summer. Ottawa's rickshaws stay true to the traditional foot-driven rickshaw model, but feature modern sound-systems.

Bentley worked as a journalist on several newspapers, including the Daily Telegraph. He also worked for the imperialist weekly called The Outlook during the editorship of James Louis Garvin. His first published collection of poetry, titled Biography for Beginners (1905), popularized the clerihew form; it was followed by two other collections, More Biography (1929) and Baseless Biography (1939). His detective novel Trent's Last Case (1913)Trent's Last Case, was much praised, numbering Dorothy L.

Inkjet printers are the most commonly used type of printer, and range from small inexpensive consumer models to expensive professional machines. The concept of inkjet printing originated in the 20th century, and the technology was first extensively developed in the early 1950s. The world first inkjet printer was invented by Ichiro Endo, who worked for Canon in Japan. In the late 1970s, inkjet printers that could reproduce digital images generated by computers were developed, mainly by Epson, Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Canon. In the worldwide consumer market, four manufacturers account for the majority of inkjet printer sales: Canon, HP, Epson and Brother. In 1982, Robert Howard came up with the idea to produce a small color printing system that used piezo's to spit drops of ink. He formed the company, R.H research (later named Howtek, Inc.), and developed the revolutionary technology that lead to the Pixelmaster color printer using Solid ink. The emerging ink jet material deposition market also uses inkjet technologies, typically printheads using piezoelectric crystals, to deposit materials directly on substrates. The technology has been extended and the 'ink' can now also comprise solder paste in PCB assembly, or living cells, for creating biosensors and for tissue engineering.Reactive Inkjet Printing, Editors: Patrick J Smith, Aoife Morrin, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2018, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-78801-051-1 Images produced on inkjet printers are sometimes sold under trade names such as Digigraph, Iris prints, Gicl√©e, and Cromalin. Inkjet-printed fine art reproductions are commonly sold under such trade names to imply a higher quality product and avoid association with everyday printing.  Methods  Fluid surface tension naturally pulls a stream into droplets. Optimal drop sizes of 0.004 inch require a inkjet nozzle size of about 0.003 inches. Fluids with surface tension may be water based, wax or oil based and even melted metal alloys. Most drops can be electrically charged. There are two main technologies in use in contemporary inkjet printers: continuous (CIJ) and drop-on-demand (DOD). Continuous inkjet means the flow pressurized and in a continuous stream. Drop- On-Demand means the fluid is expelled from the jet nozzle one drop at a time. This can be done with a mechanical means with a push or some electrical method. A large electrical charge can pull drops out of a nozzle, sound waves can push fluid from a nozzle or a chamber volume expansion can expel a drop. Continuous streaming was investigated first many years ago. Drop-On-Demand was only discovered in the 1920's. = Continuous inkjet = Schematic diagram of a continuous inkjet printing process The continuous inkjet (CIJ) method is used commercially for marking and coding of products and packages. In 1867, Lord Kelvin patented the syphon recorder, which recorded telegraph signals as a continuous trace on paper using an ink jet nozzle deflected by a magnetic coil. The first commercial devices (medical strip chart recorders) were introduced in 1951 by Siemens. using the patent US2566443 invented by Elmquist Rune dated 9/4/1951. In CIJ technology, a high-pressure pump directs liquid ink from a reservoir through a gunbody and a microscopic nozzle (usually .003 inch diameter), creating a continuous stream of ink droplets via the Plateau- Rayleigh instability. A piezoelectric crystal may be used to create an acoustic wave as it vibrates within the gunbody and causes the stream of liquid to break into droplets at regular intervals: 64,000 to 165,000 droplets per second may be achieved. The ink droplets are subjected to an electrostatic field created by a charging electrode or by a magnetic flux field as they form; the field varies according to the degree of drop deflection desired. This results in a controlled deflection by electrostatic charge on each droplet. Charged droplets may be separated by one or more uncharged \\"guard droplets\\" to minimize electrostatic repulsion between neighboring droplets. The droplets pass through another electrostatic or magnetic field and are directed (deflected) by electrostatic deflection plates or flux field to print on the receptor material (substrate), or allowed to continue on undeflected to a collection gutter for re-use. The more highly charged droplets are deflected to a greater degree. Only a small fraction of the droplets is used to print, the majority being recycled. CIJ is one of the oldest (1951) ink jet technologies in use and is fairly mature. Drop-On-Demand was not invented until later. The major advantages of CIJ are the very high velocity (‚âà20 m/s) of the ink droplets, which allows for a relatively long distance between print head and substrate, and the very high drop ejection frequency, allowing for very high speed printing. Another advantage is freedom from nozzle clogging as the jet is always in use, therefore allowing volatile solvents such as ketones and alcohols to be employed, giving the ink the ability to \\"bite\\" into the substrate and dry quickly. The ink system requires active solvent regulation to counter solvent evaporation during the time of flight (time between nozzle ejection and gutter recycling), and from the venting process whereby air that is drawn into the gutter along with the unused drops is vented from the reservoir. Viscosity is monitored and a solvent (or solvent blend) is added to counteract solvent loss. In the later 1950's heated wax inks became popular with CIJ technologies. In 1971 Johannes F. Gottwald patent US3596285A, Liquid Metal Recorder used molten metal ink with a magnetic Flux field to fabricate formed symbols for signage. This may have been the first 3D metal object printed using magnetic core memory as data to produce each symbol. = Drop- on-demand = There are many ways to produce a Drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet. Common methods include thermal DOD and piezoelectric DOD to speed up the frequency of drops. DOD may use a single nozzle or thousands of nozzles. One DOD process uses software that directs the heads to apply between zero and eight droplets of ink per dot, only where needed. Inkjet fluid materials have expanded to include pastes, epoxies, Hot-Melt materials, biological fluids, etc. DOD is very popular and has an interesting history. Mechanical DOD came first, followed by Electrical methods including Piezoelectric devices and then Thermal or heat expansion methods. Piezoelectric (left) and thermal (right) drop generation schematic. A print head will contain several such nozzles, and will be moved across the page as paper advances through the printer. ; A Canon inkjet with CMYK cartridgesThermal DOD printing:Most consumer inkjet printers, including those from Canon (FINE Cartridge system, see photo), Hewlett- Packard, and Lexmark, use the thermal inkjet process. The idea of using thermal excitation to move tiny drops of ink was developed independently by two groups at roughly the same time: John Vaught and a team at Hewlett- Packard's Corvallis Division, and Canon engineer Ichiro Endo. Initially, in 1977, Endo's team was trying to use the piezoelectric effect to move ink out of the nozzle but noticed that ink shot out of a syringe when it was accidentally heated with a soldering iron. Vaught's work started in late 1978 with a project to develop fast, low-cost printing. The team at HP found that thin-film resistors could produce enough heat to fire an ink droplet. Two years later the HP and Canon teams found out about each other's work. ; :In the thermal inkjet process, the print cartridges consist of a series of tiny chambers, each containing a heater, all of which are constructed by photolithography. To eject a droplet from each chamber, a pulse of current is passed through the heating element causing a rapid vaporization of the ink in the chamber and forming a bubble, which causes a large pressure increase, propelling a droplet of ink onto the paper (hence Canon's trade name of Bubble Jet). The ink's surface tension, as well as the condensation and resultant contraction of the vapor bubble, pulls a further charge of ink into the chamber through a narrow channel attached to an ink reservoir. The inks involved are usually water-based and use either pigments or dyes as the colorant. The inks must have a volatile component to form the vapor bubble; otherwise droplet ejection cannot occur. As no special materials are required, the print head is generally cheaper to produce than in other inkjet technologies. ; Piezoelectric printing nozzle of an EPSON C20 printer.Piezoelectric DOD printing:Piezo's are electrically-polarized devices, just as a magnet is polarized. Most commercial and industrial inkjet printers and some consumer printers (those produced by Epson (see photo) and Brother Industries) use a piezoelectric material in an ink-filled chamber behind each nozzle instead of a heating element. When a voltage is applied, the piezoelectric material changes shape, generating a pressure pulse in the fluid, which pushes a droplet of ink from the nozzle. Single nozzle tubular inkjets actually are fluid resonator chambers and the drops are expelled by sound waves. The 1972 patent called them squeeze tube inkjets but later it was discovered to be acoustical inkjets. Piezoelectric (also called Piezo) inkjet allows a wider variety of inks than thermal inkjet as there is no requirement for a volatile component, and no issue with kogation (buildup of ink residue), but the print heads are more expensive to manufacture due to the use of piezoelectric material (usually PZT, lead zirconium titanate). ; :Piezo inkjet technology is often used on production lines to mark products. For instance, the \\"use-before\\" date is often applied to products with this technique; in this application the head is stationary and the product moves past. This application requires a relatively large gap between the print head and the substrate, but also yields a high speed, a long service life, and low operating cost. ; Thermoplastic/3D printing:Howtek Style Inkjet Nozzle. (Tubular piezo not shown)In the 1970's, the first DOD inks were water-based and higher temperature use was not recommended. In the late 1970's wax and oil based inks were used in some DOD inkjets. In 1984 a small company, Howtek, Inc., found that hot-melt adhesive materials (thermoplastics) could be jetted at 125C by maintaining the piezo poling charge while printing. In 1986 Howtek launched the Pixelmaster solid ink-jetting printer, which opened the door to printing three-dimensional plastic inks and led to a 1992 3D patent, US5136515A. This patent was licensed by the first 3 major 3D printer companies (Sanders Prototype, Inc, Stratasys and 3D Systems). ; :In the late 1980's, Howtek introduced the Braillemaster, a printer that used 4 layers of solid ink per character to create documents in Braille that could be read by people who were blind. ; :Solidscape, Inc., currently uses the Howtek-style thermoplastic materials and Howtek-style single nozzle inkjets (see illustration) very successfully. Ballistic Particle Manufacturing also used the Howtek style materials and inkjets. These inkjets can produce up to 16,000 drops per second and shoot drops at 9 feet per second. Originally designed to only print on standard letter-sized paper sheets they now can print 3D models requiring hundreds of layers. ; :The Thermoplastic inks are sometimes confused with the Thermal (heat expansion) Bubble-jet technology but they are completely different.  Ink formulations  The earliest reference to a Continuous ink jet ink (CIJ) in the 1971 patent US3596285A states \\" The preferred ink is characterized by viscosity and surface tension characteristics such that the liquid will be maintained over span under the force with which it is moving in bridge or stream. Implicit in such requirement is that the pressure applied to the ink in formation of said stream is sufficient to form a jet and to impart enough energy to carry the jet as a continuous liquid mass notwithstanding the defective forces which are or may be applied. Furthermore, the color of the ink and the color of the carrier should be such that good optical contrast is formed there between the following printing. The preferred ink is a \\"hot melt type. That is to say it will assume a solid phase at the temperature of the carrier and liquid phase at some higher temperature. The range of commercially available ink compositions which could meet the requirement of the invention are not know at the present time. However, satisfactory printing according to the invention has been achieved with a conductive metal alloy as ink. It is extremely hard at room temperature and adheres well to the surface of the carrier. The basic problem with inkjet inks is the conflicting requirements for a coloring agent that will stay on the surface vs. rapid dispersement of the carrier fluid. Desktop inkjet printers, as used in offices and homes, tend to use aqueous inks based on a mixture of water, glycol and dyes or pigments. These inks are inexpensive to manufacture but difficult to control on the surface of media, often requiring specially coated media. HP inks contain sulfonated polyazo black dye (commonly used for dyeing leather), nitrates and other compounds. Aqueous inks are mainly used in printers with thermal inkjet heads, as these heads require water to perform the ink-expelling function. While aqueous inks often provide the broadest color gamut and most vivid color, most are not waterproof without specialized coating or lamination after printing. Most Dye-based inks, while usually the least expensive, are subject to rapid fading when exposed to light or ozone. Pigment-based aqueous inks are typically more costly but provide much better long-term durability and ultraviolet resistance. Inks marketed as \\"Archival Quality\\" are usually pigment-based. Some professional wide format printers use aqueous inks, but the majority in professional use today employ a much wider range of inks, most of which require piezo inkjet heads and extensive maintenance: ; Howtek Style Thermoplastic InkSolvent inks: The main ingredient of these inks are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), organic chemical compounds that have high vapor pressures. Color is achieved with pigments rather than dyes for excellent fade-resistance. The chief advantage of solvent inks is that they are comparatively inexpensive and enable printing on flexible, uncoated vinyl substrates, which are used to produce vehicle graphics, billboards, banners and adhesive decals. Disadvantages include the vapour produced by the solvent and the need to dispose of used solvent. Unlike most aqueous inks, prints made using solvent-based inks are generally waterproof and ultraviolet-resistant (for outdoor use) without special over-coatings. The high print speed of many solvent printers demands special drying equipment, usually a combination of heaters and blowers. The substrate is usually heated immediately before and after the print heads apply ink. Solvent inks are divided into two sub- categories: hard solvent ink offers the greatest durability without specialized over-coatings but requires specialized ventilation of the printing area to avoid exposure to hazardous fumes, while Mild or \\"Eco\\" solvent inks, while still not as safe as aqueous inks, are intended for use in enclosed spaces without specialized ventilation of the printing area. Mild solvent inks have rapidly gained popularity in recent years as their color quality and durability have increased while ink cost has dropped significantly. ; UV- curable inks: These inks consist mainly of acrylic monomers with an initiator package. After printing, the ink is cured by exposure to strong UV-light. Ink is exposed to UV radiation where a chemical reaction takes place where the photo-initiators cause the ink components to cross-link into a solid. Typically a shuttered mercury-vapor lamp or UV LED is used for the curing process. Curing processes with high power for short periods of times (microseconds) allow curing inks on thermally sensitive substrates. UV inks do not evaporate, but rather cure or set as a result from this chemical reaction. No material is evaporated or removed, which means about 100% of the delivered volume is used to provide coloration. This reaction happens very quickly, which leads to instant drying that results in a completely cured graphic in a matter of seconds. This also allows for a very fast print process. As a result of this instant chemical reaction no solvents penetrate the substrate once it comes off the printer, which allows for high quality prints. The advantage of UV-curable inks is that they \\"dry\\" as soon as they are cured, they can be applied to a wide range of uncoated substrates, and they produce a very robust image. Disadvantages are that they are expensive, require expensive curing modules in the printer, and the cured ink has a significant volume and so gives a slight relief on the surface. Though improvements are being made in the technology, UV-curable inks, because of their volume, are somewhat susceptible to cracking if applied to a flexible substrate. As such, they are often used in large \\"flatbed\\" printers, which print directly to rigid substrates such as plastic, wood or aluminium where flexibility is not a concern. ; Dye sublimation inks: These inks contain special sublimation dyes and are used to print directly or indirectly on to fabrics which consist of a high percentage of polyester fibres. A heating step causes the dyes to sublimate into the fibers and create an image with strong color and good durability. ; Hot melt inks:These inks consist mainly of waxy compounds which are heated past their melting point to enable printing, and which harden upon hitting the cooled substrate. Hot melt inks are typically used for masking processes and are found in graphic printing. :The earliest Hot melt type ink was patented in 1971 by Johannes F Gottwald, US3596285A, Liquid Metal Recorder was intended for printing. The patent states\\" As used herein the term printing\\" is not intended in a limited sense but includes writing or other symbol or pattern formulation with an ink. The term ink as used is intended to include not only dye or pigment-containing materials, but any flowable substance or composition suited for application to surface for forming symbols, characters or patterns of intelligence by marking. The materials employed in such process can be salvaged for reuse. Another object of the invention is to increase the size of characters.....in terms of material requirements for such large and continuous displays\\".  Printing heads  disposable head (left) and fixed head (right) with ink cartridge (middle) There are two main design philosophies in inkjet head design: fixed-head and disposable head. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. = Fixed head = The fixed-head philosophy provides an inbuilt print head (often referred to as a gaiter- head) that is designed to last for the life of the printer. The idea is that because the head need not be replaced every time the ink runs out, consumable costs can be made lower and the head itself can be more precise than a cheap disposable one, typically requiring no calibration. On the other hand, if a fixed head is damaged, obtaining a replacement head can become expensive, if removing and replacing the head is even possible. If the printer's head cannot be removed, the printer itself will then need to be replaced. Fixed head designs are available in consumer products, but are more likely to be found on industrial high-end printers and large format plotters. In the consumer space, fixed-head printers are manufactured primarily by Epson and Canon; however, many more recent Hewlett-Packard models use a fixed-head, such as the Officejet Pro 8620 and HP's Pagewide series = Disposable head = Ink-jet cartridges The disposable head philosophy uses a print head which is supplied as a part of a replaceable ink cartridge. Every time a cartridge is exhausted, the entire cartridge and print head are replaced with a new one. This adds to the cost of consumables and makes it more difficult to manufacture a high-precision head at a reasonable cost, but also means that a damaged or clogged print head is only a minor problem: the user can simply buy a new cartridge. Hewlett-Packard has traditionally favoured the disposable print head, as did Canon in its early models. This type of construction can also be seen as an effort by printer manufacturers to stem third party ink cartridge assembly replacements, as these would-be suppliers don't have the ability to manufacture specialized print heads. An intermediate method does exist: a disposable ink tank connected to a disposable head, which is replaced infrequently (perhaps every tenth ink tank or so). Most high-volume Hewlett- Packard inkjet printers use this setup, with the disposable print heads used on lower volume models. A similar approach is used by Kodak, where the printhead intended for permanent use is nevertheless inexpensive and can be replaced by the user. Canon now uses (in most models) replaceable print heads which are designed to last the life of the printer, but can be replaced by the user should they become clogged. = Cleaning mechanisms = Video: covering the printhead nozzles with a rubber cap The primary cause of inkjet printing problems is ink drying on the printhead's nozzles, causing the pigments and dyes to dry out and form a solid block of hardened mass that plugs the microscopic ink passageways. Most printers attempt to prevent this drying from occurring by covering the printhead nozzles with a rubber cap when the printer is not in use. Abrupt power losses, or unplugging the printer before it has capped the printhead, can cause the printhead to be left in an uncapped state. Even when the head is capped, this seal is not perfect, and over a period of several weeks the moisture (or other solvent) can still seep out, causing the ink to dry and harden. Once ink begins to collect and harden, the drop volume can be affected, drop trajectory can change, or the nozzle can completely fail to jet ink. To combat this drying, nearly all inkjet printers include a mechanism to reapply moisture to the printhead. Typically there is no separate supply of pure ink-free solvent available to do this job, and so instead the ink itself is used to remoisten the printhead. The printer attempts to fire all nozzles at once, and as the ink sprays out, some of it wicks across the printhead to the dry channels and partially softens the hardened ink. After spraying, a rubber wiper blade is swept across the printhead to spread the moisture evenly across the printhead, and the jets are again all fired to dislodge any ink clumps blocking the channels. Some printers use a supplemental air-suction pump, using the rubber capping station to suck ink through a severely clogged cartridge. The suction pump mechanism is frequently driven by the page feed stepper motor: it is connected to the end of the shaft. The pump only engages when the shaft turns backwards, hence the rollers reversing while head cleaning. Due to the built-in head design, the suction pump is also needed to prime the ink channels inside a new printer, and to reprime the channels between ink tank changes. Professional solvent- and UV- curable ink wide-format inkjet printers generally include a \\"manual clean\\" mode that allows the operator to manually clean the print heads and capping mechanism and to replace the wiper blades and other parts used in the automated cleaning processes. The volume of ink used in these printers often leads to \\"overspray\\" and therefore buildup of dried ink in many places that automated processes are not capable of cleaning. The ink consumed in the cleaning process needs to be collected to prevent ink from leaking in the printer. The collection area is called the spittoon, and in Hewlett Packard printers this is an open plastic tray underneath the cleaning/wiping station. In Epson printers, there is typically a large absorption pad in a pan underneath the paper feed platen. For printers several years old, it is common for the dried ink in the spittoon to form a pile that can stack up and touch the printheads, jamming the printer. Some larger professional printers using solvent inks may employ a replaceable plastic receptacle to contain waste ink and solvent which must be emptied or replaced when full. Labyrinth air vent tubes on the top of an Epson Stylus Photo 5-color ink tank. The long air channels are molded into the top of the tank and the blue label seals the channels into long tubes. The yellow label is removed prior to installation, and opens the tube ends to the atmosphere so that ink can be sprayed onto the paper. Removing the blue label would destroy the tubes and cause the moisture to quickly evaporate There is a second type of ink drying that most printers are unable to prevent. For ink to spray from the cartridge, air must enter to displace the removed ink. The air enters via an extremely long, thin labyrinth tube, up to 10 cm long, wrapping back and forth across the ink tank. The channel is long and narrow to reduce moisture evaporation through the vent tube, but some evaporation still occurs and eventually the ink cartridge dries up from the inside out. To combat this problem, which is especially acute with professional fast-drying solvent inks, many wide-format printer cartridge designs contain the ink in an airtight, collapsible bag that requires no vent. The bag merely shrinks until the cartridge is empty. The frequent cleaning conducted by some printers can consume quite a bit of ink and has a great impact on cost-per-page determinations. Clogged nozzles can be detected by printing a standard test pattern on the page. Some software workaround methods are known for re-routing printing information from a clogged nozzle to a working nozzle. = Ink Delivery Developments = Ink cartridges have been the traditional method for delivering ink to the printhead. Continuous ink system (CISS) inkjet printers connect the printhead either to high-capacity ink tanks or packs, or replenish the built-in cartridges via external tanks connected via tubes, typically a retrofit configuration. Supertank printers‚Äìa subset of CISS printers‚Äìhave high-capacity integrated ink tanks or ink packs, and are manually refilled via ink bottles. When supertank ink systems are paired with disposable printhead technology, replaceable cartridges are used to replace the exhausted print heads.  Advantages  Compared to earlier consumer- oriented color printers, inkjet printers have a number of advantages. They are quieter in operation than impact dot matrix or daisywheel printers. They can print finer, smoother details through higher resolution. Consumer inkjet printers with photographic-quality printing are widely available. In comparison to technologies like thermal wax, dye sublimation, and laser printing, inkjets have the advantage of practically no warm up time, and often lower cost per page. However, low-cost laser printers can have lower per-page costs, at least for black-and-white printing, and possibly for color. For some inkjet printers, monochrome ink sets are available either from the printer manufacturer or from third-party suppliers. These allow the inkjet printer to compete with the silver-based photographic papers traditionally used in black- and-white photography, and provide the same range of tones: neutral, \\"warm\\" or \\"cold\\". When switching between full-color and monochrome ink sets, it is necessary to flush out the old ink from the print head with a cleaning cartridge. Special software or at least a modified device driver are usually required, to deal with the different color mapping. Some types of industrial inkjet printers are now capable of printing at very high speeds, in wide formats, or for a variety of industrial applications ranging from signage, textiles, ceramics and 3-D printing into biomedical applications and conductive circuitry. Leading companies and innovators in hardware include HP, Epson, Canon, Konica Minolta, FujiFilm, EFi, Durst, Brother, Roland, Mimaki, Mutoh and many others worldwide.  Disadvantages  Many \\"intelligent\\" ink cartridges contain a microchip that communicates the estimated ink level to the printer; this may cause the printer to display an error message, or incorrectly inform the user that the ink cartridge is empty. In some cases, these messages can be ignored, but some inkjet printers will refuse to print with a cartridge that declares itself empty, to prevent consumers from refilling cartridges. For example, Epson embeds a chip which prevents printing when the chip claims the cartridge is empty, although a researcher who over- rode the system found that in one case he could print up to 38% more good quality pages, even though the chip stated that the cartridge was empty. Third-party ink suppliers sell ink cartridges at significant discounts (at least 10‚Äì30% off OEM cartridge prices, sometimes up to 95%, typically averaging around 50%), and also bulk ink and cartridge self-refill kits at even lower prices. Many vendors' \\"intelligent\\" ink cartridges have been reverse-engineered. It is now possible to buy inexpensive devices to reliably reset such cartridges to report themselves as full, so that they may be refilled many times. The very narrow inkjet nozzles are prone to clogging. The ink consumed cleaning them‚Äîeither during cleaning invoked by the user, or in many cases, performed automatically by the printer on a routine schedule‚Äîcan account for a significant proportion of the ink used in the machine. Inkjet printing head nozzles can be cleaned using specialized solvents; or by soaking in warm distilled water for short periods of time, for water-soluble inks. The high cost of OEM ink cartridges and the intentional obstacles to refilling them have been addressed by the growth of third-party ink suppliers. Many printer manufacturers discourage customers from using third-party inks, stating that they can damage the print heads due to not being the same formulation as the OEM inks, cause leaks, and produce inferior-quality output (e.g. of incorrect color gamut). Consumer Reports has noted that some third- party cartridges may contain less ink than OEM cartridges, and thus yield no cost savings, while Wilhelm Imaging Research claims that with third-party inks the lifetime of prints may be considerably reduced. However, an April 2007 review showed that, in a double-blind test, reviewers generally preferred the output produced using third-party ink over OEM ink. In general, OEM inks have undergone significant system reliability testing with the cartridge and print- head materials, whereas R&D; efforts on third-party ink material compatibility are likely to be significantly less. Some inkjet manufacturers have tried to prevent cartridges being refilled using various schemes including fitting chips to the cartridges that log how much the cartridge has printed and prevent the operation of a refilled cartridge. The warranty on a printer may not apply if the printer is damaged by the use of non-approved supplies. In the US the Magnuson‚ÄìMoss Warranty Act is a federal law which states that warrantors cannot require that only brand name parts and supplies be used with their products, as some printer manufacturers imply. However, this would not apply if non-approved items cause damage. In the UK, a printer manufacturer cannot lawfully impose such conditions as part of its warranty (Regina Vs Ford Motor Company refers) although many attempt to do so illegally. As long as the product used was sold as being for the printer it was used in, then the sale of goods act applies, and anything so sold must be \\"of merchandisable quality and fit for purpose\\". Moreover, under UK law, it is the retailer and not the manufacturer that is legally liable, for 2 years on electrically operated items specifically, and as such the retailer is where one would seek redress.  Durability  Inkjet documents can have poor to excellent archival durability, depending on the quality of the inks and paper used. If low- quality paper is used, it can yellow and degrade due to residual acid in the untreated pulp; in the worst case, old prints can literally crumble into small particles when handled. High-quality inkjet prints on acid-free paper can last as long as typewritten or handwritten documents on the same paper. Because the ink used in many low-cost consumer inkjets is water-soluble, care must be taken with inkjet-printed documents to avoid even the smallest drop of moisture, which can cause severe \\"blurring\\" or \\"running\\". In extreme cases, even sweaty fingertips during hot humid weather could cause low-quality inks to smear. Similarly, water-based highlighter markers can blur inkjet-printed documents and discolor the highlighter's tip. The lifetime of inkjet prints produced using aqueous inks is generally shorter (although UV-resistant inks are available) than those produced with solvent-based inkjets; however, so- called \\"archival inks\\" have been produced for use in aqueous-based machines which offer extended life. In addition to smearing, gradual fading of many inks can be a problem over time. Print lifetime is highly dependent on the quality and formulation of the ink. The earliest inkjet printers, intended for home and small office applications, used dye-based inks. Even the best dye- based inks are not as durable as pigment-based inks, which are now available for many inkjet printers. Many inkjet printers now utilize pigment based inks which are highly water resistant: at least the black ink is often pigment- based. Resin or silicone protected photopaper is widely available at low cost, introducing complete water and mechanical rub resistance for dye and pigment inks. The photopaper itself must be designed for pigment or for dye inks, as pigment particles are too large to be able to penetrate through dye-only photopaper protection layer. The highest-quality inkjet prints are often called \\"gicl√©e\\" prints, to distinguish them from less-durable and lower-cost prints. However, the use of the term is no guarantee of quality, and the inks and paper used must be carefully investigated before an archivist can rely on their long-term durability. To increase the durability of inkjet printer prints, more attention is needed for the inkjet ink cartridge. One way to treat ink cartridges on an inkjet printer is to maintain the temperature of the printer itself. Excessive variation in space temperature is very bad for printer ink cartridges. The user should prevent the printer becoming too hot or too chilly as the cartridges can dry up. For lasting printer efficiency, the user should ensure the area has a regular and steady temperature level.  Operating cost tradeoffs  Inkjets use solvent-based inks which have much shorter expiration dates compared to laser toner, which has an indefinite shelf life. Inkjet printers tend to clog if not used regularly, whereas laser printers are much more tolerant of intermittent use. Inkjet printers require periodical head cleaning, which consumes a considerable amount of ink, and will drive printing costs higher especially if the printer is unused for long periods. If an inkjet head becomes clogged, third-party ink solvents/head cleaners and replacement heads are available in some cases. The cost of such items may be less expensive compared to a transfer unit for a laser printer, but the laser printer unit has a much longer lifetime between required maintenance. Many inkjet printer models now have permanently installed heads, which cannot be economically replaced if they become irreversibly clogged, resulting in scrapping of the entire printer. On the other hand, inkjet printer designs which use a disposable printhead usually cost significantly more per page than printers using permanent heads. By contrast, laser printers do not have printheads to clog or replace frequently, and usually can produce many more pages between maintenance intervals. Inkjet printers have traditionally produced better quality output than color laser printers when printing photographic material. Both technologies have improved dramatically over time, although the best quality giclee prints favored by artists use what is essentially a high-quality specialized type of inkjet printer.

These are tiny printed circuit boards; a deposit of black epoxy covers the chip itself A common business model for inkjet printers involves selling the actual printer at or below production cost, while dramatically marking up the price of the (proprietary) ink cartridges (a profit model called \\"Freebie marketing\\"). Most current inkjet printers attempt to enforce this product tying by anticompetitive measures such as microchips in the cartridges to hinder the use of third-party or refilled ink cartridges. The microchips monitor usage and report the ink remaining to the printer. Some manufacturers also impose \\"expiration dates\\". When the chip reports that the cartridge is empty (or out of date) the printer stops printing. Even if the cartridge is refilled, the microchip will indicate to the printer that the cartridge is depleted. For many models (especially from Canon), the 'empty' status can be overridden by entering a 'service code' (or sometimes simply by pressing the 'start' button again). For some printers, special circuit \\"flashers\\" are available that reset the quantity of remaining ink to the maximum. Some manufacturers, most notably Epson and Hewlett Packard, have been accused of indicating that a cartridge is depleted while a substantial amount of ink remains. A 2007 study found that most printers waste a significant quantity of ink when they declare a cartridge to be empty. Single-ink cartridges were found to have on average 20% of their ink remaining, though actual figures range from 9% to 64% of the cartridge's total ink capacity, depending on the brand and model of printer. This problem is further compounded with the use of one-piece multi-ink cartridges, which are declared empty as soon as one color runs low. Of great annoyance to many users are those printers that will refuse to print documents requiring only black ink, just because one or more of the color ink cartridges is depleted. In recent years, many consumers have begun to challenge the business practices of printer manufacturers, such as charging up to US$8,000 per gallon (US$2,100 per liter) for printer ink. Alternatives for consumers are cheaper copies of cartridges, produced by third parties, and the refilling of cartridges, using refill kits. Due to the large differences in price caused by OEM markups, there are many companies selling third-party ink cartridges. Most printer manufacturers discourage refilling disposable cartridges or using aftermarket copy cartridges, and say that use of incorrect inks may cause poor image quality due to differences in viscosity, which can affect the amount of ink ejected in a drop, and color consistency, and can damage the printhead. Nonetheless, the use of alternative cartridges and inks has been gaining in popularity, threatening the business model of printer manufacturers. Printer companies such as HP, Lexmark, and Epson have used patents and the DMCA to launch lawsuits against third-party vendors. An anti-trust class-action lawsuit was launched in the US against HP and office supply chain Staples, alleging that HP paid Staples $100 million to keep inexpensive third-party ink cartridges off the shelves. In Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that circumvention of this technique does not violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The European Commission also ruled this practice anticompetitive: it will disappear in newer models sold in the European Union. While the DMCA case dealt with copyright protection, companies also rely on patent protection to prevent copying and refilling of cartridges. For example, if a company devises all of the ways in which their microchips can be manipulated and cartridges can be refilled and patents these methods, they can prevent anyone else from refilling their cartridges. Patents protecting the structure of their cartridges prevent the sale of cheaper copies of the cartridges. For some printer models (notably those from Canon) the manufacturer's own microchip can be removed and fitted to a compatible cartridge thereby avoiding the need to replicate the microchip (and risk prosecution). Other manufacturers embed their microchips deep within the cartridge in an effort to prevent this approach. In 2007 Eastman Kodak entered the inkjet market with its own line of All-In-One printers based on a marketing model that differed from the prevailing practice of selling the printer at a loss while making large profits on replacement ink cartridges. Kodak claimed that consumers could save up to 50 percent on printing by using its lower cost cartridges filled with the company's proprietary pigmented colorants while avoiding the potential problems associated with off-brand inks. This strategy proved unsuccessful and Kodak exited the consumer inkjet printer business in 2012.  Printer types  = Professional models = In addition to the widely used small inkjet printers for home and office, there are professional inkjet printers, some for \\"page-width\\" format printing and many for wide format printing. Page-width format means that the print width ranges from about . \\"Wide format\\" means print width ranging from 24\\" up to 15' (about 60 cm to 5 m). The most common application of page-width printers is in printing high-volume business communications that do not need high-quality layout and color. Particularly with the addition of variable data technologies, the page-width printers are important in billing, tagging, and individualized catalogs and newspapers. The application of most wide format printers is in printing advertising graphics; a lower-volume application is printing of design documents by architects or engineers. But nowadays, there are inkjet printers for digital textile printing up to 64\\" wide with good High Definition image 1440x720 dpi. Another specialty application for inkjets is producing prepress color proofs for printing jobs created digitally. Such printers are designed to give accurate color rendition of how the final image will look (a \\"proof\\") when the job is finally produced on a large volume press such as a four-colour offset lithography press. An example is an Iris printer, whose output is what the French term Gicl√©e was coined for. The largest-volume supplier is Hewlett- Packard, which supply over 90 percent of the market for printers for printing technical drawings. The major products in their Designjet series are the Designjet 500/800, the Designjet T Printer series (including the T1100 and T610), the Designjet 1050 and the Designjet 4000/4500. They also have the HP Designjet 5500, a six-color printer that is used especially for printing graphics as well as the new Designjet Z6100 which sits at the top of the HP Designjet range and features an eight colour pigment ink system. Epson, Kodak, and Canon also manufacture wide-format printers, sold in much smaller numbers than standard printers. Epson has a group of 3 Japanese companies around it that predominantly use Epson piezo printheads and inks: Mimaki, Roland, and Mutoh. Scitex Digital Printing developed high-speed, variable-data, inkjet printers for production printing, but sold its profitable assets associated with the technology to Kodak in 2005 who now market the printers as Kodak Versamark VJ1000, VT3000, and VX5000 printing systems. These roll-fed printers can print at up to 1000 feet per minute. Professional high-volume inkjet printers are made by a range of companies. These printers can range in price from US$35,000 to $2 million. Carriage widths on these units can range from 54\\" to 192\\" (about 1.4 to 5 m), and ink technologies have tended toward solvent, eco-solvent, and UV-curing with a more recent focus toward water- based (aqueous) ink sets. Major applications where these printers are used are for outdoor settings for billboards, truck sides and truck curtains, building graphics and banners, while indoor displays include point-of-sales displays, backlit displays, exhibition graphics, and museum graphics. The major suppliers for professional high-volume, wide- and grand-format printers include: EFI, LexJet, Grapo, Inca, Durst, Oc√©, NUR (now part of Hewlett- Packard), L√ºscher, VUTEk, Scitex Vision (now part of Hewlett-Packard), Mutoh, Mimaki, Roland DG, Seiko I Infotech, IQDEMY, Leggett and Platt, Agfa, Raster Printers, DGI and MacDermid ColorSpan (now part of Hewlett-Packard), swissqprint, SPGPrints (formerly Stork Prints), MS Printing Systems and Digital Media Warehouse. = SOHO multifunction inkjet photo printers = SOHO multifunction inkjet printers for photo printing use up to 6 different inks: * Canon: cyan, yellow, magenta, black, pigment black, gray. 1 pl thermal. * Epson: cyan, yellow, magenta, light cyan, light magenta, black. 1.5 pl piezo variable.

In other words, this invention enables one to inkjet print a food-grade color photograph on a birthday cake's surface. Many bakeries now carry these types of decorations, which are printable using edible inks and dedicated inkjet printers. Edible ink printing can be done using normal home use inkjet printers like Canon Bubble Jet printers with edible ink cartridges installed, and using rice paper or frosting sheets. Inkjet printers and similar technologies are used in the production of many microscopic items. See Microelectromechanical systems. Inkjet printers are used to form conductive traces for circuits, and color filters in LCD and plasma displays. Inkjet printers, especially models produced by Dimatix (now part of Fujifilm), Xennia Technology and Pixdro, are in fairly common use in many labs around the world for developing alternative deposition methods that reduce consumption of expensive, rare, or problematic materials. These printers have been used in the printing of polymer, macromolecular, quantum dot, metallic nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes etc. The applications of such printing methods include organic thin-film transistors, organic light emitting diodes, organic solar cells, sensors, etc. Inkjet technology is used in the emerging field of bioprinting. They are also used for the production of OLED displays.

The tree occurs from the San Rafael Mountains in central Santa Barbara County and the Tehachapi Mountains of southwestern Kern County, south through the Transverse Ranges, to the Cuyamaca Mountains in San Diego County. The tree is shade-tolerant and prefers to grow on slopes. Name Pseudotsuga macrocarpa is a Douglas-fir. The name \\"bigcone spruce\\", though confusing as it is not a spruce species, is often still used, and occurs in place names. Description Pseudotsuga macrocarpa typically grows from in height and in trunk diameter. The growth form is straight, with a conical crown from broad, and a strong and spreading root system. The bark is deeply ridged, composed of thin, woodlike plates separating heavy layers of cork; bark of trees over in diameter is from thick. The main branches are long and spreading with pendulous side shoots. The leaves are needle-like, long, are shed when about 5 years old. The female cones are from long, larger and with thicker scales than those of other douglas-firs, and with exserted tridentine bracts. The seeds are large and heavy, 10 mm long and 8 mm broad, with a short rounded wing 13 mm long; they may be bird or mammal dispersed as the wing is too small to be effective for wind dispersal. Trees start producing seeds at about 20 years of age. The largest known individual of this species is tall, in diameter, and is estimated to be from 600 to 700 years of age. Distribution Pseudotsuga macrocarpa is restricted to the California montane chaparral and woodlands and California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregions of California. It prefers a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot dry summers and wet, mild winters. Annual rainfall during a 30-year period on a bigcone Douglas-fir site in the San Gabriel Mountains averaged and ranged from . Bigcone Douglas-fir occurs between . At low elevation, it occurs near streams in moist, shaded canyons and draws where aspects are mostly north and east. At elevations from , aspects include south- and east-facing slopes. At these elevations, it also grows on sloping hillsides, ridges, and benches. At higher elevations, it occurs on south and west aspects on all types of terrain. The average angle of slope on which it grows is 35 degrees, ranging from level to 90 degrees, although these extremes are uncommon. Ranges the tree is found in, south to north, include:Calflora: Los Angeles County distribution mapCalflora: Ventura County distribution map *Peninsular Ranges Cuyamaca Mountains Palomar Mountains Santa Ana Mountains San Jacinto Mountains *Transverse Ranges San Bernardino Mountains San Gabriel Mountains Santa Susana Mountains San Emigdio Mountains Topatopa Mountains Santa Ynez Mountains San Rafael Mountains Sierra Madre Mountains thumbleftBigcone Douglas-fir cone (left), with a Coast Douglas-fir cone for comparison Ecology Pseudotsuga macrocarpa, has several features to tolerate and survive wildfire, notably the very thick bark, and the presence of numerous adventitious buds on the upper side of the branches; this enables the trees to survive even crown fires which burn off all the branchlets, the apparently dead trees becoming green again the following spring. Wildfire frequencies in the chaparral habitats in which it often grows typically range from 15-50 year intervals. Bigcone Douglas-fir is closely associated with canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) and often establishes itself in its shade; after about 50 years, it emerges above the oak canopy. Pseudotsuga macrocarpa showing branch regeneration after a crown fire through epicormic shoots. Note the charred tree trunks. The number of plant associates in bigcone Douglas-fir communities is usually small. * Common overstory associates include: bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica), gray pine (Pinus sabineana), and white alder (Alnus rhombifolia). * Shrub associates include bigpod ceanothus (Ceanothus megacarpus), red shank (Adenostoma sparsifolium), eastwood manzanita (Arctostaphylos glandulosa), toyon (Heteromoles arbutifolia), several species of sage (Salvia), and coastal sage scrub oak (Quercus dumosa). * Ground cover associates are usually sparse, and may include California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum), wild onion (Allium spp.), scarlet beardtongue (Penstemon ternatus), giant chain fern (Woodwardia fimbriata), and western bracken (Pteridium aquilinum var. pubescens). =Fire ecology= Pseudotsuga macrocarpa populations are suspected to be declining due to possibly larger and more extreme wildland fires with greater frequencies. Major wildfires within its range, since 2003, have clearly proven a reduced extent when compared to early 1930s extents derived from historical aerial photos. Although historical information has provided the opportunity to detect stand level patch changes, post-fire resprouting of older more mature trees and natural regeneration and recruitment of the species into higher canopy has yet to be adequately quantified. One tree species in direct competition with bigcone is Calocedrus decurrens, with preliminary post-fire regeneration of this species exponentially greater than bigcone. After 1 or 2 years after the Station fire in 2009 on the Angeles National Forest, there was an estimated 20:1 cedar:bigcone seedling density in fixed radius plots on Mount Wilson. It may be more appropriate to perform population stability estimates up to 5 yrs or much later (i.e. 20 yrs) after a large conflagration due to the potential for immediate and delayed post-fire sprouting and regeneration and interplant competition, as well as the well-noted strategy of seed germination in shrub understories, which is likely to escape detection by surveyors until much later in its life. Research related to the role of mycorrhizae and its relationship to seed establishment needs evaluated in these vegetation communities due to the suspected role it has with the relationship with water, especially in water-limited systems such as those in the wildlands of southern California. In addition, an aggressive seed cone collection strategy should be drafted for this species which includes extensive collection during large cone production years such as 2013, and should include a tracking system to determine correlations to climatic conditions in order to develop a foundation from which to perform species viability assessments w/ varying future climate scenarios. This tree is being considered for more extensive plantings in semiarid locales. Its favorable qualities include resistance to drought, fire, insects, decay, and damage from ozone, and its aggressive rooting system and tolerance to variable growing medium. The needles of older trees sometimes fade to yellow, drop, and trees appear dead only to sprout with renewed vigor within 2 years. The reason is unknown, although drought or insects may be possible causes. Uses =Wildlife= Bigcone Douglas-fir stands provide habitat for black-tailed deer, black bear, and various small animals. These trees provide preferred spring habitat for black bear in the San Bernardino Mountains. The seeds are eaten by various rodents and birds. =Restoration species= Bigcone Douglas-fir is used for watershed and habitat restoration. The Los Angeles County Department of Forestry has extensively planted the tree over a 50-year period for that purpose. Some hybrids of Pseudotsuga macrocarpa (Bigcone Douglas-fir) √ó Pseudotsuga menziesii (Coast Douglas-fir) show promise for planting on drier restoration sites within the P. menziesii‚àíDouglas-fir natural range. These hybrids produce wood of comparable quality to that of Douglas-fir and have the drought tolerance of bigcone Douglas-fir. =Timber= There is no current commercial market for bigcone Douglas-fir wood due to limited distribution and access. It is heavy, hard, and fine grained but not durable. There is less sapwood than heartwood, and the latter contains pockets of resin. In the past, the wood was used locally for fuel and lumber.

It is native to western North America and is known as Douglas fir, Douglas-fir, Oregon pine, and Columbian pine. Despite its common name, it is not a true fir (i.e. it is not a member of the genus Abies). There are three varieties: coast Douglas-fir (P. menziesii var. menziesii), Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (P. menziesii var. glauca) and Mexican Douglas fir (P. menziesii var. lindleyana). The massive mega-genome of Douglas fir was sequenced in 2017 by the large PineRefSeq consortium, revealing a specialized photosynthetic apparatus in the light-harvesting complex genes. Naming The common name honors David Douglas, a Scottish botanist and collector who first reported the extraordinary nature and potential of the species. The common name is misleading since it is not a true fir, i.e., not a member of the genus Abies. For this reason the name is often written as Douglas-fir (a name also used for the genus Pseudotsuga as a whole). The specific epithet menziesii is after Archibald Menzies, a Scottish physician and rival naturalist to David Douglas. Menzies first documented the tree on Vancouver Island in 1791. Colloquially, the species is also known simply as Doug fir or Douglas pine (although the latter common name may also refer to Pinus douglasiana). Other names for this tree have included Oregon pine, British Columbian pine, Puget Sound pine, Douglas spruce, false hemlock, red fir, or red pine (although again the latter may refer to a different tree species‚ÄîPinus resinosa). One Coast Salish name for the tree, used in the Halkomelem language, is .Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem, Volume I, pp. 213. Galloway, Brent Douglas. In the Lushootseed language, the tree is called . Description Douglas-firs are medium-size to extremely large evergreen trees, tall (although only coast Douglas-firs reach such great heights) and up to in diameter.Brockman, C. Frank (1968). Trees of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. New York: Golden Press. 280 pp. . (Pseudotsuga menziesii, pp. 44‚Äì45). The leaves are flat, soft, linear, long, generally resembling those of the firs, occurring singly rather than in fascicles; they completely encircle the branches, which can be useful in recognizing the species. As the trees grow taller in denser forest, they lose their lower branches, such that the foliage may start as high as off the ground.Russell, Tony; Cutler, Catherine; Walters, Martin (2014). The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Trees of the World. London: Anness Publishing Ltd. 511 pp. . (Pseudotsuga menziesii, p. 120). Douglas-firs in environments with more light may have branches much closer to the ground. Douglas-fir female cone The female cones are pendulous, with persistent scales, unlike those of true firs. They are distinctive in having a long tridentine (three-pointed) bract that protrudes prominently above each scale (it resembles the back half of a mouse, with two feet and a tail). Distribution Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii, the coast Douglas-fir, grows in the coastal regions from west- central British Columbia southward to central California. In Oregon and Washington, its range is continuous from the eastern edge of the Cascades west to the Pacific Coast Ranges and Pacific Ocean. In California, it is found in the Klamath and California Coast Ranges as far south as the Santa Lucia Range, with a small stand as far south as the Purisima Hills in Santa Barbara County. One of the last remaining old growth stands of conifers is in the Mattole Watershed, and is under threat of logging. In the Sierra Nevada, it ranges as far south as the Yosemite region. It occurs from near sea level along the coast to above sea level in the mountains of California. Another variety exists further inland, Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca, the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir or interior Douglas-fir. Interior Douglas-fir intergrades with coast Douglas-fir in the Cascades of northern Washington and southern British Columbia, and from there ranges northward to central British Columbia and southeastward to the Mexican border, becoming increasingly disjunct as latitude decreases and altitude increases. Mexican Douglas-fir (P. lindleyana), which ranges as far south as Oaxaca, is often considered a variety of P. menziesii. Fossils (wood, pollen) of Pseudotsuga are recorded from the Miocene and Pliocene of Europe (Siebengebirge, Gleiwitz, Austria).file:///C:/Users/user/AppData/Local/Temp/SP_2b.pdf. THE GENUS Pseudotsuga: ANCESTRAL HISTORY AND PAST DISTRIBUTION. pp. 23‚Äì24. Ecology Douglas-fir prefers acidic or neutral soils. However, it exhibits considerable morphological plasticity, and on drier sites P. menziesii var. menziesii will generate deeper taproots. Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca exhibits even greater plasticity, occurring in stands of interior temperate rainforest in British Columbia, as well as at the edge of semi-arid sagebrush steppe throughout much of its range, where it generates even deeper taproots than coast Douglas-fir is capable. snag provides nest cavities for birds Mature or \\"old-growth\\" Douglas-fir forest is the primary habitat of the red tree vole (Arborimus longicaudus) and the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Home range requirements for breeding pairs of spotted owls are at least 400 ha () of old growth. Red tree voles may also be found in immature forests if Douglas-fir is a significant component. The red vole nests almost exclusively in the foliage of the trees, typically above the ground, and its diet consists chiefly of Douglas-fir needles. A parasitic plant sometimes utilizing P. menziesii is Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium douglasii). The leaves are also used by the woolly conifer aphid Adelges cooleyi; this 0.5 mm long sap-sucking insect is conspicuous on the undersides of the leaves by the small white \\"fluff spots\\" of protective wax that it produces. It is often present in large numbers, and can cause the foliage to turn yellowish from the damage it causes. Exceptionally, trees may be partially defoliated by it, but the damage is rarely this severe. Among Lepidoptera, apart from some that feed on Pseudotsuga in general (see there) the gelechiid moths Chionodes abella and C. periculella as well as the cone scale-eating tortrix moth Cydia illutana have been recorded specifically on P. menziesii. Mature individual in the Wenatchee Mountains The coast Douglas-fir variety is the dominant tree west of the Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest, occurring in nearly all forest types, competes well on most parent materials, aspects, and slopes. Adapted to a moist, mild climate, it grows larger and faster than Rocky Mountain Douglas- fir. Associated trees include western hemlock, Sitka spruce, sugar pine, western white pine, ponderosa pine, grand fir, coast redwood, western redcedar, California incense-cedar, Lawson's cypress, tanoak, bigleaf maple and several others. Pure stands are also common, particularly north of the Umpqua River in Oregon. Poriol is a flavanone, a type of flavonoid, produced by P. menziesii in reaction to infection by Poria weirii. Uses The species is extensively used in forestry as a plantation tree for softwood timber. The timber is used for joinery, veneer, flooring and construction due to its strength, hardness and durability. It is also naturalised throughout Europe, Argentina and Chile (called Pino Oreg√≥n). In New Zealand it is considered to be an invasive species, called a wilding conifer, and subject to control measures. The species has ornamental value in large parks and gardens. The buds have been used to flavor eau de vie, a clear, colorless fruit brandy. Native Hawaiians built wa ªa kaulua (double-hulled canoes) from coast Douglas- fir logs that had drifted ashore. Douglas-fir has been commonly used as a Christmas tree since the 1920s, and the trees are typically grown on plantations. Douglas-fir pine leaves can be used to make pine-needle tea. Many different Native American groups used the bark, resin, and pine needles to make herbal treatments for various diseases. As of 2012, the only wooden ships still currently in use by the United States Navy are Avenger-class minesweepers, made of Douglas-fir.

Michael Hogan (2008). Douglas-fir: \\"Pseudotsuga menzesii\\", GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg The range is continuous in the northern Rocky Mountains south to eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, Idaho, western and south-central Montana and western Wyoming, but becomes discontinuous further south, confined to \\"sky islands\\" on the higher mountains in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, with only very isolated small populations in eastern Nevada, westernmost Texas, and northern Mexico. It occurs from 600 m altitude in the north of the range, up to 3,000 m, rarely 3,200 m, in the south. Further west towards the Pacific coast, it is replaced by the related coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii), and to the south, it is replaced by Mexican Douglas-fir in high mountains as far south as Oaxaca. Some botanists have grouped Mexican Douglas-fir with P. menziesii var. glauca, but genetic and morphological evidence suggest that Mexican populations should be considered a different variety (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. lindleyana). Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is most commonly treated as a variety (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), but has also been called a subspecies (Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. glauca)Grimshaw, J., & Bayton, R.

The strong ecological and genetic differentiation with intergradation limited primarily to postglacial contact zones in British Columbia supports infraspecific groupings. Some botanists have further split Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir into two varieties,Dallimore, W., & Jackson, A. B. (1966). A Handbook of Coniferae and Ginkgoaceae, 4th ed. Arnold, London. but these are not widely acknowledged and have only limited support from genetic testing. Characteristics Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is a large tree, typically reaching in height and in diameter, with exceptional specimens known to tall, and in diameter. It commonly lives more than 500 years and occasionally more than 1,200 years. The bark on young trees is thin, smooth, gray, and covered with resin blisters. On mature trees, it is moderately thick (), furrowed and corky though much less so than coast Douglas-fir. Foliage The shoots are brown to gray-brown, smooth, though not as smooth as fir shoots, and finely pubescent with scattered short hairs. The buds are a distinctive narrow conic shape, long, with red-brown bud scales. The leaves are spirally arranged but slightly twisted at the base to be upswept above the shoot, needle-like, long, gray-green to blue-green above with a single broad stomatal patch, and with two whitish stomatal bands below. The male (pollen) cones are long, and are typically restricted to, or more abundant on, lower branches. Pollen cones develop over 1 year and wind-dispersed pollen is released for several weeks in the spring. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir cones Left: Shuswap Lake, British Columbia, Canada Right: Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona, U.S. The mature female seed cones are pendent, long, broad when closed, opening to broad. They are produced in spring, purple (sometimes green) at first, maturing orange-brown in the autumn 5‚Äì7 months later. The seeds are long and broad, with a wing. Both coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir produce abundant crops of seed approximately every 2‚Äì11 years. Seed is produced annually except for about 1 year in any 4-to-5-year period. Growth Douglas-fir, British Columbia Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows more slowly than coast Douglas-fir and is also much more cold tolerant. Tolerance of different environmental conditions varies among populations of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, especially among populations from the northern and southern Rockies. However, even nearby populations can differ in cold hardiness. Root morphology is variable, but when unimpeded, a taproot forms within several years. \\"Platelike\\" root morphologies occur where growth is impeded. The most prominent lateral roots begin in the 1st or 2nd year of growth. Most roots in surface soil are \\"long ropelike laterals of secondary and tertiary origin\\". Fine-root production is episodic in response to changing environmental conditions; the average lifespan of fine roots is usually between several days and several weeks. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir reaches reproductive maturity at 12‚Äì15 years. It has winged seeds that are dispersed primarily by wind and gravity. In western Montana clearcuts, seeds were dispersed up to uphill from their source, but seedfall between was only 7% of that found in uncut stands. Other studies determined that seedfall in clearcuts beyond from seed trees was about 3% of seedfall in uncut stands where seed trees are close together. Well-stocked stands have resulted from seedfall from sources distant, but most Douglas-fir seeds fall within of their source. Small amounts of seed are dispersed by mice, chipmunks, and squirrels. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir seeds are disseminated about twice as far as seeds of ponderosa pine. Longevity The oldest accurately-dated Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, 1275 years old, is in New Mexico. This longevity is apparently uncommon; growing on a relatively barren lava field has protected it from fire, animals, and humans. Growth typically slows dramatically between 90 and 140 years of age. In the dry-belt forests of central British Columbia, ages can exceed 500 years on sites normal for the region. The oldest accurately- dated growth ring available for the region is 1475; dates in the 1500s and 1600s are more common for remnant patches that have escaped logging, fire, and other disturbances. Pathology It is affected by the diseases Phaeolus schweinitzii, Armillaria, Phellinus weirii, Fomes annosus, dwarf mistletoe, Dasyscypha canker and Rhabdocline needle cast. Insects It attracts the Douglas fir beetle, western budworm and tussock moth. Ecology Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows on a variety of sites across its wide geographic range. It grows at lower elevations adjacent to and within bunchgrass communities and is also found in upper-elevation subalpine forests. It tends to be most abundant in low- and middle-elevation forests, where it grows over a wide range of aspects, slopes, landforms, and soils. Rocky Mountain Douglas- fir and ponderosa pine, Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah In spring and winter (in British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana) elk browse on south- and southwest- facing Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands, particularly when shrubs and/or grasses are productive. In summer, elk generally are found at higher elevations (outside the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Pacific ponderosa pine zones). During fall, elk use stands of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, western larch, or grand fir with high canopy cover. In parts of Yellowstone National Park, elk browsing is so intensive that young Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir are stunted at in height, with live branches trailing very close to the ground, and branches on the upper two thirds of the tree dead. Low-elevation and south-facing open-structure Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types are often important winter range for white-tailed deer and mule deer. Moose winter in low-elevation Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types in areas where willow thickets, the preferred winter habitat, are lacking; in such areas Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is an important moose food. Chipmunks, mice, voles, and shrews eat large quantities of conifer seeds from the forest floor, and clipped cones are a staple and major part of storage of red squirrels. These animals store a large amount of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir cones or seeds. American marten commonly den in hollow logs. Numerous species of songbirds extract seeds from Douglas-fir cones or forage for seeds on the ground. The most common are the Clark's nutcracker, black-capped chickadee, mountain chickadee, boreal chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, pygmy nuthatch, red crossbill, white-winged crossbill, dark-eyed junco, and pine siskin. Migrating flocks of dark-eyed juncos may consume vast quantities of seeds and freshly germinated seedlings. Woodpeckers commonly feed in the bark of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. Blue grouse forage on needles and buds in winter; they and other birds rely heavily on Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir communities for cover. The Douglas-fir is vulnerable to infestation by a woolly aphid, Adelges cooleyi that also infects the Engelmann spruce to complete its lifecycle. Uses Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is a valuable timber tree. The wood is exceptionally strong and is used for structural timber as well as poles, plywood, pulp, dimensional lumber, railroad ties, mine timbers, log cabins, posts and poles, fencing, and firewood. Other uses listed include \\"machine- stress-rated lumber\\", glued-laminated (Glulam) beams, pallets, furniture, cabinets, doors, flooring, window frames, and other miscellaneous woodwork and millwork. Rocky Mountain Douglas-firs are also cut and sold as Christmas trees.

He was noted for innovations in archaeological methodology, and in the museum display of archaeological and ethnological collections. His international collection of about 22,000 objects was the founding collection of the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford while his collection of English archaeology from the area around Stonehenge forms the basis of the collection at The Salisbury Museum in Wiltshire. Throughout most of his life he used the surname Lane Fox, under which his early archaeological reports are published. In 1880 he adopted the Pitt Rivers name on inheriting from Lord Rivers (a cousin) an estate of more than 32,000 acres in Cranborne Chase. His family name is often spelled as \\"Pitt-Rivers\\".Spelling as \\"Pitt-Rivers\\" e.g. in , , \\"RPR\\", Excavating Pitt- Rivers.

The politicians George Lane-Fox and Sackville Lane-Fox were his uncles. In 1880, Lane Fox inherited the estates of his cousin, Horace Pitt-Rivers, 6th Baron Rivers and with it the remainder of the Richard Rigby fortune. It was \\"an event that transformed his life.\\" He was required to adopt the surname Pitt-Rivers as part of the bequest.

Descendants Augustus and Alice had nine children who reached adulthood; they were born between 1855 and 1866. As they were all born before Augustus took the new surname in 1880, their births are registered under the name of Fox (or Lane-Fox). # Alexander Edward Lane Fox-Pitt-Rivers, 2 November 185519 August 1927. # St. George Lane Fox-Pitt, 14 September 18566 April 1932, electrical engineer, author, and student of psychic phenomena. # William Augustus Lane Fox-Pitt, 9 January 18581945?. # Ursula Katharine Lane Fox-Pitt, 1859?1942. # Lionel Charles Lane Fox-Pitt, 5 November 18601937?. # Alice Augusta Laurentia Lane Fox-Pitt, circa 186211 March 1947. # Agnes Geraldine Fox-Pitt, 25 July 18637 December 1926. # Douglas Henry Lane Fox- Pitt, 17 December 186419 September 1922. # Arthur Algernon Lane Fox-Pitt, 12 April 18666 November 1895. Augustus had several notable descendants. One grandson was the anthropologist, eugenicist, and anti-Semite George Pitt- Rivers, who was interned in 1940 under Defence Regulation 18B. George's children included Michael Pitt-Rivers, and his brother, the anthropologist and ethnographer, Julian A. Pitt-Rivers. A further generation includes Augustus's great-great-grandson, William Fox-Pitt, the equestrian. Military career Lane Fox had a long and successful military career as a staff officer. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, for six months at the age of fourteen and was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards on 16 May 1845 as an ensign. In the course of a thirty-two year military career, albeit much interrupted by leave, he only once saw major front line action, at the Battle of Alma in 1854. In 1851 he became a member of the committee to experiment and report on the respective merits of the army's smoothbore muskets. He was appointed to Woolwich to instruct in the use of the new Mini√© rifle in 1852. Subsequently, he was largely responsible for founding the Hythe school of Musketry in Kent and became its principal instructor, revising its Instruction of Musketry manual. The remainder of his service career revolved around musketry instruction and in 1858 he published a paper On the improvement of the rifle as a weapon for general use. He bought a promotion to Captain on 2 August 1850. He was promoted to the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel of the army \\"for distinguished Service in the Field\\" during the Crimean War. On 15 May 1857, he bought the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Grenadier Guards. The then Brevet-Major Lane Fox, was appointed a member of the Fifth Class of the Order of the Medjidie in 1858 for \\"distinguished services before the enemy during the [Crimean War]\\". He was promoted to colonel on 22 January 1867 and major general in 1877. Pitt Rivers retired in 1882 and was accorded the honorary rank of Lt General. Archaeological career Pitt Rivers' interests in archaeology and ethnology began in the 1850s, during postings overseas, and he became a noted scientist while he was a serving military officer. His interest began with the evolution of the rifle, which extended to other weapons and tools, and he became a collector of artifacts illustrating the development of human invention. His collection became famous, and, after being exhibited in 1874‚Äì1875 at the Bethnal Green Museum, was presented in 1885 to the University of Oxford. He was elected, in the space of five years, to the Ethnological Society of London (1861), the Society of Antiquaries of London (1864) and the Anthropological Society of London (1865). By the time he retired he had amassed ethnographic collections numbering tens of thousands of items from all over the world. Influenced by the evolutionary writings of Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, he arranged them typologically and (within types) chronologically. He viewed archaeology as an extension of anthropology and, as consequence, built up matching collections of archaeological and ethnographic objects to show longer developmental sequences to support his views on cultural evolution. This style of arrangement, designed to highlight evolutionary trends in human artefacts, was a revolutionary innovation in museum design. Pitt Rivers' ethnological collections form the basis of the Pitt Rivers Museum which is still one of Oxford's attractions. His researches and collections cover periods from the Lower Paleolithic to Roman and medieval times, and extend all over the world. The Pitt Rivers Museum curates more than half a million ethnographic and archaeological artifacts, photographic and manuscript collections from all parts of the world. The museum was founded in 1884 when the university accepted the gift of more than 20,000 artifacts from Pitt Rivers, and awarded him the Doctorate of Civil Law in 1886. He was later named a Fellow of the Royal Society. The collections continue to grow, and the museum has been described as one of the \\"six great ethnological museums of the world\\". Pitt Rivers' Wessex Collection is housed in The Salisbury Museum, not far from Stonehenge. The Wessex Gallery of archaeology opened in 2014, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and other sources. Pitt Rivers and other early archaeologists such as William Stukeley who first investigated the prehistory of Wiltshire, Cranborne Chase, Avebury and Stonehenge, are celebrated in the gallery. The estates Pitt Rivers inherited in 1880 contained a wealth of archaeological material from the Roman and Saxon periods. He excavated these over seventeen seasons, from the mid-1880s until his death. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist to work in Britain. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that all artefacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued. This focus on everyday objects as the key to understanding the past broke decisively with past archaeological practice, which verged on treasure hunting. It is Pitt Rivers' most important, and most lasting, scientific legacy. His work inspired Mortimer Wheeler, among others, to add to the scientific approach of archaeological excavation techniques. Pitt Rivers created the Larmer Tree Gardens, a public pleasure garden, on the Rushmore estate near Tollard Royal in Wiltshire. Following the passage of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882, Pitt Rivers became the first Inspector of Ancient Monuments: a post created by anthropologist and parliamentarian John Lubbock who married Pitt Rivers' daughter, Alice. Charged with cataloguing archaeological sites and protecting them from destruction, he worked with his customary methodical zeal but was hampered by the limitations of the law, which gave him little real power over the landowners on whose property the sites stood. On the advice of Pitt-Rivers, Kit's Coty House and Little Kit's Coty House, Kent, were among the first ancient British remains to be protected by the state. Railings were erected around the stones to prevent vandalism.http://www.english- heritage.org.uk/visit/places/kits-coty-house-and-little-kits-coty- house/history/ In 1884 he served as High Sheriff of Dorset. Memorial to Augustus Pitt Rivers in St Peter's Church at Tollard Royal. Advocate for cremation Pitt Rivers was an advocate for cremation. Even though many people believed that it was immoral to destroy a corpse, the cremation movement favored a practical way to dispose of bodies. Pitt Rivers was cremated after his death in 1900.

Environmental engineering is a sub-discipline of civil engineering, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering. Environmental engineering is the application of scientific and engineering principles to improve and maintain the environment to: * protect human health, *protect nature's beneficial ecosystems, *and improve environmental-related enhancement of the quality of human life. Environmental engineers devise solutions for wastewater management, water and air pollution control, recycling, waste disposal, and public health. They design municipal water supply and industrial wastewater treatment systems, and design plans to prevent waterborne diseases and improve sanitation in urban, rural and recreational areas. They evaluate hazardous-waste management systems to evaluate the severity of such hazards, advise on treatment and containment, and develop regulations to prevent mishaps. They implement environmental engineering law, as in assessing the environmental impact of proposed construction projects. Environmental engineers study the effect of technological advances on the environment, addressing local and worldwide environmental issues such as acid rain, global warming, ozone depletion, water pollution and air pollution from automobile exhausts and industrial sources. Most jurisdictions impose licensing and registration requirements for qualified environmental engineers. History = Ancient civilizations = Environmental engineering is a name for work that has been done since early civilizations, as people learned to modify and control the environmental conditions to meet needs. As people recognized that their health was related to the quality of their environment, they built systems to improve it. The ancient Indus Valley Civilization (3300 B.C.E. to 1300 B.C.E.) had advanced control over their water resources. The public work structures found at various sites in the area include wells, public baths, water storage tanks, a drinking water system, and a city-wide sewage collection system. They also had an early canal irrigation system enabling large-scale agriculture. From 4000 to 2000 B.C.E., many civilizations had drainage systems and some had sanitation facilities, including the Mesopotamian Empire, Mohenjo-Daro, Egypt, Crete, and the Orkney Islands in Scotland. The Greeks also had aqueducts and sewer systems that used rain and wastewater to irrigate and fertilize fields. The first aqueduct in Rome was constructed in 312 B.C.E., and from there, they continued to construct aqueducts for irrigation and safe urban water supply during droughts. They also built an underground sewer system as early as the 7th century B.C.E. that fed into the Tiber River, draining marshes to create farmland as well as removing sewage from the city. = Modern era = Very little change was seen from the fall of Rome until the 19th century, where improvements saw increasing efforts focused on public health. Modern environmental engineering began in London in the mid-19th century when Joseph Bazalgette designed the first major sewerage system following the Great Stink. The city's sewer system conveyed raw sewage to the River Thames, which also supplied the majority of the city's drinking water, leading to an outbreak of cholera. The introduction of drinking water treatment and sewage treatment in industrialized countries reduced waterborne diseases from leading causes of death to rarities. The field emerged as a separate academic discipline during the middle of the 20th century in response to widespread public concern about water and air pollution and other environmental degradation. As society and technology grew more complex, they increasingly produced unintended effects on the natural environment. One example is the widespread application of the pesticide DDT to control agricultural pests in the years following World War II. While the agricultural benefits were outstanding and crop yields increased dramatically, reducing world hunger, and malaria was controlled better than ever before, the pesticide brought numerous bird species to the edge of extinction due to its impact on their reproductive cycle. The story of DDT as vividly told in Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962) is considered to be the birth of the modern environmental movement, which led to the modern field of \\"environmental engineering.\\" Education Many universities offer environmental engineering programs through either the department of civil engineering or chemical engineering and also including electronic projects to develop and balance the environmental conditions. Environmental engineers in a civil engineering program often focus on hydrology, water resources management, bioremediation, and water and wastewater treatment plant design. Environmental engineers in a chemical engineering program tend to focus on environmental chemistry, advanced air and water treatment technologies, and separation processes. Some subdivisions of environmental engineering include natural resources engineering and agricultural engineering. Courses for students fall into a few broad classes: *Mechanical engineering courses oriented towards designing machines and mechanical systems for environmental use such as water and wastewater treatment facilities, pumping stations, garbage segregation plants, and other mechanical facilities. *Environmental engineering or environmental systems courses oriented towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment. *Environmental chemistry, sustainable chemistry or environmental chemical engineering courses oriented towards understanding the effects of chemicals in the environment, including any mining processes, pollutants, and also biochemical processes. *Environmental technology courses oriented towards producing electronic or electrical graduates capable of developing devices and artifacts able to monitor, measure, model and control environmental impact, including monitoring and managing energy generation from renewable sources. = Curriculum = The following topics make up a typical curriculum in environmental engineering: #Mass and Energy transfer #Environmental chemistry ##Inorganic chemistry ##Organic Chemistry ##Nuclear Chemistry #Growth models ##Resource consumption ##Population growth ##Economic growth #Risk assessment ##Hazard identification ##Dose-response Assessment ##Exposure assessment ## Risk characterization ## Comparative risk analysis #Water pollution ##Water resources and pollutants ##Oxygen demand ## Pollutant transport ##Water and waste water treatment #Air pollution ## Industry, transportation, commercial and residential emissions ## Criteria and toxic air pollutants ## Pollution modelling (e.g. Atmospheric dispersion modeling) ##Pollution control ## Air pollution and meteorology #Global change ##Greenhouse effect and global temperature ##Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen cycle ##IPCC emissions scenarios ## Oceanic changes (ocean acidification, other effects of global warming on oceans) and changes in the stratosphere (see Physical impacts of climate change) #Solid waste management and resource recovery ##Life cycle assessment ##Source reduction ##Collection and transfer operations ##Recycling ##Waste-to-energy conversion ##Landfill  Applications  =Water supply and treatment= Environmental engineers evaluate the water balance within a watershed and determine the available water supply, the water needed for various needs in that watershed, the seasonal cycles of water movement through the watershed and they develop systems to store, treat, and convey water for various uses. Water is treated to achieve water quality objectives for the end uses. In the case of a potable water supply, water is treated to minimize the risk of infectious disease transmission, the risk of non-infectious illness, and to create a palatable water flavor. Water distribution systems are designed and built to provide adequate water pressure and flow rates to meet various end-user needs such as domestic use, fire suppression, and irrigation. =Wastewater treatment= Sewage treatment plant, AustraliaThere are numerous wastewater treatment technologies. A wastewater treatment train can consist of a primary clarifier system to remove solid and floating materials, a secondary treatment system consisting of an aeration basin followed by flocculation and sedimentation or an activated sludge system and a secondary clarifier, a tertiary biological nitrogen removal system, and a final disinfection process. The aeration basin/activated sludge system removes organic material by growing bacteria (activated sludge). The secondary clarifier removes the activated sludge from the water. The tertiary system, although not always included due to costs, is becoming more prevalent to remove nitrogen and phosphorus and to disinfect the water before discharge to a surface water stream or ocean outfall. =Air pollution management= Scientists have developed air pollution dispersion models to evaluate the concentration of a pollutant at a receptor or the impact on overall air quality from vehicle exhausts and industrial flue gas stack emissions. To some extent, this field overlaps the desire to decrease carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from combustion processes. =Environmental impact assessment and mitigation= Water pollution Environmental engineers apply scientific and engineering principles to evaluate if there are likely to be any adverse impacts to water quality, air quality, habitat quality, flora and fauna, agricultural capacity, traffic, ecology, and noise. If impacts are expected, they then develop mitigation measures to limit or prevent such impacts. An example of a mitigation measure would be the creation of wetlands in a nearby location to mitigate the filling in of wetlands necessary for a road development if it is not possible to reroute the road. In the United States, the practice of environmental assessment was formally initiated on January 1, 1970, the effective date of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Since that time, more than 100 developing and developed nations either have planned specific analogous laws or have adopted procedure used elsewhere. NEPA is applicable to all federal agencies in the United States.  Regulatory agencies  =Environmental Protection Agency= The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is one of the many agencies that work with environmental engineers to solve key issues. An important component of EPA's mission is to protect and improve air, water, and overall environmental quality in order to avoid or mitigate the consequences of harmful effects.

Civil engineering is a related field that deals more with the practical aspects of projects. Construction engineers learn some of the design aspects similar to civil engineers as well as project site management aspects. At the educational level, civil engineering students concentrate primarily on the design work which is more analytical, gearing them toward a career as a design professional. This essentially requires them to take a multitude of challenging engineering science and design courses as part of obtaining a 4-year accredited degree. Education for construction engineers is primarily focused on construction procedures, methods, costs, schedules and personnel management. Their primary concern is to deliver a project on time within budget and of the desired quality. The difference between a construction engineer and a civil engineer is that construction engineering students take basic design courses as well as construction management courses. Work activities Being a sub-discipline of Civil Engineering, construction Engineers apply their knowledge and business, technical and management skills obtained from their undergraduate degree to oversee projects that include bridges, buildings and housing projects. Construction Engineers are heavily involved in the design and management/ allocation of funds in these projects. They are charged with risk analysis, costing and planning. A career in design work does require a professional engineer license (PE). Individuals who pursue this career path are strongly advised to sit for the Engineer in Training exam (EIT), also, referred to as the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam (FE) while in college as it takes five years' (4 years in USA) post-graduate to obtain the PE license. Some state have recently changed the PE license exam pre-requisite of 4 years work experience after graduation to become a licensed Professional Engineer where an EIT is eligible to take the PE Exam in as little as 6 months after taking the FE exam. Entry-level construction engineers position is typically project engineers or assistant project engineers. They are responsible for preparing purchasing requisitions, processing change orders, preparing monthly budgeting reports and handling meeting minutes. The construction management position does not necessarily require a PE license; however, possessing one does make the individual more marketable, as the PE license allows the individual to sign off on temporary structure designs. A construction project. Abilities Construction engineers are problem solvers. They contribute to the creation of infrastructure that best meets the unique demands of its environment. They must be able to understand infrastructure life cycles. When compared and contrasted to design engineers, construction engineers bring to the table their own unique perspectives for solving technical challenges with clarity and imagination. While individuals considering this career path should certainly have a strong understanding of mathematics and science, many other skills are also highly desirable, including critical and analytical thinking, time management, people management and good communication skills. Educational requirements Individuals looking to obtain a construction engineering degree must first ensure that the program is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). ABET accreditation is assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards established by the profession for which it prepares its students. In the US there are currently twenty-five programs that exist in the entire country so careful college consideration is advised. A typical construction engineering curriculum is a mixture of engineering mechanics, engineering design, construction management and general science and mathematics. This usually leads to a Bachelor of Science degree. The B.S. degree along with some design or construction experience is sufficient for most entry-level positions. Graduate schools may be an option for those who want to go further in depth of the construction and engineering subjects taught at the undergraduate level. In most cases construction engineering graduates look to either civil engineering, engineering management or business administration as a possible graduate degree. Job prospects Job prospects for construction engineers generally have a strong cyclical variation. For example, starting in 2008 and continuing until at least 2011, job prospects have been poor due to the collapse of housing bubbles in many parts of the world. This sharply reduced demand for construction, forced construction professionals towards infrastructure construction and therefore increased the competition faced by established and new construction engineers. This increased competition and a core reduction in quantity demand is in parallel with a possible shift in the demand for construction engineers due to the automation of many engineering tasks, overall resulting in reduced prospects for construction engineers. In early 2010, the United States construction industry had a 27% unemployment rate, this is nearly three times higher than the 9.7% national average unemployment rate. The construction unemployment rate (including tradesmen) is comparable to the United States 1933 unemployment rate‚Äîthe lowest point of the Great Depression‚Äîof 25%.http://www.bls.gov/opub/cwc/cm20030124ar03p1.htm Remuneration The average salary for a civil engineer in the UK depends on the sector and more specifically the level of experience of the individual. A 2010 survey of the remuneration and benefits of those occupying jobs in construction and the built environment industry showed that the average salary of a civil engineer in the UK is ¬£29,582. In the United States, as of May 2013, the average was $85,640. The average salary varies depending on experience, for example the average annual salary for a civil engineer with between 3 and 6 years' experience is ¬£23,813. For those with between 14 and 20 years' experience the average is ¬£38,214.

Topics in regional science include, but are not limited to location theory or spatial economics, location modeling, transportation, migration analysis, land use and urban development, interindustry analysis, environmental and ecological analysis, resource management, urban and regional policy analysis, geographical information systems, and spatial data analysis. In the broadest sense, any social science analysis that has a spatial dimension is embraced by regional scientists. Origins Regional science was founded in the late 1940s when some economists began to become dissatisfied with the low level of regional economic analysis and felt an urge to upgrade it. But even in this early era, the founders of regional science expected to catch the interest of people from a wide variety of disciplines. Regional science's formal roots date to the aggressive campaigns by Walter Isard and his supporters to promote the \\"objective\\" and \\"scientific\\" analysis of settlement, industrial location, and urban development. Isard targeted key universities and campaigned tirelessly. Accordingly, the Regional Science Association was founded in 1954, when the core group of scholars and practitioners held its first meetings independent from those initially held as sessions of the annual meetings of the American Economics Association.Isard, Walter. 1975. Introduction to Regional Science. New York: Prentice Hall. A reason for meeting independently undoubtedly was the group's desire to extend the new science beyond the rather restrictive world of economists and have natural scientists, psychologists, anthropologists, lawyers, sociologists, political scientists, planners, and geographers join the club.Isard, Walter. 1975. Introduction to Regional Science. New York: Prentice Hall, p. 6. Now called the Regional Science Association International (RSAI), it maintains subnational and international associations, journals, and a conference circuit (notably in North America, continental Europe, Japan, and South Korea). Membership in the RSAI continues to grow. Seminal publications Topically speaking, regional science took off in the wake of Walter Christaller's book Die Zentralen Orte in S≈±ddeutschland (Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1933; transl. Central Places in Southern Germany, 1966), soon followed by Tord Palander's (1935) Beitr√§ge zur Standortstheorie; August L√∂sch's Die r√§umliche Ordnung der Wirtschaft (Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1940; 2nd rev. edit., 1944; transl. The Economics of Location, 1954) ; and Edgar M. Hoover's two booksLocation Theory and the Shoe and Leather Industry (1938) and The Location of Economic Activity (1948). Other important early publications include: Edward H. Chamberlin's (1950) The Theory of Monopolistic Competition ; Fran√ßois Perroux's (1950) Economic Spaces: Theory and Application; Torsten H√§gerstrand's (1953) Innovationsf√∂rloppet ur Korologisk Synpunkt; Edgar S. Dunn's (1954)The Location of Agricultural Production ; Martin J. Beckmann, C.B McGuire, and Clifford B. Winston's (1956) Studies in the Economics of Transportation; Melvin L. Greenhut's (1956) Plant Location in Theory and Practice; Gunnar Myrdal's (1957) Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions; Albert O. Hirschman's (1958) The Strategy of Economic Development; and Claude Ponsard's (1958) Histoire des Th√©ories √âconomiques Spatiales. Nonetheless, Walter Isard's first book in 1956, Location and Space Economy, apparently captured the imagination of many, and his third, Methods of Regional Analysis, published in 1960, only sealed his position as the father of the field. As is typically the case, the above works were built on the shoulders of giants. Much of this predecessor work is documented well in Walter Isard's Location and Space EconomyIsard, Walter. 1956. Location and Space-Economy: A General Theory Relating to Industrial Location, Market Areas, Land Use, Trade and Urban Structure Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. as well as Claude Ponsard's Histoire des Th√©orie √âconomique Spatiales.Ponsard, Claude. 1958. Histoire des Th√©ories √âconomiques Spatiales. Paris: Librairie Armand Colin (Translated in 1983 by Benjamin H. Stevens, Margaret Chevallier and Joaquin P. Pujol as History of Spatial Economic Theory. Springer-Verlag: New York.) Particularly important was the contribution by 19th century German economists to location theory. The early German hegemony more or less starts with Johann Heinrich von Th√ºnen and runs through both Wilhelm Launhardt and Alfred Weber to Walter Christaller and August L√∂sch. Core journals If an academic discipline is identified by its journals, then technically regional science began in 1955 with the publication of the first volume of the Papers and Proceedings, Regional Science Association (now Papers in Regional Science published by Springer). In 1958, the Journal of Regional Science followed. Since the 1970s, the number of journals serving the field has exploded. The RSAI website displays most of them. Most recently the journal Spatial Economic Analysis has been published by the RSAI British and Irish Section with the Regional Studies Association. The latter is a separate and growing organisation involving economists, planners, geographers, political scientists, management academics, policymakers, and practitioners.Regional Studies Association ‚Äì Home .

Academic programs Walter Isard's efforts culminated in the creation of a few academic departments and several university-wide programs in regional science. At Walter Isard's suggestion, the University of Pennsylvania started the Regional Science Department in 1956. It featured as its first graduate William Alonso and was looked upon by many to be the international academic leader for the field. Another important graduate and faculty member of the department is Masahisa Fujita. The core curriculum of this department was microeconomics, input-output analysis, location theory, and statistics. Faculty also taught courses in mathematical programming, transportation economics, labor economics, energy and ecological policy modeling, spatial statistics, spatial interaction theory and models, benefit/cost analysis, urban and regional analysis, and economic development theory, among others. But the department's unusual multidisciplinary orientation undoubtedly encouraged its demise, and it lost its department status in 1993.Boyce, David. 2004. \\"A Short History of the field of Regional Science,\\" Papers in Regional Science, 83, 31‚Äì57.

With a few exceptions, such as Cornell University, which awards graduate degrees in Regional Science,Cornell College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, Department of City and Regional Planning: About Regional Science most practitioners hold positions in departments such as economics, geography, civil engineering, agricultural economics, rural sociology, urban planning, public policy, or demography. The diversity of disciplines participating in regional science have helped make it one of the most interesting and fruitful fields of academic specialization, but it has also made it difficult to fit the many perspectives into a curriculum for an academic major. It is even difficult for authors to write regional science textbooks, since what is elementary knowledge for one discipline might be entirely novel for another.Scott Loveridge discusses the pros and cons of a multidisciplinary field. link Public policy impact Part of the movement was, and continues to be, associated with the political and economic realities of the role of the local community. On any occasion where public policy is directed at the sub- national level, such as a city or group of counties, the methods of regional science can prove useful. Traditionally, regional science has provided policymakers with guidance on the following issues:Classical regional science questions. link :*Determinants of industrial location (both within the nation and region) :*Regional economic impact of the arrival or departure of a firm :*Determinants of internal migration patterns and land-use change :*Regional specialization and exchange :*Environmental impacts of social and economic change :*Geographic association of economic and social conditions By targeting federal resources to specific geographic areas the Kennedy administration realized that political favors could be bought. This is also evident in Europe and other places where local economic areas do not coincide with political boundaries. In the more current era of devolution knowledge about \\"local solutions to local problems\\" has driven much of the interest in regional science. Thus, there has been much political impetus to the growth of the discipline. Developments after 1980 Regional science has enjoyed mixed fortunes since the 1980s. While it has gained a larger following among economists and public policy practitioners, the discipline has fallen out of favor among more radical and post-modernist geographers. In an apparent effort to secure a larger share of research funds, geographers had the National Science Foundation's Geography and Regional Science Program renamed \\"Geography and Spatial Sciences\\". =New economic geography= In 1991, Paul Krugman, as a highly regarded international trade theorist, put out a call for economists to pay more attention to economic geography in a book entitled Geography and Trade, focusing largely on the core regional science concept of agglomeration economies. Krugman's call renewed interest by economists in regional science and, perhaps more importantly, founded what some term the \\"new economic geography\\", which enjoys much common ground with regional science. Broadly trained \\"new economic geographers\\" combine quantitative work with other research techniques, for example at the London School of Economics. The unification of Europe and the increased internationalization of the world's economic, social, and political realms has further induced interest in the study of regional, as opposed to national, phenomena. The new economic geography appears to have garnered more interest in Europe than in America where amenities, notably climate, have been found to better predict human location and re-location patterns, as emphasized in recent work by Mark Partridge. In 2008 Krugman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and his Prize Lecture has references both to work in regional science's location theory as well as economic's trade theory.Paul Krugman's Nobel Prize Lecture 2008. Nobelprize.org (2008-12-08). Retrieved on 2011-06-04. =Criticisms= Today there are dwindling numbers of regional scientists from academic planning programs and mainstream geography departments. Attacks on regional science's practitioners by radical critics began as early as the 1970s, notably David Harvey who believed it lacked social and political commitment. Regional science's founder, Walter Isard, never envisioned regional scientists would be political or planning activists. In fact, he suggested that they will seek to be sitting in front of a computer and surrounded by research assistants. Trevor J. Barnes suggests the decline of regional science practice among planners and geographers in North America could have been avoided. He says \\"It is unreflective, and consequently inured to change, because of a commitment to a God‚Äôs eye view. It is so convinced of its own rightness, of its Archimedean position, that it remained aloof and invariant, rather than being sensitive to its changing local context.\\" Barnes in Canadian J of Reg.

The larger family Zygnemataceae, with well-known genera such as Zygnema and Spirogyra, includes members that grow as unbranched filaments, which grow longer through normal cell division. This group includes the desmids. Most members of both families live in freshwater, and form an important component of the algal scum that grows on or near plants, rocks, and various debris. Systematically they fall within the division Charophyta/Streptophyta, in which the land plants (Embryophyta) emerged.http://esciencenews.com/articles/2011/04/17/ancestors.land.plants.revealed Sexual reproduction in Zygnematales takes place through a process called conjugation. Here filaments of opposite gender line up, and tubes form between corresponding cells. The male cells then become amoeboid and crawl across, or sometimes both cells crawl into the tube. The cells then meet and fuse to form a zygote, which later undergoes meiosis to produce new filaments. As in plants, only the female passes chloroplasts on to the offspring. Other conjugating algae are the Mesotaeniaceae, sister of the Zygnematales, and Spirotaenia, a basal green algae. Additionally, the Desmidiales appear to have emerged deep within the Zygnematales, and are also conjugating. Gallery File:Netrium oblongum var. cylindricum.jpgNetrium oblongum.

In 1930, he became the first writer from the United States (and the first from the Americas) to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, which was awarded \\"for his vigorous and graphic art of description and his ability to create, with wit and humor, new types of characters.\\" His works are known for their critical views of American capitalism and materialism between the wars. He is also respected for his strong characterizations of modern working women. H. L. Mencken wrote of him, \\"[If] there was ever a novelist among us with an authentic call to the trade ... it is this red-haired tornado from the Minnesota wilds.\\"Bode, Carl (1969) Mencken. Carbondale, Illinois: Southern Illinois University Press. p. 166. Childhood and education The Sinclair Lewis Boyhood Home museum Born February 7, 1885, in the village of Sauk Centre, Minnesota, Lewis began reading books at a young age and kept a diary. He had two older siblings, Fred (born 1875) and Claude (born 1878). His father, Edwin J. Lewis, was a physician and a stern disciplinarian who had difficulty relating to his sensitive, unathletic third son. Lewis's mother, Emma Kermott Lewis, died in 1891. The following year, Edwin Lewis married Isabel Warner, whose company young Lewis apparently enjoyed. Throughout his lonely boyhood, the ungainly Lewis‚Äîtall, extremely thin, stricken with acne and somewhat pop-eyed‚Äîhad trouble making friends and pined after various local girls. At the age of 13, he unsuccessfully ran away from home, wanting to become a drummer boy in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.Schorer, 3‚Äì22. In late 1902, Lewis left home for a year at Oberlin Academy (the then-preparatory department of Oberlin College) to qualify for acceptance at Yale University. While at Oberlin, he developed a religious enthusiasm that waxed and waned for much of his remaining teenage years. He entered Yale in 1903, but did not receive his bachelor's degree until 1908, having taken time off to work at Helicon Home Colony, Upton Sinclair's cooperative-living colony in Englewood, New Jersey, and to travel to Panama. Lewis's unprepossessing looks, \\"fresh\\" country manners and seemingly self-important loquacity made it difficult for him to win and keep friends at Oberlin and Yale. He did initiate a few relatively long-lived friendships among students and professors, some of whom recognized his promise as a writer.Schorer, 47‚Äì136 Lewis later became an atheist.Kauffman, Bill. America First!: Its History, Culture, and Politics. Amherst, NY: Prometheus, 1995. Print. \\"Sinclair Lewis was...town atheist...\\" Pg. 118 Early career Lewis's earliest published creative work‚Äîromantic poetry and short sketches‚Äîappeared in the Yale Courant and the Yale Literary Magazine, of which he became an editor. After graduation Lewis moved from job to job and from place to place in an effort to make ends meet, write fiction for publication and to chase away boredom. While working for newspapers and publishing houses (and for a time at the Carmel-by-the-Sea, California writers' colony), he developed a facility for turning out shallow, popular stories that were purchased by a variety of magazines. He also earned money by selling plots to Jack London, including one for the latter's unfinished novel The Assassination Bureau, Ltd. Lewis's first published book was Hike and the Aeroplane, a Tom Swift-style potboiler that appeared in 1912 under the pseudonym Tom Graham. Sinclair Lewis's first serious novel, Our Mr. Wrenn: The Romantic Adventures of a Gentle Man, appeared in 1914, followed by The Trail of the Hawk: A Comedy of the Seriousness of Life (1915) and The Job (1917). That same year also saw the publication of another potboiler, The Innocents: A Story for Lovers, an expanded version of a serial story that had originally appeared in Woman's Home Companion. Free Air, another refurbished serial story, was published in 1919. Marriage and family Lewis with Thompson and son in 1935 In 1914 Lewis married Grace Livingston Hegger (1887‚Äì1981), an editor at Vogue magazine. They had one son, Wells Lewis (1917‚Äì1944), named after British author H. G. Wells. Serving as a U.S. Army lieutenant during World War II, Wells Lewis was killed in action on October 29 amid Allied efforts to rescue the \\"Lost Battalion\\" in France.Steidl, Franz (2008) Lost Battalions: Going for Broke in the Vosges, Autumn 1944.

Dean Acheson, the future Secretary of State, was a neighbor and family friend in Washington, and observed that Sinclair's literary \\"success was not good for that marriage, or for either of the parties to it, or for Lewis's work\\" and the family moved out of town.Acheson, Dean (1962). Morning and Noon, Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. p. 44. Lewis divorced Grace on April 16, 1925 Richard Lingeman, Sinclair Lewis: Rebel from Main Street. On May 14, 1928, he married Dorothy Thompson, a political newspaper columnist. Later in 1928, he and Dorothy purchased a second home in rural Vermont.Lewis, Sinclair (September 23, 1929), \\"Thoughts on Vermont\\", Vermont Weathervane; talk given to the Rutland, Vt. Rotary. They had a son, Michael Lewis (1930-1975), who became a stage actor. Their marriage had virtually ended by 1937, and they divorced in 1942. Commercial success Upon moving to Washington, D.C., Lewis devoted himself to writing. As early as 1916, he began taking notes for a realistic novel about small-town life. Work on that novel continued through mid-1920, when he completed Main Street, which was published on October 23, 1920. His biographer Mark Schorer wrote that the phenomenal success of Main Street \\"was the most sensational event in twentieth-century American publishing history\\".Schorer, 268 Lewis's agent had the most optimistic projection of sales at 25,000 copies. In its first six months, Main Street sold 180,000 copies,Pastore, 91 and within a few years, sales were estimated at two million.Schorer, 235, 263‚Äì69 According to biographer Richard Lingeman, \\"Main Street made [Lewis] rich‚Äîearning him about 4 million current [2018] dollars\\".Lingeman, 156. Sinclair Lewis's former residence in Washington, D.C. Lewis followed up this first great success with Babbitt (1922), a novel that satirized the American commercial culture and boosterism. The story was set in the fictional Midwestern town of Zenith, Winnemac, a setting to which Lewis returned in future novels, including Gideon Planish and Dodsworth. Lewis continued his success in the 1920s with Arrowsmith (1925), a novel about the challenges faced by an idealistic doctor. It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, which Lewis declined,The Sinclair Lewis Society, FAQ Accessed September 15, 2013. still upset that Main Street had not won the prize. It was adapted as a 1931 Hollywood film directed by John Ford and starring Ronald Colman which was nominated for four Academy Awards. Next Lewis published Elmer Gantry (1927), which depicted an evangelical minister as deeply hypocritical. The novel was denounced by many religious leaders and banned in some U.S. cities. It was adapted for the screen more than a generation later as the basis of the 1960 movie starring Burt Lancaster, who earned a Best Actor Oscar for his performance in the title role. The film won two more awards as well. Lewis next published Dodsworth (1929), a novel about the most affluent and successful members of American society. He portrayed them as leading essentially pointless lives in spite of great wealth and advantages. The book was adapted for the Broadway stage in 1934 by Sidney Howard, who also wrote the screenplay for the 1936 film version directed by William Wyler, which was a great success at the time. The film is still highly regarded; in 1990, it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry, and in 2005 Time magazine named it one of the \\"100 Best Movies\\" of the past 80 years.\\"Dodsworth (1936)\\", Time, February 12, 2005. Retrieved June 30, 2010. During the late 1920s and 1930s, Lewis wrote many short stories for a variety of magazines and publications. \\"Little Bear Bongo\\" (1930) is a tale about a bear cub who wants to escape the circus in search of a better life in the real world, first published in Cosmopolitan magazine.Bongo Bear at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

The story was acquired by Walt Disney Pictures in 1940 for a possible feature film. World War II sidetracked those plans until 1947. Disney used the story (now titled \\"Bongo\\") as part of its feature Fun and Fancy Free. Nobel Prize In 1930 Lewis won the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first writer from the United States to receive the award, after he had been nominated by Henrik Sch√ºck, member of the Swedish Academy. In the Academy's presentation speech, special attention was paid to Babbitt. In his Nobel Lecture, Lewis praised Theodore Dreiser, Willa Cather, Ernest Hemingway, and other contemporaries, but also lamented that \\"in America most of us‚Äînot readers alone, but even writers‚Äîare still afraid of any literature which is not a glorification of everything American, a glorification of our faults as well as our virtues,\\" and that America is \\"the most contradictory, the most depressing, the most stirring, of any land in the world today.\\" He also offered a profound criticism of the American literary establishment: \\"Our American professors like their literature clear and cold and pure and very dead.\\" Later years Sinclair Lewis examines Lewis Browne's new novel as they begin their 1943 lecture tour After winning the Nobel Prize, Lewis wrote eleven more novels, ten of which appeared in his lifetime. The best remembered is It Can't Happen Here (1935), a novel about the election of a fascist to the American presidency. After praising Dreiser as \\"pioneering,\\" that he \\"more than any other man, marching alone, usually unappreciated, often hated, has cleared the trail from Victorian and Howellsian timidity and gentility in American fiction to honesty and boldness and passion of life\\" in his Nobel Lecture in December 1930, in March 1931 Lewis publicly accused Dreiser of plagiarizing a book by Dorothy Thompson, Lewis's wife, which led to a well- publicized fight, wherein Dreiser repeatedly slapped Lewis. Thompson initially made the accusation in 1928 regarding her work \\"The New Russia\\" and Dreiser's \\"Dreiser Goes to Russia\\", though the New York Times also linked the dispute to competition between Dreiser and Lewis over the Nobel Prize. Dreiser fired back that Sinclair's 1928 novel Arrowsmith (adapted later that year as a feature film) was unoriginal and that Dreiser himself was first approached to write it, which was disputed by the wife of Arrowsmith's subject, microbiologist Dr. Paul de Kruif. The feud carried on for some months. In 1944, however, Lewis campaigned to have Dreiser recognized by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. After an alcoholic binge in 1937, Lewis checked in for treatment to the Austen Riggs Center, a psychiatric hospital in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. His doctors gave him a blunt assessment that he needed to decide \\"whether he was going to live without alcohol or die by it, one or the other.\\"Lingeman, 420‚Äì422 Lewis checked out after ten days, lacking any \\"fundamental understanding of his problem,\\" as one of his physicians wrote to a colleague. In the autumn of 1940, Lewis visited his old acquaintance, William Ellery Leonard, in Madison, Wisconsin. Leonard arranged a meeting with the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a tour of the campus. Lewis immediately became enthralled with the university and the city and offered to remain and teach a course in creative writing in the upcoming semester. For a month he was quite enamored of his professorial role. Suddenly, on November 7, after giving only five classes to his select group of 24 students, he announced that he had taught them all that he knew. He left Madison the next day. In the 1940s, Lewis and rabbi-turned-popular author Lewis Browne frequently appeared on the lecture platform together,Chamberlain, John (October 7, 1943) \\"Books of the Times\\". Review of See What I Mean? by Lewis Browne. The New York Times. touring the United States and debating before audiences of as many as 3,000 people, addressing such questions as \\"Has the Modern Woman Made Good?\\", \\"The Country Versus the City\\", \\"Is the Machine Age Wrecking Civilization?\\", and \\"Can Fascism Happen Here?\\". The pair were described as \\"the Gallagher and Shean of the lecture circuit\\" by Lewis biographer Richard Lingeman.Lingeman, 455 In the early 1940s, Lewis lived in Duluth, Minnesota. During this time, he wrote the novel Kingsblood Royal (1947), set in the fictional city of Grand Republic, Minnesota, an enlarged and updated version of Zenith. It is based on the Sweet Trials in Detroit in which an African-American doctor was denied the chance to purchase a house in a \\"white\\" section of the city. Kingsblood Royal was a powerful and very early contribution to the civil rights movement. In 1943, Lewis went to Hollywood to work on a script with Dore Schary, who had just resigned as executive head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's low-budget film department to concentrate on writing and producing his own films. The resulting screenplay was Storm In the West, \\"a traditional American western\\" ‚Äî except for the fact that it was also an allegory of World War II, with primary villain Hygatt (Hitler) and his henchmen Gribbles (Goebbels) and Gerrett (Goering) plotting to take over the Franson Ranch, the Poling Ranch, and so on. The screenplay was deemed too political by MGM studio executives and was shelved, and the film was never made. Storm In the West was finally published in 1963, with a foreword by Schary detailing the work's origins, the authors' creative process, and the screenplay's ultimate fate. Sinclair Lewis had been a frequent visitor to Williamstown, Massachusetts. In 1946, he rented Thorvale Farm on Oblong Road. While working on his novel Kingsblood Royal, he purchased this summer estate and upgraded the Georgian mansion along with a farmhouse and many outbuildings. By 1948, Lewis had created a gentleman's farm consisting of 720 acres of agricultural and forest land. His intended residence in Williamstown was short-lived because of his medical problems. =Death= Lewis died in Rome from advanced alcoholism on January 10, 1951, aged 65. His body was cremated and his remains were buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Sauk Centre, Minnesota. His final novel World So Wide (1951) was published posthumously. William Shirer, a friend and admirer of Lewis, disputes accounts that Lewis died of alcoholism. He reported that Lewis had a heart attack and that his doctors advised him to stop drinking if he wanted to live. Lewis did not stop, and perhaps could not; he died when his heart stopped.William L. Shirer, 20th Century Journey: A Memoir of a Life and the Times vol. 1: The Start: 1904‚Äì1930 (NY: Bantam Books, 1980) 458-9 In summarizing Lewis's career, Shirer concludes: =Legacy= Compared to his contemporaries, Lewis' reputation suffered a precipitous decline among literary scholars throughout the 20th century. Despite his enormous popularity during the 1920s, by the 21st century most of his works had been eclipsed in prominence by other writers with less commercial success during the same time period, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Since the 2010s there has been renewed interest in Lewis' work, in particular his 1935 dystopian satire It Can't Happen Here. In the aftermath of the 2016 United States Presidential Election, It Can't Happen Here surged to the top of Amazon's list of best-selling books. He has been honored by the U.S. Postal Service with a postage stamp in the Great Americans series.

In A‚ÄìB, the particle (represented as a ball attached to a spring) oscillates back and forth. In C‚ÄìH, some solutions to the Schr√∂dinger Equation are shown, where the horizontal axis is position, and the vertical axis is the real part (blue) or imaginary part (red) of the wavefunction. C, D, E, F, but not G, H, are energy eigenstates. H is a coherent state‚Äîa quantum state that approximates the classical trajectory. The quantum harmonic oscillator is the quantum-mechanical analog of the classical harmonic oscillator. Because an arbitrary smooth potential can usually be approximated as a harmonic potential at the vicinity of a stable equilibrium point, it is one of the most important model systems in quantum mechanics. Furthermore, it is one of the few quantum-mechanical systems for which an exact, analytical solution is known. One-dimensional harmonic oscillator =Hamiltonian and energy eigenstates= Wavefunction representations for the first eight bound eigenstates, n = 0 to 7. The horizontal axis shows the position x. Corresponding probability densities. The Hamiltonian of the particle is: :\\\\hat H = \\\\frac{{\\\\hat p}^2}{2m} + \\\\frac{1}{2} k {\\\\hat x}^2 = \\\\frac{{\\\\hat p}^2}{2m} + \\\\frac{1}{2} m \\\\omega^2 {\\\\hat x}^2\\\\, , where is the particle's mass, is the force constant, \\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{k}{m}} is the angular frequency of the oscillator, \\\\hat{x} is the position operator (given by ), and \\\\hat{p} is the momentum operator (given by \\\\hat p = - i \\\\hbar {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial x} \\\\,). The first term in the Hamiltonian represents the kinetic energy of the particle, and the second term represents its potential energy, as in Hooke's law. One may write the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation, :: \\\\hat H \\\\left\\\\psi \\\\right\\\\rangle = E \\\\left\\\\psi \\\\right\\\\rangle ~, where denotes a to-be-determined real number that will specify a time-independent energy level, or eigenvalue, and the solution denotes that level's energy eigenstate. One may solve the differential equation representing this eigenvalue problem in the coordinate basis, for the wave function , using a spectral method. It turns out that there is a family of solutions. In this basis, they amount to Hermite functions, : \\\\psi_n(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2^n\\\\,n!}} \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\\\omega}{\\\\pi \\\\hbar}\\\\right)^{1/4} \\\\cdot e^{  \\\\frac{m\\\\omega x^2}{2 \\\\hbar}} \\\\cdot H_n\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m\\\\omega}{\\\\hbar}} x \\\\right), \\\\qquad n = 0,1,2,\\\\ldots. The functions Hn are the physicists' Hermite polynomials, :H_n(z)=(-1)^n~ e^{z^2}\\\\frac{d^n}{dz^n}\\\\left(e^{-z^2}\\\\right). The corresponding energy levels are : E_n = \\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\left(n + {1\\\\over 2}\\\\right)=(2 n + 1) {\\\\hbar \\\\over 2} \\\\omega~. This energy spectrum is noteworthy for three reasons. First, the energies are quantized, meaning that only discrete energy values (integer- plus-half multiples of ) are possible; this is a general feature of quantum- mechanical systems when a particle is confined. Second, these discrete energy levels are equally spaced, unlike in the Bohr model of the atom, or the particle in a box. Third, the lowest achievable energy (the energy of the state, called the ground state) is not equal to the minimum of the potential well, but above it; this is called zero-point energy. Because of the zero- point energy, the position and momentum of the oscillator in the ground state are not fixed (as they would be in a classical oscillator), but have a small range of variance, in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The ground state probability density is concentrated at the origin, which means the particle spends most of its time at the bottom of the potential well, as one would expect for a state with little energy. As the energy increases, the probability density peaks at the classical \\"turning points\\", where the state's energy coincides with the potential energy. (See the discussion below of the highly excited states.) This is consistent with the classical harmonic oscillator, in which the particle spends more of its time (and is therefore more likely to be found) near the turning points, where it is moving the slowest. The correspondence principle is thus satisfied. Moreover, special nondispersive wave packets, with minimum uncertainty, called coherent states oscillate very much like classical objects, as illustrated in the figure; they are not eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. =Ladder operator method= ^2 > for the bound eigenstates, beginning with the ground state (n = 0) at the bottom and increasing in energy toward the top. The horizontal axis shows the position and brighter colors represent higher probability densities. The \\"ladder operator\\" method, developed by Paul Dirac, allows extraction of the energy eigenvalues without directly solving the differential equation. It is generalizable to more complicated problems, notably in quantum field theory. Following this approach, we define the operators and its adjoint , :\\\\begin{align} a &=\\\\sqrt{m\\\\omega \\\\over 2\\\\hbar} \\\\left(\\\\hat x + {i \\\\over m \\\\omega} \\\\hat p \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ a^\\\\dagger &=\\\\sqrt{m\\\\omega \\\\over 2\\\\hbar} \\\\left(\\\\hat x - {i \\\\over m \\\\omega} \\\\hat p \\\\right) \\\\end{align} This leads to the useful representation of \\\\hat{x} and \\\\hat{p}, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\hat x &= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2 m\\\\omega}}(a^\\\\dagger + a) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hat p &= i\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\hbar m \\\\omega}{2}}(a^\\\\dagger - a) ~. \\\\end{align} The operator is not Hermitian, since itself and its adjoint are not equal. The energy eigenstates , when operated on by these ladder operators, give :\\\\begin{align} a^\\\\daggern\\\\rangle &= \\\\sqrt{n + 1} n + 1\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ an\\\\rangle &= \\\\sqrt{n} n - 1\\\\rangle. \\\\end{align} It is then evident that , in essence, appends a single quantum of energy to the oscillator, while removes a quantum. For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as \\"creation\\" and \\"annihilation\\" operators. From the relations above, we can also define a number operator , which has the following property: :\\\\begin{align} N &= a^\\\\dagger a \\\\\\\\\\\\ N\\\\leftn \\\\right\\\\rangle &= n\\\\leftn \\\\right\\\\rangle. \\\\end{align} The following commutators can be easily obtained by substituting the canonical commutation relation, :[a, a^\\\\dagger] = 1,\\\\qquad[N, a^\\\\dagger] = a^{\\\\dagger},\\\\qquad[N, a] = -a, And the Hamilton operator can be expressed as :\\\\hat H = \\\\hbar\\\\omega\\\\left(N + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right), so the eigenstate of is also the eigenstate of energy. The commutation property yields :\\\\begin{align} Na^{\\\\dagger}n\\\\rangle &= \\\\left(a^\\\\dagger N + [N, a^\\\\dagger]\\\\right)n\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left(a^\\\\dagger N + a^\\\\dagger\\\\right)n\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (n + 1)a^\\\\daggern\\\\rangle, \\\\end{align} and similarly, :Nan\\\\rangle = (n - 1)a n \\\\rangle. This means that acts on to produce, up to a multiplicative constant, , and acts on to produce . For this reason, is called a annihilation operator (\\"lowering operator\\"), and a creation operator (\\"raising operator\\"). The two operators together are called ladder operators. In quantum field theory, and are alternatively called \\"annihilation\\" and \\"creation\\" operators because they destroy and create particles, which correspond to our quanta of energy. Given any energy eigenstate, we can act on it with the lowering operator, , to produce another eigenstate with less energy. By repeated application of the lowering operator, it seems that we can produce energy eigenstates down to . However, since :n = \\\\langle n N n \\\\rangle = \\\\langle n a^\\\\dagger a n \\\\rangle = \\\\Bigl(a n \\\\rangle \\\\Bigr)^\\\\dagger a n \\\\rangle \\\\geqslant 0, the smallest eigen-number is 0, and :a \\\\left0 \\\\right\\\\rangle = 0. In this case, subsequent applications of the lowering operator will just produce zero kets, instead of additional energy eigenstates. Furthermore, we have shown above that :\\\\hat H \\\\left0\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega}{2} \\\\left0\\\\right\\\\rangle Finally, by acting on 0‚ü© with the raising operator and multiplying by suitable normalization factors, we can produce an infinite set of energy eigenstates :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\left0 \\\\right\\\\rangle, \\\\left1 \\\\right\\\\rangle, \\\\left2 \\\\right\\\\rangle, \\\\ldots , \\\\leftn \\\\right\\\\rangle, \\\\ldots\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, such that :\\\\hat H \\\\leftn \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\hbar\\\\omega \\\\left( n + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right) \\\\leftn \\\\right\\\\rangle, which matches the energy spectrum given in the preceding section. Arbitrary eigenstates can be expressed in terms of 0‚ü©, :n\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{(a^\\\\dagger)^n}{\\\\sqrt{n!}} 0\\\\rangle. :Proof: ::\\\\begin{align} \\\\langle n aa^\\\\dagger n \\\\rangle &= \\\\langle n\\\\left([a, a^\\\\dagger] + a^\\\\dagger a\\\\right)n \\\\rangle = \\\\langle n(N + 1)n\\\\rangle = n + 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow a^\\\\dagger n\\\\rangle &= \\\\sqrt{n + 1} n + 1\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrown\\\\rangle &= \\\\frac{a^\\\\dagger}{\\\\sqrt{n}} n - 1 \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{(a^\\\\dagger)^2}{\\\\sqrt{n(n - 1)}} n - 2 \\\\rangle = \\\\cdots = \\\\frac{(a^\\\\dagger)^n}{\\\\sqrt{n!}}0\\\\rangle. \\\\end{align} Analytical questions The preceding analysis is algebraic, using only the commutation relations between the raising and lowering operators. Once the algebraic analysis is complete, one should turn to analytical questions. First, one should find the ground state, that is, the solution of the equation a\\\\psi_0 = 0. In the position representation, this is the first-order differential equation :\\\\left(x+\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{m\\\\omega}\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\right)\\\\psi_0=0, whose solution is easily found to be the Gaussian The normalization constant is C = \\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\\\omega}{\\\\pi \\\\hbar}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{4}}, and satisfies the normalization condition \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}\\\\psi_0(x)^{*}\\\\psi_0(x)dx = 1. :\\\\psi_0(x)=Ce^{-\\\\frac{m\\\\omega x^2}{2\\\\hbar}}. Conceptually, it is important that there is only one solution of this equation; if there were, say, two linearly independent ground states, we would get two independent chains of eigenvectors for the harmonic oscillator. Once the ground state is computed, one can show inductively that the excited states are Hermite polynomials times the Gaussian ground state, using the explicit form of the raising operator in the position representation. One can also prove that, as expected from the uniqueness of the ground state, the Hermite functions energy eigenstates \\\\psi_n constructed by the ladder method form a complete orthonormal set of functions.See Theorem 11.4 in Explicitly connecting with the previous section, the ground state 0‚ü© in the position representation is determined by a0\\\\rangle =0, : \\\\left\\\\langle x \\\\mid a \\\\mid 0 \\\\right\\\\rangle = 0 \\\\qquad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\left(x + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{m\\\\omega}\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\right)\\\\left\\\\langle x\\\\mid 0\\\\right\\\\rangle = 0 \\\\qquad \\\\Rightarrow : \\\\left\\\\langle x\\\\mid 0\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\\\omega}{\\\\pi\\\\hbar}\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\exp\\\\left( -\\\\frac{m\\\\omega}{2\\\\hbar}x^2 \\\\right) = \\\\psi_0 ~, hence : \\\\langle x \\\\mid a^\\\\dagger \\\\mid 0 \\\\rangle = \\\\psi_1 (x) ~, so that \\\\psi_1(x,t)=\\\\langle x \\\\mid e^{-3i\\\\omega t/2} a^\\\\dagger \\\\mid 0 \\\\rangle , and so on. =Natural length and energy scales= The quantum harmonic oscillator possesses natural scales for length and energy, which can be used to simplify the problem. These can be found by nondimensionalization. The result is that, if energy is measured in units of and distance in units of , then the Hamiltonian simplifies to :: H = -\\\\frac{1}{2} {d^2 \\\\over dx^2} +\\\\frac{1}{2} x^2 , while the energy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues simplify to Hermite functions and integers offset by a half, ::\\\\psi_n(x)= \\\\left\\\\langle x \\\\mid n \\\\right\\\\rangle = {1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{2^n n!}}~ \\\\pi^{-1/4} \\\\exp(-x^2 / 2)~ H_n(x), ::E_n = n + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} ~, where are the Hermite polynomials. To avoid confusion, these \\"natural units\\" will mostly not be adopted in this article. However, they frequently come in handy when performing calculations, by bypassing clutter. For example, the fundamental solution (propagator) of , the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger operator for this oscillator, simply boils down to the Mehler kernel,Pauli, W. (2000), Wave Mechanics: Volume 5 of Pauli Lectures on Physics (Dover Books on Physics). ; Section 44.Condon, E. U. (1937). \\"Immersion of the Fourier transform in a continuous group of functional transformations\\", Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 23, 158‚Äì164. online ::\\\\langle x \\\\mid \\\\exp (-itH) \\\\mid y \\\\rangle \\\\equiv K(x,y;t)= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi i \\\\sin t}} \\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\frac{i}{2\\\\sin t}\\\\left ((x^2+y^2)\\\\cos t - 2xy\\\\right )\\\\right )~, where . The most general solution for a given initial configuration then is simply ::\\\\psi(x,t)=\\\\int dy~ K(x,y;t) \\\\psi(y,0) ~. =Coherent states= Time evolution of the probability distribution (and phase, shown as color) of a coherent state with Œ±=3. The coherent states of the harmonic oscillator are special nondispersive wave packets, with minimum uncertainty , whose observables' expectation values evolve like a classical system. They are eigenvectors of the annihilation operator, not the Hamiltonian, and form an overcomplete basis which consequentially lacks orthogonality. The coherent states are indexed by and expressed in the basis as :\\\\alpha\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty n\\\\rangle \\\\langle n \\\\alpha \\\\rangle = e^{-\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\alpha^2} \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{\\\\alpha^n}{\\\\sqrt{n!}} n\\\\rangle = e^{-\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\alpha^2} e^{\\\\alpha a^\\\\dagger} 0\\\\rangle. Because a \\\\left0 \\\\right\\\\rangle = 0 and via the Kermack-McCrae identity, the last form is equivalent to a unitary displacement operator acting on the ground state: \\\\alpha\\\\rangle=e^{\\\\alpha \\\\hat a^\\\\dagger - \\\\alpha^*\\\\hat a}0\\\\rangle = D(\\\\alpha)0\\\\rangle. The position space wave functions are :\\\\psi_\\\\alpha(x')= \\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\\\omega}{\\\\pi\\\\hbar}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{4}} e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\langle\\\\hat{p}\\\\rangle_\\\\alpha x' - \\\\frac{m\\\\omega}{2\\\\hbar}(x' - \\\\langle\\\\hat{x}\\\\rangle_\\\\alpha)^2} . Since coherent states are not energy eigenstates, their time evolution is not a simple shift in wavefunction phase. The time-evolved states are, however, also coherent states but with phase- shifting parameter instead: \\\\alpha(t) = \\\\alpha(0) \\\\exp(-i\\\\omega t). =Highly excited states= Excited state with n=30, with the vertical lines indicating the turning points When is large, the eigenstates are localized into the classical allowed region, that is, the region in which a classical particle with energy can move. The eigenstates are peaked near the turning points: the points at the ends of the classically allowed region where the classical particle changes direction. This phenomenon can be verified through asymptotics of the Hermite polynomials, and also through the WKB approximation. The frequency of oscillation at is proportional to the momentum of a classical particle of energy and position . Furthermore, the square of the amplitude (determining the probability density) is inversely proportional to , reflecting the length of time the classical particle spends near . The system behavior in a small neighborhood of the turning point does not have a simple classical explanation, but can be modeled using an Airy function. Using properties of the Airy function, one may estimate the probability of finding the particle outside the classically allowed region, to be approximately :\\\\frac{2}{n^{1/3}3^{2/3}\\\\Gamma^2(\\\\tfrac{1}{3})}=\\\\frac{1}{n^{1/3}\\\\cdot 7.46408092658...} This is also given, asymptotically, by the integral :\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty}e^{(2n+1)\\\\left (x-\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\sinh(2x) \\\\right )}dx ~. =Phase space solutions= In the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator in several different representations of the quasiprobability distribution can be written in closed form. The most widely used of these is for the Wigner quasiprobability distribution. The Wigner quasiprobability distribution for the energy eigenstate is, in the natural units described above, :F_n(x, p) = \\\\frac{(-1)^n}{\\\\pi \\\\hbar} L_n\\\\left(2(x^2 + p^2)\\\\right) e^{-(x^2 + p^2)} ~, where Ln are the Laguerre polynomials. This example illustrates how the Hermite and Laguerre polynomials are linked through the Wigner map. Meanwhile, the Husimi Q function of the harmonic oscillator eigenstates have an even simpler form. If we work in the natural units described above, we have :Q_n(x,p)=\\\\frac{(x^2+p^2)^n}{n!}\\\\frac{e^{-(x^2+p^2)}}{\\\\pi} This claim can be verified using the Segal‚ÄìBargmann transform. Specifically, since the raising operator in the Segal‚ÄìBargmann representation is simply multiplication by z=x+ip and the ground state is the constant function 1, the normalized harmonic oscillator states in this representation are simply z^n/\\\\sqrt{n!} . At this point, we can appeal to the formula for the Husimi Q function in terms of the Segal‚ÄìBargmann transform. N-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator The one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is readily generalizable to N dimensions, where N = 1, 2, 3, ... . In one dimension, the position of the particle was specified by a single coordinate, x. In N dimensions, this is replaced by N position coordinates, which we label x1, ..., xN. Corresponding to each position coordinate is a momentum; we label these p1, ..., pN. The canonical commutation relations between these operators are : \\\\begin{align} {[}x_i , p_j{]} &= i\\\\hbar\\\\delta_{i,j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {[}x_i , x_j{]} &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ {[}p_i , p_j{]} &= 0 \\\\end{align} The Hamiltonian for this system is : H = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\left( {p_i^2 \\\\over 2m} + {1\\\\over 2} m \\\\omega^2 x_i^2 \\\\right). As the form of this Hamiltonian makes clear, the N-dimensional harmonic oscillator is exactly analogous to N independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators with the same mass and spring constant. In this case, the quantities x1, ..., xN would refer to the positions of each of the N particles. This is a convenient property of the r^2 potential, which allows the potential energy to be separated into terms depending on one coordinate each. This observation makes the solution straightforward. For a particular set of quantum numbers \\\\\\\\{n\\\\\\\\}\\\\equiv \\\\\\\\{n_1, n_2, \\\\dots, n_N\\\\\\\\} the energy eigenfunctions for the N-dimensional oscillator are expressed in terms of the 1-dimensional eigenfunctions as: : \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\psi_{\\\\\\\\{n\\\\\\\\}}\\\\rangle =\\\\prod_{i=1}^N\\\\langle x_i\\\\mid \\\\psi_{n_i}\\\\rangle In the ladder operator method, we define N sets of ladder operators, :\\\\begin{align} a_i &= \\\\sqrt{m\\\\omega \\\\over 2\\\\hbar} \\\\left(x_i + {i \\\\over m \\\\omega} p_i \\\\right), \\\\\\\\\\\\ a^{\\\\dagger}_i &= \\\\sqrt{m \\\\omega \\\\over 2\\\\hbar} \\\\left( x_i - {i \\\\over m \\\\omega} p_i \\\\right). \\\\end{align} By an analogous procedure to the one-dimensional case, we can then show that each of the ai and a‚Ä†i operators lower and raise the energy by ‚Ñèœâ respectively. The Hamiltonian is : H = \\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\, \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\left(a_i^\\\\dagger \\\\,a_i + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right). This Hamiltonian is invariant under the dynamic symmetry group U(N) (the unitary group in N dimensions), defined by : U\\\\, a_i^\\\\dagger \\\\,U^\\\\dagger = \\\\sum_{j=1}^N a_j^\\\\dagger\\\\,U_{ji}\\\\quad\\\\text{for all}\\\\quad U \\\\in U(N), where U_{ji} is an element in the defining matrix representation of U(N). The energy levels of the system are : E = \\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\left[(n_1 + \\\\cdots + n_N) + {N\\\\over 2}\\\\right]. :n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\\\dots \\\\quad (\\\\text{the energy level in dimension } i). As in the one-dimensional case, the energy is quantized. The ground state energy is N times the one-dimensional ground energy, as we would expect using the analogy to N independent one-dimensional oscillators. There is one further difference: in the one-dimensional case, each energy level corresponds to a unique quantum state. In N-dimensions, except for the ground state, the energy levels are degenerate, meaning there are several states with the same energy. The degeneracy can be calculated relatively easily. As an example, consider the 3-dimensional case: Define n = n1 + n2 + n3. All states with the same n will have the same energy. For a given n, we choose a particular n1. Then n2 + n3 = n ‚àí n1. There are n ‚àí n1 + 1 possible pairs {n2, n3}. n2 can take on the values 0 to n ‚àí n1, and for each n2 the value of n3 is fixed. The degree of degeneracy therefore is: : g_n = \\\\sum_{n_1=0}^n n - n_1 + 1 = \\\\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} Formula for general N and n [gn being the dimension of the symmetric irreducible nth power representation of the unitary group U(N)]: : g_n = \\\\binom{N+n-1}{n} The special case N = 3, given above, follows directly from this general equation. This is however, only true for distinguishable particles, or one particle in N dimensions (as dimensions are distinguishable). For the case of N bosons in a one-dimension harmonic trap, the degeneracy scales as the number of ways to partition an integer n using integers less than or equal to N. : g_n = p(N_{-},n) This arises due to the constraint of putting N quanta into a state ket where \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty k n_k = n and \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty n_k = N , which are the same constraints as in integer partition. =Example: 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator= Schr√∂dinger 3D spherical harmonic orbital solutions in 2D density plots; the Mathematica source code that used for generating the plots is at the top The Schr√∂dinger equation of a spherically-symmetric three- dimensional harmonic oscillator can be solved explicitly by separation of variables; see this article for the present case.

Applications =Harmonic oscillators lattice: phonons= We can extend the notion of a harmonic oscillator to a one-dimensional lattice of many particles. Consider a one- dimensional quantum mechanical harmonic chain of N identical atoms. This is the simplest quantum mechanical model of a lattice, and we will see how phonons arise from it. The formalism that we will develop for this model is readily generalizable to two and three dimensions. As in the previous section, we denote the positions of the masses by , as measured from their equilibrium positions (i.e. = 0 if the particle is at its equilibrium position). In two or more dimensions, the are vector quantities. The Hamiltonian for this system is :\\\\mathbf{H} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N {p_i^2 \\\\over 2m} + {1\\\\over 2} m \\\\omega^2 \\\\sum_{\\\\\\\\{ij\\\\\\\\} (nn)} (x_i - x_j)^2 ~, where is the (assumed uniform) mass of each atom, and and are the position and momentum operators for the i th atom and the sum is made over the nearest neighbors (nn). However, it is customary to rewrite the Hamiltonian in terms of the normal modes of the wavevector rather than in terms of the particle coordinates so that one can work in the more convenient Fourier space. We introduce, then, a set of \\"normal coordinates\\" , defined as the discrete Fourier transforms of the s, and \\"conjugate momenta\\" defined as the Fourier transforms of the s, : Q_k = {1\\\\over\\\\sqrt{N}} \\\\sum_{l} e^{ikal} x_l : \\\\Pi_{k} = {1\\\\over\\\\sqrt{N}} \\\\sum_{l} e^{-ikal} p_l ~. The quantity will turn out to be the wave number of the phonon, i.e. 2œÄ divided by the wavelength. It takes on quantized values, because the number of atoms is finite. This preserves the desired commutation relations in either real space or wave vector space : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left[x_l , p_m \\\\right]&=i\\\\hbar\\\\delta_{l,m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[ Q_k , \\\\Pi_{k'} \\\\right] &={1\\\\over N} \\\\sum_{l,m} e^{ikal} e^{-ik'am} [x_l , p_m ] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {i \\\\hbar\\\\over N} \\\\sum_{m} e^{iam(k-k')} = i\\\\hbar\\\\delta_{k,k'} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[ Q_k , Q_{k'} \\\\right] &= \\\\left[ \\\\Pi_k , \\\\Pi_{k'} \\\\right] = 0 ~. \\\\end{align} From the general result : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{l}x_l x_{l+m}&={1\\\\over N}\\\\sum_{kk'}Q_k Q_{k'}\\\\sum_{l} e^{ial\\\\left(k+k'\\\\right)}e^{iamk'}= \\\\sum_{k}Q_k Q_{-k}e^{iamk} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum_{l}{p_l}^2 &= \\\\sum_{k}\\\\Pi_k \\\\Pi_{-k} ~, \\\\end{align} it is easy to show, through elementary trigonometry, that the potential energy term is : {1\\\\over 2} m \\\\omega^2 \\\\sum_{j} (x_j - x_{j+1})^2= {1\\\\over 2} m \\\\omega^2\\\\sum_{k}Q_k Q_{-k}(2-e^{ika}-e^{-ika})= {1\\\\over 2} m \\\\sum_{k}{\\\\omega_k}^2Q_k Q_{-k} ~ , where :\\\\omega_k = \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\omega^2 (1 - \\\\cos(ka))} ~. The Hamiltonian may be written in wave vector space as :\\\\mathbf{H} = {1\\\\over {2m}}\\\\sum_k \\\\left( { \\\\Pi_k\\\\Pi_{-k} } + m^2 \\\\omega_k^2 Q_k Q_{-k} \\\\right) ~. Note that the couplings between the position variables have been transformed away; if the s and s were hermitian(which they are not), the transformed Hamiltonian would describe uncoupled harmonic oscillators. The form of the quantization depends on the choice of boundary conditions; for simplicity, we impose periodic boundary conditions, defining the th atom as equivalent to the first atom. Physically, this corresponds to joining the chain at its ends. The resulting quantization is :k=k_n = {2n\\\\pi \\\\over Na} \\\\quad \\\\hbox{for}\\\\ n = 0, \\\\pm1, \\\\pm2, \\\\ldots , \\\\pm {N \\\\over 2}.\\\\ The upper bound to comes from the minimum wavelength, which is twice the lattice spacing , as discussed above. The harmonic oscillator eigenvalues or energy levels for the mode are ::E_n = \\\\left({1\\\\over2}+n\\\\right)\\\\hbar\\\\omega_k \\\\quad\\\\hbox{for}\\\\quad n=0,1,2,3,\\\\ldots If we ignore the zero-point energy then the levels are evenly spaced at ::\\\\hbar\\\\omega,\\\\, 2\\\\hbar\\\\omega,\\\\, 3\\\\hbar\\\\omega,\\\\, \\\\ldots So an exact amount of energy , must be supplied to the harmonic oscillator lattice to push it to the next energy level. In comparison to the photon case when the electromagnetic field is quantised, the quantum of vibrational energy is called a phonon. All quantum systems show wave-like and particle-like properties. The particle-like properties of the phonon are best understood using the methods of second quantization and operator techniques described later.

Buccaneers were a kind of privateers or free sailors peculiar to the Caribbean Sea during the 17th and 18th centuries. First established on northern Hispaniola as early as 1625, their heyday was from the Restoration in 1660 until about 1688, during a time when governments were not strong enough and did not consistently attempt to suppress them. Originally the name applied to the landless hunters of wild boars and cattle in the largely uninhabited areas of Tortuga and Hispaniola. The meat they caught was smoked over a slow fire in little huts the French called boucanes to make viande boucan√©e ‚Äì jerked meat or jerky ‚Äì which they sold to the corsairs that preyed on the (largely Spanish) shipping and settlements of the Caribbean. Eventually the term was applied to the corsairs and (later) privateers themselves, also known as the Brethren of the Coast. Though corsairs, also known as filibusters or freebooters, were largely lawless, privateers were nominally licensed by the authorities ‚Äì first the French, later the English and Dutch ‚Äì to prey on the Spanish, until their depredations became so severe they were suppressed., pp. 5‚Äì7. First published in the United States by St. Martin's Press, New York [1960] as Brethren of the Coast: Buccaneers of the South Seas. Includes a critical list of sources. Etymology The term buccaneer was taken from the Spanish bucanero and derives from the Caribbean Arawak word buccan, a wooden frame on which Tainos and Caribs slowly roasted or smoked meat, commonly manatee. From it derived the French word boucane and hence the name boucanier for French hunters who used such frames to smoke meat from feral cattle and pigs on Hispaniola. English colonists anglicised the word boucanier to buccaneer. History About 1630, French interlopers were driven away from the island of Hispaniola and fled to nearby Tortuga. French buccaneers were established on northern Hispaniola as early as 1625, but lived at first mostly as hunters rather than robbers; their transition to full-time piracy was gradual and motivated in part by Spanish efforts to wipe out both the buccaneers and the prey animals on which they depended. The buccaneers' migration from Hispaniola's mainland to the more defensible offshore island of Tortuga limited their resources and accelerated their piratical raids. According to Alexandre Exquemelin, the Tortuga buccaneer Pierre Le Grand pioneered the settlers' attacks on galleons making the return voyage to Spain. The Spaniards also tried to drive them out of Tortuga, but the buccaneers were joined by many more French, Dutch, and English adventurers who turned to piracy. They set their eyes on Spanish shipping, generally using small craft to attack galleons in the vicinity of the Windward Passage. With the support and encouragement of rival European powers, they became strong enough to sail for the mainland of Spanish America, known as the Spanish Main, and sacked cities. Perhaps what distinguished the buccaneers from earlier Caribbean sailors was their use of permanent bases in the West Indies. During the mid 17th century, the Bahama Islands attracted many lawless people who had taken over New Providence. Encouraged by its large harbour, they were joined by several pirates who made their living by raiding the Spanish on the coast of Cuba. They called this activity buccaneering. Their principal station was Tortuga, but from time to time they seized other strongholds, like Providence, and they were welcomed with their booty in ports like Port Royal in Jamaica. At first they were international. In 1663 it was estimated that there were fifteen of their ships with nearly a thousand men, English, French, and Dutch, belonging to Jamaica and Tortuga. As time went on and the European governments asserted their authority, the buccaneers first became separated by nationalities and then in time were suppressed altogether, leaving behind only dispersed bands of pirates. English settlers occupying Jamaica began to spread the name buccaneers with the meaning of pirates. The name became universally adopted later in 1684 when the first English translation of Alexandre Exquemelin's book The Buccaneers of America was published. Viewed from London, buccaneering was a budget way to wage war on England's rival, Spain. The English crown licensed buccaneers with letters of marque, legalising their operations in return for a share of their profits. The buccaneers were invited by Jamaica's Governor Thomas Modyford to base ships at Port Royal. The buccaneers robbed Spanish shipping and colonies, and returned to Port Royal with their plunder, making the city the most prosperous in the Caribbean. There even were Royal Navy officers sent to lead the buccaneers, such as Christopher Myngs. Their activities went on irrespective of whether England happened to be at war with Spain or France. Among the leaders of the buccaneers were two Frenchmen, Jean-David Nau, better known as Fran√ßois l'Ollonais, and Daniel Montbars, who destroyed so many Spanish ships and killed so many Spaniards that he was called \\"the Exterminator\\". Another noted leader was Welshman Henry Morgan, who sacked Maracaibo, Portobello, and Panama City, stealing a huge amount from the Spanish. Morgan became rich and went back to England, where he was knighted by Charles II. While the buccaneers were powerful it was not only hostility to Spain, but also lack of authority, that prevented the other states from ending the old state of affairs in which, even when they were at peace with Spain and Portugal in Europe, there was 'no peace beyond the Line'. The West Indies were beyond the range of the European international system. Sometimes this was for their advantage but on the whole, with the intermingled possessions, trade rivalries, and disputes about territorial rights, the local conditions led to conflicts. The West Indies continued to be one of the centres of international strife throughout the eighteenth century though by that time it was regulated in the same way as in Europe, and had become inseparable from the European wars. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1665, de Ruyter attacked Barbados with a strong squadron, and the English had no choice but to base their defence on the buccaneers whom the governor of Jamaica had previously been trying to suppress. They were unmanageable and destroyed where they conquered, but they mastered the Dutch colonies of St. Eustatius and Tobago. In 1666, however, when the French joined the Dutch in the war the weakness of this policy was proved. The English hoped to capture the French plantations of St. Kitts, where there were new settlers of both nations, and so they declined to make a new agreement for neutrality. They made what was intended to be a surprise attack, but was an ignominious failure, and the English settlers in the island had to surrender unconditionally. More than 8,000 of them were shipped away, and their property was seized by the French. Lord Willoughby, the able governor of Barbados, got together an expedition for a counter- stroke, but his fleet was broken up by a hurricane in which he perished. The French captured one island after another. In 1667 naval ships from England regained the command of the sea and made various conquests, but the Peace of Breda re-established the status quo in March of that year. Henry Morgan was knighted in 1674 and became lieutenant-governor of Jamaica. In the late 1670s there was a succession of raids on Spanish ports. In 1680 a party made its way across the Isthmus of Panama and, sailing in captured Spanish ships, pillaged the coasts and commerce of the Pacific. They had not been long on their journey when the Anglo-Spanish treaty of 1680 was signed, which at last stipulated for a real peace beyond the Line and indirectly recognised the right of the English to trade in West Indian waters. When the buccaneers returned by way of Cape Horn in 1682, the survivors found themselves treated as pirates. The French, within a very few years, also controlled their buccaneers, and in the Nine Years' War (1688-1697) they were no longer an important factor. Until about 1688 the governments were not strong enough, and did not consistently attempt, to suppress the buccaneers. In January 1684, Havana responded to the attacks by the buccaneers of the Bahamas in the event known as the Raid on Charles Town. In the 1690s, the old buccaneering ways began to die out, as European governments began to discard the policy of \\"no peace beyond the Line\\". Buccaneers were hard to control; some even embroiled their colonies in unwanted wars. Notably, at the 1697 joint French-buccaneer siege of Cartagena, led by Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis, the buccaneers and the French regulars parted on extremely bitter terms. Less tolerated by local Caribbean officials, buccaneers increasingly turned to legal work or else joined regular pirate crews who sought plunder in the Indian Ocean, the east coast of North America, or West Africa as well as in the Caribbean. Legal status Howard Pyle - Buccaneers attacking a much larger Spanish galleon Sometimes the buccaneers held more or less regular commissions as privateers, and they always preyed upon the Spaniards; but often they became mere pirates and plundered any nation. As a rule, the buccaneers called themselves privateers, and many sailed under the protection of a letter of marque granted by British, French or Dutch authorities. For example, Henry Morgan had some form of legal cover for all of his attacks, and expressed great indignation at being called a \\"corsair\\" by the governor of Panama.Cawthorne, Nigel (2004), Pirates: Blood and Thunder on the High Seas, Book Sales, , p. 92. Nevertheless, these rough men had little concern for legal niceties, and exploited every opportunity to pillage Spanish targets, whether or not a letter of marque was available. Many of the letters of marque used by buccaneers were legally invalid, and any form of legal paper in that illiterate age might be passed off as a letter of marque.Breverton, Terry (2004). The Pirate Dictionary, Pelican, , p. 94. Furthermore, even those buccaneers who had valid letters of marque often failed to observe their terms; Morgan's 1671 attack on Panama, for instance, was not at all authorised by his commission from the governor of Jamaica. The legal status of buccaneers was still further obscured by the practice of the Spanish authorities, who regarded them as heretics and interlopers, and thus hanged or garroted captured buccaneers entirely without regard to whether their attacks were licensed by French or English monarchs. Simultaneously, French and English governors tended to turn a blind eye to the buccaneers' depredations against the Spanish, even when unlicensed. But as Spanish power waned toward the end of the 17th century, the buccaneers' attacks began to disrupt France and England's merchant traffic with Spanish America, such that merchants who had previously regarded the buccaneers as a defence against Spain now saw them as a threat to commerce, and colonial authorities grew hostile. This change in political atmosphere, more than anything else, put an end to buccaneering. Lifestyle A hundred years before the French Revolution, the buccaneer companies were run on lines in which liberty, equality and fraternity were the rule. In a buccaneer camp, the captain was elected and could be deposed by the votes of the crew. The crew, and not the captain, decided whether to attack a particular ship, or a fleet of ships. Spoils were evenly divided into shares; the captain received an agreed amount for the ship, plus a portion of the share of the prize money, usually five or six shares. Crews generally had no regular wages, being paid only from their shares of the plunder, a system called \\"no purchase, no pay\\" by Modyford or \\"no prey, no pay\\" by Exquemelin. There was a strong esprit among buccaneers. This, combined with overwhelming numbers, allowed them to win battles and raids. There was also, for some time, a social insurance system guaranteeing compensation for battle wounds at a worked-out scale.Thomas Salmon (1746), Modern history, or the Present State of All nations, University of Lausanne p. 243 Warfare Howard Pyle - Buccaneers extorting tribute from the citizens of a captured city. =Naval= Buccaneers initially used small boats to attack Spanish galleons surreptitiously, often at night, and climb aboard before the alarm could be raised. Buccaneers were expert marksmen and would quickly kill the helmsman and any officers aboard. Buccaneers' reputation as cruel pirates grew to the point that, eventually, most victims would surrender, hoping they would not be killed. =Land= When buccaneers raided towns, they did not sail into port and bombard the defences, as naval forces typically did. Instead, they secretly beached their ships out of sight of their target, marched overland, and attacked the towns from the landward side, which was usually less fortified. Their raids relied mainly on surprise and speed. The sack of Campeche was considered the first such raid and many others that followed replicated the same techniques including the attack on Veracruz in 1683 and the raid on Cartagena later that same year. Downturn While Spanish authorities always viewed buccaneers as trespassers and a threat to their hegemony in the Caribbean basin, over the second half of the 17th century other European powers learned to perceive them in the same way. These new powers had appropriated and secured territories in the area and needed to protect them. Buccaneers who did not settle down on agriculture or some other acceptable business after the so-called Golden Age of Piracy proved a nuisance to them, too. Spanish anti-pirate practices became thus a model for all recently arrived colonial governments. Some expanded them. Punishments When caught by anti-pirate English authorities, 17th and 18th century buccaneers received justice in a summary fashion, and many ended their lives by \\"dancing the hempen jig\\", a euphemism for hanging. Public executions were a form of entertainment, and people came out to watch them as they would for a sporting event today. Newspapers reported details such as condemned men's last words, the prayers said by the priests, and descriptions of their final moments in the gallows. In England, most executions took place at Execution Dock on the River Thames in London. In the cases of more famous prisoners, usually captains, their punishments extended beyond death. Their bodies were enclosed in iron cages (gibbet) (for which they were measured before their execution) and left to swing in the air until the flesh rotted off them‚Äîa process that could take as long as two years. The bodies of captains such as William \\"Captain\\" Kidd, Charles Vane, William Fly, and Jack Rackham (\\"Calico Jack\\") were all treated this way. It is doubtful many buccaneers got off with just a time in the pillory. However, a pirate who was flogged could very well spend some time in the pillory after being beaten. \\"The most common shaming punishment was confinement in the pillory often with symbols of their crimes.\\" In literature After the threat began to abate, literature brought buccaneers to glory as example of virility and self-reliance. Daniel Defoe‚Äôs works like Robinson Crusoe (1719), Captain Singleton (1720), and A General History of the Pyrates (1724) (purported by Defoe) set the tone for the glamorous ways in which later generations would perceive them.

He was the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901. Born in Paris, Prudhomme originally studied to be an engineer, but turned to philosophy and later to poetry; he declared it as his intention to create scientific poetry for modern times. In character sincere and melancholic, he was linked to the Parnassus school, although, at the same time, his work displays characteristics of its own. Early life Prudhomme was born to a French shopkeeper. Prudhomme attended the Lyc√©e Bonaparte, but eye trouble interrupted his studies. He worked for a while in the Creusot region for the Schneider steel foundry, and then began studying law in a notary's office. The favourable reception of his early poems by the Conf√©rence La Bruy√®re (a student society) encouraged him to begin a literary career. Writing His first collection, Stances et Po√®mes (\\"Stanzas and Poems\\", 1865), was praised by Sainte-Beuve. It included his most famous poem, Le vase bris√©. He published more poetry before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. This war, which he discussed in Impressions de la guerre (1872) and La France (1874), permanently damaged his health. During his career, Prudhomme gradually shifted from the sentimental style of his first books towards a more personal style which unified the formality of the Parnassus school with his interest in philosophical and scientific subjects. One of his inspirations was clearly Lucretius's De rerum natura, whose first book he translated into verse. His philosophy was expressed in La Justice (1878) and Le Bonheur (1888). The extreme economy of means employed in these poems has, however, usually been judged as compromising their poetical quality without advancing their claims as works of philosophy. He was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1881. Another distinction, Chevalier de la L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur, was to follow in 1895. After, Le Bonheur, Prudhomme turned from poetry to write essays on aesthetics and philosophy. He published two important essays: L'Expression dans les beaux-arts (1884) and R√©flexions sur l'art des vers (1892), a series of articles on Blaise Pascal in La Revue des Deux Mondes (1890), and an article on free will (La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre, 1906) in the Revue de m√©taphysique et de morale. Nobel Prize The first writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature (given \\"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of lofty idealism, artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect\\"), he devoted the bulk of the money he received to the creation of a poetry prize awarded by the Soci√©t√© des gens de lettres. He also founded, in 1902, the Soci√©t√© des po√®tes fran√ßais with Jose-Maria de Heredia and Leon Dierx. Death Grave of Sully Prudhomme at P√®re-Lachaise in Paris. At the end of his life, his poor health (which had troubled him ever since 1870) forced him to live almost as a recluse at Ch√¢tenay-Malabry, suffering attacks of paralysis while continuing to work on essays. He died suddenly on 6 September 1907, and was buried at P√®re-Lachaise in Paris.

The convergence of sequences of random variables to some limit random variable is an important concept in probability theory, and its applications to statistics and stochastic processes. The same concepts are known in more general mathematics as stochastic convergence and they formalize the idea that a sequence of essentially random or unpredictable events can sometimes be expected to settle down into a behavior that is essentially unchanging when items far enough into the sequence are studied. The different possible notions of convergence relate to how such a behavior can be characterized: two readily understood behaviors are that the sequence eventually takes a constant value, and that values in the sequence continue to change but can be described by an unchanging probability distribution. Background \\"Stochastic convergence\\" formalizes the idea that a sequence of essentially random or unpredictable events can sometimes be expected to settle into a pattern. The pattern may for instance be *Convergence in the classical sense to a fixed value, perhaps itself coming from a random event *An increasing similarity of outcomes to what a purely deterministic function would produce *An increasing preference towards a certain outcome *An increasing \\"aversion\\" against straying far away from a certain outcome *That the probability distribution describing the next outcome may grow increasingly similar to a certain distribution Some less obvious, more theoretical patterns could be *That the series formed by calculating the expected value of the outcome's distance from a particular value may converge to 0 *That the variance of the random variable describing the next event grows smaller and smaller. These other types of patterns that may arise are reflected in the different types of stochastic convergence that have been studied. While the above discussion has related to the convergence of a single series to a limiting value, the notion of the convergence of two series towards each other is also important, but this is easily handled by studying the sequence defined as either the difference or the ratio of the two series. For example, if the average of n independent random variables Yi, i = 1, ..., n, all having the same finite mean and variance, is given by :X_n = \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\\\,, then as n tends to infinity, converges in probability (see below) to the common mean, Œº, of the random variables Yi. This result is known as the weak law of large numbers. Other forms of convergence are important in other useful theorems, including the central limit theorem. Throughout the following, we assume that (Xn) is a sequence of random variables, and X is a random variable, and all of them are defined on the same probability space (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\operatorname{Pr} ).  Convergence in distribution  {\\\\sigma}(X_n-\\\\mu) will be converging in distribution to the standard normal, the result that follows from the celebrated central limit theorem. header5 = Graphic example data6 = Suppose is an iid sequence of uniform random variables. Let \\\\scriptstyle Z_n = {\\\\scriptscriptstyle\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}}}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i be their (normalized) sums. Then according to the central limit theorem, the distribution of approaches the normal distribution. This convergence is shown in the picture: as grows larger, the shape of the probability density function gets closer and closer to the Gaussian curve. 200px}} With this mode of convergence, we increasingly expect to see the next outcome in a sequence of random experiments becoming better and better modeled by a given probability distribution. Convergence in distribution is the weakest form of convergence typically discussed, since it is implied by all other types of convergence mentioned in this article. However, convergence in distribution is very frequently used in practice; most often it arises from application of the central limit theorem. =Definition= A sequence of real-valued random variables is said to converge in distribution, or converge weakly, or converge in law to a random variable if : \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} F_n(x) = F(x), for every number x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} at which is continuous. Here and are the cumulative distribution functions of random variables and , respectively. The requirement that only the continuity points of should be considered is essential. For example, if are distributed uniformly on intervals , then this sequence converges in distribution to a degenerate random variable . Indeed, for all n when , and for all when . However, for this limiting random variable , even though for all . Thus the convergence of cdfs fails at the point where is discontinuous. Convergence in distribution may be denoted as \\\\ X,\\\\ \\\\ X_n \\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\mathcal{L}}\\\\ X,\\\\ \\\\ X_n \\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{d}\\\\ \\\\mathcal{L}_X, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & X_n \\\\rightsquigarrow X,\\\\ \\\\ X_n \\\\Rightarrow X,\\\\ \\\\ \\\\mathcal{L}(X_n)\\\\to\\\\mathcal{L}(X),\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} }} where \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathcal{L}_X is the law (probability distribution) of . For example, if is standard normal we can write X_n\\\\,\\\\xrightarrow{d}\\\\,\\\\mathcal{N}(0,\\\\,1). For random vectors the convergence in distribution is defined similarly. We say that this sequence converges in distribution to a random -vector if : \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\operatorname{Pr}(X_n\\\\in A) = \\\\operatorname{Pr}(X\\\\in A) for every which is a continuity set of . The definition of convergence in distribution may be extended from random vectors to more general random elements in arbitrary metric spaces, and even to the ‚Äúrandom variables‚Äù which are not measurable ‚Äî a situation which occurs for example in the study of empirical processes. This is the ‚Äúweak convergence of laws without laws being defined‚Äù ‚Äî except asymptotically. In this case the term weak convergence is preferable (see weak convergence of measures), and we say that a sequence of random elements converges weakly to (denoted as ) if : \\\\operatorname{E}^*h(X_n) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\,h(X) for all continuous bounded functions . Here E* denotes the outer expectation, that is the expectation of a ‚Äúsmallest measurable function that dominates ‚Äù. =Properties= * Since , the convergence in distribution means that the probability for to be in a given range is approximately equal to the probability that the value of is in that range, provided is sufficiently large. *In general, convergence in distribution does not imply that the sequence of corresponding probability density functions will also converge. As an example one may consider random variables with densities . These random variables converge in distribution to a uniform U(0, 1), whereas their densities do not converge at all.  However, according to Scheff√©‚Äôs theorem, convergence of the probability density functions implies convergence in distribution. * The portmanteau lemma provides several equivalent definitions of convergence in distribution. Although these definitions are less intuitive, they are used to prove a number of statistical theorems. The lemma states that converges in distribution to if and only if any of the following statements are true:  \\\\Pr(X_n \\\\le x) \\\\to \\\\Pr(X \\\\le x) for all continuity points of x\\\\mapsto \\\\Pr(X \\\\le x);  \\\\operatorname{E}f(X_n) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{E}f(X) for all bounded, continuous functions f (where \\\\operatorname{E} denotes the expected value operator);  \\\\operatorname{E}f(X_n) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{E}f(X) for all bounded, Lipschitz functions f;  \\\\lim\\\\inf \\\\operatorname{E}f(X_n) \\\\ge \\\\operatorname{E}f(X) for all nonnegative, continuous functions f;  \\\\lim\\\\inf \\\\Pr(X_n \\\\in G) \\\\ge \\\\Pr(X \\\\in G) for every open set G;  \\\\lim\\\\sup \\\\Pr(X_n \\\\in F) \\\\le \\\\Pr(X \\\\in F) for every closed set F;  \\\\Pr(X_n \\\\in B) \\\\to \\\\Pr(X \\\\in B) for all continuity sets B of random variable X;  \\\\limsup \\\\operatorname{E}f(X_n) \\\\le \\\\operatorname{E}f(X) for every upper semi-continuous function f bounded above;  \\\\liminf \\\\operatorname{E}f(X_n) \\\\ge \\\\operatorname{E}f(X) for every lower semi-continuous function f bounded below. * The continuous mapping theorem states that for a continuous function , if the sequence converges in distribution to , then converges in distribution to .  Note however that convergence in distribution of to and to does in general not imply convergence in distribution of to or of to . * L√©vy‚Äôs continuity theorem: the sequence converges in distribution to if and only if the sequence of corresponding characteristic functions converges pointwise to the characteristic function of . * Convergence in distribution is metrizable by the L√©vy‚ÄìProkhorov metric. * A natural link to convergence in distribution is the Skorokhod's representation theorem.  Convergence in probability  The basic idea behind this type of convergence is that the probability of an ‚Äúunusual‚Äù outcome becomes smaller and smaller as the sequence progresses. The concept of convergence in probability is used very often in statistics. For example, an estimator is called consistent if it converges in probability to the quantity being estimated. Convergence in probability is also the type of convergence established by the weak law of large numbers. = Definition = A sequence {Xn} of random variables converges in probability towards the random variable X if for all Œµ > 0 : \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\Pr\\\\big(X_n-X> \\\\varepsilon\\\\big) = 0. More explicitly, let be the probability that is outside the ball of radius Œµ centered at X. Then is said to converge in probability to X if for any and any there exists a number N (which may depend on Œµ and Œ¥) such that for all , (the definition of limit). Notice that for the condition to be satisfied, it is not possible that for each n the random variables X and are independent (and thus convergence in probability is a condition on the joint cdf's, as opposed to convergence in distribution, which is a condition on the individual cdf's), unless X is deterministic like for the weak law of large numbers. At the same time, the case of a deterministic X cannot, whenever the deterministic value is a discontinuity point (not isolated), be handled by convergence in distribution, where discontinuity points have to be explicitly excluded. Convergence in probability is denoted by adding the letter p over an arrow indicating convergence, or using the ‚Äúplim‚Äù probability limit operator: \\\\, X_n = X.}} For random elements {Xn} on a separable metric space , convergence in probability is defined similarly by : \\\\forall\\\\varepsilon>0, \\\\Pr\\\\big(d(X_n,X)\\\\geq\\\\varepsilon\\\\big) \\\\to 0. =Properties= * Convergence in probability implies convergence in distribution.[proof] * In the opposite direction, convergence in distribution implies convergence in probability when the limiting random variable X is a constant.[proof] * Convergence in probability does not imply almost sure convergence.[proof] * The continuous mapping theorem states that for every continuous function g(¬∑), if \\\\scriptstyle X_n\\\\xrightarrow{p}X, then also \\\\scriptstyle g(X_n)\\\\xrightarrow{p}g(X). * Convergence in probability defines a topology on the space of random variables over a fixed probability space. This topology is metrizable by the Ky Fan metric: :: d(X,Y) = \\\\inf\\\\\\\\!\\\\big\\\\\\\\{ \\\\varepsilon>0:\\\\ \\\\Pr\\\\big(X-Y>\\\\varepsilon\\\\big)\\\\leq\\\\varepsilon\\\\big\\\\\\\\} :or alternately by this metric :: d(X,Y)=\\\\mathbb E\\\\left[\\\\min(X-Y, 1)\\\\right].  Almost sure convergence  This is the type of stochastic convergence that is most similar to pointwise convergence known from elementary real analysis. =Definition= To say that the sequence converges almost surely or almost everywhere or with probability 1 or strongly towards X means that : \\\\operatorname{Pr}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\\\\\! X_n = X \\\\right) = 1. This means that the values of approach the value of X, in the sense (see almost surely) that events for which does not converge to X have probability 0. Using the probability space (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\operatorname{Pr} ) and the concept of the random variable as a function from Œ© to R, this is equivalent to the statement : \\\\operatorname{Pr}\\\\Big( \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega : \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} X_n(\\\\omega) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\Big) = 1. Using the notion of the limit superior of a sequence of sets, almost sure convergence can also be defined as follows: : \\\\operatorname{Pr}\\\\Big( \\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\big\\\\\\\\{\\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega : X_n(\\\\omega) - X(\\\\omega) > \\\\varepsilon \\\\big\\\\\\\\} \\\\Big) = 0 \\\\quad\\\\text{for all}\\\\quad \\\\varepsilon>0. Almost sure convergence is often denoted by adding the letters a.s. over an arrow indicating convergence: \\\\, X.}}} For generic random elements {Xn} on a metric space (S,d), convergence almost surely is defined similarly: : \\\\operatorname{Pr}\\\\Big( \\\\omega\\\\in\\\\Omega:\\\\, d\\\\big(X_n(\\\\omega),X(\\\\omega)\\\\big)\\\\,\\\\underset{n\\\\to\\\\infty}{\\\\longrightarrow}\\\\,0 \\\\Big) = 1 =Properties= * Almost sure convergence implies convergence in probability (by Fatou's lemma), and hence implies convergence in distribution. It is the notion of convergence used in the strong law of large numbers. * The concept of almost sure convergence does not come from a topology on the space of random variables. This means there is no topology on the space of random variables such that the almost surely convergent sequences are exactly the converging sequences with respect to that topology. In particular, there is no metric of almost sure convergence.  Sure convergence or pointwise convergence To say that the sequence of random variables (Xn) defined over the same probability space (i.e., a random process) converges surely or everywhere or pointwise towards X means :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}X_n(\\\\omega)=X(\\\\omega), \\\\, \\\\, \\\\forall \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega. where Œ© is the sample space of the underlying probability space over which the random variables are defined. This is the notion of pointwise convergence of a sequence of functions extended to a sequence of random variables. (Note that random variables themselves are functions). :\\\\big\\\\\\\\{\\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega \\\\, \\\\, \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}X_n(\\\\omega) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\big\\\\\\\\} = \\\\Omega. Sure convergence of a random variable implies all the other kinds of convergence stated above, but there is no payoff in probability theory by using sure convergence compared to using almost sure convergence. The difference between the two only exists on sets with probability zero. This is why the concept of sure convergence of random variables is very rarely used.  Convergence in mean  Given a real number , we say that the sequence converges in the r-th mean (or in the Lr-norm) towards the random variable X, if the -th absolute moments E(Xnr ) and E(Xr ) of and X exist, and : \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left( X_n-X^r \\\\right) = 0, where the operator E denotes the expected value. Convergence in -th mean tells us that the expectation of the -th power of the difference between X_n and X converges to zero. This type of convergence is often denoted by adding the letter Lr over an arrow indicating convergence: The most important cases of convergence in r-th mean are: * When converges in r-th mean to X for r = 1, we say that converges in mean to X. * When converges in r-th mean to X for r = 2, we say that converges in mean square (or in quadratic mean) to X. Convergence in the r-th mean, for r ‚â• 1, implies convergence in probability (by Markov's inequality). Furthermore, if r > s ‚â• 1, convergence in r-th mean implies convergence in s-th mean. Hence, convergence in mean square implies convergence in mean. It is also worth noticing that if then : \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} E[X_n^r] = E[X^r] Properties Provided the probability space is complete: * If X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ X and X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ Y, then X=Y almost surely. * If X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}\\\\text{a.s.}}\\\\ X and X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}\\\\text{a.s.}}\\\\ Y, then X=Y almost surely. * If X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{L^r}}\\\\ X and X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{L^r}}\\\\ Y, then X=Y almost surely. * If X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ X and Y_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ Y, then aX_n+bY_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ aX+bY (for any real numbers and ) and X_n Y_n\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ XY. * If X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}\\\\text{a.s.}}\\\\ X and Y_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}\\\\text{a.s.}}\\\\ Y, then aX_n+bY_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}\\\\text{a.s.}}\\\\ aX+bY (for any real numbers and ) and X_n Y_n\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}\\\\text{a.s.}}\\\\ XY. * If X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{L^r}}\\\\ X and Y_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{L^r}}\\\\ Y, then aX_n+bY_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{L^r}}\\\\ aX+bY (for any real numbers and ). * None of the above statements are true for convergence in distribution. The chain of implications between the various notions of convergence are noted in their respective sections. They are, using the arrow notation: : \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{L^s}} & \\\\underset{s>r\\\\geq1}{\\\\Rightarrow} & \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{L^r}} & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & \\\\Downarrow & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\text{a.s.}} & \\\\Rightarrow & \\\\xrightarrow{p} & \\\\Rightarrow & \\\\xrightarrow{d} \\\\end{matrix} These properties, together with a number of other special cases, are summarized in the following list: * Almost sure convergence implies convergence in probability:[proof] *:X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\text{a.s.}}\\\\ X \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ X * Convergence in probability implies there exists a sub-sequence (k_n) which almost surely converges: *: X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ X \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad X_{k_n}\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\text{a.s.}}\\\\ X * Convergence in probability implies convergence in distribution:[proof] *: X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ X \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{d}}\\\\ X * Convergence in r-th order mean implies convergence in probability: *: X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{L^r}}\\\\ X \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ X * Convergence in r-th order mean implies convergence in lower order mean, assuming that both orders are greater than or equal to one: *: X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{L^r}}\\\\ X \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{L^s}}\\\\ X, provided r ‚â• s ‚â• 1. * If Xn converges in distribution to a constant c, then Xn converges in probability to c:[proof] *: X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{d}}\\\\ c \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ c, provided c is a constant. * If converges in distribution to X and the difference between Xn and Yn converges in probability to zero, then Yn also converges in distribution to X:[proof] *: X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{d}}\\\\ X,\\\\ \\\\ X_n-Y_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ 0\\\\ \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad Y_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{d}}\\\\ X * If converges in distribution to X and Yn converges in distribution to a constant c, then the joint vector converges in distribution to :[proof] *: X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{d}}\\\\ X,\\\\ \\\\ Y_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{d}}\\\\ c\\\\ \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad (X_n,Y_n)\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{d}}\\\\ (X,c) provided c is a constant. *:Note that the condition that converges to a constant is important, if it were to converge to a random variable Y then we wouldn't be able to conclude that converges to . * If Xn converges in probability to X and Yn converges in probability to Y, then the joint vector converges in probability to :[proof] *: X_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ X,\\\\ \\\\ Y_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ Y\\\\ \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad (X_n,Y_n)\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\overset{}{p}}\\\\ (X,Y) * If converges in probability to X, and if for all n and some b, then converges in rth mean to X for all . In other words, if converges in probability to X and all random variables are almost surely bounded above and below, then converges to X also in any rth mean. * Almost sure representation. Usually, convergence in distribution does not imply convergence almost surely. However, for a given sequence {Xn} which converges in distribution to X0 it is always possible to find a new probability space (Œ©, F, P) and random variables {Yn, n = 0, 1, ...} defined on it such that Yn is equal in distribution to for each , and Yn converges to Y0 almost surely. * If for all Œµ > 0, *::\\\\sum_n \\\\mathbb{P} \\\\left(X_n - X> \\\\varepsilon\\\\right) < \\\\infty, *:then we say that converges almost completely, or almost in probability towards X.

Extreme value theory or extreme value analysis (EVA) is a branch of statistics dealing with the extreme deviations from the median of probability distributions. It seeks to assess, from a given ordered sample of a given random variable, the probability of events that are more extreme than any previously observed. Extreme value analysis is widely used in many disciplines, such as structural engineering, finance, earth sciences, traffic prediction, and geological engineering. For example, EVA might be used in the field of hydrology to estimate the probability of an unusually large flooding event, such as the 100-year flood. Similarly, for the design of a breakwater, a coastal engineer would seek to estimate the 50-year wave and design the structure accordingly.  Data analysis  Two approaches exist for practical extreme value analysis. The first method relies on deriving block maxima (minima) series as a preliminary step. In many situations it is customary and convenient to extract the annual maxima (minima), generating an \\"Annual Maxima Series\\" (AMS). The second method relies on extracting, from a continuous record, the peak values reached for any period during which values exceed a certain threshold (falls below a certain threshold). This method is generally referred to as the \\"Peak Over Threshold\\" method (POT). For AMS data, the analysis may partly rely on the results of the Fisher‚ÄìTippett‚ÄìGnedenko theorem, leading to the generalized extreme value distribution being selected for fitting.Fisher and Tippett (1928)Gnedenko (1943) However, in practice, various procedures are applied to select between a wider range of distributions. The theorem here relates to the limiting distributions for the minimum or the maximum of a very large collection of independent random variables from the same distribution. Given that the number of relevant random events within a year may be rather limited, it is unsurprising that analyses of observed AMS data often lead to distributions other than the generalized extreme value distribution (GEVD) being selected.Embrechts, Kl√ºppelberg, and Mikosch (1997) For POT data, the analysis may involve fitting two distributions: one for the number of events in a time period considered and a second for the size of the exceedances. A common assumption for the first is the Poisson distribution, with the generalized Pareto distribution being used for the exceedances. A tail-fitting can be based on the Pickands‚ÄìBalkema‚Äìde Haan theorem.Pickands (1975)Balkema and de Haan (1974) NovakNovak (2011) reserves the term ‚ÄúPOT method‚Äù to the case where the threshold is non-random, and distinguishes it from the case where one deals with exceedances of a random threshold.

History The field of extreme value theory was pioneered by Leonard Tippett (1902‚Äì1985). Tippett was employed by the British Cotton Industry Research Association, where he worked to make cotton thread stronger. In his studies, he realized that the strength of a thread was controlled by the strength of its weakest fibres. With the help of R. A. Fisher, Tippet obtained three asymptotic limits describing the distributions of extremes assuming independent variables. Emil Julius Gumbel codified this theory in his 1958 book Statistics of Extremes, including the Gumbel distributions that bear his name. These results can be extended to allowing for slight correlations between variables, but the classical theory does not extend to strong correlations of the order of the variance. One universality class of particular interest is that of log-correlated fields, where the correlations decay logarithmically with the distance. A summary of historically important publications relating to extreme value theory can be found in the article List of publications in statistics.  Univariate theory  Let X_1, \\\\dots, X_n be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with cumulative distribution function F and let M_n =\\\\max(X_1,\\\\dots,X_n) denote the maximum. In theory, the exact distribution of the maximum can be derived: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Pr(M_n \\\\leq z) & = \\\\Pr(X_1 \\\\leq z, \\\\dots, X_n \\\\leq z) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\Pr(X_1 \\\\leq z) \\\\cdots \\\\Pr(X_n \\\\leq z) = (F(z))^n. \\\\end{align} The associated indicator function I_n = I(M_n>z) is a Bernoulli process with a success probability p(z)=1-(F(z))^n that depends on the magnitude z of the extreme event. The number of extreme events within n trials thus follows a binomial distribution and the number of trials until an event occurs follows a geometric distribution with expected value and standard deviation of the same order O(1/p(z)). In practice, we might not have the distribution function F but the Fisher‚ÄìTippett‚ÄìGnedenko theorem provides an asymptotic result. If there exist sequences of constants a_n>0 and b_n\\\\in \\\\mathbb R such that : \\\\Pr\\\\\\\\{(M_n-b_n)/a_n \\\\leq z\\\\\\\\} \\\\rightarrow G(z) as n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty then : G(z) \\\\propto \\\\exp \\\\left[-(1+\\\\zeta z)^{-1/\\\\zeta} \\\\right] where \\\\zeta depends on the tail shape of the distribution.

Also known as Type 2. In all cases, \\\\alpha>0.  Multivariate theory  Extreme value theory in more than one variable introduces additional issues that have to be addressed. One problem that arises is that one must specify what constitutes an extreme event. Although this is straightforward in the univariate case, there is no unambiguous way to do this in the multivariate case. The fundamental problem is that although it is possible to order a set of real-valued numbers, there is no natural way to order a set of vectors. As an example, in the univariate case, given a set of observations x_i it is straightforward to find the most extreme event simply by taking the maximum (or minimum) of the observations. However, in the bivariate case, given a set of observations (x_i, y_i) , it is not immediately clear how to find the most extreme event. Suppose that one has measured the values (3, 4) at a specific time and the values (5, 2) at a later time. Which of these events would be considered more extreme? There is no universal answer to this question. Another issue in the multivariate case is that the limiting model is not as fully prescribed as in the univariate case. In the univariate case, the model (GEV distribution) contains three parameters whose values are not predicted by the theory and must be obtained by fitting the distribution to the data. In the multivariate case, the model not only contains unknown parameters, but also a function whose exact form is not prescribed by the theory. However, this function must obey certain constraints. As an example of an application, bivariate extreme value theory has been applied to ocean research.

Iaido consists of four main components: the smooth, controlled movements of drawing the sword from its scabbard (or saya), striking or cutting an opponent, removing blood from the blade, and then replacing the sword in the scabbard.John Nauright, Charles Parrish, edited (2012) Sports Around the World: History, Culture, and Practice. ABC-CLIO. Page 226. While beginning practitioners of iaido may start learning with a wooden sword (bokken) depending on the teaching style of a particular instructor, most of the practitioners use the blunt edged sword, called iait≈ç.Armstrong, Hunter B (1995) The koryu Bujutsu Experience in Koryu Bujutsu - Classical Warrior Traditions of Japan (ed. by Diane Skoss).Koryu Books. Page 31. Few, more experienced, iaido practitioners use a sharp edged sword (shinken).. Practitioners of iaido are often referred to as iaidoka.Pellman, Leonard and Masayuki Shimabukuro (2008, 2nd edition) Flashing Steel: Mastering Eishin-Ryu Swordsmanship. Blue Snake Books.

Origins of the name Haruna Matsuo sensei (1925‚Äì2002) demonstrating Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu kata Ukenagashi The term \\"iaido\\" appears in 1932 and consists of the kanji characters (i), (ai), and (d≈ç)., p. 79.Draeger, Donn F. (1974) Modern Bujutsu & Budo - The Martial Arts and Ways of Japan. (Vol. III). New York: Weatherhill. Page 55-58. The origin of the first two characters, , is believed to come from saying , that can be roughly translated as \\"being constantly (prepared), match/meet (the opposition) immediately\\". Thus the primary emphasis in 'iai' is on the psychological state of being present (Â±Ö). The secondary emphasis is on drawing the sword and responding to the sudden attack as quickly as possible (Âêà). The last character, , is generally translated into English as the way. The term \\"iaido\\" approximately translates into English as \\"the way of mental presence and immediate reaction\\",Shaw, Scott (1999) Samurai Zen. Chapter 12. Weiser Books. and was popularized by Nakayama Hakudo. The term emerged from the general trend to replace the suffix (\\"the art of\\") with in Japanese martial arts in order to emphasize the philosophical or spiritual aspects of the practice.Draeger, Donn F. (1974) Modern bujutsu & Budo - The Martial Arts and Ways of Japan. (Vol. III). New York: Weatherhill. Page 55-58. Purpose Iaido encompasses hundreds of styles of swordsmanship, all of which subscribe to non-combative aims and purposes. Iaido is an intrinsic form of Japanese modern budo. Iaido is a reflection of the morals of the classical warrior and to build a spiritually harmonious person possessed of high intellect, sensitivity, and resolute will. Iaido is for the most part performed solo as an issue of kata, executing changed strategies against single or various fanciful rivals. Every kata starts and finishes with the sword sheathed. Notwithstanding sword method, it obliges creative ability and fixation to keep up the inclination of a genuine battle and to keep the kata new. Iaidoka are regularly prescribed to practice kendo to safeguard that battling feel; it is normal for high positioning kendoka to hold high rank in iaido and the other way around. To appropriately perform the kata, iaidoka likewise learn carriage and development , hold and swing. At times iaidoka will practice accomplice kata like kendo or kenjutsu kata. Dissimilar to kendo, iaido is never honed in a free-competing way. Moral and religious influences The metaphysical aspects in iaido have been influenced by several philosophical and religious directions. Iaido is a blend of the ethics of Confucianism, methods of Zen, the philosophical Taoism, the purificatory rites of Shintoism and aspects from bushido. Seitei-gata techniques Because iaido is practiced with a weapon, it is almost entirely practiced using solitary forms, or kata performed against one or more imaginary opponents. Multiple person kata exist within some schools of iaido; consequently, iaidoka usually use bokken for such kata practice. Iaido does include competition in form of kata but does not use sparring of any kind. Because of this non-fighting aspect, and iaido's emphasis on precise, controlled, fluid motion, it is sometimes referred to as \\"moving Zen.\\" Most of the styles and schools do not practice tameshigiri, cutting techniques. A part of iaido is nukitsuke.Suino, Nicklaus (2007) Strategy in Japanese Swordsmanship. Weatherhill. Page 38. This is a quick draw of the sword, accomplished by simultaneously drawing the sword from the saya and also moving the saya back in saya-biki.Craig, Darrell (1981) IAI The Art of Drawing the Sword. Tuttle Publishing. Page 64. History Iaido started in the mid-1500s. Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu (1542 - 1621) is generally acknowledged as the organizer of Iaido. There were many different Koryu (customary schools), however just a few remain practiced today. Just about every one of them additionally concentrate on more seasoned school created amid 16-seventeenth century, in the same way as Muso-Shinden-ryu, Hoki-ryu, Muso-Jikiden-Eishin-ryu, Shinto-Munen-ryu, Tamiya-ryu, Yagyu-Shinkage-ryu, Mugai-ryu, Sekiguchi-ryu, et cetera. After the collapse of the Japanese feudal system in 1868 the founders of the modern disciplines borrowed from the theory and the practice of classical disciplines as they had studied or practiced.Draeger Donn. F. (1974) Modern Bujutsu & Budo - The Martial Arts and Ways of Japan. New York/London: Weatherhill. Page 57. The founding in 1895 of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK) Â§ßÊó•Êú¨Ê≠¶Âæ≥‰ºö (lit. \\"Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society\\") in Kyoto, Japan.Dai Nippon Butoku Kai: Honbu, Kyoto, Japan (2012).

In 1932 DNBK officially approved and recognized the Japanese discipline, iaido;Dai Nippon Butoku Kai: History and philosophy (2012). Retrieved on November 13, 2013. this year was the first time the term iaido appeared in Japan. After this initiative the modern forms of swordsmanship is organised in several iaido organisations. During the post- war occupation of Japan, the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai and its affiliates were disbanded by the Allies of World War II in the period 1945‚Äì1950. However, in 1950, the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai was reestablished and the practice of the Japanese martial disciplines began again.Draeger Donn. F. (1974) Modern Bujutsu & Budo - The Martial Arts and Ways of Japan. New York/London: Weatherhill. Page 48-49. The (ZNIR) was founded in 1948. In 1952, the (IMAF) was founded in Tokyo, Japan.

MEDSPORTPRESS, 2011; 1(2); Vol. 2, page 50. and has seven divisions representing the various Japanese martial arts, including iaido.International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF) - Divisions Also in 1952, the All Japan Kendo Federation (ZNKR) was founded. Upon formation of various organizations overseeing martial arts, a problem of commonality appeared. Since members of the organization were drawn from various backgrounds, and had experience practicing different schools of iaido, there arose a need for a common set of kata, that would be known by all members of organization, and that could be used for fair grading of practitioner's skill. Two of the largest Japanese organizations, All Japan Kendo Federation (ZNKR) and All Japan Iaido Federation (ZNIR), each created their own representative set of kata for this purpose.

Kata under the respective iaido organizations =T≈çh≈ç Iaido= The All Japan Iaido Federation (ZNIR, Zen Nihon Iaido Renmei, founded 1948) has a set of five koryu iaido forms, called T≈çh≈ç, contributed from the five major schools whose teachers were involved in the creation of the organization. *Mus≈ç Jikiden Eishin-ry≈´ School founded during the late Muromachi period (c. 1590).

('Kiri- age') *Sui≈ç-ry≈´ School founded during the late Sengoku period (c. 1600). ('Shih≈ç-giri') *H≈çki-ry≈´ School founded during the late Muromachi period (c. 1590). ('Kissaki-gaeshi') =Seitei Iaido= Seitei or Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei Iaido (Âà∂ÂÆö) are technical forms based on seitei-gata, or standard forms of sword-drawing techniques, created by the Zen Nihon Kendo Renmei (All Japan Kendo Federation).. This standard set of iaido kata was created in 1969 by a committee formed by the All Japan Kendo Federation (AJKF, Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei or ZNKR). The twelve Seitei iaido forms (seitei-gata) are standardised for the tuition, promotion and propagation of iaido at the iaido clubs, that are members of the regional Kendo federations. All dojos, that are members of the regional Kendo federations teach this set. Since member federations of International Kendo Federation (FIK) uses seitei gata as a standard for their iaido exams and shiai, seitei iaido has become the most widely practised form of iaido in Japan and the rest of the world. Other organizations Single-style federations usually do not have a standardized \\"grading\\" set of kata, and use kata from their koryu curriculum for grading and demonstrations. Schools Iaido in the Czech Republic as demonstrated by Victor Cook Sensei Many iaido organisations promote sword technique from the seiza (sitting position) and refer to their art as iaido. One of the popular versions of these is the Mus≈ç Shinden-ry≈´ Â§¢ÊÉ≥Á•û‰ºùÊµÅ, an iaido system created by Nakayama Hakud≈ç (1872‚Äì1958) in 1932.. The Mus≈ç Shinden-ry≈´ is an interpretation of one of the Jinsuke-Eishin lines, called Shimomura-ha. The other line of Jinsuke- Eishin, called Tanimura-ha, was created by Got≈ç Magobei Masasuke (died 1898) and ≈åe Masamichi Shikei (1852‚Äì1927). It was ≈åe Masamichi Shikei who began formally referring to his iaido branch as the Mus≈ç Jikiden Eishin-ry≈´ ÁÑ°ÂèåÁõ¥‰ºùËã±‰ø°ÊµÅ during the Taish≈ç era (1912‚Äì1926).. US dojo emblem Another popular Iaido school is Toyama-ry≈´ (Êà∏Â±±ÊµÅ), which was established in 1925 in Japan. It was created by the Japanese army during World War II to create a simplified form. This style emphasizes the most important aspects of drawing and cutting. After the war it became obsolete, but was revived after 1952. Ranks Ranking in iaido depends on the school and/or the member federations to which a particular school belongs. Iaido as it is practiced by the International Kendo Federation (FIK) and All Japan Iaido Federation (ZNIR) uses the kyu-dan system, created in 1883.The Belt Ranking Game, May 1991. Page 64. Black Belt Magazine Modern kendo is almost entirely governed by the FIK, including the ranking system. Iaido is commonly associated with either the FIK or the ZNIR, although there are many extant kory≈´ which may potentially use the menkyo system of grading, or a different system entirely. Iaido as governed by the FIK establishes 10th dan as the maximum attainable rank, though there are no living 10th practitioners in Kendo, there still remains many in Iaido. While there are some living 9th dan practitioners of kendo, the All Japan Kendo Federation only currently awards up to 8th dan. Most other member federations of the FIK have followed suit, excluding Iaido. International Iaido Sport Competition Medals and cups are a part of iaido in connection with sport games. Iaido, in its modern form, is practiced as a competitive sport, regulated by the All Japan Kendo Federation. The AJKF maintains the standardized iaido kata and etiquette, and organizes competitions. An iaido competition consists of two iaidoka performing their kata next to each other and simultaneously. The competitors will be judged by a panel of judges according to the standardized regulations. European Kendo Federation has arranged iaido championships since 2000, and this competition is held every year.European Kendo Federation - Iaido Championships Organisations Many national and regional organisations manage and promote iaido activities. The following is a list of international organisations which include iaido: Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK), established in 1895 in Kyoto, approved and recognized the discipline iaido. The International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF) was established in Kyoto in 1952 and is dedicated to the promotion and development of the martial arts worldwide, including iaido. International Kendo Federation (FIK), established in 1970, an international organization for Kendo, Iaido and Jodo practitioners, which many national Kendo federations are a member of. All Japan Iaido Federation (or Zen Nippon Iaido Renmei) (ZNIR) was established in 1954 \\"in accordance with the Japanese bushido spirit to pass on the time-honoured system of Kobudo Iaido\\". The World Mus≈ç Jikiden Eishin-ry≈´ Iaido Federation, established in Tokyo in 2011, is dedicated to ensuring the orthodox transmission of MJER Iaido to future generations worldwide, as well as promoting and preserving the development of other schools. Zen Nihon Toyama Ryu Iaido Renmei (ZNTIR) established in Machida Japan after WW II was created as \\"Toyama-Ryu Shinko kai\\" established by Tokutomi Tasaburo and Nakamura Taizaburo who were Gunto Soho instructors at the Toyama Ryu Military Academy for the Japanese Imperial Army. Over time the \\"Toyama-Ryu Shinko-Kai\\" was renamed as Zen Nihon Toyama Ryu Iaido Renmei, and practice eight kata from a derivative of Gunto Soho.

The ‚Äîliterally \\"big-little\\"The Japanese sword, Kanzan Sat≈ç, Kodansha International, 1983 p.68‚Äîis a Japanese term for a matched pair of traditionally made Japanese swords (nihonto) worn by the samurai class in feudal Japan. Description The etymology of the word daish≈ç becomes apparent when the terms dait≈ç, meaning long sword, and sh≈çt≈ç, meaning short sword, are used; dait≈ç + sh≈çt≈ç = daish≈ç.The connoisseur's book of Japanese swords, K≈çkan Nagayama, Kodansha International, 1998 p.62 A daish≈ç is typically depicted as a katana and wakizashi (or a tant≈ç) mounted in matching koshirae, but originally the daish≈ç was the wearing of any long and short uchigatana together.The Japanese sword, Kanzan Sat≈ç, Kodansha International, 1983 The katana/wakizashi pairing is not the only daish≈ç combination as generally any longer sword paired with a tant≈ç is considered to be a daish≈ç. Daish≈ç eventually came to mean two swords having a matched set of fittings. A daish≈ç could also have matching blades made by the same swordsmith, but this was in fact uncommon and not necessary for two swords to be considered to be a daish≈ç, as it would have been more expensive for a samurai.Samurai: The Weapons and Spirit of the Japanese Warrior, Clive Sinclaire, Globe Pequot, 2004 p.53Classical weaponry of Japan: special weapons and tactics of the martial arts, Serge Mol, Kodansha International, 2003 p.18The Japanese sword, Kanzan Sat≈ç, Kodansha International, 1983 ‚Äì Antiques & Collectibles ‚Äì 210P.68Katana: The Samurai Sword: 950‚Äì1877, Stephen Turnbull, Osprey Publishing, 2010 P.20 History Edo-period daish≈ç koshirae on its stand. The long-sword is generally stored above the wakizashi, curving downwards. When hung for display, the tip points to the right. The concept of the daisho originated with the pairing of a short sword with whatever long sword was being worn during a particular time period. The tachi would be paired with a tant≈ç, and later the uchigatana would be paired with another shorter uchigatana. With the advent of the katana, the wakizashi eventually was chosen by samurai as the short sword over the tant≈ç. Kanzan Sat≈ç, in his book titled The Japanese Sword, notes that there did not seem to be any particular need for the wakizashi and suggests that the wakizashi may have become more popular than the tant≈ç as the wakizashi was more suited for indoor fighting. He mentions the custom of leaving the katana at the door of a castle or palace when entering while continuing to wear the wakizashi inside.The Japanese sword, Kanzan Sat≈ç, Kodansha International, 1983 P.68 Daish≈ç may have become popular around the end of the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573)Samurai: The Weapons and Spirit of the Japanese Warrior, Clive Sinclaire, Globe Pequot, 2004 p.53 as several early examples date from the late 16th century.The Japanese sword, Kanzan Sat≈ç, Kodansha International, 1983 p.68 & p.84 Wearing daish≈ç was limited to the samurai class after the sword hunt of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1588, and became a symbol of their rank.Samurai: The Weapons and Spirit of the Japanese Warrior, Clive Sinclaire, Globe Pequot, 2004 p.53 An edict in 1629 defining the duties of a samurai required that daish≈ç be worn when on official duty.Cutting Edge: Japanese Swords in the British Museum, Victor Harris, Tuttle Pub., 2005 p.26 According to most traditional kenjutsu schools, only one sword of the daisho would have been used in combat. However, in the first half of the 17th century, the famous swordsman Miyamoto Musashi promoted the use of a one-handed grip, which allowed both swords to be used simultaneously. This technique, called nit≈çken, is a main element of the Niten Ichi-ry≈´ style of swordsmanship that Musashi founded.Serge Mol, 2003, Classical Weaponry of Japan: Special Weapons and Tactics of the Martial Arts Kodansha International Ltd, (pp. 22‚Äì23) During the Meiji period an edict was passed in 1871 abolishing the requirement that daish≈ç be worn by samurai, and in 1876 wearing swords in public by most of Japan's population was banned; thus ended the use of the daish≈ç as the symbol of the samurai. The samurai class was abolished soon after the sword ban.Samurai: The Weapons and Spirit of the Japanese Warrior, Clive Sinclaire, Globe Pequot, 2004 p.58New directions in the study of Meiji Japan, Helen Hardacre, Adam L.

A symbol of the city, it is known for its density within the city limits, uniform architecture and unique entrances influenced by Art Nouveau. It is mostly underground and long. It has 302 stations, of which 62 have transfers between lines. The Montmartre funicular is considered to be part of the metro system, within which is represented by a 303rd fictive station \\"Funiculaire\\". There are 16 lines (with an additional four under construction), numbered 1 to 14 with two lines, 3bis and 7bis, which are named because they started out as branches of Line 3 and Line 7; later they officially became separate lines. Lines are identified on maps by number and colour, with the direction of travel indicated by the terminus. It is the second busiest metro system in Europe, after the Moscow Metro, as well as the tenth busiest in the world. It carried 1.520 billion passengers in 2015, 4.16 million passengers a day, which amounts to 20% of the overall traffic in Paris. It is one of the densest metro systems in the world, with 245 stations within the of the City of Paris. Ch√¢telet‚ÄìLes Halles, with five M√©tro lines, three RER commuter rail and platforms up to 800 metres apart, is one of the world's largest metro stations. However, the system has generally poor accessibility, because most stations were built well before this became a consideration. The first line opened without ceremony on 19 July 1900, during the World's Fair (Exposition Universelle). The system expanded quickly until the First World War and the core was complete by the 1920s. Extensions into suburbs and Line 11 were built in the 1930s. The network reached saturation after World War II with new trains to allow higher traffic, but further improvements have been limited by the design of the network and in particular the short distances between stations. Besides the M√©tro, central Paris and its urban area are served by the RER, developed beginning in the 1960s, several tramway lines, Transilien suburban trains and two VAL lines, serving Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport. In the late 1990s, the automated Line 14 was built to relieve RER A. A large expansion of the network is currently under construction - Grand Paris Express - new orbital Metro lines around the √éle-de-France region, outside Paris city limits.  Naming  M√©tro signage M√©tro is the abbreviated name of the company that originally operated most of the network: La Compagnie du chemin de fer m√©tropolitain de Paris (\\"The Paris Metropolitan Railway Company\\"), shortened to \\"Le M√©tropolitain\\". It was quickly abbreviated to m√©tro, which became a common word to designate all rapid transit systems in France and in many cities elsewhere (a genericized trademark). The M√©tro is operated by the R√©gie autonome des transports parisiens (RATP), a public transport authority that also operates part of the RER network, bus services, light rail lines and many bus routes. The name m√©tro was adopted in many languages, making it the most used word for a (generally underground) urban transit system. It is possible that \\"Compagnie du chemin de fer m√©tropolitain\\" was copied from the name of London's pioneering underground railway company, the Metropolitan Railway, which had been in business for almost 40 years prior to the inauguration of Paris's first line.  History  excavated in open sites and then covered. Bastille station at the beginning of the 20th century By 1845, Paris and the railway companies were already thinking about an urban railway system to link inner districts of the city. The railway companies and the French government wanted to extend main-line railways into a new underground network, whereas the Parisians favoured a new and independent network and feared national takeover of any system it built.Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p135 The disagreement lasted from 1856 to 1890. Meanwhile, the population became denser and traffic congestion grew massively. The deadlock put pressure on the authorities and gave the city the chance to enforce its vision. Prior to 1845, the urban transport network consisted primarily of a large number of omnibus lines, consolidated by the French government into a regulated system with fixed and unconflicting routes and schedules.Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p138-140 The first concrete proposal for an urban rail system in Paris was put forward by civil engineer Florence de K√©rizouet. This plan called for a surface cable car system.Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p141 In 1855, civil engineers Edouard Brame and Eug√®ne Flachat proposed an underground freight urban railroad, due to the high rate of accidents on surface rail lines. On 19 November 1871 the General Council of the Seine commissioned a team of 40 engineers to plan an urban rail network.Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p142 This team proposed a network with a pattern of routes \\"resembling a cross enclosed in a circle\\" with axial routes following large boulevards. On 11 May 1872 the Council endorsed the plan, but the French government turned down the plan. After this point, a serious debate occurred over whether the new system should consist of elevated lines or of mostly underground lines; this debate involved numerous parties in France, including Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant, and the Eiffel Society of Gustave Eiffel, and continued until 1892.Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p142-148 Eventually the underground option emerged as the preferred solution because of the high cost of buying land for rights-of-way in central Paris required for elevated lines, estimated at 70,000 francs per metre of line for a 20-metre- wide railroad.Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p148 The last remaining hurdle was the city's concern about national interference in its urban rail system. The city commissioned renowned engineer Jean-Baptiste Berlier, who designed Paris' postal network of pneumatic tubes, to design and plan its rail system in the early 1890s. Berlier recommended a special track gauge of (versus the standard gauge of ) to protect the system from national takeover, which inflamed the issue substantially.Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p148-9 The issue was finally settled when the Minister of Public Works begrudgingly recognized the city's right to build a local system on 22 November 1895, and by the city's secret designing of the trains and tunnels to be too narrow for main-line trains, while adopting standard gauge as a compromise with the state. = Fulgence Bienven√ºe project = Chevaleret station, 1903 Jaur√®s station On 20 April 1896, Paris adopted the Fulgence Bienven√ºe project, which was to serve only the city proper of Paris. Many Parisians worried that extending lines to industrial suburbs would reduce the safety of the city. Paris forbade lines to the inner suburbs and, as a guarantee, M√©tro trains were to run on the right, as opposed to existing suburban lines, which ran on the left. Unlike many other subway systems (such as that of London), this system was designed from the outset as a system of (initially) nine lines. Such a large project required a private-public arrangement right from the outset ‚Äì the city would build most of the permanent way, while a private concessionaire company would supply the trains and power stations, and lease the system (each line separately, for initially 39-year leases). In July 1897, six bidders competed, and The Compagnie Generale de Traction, owned by the Belgian Baron √âdouard Empain, won the contract; this company was then immediately reorganized as the Compagnie du Chemin de Fer M√©tropolitain. Construction began in November 1898. The first line, Porte Maillot‚ÄìPorte de Vincennes, was inaugurated on 19 July 1900 during the Paris World's Fair. Entrances to stations were designed in Art Nouveau style by Hector Guimard. Eighty-six of his entrances are still in existence. Bienven√ºe's project consisted of 10 lines, which correspond to current Line 1 to 9\\\\. Construction was so intense that by 1920, despite a few changes from schedule, most lines had been completed. The shield method of construction was rejected in favor of the cut-and-cover method in order to speed up work.Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p. 151. Bienven√ºe, a highly regarded engineer, designed a special procedure of building the tunnels to allow the swift repaving of roads, and is credited with a largely swift and relatively uneventful construction through the difficult and heterogeneous soils and rocks.Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p. 150-1,162 Line 1 and Line 4 were conceived as central east‚Äìwest and north‚Äìsouth lines. Two lines, ligne 2 Nord (Line 2 North) and ligne 2 Sud (Line 2 South), were also planned but Line 2 South was merged with Line 5 in 1906. Line 3 was an additional east‚Äìwest line to the north of line 1 and line 5 an additional north to south line to the east of Line 4\\\\. Line 6 would run from Nation to Place d'Italie. Lines 7, 8 and 9 would connect commercial and office districts around the Op√©ra to residential areas in the north-east and the south-west. Bienven√ºe also planned a circular line, the ligne circulaire int√©rieure, to connect the six main-line stations. A section opened in 1923 between Invalides and the Boulevard Saint-Germain before the plan was abandoned. = Nord-Sud competing network = A Nord-Sud station sign On 31 January 1904, a second concession was granted to the Soci√©t√© du chemin de fer √©lectrique souterrain Nord-Sud de Paris (Paris North- South underground electrical railway company), abbreviated to the Nord-Sud (North-South) company. It was responsible for building three proposed lines: * Line A would join Montmartre to Montparnasse as an additional north‚Äìsouth line to the west of Line 4. * Line B would serve the north-west of Paris by connecting Saint-Lazare station to Porte de Clichy and Porte de Saint-Ouen. * Line C would serve the south-west by connecting Montparnasse station to Porte de Vanves. The aim was to connect Line B with Line C, but the CMP renamed Line B as Line 13 and Line C as Line 14. Both were connected by the RATP as the current Line 13\\\\. Line A was inaugurated on 4 November 1910, after being postponed because of floods in January that year. Line B was inaugurated on 26 February 1911. Because of the high construction costs, the construction of line C was postponed. Nord-Sud and CMP used compatible trains that could be used on both networks, but CMP trains used 600 volts third rail, and NS ‚àí600 volts overhead wire and +600 volts third rail. This was necessary because of steep gradients on NS lines. NS distinguished itself from its competitor with the high-quality decoration of its stations, the trains' extreme comfort and pretty lighting. Nord-Sud did not become profitable and bankruptcy became unavoidable. By the end of 1930, the CMP bought Nord-Sud. Line A became Line 12 and Line B Line 13\\\\. Line C was built and renamed Line 14; that line was reorganised in 1937 with Lines 8 and 10. This partial line is now the south part of Line 13\\\\. The last Nord-Sud train set was decommissioned on 15 May 1972. = 1930‚Äì1950: first inner suburbs are reached = Paris M√©tro network in 1939 Bienven√ºe's project was nearly completed during the 1920s. Paris planned three new lines and extensions of most lines to the inner suburbs, despite the reluctance of Parisians. Bienven√ºe's inner circular line having been abandoned, the already-built portion between Duroc and Od√©on for the creation of a new east‚Äìwest line that became Line 10, extended west to Porte de Saint-Cloud and the inner suburbs of Boulogne. The line C planned by Nord- Sud between Montparnasse station and Porte de Vanves was built as Line 14 (different from present Line 14). It extended north in encompassing the already-built portion between Invalides and Duroc, initially planned as part of the inner circular. The over-busy Belleville funicular tramway would be replaced by a new line, Line 11, extended to Ch√¢telet. Lines 10, 11 and 14 were thus the three new lines envisaged under this plan. Most lines would be extended to the inner suburbs. The first to leave the city proper was Line 9, extended in 1934 to Boulogne-Billancourt; more followed in the 1930s. World War II forced authorities to abandon projects such as the extension of Line 4 and Line 12 to the northern suburbs. By 1949, eight lines had been extended: Line 1 to Neuilly-sur-Seine and Vincennes, Line 3 to Levallois-Perret, Line 5 to Pantin, Line 7 to Ivry-sur-Seine, Line 8 to Charenton, Line 9 to Boulogne- Billancourt, Line 11 to Les Lilas and Line 12 to Issy-les-Moulineaux. World War II had a massive impact on the M√©tro. Services were limited and many stations closed. The risk of bombing meant the service between Place d'Italie and √âtoile was transferred from Line 5 to Line 6, so that most of the elevated portions of the M√©tro would be on Line 6. As a result, Lines 2 and 6 now form a circle. Most stations were too shallow to be used as bomb shelters. The French Resistance used the tunnels to conduct swift assaults throughout Paris.Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p. 286. It took a long time to recover after liberation in 1944. Many stations had not reopened by the 1960s and some closed for good. On 23 March 1948, the CMP (the underground) and the STCRP (bus and tramways) merged to form the RATP, which still operates the M√©tro. = 1960‚Äì1990: development of the RER = The Viaduc d'Austerlitz, crossing the Seine, is used by Line 5 The network grew saturated during the 1950s. Outdated technology limited the number of trains, which led the RATP to stop extending lines and concentrate on modernisation. The MP 51 prototype was built, testing both rubber-tyred metro and basic automatic driving on the voie navette. The first replacements of the older Sprague trains began with experimental articulated trains and then with mainstream rubber-tyred metro MP 55 and MP 59, some of the latter still in service (Line 11). Thanks to newer trains and better signalling, trains ran more frequently. The population boomed from 1950 to 1980. Car ownership became more common and suburbs grew further from the centre of Paris. The main railway stations, termini of the suburban rail lines, were overcrowded during rush hour. The short distance between metro stations slowed the network and made it unprofitable to build extensions. The solution in the 1960s was to revive a project abandoned at the end of the 19th century: joining suburban lines to new underground portions in the city centre as the R√©seau Express R√©gional (regional express network; RER). Saint-Lazare station The RER plan initially included one east‚Äìwest line and two north‚Äìsouth lines. RATP bought two unprofitable SNCF lines‚Äîthe Ligne de Saint-Germain (westbound) and the Ligne de Vincennes (eastbound) with the intention of joining them and to serve multiple districts of central Paris with new underground stations. The new line created by this merger became Line A. The Ligne de Sceaux, which served the southern suburbs and was bought by the CMP in the 1930s, would be extended north to merge with a line of the SNCF and reach the new Charles de Gaulle Airport in Roissy. This became Line B. These new lines were inaugurated in 1977 and their wild success outperformed all the most optimistic forecasts to the extent that line A is the most used urban rail line in the world with nearly 300 million journeys a year. Because of the enormous cost of these two lines, the third planned line was abandoned and the authorities decided that later developments of the RER network would be more cheaply developed by the SNCF, alongside its continued management of other suburban lines. However, the RER developed by the SNCF would never match the success of the RATP's two RER lines. In 1979, the SNCF developed Line C by joining the suburban lines of the Gare d'Austerlitz and Gare d'Orsay, the latter being converted into a museum dedicated to impressionist paintings. During the 1980s, it developed Line D, which was the second line planned by the initial RER schedule, but serving Ch√¢telet instead of R√©publique to reduce costs. A huge M√©tro-RER hub was created at Ch√¢telet‚ÄìLes Halles, becoming one of the world's largest underground stations. The same project of the 1960s also decided to merge Line 13 and Line 14 to create a quick connection between Saint-Lazare and Montparnasse as a new north‚Äìsouth line. Distances between stations on the lengthened line 13 differ from that on other lines in order to make it more \\"express\\" and hence to extend it farther in the suburbs. The new Line 13 was inaugurated on 9 November 1976. = 1990‚Äì2010: Eole and M√©t√©or = Franklin D. Roosevelt station on Line 1 In October 1998, Line 14 was inaugurated. It was the first fully new M√©tro line in 63 years. Known during its conception as M√©t√©or (M√©tro Est-Ouest Rapide), it is one of the two fully automatic lines within the network along with Line 1. It was the first with platform screen doors to prevent suicides and accidents. It was conceived with extensions to the suburbs in mind, similar to the extensions of the line 13 built during the 1970s. As a result, most of the stations are at least a kilometre apart. Like the RER lines designed by the RATP, nearly all stations offer connections with multiple M√©tro lines. The line runs between Saint- Lazare and Olympiades. Lines 13 and 7 are the only two on the network to be split in branches. The RATP would like to get rid of those saturated branches in order to improve the network's efficiency. A project existed to attribute to line 14 one branch of each line, and to extend them further into the suburbs. This project was abandoned. In 1999, the RER Line E was inaugurated. Known during its conception as Eole (Est-Ouest Liaison Express), it is the fifth RER line. It terminates at Haussmann ‚Äì Saint-Lazare, but a new project, financed by EPAD, the public authority managing the La D√©fense business district, should extend it west to La D√©fense ‚Äì Grande Arche and the suburbs beyond. = 2010 and beyond: automation = Pointe du Lac station, opened in 2011 In work started in 2007 and completed in November 2011, Line 1 was converted to driverless operation. The line was operated with a combination of driver-operated trains and driver-less trains until the delivery of the last of its driver-less MP 05 trains in February 2013. The same conversion is on- going for Line 4, with an expected completion date in 2022. Several extensions to the suburbs opened in the last years. Line 8 was extended to Pointe du Lac in 2011, line 12 was extended to Aubervilliers in 2012 and line 4 was extended to Mairie de Montrouge in 2013. = Accidents and incidents = * 10 August 1903: Couronnes Disaster (fire), 84 killed. * July ‚Äì October 1995: Paris M√©tro bombings (terror attack), committed by Algerian extremists ‚Äì 8 killed and more than 100 injured. * 30 August 2000: an MF 67 train derailed due to excessive speed and unavailable automatic cruising at Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, 24 slightly injured. * 6 August 2005: fire broke out on a train at Simplon, injuring at least 19 people. Early reports blamed an electrical short circuit as the cause. * 29 July 2007: a fire started on a train between Varenne and Invalides. Fifteen people were injured.  Network  Paris M√©tro map Since the M√©tro was built to comprehensively serve the city inside its walls, the stations are very close: 548 metres apart on average, from 424 m on Line 4Jean Tricoire, Un si√®cle de m√©tro en 14 lignes, p. 188 to one kilometre on the newer line 14, meaning Paris is densely networked with stations.Jean Tricoire, op. cit., p. 330 The surrounding suburbs are served by later line extensions, thus traffic from one suburb to another must pass through the city. The slow average speed effectively prohibits service to the greater Paris area. The M√©tro is mostly underground ( of ). Above-ground sections consist of elevated railway viaducts within Paris (on Lines 1, 2, 5 and 6) and the suburban ends of Lines 1, 5, 8, and 13. The tunnels are relatively close to the surface due to the variable nature of the terrain, which complicates deep digging; exceptions include parts of Line 12 under the hill of Montmartre and line 2 under M√©nilmontant. The tunnels follow the twisting line of the streets above. During construction in 1900, a minimum radius of curvature of just 75 metres was imposed, but even this low standard was not adhered to at Bastille and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. Like the New York City Subway and in contrast with the London Underground the Paris M√©tro mostly uses two-way tunnels. As in most French m√©tro and tramway systems, trains drive on the right (SNCF trains run on the left track). The tracks are standard gauge (1.435 metres). Electric power is supplied by a third rail which carries 750 volts DC. The width of the carriages, 2.4 metres, is narrower than that of newer French systems (such as the 2.9 m carriages in Lyon, one of the widest in Europe)Clive Lamming, M√©tro insolite and trains on Lines 1, 4 and 14 have capacities of 600-700 passengers; this is as compared with 2,600 on the Alt√©o MI 2N trains of RER A. The City of Paris deliberately chose the narrow size of the Metro tunnels to prevent the running of main-line trains; the city of Paris and the French state had historically poor relations.Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p. 149. In contrast to many other historical metro systems (such as New York, Madrid, London, and Boston), all lines have tunnels and operate trains with the same dimensions. Five Paris M√©tro Lines (1, 4, 6, 11 and 14) run on a rubber tire system developed by the RATP in the 1950s, exported to the Montreal, Santiago, Mexico City and Lausanne metros. The number of cars in each train varies line by line from three to six; most have five, and eight is possible on Line 14. Two lines, 7 and 13, have branches at the end, and trains serve every station on each line except when they are closed for renovations. =Map= = Opening hours = The first train leaves each terminus at 5:30 a.m. On some lines additional trains start from an intermediate station. The last train, often called the \\"balai\\" (broom) because it sweeps up remaining passengers, arrives at the terminus at 1:15 a.m., except on Fridays (since 7 December 2007),Press statement from RATP 2 October 2007 Saturdays and on nights before a holiday, when the service ends at 2:15 a.m. On New Year's Eve, F√™te de la Musique, Nuit Blanche and other events, some stations on Lines 1, 4, 6, 9 and 14 remain open all night. = Tickets = Ticket \\"t+\\" Fares are sold at kiosks and at automated machines in the station foyer. Entrance to platforms is by automated gate, opened by smart cards and simple tickets. Gates return tickets for passengers to retain for the duration of the journey. There is normally no system to collect or check tickets at the end of the journey, and tickets can be inspected at any point. The exit from all stations is clearly marked as to the point beyond which possession of a ticket is no longer required. The standard ticket is ticket \\"t+\\". It is valid for a multi-transfer journey within one and a half hours from the first validation. It can be used on the M√©tro, buses and trams, and in zone 1 of the RER. It allows unlimited transfers between the same mode of transport (i.e. M√©tro to M√©tro, bus to bus and tram to tram), between bus and tram, and between metro and RER zone 1. When transferring between the Metro and the RER, it is necessary to retain the ticket. The RER requires a valid ticket for entry and exit, even for a transfer. It costs ‚Ç¨1.90 or ten (a carnet) for ‚Ç¨16.90 as of March 2020. Other fares use the Navigo card (the name being a portmanteau from the French terms navigation and Parigot, a nickname for Parisians), an RFID-based contactless smart card. Fares include: * daily (Mobilis; the Ticket Jeunes, for youth under 26 years on weekends and national holidays, is half the cost of a Mobilis pass); * weekly or monthly (the former Carte orange, sold as the weekly Navigo (\\"hebdo\\") and the monthly Navigo); * yearly (Navigo int√©grale, or Imagine R for students); * The (Paris Visite) travel card is available for one, two, three or five days, for zones 1‚Äì3 covering the centre of Paris, or zones 1‚Äì5 covering the whole of the network including the RER to the airports, Versailles and Disneyland Paris. It was conceived mainly for visitors and is available through RATP's distributors in the UK, Switzerland and Belgium. It may be a better deal to buy a weekly card (up to ‚Ç¨10 saving) but a weekly card runs from Monday to Monday (and is reset every Monday), whereas the Paris Visite card is valid for the number of days purchased. =Facilities= On 26 June 2012 it was announced that the M√©tro would get Wi-Fi in most stations. Access provided would be free, with a premium paid alternative offer proposed for a faster internet connection.Le Wi-Fi gratuit arrive dans le m√©tro parisien Technical specifications The M√©tro has of track and 302 stations, 62 connecting between lines.Statistiques Syndicat des transports d'√éle-de-France rapport 2005 (in French) states 297 stations + Olympiades + Les Agnettes + Les Courtilles These figures do not include the RER network. The average distance between stations is . Trains stop at all stations.On 1 January 2006, a test was done with few lines opening at night on main stops only. Lines do not share tracks, even at interchange (transfer) stations. Trains average with a maximum of on all but the automated driverless trains of Line 14, which average and reach . An average interstation trip takes 58 seconds. Trains travel on the right. The track is standard gauge but the loading gauge is smaller than the mainline SNCF network. Power is from a lateral third rail, 750 V DC, except on the rubber-tyred lines where the current is from guide bars. The loading gauge is small compared to those of newer metro systems (but comparable to that of early European metros), with capacities of between about 560 and 720 passengers per train on Lines 1‚Äì14. Many other metro systems (such as those of New York and London) adopted expanded tunnel dimensions for their newer lines (or used tunnels of multiple sizes almost from the outset, in the case of Boston), at the cost of operating incompatible fleets of rolling stock. Paris built all lines to the same dimensions as its original lines. Before the introduction of rubber-tire lines in the 1950s, this common shared size theoretically allowed any M√©tro rolling stock to operate on any line, but in practice each line was assigned a regular roster of trains. A feature is the use of rubber-tired trains on five lines: this technique was developed by RATP and entered service in 1951.Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p312 The technology was exported to many networks around the world (including Montreal, Mexico City and Santiago). Lines 1, 4, 6, 11 and 14 have special adaptations to accommodate rubber-tyred trains. Trains are composed of 3 to 6 cars depending on the line, the most common being 5 cars (Line 14 may have 8 cars in the future), but all trains on the same line have the same number of cars. The Metro is designed to provide local, point-to- point service in Paris proper and service into the city from some close suburbs. Stations within Paris are very close together to form a grid structure, ensuring that every point in the city is close to a metro station (less than ), but this makes the service slow , except on Line 14 where the stations are farther apart and the trains travel faster. The low speed virtually precludes feasible service to farther suburbs, which are serviced by the RER. The Paris M√©tro runs mostly underground; surface sections include sections on viaduct in Paris (Lines 1, 2, 5 and 6) and at the surface in the suburbs (Lines 1, 5, 8 and 13). In most cases both tracks are laid in a single tunnel. Almost all lines follow roads, having been built by the cut-and-cover method near the surface (the earliest by hand). Line 1 follows the straight course of the Champs-Elys√©es and on other lines some stations (Li√®ge, Commerce) have platforms that do not align: the street above is too narrow to fit both platforms opposite each other. Many lines have very sharp curves. The specifications established in 1900 required a very low minimum curve radius by railway standards, but even this was often not fully respected, for example near Bastille and Notre Dame de Lorette. Parts of the network are built at depth, in particular a section of Line 12 under Montmartre, the sections under the Seine, and all of Line 14. Lines 7 and 13 have two terminal branches.  Rolling stock  The rolling stock has steel-wheel (MF for mat√©riel fer) and rubber-tyred trains (MP for mat√©riel pneu). The different versions of each kind are specified by year of design.

Lines   Stations  Hector Guimard's original Art Nouveau entrance of the Paris M√©tro at Porte Dauphine station The typical station comprises two central tracks flanked by two four-metre wide platforms. About 50 stations, generally current or former termini, are exceptions; most have three tracks and two platforms (Porte d'Orl√©ans), or two tracks and a central platform (Porte Dauphine). Some stations are single-track, either due to difficult terrain (Saint-Georges), a narrow street above (Li√®ge) or track loops (√âglise d'Auteuil). Station length was originally 75 m. This was extended to 90 m on high-traffic lines (Line 1 and Line 4), with some stations at 105 m (the difference as yet unused). In general, stations were built near the surface by the cut-and-cover method, and are vaulted. Stations of the former Nord-Sud network (Line 12 and Line 13) have higher ceilings, due to the former presence of a ceiling catenary. There are exceptions to the rule of near-surface vaulting: * Stations particularly close to the surface, generally on Line 1 (Champs-Elys√©es‚ÄìCl√©menceau), have flat metal ceilings. * Elevated (above-street) stations, in particular on Line 2 and Line 6, are built in brick and covered by platform awnings (Line 2) or glass canopies (Line 6). * Stations on the newest sections (Line 14), built at depth, comprise 120 m platforms, high ceilings and double-width platforms. Since the trains on this line are driverless, the stations have platform screen doors. Platform screen doors have been introduced on Line 1 as well since the MP 05 trains have been functioning. Several ghost stations are no longer served by trains. One of the three platforms at Porte des Lilas station is on a currently unused section of track, often used as a backdrop in films. In 2018, the busiest stations were Saint-Lazare (46.7 millions of passengers), Gare du Nord (45.8), Gare de Lyon (36.9), Montparnasse ‚Äì Bienven√ºe (30.6), Gare de l'Est (21.4), Biblioth√®que Fran√ßois Mitterrand (18.8), R√©publique (18.3), Les Halles (17.5), La D√©fense (16.0) and Bastille (13.2). = Interior decoration = Entrance to a Metra commuter rail station in Chicago, designed in Art Nouveau style as a replica of a Paris M√©tro station Concourses are decorated in Art Nouveau style defined at the M√©tro's opening in 1900. The spirit of this aesthetic has generally been respected in renovations. Standard vaulted stations are lined by small white earthenware tiles, chosen because of the poor efficiency of early twentieth century electric lighting. From the outset walls have been used for advertising; posters in early stations are framed by coloured tiles with the name of the original operator (CMP or Nord Sud). Stations of the former Nord Sud (most of line 12 and parts of line 13) generally have more meticulous decoration. Station names are usually inscribed on metallic plaques in white letters on a blue background or in white tiles on a background of blue tiles. The first renovations took place after the Second World War, when the installation of fluorescent lighting revealed the poor state of the original tiling. Three main styles of redecoration followed in succession. * Between 1948 and 1967 the RATP installed standardised coloured metallic wall casings in 73 stations. * From the end of the 1960s a new style was rolled out in around 20 stations, known as Mouton-Duvernet after the first station concerned. The white tiles were replaced to a height of 2 m with non-bevelled tiles in various shades of orange. Intended to be warm and dynamic, the renovations proved unpopular. The decoration has been removed as part of the \\"Renouveau du m√©tro\\" programme. * From 1975 some stations were redecorated in the Motte style, which emphasised the original white tiling but brought touches of colour to light fixtures, seating and the walls of connecting tunnels. The subsequent Ou√Ø Dire style features audaciously shaped seats and light housings with complementary multi-coloured uplighting. A number of stations have original decorations to reflect the cultural significance of their locations. The first to receive this treatment was Louvre ‚Äì Rivoli on line 1, which contains copies of the masterpieces on display at the museum. Other notable examples include Bastille (line 1), Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s (line 4), Cluny ‚Äì La Sorbonne (line 10) and Arts et M√©tiers (line 11). = Exterior decoration = Passy station Line 6 train running on the Pont de Bir-Hakeim near the Eiffel Tower The original Art Nouveau entrances are iconic symbols of Paris. There are currently 83 of them. Designed by Hector Guimard in a style that caused some surprise and controversy in 1900, there are two main variants: * The most elaborate feature glass canopies. Two original canopies still exist, at Porte Dauphine and Abbesses (originally located at H√¥tel de Ville until moved in the 1970s). A replica of the canopy at Abbesses was installed at Ch√¢telet station at the intersection of Rue des Halles and Rue Sainte-Opportune. * A cast-iron balustrade decorated in plant-like motifs, accompanied by a \\"M√©tropolitain\\" sign supported by two orange globes atop ornate cast-iron supports in the form of plant stems.  Several of the iconic Guimard entrances have been given to other cities. The only original one on a metro station outside Paris is at Square-Victoria-OACI station in Montreal, as a monument to the collaboration of RATP engineers. Replicas cast from the original moulds have been given to the Lisbon Metro (Picoas station); the Mexico City Metro (Metro Bellas Artes, with a \\"Metro\\" sign), offered as a gift in return for a Huichol mural displayed at Palais Royal ‚Äì Mus√©e du Louvre; and Chicago Metra (Van Buren Street, at South Michigan Avenue and East Van Buren Street, with a \\"Metra\\" sign), given in 2001. The Moscow Metro has a Guimard entrance at Kievskaya station, donated by the RATP in 2006. There is an entrance on display at the Sculpture Garden in Downtown Washington, D.C. This does not lead to a metro station, it is just for pleasure. Similarly, The Museum of Modern Art has an original, restored Guimard entrance outdoors in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden.. Later stations and redecorations have brought increasingly simple styles to entrances. * Classical stone balustrades were chosen for some early stations in prestigious locations (Franklin D. Roosevelt, R√©publique). * Simpler metal balustrades accompany a \\"M√©tro\\" sign crowned by a spherical lamp in other early stations (Saint-Placide). * Minimalist stainless-steel balustrades (Havre-Caumartin) appeared from the 1970s and signposts with just an \\"M\\" have been the norm since the war (Olympiades, opened 2007). A handful of entrances have original architecture (Saint-Lazare), and a number are integrated into residential or standalone buildings (Pelleport).

Cultural significance  The M√©tro has a cultural significance that goes well beyond the City of Paris. The name M√©tropolitan (or M√©tro) has become a generic name for subways and urban underground railroads. The station entrance kiosks, designed by Hector Guimard, fostered Art Nouveau building style (once widely known as \\"le style M√©tro\\"),Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p155, 165 though, some French commentators criticized the Guimard station kiosks, including their green colour and sign lettering, as difficult to read.Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World's Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p155-6, 165 The success of rubber-tired lines led to their export to metro systems around the world, starting with the Montreal Metro.Bobrick, Benson.

The Japanese adopted rubber-tired metros (with their own technology and manufacturing firms) to systems in Kobe, Sapporo, and parts of Tokyo. The \\"rabbit of the subway\\" is an anthropomorphic rabbit visible on stickers on the doors of the trains since 1977 to advise passengers (especially children) of the risk of getting one's hands trapped when the doors are opening, as well as the risk of injury on escalators or becoming trapped in the closing doors. This rabbit is now a cultural icon in Paris similar to the \\"mind the gap\\" phrase in London.  See also   References  Notes Bibliography * Bindi, A., & Lefeuvre, D. (1990).

A privateer is a private person or ship that engages in maritime warfare under a commission of war. Since robbery under arms was a common aspect of seaborne trade, until the early 19th century all merchant ships carried arms. A sovereign or delegated authority issued commissions, also referred to as a letter of marque, during wartime. The commission empowered the holder to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war. This included attacking foreign vessels and taking them as prizes, and taking prize crews as prisoners for exchange. Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under prize law, with the proceeds divided by percentage between the privateer's sponsors, shipowners, captains and crew. A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission (i.e. the sovereign). Privateering allowed sovereigns to raise revenue for war by mobilizing privately owned armed ships and sailors to supplement state power. For participants, privateering provided the potential for a greater income and profit than obtainable as a merchant seafarer or fisher. However, this incentive increased the risk of privateers turning to piracy when war ended. The commission usually protected privateers from accusations of piracy but in practice, the historical legality and status of privateers could be vague. Depending on the specific sovereign and the time period, commissions might be issued hastily; privateers might take actions beyond what was authorized in the commission, including after its expiry. A privateer who continued raiding after the expiration of a commission or the signing of a peace treaty could face accusations of piracy. The risk of piracy and the emergence of the modern state system of centralised military control caused the decline of privateering by the end of the 19th century. Legal framework and relation to piracy The commission was the proof the privateer was not a pirate. It usually limited activity to one particular ship, and specified officers, for a specified period of time. Typically, the owners or captain would be required to post a performance bond. The commission also dictated the expected nationality of potential prize ships under the terms of the war. At sea, the privateer captain was obliged to produce the commission to a potential prize ship's captain as evidence of the legitimacy of their prize claim. If the nationality of a prize was not the enemy of the commissioning sovereign, the privateer could not claim the ship as a prize. Doing so would be an act of piracy. In British law, under the Offences at Sea Act 1536, piracy was an act of treason, or raiding a ship without a valid commission. By the late 17th century, the prosecution of privateers loyal to the usurped King James II for piracy began to shift the legal framework of piracy away from treason towards crime against property.Craze, Sarah. 'Prosecuting Privateers for Piracy: How Piracy Law Transitioned from Treason to a Crime against Property.' The International Journal of Maritime History 28, no. 4 (2016): 654-70. As a result, privateering commissions became a matter of national discretion. By the passing of the Piracy Act 1717, a privateer's allegiance to Britain overrode any allegiance to a sovereign providing the commission. This helped bring privateers under the legal jurisdiction of their home country in the event the privateer turned pirate. Other European countries followed suit. The shift from treason to property also justified the criminalisation of traditional sea-raiding activities of people Europeans wished to colonise. The legal framework around authorised sea-raiding was considerably murkier outside of Europe. Unfamiliarity with local forms of authority created difficulty determining who was legitimately sovereign on land and at sea, whether to accept their authority, or whether the opposing parties were, in fact, pirates. Mediterranean corsairs operated with a style of patriotic-religious authority that Europeans, and later Americans, found difficult to understand and accept. It did not help that many European privateers happily accepted commissions from the deys of Algiers, Tangiers and Tunis. The sultans of the Sulu archipelago (now present-day Philippines) held only a tenuous authority over the local Iranun communities of slave-raiders. The sultans created a carefully spun web of marital and political alliances in an attempt to control unauthorised raiding that would provoke war against them.Warren, James Francis. The Sulu Zone 1768-1898. Singapore: Singapore University Press, 1981. In Malay political systems, the legitimacy and strength of their Sultan's management of trade determined the extent he exerted control over the sea- raiding of his coastal people.Murray, Dian H. Pirates of the South China Coast. California, USA: Stanford University Press, 1987. Privateers were implicated in piracy for a number of complex reasons. For colonial authorities, successful privateers were skilled seafarers who brought in much- needed revenue, especially in newly settled colonial outposts.Zahedieh, Nuala. A Frugal Prudential and Hopeful Trade': Privateering in Jamaica, 1644-89.,' in Naval History, 1500-1680, edited by Jan Glete, The International Library of Essays on Military History, 145-68: Ashgate Publishing Limited: Hants, England, 2005. These skills and benefits often caused local authorities to overlook a privateer's shift into piracy when a war ended. The French Governor of Petit-Goave gave buccaneer Francois Grogniet blank privateering commissions, which Grogniet traded to Edward Davis for a spare ship so the two could continue raiding Spanish cities under a guise of legitimacy. New York Governors Jacob Leisler and Benjamin Fletcher were removed from office in part for their dealings with pirates such as Thomas Tew, to whom Fletcher had granted commissions to sail against the French, but who ignored his commission to raid Mughal shipping in the Red Sea instead. Some privateers faced prosecution for piracy. William Kidd accepted a commission from King William III of England to hunt pirates but was later hanged for piracy. He had been unable to produce the papers of the prizes he had captured to prove his innocence.Ritchie, Robert C. 'Captain Kidd and the War against the Pirates,' in, edited: Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1986. Privateering commissions were easy to obtain during wartime but when the war ended and sovereigns recalled the privateers, many refused to give up the lucrative business and turned to piracy. Boston minister Cotton Mather lamented after the execution of pirate John Quelch: \\"Yea, Since the Privateering Stroke, so easily degenerates into the Piratical; and the Privateering Trade, is usually carried on with so Unchristian a Temper, and proves an inlet unto so much Debauchery, and Iniquity, and Confusion, I believe, I shall have Good men Concur with me, in wishing, That Privateering may no more be practised, except there may appear more hopeful Circumstances to Encourage it.\\" Noted privateers Privateers who were considered legitimate by their governments include: * Francis Drake (England) * Miguel Enr√≠quez (Puerto Rico) * Pieter van der Does (Dutch Empire) * Amaro Pargo (Spanish Empire or Hispanic Monarchy) * Hayreddin Barbarossa (Ottoman Empire) * Robert Surcouf (France) * Lars Gathenhielm (Sweden) Ships Entrepreneurs converted many different types of vessels into privateers, including obsolete warships and refitted merchant ships. The investors would arm the vessels and recruit large crews, much larger than a merchantman or a naval vessel would carry, in order to crew the prizes they captured. Privateers generally cruised independently, but it was not unknown for them to form squadrons, or to co- operate with the regular navy. A number of privateers were part of the English fleet that opposed the Spanish Armada in 1588. Privateers generally avoided encounters with warships, as such encounters would be at best unprofitable. Still, such encounters did occur. For instance, in 1815 Chasseur encountered HMS St Lawrence, herself a former American privateer, mistaking her for a merchantman until too late; in this instance, however, the privateer prevailed. The United States used mixed squadrons of frigates and privateers in the American Revolutionary War. Following the French Revolution, French privateers became a menace to British and American shipping in the western Atlantic and the Caribbean, resulting in the Quasi-War, a brief conflict between France and the United States, fought largely at sea, and to the Royal Navy's procuring Bermuda sloops to combat the French privateers.Bermuda Gazette and Weekly Advertiser August 15, 1795 Overall history 16th-century trade routes prey to privateering: Spanish treasure fleets linking the Caribbean to Seville, Manila-Acapulco galleons started in 1568 (white) and rival Portuguese India Armadas of 1498‚Äì1640 (blue) In Europe, the practice of authorising sea-raiding dated to at least the 13th century but the word 'privateer' was coined sometime in the mid-17th century. A seaman who shipped on a naval vessel was paid a wage and provided with victuals but the mariner on a merchantman or privateer was paid with an agreed share of the takings. This proved to be a far more attractive financial prospect and caused privateering to flourish as a result. The increase in competition for crews on armed merchant vessels and privateers was due, in a large part, because of the chance for a considerable payoff. Privateers were a large part of the total military force at sea during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the first Anglo- Dutch War, English privateers attacked the trade on which the United Provinces entirely depended, capturing over 1,000 Dutch merchant ships. During the subsequent war with Spain, Spanish and Flemish privateers in the service of the Spanish Crown, including the Dunkirkers, captured 1,500 English merchant ships, helping to restore Dutch international trade. British trade, whether coastal, Atlantic, or Mediterranean, was also attacked by Dutch privateers and others in the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars. Piet Pieterszoon Hein was a brilliantly successful Dutch privateer who captured a Spanish treasure fleet. Magnus Heinason was another privateer who served the Dutch against the Spanish. While their and others' attacks brought home a great deal of money, they hardly dented the flow of gold and silver from Mexico to Spain. Privateering continued until 1856 when the Declaration of Paris, signed by all major European powers, stated that \\"Privateering is and remains abolished\\". The United States did not sign because a stronger amendment, protecting all private property from capture at sea, was not accepted. In the 19th century, many nations passed laws forbidding their nationals from accepting commissions as privateers for other nations. The last major power to flirt with privateering was Prussia in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, when Prussia announced the creation of a 'volunteer navy' of ships privately owned and manned and eligible for prize money. The only difference between this and privateering was that these volunteer ships were under the discipline of the regular navy. =England/Britain= In England, and later the United Kingdom, the ubiquity of wars and the island nation's reliance on maritime trade enabled the use of privateers to great effect. England also suffered much from other nations' privateering. During the 15th century, the country \\"lacked an institutional structure and coordinated finance\\".Loades, D. M.

Woodbridge: Boydell, 2009. p. 113 Elizabeth's authorisation of sea-raiders (known as Sea Dogs) such as Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh allowed her to distance herself from their raiding activity while enjoying the benefits of their plunder. English ships cruised in the Caribbean and off the coast of Spain, trying to intercept treasure fleets from the Spanish Main. Elizabeth was succeeded by the first Stuart monarchs, James I and Charles I, who did not permit privateering. Desperate to fund the expensive War of Spanish Succession, Queen Anne restarted privateering and even removed the need for a sovereign's percentage as an incentive. Sovereigns continued to license British privateers throughout the century, although there were a number of unilateral and bilateral declarations limiting privateering between 1785 and 1823. This helped establish the privateer's persona as heroic patriots. British privateers last appeared en masse in the Napoleonic Wars.McCarthy, Matthew. Privateering, Piracy and British Policy in Spanish America 1810-1830. Woodbridge, UK: Boydell Press, 2013. Woodes Rogers' men search Spanish ladies for their jewels in Guayaquil, 1709 England and Scotland practiced privateering both separately and together after they united to create the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. It was a way to gain for themselves some of the wealth the Spanish and Portuguese were taking from the New World before beginning their own trans-Atlantic settlement, and a way to assert naval power before a strong Royal Navy emerged. Sir Andrew Barton, Lord High Admiral of Scotland, followed the example of his father, who had been issued with letters of marque by James III of Scotland to prey upon English and Portuguese shipping in 1485; the letters in due course were reissued to the son. Barton was killed following an encounter with the English in 1511. Sir Francis Drake, who had close contact with the sovereign, was responsible for some damage to Spanish shipping, as well as attacks on Spanish settlements in the Americas in the 16th century. He participated in the successful English defence against the Spanish Armada in 1588, though he was also partly responsible for the failure of the English Armada against Spain in 1589. Sir George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, was a successful privateer against Spanish shipping in the Caribbean. He is also famous for his short-lived 1598 capture of Fort San Felipe del Morro, the citadel protecting San Juan, Puerto Rico. He arrived in Puerto Rico on June 15, 1598, but by November of that year, Clifford and his men had fled the island due to fierce civilian resistance. He gained sufficient prestige from his naval exploits to be named the official Champion of Queen Elizabeth I. Clifford became extremely wealthy through his buccaneering but lost most of his money gambling on horse races. An action between an English ship and vessels of the Barbary corsairs Captain Christopher Newport led more attacks on Spanish shipping and settlements than any other English privateer. As a young man, Newport sailed with Sir Francis Drake in the attack on the Spanish fleet at Cadiz and participated in England's defeat of the Spanish Armada. During the war with Spain, Newport seized fortunes of Spanish and Portuguese treasure in fierce sea battles in the West Indies as a privateer for Queen Elizabeth I. He lost an arm whilst capturing a Spanish ship during an expedition in 1590, but despite this, he continued on privateering, successfully blockading Western Cuba the following year. In 1592, Newport captured the Portuguese carrack Madre de Deus (Mother of God), valued at ¬£500,000. Sir Henry Morgan was a successful privateer. Operating out of Jamaica, he carried on a war against Spanish interests in the region, often using cunning tactics. His operation was prone to cruelty against those he captured, including torture to gain information about booty, and in one case using priests as human shields. Despite reproaches for some of his excesses, he was generally protected by Sir Thomas Modyford, the governor of Jamaica. He took an enormous amount of booty, as well as landing his privateers ashore and attacking land fortifications, including the sack of the city of Panama with only 1,400 crew. Other British privateers of note include Fortunatus Wright, Edward Collier, Sir John Hawkins, his son Sir Richard Hawkins, Michael Geare, and Sir Christopher Myngs. Notable British colonial privateers in Nova Scotia include Alexander Godfrey of the brig Rover and Joseph Barss of the schooner Liverpool Packet. The latter schooner captured over 50 American vessels during the War of 1812. = Bermudians = The English colony of Bermuda (or the Somers Isles), settled accidentally in 1609, was used as a base for English privateers from the time it officially became part of the territory of the Virginia Company in 1612, especially by ships belonging to the Earl of Warwick, for whom Bermuda's Warwick Parish is named (the Warwick name had long been associated with commerce raiding, as exampled by the Newport Ship, thought to have been taken from the Spanish by Warwick the Kingmaker in the 15th Century). Many Bermudians were employed as crew aboard privateers throughout the century, although the colony was primarily devoted to farming cash crops until turning from its failed agricultural economy to the sea after the 1684 dissolution of the Somers Isles Company (a spin-off of the Virginia Company which had overseen the colony since 1615). With a total area of and lacking any natural resources other than the Bermuda cedar, the colonists applied themselves fully to the maritime trades, developing the speedy Bermuda sloop, which was well suited both to commerce and to commerce raiding. Bermudian merchant vessels turned to privateering at every opportunity in the 18th century, preying on the shipping of Spain, France, and other nations during a series of wars, including the 1688 to 1697 Nine Years' War (King William's War); the 1702 to 1713 Queen Anne's War;\\"Cedar on the Reef\\", ScholarShip.

Fifteen privateers operated from Bermuda during the war, but losses exceeded captures); the 1775 to 1783 American War of Independence; and the 1796 to 1808 Anglo-Spanish War.\\"In the Eye of All Trade: Bermuda, Bermudians, and the Maritime Atlantic World, 1680‚Äì1783\\", by Michael Jarvis, University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 2010\\"Bermuda's Sailors of Fortune\\", by Sister Jean de Chantal Kennedy. Bermuda Historical Society, 1st January, 1963. ASIN: B0007J8WMW By the middle of the 18th century, Bermuda was sending twice as many privateers to sea as any of the continental colonies. They typically left Bermuda with very large crews. This advantage in manpower was vital in overpowering the crews of larger vessels, which themselves often lacked sufficient crewmembers to put up a strong defence. The extra crewmen were also useful as prize crews for returning captured vessels. The Bahamas, which had been depopulated of its indigenous inhabitants by the Spanish, had been settled by England, beginning with the Eleutheran Adventurers, dissident Puritans driven out of Bermuda during the English Civil War. Spanish and French attacks destroyed New Providence in 1703, creating a stronghold for pirates, and it became a thorn in the side of British merchant trade through the area. In 1718, Britain appointed Woodes Rogers as Governor of the Bahamas, and sent him at the head of a force to reclaim the settlement. Before his arrival, however, the pirates had been forced to surrender by a force of Bermudian privateers who had been issued letters of marque by the Governor of Bermuda. Bermuda Gazette of 12 November 1796, calling for privateering against Spain and its allies during the 1796 to 1808 Anglo-Spanish War, and with advertisements for crew for two privateer vessels. Bermuda was in de facto control of the Turks Islands, with their lucrative salt industry, from the late 17th century to the early 19th. The Bahamas made perpetual attempts to claim the Turks for itself. On several occasions, this involved seizing the vessels of Bermudian salt traders. A virtual state of war was said to exist between Bermudian and Bahamian vessels for much of the 18th century. When the Bermudian sloop Seaflower was seized by the Bahamians in 1701, the response of the Governor of Bermuda, Captain Benjamin Bennett, was to issue letters of marque to Bermudian vessels. In 1706, Spanish and French forces ousted the Bermudians but were driven out themselves three years later by the Bermudian privateer Captain Lewis Middleton. His ship, the Rose, attacked a Spanish and a French privateer holding a captive English vessel. Defeating the two enemy vessels, the Rose then cleared out the thirty-man garrison left by the Spanish and French.Maritimes: The Magazine of the Bermuda Maritime Museum. 2002. Vol. 15, No. 2. \\"Foreign Interlopers at Bermuda's Turks Islands\\", by Dr. Bill Cooke. Despite strong sentiments in support of the rebels, especially in the early stages, Bermudian privateers turned as aggressively on American shipping during the American War of Independence. The importance of privateering to the Bermudian economy had been increased not only by the loss of most of Bermuda's continental trade but also by the Palliser Act, which forbade Bermudian vessels from fishing the Grand Banks. Bermudian trade with the rebellious American colonies actually carried on throughout the war. Some historians credit the large number of Bermuda sloops (reckoned at over a thousand) built- in Bermuda as privateers and sold illegally to the Americans as enabling the rebellious colonies to win their independence. Also, the Americans were dependent on Turks salt, and one hundred barrels of gunpowder were stolen from a Bermudian magazine and supplied to the rebels as orchestrated by Colonel Henry Tucker and Benjamin Franklin, and as requested by George Washington, in exchange for which the Continental Congress authorised the sale of supplies to Bermuda, which was dependent on American produce. The realities of this interdependence did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm with which Bermudian privateers turned on their erstwhile countrymen. An American naval captain, ordered to take his ship out of Boston Harbor to eliminate a pair of Bermudian privateering vessels that had been picking off vessels missed by the Royal Navy, returned frustrated, saying, \\"the Bermudians sailed their ships two feet for every one of ours\\".Bermudiana, by Ronald John Williams. Rinehart & Company, Inc., 1946. Around 10,000 Bermudians emigrated in the years prior to American independence, mostly to the American colonies. Many Bermudians occupied prominent positions in American seaports, from where they continued their maritime trades (Bermudian merchants controlled much of the trade through ports like Charleston, South Carolina, and Bermudian shipbuilders influenced the development of American vessels, like the Chesapeake Bay schooner),\\"Tidewater Triumph: The Development and Worldwide Success of the Chesapeake Bay Pilot Schooner\\", by Geoffrey Footner.

Harris, The Bermuda Maritime Museum Press, The Bermuda Maritime Museum, captaining two sloops (the Fair American and the Experiment, respectively), carried out the only attack on Bermuda during the war. The target was a fort that guarded a little used passage through the encompassing reef line. After the soldiers manning the fort were forced to abandon it, they spiked its guns and fled themselves before reinforcements could arrive. A Bermuda sloop engaged as a privateer. When the Americans captured the Bermudian privateer Regulator, they discovered that virtually all of her crew were black slaves. Authorities in Boston offered these men their freedom, but all 70 elected to be treated as prisoners of war. Sent as such to New York on the sloop Duxbury, they seized the vessel and sailed it back to Bermuda. The War of 1812 saw an encore of Bermudian privateering, which had died out after the 1790s. The decline of Bermudian privateering was due partly to the buildup of the naval base in Bermuda, which reduced the Admiralty's reliance on privateers in the western Atlantic, and partly to successful American legal suits and claims for damages pressed against British privateers, a large portion of which were aimed squarely at the Bermudians.Bermuda From Sail To Steam: The History Of The Island From 1784 to 1901, Dr. Henry Wilkinson, Oxford University Press, During the course of the War of 1812, Bermudian privateers captured 298 ships, some 19% of the 1,593 vessels captured by British naval and privateering vessels between the Great Lakes and the West Indies.The Andrew and the Onions: The Story Of The Royal Navy In Bermuda, 1795‚Äì1975, Lt.

Among the better known (native-born and immigrant) Bermudian privateers were Hezekiah Frith, Bridger Goodrich,\\"The Prince of Privateers: Bridger Goodrich and His Family in America, Bermuda and Britain: 1775 ‚Äì 1825\\", by Nick Hartley.

The Bermudian magazine, Winter 2010 and Thomas Tew. = Providence Island colony = Bermudians were also involved in privateering from the short-lived English colony on Isla de Providencia, off the coast of Nicaragua. This colony was initially settled largely via Bermuda, with about eighty Bermudians moved to Providence in 1631. Although it was intended that the colony be used to grow cash crops, its location in the heart of the Spanish controlled territory ensured that it quickly became a base for privateering. Bermuda-based privateer Daniel Elfrith, while on a privateering expedition with Captain Sussex Camock of the bark Somer Ilands (a rendering of \\" Somers Isles\\", the alternate name of the Islands of Bermuda) in 1625, discovered two islands off the coast of Nicaragua, apart from each other. Camock stayed with 30 of his men to explore one of the islands, San Andr√©s, while Elfrith took the Warwicke back to Bermuda bringing news of Providence Island. Bermuda Governor Bell wrote on behalf of Elfrith to Sir Nathaniel Rich, a businessman and cousin of the Earl of Warwick (the namesake of Warwick Parish), who presented a proposal for colonizing the island noting its strategic location \\"lying in the heart of the Indies & the mouth of the Spaniards\\". Elfrith was appointed admiral of the colony's military forces in 1631, remaining the overall military commander for over seven years. During this time, Elfrith served as a guide to other privateers and sea captains arriving in the Caribbean. Elfrith invited the well-known privateer Diego el Mulato to the island. Samuel Axe, one of the military leaders, also accepted letters of marque from the Dutch authorizing privateering. The Spanish did not hear of the Providence Island colony until 1635 when they captured some Englishmen in Portobelo, on the Isthmus of Panama. Francisco de Murga, Governor and Captain-General of Cartagena, dispatched Captain Gregorio de Castellar y Mantilla and engineer Juan de Somovilla Texada to destroy the colony. The Spanish were repelled and forced to retreat \\"in haste and disorder\\". After the attack, King Charles I of England issued letters of marque to the Providence Island Company on 21 December 1635 authorizing raids on the Spanish in retaliation for a raid that had destroyed the English colony on Tortuga earlier in 1635 (Tortuga had come under the protection of the Providence Island Company. In 1635 a Spanish fleet raided Tortuga. 195 colonists were hung and 39 prisoners and 30 slaves were captured). The company could in turn issue letters of marque to subcontracting privateers who used the island as a base, for a fee. This soon became an important source of profit. Thus the company made an agreement with the merchant Maurice Thompson under which Thompson could use the island as a base in return for 20% of the booty. In March 1636 the Company dispatched Captain Robert Hunt on the Blessing to assume the governorship of what was now viewed as a base for privateering. Depredations continued, leading to growing tension between England and Spain, which were still technically at peace. On 11 July 1640, the Spanish Ambassador in London complained again, saying he Nathaniel Butler, formerly Governor of Bermuda, was the last full governor of Providence Island, replacing Robert Hunt in 1638. Butler returned to England in 1640, satisfied that the fortifications were adequate, deputizing the governorship to Captain Andrew Carter. In 1640, don Melchor de Aguilera, Governor and Captain-General of Cartagena, resolved to remove the intolerable infestation of pirates on the island. Taking advantage of having infantry from Castile and Portugal wintering in his port, he dispatched six hundred armed Spaniards from the fleet and the presidio, and two hundred black and mulatto militiamen under the leadership of don Antonio Maldonado y Tejada, his Sergeant Major, in six small frigates and a galleon. The troops were landed on the island, and a fierce fight ensued. The Spanish were forced to withdraw when a gale blew up and threatened their ships. Carter had the Spanish prisoners executed. When the Puritan leaders protested against this brutality, Carter sent four of them home in chains. The Spanish acted decisively to avenge their defeat. General Francisco D√≠az Pimienta was given orders by King Philip IV of Spain, and sailed from Cartagena to Providence with seven large ships, four pinnaces, 1,400 soldiers and 600 seamen, arriving on 19 May 1641. At first, Pimienta planned to attack the poorly defended east side, and the English rushed there to improvise defenses. With the winds against him, Pimienta changed plans and made for the main New Westminster harbor and launched his attack on 24 May. He held back his large ships to avoid damage, and used the pinnaces to attack the forts. The Spanish troops quickly gained control, and once the forts saw the Spanish flag flying over the governor's house, they began negotiations for surrender. On 25 May 1641, Pimienta formally took possession and celebrated mass in the church. The Spanish took sixty guns, and captured the 350 settlers who remained on the island ‚Äì others had escaped to the Mosquito Coast. They took the prisoners to Cartagena. The women and children were given a passage back to England. The Spanish found gold, indigo, cochineal and six hundred black slaves on the island, worth a total of 500,000 ducats, some of the accumulated booty from the English raids. Rather than destroy the defenses, as instructed, Pimienta left a small garrison of 150 men to hold the island and prevent occupation by the Dutch. Later that year, Captain John Humphrey, who had been chosen to succeed Captain Butler as governor, arrived with a large group of dissatisfied settlers from New England. He found the Spanish in occupation. Pimienta's decision to occupy the island was approved in 1643 and he was made a knight of the Order of Santiago. =Spain and its colonies= Amaro Pargo was one of the most famous corsairs of the Golden Age of Piracy. Miguel Enr√≠quez. When Spain issued a decree blocking foreign countries from trading, selling or buying merchandise in its Caribbean colonies, the entire region became engulfed in a power struggle among the naval superpowers. The newly independent United States later became involved in this scenario, complicating the conflict. As a consequence, Spain increased the issuing of privateering contracts. These contracts allowed an income option to the inhabitants of these colonies that were not related to the Spanish conquistadores. The most well-known privateer corsairs of the eighteenth century in the Spanish colonies were Miguel Enr√≠quez of Puerto Rico and Jos√© Campuzano-Polanco of Santo Domingo. Miguel Enr√≠quez was a Puerto Rican mulatto who abandoned his work as a shoemaker to work as a privateer. Such was the success of Enr√≠quez, that he became one of the wealthiest men in the New World. His fleet was composed of approx. 300 different ships during a career that spanned 35 years, becoming a military asset and reportedly outperforming the efficiency of the Armada de Barlovento. Enr√≠quez was knighted and received the title of Don from Philip V, something unheard of due to his ethnic and social background. One of the most famous privateers from Spain was Amaro Pargo. = France = Advertising for the auction of the prize Chelmers of London, brig captured by the French privateer Junon in 1810. Corsairs (French: corsaire) were privateers, authorized to conduct raids on shipping of a nation at war with France, on behalf of the French Crown. Seized vessels and cargo were sold at auction, with the corsair captain entitled to a portion of the proceeds. Although not French Navy personnel, corsairs were considered legitimate combatants in France (and allied nations), provided the commanding officer of the vessel was in possession of a valid Letter of Marque (fr. Lettre de Marque or Lettre de Course), and the officers and crew conducted themselves according to contemporary admiralty law. By acting on behalf of the French Crown, if captured by the enemy, they could claim treatment as prisoners of war, instead of being considered pirates. Because corsairs gained a swashbuckling reputation, the word \\"corsair\\" is also used generically as a more romantic or flamboyant way of referring to privateers, or even to pirates. The Barbary pirates of North Africa as well as Ottomans were sometimes called \\"Turkish corsairs\\". = Malta = Corsairing () was an important aspect of Malta's economy when the island was ruled by the Order of St. John, although the practice had begun earlier. Corsairs sailed on privately owned ships on behalf of the Grand Master of the Order, and were authorized to attack Muslim ships, usually merchant ships from the Ottoman Empire. The corsairs included knights of the Order, native Maltese people, as well as foreigners. When they captured a ship, the goods were sold and the crew and passengers were ransomed or enslaved, and the Order took a percentage of the value of the booty. Corsairing remained common until the end of the 18th century. = United States = Chasseur, one of the most famous American privateers of the War of 1812, capturing During King George's War, approximately 36,000 Americans served aboard privateers at one time or another. During the Nine Years War, the French adopted a policy of strongly encouraging privateers, including the famous Jean Bart, to attack English and Dutch shipping. England lost roughly 4,000 merchant ships during the war.Privateering and the Private Production of Naval Power, Gary M. Anderson and Adam Gifford Jr. In the following War of Spanish Succession, privateer attacks continued, Britain losing 3,250 merchant ships.Brewer, John. The Sinews of Power: War, Money, and the English State, 1688‚Äì1783. New York.: Alfred A. Knopf, 1989. p. 197 Parliament passed an updated Cruisers and Convoys Act in 1708 allocating regular warships to the defence of trade. In the subsequent conflict, the War of Austrian Succession, the Royal Navy was able to concentrate more on defending British ships. Britain lost 3,238 merchantmen, a smaller fraction of her merchant marine than the enemy losses of 3,434. While French losses were proportionally severe, the smaller but better protected Spanish trade suffered the least and it was Spanish privateers who enjoyed much of the best-allied plunder of British trade, particularly in the West Indies. During the American Civil War privateering took on several forms, including blockade running while privateering, in general, occurred in the interests of both the North and the South. Letters of marque would often be issued to private shipping companies and other private owners of ships, authorizing them to engage vessels deemed to be unfriendly to the issuing government. Crews of ships were awarded the cargo and other prizes aboard any captured vessel as an incentive to search far and wide for ships attempting to supply the Confederacy, or aid the Union, as the case may be.  American Revolutionary War  During the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress, and some state governments (on their own initiative), issued privateering licenses, authorizing \\"legal piracy\\", to merchant captains in an effort to take prizes from the British Navy and Tory (Loyalist) privateers. This was done due to the relatively small number of commissioned American naval vessels and the pressing need for prisoner exchange.Naval battle off Halifax, Nova Scotia About 55,000 American seamen served aboard the privateers. They quickly sold their prizes, dividing their profits with the financier (persons or company) and the state (colony). Long Island Sound became a hornets' nest of privateering activity during the American Revolution (1775‚Äì1783), as most transports to and from New York went through the Sound. New London, Connecticut was a chief privateering port for the American colonies, leading to the British Navy blockading it in 1778‚Äì1779. Chief financiers of privateering included Thomas & Nathaniel Shaw of New London and John McCurdy of Lyme. In the months before the British raid on New London and Groton, a New London privateer took Hannah in what is regarded as the largest prize taken by any American privateer during the war. Retribution was likely part of Gov. Clinton's (NY) motivation for Arnold's Raid, as the Hannah had carried many of his most cherished items. American privateers are thought to have seized up to 300 British ships during the war. The British ship Jack was captured and turned into an American privateer, only to be captured again by the British in the naval battle off Halifax, Nova Scotia. American privateers not only fought naval battles but also raided numerous communities in British colonies, such as the Raid on Lunenburg, Nova Scotia (1782). The United States Constitution authorized the U.S. Congress to grant letters of marque and reprisal. Between the end of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, less than 30 years, Britain, France, Naples, the Barbary States, Spain, and the Netherlands seized approximately 2,500 American ships.US Navy Fleet List War of 1812 Payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20% of United States government annual revenues in 1800 and would lead the United States to fight the Barbary states in the First Barbary War and Second Barbary Wars.  War of 1812  During the War of 1812, both the British and the American governments used privateers, and the established system was very similar.Tabarrok, Alexander (Winter 2007). \\"The Rise, Fall, and Rise Again of Privateers\\".

Overall some 200 of the ships took prizes. The cost of buying and fitting of a large privateer was about $40,000 and prizes could net $100,000. Captain Thomas Boyle was one of the famous and successful American privateers. He commanded the Baltimore schooner Comet and then later in the war the Baltimore clipper Chasseur. He captured over 50 British merchant ships during the war. One source estimated a total damage to the Royal Navy from Chasseur's 1813-1815 activities at one and a half million dollars. In total, the Baltimore privateer fleet of 122 ships sunk or seized 500 British ships with an estimated value of $16 million, which accounts about one-third of all the value of all prizes taken over the course of the whole war. James De WolfOn April 8, 1814, the British attacked Essex, Connecticut, and burned the ships in the harbor, due to the construction there of a number of privateers. This was the greatest financial loss of the entire War of 1812 suffered by the Americans. However, the private fleet of James De Wolf, which sailed under the flag of the American government in 1812, was most likely a key factor in the naval campaign of the war. De Wolf's ship, the Yankee, was possibly the most financially successful ship of the war. Privateers proved to be far more successful than their US Navy counterparts, claiming three-quarters of the 1600 British merchant ships taken during the war (although a third of these were recaptured prior to making landfall). One of the more successful of these ships was the Prince de Neufchatel, which once captured nine British prizes in swift succession in the English Channel. Jean Lafitte and his privateers aided US General Andrew Jackson in the defeat of the British in the Battle of New Orleans in order to receive full pardons for their previous crimes.Ramsay (1996), p. 62.Ramsay (1996), p. 69.Ramsay (1996), p. 70.Ramsay (1996), p. 71.Ramsay (1996), p. 77. Jackson formally requested clemency for Lafitte and the men who had served under him, and the US government granted them all a full pardon on February 6, 1815.Ramsay (1996), p. 82.Ingersoll (1852) pp. 82‚Äì83 However, many of the ships captured by the Americans were recaptured by the Royal Navy. British convoy systems honed during the Napoleonic Wars limited losses to singleton ships, and the effective blockade of American and continental ports prevented captured ships being taken in for sale. This ultimately led to orders forbidding US privateers from attempting to bring their prizes in to port, with captured ships instead having to be burnt. Over 200 American privateer ships were captured by the Royal Navy, many of which were turned on their former owners and used by the British blockading forces. Nonetheless, during the War of 1812 the privateers \\"swept out from America‚Äôs coasts, capturing and sinking as many as 2,500 British ships and doing approximately $40 million worth of damage to the British economy.\\"  1856 Declaration of Paris  The US was not one of the initial signatories of the 1856 Declaration of Paris which outlawed privateering, and the Confederate Constitution authorized use of privateers. However, the US did offer to adopt the terms of the Declaration during the American Civil War, when the Confederates sent several privateers to sea before putting their main effort in the more effective commissioned raiders.  American Civil War  CSS Savannah, a Confederate privateer. During the Civil War Confederate President Jefferson Davis issued letters of marque to anyone who would employ their ship to either attack Union shipping or bring badly needed supplies through the Union blockade into southern ports.Brainerd Dyer, \\"Confederate Naval and Privateering Activities in the Pacific.\\" Pacific Historical Review 3.4 (1934): 433-443. Most of the supplies brought into the Confederacy were carried aboard privately owned vessels. When word came about that the Confederacy was willing to pay almost any price for military supplies, various interested parties designed and built specially designed lightweight seagoing steamers, blockade runners specifically designed and built to outrun Union ships on blockade patrol.Hamilton Cochran, Blockade Runners of the Confederacy (U of Alabama Press, 2005). Neither the United States nor Spain authorized privateers in their war in 1898.Scott D.

Warships were recruited by the insurgent governments during Spanish American wars of independence to destroy Spanish trade, and capture Spanish Merchant vessels. The private armed vessels came largely from the United States. Seamen from Britain, the United States, and France often manned these ships.

The term is generally used only to describe systems serving relatively small areas such as airports, downtown districts or theme parks. The term was originally applied to three different systems, developed roughly at the same time. One was Skybus, an automated mass transit system prototyped by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation beginning in 1964. The second, alternately called the People Mover and Minirail, opened in Montreal at Expo 67. Finally the last, called PeopleMover or WEDway PeopleMover, was an attraction that was originally presented by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and that opened at Disneyland in 1967. Now, however, the term \\"people mover\\" is generic, and may use technologies such as monorail, rail tracks, automated guideway transit or maglev. Propulsion may involve conventional on-board electric motors, linear motors or cable traction. Generally speaking, larger APMs are referred to by other names. The most generic is \\"automated guideway transit\\", which encompasses any automated system regardless of size. Some complex APMs deploy fleets of small vehicles over a track network with off-line stations, and supply near non-stop service to passengers. These taxi-like systems are more usually referred to as personal rapid transit (PRT). Larger systems, with vehicles with 20 to 40 passengers, are sometimes referred to as \\"group rapid transit\\" (GRT), although this term is not particularly common. Other complex APMs have similar characteristics to mass transit systems, and there is no clear cut distinction between a complex APM of this type and an automated mass transit system. Another term \\"light metro\\" is also applied to describe the system worldwide. History Interior of Satellite Transit System in Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Opened in 1969, it was one of the first operational automated people mover systems in the world. =Never-Stop Railway= One of the first automated systems for human transportation was the screw-driven 'Never-Stop-Railway',British Film Institute Never-Stop RailwayBritish Pathe (agency) Never-Stop Railway film (probably 1925) constructed for the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, London in 1924. This railway consisted of 88 unmanned carriages, on a continuous double track along the northern and eastern sides of the exhibition, with reversing loops at either end. The carriages ran on two parallel concrete beams and were guided by pulleys running on the inner side of these concrete beams,British Pathe (agency) Never-Stop Railway film (probably 1925), see at 01:24 for analyzing the guiding systemHulton Archive:modified tractor running on the 'Never Stop Railway' and were propelled by gripping a revolving screw thread running between the tracks in a pit; by adjusting the pitch of this thread at different points, the carriages could be sped up, or slowed down to a walking pace at stations, to allow passengers to join and leave. The railway ran reliably for the two years of the exhibition, and was then dismantled. Small sections of this track bed, and a nearby heavy rail track bed, have been proposed for reuse.The Times Comment on light-rail proposal = Goodyear and Stephens-Adamson = PHX Sky Train in Phoenix, Arizona, United States opened in 2013 In late 1949, Mike Kendall, chief engineer and Chairman of the Board of Stephens-Adamson Manufacturing Company, an Illinois-based manufacturer of conveyor belts and systems, asked Al Neilson, an engineer in the Industrial Products Division of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., if Goodyear had ever considered working on People Movers. He felt that with Goodyear's ability to move materials in large quantities on conveyor belts they should consider moving batches of people. Four years of engineering design, development and testing led to a joint patent being issued for three types of people movers, named Speedwalk, Speedramp, and Carveyor. Goodyear would sell the concept and Stephens-Adamson would manufacture and install the components. A Speedwalk consisted of a flat conveyor belt riding on a series of rollers, or a flat slippery surface, moving at (approximately half the speed of walking). The passengers would walk onto the belt and could stand or walk to the exit point. They were supported by a moving handrail. Customers were expected to include airport terminals, ballparks, train stations, etc. Today, several manufacturers produce similar units called moving walkways. A Speedramp was very similar to a Speedwalk but it was used to change elevations; up or down a floor level. This could have been accomplished by an escalator, but the Speedramp would allow wheeled luggage, small handcarts etc. to ride the belt at an operating cost predicted to be much lower than escalators or elevators. The first successful installation of a Speedramp was in the spring of 1954 at the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Station in Jersey City, New Jersey to connect the Erie Railroad to the Hudson and Manhattan Tubes. This unit was long with a rise of on a 15 degree grade, and only cost $75,000. A Carveyor consisted of many small cubicles or cars carrying ten people riding on a flat conveyor belt from point A to point B. The belt rode on a series of motorized rollers. The purpose of the motorized rollers was to facilitate the gradual acceleration and deceleration speeds on the conveyor belt and overcome the tendency of all belts to stretch at start up and during shutdown. At point \\"A\\" passengers would enter a Speedwalk running parallel to the belts and cars of the Carveyor. The cars would be moving at the same speed as the Speedwalk; the passengers would enter the cars and be seated, while the motorized rollers would increase the speed of the cars up to the traveling speed (which would be preset depending on the distance to be covered). At point B Passengers could disembark and by means of a series of flat slower belts (Speedwalks) go to other Carveyors to other destinations or out to the street. The cars at point B would continue on rollers around a semicircle and then reverse the process carrying passengers back to point A. The initial installation was to be the 42nd Street Shuttle in New York City between Times Square and Grand Central station. The first mention of the Carveyor in a hardback book was in There's Adventure in Civil Engineering by Neil P. Ruzic (1958), one of a series of books published by Popular Mechanics in the 1950s in their \\"Career\\" series. In the book the Carveyor was already installed and operational in downtown Los Angeles. Colonel Sydney H. Bingham, Chairman of the New York City Board of Transportation, had several meetings with a group of architects who were trying to revamp the whole New York City Subway system in the heart of town to connect Pennsylvania Station, Madison Square Garden, Times Square, Grand Central and several new office complexes together. Several of these architects were involved in other programs, and in later years many variations of the Carveyor people movers were developed. In November 1954 the New York City Transit Authority issued an order to Goodyear and Stephens-Adamson to build a complete Carveyor system between Times Square and Grand Central. A brief summary and confirmation can be found in Time magazine on November 15, 1954. under the heading \\"Subway of the Future\\". The cost was to be under $4 million, but the order was never fulfilled due to political difficulties. Chocolate World in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Disneyland in California, and Walt Disney World in Florida are among many locations that have used variations of the Carveyor concept. = Other developments = Zhujiang New Town APM in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China The term 'people mover' was used by Walt Disney, when he and his Imagineers were working on the new 1967 Tomorrowland at Disneyland. The name was used as a working title for a new attraction, the PeopleMover. According to Imagineer Bob Gurr, \\"the name got stuck,\\" and it was no longer a working title. Starting in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, people movers were the topic of intense development around the world. Worried about the growing congestion and pollution in downtown areas due to the spread of cars, many countries started studying mass transit systems that would lower capital costs to the point where any city could afford to deploy them. Most of these systems used elevated guideways, which were much less expensive to deploy than tunnels. However, elevating the track causes problems with noise, so traditional steel-wheel-on-rail solutions were rare as they squealed when rounding bends in the rails. Rubber tired solutions were common, but some systems used hovercraft techniques or various magnetic levitation systems. Two major government funded APM projects are notable. In Germany, Mannesmann Demag and Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm developed a system known as Cabinentaxi during the 1970s. Cabinentaxi featured small cars with from four to eight seats that were called to pick up passengers on-demand and drove directly to their destination. The stations were \\"offline\\", allowing the cabs to stop by moving off the main lines while other cars continued to their destinations. The system was designed so the cars could be adapted to run on top or bottom of the track (but not easily converted from one to the other), allowing dual- track movements from a single elevated guideway only slightly wider than the cars. A test track was completed in 1975 and ran until development was completed in 1979, but no deployments followed and the companies abandoned the system shortly thereafter. In the U.S., a 1966 federal bill provided funding that led to the development of APM systems under the Downtown People Mover Program. Four systems were developed, Rohr's ROMAG, LTV's AirTrans, Ford's APT and Otis Elevator's hovercraft design. A major presentation of the systems was organized as TRANSPO'72 at Dulles Airport where the various systems were presented to delegations from numerous cities in the US. Prototype systems and test tracks were built during the 1970s. One notable example was Pittsburgh's Skybus, which was proposed by the Port Authority of Allegheny County to replace its streetcar system, which, having large stretches of private right of way, was not suited for bus conversion. A short demonstration line was set up in South Park and large tracts of land were secured for its facilities. However, opposition arose to the notion that it would replace the streetcar system. This, combined with the immaturity of the technology and other factors, led the Port Authority to abandon the project and pursue alternatives. By the start of the 1980s most politicians had lost interest in the concept and the project was repeatedly de-funded in the early 1980s. Only two APMs were developed as a part of the People Mover Program in the US, the Metromover in Miami, and the Detroit People Mover. The Jacksonville Skyway was built in the late 1980s. From development to implementation Although many government-funded systems were generally considered failures, several APM systems developed by other groups have been much more successful. Lighter systems with shorter tracks are widely deployed at airports; the world's first airport people movers, the Tampa International Airport People Movers, were installed in 1971 at Tampa International Airport in the United States. APMs have now become common at large airports and hospitals in the United States. Driver-less metros have become common in Europe and parts of Asia. The economics of automated trains tend to reduce the scale so tied to \\"mass\\" transit (the largest operating expense is the driver's salary, which is only affordable if very large numbers of passengers are paying fares), so that small-scale installations are feasible. Thus cities normally thought of as too small to build a metro (e.g. Rennes, Lausanne, Brescia, etc.) are now doing so. On September 30, 2006, the Peachliner in Komaki, Aichi Prefecture, Japan became that nation's first people mover to cease operations.

A typical car ferry in Istanbul, Turkey Passenger area of a Norwegian ferry With the exception of Mariehamn Airport, connections to the √Öland Islands are largely based on ferries. Photo of the M/S Viggen ferry in Br√§nd√∂, √Öland. A ferry is a merchant vessel used to carry passengers, and sometimes vehicles and cargo, across a body of water. A passenger ferry with many stops, such as in Venice, Italy, is sometimes called a water bus or water taxi. Ferries form a part of the public transport systems of many waterside cities and islands, allowing direct transit between points at a capital cost much lower than bridges or tunnels. Ship connections of much larger distances (such as over long distances in water bodies like the Mediterranean Sea) may also be called ferry services, especially if they carry vehicles. History =In ancient times= The profession of the ferryman is embodied in Greek mythology in Charon, the boatman who transported souls across the River Styx to the Underworld. Speculation that a pair of oxen propelled a ship having a water wheel can be found in 4th century Roman literature \\"Anonymus De Rebus Bellicis\\". Though impractical, there is no reason why it could not work and such a ferry, modified by using horses, was used in Lake Champlain in 19th-century America. See Experiment (horse powered boat). Notable services =Africa= Gullmar Fjord close to Lysekil, Sweden. Sweden has a lot of these yellow ferries that are run by the Swedish Transport Administration. Almost all of them are free of charge. =Europe= The busiest seaway in the world, the English Channel, connects Great Britain and mainland Europe, with ships sailing from the UK ports of Dover, Newhaven, Poole, https://www.phc.co.uk/ Portsmouth and Plymouth to French ports, such as Calais, Dunkirk, Dieppe, Roscoff, Cherbourg-Octeville, Caen, St Malo and Le Havre. The busiest ferry route to France is the Dover to Calais crossing with approximately 9,168,000 passengers using the service in 2018.Ferry to France Statistics Ferries from Great Britain also sail to Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Ireland. Some ferries carry mainly tourist traffic, but most also carry freight, and some are exclusively for the use of freight lorries. In Britain, car-carrying ferries are sometimes referred to as RORO (roll-on, roll-off) for the ease by which vehicles can board and leave. leaving Helsinki via the Kustaanmiekka strait to the Baltic Sea. The busiest single ferry route in terms of the number of departures is across the northern part of √òresund, between Helsingborg, Scania, Sweden and Elsinore, Denmark. Before the √òresund bridge was opened in July 2000, car and \\"car and train\\" ferries departed up to seven times every hour. This has since been reduced, but a car ferry still departs from each harbor every 15 minutes during daytime. The route is around and the crossing takes 22 minutes. Today, all ferries on this route are constructed so that they do not need to turn around in the harbors. This also means that the ferries lack stems and sterns, since the vessels sail in both directions. Starboard and port-side are dynamic, depending on the direction the ferry sails. Despite the short crossing, the ferries are equipped with restaurants (on three out of four ferries), cafeterias, and kiosks. Passengers without cars often make a double or triple return journey in the restaurants; for this, a single journey ticket is sufficient. Passenger and bicycle passenger tickets are inexpensive compared with longer routes. Festos Palace in Piraeus, Greece Large cruiseferries sail in the Baltic Sea between Finland, √Öland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Saint Petersburg, Russia and from Italy to Sardinia, Corsica, Spain and Greece. In many ways, these ferries are like cruise ships, but they can also carry hundreds of cars on car decks. Besides providing passenger and car transport across the sea, Baltic Sea cruise-ferries are a popular tourist destination unto themselves, with multiple restaurants, nightclubs, bars, shops and entertainment on board. Also many smaller ferries operate on domestic routes in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. The south-west and southern parts of the Baltic Sea has several routes mainly for heavy traffic and cars. The ferry routes of Trelleborg-Rostock, Trelleborg-Travem√ºnde, Trelleborg- ≈öwinouj≈õcie, Gedser-Rostock, Gdynia-Karlskrona, and Ystad-≈öwinouj≈õcie are all typical transports ferries. On the longer of these routes, simple cabins are available. The R√∏dby-Puttgarden route also transports day passenger trains between Copenhagen and Hamburg, and on the Trelleborg-Sassnitz route, it also has capacities for the daily night trains between Berlin and Malm√∂. In Istanbul, ferries connect the European and Asian shores of Bosphorus, as well as Princes Islands and nearby coastal towns. In 2014, ƒ∞DO transported 47 million passengers, the largest ferry system in the world. The world's shortest ferry line is the Ferry Lina In T√∂reboda, Sweden. It takes around 20‚Äì25 seconds and is hand powered. =North America= Tsawwassen from Swartz Bay. Route 1 is BC Ferries busiest route. Due to the numbers of large freshwater lakes and length of shoreline in Canada, various provinces and territories have ferry services. BC Ferries operates the third largest ferry service in the world which carries travellers between Vancouver Island and the British Columbia mainland on the country's west coast. This ferry service operates to other islands including the Gulf Islands and Haida Gwaii. In 2015, BC Ferries carried more than 8 million vehicles and 20 million passengers. Canada's east coast has been home to numerous inter- and intra-provincial ferry and coastal services, including a large network operated by the federal government under CN Marine and later Marine Atlantic. Private and publicly owned ferry operations in eastern Canada include Marine Atlantic, serving the island of Newfoundland, as well as Bay, NFL, CTMA, Coastal Transport, and STQ. Canadian waters in the Great Lakes once hosted numerous ferry services, but these have been reduced to those offered by Owen Sound Transportation and several smaller operations. There are also several commuter passenger ferry services operated in major cities, such as Metro Transit in Halifax, Toronto Island ferries in Toronto and SeaBus in Vancouver. The MV Spokane sailing from Edmonds to Kingston, one of ten routes served by Washington State Ferries. Washington State Ferries operates the most extensive ferry system in the continental United States and the second largest in the world by vehicles carried, with ten routes on Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca serving terminals in Washington and Vancouver Island. In 2016, Washington State Ferries carried 10.5 million vehicles and 24.2 million riders in total. The Alaska Marine Highway System provides service between Bellingham, Washington and various towns and villages throughout Southeast and Southwest Alaska, including crossings of the Gulf of Alaska. AMHS provides affordable access to many small communities with no road connection or airport. The Staten Island Ferry in New York City, sailing between the boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island, is the nation's single busiest ferry route by passenger volume. Unlike riders on many other ferry services, Staten Island Ferry passengers do not pay any fare to ride it. New York City also has a network of smaller ferries, or water taxis, that shuttle commuters along the Hudson River from locations in New Jersey and Northern Manhattan down to the midtown, downtown and Wall Street business centers. Several ferry companies also offer service linking midtown and lower Manhattan with locations in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, crossing the city's East River. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in February 2015 that city would begin an expanded Citywide Ferry Service some time in 2017 linking heretofore relatively isolated communities such as Manhattan's Lower East Side, Soundview in The Bronx, Astoria and the Rockaways in Queens and such Brooklyn neighborhoods as Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, and Red Hook with existing ferry landings in Lower Manhattan and Midtown Manhattan. This service was finally launched as NYC Ferry in May, 2017. The New Orleans area also has many ferries in operation that carry both vehicles and pedestrians. Most notable is the Algiers Ferry. This service has been in continuous operation since 1827 and is one of the oldest operating ferries in North America. MV LeConte and MV Kennicott near Juneau, Alaska In New England, vehicle-carrying ferry services between mainland Cape Cod and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket are operated by The Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority, which sails year-round between Woods Hole and Vineyard Haven as well as Hyannis and Nantucket. Seasonal service is also operated from Woods Hole to Oak Bluffs from Memorial Day to Labor Day. As there are no bridges or tunnels connecting the islands to the mainland, The Steamship Authority ferries in addition to being the only method for transporting private cars to or from the islands, also serves as the only link by which heavy freight and supplies such as food and gasoline can be trucked to the islands. Additionally, Hy-Line Cruises operates high speed catamaran service from Hyannis to both islands, as well as traditional ferries, and several smaller operations run seasonal passenger only service primarily geared towards tourist day-trippers from other mainland ports, including New Bedford, (New Bedford Fast Ferry) Falmouth, (Island Queen ferry and Falmouth Ferry) and Harwich (Freedom Cruise Line). Ferries also bring riders and vehicles across Long Island Sound to such Connecticut cities as Bridgeport and New London, and to Block Island in Rhode Island from points on Long Island. Transbay commuting in the San Francisco Bay Area was primarily ferry based until the advent of automobiles in the 1940s and most bridges in the area were built to supplant ferry services. By the 1970s, ferries were primarily used by tourists with Golden Gate Ferry, an organization under the ownership as the same governing body as the Golden Gate Bridge, left as the sole commute operator. The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake prompted restoration of service to the East Bay. The modern ferry network is primarily under the authority of San Francisco Bay Ferry, connecting with cities as far as Vallejo. Tourist excursions are also offered by Blue & Gold Fleet and Red & White Fleet. A ferry serves Angel Island (which also accepts private craft). Alcatraz is served exclusively by ferry service administered by the National Park Service. Until the completion of the Mackinac Bridge in the 1950s, ferries were used for vehicle transportation between the Lower and the Upper Peninsulas of Michigan, across the Straits of Mackinac in the United States. Ferry service for bicycles and passengers continues across the straits for transport to Mackinac Island, where motorized vehicles are almost completely prohibited. This crossing is made possible by three ferry lines, Arnold Transit Company, Shepler's Ferry, and Star Line Ferry. A ferry service runs between Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Muskegon, Michigan operated by Lake Express. Another ferry SS Badger operates between Manitowoc, Wisconsin and Ludington, Michigan. Both cross Lake Michigan. Mexico has ferry services run by Baja Ferries that connect La Paz located on the Baja California Peninsula with Mazatl√°n and Topolobampo. Passenger ferries also run from Playa del Carmen to the island of Cozumel. North Carolina is home to the second-largest ferry system in the United States. =Oceania= at port in Devonport, Australia. In Australia, two Spirit of Tasmania ferries carry passengers and vehicles across Bass Strait, the body of water that separates Tasmania from the Australian mainland, often under turbulent sea conditions. These run overnight but also include day crossings in peak time. Both ferries are based in the northern Tasmanian port city of Devonport and sail to Melbourne The Manly Ferry 'MV Freshwater' The double-ended Freshwater-class ferry cuts an iconic shape as it makes its way up and down Sydney Harbour New South Wales, Australia between Manly and Circular Quay In New Zealand, ferries connect Wellington in the North Island with Picton in the South Island, linking New Zealand's two main islands. The route is , and is run by two companies ‚Äì government-owned Interislander, and independent Bluebridge, who say the trip takes three and half hours. =Asia= A ferry underway in Penang, Malaysia. The inside of a passenger ferry on route between Shikoku and Kyushu. The number of actual seats is usually very limited on Japanese passenger ferries, with larger spaces dedicated to tatami or broadloom areas where passengers can sit or lie down In Hong Kong, Star Ferry carry passengers across Victoria Harbour. Other carriers ferry travellers between Hong Kong Island and outlying islands like Cheung Chau, Lantau Island and Lamma Island. The Malaysian state of Penang is home to the oldest ferry service in the country. This service, now renamed Rapid Ferry, connects the Raja Tun Uda Ferry Terminal at Weld Quay in George Town on Penang Island with the Sultan Abdul Halim Ferry Terminal in Butterworth on Peninsular Malaysia. It has also become a tourist attraction among foreigners. Batamfast Fast Ferry transport passengers from Singapore's HarbourFront Centre and Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to Indonesia's Batam Centre Ferry Terminal. Sindo Ferry transport passengers from Singapore's HarbourFront Centre and Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to Indonesia's Batam Centre Ferry Terminal, Sekupang Ferry Terminal, Waterfront Ferry Terminal, Tanjung Balai Ferry Terminal and Sri Bintan Pura Ferry Terminal. =India= India's ro-ro ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 22 October 2017. It aims to connect South Gujarat and Saurashtra currently separated by 360 km of roadway to 31 km of ferry service. It is a part of the larger Sagar Mala project. Water transport in Mumbai consists of ferries, hovercrafts, and catamarans, operated by various government agencies as well as private entities. The Kerala State Water Transport Department (SWTD), operating under the Ministry of Transport, Government of Kerala, India regulates the inland navigation systems in the Indian state of Kerala and provides inland water transport facilities. It stands for catering to the passenger and cargo traffic needs of the inhabitants of the waterlogged areas of the Districts of Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kollam, Ernakulam, Kannur and Kasargode. SWTD ferry service is also one of the most affordable modes to enjoy the beauty of the scenic Kerala backwaters. Types Ferry designs depend on the length of the route, the passenger or vehicle capacity required, speed requirements and the water conditions the craft must deal with. =Double-ended= Ferry in Ontario (Manitoulin Island) vehicles load via the front and back of the ferry opening hull Double-ended ferries have interchangeable bows and sterns, allowing them to shuttle back and forth between two terminals without having to turn around. Well-known double-ended ferry systems include the BC Ferries, the Staten Island Ferry, Washington State Ferries, Star Ferry, several ferries on the North Carolina Ferry System, and the Lake Champlain Transportation Company. Most Norwegian fjord and coastal ferries are double-ended vessels. All ferries from southern Prince Edward Island to the mainland of Canada were double-ended. This service was discontinued upon completion of the Confederation Bridge. Some ferries in Sydney, Australia and British Columbia are also double-ended. In 2008, BC Ferries launched three of the largest double-ended ferries in the world. =Hydrofoil= Hydrofoils have the advantage of higher cruising speeds, succeeding hovercraft on some English Channel routes where the ferries now compete against the Eurotunnel and Eurostar trains that use the Channel Tunnel. Passenger-only hydrofoils also proved a practical, fast and relatively economical solution in the Canary Islands, but were recently replaced by faster catamaran \\"high speed\\" ferries that can carry cars. Their replacement by the larger craft is seen by critics as a retrograde step given that the new vessels use much more fuel and foster the inappropriate use of cars in islands already suffering from the impact of mass tourism. =Hovercraft= Mark 3 SR.N4 hovercraft, Dover Hovercraft were developed in the 1960s and 1970s to carry cars. The largest was the massive SR.N4 which carried cars in its centre section with ramps at the bow and stern between England and France. The hovercraft was superseded by catamarans which are nearly as fast and are less affected by sea and weather conditions. Only one service now remains, a foot passenger service between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight run by Hovertravel. =Catamaran= Incat built Catamaran HSC Manannan entering Douglas, Isle of Man Since 1990 high speed catamarans have revolutionised ferry services, replacing hovercraft, hydrofoils and conventional monohull ferries. In the 1990s there were a variety of builders, but the industry has consolidated to two builders of large vehicular ferries between 60 and 120 metres. Incat of Hobart, Tasmania favours a Wave-piercing hull to deliver a smooth ride, while Austal of Perth, Western Australia builds ships based on SWATH designs. Both these companies also compete in the smaller river ferry industry with a number of other ship builders. Stena Line once operated the largest catamarans in the world, the Stena HSS class, between the United Kingdom and Ireland. These waterjet-powered vessels, displaced 19,638 tonnes, accommodating 375 passenger cars and 1,500 passengers. Other examples of these super-size catamarans are found in the Brittany Ferries fleet with the Normandie Express and the Normandie Vitesse. =Roll-on/roll-off= Pont-Aven, the Brittany Ferries flagship Roll-on/roll-off ferries (RORO) are large conventional ferries named for the ease by which vehicles can board and leave. = Cruiseferry / RoPax = A cruiseferry is a ship that combines the features of a cruise ship with a roll-on/roll-off ferry. They are also known as RoPax for their combined Roll on/Roll Off and passenger design. =Fast RoPax ferry= MS Superfast XI Fast RoPax ferries are conventional ferries with a large garage intake and a relatively large passenger capacity, with conventional diesel propulsion and propellers that sail over . Pioneering this class of ferries was Attica Group, when it introduced Superfast I between Greece and Italy in 1995 through its subsidiary company Superfast Ferries. Cabins, if existent, are much smaller than those on cruise ships. =Turntable ferry= Turntable ferry at Isle of Skye, Scotland This type of ferry allows vehicles to load from the \\"side\\". The vehicle platform can be turned. When loading, the platform is turned sideways to allow sideways loading of vehicles. Then the platform is turned back, in line with the vessel, and the journey across water is made. =Pontoon ferry= The Lower Kingswear to Dartmouth ferry, Devon, England. The pontoon carries eight cars and is towed across the River Dart by a small tug. Two ropes connect the tug to the pontoon. Pontoon ferries carry vehicles across rivers and lakes and are widely used in less-developed countries with large rivers where the cost of bridge construction is prohibitive. One or more vehicles are carried on a pontoon with ramps at either end for vehicles to drive on and off. Cable ferries are usually pontoon ferries, but pontoon ferries on larger rivers are motorised and able to be steered independently like a boat. =Train ferry= Train and car ferry between Calabria and Sicily, Italy A train ferry is a ship designed to carry railway vehicles. Typically, one level of the ship is fitted with railway tracks, and the vessel has a door at either or both of the front and rear to give access to the wharves. =Foot ferry= Foot ferries are small craft used to ferry foot passengers, and often also cyclists, over rivers. These are either self- propelled craft or cable ferries. Such ferries are for example to be found on the lower River Scheldt in Belgium and in particular the Netherlands. Regular foot ferry service also exists in the capital of the Czech Republic, Prague, and across the Yarra River in Melbourne, Australia at Newport. Restored, expanded ferry service in the Port of New York and New Jersey uses boats for pedestrians only. =Cable ferry= One of several self-propelled cable ferries that cross the lower reaches of the Murray River in South Australia Very short distances may be crossed by a cable or chain ferry, which is usually a pontoon ferry (see above), where the ferry is propelled along and steered by cables connected to each shore. Sometimes the cable ferry is human powered by someone on the boat. Reaction ferries are cable ferries that use the perpendicular force of the current as a source of power. Examples of a current propelled ferry are the four Rhine ferries in Basel, Switzerland. Cable ferries may be used in fast-flowing rivers across short distances. With an ocean crossing of approximately 1900 metres, the cable ferry between Vancouver Island and Denman Island in British Columbia; is the longest one in the world. Free ferries operate in some parts of the world, such as at Woolwich in London, England (across the River Thames); in Amsterdam, Netherlands (across the IJ waterway); along the Murray River in South Australia, and across many lakes in British Columbia. Many cable ferries operate on lakes and rivers in Canada, among them a cable ferry that charges a toll operates on the Rivi√®re des Prairies between Laval-sur-le-Lac and √éle Bizard in Quebec, Canada. In Finland there were 40 road ferries (cable ferries) in 2009, on lakes, rivers and on sea between islands. =Air ferries= In the 1950s and 1960s, travel on an \\"air ferry\\" was possible‚Äîairplanes, often ex-military, specially equipped to take a small number of cars in addition to foot passengers. These operated various routes including between the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. Companies operating such services included Channel Air Bridge, Silver City Airways, and Corsair. The term is also applied to any \\"ferrying\\" by air, and is commonly used when referring to airborne military operations. Docking Drawbridge of the ferry lies on the ferry slip. This double sided ferry measures , and carries 2000 passengers with 60 cars Ferries often dock at specialized facilities designed to position the boat for loading and unloading, called a ferry slip. If the ferry transports road vehicles or railway carriages there will usually be an adjustable ramp called an apron that is part of the slip. In other cases, the apron ramp will be a part of the ferry itself, acting as a wave guard when elevated and lowered to meet a fixed ramp at the terminus ‚Äì a road segment that extends partially underwater or meet the ferry slip. Records =Gross tonnage= The world's largest ferries are typically those operated in Europe, with different vessels holding the record depending on whether length, gross tonnage or car vehicle capacity is the metric. =Oldest= On 11 October 1811, inventor John Stevens' ship the Juliana, began operation as the first steam-powered ferry (service was between New York City, and Hoboken, New Jersey). The Elwell Ferry, a cable ferry in North Carolina, travels a distance of , shore to shore, with a travel time of five minutes. A contender as oldest ferry in continuous operation is the Mersey Ferry from Liverpool to Birkenhead, England. In 1150, the Benedictine Priory at Birkenhead was established. The monks used to charge a small fare to row passengers across the estuary. In 1330, Edward III granted a charter to the Priory and its successors for ever: \\"the right of ferry there... for men, horses and goods, with leave to charge reasonable tolls\\". However, there may have been a short break following the Dissolution of the monasteries after 1536. Another claimant as the oldest ferry service in continuous operation is the Rocky Hill ‚Äì Glastonbury Ferry, running between the towns of Rocky Hill and Glastonbury, Connecticut. Established in 1655, the ferry has run continuously since, only ceasing operation every winter when the river freezes over. A long running salt water ferry service is the Halifax/Dartmouth ferry, running between the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, which has run year-round since 1752, and is currently run by the region's transit authority, Metro Transit. However, the Mersey Ferry predates it as the oldest salt water ferry. =Largest networks= * Waxholmsbolaget ‚Äì 21 vessels serving around 300 ports of call in the Stockholm archipelago. * Istanbul Ferry Network ‚Äì 87 vessels serving 86 ports of call in and around the Bosporus of Istanbul, Turkey. * BC Ferries ‚Äì 36 vessels serving 47 ports of call along the west coast of British Columbia, Canada, carrying 22.3 million passengers annually. * Caledonian MacBrayne ‚Äì 31 vessels serving 50 ports of call along the west coast of Scotland, carrying 1.43 million passengers annually. * Sydney Ferries ‚Äì 31 vessels serving 36 ports of call in Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), carrying 15.3 million passengers annually. * Washington State Ferries ‚Äì 28 vessels serving 20 ports of call around Puget Sound of Washington, United States, carrying 24.2 million passengers annually. * Metrolink Queensland ‚Äì 21 vessels serving 26 ports of call along the Brisbane River in Brisbane, Australia, carrying 2.7 million passengers annually. * Soci√©t√© des traversiers du Qu√©bec =Busiest networks= * Washington State Ferries ‚Äì 24.2 million passengers annually. * Staten Island Ferry in New York City ‚Äì 23.9 million passengers annually; busiest one line ferry in the world. * BC Ferries ‚Äì 22.3 million passengers annually. * Star Ferry in Hong Kong ‚Äì 19.7 million passengers annually.http://www.starferry.com.hk/tc/operationalInfo =Fastest= The gas turbine powered Luciano Federico L operated by Montevideo-based Buquebus, holds the Guinness World Record for the fastest car ferry in the world, in service between Montevideo, Uruguay and Buenos Aires, Argentina: its maximum speed, achieved in sea trials, was . It can carry 450 passengers and 52 cars along the route.  Sustainability  Fast Ro-Pax ferries, like MS Star, have notable CO2 emissions. The contributions of ferry travel to climate change have received less scrutiny than land and air transport, and vary considerably according to factors like speed and the number of passengers carried. Average carbon dioxide emissions by ferries per passenger-kilometre seem to be . However, ferries between Finland and Sweden produce of CO2, with total emissions equalling a CO2 equivalent of , while ferries between Finland and Estonia produce of CO2 with total emissions equalling a CO2 equivalent of . =Alternative fuels= With the price of oil at high levels, and with increasing pressure from consumers for measures to tackle global warming, a number of innovations for energy and the environment were put forward at the Interferry conference in Stockholm. According to the company Solar Sailor, hybrid marine power and solar wing technology are suitable for use with ferries, private yachts and even tankers. Alternative fuels are becoming more widespread on ferries. The fastest passenger ferry in the world Buquebus, runs on LNG, while Sweden's Stena plans to operate its 1500-passenger ferries on methanol in 2015. Both fuels reduce emissions considerably and replace costly diesel fuel. Megawatt-class battery electric ferries operate in Scandinavia, with several more scheduled for operation. As of 2017, the world's biggest purely electric ferry was the , which operates on the Helsing√∏r‚ÄìHelsingborg ferry route across the √òresund between Denmark and Sweden. The ferry weights 8414 tonnes, and has an electric storage capacity of more than 4 MWh. Since 2015, Norwegian ferry company Norled has operated e-ferry on the Lavik-Opedal connection on the E39 north of Bergen. Further north on the Norwegian west coast, the connection between Anda and Lote will be the world's first route served only by e-ferries. The first of two ships, MF Gloppefjord, was put into service in January 2018, followed by MF Eidsfjord. The owner, Fjord1, has commissioned a further seven battery-powered ferries to be in operation from 2020. A total of 60 battery powered car ferries are expected to be operational in Norway by 2021.https://www.tu.no/artikler/i-2021-vil-norge-ha-60-ferger- med-batterier-na-ma-vegdirektoratet-finne-en-standardlosning-for-lading/414997 WWW.TU.NO (In Norwegian).

A major character in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, he also has a smaller role in Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and a one-line cameo in Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, as well as a role in the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The first fully computer-generated supporting character in a live-action film, he has been portrayed by Ahmed Best in most of his appearances. Jar Jar's primary role in Episode I was to provide comic relief for the audience. He was met with overwhelming dislike from both critics and audiences, and is recognized as one of the most hated characters in Star Wars and the history of film in general, with some critics even considering him a racist caricature. However, part of this reception changed in 2015 after a popular fan theory, later confirmed by Best, suggested Jar Jar had been actually written as a manipulative villain in The Phantom Menace before being discarded in the next films.  Conception  George Lucas was inspired to develop Jar Jar based on the Disney character Goofy. Singer Michael Jackson wanted to play the role, but wished to portray the character using prosthetics while Lucas wanted him to be all CGI. Ahmed Best was cast based on his work in the production of Stomp, as Lucas wanted someone athletic for the role. During his audition he performed several martial arts moves and flips, which according to Best was a contrast to how Lucas pictured the character, more in line with comedic silent actors such as Buster Keaton. After Lucas walked out of the audition, Best felt he had failed it. Terryl Whitlatch created the final designs for the \\"cowardly and insecure\\" character. Best wore a prosthetic costume to portray Jar Jar, which cost about $100,000 and served as a reference for the actors to interact with, animators to base the performance on, and digital artists to match the lighting. He was the first computer-generated supporting character in a live-action film, although in a small number of shots (such as those only showing the character's hands or feet), the costume was not replaced with CGI. Appearances = Films = The Phantom Menace Jar Jar Binks first appears in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace as a bumbling, foolish Gungan from the planet Naboo who is banished by his tribe as punishment for his clumsiness. He is nearly killed by a Trade Federation transport, only to be saved at the last minute by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson). Qui-Gon and his padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), persuade Jar Jar's tribe to release him to their custody as a guide. He later goes with the Jedi and Padm√© Amidala (Natalie Portman) to the planet Tatooine, where he meets and befriends nine-year-old slave Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). Jar Jar later appears in the film's climactic battle scene, where he leads his fellow Gungans, as a general in the Gungan army, in defeating the Trade Federation. After the battle, he appears at the funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn and in the ending parade with his fellow Gungans. Attack of the Clones Jar Jar's role in Attack of the Clones is much smaller, but his actions are significant. Ten years after helping to save his planet, he is a delegate to the Galactic Senate and as such, plays a role in bringing his old friends, Obi-Wan and Anakin (Hayden Christensen) back to Coruscant, where he greets them with enthusiasm. Later, on the behalf of the Naboo, he gives a speech to the assembled Senate in favor of granting Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) vast emergency powers. Revenge of the Sith Jar Jar appears in only a few scenes in Revenge of the Sith, and has no dialogue (besides a brief \\"'scuse me\\" at one point). He was originally given some dialogue in the beginning, but this was cut. Another cut scene would have shown Palpatine mocking Jar Jar for putting him in power before crowning himself emperor. He is most prominently featured in Padm√© Amidala's funeral procession at the end of the film, marching sadly behind her coffin alongside Boss Nass. =The Clone Wars television series = Jar Jar Binks is a supporting character in the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, once again voiced by Best, although BJ Hughes voiced the character in three season one episodes. In this series, he is a Senate representative who sometimes accompanies the main characters‚ÄîAnakin, Obi-Wan, Padm√©, and Anakin's padawan Ahsoka Tano‚Äîon their adventures. He and Jedi Master Mace Windu are the two main characters of the two-part episode \\"The Disappeared\\" in which they had to search for missing elders and rescue a queen, who was Jar Jar's past love interest.

Chris Taylor of Mashable wrote that the situation reflects real life in that adults disliked Jar Jar in the prequel films, but children were entertained by him. In an interview, director J.J. Abrams suggested that Jar Jar's death might be referenced in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but this did not happen. Legends With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014. In the game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, Jar Jar is shown to have been frozen in carbonite by Darth Vader and kept in the Sith's lair. =Other appearances= Binks is a Lego mini-figure in the Lego Star Wars video games, and appears as an Angry Bird with a hook move called \\"Jar Jar Wings\\" in Angry Birds Star Wars II. Ahmed Best was signed on to portray Binks in the show Star Wars Detours. Reception Even before the release of The Phantom Menace, Jar Jar Binks became the subject of a great deal of media and popular attention. After the film's release, Binks became symbolic of what many reviewers such as Brent Staples (The New York Times), David Edelstein (Slate), and Eric Harrison (Los Angeles Times) considered to be creative flaws of the film. The character was widely rejected and often ridiculed by people who felt that Jar Jar was included in the film solely to appeal to children. Bruce Handy of Vanity Fair wrote that \\"Jar Jar has come to symbolize what many fans see as the faults of the prequel trilogy: characters no one much cares about; a sense of humor geared toward the youngest conceivable audience members; an over-reliance on computer graphics; and story lines devoted to the kinds of convoluted political machinations which wouldn‚Äôt have been out of place in adaptations of I, Claudius or The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, but which fit less snugly in films with characters like Jar Jar Binks.\\" One fan, Mike J. Nichols, created and distributed, free of charge, a modified version of the film, entitled The Phantom Edit, which cut out several scenes featuring what Nichols dubbed 'Jar Jar antics.' The character was also lampooned on an episode of the television show South Park entitled \\"Jakovasaurs\\", in The Fairly OddParents (Episode: \\"Abra-Catastrophe!\\"), The Simpsons (Episode: \\"Co-Dependent's Day\\"), as well as the parody Star Wars episodes of Robot Chicken, in which Best reprised the role in voice-over form. Along with film critics, many have also accused the film's creators of excessive commercialization directed at young children (a criticism first leveled with the introduction of the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi). Star Wars creator George Lucas stated that he feels there is a section of the fanbase who get upset with aspects of Star Wars because \\"the movies are for children but they don't want to admit that... There is a small group of fans that do not like comic sidekicks. They want the films to be tough like The Terminator, and they get very upset and opinionated about anything that has anything to do with being childlike.\\" In July 2018, Best said that the widespread criticism of his character had led to him considering suicide. In April 2019, during the annual Star Wars Celebration event ahead of the 20th anniversary panel for The Phantom Menace, George Lucas named Jar Jar as his favorite Star Wars character. =Allegations of racial caricature= Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal described the character as a \\"Rastafarian Stepin Fetchit on platform hoofs, crossed annoyingly with Butterfly McQueen.\\" Patricia J. Williams suggested that many aspects of Jar Jar's character are highly reminiscent of the archetypes portrayed in blackface minstrelsy,Patricia J. Williams: while others have suggested the character is a \\"laid-back clown character\\" representing a black Caribbean stereotype. George Lucas has denied any racist implications. Ahmed Best also rejected the allegations, saying that \\"Jar Jar has nothing to do with the Caribbean\\". =Speculations of villainy= In late October 2015, a Reddit user by the name of \\"Lumpawarroo\\" published a detailed theory speculating that Binks was originally written as a major antagonist of the series, a manipulative, prominent collaborator of Palpatine, before being written off from his major villain's role due to the character's negative reception. This theory was related to an earlier interview with actor Ahmed Best in /r/IAmA, where he claimed that Jar Jar had been displaced from the story's main focus due to the backlash, implying at the same time that the hate received by the character was not entirely unintentional. The post quickly became popular and received significant media coverage internationally by independent bloggers and major news outlets like The Guardian, The Washington Post, and The New York Times, which included analysis of his actions in The Phantom Menace and gave him the nickname of \\"Darth Jar Jar\\". Journalist Andrew Street from The Guardian called it a \\"classic twist\\", comparing it to Yoda's role in The Empire Strikes Back, while Matt Hickey from Forbes went to the extent of contacting George Lucas about the question, but received no answer. In response to the speculations, Best tweeted, \\"I will say this, it feels really good when the hidden meaning behind the work is seen. No matter how long it takes,\\" apparently confirming the theory. Some months later, he expanded upon his tweet in a YouTube interview, stating, \\"there is a lot about [the theory] that is true, there are some things about it that are not true... Could Jar Jar have evolved into that? I think the answer is yes. Because of the backlash, and rightfully so, Lucasfilm backed off of Jar Jar a lot, but a lot of the influence that I put into the character mirrored a lot of what was already in the Star Wars universe.\\" Best concluded only Lucas could unveil the actual role of Binks, yet he also revealed that a deleted scene from Attack of the Clones would have still shown Palpatine darkly confiding his plans about the Empire to Jar Jar. J. J. Abrams, who directed two installments of the franchise's sequel trilogy after its buyout by Disney, personally approved the theory about the villainous Jar Jar. He described Lumpawarroo's argumentation as an \\"unbelievably lengthy analysis, in a very seriously thought-out way, as to why it's obviously true.\\" References Footnotes Citations External links  Jar Jar Binks quotes from IMDb  * Collection of negative Jar Jar comments from major media sources. * Characters created by George Lucas Fantasy television characters Fictional amphibians Film characters introduced in 1999 Fictional diplomats Fictional generals Fictional humanoids Fictional senators Film sidekicks Male characters in film Male characters in television Star Wars CGI characters Star Wars Skywalker Saga characters Star Wars: The Clone Wars characters ","title":"Jar Jar Binks"},{"id":"50779","text":"Endor or Ein Dor may refer to: * Endor (village), from the Hebrew Bible, a Canaanite village where the Witch of Endor lived * Indur, a Palestinian village depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war * Ein Dor, a Kibbutz in modern Israel * ENDOR, electron nuclear double resonance, a variation of electron spin resonance * Endor (Star Wars), the fictional forest moon which is home to the Ewoks, or the gas giant the moon orbits, of the same name * Middle-earth, in J.

He is a supporting character portrayed by Denis Lawson in the original Star Wars trilogy. He is also featured in the Star Wars expanded universe, most notably as the lead character in most of the X-Wing novels. Wedge has also appeared in the sequel trilogy film The Rise of Skywalker (2019), with Lawson reprising his role, and the 2014 animated series Star Wars Rebels, voiced by Nathan Kress. Before defecting to the Rebel Alliance, Antilles was an Imperial cadet (callsign: TIE SS25) of the Skystrike Academy. Antilles founded Rogue Squadron with his friend Luke Skywalker. His superior piloting skills, in-depth knowledge of Imperial war doctrine, and tactical leadership quickly propelled him though the ranks to become Marshal of the Alliance Starfighter Corps. Wedge is notable for being the only Rebel pilot to have survived both attack runs on the Death Stars at the battles of Yavin and Endor.  Depiction  Wedge first appears in Star Wars during the Rebels' Death Star attack briefing. In this scene Wedge is portrayed by Colin Higgins and voiced by David Ankrum, who dubs the character throughout the film. Denis Lawson plays the character for the remaining scenes filmed in the X-wing cockpit. Lawson also portrays Antilles in The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker. Lawson used his own voice in these films, masking his natural Scottish accent with an imitation of an American accent. Ankrum reprised his role as the voice of Wedge in Rogue One. Coincidentally, Denis Lawson is the maternal uncle of Ewan McGregor, who played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequel trilogy.  Appearances  = Films = Wedge appears towards the end of Star Wars as \\"Red Two\\", an X-wing pilot and a member of Red Squadron. His considerable dogfighting prowess is shown in the Battle of Yavin when he saves Luke Skywalker by shooting down a TIE fighter that Luke had been unable to shake off with a head-on, high deflection angle shot. Along with Luke and Biggs Darklighter, he is one of only three X-wing pilots to survive until the final attack runs along the Death Star's trench. However, his X-wing is damaged, and he is forced to disengage before the Death Star is destroyed. He and Luke are the only two X-Wing pilots to survive the battle, along with a Y-wing and the Millennium Falcon.Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004), disc 1. Wedge appears in The Empire Strikes Back as a member of the newly formed Rogue Squadron. He flies a snowspeeder under the callsign \\"Rogue Three\\" against the Empire's AT-AT ground assault with Wes Janson as his harpoon gunner. Their snowspeeder inflicts the first casualty against the AT-AT attack group by firing a harpoon trailing a tow cable into one of the walker's legs and circling the walker several times, causing it to trip and fall and allowing Rebel forces to destroy the walker. After the battle, Wedge is seen and heard wishing Luke a safe trip.Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004), disc 1. Wedge appears towards the end of Return of the Jedi as the leader of Red Squadron in the Battle of Endor. Along with Lando Calrissian, who pilots the Millennium Falcon with Nien Nunb, he leads the fighter attack on the second Death Star. His dogfighting prowess is shown again in this battle, as Wedge personally shoots down a number of Imperial TIE fighters, and appears to easily navigate the narrow and treacherous flight spaces inside the Death Star that lead to its core. When he and Lando reach the Death Star's core, Wedge destroys the power regulator on the core's north tower, while Lando destroys the core itself. He later appears at the victory celebration at the Ewok village on Endor.Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004), disc 1. Wedge appears, once again played by Denis Lawson, in the final installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, The Rise of Skywalker. He is seen manning a gun turret on the Millennium Falcon during the battle between the Resistance and the Sith Eternal, shortly after the death of his stepson Snap. Lawson had previously been asked to appear as Wedge in The Force Awakens, in the narrative role the character Poe Dameron was ultimately created for, but declined due to scheduling conflicts. Wedge is not seen on screen in the spinoff film Rogue One, but his voice is briefly heard over the intercom in the Rebel base on Yavin 4. He was intentionally omitted from the film's climactic battle in order to avoid a continuity error with the first Star Wars film, which takes place immediately after Rogue One. = Television = In the television series Star Wars Rebels, Wedge is voiced by Nathan Kress. He first appeared in the episode The Antilles Extraction, the fourth episode of the third season. The episode establishes Wedge's canon backstory as an Imperial TIE fighter pilot who with the help of Sabine Wren defected from the Empire, and joined the Rebel Alliance. Wedge later appeared in the episode \\"Double Agent Droid,\\" the nineteenth episode of the third season, and again in both parts of the third season finale Zero Hour, the twenty-first and twenty-second episodes, respectively. Wedge's last appearance in Rebels was in the first part of \\"In the Name of the Rebellion\\", the third episode of the fourth season. = Novels = Wedge is featured in the Star Wars: Aftermath trilogy by Chuck Wendig, consisting of the novels Aftermath (2015), Life Debt (2016), and Empire's End (2017). In this series, Wedge establishes a new unit called Phantom Squadron, which sees action on the planets Kashyyyk and Jakku. Following the Battle of Jakku, which ends the Galactic Civil War, Wedge relocates to Hosnian Prime, where he serves as a flight instructor. Wedge makes a brief appearance in Claudia Gray's 2015 novel Star Wars: Lost Stars, in which he recruits Thane Kyrell, one of the novel's protagonists, into the Rebel Alliance. Wedge later moves to the planet Akiva where he retires with Norra Wexley. The two appear in the 2019 novel Star Wars: Resistance Reborn where they join a Resistance mission to save some political prisoners on Corellia. =Legends= In April 2014, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded by Lucasfilm as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise. Wedge appears in the 1983 Marvel Star Wars comic \\"Hoth Stuff!\\", in which it is revealed that he went missing during the Battle of Hoth. Aboard his ship, Luke and Leia listen to his log tape recounting how he survived the Imperial invasion by hiding with Janson in the AT-AT Luke took down. They were prevented from contacting the Rebellion from orbiting TIE fighters and had to face wampas and other dangers. Janson was eventually killed by scavengers; Wedge then stole one of their ships to escape the planet and contact the Rebellion. He suddenly appears outside one of the windows, after working on the ship from space. Leia also states that Wedge and Luke grew up together on Tatooine, which Wedge seems to confirm in his log by mentioning a girlfriend he had there. Star Wars Legends literature explains that Wedge's parents were killed when their starship-refueling depot exploded. He piloted a freighter before joining the Rebel Alliance as a starfighter pilot. Wedge is the lead character in most of the Star Wars: X-Wing novels by Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston, set in the Star Wars expanded universe. Several Dark Horse Comics series focus on Wedge and Rogue Squadron, and the character also appears in other expanded universe works including the New Jedi Order and Legacy of the Force novels. Wedge is one of two main player characters in the Rogue Squadron video game series (Luke Skywalker is the other), and Wedge appears as a minor character in Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, helping the player during one mission. He is also a playable character in Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars. In popular culture *IGN named Wedge the 24th greatest Star Wars character of all time, claiming \\"Wedge Antilles may be the most important ancillary character in the Star Wars universe\\". *Wedge was portrayed by three voice actors in the Star Wars radio series from National Public Radio: Meshach Taylor in A New Hope, Don Scardino in The Empire Strikes Back, and Jon Matthews in Return of the Jedi. *Two characters named Biggs and Wedge appear frequently in RPGs made by Square.

Introduced in the original Star Wars film in 1977, Leia is princess of the planet Alderaan, a member of the Imperial Senate and an agent of the Rebel Alliance. She thwarts the sinister Sith lord Darth Vader and helps bring about the destruction of the Empire's cataclysmic superweapon, the Death Star. In The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Leia commands a Rebel base and evades Vader as she falls in love with the smuggler Han Solo. In Return of the Jedi (1983), Leia helps in the operation to rescue Han from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and is revealed to be Vader's daughter and the twin sister of Luke Skywalker. The prequel film Revenge of the Sith (2005) establishes that the twins' mother is Senator (and former queen) Padm√© Amidala of Naboo, who dies after childbirth. Leia is adopted by Senator Bail and Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan. In the sequel trilogy, Leia is the founder and General of the Resistance against the First Order. She and Han have a son named Ben Solo, who adopted the name Kylo Ren after turning to the dark side of the Force. In The Rise of Skywalker (2019), it is revealed that Leia was trained as a Jedi by her brother sometime after Return of the Jedi. In the film, Leia is the mentor of Rey, the last remaining Jedi. Leia dies towards the end of the film, but returns in the epilogue scene as a Force ghost alongside Luke. One of the more popular Star Wars characters, Leia has been called a 1980s icon, a feminist hero and model for other adventure heroines. She has appeared in many derivative works and merchandising, including the now-noncanonical Star Wars Expanded Universe, and has been referenced or parodied in several TV shows and films. Her 'cinnamon bun' hairstyle from Star Wars (1977) and metal bikini from Return of the Jedi have become cultural icons. Fisher was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actress twice for A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. Fisher later received two Saturn Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress, the first for The Force Awakens and the second being a posthumous nomination for The Last Jedi. Creation and casting Leia was created by Star Wars creator George Lucas, who in 1999 explained his early development of the main characters: In the rough draft of Star Wars, Leia is the spoiled teenage daughter of King Kayos and Queen Breha of Aquilae, with two brothers, Biggs and Windy; Biggs returned to the fourth draft as a childhood friend of Luke. Leia was at one point \\"the daughter of Owen Lars and his wife Beru ... Luke's cousin‚Äìtogether they visit the grave of his mother, who perished with his father on a planet destroyed by the Death Star.\\" A later story synopsis establishes Leia as \\"Leia Antilles\\", the daughter of Bail Antilles from the peaceful world of Organa Major. In the fourth draft it was established that \\"Leia Organa\\" came instead from Alderaan. Fisher was 19 when she was cast as Princess Leia, with actresses including Amy Irving, Cindy Williams and Jodie Foster also up for the role. In 2014, InkTank reported that the extended list of \\"more than two dozen actresses\\" who had auditioned for Leia included Glenn Close, Farrah Fawcett, Jessica Lange, Sissy Spacek, Sigourney Weaver, Cybill Shepherd, Jane Seymour, Anjelica Huston, Kim Basinger, Kathleen Turner, Geena Davis, Meryl Streep, and Terri Nunn.. Asked about Streep in 2015, Fisher said, \\"I've never heard that one. But Jodie Foster was up for it... that one I knew the most. Amy Irving and Jodie. And I got it.\\" Hopi girl with \\"squash blossom\\" hairdo (1922) On Leia's 'cinnamon bun' hairstyle, George Lucas stated that \\"In the 1977 film, I was working very hard to create something different that wasn't fashion, so I went with a kind of Southwestern Pancho Villa woman revolutionary look. ... The buns are basically from turn-of-the-century Mexico.\\" Lucas later noted that Leia's mother, Padm√© Amidala, wears a similar-looking Hopi hairstyle in Revenge of the Sith. A photo depicting famous Mexican revolutionary Clara de la Rocha wearing a similar hairstyle exists in the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art archives. In 2015, Mental Floss cited research suggesting that while female Mexican revolutionaries did not have such elaborate hairstyles, young marriageable Hopi women did, and their \\"squash blossom whorls\\" superficially resemble Leia's hair buns. Leia's hairstyle may have also been inspired by that of Queen Fria in the 1939 Flash Gordon comic strip \\"The Ice Kingdom of Mongo\\", and scientist Barnes Wallis' wife Molly (played by Ursula Jeans) in the 1955 war film The Dam Busters. Comparisons have also been made to the 4th- century-BC Iberian sculpture Lady of Elche, as well as the 1920s \\"earphones\\" hairstyle. Composer John Williams created a musical leitmotif for Leia which recurs throughout the Star Wars saga. \\"Princess Leia's Theme\\" was recorded as a concert suite (4:18 length) for the score of the 1977 film. The second draft of the Return of the Jedi screenplay contained dialogue in which Obi-Wan tells Luke he has a twin sister. She and their mother were \\"sent to the protection of friends in a distant system. The mother died shortly thereafter, and Luke's sister was adopted by Ben's friends, the governor of Alderaan and his wife.\\" Fisher explained in 1983: \\"Leia's real father left her mother when she was pregnant, so her mother married this King Organa. I was adopted and grew up set apart from other people because I was a princess.\\" Character Anthony Breznican of Entertainment Weekly describes Leia as a \\"diplomat, spy, warrior, undercover agent\\". Mark Edlitz calls her \\"a smart, feisty, brave diplomat and warrior\\" in The Huffington Post. Fisher told Rolling Stone in 1983: She said in 2014: Appearances =Skywalker saga= Original trilogy =A New Hope= Princess Leia's white gown from the original Star Wars film Introduced in the original 1977 film Star Wars, Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan is a member of the Imperial Senate. She is captured by Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) on board the ship Tantive IV, where she is acting as a spy for the Rebel Alliance. Leia has secretly hidden the blueprints for the Death Star, the Empire's moon-sized battle station, inside the astromech droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and has sent it to find one of the last remaining Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), on the nearby planet of Tatooine. Vader arrests Leia and has her tortured, but she resists revealing anything. Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) threatens to destroy her home planet Alderaan with the Death Star unless she reveals the location of the hidden Rebel base. She provides the location of an old, abandoned base on the planet Dantooine, but Tarkin orders Alderaan to be destroyed anyway. Leia is rescued by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and they escape aboard Han's ship, the Millennium Falcon. After analyzing the Death Star's schematics, the Rebels find a tiny weakness in the battle station, which Luke uses to destroy it in his X-wing fighter. In the aftermath of the victory, Leia bestows medals on the heroes at the hidden Rebel base on Yavin 4. Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post writes of Leia in the film: Rosenberg also notes that, though Han is almost immediately attracted to Leia, they conflict because she insists on asserting command and he automatically resists, even as she proves herself to be worthy of it. And despite her initial disdain for the smuggler, whom she sees as selfish, Leia later acknowledges \\"I knew there was more to you than money\\" when Han comes through for the Rebellion. Fisher told Rolling Stone in 1980 that in the original script, when Luke and Han come to rescue a captured Leia, \\"I was hanging upside down with yellow eyes, like in The Exorcist ... Some form of radar torture was done to me and I was in a beam, bruised and beaten up, suspended in midair. The reason it was cut from the film was because I was unconscious and the Wookiee would have had to carry me for, like, the next fifteen minutes.\\" =The Empire Strikes Back= In The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Leia is at the Rebel base on Hoth. She leads its evacuation during an Imperial attack, and then flees with Han, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) on the Millennium Falcon. They dodge pursuing Imperial TIE fighters by flying into an asteroid field when the Falcon hyperdrive breaks down, with Leia piloting the ship at one point. Romance blossoms between Leia and Han during their flight from the Empire; while hiding in the stomach of a space slug, they finally share a kiss. With his ship needing repairs, Han seeks out his old friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) in Cloud City, the floating city over Bespin. Though he welcomes them graciously, Lando soon turns them over to a newly arrived Darth Vader, who hopes to use them as bait to capture Luke. Leia confesses her love for Han as he is frozen in carbonite and then handed over to bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch), who is charged with bringing him to the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Lando helps Leia, Chewbacca and the two droids escape. Leia senses that Luke is in trouble, and goes back to save him after he is nearly killed during a lightsaber duel and confrontation with Vader. Rosenberg notes: =Return of the Jedi= In Return of the Jedi (1983), Leia infiltrates Jabba the Hutt's palace on Tatooine disguised as the Ubese bounty hunter Boushh, and brings a captive Chewbacca with her as part of the ruse. She frees Han from the carbonite, but they are recaptured by Jabba. Leia is now chained to Jabba as his slave, outfitted in a metal bikini. After Luke arrives and kills Jabba's Rancor, Jabba sentences Luke, Han and Chewbacca to be fed to the Sarlacc. Lando (disguised as a guard) helps them overpower their captors, and Leia seizes the moment to strangle Jabba with her chain. Luke and Leia swing to safety, blowing up Jabba's barge behind them. Later, the heroes go to the forest moon of Endor to prepare for a battle with the Empire. There, Luke reveals to Leia that she is his twin sister and that Vader is their father. Leia joins Han in leading the Rebels in battle with Imperial troops as the Rebel Fleet attacks the second Death Star. Leia is slightly injured, but the Rebels, with help from the Ewoks, ultimately defeat the forces of the Empire, with the Death Star destroyed once more. Fisher told Rolling Stone in 1983, \\"In Return of the Jedi, [Leia] gets to be more feminine, more supportive, more affectionate. But let's not forget that these movies are basically boys' fantasies. So the other way they made her more female in this one was to have her take off her clothes.\\" Rosenberg writes of Han and Leia: In the film, Leia says that she has vague memories of her real mother, who she describes as \\"kind... but sad\\". Bouzereau quoted Lucas in 1997: Prequel trilogy =Revenge of the Sith= In the prequel film Revenge of the Sith (2005), Padm√© Amidala (Natalie Portman) is pregnant with Anakin Skywalker's (Hayden Christensen) twins near the end of the Clone Wars. After Anakin turns to the dark side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader, Padm√© gives birth to Luke and Leia on Polis Massa and then dies. Leia is adopted by Senator Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) and his wife Queen Breha (Rebecca Jackson Mendoza) of Alderaan. Film critic Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, \\"As we watch Anakin nearly melt in the lava, only to be put together, Frankenstein style, in a lab while Lucas intercuts scenes of Padme giving birth to the twins Luke and Leia, a link to genuine feeling is established at last.\\" Sequel trilogy =The Force Awakens= right In March 2013, Fisher confirmed that she would reprise her role as Leia in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Set 30 years after Return of the Jedi, The Force Awakens reintroduces a Leia who is \\"a little more battle weary, a little more broken hearted\\". In November 2015, director J.J. Abrams said of Leia, \\"She's referred to as General but ... there's a moment in the movie where a character sort of slips and calls her 'Princess.'\\" Commenting on the story he added, \\"The stakes are pretty high in the story for her, so there's not much goofing around where Leia's concerned.\\" Asked how Leia is handling things in the film, Fisher said, \\"Not easily ... [she is] solitary. Under a lot of pressure. Committed as ever to her cause, but I would imagine feeling somewhat defeated, tired, and pissed.\\" In the film, Leia is the leader of the Resistance, a group formed by the New Republic to fight a proxy war with the First Order (a group formed by the remnants of the Empire) and trying to find Luke, who disappeared years earlier. When her forces foil a First Order attack searching for the Resistance astromech droid BB-8, Leia is reunited with Han, who has helped the renegade stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and orphaned scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) bring the droid this far. Han and Leia have been estranged for many years; their marriage fell apart after their son, Ben Solo (Adam Driver), fell to the dark side and became the First Order commander Kylo Ren. Leia believes Ben can still be brought back to the light side. Han volunteers for a mission to infiltrate the First Order's Starkiller Base to disable its defensive shields. Confronting Ren, Han tries to convince his son to leave the First Order, but Ren instead impales his father on his lightsaber. Leia senses Han's death through the Force, and later shares a moment of grief with Rey, who had thought of Han as a mentor and father figure. Leia sees Rey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 off when they depart to locate Luke, saying, \\"may the Force be with you\\". Asked why Leia is not shown to be a Jedi in The Force Awakens (as she is in the Star Wars Expanded Universe works), Abrams told IGN, \\"It was a great question, and one that we talked about quite a bit, even with Carrie [Fisher]. Why did she not take advantage of this natural Force strength that this character had. And one of the answers was that it was simply a choice that she made, that her decision to run the Rebellion, and ultimately this Resistance, and consider herself a General, as opposed to a Jedi. It was simply a choice that she took\\". He also added, \\"I would like to think that there really isn't much of a ticking clock, and it's never too late ... clearly we've seen, and we do again, that she still is Force strong. And it's something that I think is an intrinsic piece of her character. Fisher was nominated for a 2016 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal. =The Last Jedi= In December 2015, producer Kathleen Kennedy confirmed that Fisher would reprise the role of Leia in the next installment, then known as Star Wars: Episode VIII, but later named Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Fisher died on December 27, 2016, after going into cardiac arrest. It was confirmed that she had completed filming her role in the film shortly before her death. In the film, Leia is among those on the bridge of her flagship, the Raddus, who are expelled into space when the ship is attacked by the First Order. Leia uses the Force to pull herself back to the ship. After recovering, she shoots and stuns Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), who has mutinied against her successor, Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern). From his solitude on Ahch-To, Luke projects himself through the Force to the Resistance stronghold on Crait and reunites with Leia, apologizing for what happened to Ben. Leia replies that she knows her son is gone, but Luke reassures her that \\"no one's ever really gone\\". While Luke distracts Kylo and his attacking First Order troops, Leia is among the remaining Resistance forces who escape from Crait in the Millennium Falcon. =The Rise of Skywalker= Following Fisher's death, Variety reported that she was slated to appear in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and speculated that Lucasfilm would need to find a way to address her death and what would become of her character. Filming began on August 1, 2018. Lucasfilm announced in January 2017 that they had \\"no plans to digitally recreate Carrie Fisher's performance as Princess or General Leia Organa\\". In April 2017, Fisher's family granted Disney and Lucasfilm the rights to use recent footage of the late actress in The Rise of Skywalker. However, Kennedy subsequently said that Fisher would not appear in the film. In July 2018, it was announced that Fisher would appear as Leia in The Rise of Skywalker, using unseen footage from The Force Awakens. Initially, there had also been plans to use additional unseen footage of Leia from The Last Jedi, but it was ultimately not included in the ninth film. Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd, who portrayed Lieutenant Connix in all three sequel trilogy films, also stepped in as Leia for a brief flashback in the film in which her face was digitally replaced by Fisher's likeness, using imagery from Return of the Jedi. In the film, Leia continues to lead the Resistance while offering guidance and support to Rey as she continues her training to become a Jedi. A flashback reveals that Leia had abandoned her own training after she had a vision foretelling her son's death if she finished. While Rey and Ren duel on Kef Bir, a dying Leia uses all of her remaining strength to reach out to her son. Distracted after sensing his mother's death, Ren is stabbed by Rey with his own lightsaber. Leia passes away, making Rey experience overwhelming guilt. Rey heals Ren's wound using the Force. After the Battle of Exegol, a redeemed Ben Solo sacrifices the remainder of his life force to resurrect a dead Rey, and he vanishes at the same time as Leia becomes one with the Force. Rey then returns to the Lars homestead on Tatooine and buries the lightsabers that had belonged to Leia and her father, Anakin Skywalker as the spirits of Luke and Leia look on with pride, with Rey honoring them by adopting the surname \\"Skywalker\\". =Anthology films= Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Leia makes a brief appearance in the final scene of the 2016 film Rogue One, receiving the plans for the Death Star as a lead-up to the beginning of A New Hope. Since this movie takes place prior to the original Star Wars trilogy, a very young Leia was required. To achieve that effect, a computer-generated image of a young Carrie Fisher was superimposed over Norwegian actress Ingvild Deila's face; archival audio of Fisher saying \\"Hope\\" was used to voice the character. =Television= Leia appears briefly in 1978's Star Wars Holiday Special television film as a leader and administrator of the new Rebel Alliance base. She and C-3PO contact Chewbacca's wife Mallatobuck for assistance in finding Chewbacca and Han. Leia also appears in the cartoon segment at a different Rebel Base, located in an asteroid field, and at the Life Day ceremony at the end of the film. Fisher also appeared in and hosted the November 18, 1978, episode of Saturday Night Live that aired one day after the holiday special. Star Wars Rebels A teenage version of Princess Leia, voiced by Julie Dolan, appears in a 2016 episode of the animated series Star Wars Rebels, which is set between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. In the episode, Leia is sent on a secret mission to assist the titular rebels. Executive producer Dave Filoni said of the appearance: Star Wars Forces of Destiny Leia appears in the animated series Star Wars Forces of Destiny, voiced by Shelby Young. Star Wars Resistance Leia appears in the animated series Star Wars Resistance, voiced by Rachel Butera and Carolyn Hennesy. =Novels= Leia makes her first literary appearance in Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker, the novelization of the original 1977 film Star Wars, which was released six months before the film in November 1976. Credited to Lucas but ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster, the novel was based on Lucas' screenplay. Leia later appeared in the novelizations The Empire Strikes Back (1980) by Donald F. Glut and Return of the Jedi (1983) by James Kahn. She is also a point-of-view character in the 2015 novelization of The Force Awakens by Foster. Foster's 1978 novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye was commissioned by Lucas as the basis for a potential low-budget sequel to Star Wars should the film prove unsuccessful. In the story, Luke and Leia seek a crystal on a swampy planet and eventually face Vader in combat. Leia also appears in the Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens line of novels and comic books, introduced in conjunction with The Force Awakens to connect the film with previous installments. She is the lead character in the young adult novel Moving Target: A Princess Leia Adventure (2015) by Cecil Castellucci and Jason Fry, which is set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, and Claudia Gray's novels Star Wars: Bloodline (2016) and Leia: Princess of Alderaan (2017). The former is set six years before The Force Awakens, while the latter features a 16-year-old Leia before the events of A New Hope. =Comics= Leia is the lead character in the five-part comic limited series Star Wars: Princess Leia (2015), taking place immediately after Episode IV: A New Hope. She is also featured prominently in the four-part comic limited series Star Wars: Shattered Empire (2015), set immediately after Return of the Jedi. Princess Leia reveals Leia to have had royal training in martial arts and explores her reaction to the destruction of Alderaan, while Shattered Empire portrays her as a skilled pilot who undertakes a dangerous mission alongside Poe Dameron's mother. In Princess Leia and Shattered Empire, Leia senses the past while on Naboo (briefly envisioning her mother and Darth Maul, respectively), and in Star Wars #12, she uses a lightsaber as a weapon for the first time canonically. =Legends works= The original three Star Wars films have spawned a large franchise of works that include novels, comic books, and video games. Leia appears in much of this material. In April 2014 (with the sequel film The Force Awakens in production), Lucasfilm excluded the Star Wars Expanded Universe from official Star Wars canon, rebranding it as Star Wars Legends. In this continuity, Leia continues her adventures with Han and Luke after Return of the Jedi, fighting Imperial resurgences and new threats to the galaxy. She becomes the Chief of State of the New Republic and a Jedi master, and is the mother to three children by Han: Jaina, Jacen and Anakin Solo. Novels The 1991 New York Times bestselling novel Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn began what would become a large collection of works set before, between and especially after the original films. =Post-Return of the Jedi= The bestselling Thrawn trilogy (1991‚Äì93) by Timothy Zahn begins five years after the events of Return of the Jedi. In Heir to the Empire (1991), Leia is married to Han and three months pregnant with twins. Noghri commandos repeatedly attempt to kidnap her as part of Grand Admiral Thrawn's plan to restore the Empire and crush the New Republic. In Dark Force Rising (1992), Leia realizes that Darth Vader and the Empire deceived the Noghri to secure their allegiance, and by revealing the truth she turns the alien race to the side of the New Republic. At one point, she remembers her adoptive parents on Alderaan, implying that the \\"mother\\" she discussed with Luke on Endor was Queen Breha. In The Last Command (1993), Leia gives birth to the twins Jaina and Jacen Solo on Coruscant during Thrawn's siege. Leia, now the Chief of State of the New Republic, is a minor character in the Jedi Academy trilogy (1994) by Kevin J. Anderson, set after the Thrawn trilogy. Next in the timeline is the Callista trilogy: Children of the Jedi (1995) by Barbara Hambly, Darksaber (1995) by Anderson and Planet of Twilight (1997) by Hambly. In The Crystal Star (1994) by Vonda McIntyre, young Jacen, Jaina and their three-year-old brother Anakin are kidnapped in a plot to restore the Empire, but are rescued by Leia and Chewbacca. Leia struggles with the responsibilities of her position in The Black Fleet Crisis trilogy (1996) by Michael P. Kube-McDowell. In The New Rebellion (1996) by Kristine Kathryn Rusch, she avoids an assassination attempt and then aids in the defeat of the Dark Jedi Kueller, whom she shoots to death. The Corellian trilogy (1995) by Roger MacBride Allen finds Han and Leia swept up in a civil war while visiting his homeworld of Corellia with their children. In the two Hand of Thrawn novels by Timothy Zahn (1997's Specter of the Past and 1998's Vision of the Future), Leia tries to hold the New Republic together as Moff Disra conspires for its volatile factions to destroy each other. Leia appears periodically in the Young Jedi Knights series (1995‚Äì98) by Kevin J. Anderson and Rebecca Moesta. The 14-volume young adult fiction series covers the Jedi training of Jacen and Jaina. In The Truce at Bakura (1993) by Kathy Tyers, set one day after the ending of Return of the Jedi, Leia establishes New Alderaan, a sanctuary for the destroyed planet's surviving inhabitants. The spirit of Anakin Skywalker appears to Leia and pleads for her forgiveness, but she angrily banishes him. The six-volume Jedi Prince series (1992‚Äì93) by Paul Davids and Hollace Davids, later contradicted by other novels, is set within a year after Return of the Jedi. In The Glove of Darth Vader (1992), the self- proclaimed son of the defeated Emperor Palpatine, Trioculus, seeks the titular glove to cement himself as the new Emperor. Entranced by Leia's beauty in The Lost City of the Jedi (1992), Trioculus vows to make her his queen. He captures her in Zorba the Hutt's Revenge (1992), but Jabba the Hutt's vengeful father, Zorba, offers to trade his own prisoner Ken‚ÄîPalpatine's real grandson whom Trioculus has been seeking‚Äîfor Leia, his son's killer. But Leia and Ken are rescued and Trioculus is frozen in carbonate by Zorba. Mission from Mount Yoda (1993) finds Ken's father Triclops alive and willing to join the Rebels against the Empire. Leia, now engaged to Han, is captured by Zorba in Queen of the Empire (1993). Trioculus is revived and seizes Leia before Zorba can kill her. Leia is rescued and replaced with a lookalike droid decoy, which kills Trioculus. In Prophets of the Dark Side (1993), Leia looks forward to her wedding to Han and has a vision of their two children. Matthew Stover's 2008 standalone novel Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor picks up the story soon after, as Luke, Leia and the Rebels fight the Sith Lord Shadowspawn. In The Courtship of Princess Leia (1994) by Dave Wolverton, set immediately before the Thrawn trilogy, Leia is presented with an advantageous political marriage to Prince Isolder of the planet Hapes. A jealous Han abducts Leia and takes her to the planet Dathomir; Luke and Isolder follow, and there they all find the hidden forces of the Imperial warlord Zsinj. Defeating him, Han and Leia marry. The 2003 novels A Forest Apart and Tatooine Ghost by Troy Denning are set immediately after The Courtship of Princess Leia. The newly married Leia fears that any children she has may succumb to the dark side like her father. During an adventure on Tatooine in Tatooine Ghost, she discovers the diary of her grandmother Shmi Skywalker and meets some of young Anakin's childhood friends. When she learns of Anakin's childhood as a slave and the traumatic death of his mother, Leia learns to forgive her father. =Works set between films= In Shadows of the Empire (1996) by Steve Perry, the only Star Wars novel set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Leia is searching for Boba Fett to find a captive Han. She is bewitched by the crime lord Prince Xizor using pheromones, but Chewbacca helps her elude the seduction. Allegiance (2007) and Choices of One (2011) by Timothy Zahn are set between Star Wars: A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, and feature Leia and her cohorts seeking new allies for their Rebellion against the Empire. Razor's Edge (2013) by Martha Wells and Honor Among Thieves (2014) by James S. A. Corey take place in the same time period and also chronicle the adventures of Leia and Han. =New Jedi Order= In the New Jedi Order series (1999‚Äì2003), Leia resigns as Chief of State, and on the heels of her warnings before the Senate, the alien Yuuzhan Vong invade the galaxy. They destroy system after system and defeat both the Jedi and the New Republic forces in countless battles. Chewbacca dies in Vector Prime (1999) by R.A. Salvatore, which sends Han into a deep depression that causes a rift between him and Leia. They reunite after Leia is gravely wounded at the Battle of Duro in Kathy Tyers' Balance Point (2000). She is targeted by a deadly Voxyn slayer in Troy Dennings' Star By Star (2001), and though she manages to evade death, her son Anakin is later killed during a mission to prevent more Voxyn from being cloned. The Vong are finally defeated in The Unifying Force (2003) by James Luceno. In Denning's The Dark Nest trilogy (2005), Leia, Han and several Jedi become involved in an escalating border dispute between the Chiss and the insidious insectoid Killiks, and Leia makes a bitter enemy in the Twi'lek warrior Alema Rar. In The Joiner King (2005), Leia asks Saba Sebatyne to train her as a Jedi Knight. R2-D2 malfunctions in The Unseen Queen (2005) and shows Luke a holoclip of his father Anakin and a pregnant woman, whom Luke learns is his and Leia's biological mother, Padm√© Amidala. Anakin and Padm√© are discussing a dream of Anakin's in which Padm√© dies in childbirth; later, Luke and Leia watch a clip in which Padm√© is talking to Obi-Wan Kenobi about Anakin. Tenel Ka, Queen Mother of the Hapes Consortium, has a daughter, Allana, secretly fathered by Jacen. In The Swarm War (2005), Luke and Leia view holoclips of their mother's death, and Leia is promoted to Jedi Knight. =Legacy of the Force= The bestselling Legacy of the Force series (2006‚Äì08) chronicles the crossover of Han and Leia's son Jacen to the dark side of the Force while the Jedi, Solos and Skywalkers fight against his growing power. In Betrayal (2006) by Aaron Allston, Jacen turns to the dark side, believing that it is the only way to save the galaxy from the chaos brewing among the member systems of the Galactic Alliance. Jacen realizes in Bloodlines (2006) by Karen Traviss that the Sith discipline will require him to kill one of his loved ones, which he decides is an acceptable sacrifice to save the galaxy. In Troy Denning's Tempest (2006), Han and Leia thwart the assassination of Tenel Ka and Allana, but become caught up in a Corellian conspiracy. They are almost killed when the Millennium Falcon is attacked by a Star Destroyer controlled by an increasingly powerful Jacen‚Äîwho knows that his parents are on board. With Han injured, Leia and Lando further investigate the Corellians in Aaron Allston's Exile (2007), but Alema reappears to exact her vengeance on Leia. Sacrifice (2007) by Karen Traviss finds Leia and Han on the run, hunted by Jacen as traitors to the Galactic Alliance. He kills Luke's wife Mara Jade as his final sacrifice to become Darth Caedus, the new ruler of the Sith. In Inferno (2007) by Troy Denning, Han and Leia are faced with the reality that their son, now Joint Chief of State, is the enemy. Leia attempts unsuccessfully to manipulate Jacen in Aaron Allston's Fury (2007) so that the Jedi can both thwart him and neutralize Alema. Finally, in Invincible (2008) by Troy Denning, Jaina kills Jacen in a lightsaber duel. At Tenel Ka's request, Leia and Han adopt Allana, disguised with the name \\"Amelia\\" to protect her from any future vengeance against Cadeus or the Hapes Consortium. Multiple novels in the series made the New York Times Best Seller list. The nine-volume Fate of the Jedi series (2009‚Äì12) by Aaron Allston, Troy Denning and Christie Golden finds Han and Leia become caught up in the intensifying conflict between the Galactic Alliance and the Jedi. In the wake of Darth Cadeus' death, the now-peaceful Galactic Alliance harbors a growing mistrust toward the Jedi, and the situation is worsened by a Force-induced psychosis that begins afflicting individual Jedi, sending them on violent rampages. In Millennium Falcon (2008) by James Luceno, set between Legacy of the Force and Fate of the Jedi, a mysterious device hidden inside the eponymous spacecraft sends Han, Leia and Allana on an adventure to investigate the ship's past before it came into Han's possession. Troy Denning's Crucible (2013), set after Fate of the Jedi and the last novel to date in the Star Wars Legends chronology, reunites Leia, Han and Luke with Lando as they aid him to thwart a vast criminal enterprise threatening his asteroid mineral refinery in the Chilean Rift nebula. Comics Leia's youth is depicted in the non-canon Star Wars Tales story, The Princess Leia Diaries. In it, she develops her disdain for the Empire, as well as a conflict with Tarkin. She discovers and decides to support the Rebellion. =Dark Empire= During the events of the comic series Dark Empire (1991‚Äì92), Palpatine has been resurrected in a young clone body and seduces Luke to the dark side of the Force as part of his plan to restore the Empire. A captive Leia, resisting Palpatine's attempts to turn her as well, escapes with an artifact he needs to secure his power, the Jedi Holocron. Luke pursues her, and Leia manages to turn him back. Brother and sister then fight Palpatine with the light side of the Force, turning his own Force-generated storm against him and destroying Palpatine and his Star Destroyer. In Dark Empire II (1994‚Äì95), Leia gives birth to a third child by Han, whom she names Anakin. Palpatine is reborn in an inferior, rapidly deteriorating clone body in Empire's End (1995), and seeks to possess the body of the infant Anakin. Cultural impact Princess Leia right Princess Leia has been called a 1980s icon, a feminist hero and \\"an exemplary personification of female empowerment\\". In 2008, Leia was selected by Empire magazine as the 89th greatest film character of all time, and IGN listed her as their 8th top Star Wars hero. UGO Networks listed Leia as one of their best heroes of all time in 2010. The character has been referenced or parodied in several TV shows and films, and celebrated in cosplay. Fisher appeared in the Leia metal bikini on the cover of the Summer 1983 issue of Rolling Stone, and a painting of Leia and other characters surrounding Lucas appeared on the cover of the May 25, 1983 issue of Time announcing Return of the Jedi. In 2013, cartoonist Jeffrey Brown published the bestselling Star Wars: Vader's Little Princess, a comic strip-style book featuring Darth Vader and a young Leia in humorous father-daughter situations. Princess Leia appears on a 2007 US postage stamp and a 2015 UK stamp. Leia has also been used in a wide range of Star Wars merchandise, including statuettes, action figures and other toys, household items and clothing, office supplies, food products, and bubble bath and shampoo in Leia-shaped bottles with her head as the cap. In her one-woman show Wishful Drinking, Fisher called the Princess Leia Pez dispenser one of the \\"merchandising horrors\\" of the series. In a 2011 interview, Fisher said: After the 2012 acquisition of LucasFilm by the Walt Disney Company, the Disney Store stated in May 2014 that the company had \\"no plans for Leia products\\". After public criticism, Disney told Time in June 2014 that it would be releasing several Leia products. Funko has since produced several versions of Leia (at least one for each film) in their POP! line of 4.5-inch vinyl figures in the Japanese super deformed style. Hasbro is set to release an action figure of Leia as she appears in the Star Wars Rebels animated series. =\\"Cinnamon buns\\" hairstyle= Leia's unique hairdo in 1977's A New Hope has come to be known as the \\"doughnut\\" or \\"cinnamon buns\\" hairstyle, and is iconic of the character and series. A February 1978 cover story for the British teen magazine Jackie included step-by-step instructions on how to replicate Leia's hair buns. In the 1978 short film parody Hardware Wars, Princess Anne-Droid has actual cinnamon buns on the side of her head. Miss Piggy of The Muppet Show copied the hairdo in a Star Wars-themed episode of the series in February 1980. In the 1987 Mel Brooks comedy film Spaceballs, Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) appears to have the hairstyle, which is soon revealed to in fact be a large pair of headphones. In the parody film Thumb Wars, the role of Leia was filled by a character named Princess Bunhead, who has two cinnamon rolls for hair. In 2015, Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd's character in the horror-comedy TV series Scream Queens, a rich and disaffected sorority girl known as Chanel No. 3, wears earmuffs in every scene as an homage to Fisher's iconic Leia hairstyle. Lourd also has a cameo in The Force Awakens (2015) in which she wears Leia's distinctive hair buns. =Feminist analysis= Leia has been the subject of feminist analysis. Mark Edlitz wrote for The Huffington Post in 2010 that \\"Leia is an exemplary personification of female empowerment.\\" David Bushman, television curator at the Paley Center for Media, said in 2012, \\"From the male perspective ... Princess Leia was a very creditable character for her time‚Äînot perfect, but certainly defiant, assertive, and strong.\\" Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post wrote in 2015, \\"Leia wasn't just the first great heroine of science fiction and fantasy to capture my imagination. She was one of the first characters I encountered whose power came from her political conviction and acumen.\\" In her 2007 article \\"Feminism and the Force: Empowerment and Disillusionment in a Galaxy Far, Far Away\\", Diana Dominguez cited Leia as a welcome change from the previous portrayals of women in film and TV. She wrote: Rosenberg writes that, though at first Luke is an apolitical innocent in search of adventure and Han is a detached opportunist in search of money, both are \\"influenced by Leia's passion [and] take their places as full participants in the Rebellion\\". She notes, \\"Everyone else eventually comes around to Leia's view of the world.\\" Leia herself, singularly dedicated to her political movement against the Empire, \\"finds a partner in Han, acknowledging that personal happiness can help her sustain her commitment to building a better galactic order\\". Rosenberg cites \\"Leia's willingness to see the best in him, and Han's desire to live up to her belief in him\\" as a foundation of their relationship, also pointing out his attempts to make her recognize that she has needs like anyone else and should acknowledge that she needs him. In their 2012 essay \\"Lightsabers, Political Arenas, and Marriages\\", Ray Merlock and Kathy Merlock Jackson cite Leia as the successor of earlier science fiction heroines Wilma Deering of Buck Rogers and Dale Arden of Flash Gordon, and the embodiment of \\"a new stage in the ongoing presentation of the fairy-tale princess in jeopardy\\". Writing that \\"after Leia, no longer would princesses be passive and salvaged simply with a kiss,\\" they note the reflection of the character in later Disney Princess animated films and in woman warriors such as Ellen Ripley from the Alien franchise and Xena of the adventure TV series Xena: Warrior Princess. A. O. Scott of The New York Times described Leia as \\"a foremother of Hermione Granger and Katniss Everdeen and of countless latter-day Disney princesses. She also foretold the recent, somewhat belated feminist turn in the Star Wars cycle itself\\". Mark Hamill described Fisher's performance as: Fisher herself described Leia as a \\"huge\\" feminist icon, dismissing the suggestion that the character was ever a \\"damsel in distress\\". Fisher said of Leia, \\"She bossed them around. I don't know what your idea of distress is, but that wasn't it! And I wasn't some babe running through the galaxy with my tits bouncing around. So I wasn't threatening to women\\". She added, \\"I like Princess Leia. I like how she was feisty. I like how she killed Jabba the Hutt\\". \\"I think I am Princess Leia, and Princess Leia is me. It's like a moebius striptease.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuhxUwK6kYA =Metal bikini= Princess Leia's slave costume from Episode VI Leia's slave costume when she is held captive by Jabba the Hutt at the beginning of Return of the Jedi‚Äîmade of brass and dubbed Leia's \\"Metal Bikini\\" or \\"Gold Bikini\\"‚Äîimmediately made the character (and Fisher) a \\"generational sex symbol\\" celebrated by pin-up posters, and later merchandising and cosplay. The outfit has gained a cult following of its own. Rosenberg noted that \\"the costume has become culturally iconic in a way that has slipped loose from the context of the scenes in which Leia wore it and the things she does after she is forced into the outfit.\\" Wired wrote in 2006, \\"There's no doubt that the sight of Carrie Fisher in the gold sci-fi swimsuit was burned into the sweaty subconscious of a generation of fanboys hitting puberty in the spring of 1983.\\" Acknowledging the opinion of some that the \\"Slave Leia\\" iconography tarnishes the character's position as \\"feminist hero\\", Rosenberg argues: Science fiction filmmaker Letia Clouston concurs, saying \\"Sci-fi has had a long history of strong female characters. Yes, Princess Leia was in a gold bikini, but she was also the one who single- handedly killed Jabba.

In The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Lando is introduced as an old friend of Han Solo. Prior to the events of the film, Lando made a career as a gambler, con artist, playboy, mining engineer, businessman, and was the owner of the Millennium Falcon until losing the ship to Han in a bet. He has become the administrator of Cloud City on the gas planet Bespin, and in the film, reluctantly betrays Han to Darth Vader. In Return of the Jedi (1983), he helps rescue Han from Jabba the Hutt and becomes a general in the Rebel Alliance and leads the attack on the second Death Star. He is portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the original trilogy, as well as The Rise of Skywalker (2019), marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history. Donald Glover portrayed a younger version of the character in the standalone Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018). Lando also appears frequently in the Star Wars Expanded Universe of novels, comic books and video games, including a series of Legends novels. The character has become one of the franchise's most popular, with Billy Dee Williams' performance receiving praise. Donald Glover's performance in Solo was also well received, being hailed as one of the film's highlights. Williams was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor twice for his performances in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Appearances =Film= Lando is portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi (1983), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019), and was played by Donald Glover in the film Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018). Original trilogy Lando Calrissian first appears in The Empire Strikes Back as the administrator of Cloud City, an old friend of Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and the previous owner of Han's ship, the Millennium Falcon. When Han, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) arrive at Cloud City, Lando welcomes them as guests of honor - only to betray them to Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), who plans to use them as bait to ensnare Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Lando had reluctantly agreed to betray Han and company after Vader threatened to put Cloud City under the Galactic Empire's control if he refused. Lando allows Vader to freeze Han in carbonite and give him to bounty hunter Boba Fett) (Jeremy Bulloch); when Vader takes Leia and Chewbacca prisoner, however, Lando's conscience gets the better of him and he helps them escape. In the ensuing evacuation of Cloud City, he helps them escape in the Falcon. He later assists in rescuing Luke from the underside of Cloud City. Afterwards, he promises to help find Han. In Return of the Jedi, Lando goes undercover to help Luke rescue Han from crime lord Jabba the Hutt. During a battle with Jabba's henchmen, Han saves Lando from being devoured by the Sarlacc; Lando then helps Han and the others destroy Jabba's barge. For his heroics, he is made a general in the Rebel Alliance. Lando then takes the pilot chair in his old ship, the Millennium Falcon, and leads the attack on the second Death Star. He leads the Rebel strike on the battle station, and personally destroys its power core, causing the station to explode. He then joins the other Rebels on Endor in celebrating their victory and the end of the Empire. Sequel trilogy Lando did not appear in the first film of the sequel trilogy, The Force Awakens (2015). According to Williams, the reason Lando did not return may have been that he did not fit into the storyline. His absence from the casting announcement caused the displeasure of some fans. Lando was also absent from The Last Jedi (2017). During the early development of the film, director Rian Johnson briefly considered bringing back Lando as the codebreaker that Resistance members Finn (John Boyega) and Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) seek in the coastal city of Canto Bight, but Lando was finally written out of the film's script, with the codebreaker role ultimately going to Benicio del Toro's character DJ. Lando finally reappeared in 2019's The Rise of Skywalker, marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history. In the backstory to the film, in the years of peace after the Galactic Civil War, Lando attempted to start a family, and his daughter was born. In the time they were together, he was a loving father, however when she was two years old, she vanished, kidnapped by unknown culprits. In time, it became clear that the First Order was behind both her abduction and those of other children of former Rebel leaders. After the tragedy of losing his daughter and his failure in a quest with Luke Skywalker to find answers about the growing darkness in the Force, Calrissian settled on the desert planet of Pasaana and adopted a life of solitude. Lando first appears in The Rise of Skywalker on Pasaana, guiding Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn, and Chewbacca toward a clue for the whereabouts of the Sith wayfinder. Poe asks Lando to aid the Resistance, but Lando refuses, saying he does not fly anymore, but sends his regards to Leia. Lando reappears much later in the film, upon Leia's death, and he tells a grieving Poe that he, Luke, Leia, and Han were similarly unprepared when they were fighting the Empire, but that they were able to succeed because they had each other. This inspires Poe to launch an offensive against the forces of the Sith Eternal, with Lando traveling the galaxy to recruit Rebel veterans and other supporters of the Resistance's cause to help in the final battle. Just as the Resistance appears most overwhelmed in the battle, Lando, Chewbacca, and Wedge Antilles (Denis Lawson) arrive in the Millennium Falcon alongside a massive fleet of Resistance sympathizers, allies, and veterans, and they help to win the battle and the war. At the end of the film, as the galaxy is celebrating the Resistance's victory, Jannah (Naomi Ackie), a former stormtrooper, approaches Lando and says she does not know where she is from; he tells her that they will find out together. Anthology films Donald Glover portrays a young Lando Calrissian in Solo: A Star Wars Story, which takes place before the original trilogy. Glover had the opportunity to speak with Billy Dee Williams and seek his input. \\"He said, 'Just be charming'. Which is the best advice.\\" Williams had expressed interest in making a cameo appearance (though likely as another character) in the film, but he did not ultimately appear. Lando is introduced as a gambler and \\"retired\\" smuggler who owns a ship fast enough for Han (Alden Ehrenreich) and his associates to use in stealing a load of raw starship fuel. Han tries to win the ship (the Millennium Falcon) from him in a game of sabacc, but Lando cheats and cleans Han out. However, Lando agrees to join the team in exchange for a percentage of the profits from the mission. During the heist and subsequent escape, Lando is injured and his droid co-pilot L3-37 is irreparably damaged, but Han brings the Falcon to safety with help from L3's navigational database after he hotwires it into the ship's computer. Lando later takes the Falcon and abandons the team, but Han tracks him down and wins it from him in another game of sabacc, having stolen the card Lando had up his sleeve to let him cheat. Kathleen Kennedy said, in a statement, that a film focusing on Lando Calrissian could happen, but it would not be a priority at the time. =Television series= Billy Dee Williams returned to the role in the Star Wars Rebels episodes \\"Idiot's Array\\" and \\"The Siege of Lothal\\". In \\"Idiot's Array\\", Lando wins Chopper (voiced by Dave Filoni), the repair droid of the crew of the Ghost, in a game of sabacc, forcing the crew to assist him with a dangerous smuggling run to get their droid back. The crew become Lando's reluctant business partners following the ordeal, leading to their first encounter with the crime boss Azmorigan (voiced by James Hong). In \\"The Siege of Lothal\\", the crew of the Ghost approach Lando for help in getting off of Lothal, which is under Imperial occupation. He is also mentioned on occasion in various other episodes, becoming one of a couple of aliases employed by series protagonist Ezra Bridger (voiced by Taylor Gray). In July 2020, the Kessel Run Transmissions YouTube Channel revealed that they heard word that Lucasfilm was developing a Lando spin off series for Disney+, with Donald Glover reprising his role from Solo. In the same video, they also revealed that there may be plans for a Disney+ series focusing on Lando and Jannah (Naomi Ackie) set after the events of The Rise of Skywalker. Lucasfilm has yet to comment on the existence of either of these shows. =Video games= Billy Dee Williams reprises his role as Lando Calrissian in various games, including as a playable character in Star Wars Battlefront and Battlefront II. However, only the second is canonical to the storyline of the films, due to the first game not containing any kind of narrative. =Comics= Lando Calrissian is the lead character in Lando, a five-issue miniseries published in 2015. Lando has a brief appearance in the comic miniseries Shattered Empire published by Marvel Comics in 2015. Lando is also the lead character in the comic Lando: Double or Nothing, a five-issue miniseries released in 2018. =Books= The novel Star Wars: Last Shot reveals that between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, Lando is considering settling down with a Twi'lek girlfriend. =Legends media= Legends novels, comics, and video games are not considered canonical to the films. With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014. The Star Wars comic book series released by Marvel Comics featured Lando as a prominent character following The Empire Strikes Back. In the comic series, he has a crime lord nemesis named Drebble, and Lando will frequently make use of his foil's name as a cover identity so that any animosity he generates while using the alias will be brought against the real Drebble, not Lando himself.Interview with Jo Duffy This eventually backfires when \\"Drebble's\\" exploits are recognized by the Rebellion and Lando - being the only person who knows of him - has to present the real Drebble with an award for his own activities. Lando is a supporting character in Legends novels that took place after Return of the Jedi commonly depicted Lando as getting involved in a variety of entrepreneurial schemes, including Nomad City in Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy and the Kessel Spice Mines in the works of Kevin J. Anderson. During The Corellian Trilogy, Lando goes on a galaxy-wide hunt for a rich wife, ultimately marrying Tendra Risant. With his in-laws' money and his entrepreneurial abilities, he opens a mining facility on the outer rim planet of Dubrillion. In The New Jedi Order and beyond, Lando continues being a valuable ally and friend to the Skywalker/Solo family. In Fury, the seventh novel of the Legacy of the Force series, Lando announces to Han and Leia that he and Tendra are having a child. Kevin J. Anderson stated that Lucasfilm toyed with the idea of killing off Lando, noting the character had run his course for Expanded Universe authors in the 1990s. The Lando Calrissian Adventures The Lando Calrissian Adventures is a 1983 trilogy of science fiction novels by L. Neil Smith. Set in the Star Wars Expanded Universe, the novels chronicle Lando's smuggling days before the events of the original Star Wars trilogy. The series has been described as \\"space pulp\\", and highlights the differences between Lando and Han Solo. The books were released in July, October, and December 1983, and were the first Star Wars books released since The Han Solo Adventures (1979‚Äì1980); both trilogies were originally published by Del Rey, a division of Ballantine Books. They were also among the last novels in the franchise until Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy was released in the early 1990s. The series was retroactively set ten years before the original Star Wars film, and is brought into chronological context with the rest of the Expanded Universe in Rebel Dawn (1998), the final book of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy. The novelization of Solo: A Star Wars Story makes reference to the events of the first book as a previous adventure of Lando's, which he recounts while composing his autobiographical \\"Calrissian Chronicles\\". He further estimates that it will be the first in a trilogy of his adventures. Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu is the first novel in Smith's Lando Calrissian trilogy, published by Del Rey on 1 July 1983. It is noted as being more of a psychedelic fantasy novel than hard science fiction. The book begins shortly after Lando wins the Millennium Falcon in a game of sabacc, as well as a robot which must be picked up in the Rafa system. Upon the planet of Rafa IV, convicts are made to harvest mind- draining \\"life-crystals\\" which prolong the life of elite citizens. Lando is arrested and brought before the colony's corrupt governor and the sorcerer Rokur Gepta, who will let him keep his life and liberty if he can locate the legendary Mindharp of the ancient and long-lost Sharu civilization. The Mindharp is revealed to be kept inside a multidimensional pyramid with mind- altering properties, which provides a strange adventure for the daring Lando. Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon is the second novel in the trilogy, published on 1 October 1983. After selling a load of life-crystals, and accompanied by his droid Vuffi Raa, Lando attempts a career as an honest freighter captain. After some bad luck, he is soon nostalgic for his old trade. Fortunately, he is invited to a sabacc game on Oseon celebrating an event called Flamewind, but is followed by Rokur Gepta. After an explosion rocks the hull of the Falcon, they safely land. During the sabacc game, Lando is distracted by the apparent sabotage of his ship, and is assaulted. He comes under trial for having a weapon, illegal on the planet. He is offered a smuggling deal as an alternative to execution. Lando Calrissian and the Starcave of ThonBoka is the third novel, published on 1 December 1983. Nearly a year after Lando and Vuffi Raa have left the Oseon system, while traveling in deep space they encounter Lehesu, a vacuum-breathing creature. Able to establish communication, they find out he is also on an adventure away from his home, the ThonBoka nebula. A month later, Lando and Raa receive word that ThonBoka is under attack from the Imperial Centrality Navy. Lehesu's exploration of the Centrality apparently provoked the attack on his species. Lando and Raa rush to assist their friend. The Imperial blockade makes Lando nervous, but he cons his way through the fleet. When the Millennium Falcon strays from its course and is ordered to return, they dump explosives and go into hyperspace to fake the Falcon's destruction. Meanwhile, Rokur Gepta forms an alliance with a confederate squadron. Lando and Raa reunite with Lehesu, and hear of a negotiation attempt which only results in an outbreak of battle. The vacuum-breathing creatures use their projection and hyperspace abilities to fool the Imperial Navy, which fires on its allied ships. As Vuffi Raa pilots the Falcon, Lando engages the enemy in battle from the quad-gun in one of their last adventures before Raa is resummoned to his original programming. Video games Williams reprised his role as Lando in Legends videogame Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. In Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, Calrissian is an unlockable playable character, having the characteristic of being able to kiss Leia's hand if she is nearby. Lando is also a playable character in the multiplayer aspect of the 2017 game Star Wars: Battlefront II. Concept and creation =Development= Actor Yaphet Kotto was an early choice for the role of Lando Calrissian, but chose to appear in the prison drama Brubaker instead. In writing The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas initially considered that Lando Calrissian was a clone from a planet of clones which caused the Clone Wars mentioned in the original Star Wars film. =Portrayal= The Verge noted that despite Han Solo's first name being written as \\"Han\\" and franchise creator George Lucas also pronouncing the name as \\"Han\\" () off-screen, within the films most characters, including Luke Skywalker, pronounce it as \\"Hahn\\" (). The Verge also noted how Billy Dee Williams' Lando seems to be the only character to pronounce it as \\"Han\\" like Lucas, and that when, in The Empire Strikes Back, Lando is choked by Chewbacca for betraying Han, Lando causes most other characters to shift to \\"Han\\". In Solo: A Star Wars Story, Glover decided to deliberately use \\"Han\\" instead of \\"Hahn\\" in order to honor the character's trait. Dialogue in Solo suggests that Lando is sexually interested in men, women, and droids, including both Han and L3-37. When asked about a scene where L3 jokes about Lando's flirtatiousness towards Han, writer Lawrence Kasdan said, \\"That is her personality. Maybe it means something, maybe it doesn't.\\" Co-writer Jonathan Kasdan implies that Lando is pansexual, stating, \\"There's a fluidity to Donald and Billy Dee's [portrayal of Lando's] sexuality ... I would have loved to have gotten a more explicitly LGBT character into this movie. I think it's time, certainly, for that, and I love the fluidity ‚Äï sort of the spectrum of sexuality that Donald appeals to and that droids are a part of. He doesn't make any hard and fast rules.\\" Reception According to Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post, Lando is a \\"fascinating and fraught part of the Star Wars legacy and the conversation around race in science fiction\\". She added that \\"Lando's the only character in Star Wars with a truly comfortable sense of style.\\" On his portrayal, she wrote, \\"One of Williams's accomplishments in Empire and Return of the Jedi is how much he [feels] like an old-fashioned movie star in a futuristic setting without making the performance seem incongruous.\\" Lando Calrissian was chosen as the 11th best Star Wars character by IGN and the 12th best Star Wars hero by IGN's Jesse Schedeen, who also said that he was one of the characters he'd most like to see in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. In 2015, Billy Dee Williams publicly admitted that he received backlash from children who were angered by Lando's betrayal of Han Solo in The Empire Strikes Back. Williams felt that the situation would have been different if Lando had been played by a white actor. Williams wrote that \\"Lando is not black or white, he's just Lando. Above and beyond the arguments or discussions of bygone eras, he is of the future.\\" He further stated, Writing for The Verge, Megan Farokhmanesh criticized Jonathan Kasdan's assertion that Lando is pansexual as \\"a piss-poor shot at representation\\", and argued that Kasdan was conflating pansexuality with promiscuity. Farokhmanesh compared the assertion to J. K. Rowling's statement that Albus Dumbledore is gay, despite none of the Harry Potter books mentioning the character's sexual orientation. In 2019, Billy Dee Williams criticized the decision as well, blaming Solo's underperformance at the box office on its focus on this \\"topical\\" issue. =In popular culture= * A Kenner Lando Calrissian action figure appears among Elliot's toys in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. * In Something, Something Dark Side and It's A Trap!, Family Guys parodies of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Mort Goldman served as a stand-in for Lando Calrissian. * In the TV series Timeless season 2 episode 22 (\\"The King of the Delta Blues,\\" 4/22/18) Connor Mason (Paterson Joseph) uses Lando Calrissian as his alias and stands in as the technician for the legendary recording session with Robert Johnson; when he returns to the present, his record dust jacket has Lando Calrissian listed as the recording technician.

He is a bounty hunter featured in both the original and prequel film trilogies, but first appeared in the non-canonical Star Wars Holiday Special (1978), voiced by Don Francks. In the original trilogy, the character is a supporting antagonist and was mainly portayed by Jeremy Bulloch. Notable for speaking very few words and never removing his helmet, Boba appears in both The Empire Strikes Back (1980), under the employ of the Galactic Empire, and Return of the Jedi (1983), employed by the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. In Return of the Jedi, he apparently meets his demise after falling into a Sarlacc. Boba was later retroactively added in the Special Edition of A New Hope released in 1997, making a non-speaking cameo appearance. In the prequel film Attack of the Clones (2002), which reveals the character's origins as the clone \\"son\\" of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, a younger Boba is portrayed by Daniel Logan. Boba accompanies his father throughout the film, and witnesses his death at the hands of Jedi Master Mace Windu. Regarded as the best bounty hunter in the Star Wars galaxy of his era, Boba has both the skills and arsenal to complete almost any contract he is given. He usually carries a EE-3 carbine rifle, while his armor incorporates a jetpack, flamethrower, whipcord launcher, wrist laser, and vibroblades. Boba also owns a spaceship, the Slave I, which he inherited from Jango and painted green and red to match the colors of his armor. The design of the character's armor inspired that of the Mandalorians, the natives of the planet Mandalore. While Boba himself is not Mandalorian, it was retroactively established that his armor is. As an unmodified clone of Jango Fett, Boba has free will and a normal aging rate, but nonetheless shows sympathy towards fellow clone troopers, who were used as soldiers by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. Aside from the films, Boba appears in various canon and non-canon Star Wars media, such as books, comics, television series, and video games, many of which depict his adventures post-Return of the Jedi, revealing that the character survived his apparent death in the film. Logan reprised his role as Boba in the 2008 animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, which depicts the character's roots as a bounty hunter and his failed attempts to exact revenge on Mace Windu for murdering Jango. Temuera Morrison, who played Jango in Attack of the Clones, has voiced Boba in various Star Wars works, among other actors. The character quickly became a fan favorite despite his limited presence in the original trilogy, and is a widely recognized figure in popular culture; his popularity within the Star Wars fanbase has earned him a cult status. Appearances The character of Boba Fett made his first public appearance at the San Anselmo Country Fair parade on 24 September 1978. In the parade, the Boba Fett costume was worn by Duwayne Dunham, working at the time as an assistant film editor and who later became a film and television director. The character debuted on television two months later in an animated segment produced by Toronto-based animation firm Nelvana Productions for the Star Wars Holiday Special. Fett appears as a mysterious figure who saves Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 from a giant monster, only to be revealed as a bounty hunter working for Darth Vader. After his image and identity were revealed in the Holiday Special, costumed Fett characters appeared in shopping malls and special events, putting up wanted posters of the character to distinguish him from the franchise's Imperial characters. He also appears in Marvel Comics' Star Wars newspaper strip. =Original trilogy era= Fett's theatrical film debut was an unnamed bounty hunter in The Empire Strikes Back as the \\"next major villain\\" besides Darth Vader. He is one of six bounty hunters assembled by Vader, who promises a reward to whoever captures the crew of the Millennium Falcon. Fett tracks the starship to Cloud City, where Vader captures its passengers and tortures its captain, Han Solo. Aiming to collect a bounty on Solo, Fett questions Vader regarding the carbon freeze, which Vader intends to use on his true target, Luke Skywalker. Vader promises that the Empire will compensate Fett if Solo dies, but he survives and Vader turns him over to Fett. Return of the Jedi features Boba Fett at Jabba the Hutt's palace where Han Solo's rescuers are captured. He aims his weapon at Princess Leia (disguised as bounty hunter Boushh) when she threatens Jabba with a thermal detonator, and he later travels on Jabba's sail barge to the Great Pit of Carkoon, home of the Sarlacc, where the prisoners are to be executed. When the prisoners revolt and fight back, Fett flies over and intervenes by tying up Luke, who manages to escape. Chewbacca warns Han Solo, who is still blind after being frozen in carbonite, that Boba Fett is near. Solo turns around and in the process accidentally sets off Fett's rocket pack, sending the bounty hunter falling into the Sarlacc's mouth. In the 1997 Special Edition release of the film, Fett is featured flirting with some of the crime lord's female dancers while in the palace‚Äîthis was an entirely new scene, not included in any prior theatrical, broadcast, or home video version. In this film, he does not have any verbal lines. Fett appears in an episode of the 1985 Droids animated series set before the original trilogy and produced by the same studio as the animated segment of the Holiday Special. In \\"A Race to the Finish\\", Fett is hired by the Fromms to help them get revenge on the masters of the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. He later turns on them after failing their request, and decides to accept Jabba's bounty on the Fromms as compensation. In the 1997 Special Edition of the original Star Wars, Fett briefly appears in a reintroduced cut scene outside the Millennium Falcon while Jabba confronts Han Solo, although he is posthumously superimposed, and not part of the original shooting, as the character did not make part of the original script. =Prequel trilogy era= The 2002 prequel film Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones revealed that Boba Fett is an unaltered clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, who had him created on Kamino to be raised as his son as part of his price to serve as a matrix for the Grand Army of the Republic's clone troopers. Boba helps Jango escape from Obi-Wan Kenobi. Later, on Geonosis he witnesses Jango's death by lightsaber at the hands of Jedi Master Mace Windu. =Anthology films= A Mandalorian armor resembling Fett's can be seen in the background of a few scenes in Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), as part of Dryden Vos's collection of rare artefacts. =Television= The Clone Wars Logan reprised his role as the voice of Fett in the CGI- animated series The Clone Wars. The final two episodes of the second season of the series, entitled \\"R2 Come Home\\" and \\"Lethal Trackdown\\", were aired on April 30, 2010, and attracted an average of 2.756 million viewers during the original broadcast. The finale is significant for ending \\"with twin fandom bangs, courtesy of Boba Fett and a mammoth beast inspired by Godzilla\\". Fett's entrance in the series commemorates the 30 year anniversary of the character's appearance in The Empire Strikes Back. Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu are trapped in the crumbling ruins of a crashed ship while searching for survivors, and only R2-D2 can get out a message to save them‚Äîif he can elude vicious gundarks and a crew of determined bounty hunters led by Boba Fett and Aurra Sing. While Anakin and Mace Windu recover from their injuries, Plo Koon and Ahsoka Tano track down Boba Fett from the underworld of Coruscant to the planet Florrum. Fett's revenge scheme leads to a climactic battle, and the life of a Republic admiral hangs in the balance. Fett is shown working with bounty hunters Aurra Sing, Bossk, and Castas. With their help, Fett attempts to avenge his father's death at the hands of Mace Windu. However, he is unsuccessful, and as a result of his actions, is sentenced to prison along with Bossk. They escape prison in the fourth season, and Fett forms his own syndicate of bounty hunters, including Bossk and Dengar, who first appeared in The Empire Strikes Back along with Fett. The Mandalorian The Mandalorian follows the adventures of Din Djarin, a Mandalorian bounty hunter who carries a weapon visually similar to the one Fett carries in the Holiday Special. The first season episode \\"Chapter 5: The Gunslinger\\" ends with a mysterious armored figure (never fully seen by the viewer) walking by the corpse of Fennec Shand, which has been speculated by fans to be Fett. In May 2020, it was reported that Temuera Morrison would appear as Boba Fett in the second season of The Mandalorian, potentially canonizing the character's survival of the events of the film. Timothy Olyphant will play Cobb Vanth, someone who acquired Fett's Mandalorian armor. =Comics and video games= In the first issue of Darth Vader (2015), the titular antihero hires Boba Fett's band of bounty hunters, who are in the court of Jabba the Hutt, to capture the pilot who destroyed the Death Star. In the 2015 Star Wars comic, Fett discovers the identity of the pilot and tells Vader, who realizes Luke Skywalker is his son. Fett appears in video games Star Wars Battlefront and Star Wars Battlefront II. =Legends= In April 2014, the licensed Star Wars novels, comics and video games released up to that point were rebranded by Disney as Legends and declared non-canon to the film franchise in order to create a blank slate for the sequel trilogy. Fett appears extensively in Legends novels, comic books, and video games. Before the release of the prequel trilogy, Daniel Keys Moran developed a backstory for Fett in which he was once named Jaster Mereel, a \\"Journeyman Protector\\" who was convicted of treason. His backstory was depicted differently in Attack of the Clones, leading to the Dark Horse comic Jango Fett: Open Seasons (2003) retconning Mereel to Jango's mentor. A young-adult book series called Boba Fett (2002‚Äì2004) depicts Fett during the Clone Wars, when he takes his father's ship and armor to begin his bounty-hunting career with Jabba the Hutt. Fett appears in the years leading up to A New Hope in the comic Boba Fett: Enemy of the Empire (1999), in which Vader hires Fett before trying to kill him, as well as Blood Ties (2010‚Äì2012) and Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika (2000‚Äì2001). He also appears in many works set during the original trilogy, including Dark Horse's short comic Boba Fett: Salvage (1997), issues of Empire (2002‚Äì2005) and Star Wars (2013‚Äì14), the one-shot comic Boba Fett: Overkill (2006), The Bounty Hunter Wars book trilogy, volumes of the young-reader series Galaxy of Fear (1997‚Äì1998), and the choose-your-own-adventure book The Bounty Hunter (1994). He is also notably featured in the 1996 Shadows of the Empire multimedia project. Works such as Dark Horse's Dark Empire series (1991‚Äì1992) describe Fett surviving the Sarlacc. In a 1995 anthology story, Fett nearly kills the Sarlacc with explosives, and a 1996 story narrates how Dengar finds him and restores him back to health. In the comic Boba Fett: Twin Engines of Destruction (1997), while Fett recovers, he is impersonated by a bounty hunter named Jodo Kast. After realizing that it is an imposter, Dengar warns Fett, who kills Kast. Four Boba Fett comics set several years after Return of the Jedi were released between 1995 and 2000. Fett encounters Han Solo in a short story set 15 years after the events of the same film, and fights side-by-side with him in The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force (2003), set a decade later. In the Legacy of the Force series (2006‚Äì2008), set some 35 years after Return of the Jedi, Han and Leia's daughter, Jaina, asks Fett to train her to help her defeat her corrupted brother, Jacen. The series reveals that Fett became a family man at one point, though he was forcibly separated from his wife after killing his commanding officer for assaulting her. His wife subsequently disappeared and was presumed dead. Their granddaughter later sought Boba out and married a Mandalorian warrior. Boba's wife was discovered to still be alive, having been frozen in carbonite decades earlier. The Bounty Hunter Wars The Bounty Hunter Wars is a trilogy of science-fiction novels by K.W. Jeter set during the events of the original trilogy. The books were published by Bantam Spectra in July 1998, November 1998, and July 1999. The trilogy depicts Fett as being more communicative than in the films because its plot requires Fett to show \\"an ability to convince people as well as kill them\\". The first book, ''''', starts during the events of Return of the Jedi, shortly after Jabba the Hutt's sail barge is destroyed. Dengar stays with Fett after the latter's near-death experience, and encounters Neelah, a dancer in Jabba's palace who has lost her memory, and thinks Fett can help her. Kuat of Kuat, an Imperial executive, reviews footage from the Great Pit of Carkoon, leading him to suspect that Fett is still alive. It is related in flashbacks set between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back that Fett stole a bounty Bossk and Zuckuss were hunting on behalf of the Bounty Hunters Guild. After delivering the bounty, Fett accepted a contract to join the Bounty Hunters Guild in order to break it up. The Emperor met with Darth Vader and Prince Xizor, where the latter revealed that it was he who planned for Fett to join the guild in order to eliminate its weakest members, leaving only the best for the Empire to exploit. In the second book, ''''', Fett abandons the Slave I to avoid dispelling rumors of his death, and instead steals Bossk's ship. Riding along, Dengar tells Neelah about the split of the Bounty Hunters Guild. After Bossk killed his father, the guild split into two factions: one composed of the older members, and another composed of Bossk and other younger members. Prince Xizor placed an enormous bounty on a renegade stormtrooper who slaughtered his entire ship's crew. Fett, Bossk and Zuckuss captured the trooper, but Fett jettisoned his partners in an escape pod. In the third and final book, ''''', it is related that Fett tried to claim his bounty, but found Xizor waiting to kill him in order to tie up loose ends related to his plot. In an attack on the megalomaniacal prince, Kuat of Kuat had falsified some evidence implicating him in the murder of Luke Skywalker's aunt and uncle. This information was on the renegade stormtrooper's ship (which is why Kuat wanted to make sure the bounty hunter was dead) but is retrieved by Fett in the present, as Neelah realizes she is from an elite Kuat family and stops her sinister sister from taking over the now-suicidal Imperial executive's shipyard. Boba Fett: A Practical Man Boba Fett: A Practical Man is an e-novella by Karen Traviss, which was published online in August 2006 by Del Rey Books. Set twenty years after the events of Return of the Jedi, it focuses on what led Boba Fett and the Mandalorians to fend off the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaders in The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force (set a few months later). A Yuuzhan Vong named Nom Anor meets Fett on Mandalore and begins giving him and the Mandalorians directions to help their invasion. Fett plans to do as much damage to the invaders as possible, even as he pretends to help them. He instructs a pilot to deliver his plea for help to the New Republic, but with the Vong's next target still unwarned, the world falls without a fight. A Vong warrior asks Fett to assist in killing a Jedi; instead, Fett convinces the Jedi to deliver his message. The Jedi returns and confirms that Fett has a deal: the Mandalorians will continue to masquerade as Vong mercenaries while passing intel to the Republic. Fett agrees to have a few of his best commandos train planetary militias to fight the Vong.https://web.archive.org/web/20061229225047/http://starwars.com/eu/lit/novel/news20060609.html announcementhttps://web.archive.org/web/20060821214727/http://www.ereader.com/product/book/excerpt/22631?book=Star_Wars%3A_Boba_Fett%3A_A_Practical_Man First eighteen paragraphs =Unproduced works= A planned live-action TV series developed by Star Wars creator George Lucas before the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney, titled Star Wars: Underworld, would have featured Fett. Star Wars 1313 The cancelled LucasArts video game Star Wars 1313, originally announced at E3 2012, would have told the story of Boba Fett's career as a young adult bounty hunter between the prequel and original trilogies. In it, Fett would have navigated past the scum of civilization in an underground area of Coruscant known as Level 1313. In 2013, as a result of Disney's acquisition of the franchise, all LucasArts projects then in production were shelved. In a December 2015 interview with /Film, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy stated that the concept art for the game was \\"unbelievable\\" and that, along with Star Wars: Underworld, it was \\"something we're spending a lot of time looking at, poring through, discussing, and we may very well develop those things further\\". Level 1313 makes appearances in Star Wars media such as Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle. In The Clone Wars, Ahsoka visits a platform numbered 1313 in the Coruscant underworld. The Clone Wars episodes Fett was to have appeared in more episodes of The Clone Wars before its cancellation. A series of Western- inspired episodes would have featured Fett teaming up with Cad Bane to rescue a child kidnapped by Tusken Raiders on Tatooine; Aurra Sing would have appeared as well. The episodes would have depicted Fett donning his armor for the first time. Footage shown at Star Wars Celebration depicted Bane blasting Fett in the head, creating the iconic dent in his helmet; this idea came from George Lucas. Standalone movie In early 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced the development of a Star Wars spin-off film written by Simon Kinberg, which Entertainment Weekly reported would focus on Boba Fett during the original trilogy. In mid-2014, Josh Trank was officially announced as the director of an undisclosed spin-off film, but had left the project a year later due to creative differences with Kinberg, causing a teaser for the Fett film to be scrapped from Star Wars Celebration. In May 2018, it was reported that James Mangold had signed on to write and direct a Fett film, with Kinberg attached as producer and . The author of a Fett-focused Legends story stated that Lucasfilm had considered adapting it into a film. However, by October, the Fett film was reportedly \\"100% dead\\", with the studio instead focusing on The Mandalorian series, which utilizes a similar character design. The Fett film was afterwards reported to have also featured the other bounty hunters from The Empire Strikes Back. Concept and development George Lucas created Boba Fett in his April 1978 draft of The Empire Strikes Back, basing the character on Sergio Leone's Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood). The character needed to be designed quickly, as Lucas had agreed for him to be featured in the Star Wars Holiday Special later that year. The character's design stemmed from initial concepts for Darth Vader, who was originally conceived as a rogue bounty hunter. While Vader became less a mercenary and more of a dark knight, the bounty hunter concept remained, and Fett became \\"an equally villainous\\" but \\"less conspicuous\\" character. Concept artist Ralph McQuarrie influenced Fett's design, which was finalized by and is credited to Joe Johnston. Norman Reynolds and the film's art department built the costume. Fett's armor was originally designed for \\"super troopers\\", and was adapted for Fett as the script developed. Screen-tested in all-white, Fett's armor eventually garnered a subdued color scheme intended to visually place him between white-armored \\"rank-and-file\\" Imperial stormtroopers and Vader, who wears black. This color scheme had the added bonus of conveying the \\"gray morality\\" of his character. The character's armor was designed to appear to have been scavenged from multiple sources, and it is adorned with trophies. A description of Fett's armor in the mid-1979 Bantha Tracks newsletter catalyzed \\"rampant speculation\\" about his origins. By 1979, Fett's backstory included having served in an army of Imperial shock troops which had battled the clone troopers of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Despite two years of widespread publicity about Fett's appearance in The Empire Strikes Back, script rewrites significantly reduced the character's presence in the film. Fett's musical theme, composed by John Williams, is \\"not music, exactly\\" but \\"more of a gurgly, viola-and-bassoon thing aurally cross-pollinated with some obscure static sounds.\\" Sound editor Ben Burtt added the sound of jangling spurs, created and performed by the foley artist team of Robert Rutledge and Edward Steidele, to Fett's appearance in Cloud City, intending to make the character menacing and the scene reminiscent of similar gunfighter appearances in Western films. Boba Fett's spaceship is called the Slave I.The Empire Strikes Back DVD audio commentary At one point in Return of the Jedis development, Fett was conceived as being a main villain, but he was finally replaced with Emperor Palpatine when Lucas decided to not make a third trilogy of Star Wars. Lucas also considered Fett fighting Lando during the Sarlacc sequence. An official reference book states that Fett charges \\"famously expensive\\" fees and that he undertakes only when the mission meets \\"his harsh sense of justice\\". Daniel Keys Moran, who wrote a few stories featuring Boba Fett, cited Westerns as an influence on his development of the character. Moran said: Lucas at one point considered depicting Vader and Fett as brothers in the prequel films, but discounted it as too \\"hokey\\". In continuing to develop the character in the prequel films, Lucas closed some avenues for expanding the character's story while opening others. Lucas considered adding a shot of Fett escaping the Sarlacc in later editions of Return of the Jedi, but decided against it because it would have detracted from the story's focus.Return of the Jedi DVD audio commentary Lucas also said that, had he known Fett would be so popular, he would have made the character's death \\"more exciting\\". In 2014, Star Wars historian Jonathan W. Winzler revealed that Lucas had told him that Fett escaped from the Sarlacc, but this has yet to be demonstrated in the film canon. =Film casting and production= Boba Fett is primarily played by Jeremy Bulloch in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Bulloch's half-brother alerted him to the role. He was cast as Fett because the costume happened to fit \\"as if a Savile Row tailor had come out and made it\\"; he did not have to do a reading or screen test, and Bulloch never worked from a script for either film. Filming the role for Empire lasted three weeks. The actor was pleased with the costume and used it to convey the character's menace. Bulloch based his performance on Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the Man with No Name in A Fistful of Dollars; similar to the Western character, Bulloch cradled the gun prop, made the character seem ready to shoot, slightly tilted his head, and stood a particular way. Bulloch did not try to construct a backstory for the character, and said later that \\"the less you do with Boba Fett, the stronger he becomes\\". Playing Fett in Empire was both the smallest and most physically uncomfortable role Bulloch has played; Bulloch said donning the heavy jetpack was the worst aspect of the role. Bulloch spent four weeks on Return of the Jedi. He was unaware of Fett's demise before filming began and was \\"very upset\\" by the development; he would like to have done more with Fett. Still, Bulloch believed killing Fett made the character stronger, and that his \\"weak\\" death makes fans want the character to return. Bulloch thought a scene created for the Special Edition in which Fett flirts with one of Jabba's dancers was not in keeping with the character's nature. A younger version of the character was played by Daniel Logan in Attack of the Clones. Logan had not seen any of the Star Wars films prior to being cast as Fett, but he watched the original trilogy at Lucas' request. The actor had to rely on his imagination for the bluescreen filming. Both Bulloch and Logan had also expressed interest in reprising their role of Fett in the planned Underworld TV series, but the series remains undeveloped. Other portrayals According to the official Star Wars website, Fett was voiced by Don Francks in the Holiday Special. Bulloch wore Fett's costume in Empire and Jedi, but John Morton filled in during one scene for Empire, and Jason Wingreen voiced the character in Empire. His brief appearance in A New Hope was performed by Industrial Light & Magic creature animator Mark Austin. The character's appearance in the Special Edition footage of Jedi was performed by Don Bies and Nelson Hall. For the 2004 rereleases, Temuera Morrison replaced the character's original voice for continuity purposes. The character's voice in National Public Radio's Star Wars radio dramas was provided by Alan Rosenberg in The Empire Strikes Back and Ed Begley, Jr. in Return of the Jedi, Tim Glovatsky in the audio adaptation of Dark Forces: Rebel Agent, Joe Hacker in an audio adaptation of the Dark Empire comics, Temuera Morrison for Empire at War, Battlefront II and Battlefront: Elite Squadron, Dee Bradley Baker in The Force Unleashed, The Force Unleashed II and Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, Chris Cox in Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike, Tom Kane in Galactic Battlegrounds, Demolition and Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, and Daniel Logan for The Clone Wars animated TV series and Lego Star Wars: The Video Game. Fett made a cameo appearance in a live-action mockumentary filmed on the set of Return of the Jedi titled Return of the Ewok (1982). Post-production was never completed, and it has never been officially released.David Tomblin: A.D. to Indy Jones, Starlog #86 pp. 44‚Äì46, 58. September 1984. Reception Boba Fett is a \\"cult figure\\" and one of the most popular Star Wars characters. In 2008, Boba Fett was selected by Empire magazine as the 79th greatest movie character of all time, and he is included on Fandomanias list of The 100 Greatest Fictional Characters. IGN ranked Boba Fett as the eighth top Star Wars character, due to his status as a fan- favourite and cult following. He personifies \\"danger and mystery\\", and Susan Mayse calls Fett \\"the unknowable Star Wars character\\" who \\"delivers mythic presence.\\" Although Tom Bissell asserts that no one knows why Boba Fett has become so popular, nor cares why, both Lucas and Bulloch cite Fett's mysterious nature as reasons for his popularity. Bulloch, who has never fully understood the character's popularity, attributes it to the costume and the respect Fett garners from Darth Vader and Jabba the Hutt. The initial Boba Fett toy, more than Fett's actual film appearance, might be responsible for the character's popularity; Henry Jenkins suggests children's play helped the character \\"take on a life of its own\\". Moran said Vader's admonition specifically to Fett in The Empire Strikes Back‚Äî\\"No disintegrations\\"‚Äîgives Fett credibility; he was interested in Fett because the character is \\"strong, silent, [and] brutal\\". Jeter says that even when Fett appears passive, he conveys \\"capability and ruthlessness\\". Bissell credits Bulloch for giving Fett \\"effortless authority\\" in his first scene in The Empire Strikes Back, using such nuances as cradling his blaster and slightly cocking his head. Fett's small role in the film may actually have made the character seem more intriguing. Logan, who was a Young Artist Award nominee for his portrayal of Fett, compares Fett to \\"that boy in school who never talks\\" and who attracts others' curiosity. Bissell adds that Boba Fett, along with other minor characters like Darth Maul and Kyle Katarn, appeals to adolescent boys' \\"images of themselves: essentially bad-ass but ... honorable about it.\\" This tension and the absence of a clear \\"evil nature\\" (distinct from evil actions) offer Fett dramatic appeal. Furthermore, Fett \\"is cool because he was designed to be cool\\", presenting a \\"wicked ambiguity\\" akin to John Milton's portrayal of Satan in Paradise Lost and Iago in William Shakespeare's Othello. Bissell compares Fett to Beowulf, Ahab, and Huckleberry Finn: characters \\"too big\\" for their original presentation, and apt for continued development in other stories. Moran finds Fett reminiscent of the Man with No Name. Fett has been featured extensively in pop culture and parodies. Breckin Meyer provides his voice in various Robot Chicken sketches. Nerdcore rapper MC Chris included a Star Wars-themed song titled \\"Fett's Vette\\" on his 2001 debut album. The creator of the Spartan helmets for the 2006 film 300 painted one of them to look like Fett's helmet. The San Francisco Chronicle describes Boba Fett fans as \\"among the most passionate\\", and the character is important to Star Wars fan culture. Boba Fett's popular following before the character even appeared in The Empire Strikes Back influenced Damon Lindelof's interest in developing Lost across multiple media. Between filming The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Mark Hamill pitched the idea that Fett was Luke Skywalker's mother to George Lucas, which \\"he didn't like\\". In about 2000, a feminist campaigned online to have the character unmasked as a woman. Fan parodies include Boba Phat, a cosplay \\"intergalactic booty hunter\\" created by David James. =In The Clone Wars= IGN reviewer Eric Goldman rated the first episode 8.2/10 and the second 8.8/10, stating \\"this was a very layered, exciting episode to end Season 2 on\\", though he did not appreciate Boba Fett's limited dialogue. Bryan Young, a writer for The Huffington Post and Examiner.com, also disliked Fett's responses at the end of the episode when confronting Mace Windu: \\"He says something incredibly whiny.\\" Young does state, however, that \\"[o]verall, this pair of episodes was a satisfying conclusion to season two, which really upped the game in this series in terms of animation, storytelling and suspense.\\" GalacticBinder.com's reviewer Chris Smith wrote, \\"Lucasfilm delivers another exciting episode to finish off a tremendous second season.\\" Adam Rosenberg writing in MTV Movies Blog discusses Boba Fett's return: \\"He's going to have to be put through a lot more hell before he embraces his inner badass. I'll say though... he's off to a mighty good start with the dual blasters he wears on his belt. Sure, they're almost the size of his thighs, but hey... he's still just a kid.\\" =Merchandising= Fett is one of the top five best-selling Star Wars action figures, and Boba Fett-related products are \\"among the most expensive\\" Star Wars merchandise. Fett was the first new mail-away action figure created for The Empire Strikes Back; although advertised as having a rocket-firing backpack, safety concerns led Kenner to sell his rocket attached. Gray called the early toy \\"a rare and precious commodity\\", and one of the rocket-firing prototypes sold at auction for $16,000 in 2003. In 2018 and 2019, two of the prototypes were sold at auction, for ¬£69,000 ($USD92,000) and ¬£90,000 ($USD120,000), respectively‚Äîeach setting the world record for the highest auction price of a Star Wars toy at that time. A fully painted figure with a rare variant on the firing mechanism is planned to be auctioned and estimated to be worth $200,000. In August 2009, Hasbro released a Fett action figure based on McQuarrie's white-armored concept, and Boba Fett as both a child and bounty hunter have been made into Lego minifigures. Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Trading Card Game includes several Boba Fett cards. Hallmark Cards created a Boba Fett Christmas tree ornament. In January 2015, an unopened Boba Fett figure sold for ¬£18,000 at auction in the UK, the figure was in factory fresh condition and did not have the packaging punched for hanging in a shop.

Star Destroyers were produced by Kuat Drive Yards and serve as \\"the signature vessel of the fleet\\" for the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, the First Order, and the Sith Eternal in numerous published works including film, television, novels, comics, and video games.Battlefront: Twilight Company A single Star Destroyer could project considerable influence over a solar system in the name of the Empire: each can be deployed individually as both a forward operating base and as mobile weapon systems platform responsible for safeguarding multiple planets, trade routes and systems, and carried enough firepower to subdue an entire planetary system or annihilate a small rebel fleet. Notable examples of Star Destroyers include the precursor Venator-class Star Destroyer, the ubiquitous Imperial-class Star Destroyer, and the most recent Xyston-class Star Destroyer. Numerous other classes of \\"Star Destroyers\\" share the basic triangular \\"dagger\\" hull; the successful v-shaped designs are explained in Legends as reflecting the Empire's \\"Tarkin's Doctrine\\" military philosophy and originating from Sith ideological influence, and have been adapted by numerous factions for a wide variety of applications. Numerous Star Destroyer models and toys have been released. The iconic scene in Star Wars (1977) featuring the Imperial Star Destroyer's first appearance where it pursues a Corellian Corvette has been called a milestone in special effects history. Concept and design The Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator chases the CR90 corvette Tantive IV over Tatooine. In draft scripts for the film that would become Star Wars, the term \\"Stardestroyer\\" refers to two-man fighters flown by what would become the Galactic Empire. The film's second draft features four Star Destroyers chasing a single Rebel ship,Taylor, p. 115 but the tremendous costs incurred by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) when production began helped lead Lucas to use a single \\"terrifyingly large\\" Star Destroyer instead of four.Taylor, pp. 121-22 ILM built a shooting model that was about half the size of the model for the Tantive IV the Star Destroyer was chasing. Lucas asked ILM to build a larger Star Destroyer model to match the Tantive IV's scale, but ILM convinced him that the Dykstraflex camera invented for the film made this unnecessary.Taylor, p. 171-73 Nevertheless, they added additional hull details to the Star Destroyer model. The 13-second opening shot was the first special effects piece ILM completed, and its success was an essential test for the Dykstraflex. ILM built a Star Destroyer, equipped with internal lighting to provide a better sense of scale, for The Empire Strikes Back (1980). During production, Lucas decided that every Star Wars film would open in space with a shot of a Star Destroyer.Taylor, pp. 247-48 The Empire Strikes Back also introduces the Executor class of \\"Super Star Destroyer\\", also referred to as a \\"Star Dreadnought\\" or \\"Star Dreadnaught\\". The shooting model for the Super Star Destroyer Executor in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) was long. The design of the Venator-class Star Destroyers appearing in Revenge of the Sith (2005) are meant to bridge the appearance of the Acclamator-class transports in Attack of the Clones (2002) and the Imperial class in the original trilogy. The Imperial I-class Star Destroyers are white, as shown in A New Hope, Rogue One, and Solo. The Imperial II-class Star Destroyers in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi are grey.https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/7/11383684/rogue-one-star-wars-trailer- theory Popular Mechanics has pointed out that, despite being freed from the 2D battle constraints of a planetary battle, Star Wars does not go by a true 3D environment in space battles.https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/movies/news/a28088/star-wars- the-last-jedi-dreadnought-star-destroyer/  Depiction  = Films and television = Star Destroyers of varying factions have appeared in every Star Wars film and television production except Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. The iconic Imperial-class Star Destroyer first appears in the opening scene of Star Wars, where the Imperial I (Imperator)-class Star Destroyer Devastator, with Darth Vader on board, chases the CR90 Corvette Tantive IV (carrying Princess Leia) above Tatooine. (The final scene of the prequel film Rogue One leads directly into this; at the end of Rogue One, we see Tantive IV launched and the Devastator preparing to pursue it.) This appearance shows the Imperial Star Destroyer's vast size in comparison to the Rebel Corvette. Star Destroyers of the Imperial II subclass are seen in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi including the opening sequences of both films; the Imperial II has numerous changes (cosmetic and functional) compared to the Imperial I. According to both canon and Star Wars Legends (see below), Imperial I-class Star Destroyers including Devastator still remain in service as of the events of The Empire Strikes Back but have been refitted so they appear cosmetically identical to the Imperial II. The Empire Strikes Back introduces a still larger Super Star Destroyer, the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor, flagship of \\"Death Squadron\\" under the command of Admiral Firmus Piett, Darth Vader's personal Imperial armada. The Executor dwarfs the Devastator and five smaller Imperial-class Star Destroyers escorting it. In Return of the Jedi, Death Squadron swelled to 33 Imperial-class Star Destroyers, 2 battle cruisers, and 3 Tector-class Star Destroyers; the Emperor assumes control of Death Squadron, which executes the ambush against the Rebel fleet, with the Executor as his Imperial flagship. Other Star Destroyer varieties appear in the Star Wars prequel films. The final moments of Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones depicts clone troopers being loaded into large Acclamator-class Republic transgalactic assault ships that are highly similar in appearance to Star Destroyers, perhaps signifying that the Acclamator as a precursor. Venator-class Star Destroyers are introduced in Revenge of the Sith and later appear throughout Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008‚Äì2014, 2020). Venator-class ships initially appear with a red and gray Republic color scheme. However, toward the end of Revenge of the Sith the Venators are dull gray, signifying the Empire's rise to power. (Star Wars creator George Lucas calls the cigar-shaped Separatist cruisers visible at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith \\"Star Destroyers\\" in the movie's DVD commentary track, although this is likely a misnomer. Separatist cruisers and frigates, with their organic shapes and bulges that contrast sharply with the angular lines of Star Destroyers, are the forerunners of the Mon Calamari Star Cruisers and Nebulon-B Escort Frigates used by the Rebel Alliance in the films Rogue One, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.) In the first installment of the sequel trilogy, The Force Awakens (2015), set over 30 years after the fall of the Empire, the wrecks of the Empire's Star Destroyers appear on the surface of the desert planet Jakku. Rey scavenges material from the crashed Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Inflictor, and pilots the Millennium Falcon through the wreckage of the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Ravager. The Force Awakens and its sequel, The Last Jedi (2017), also introduce new Star Destroyers making up the forces of the First Order, such as Kylo Ren's Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer, the Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix, and Supreme Leader Snoke's flagship, the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy. The final entry in the sequel trilogy, The Rise of Skywalker, introduces a fleet of Xyston-class Star Destroyers (which appear similar to the Imperial-class and not the First Order's designs) which are under the command of Emperor Sheev Palpatine and are capable of destroying entire planets like the Death Star and Starkiller Base. = Novels and other media = Star Destroyers appear in novels, games, and other media set during various periods in the Star Wars universe. Novels state the Empire had a dozen Super Star Destroyers in service during the time of the Battle of Endor in addition to Darth Vader's Executor. The final surviving Super Star Destroyer, the Executor-class ship Ravager, is the vessel whose wreckage appears in The Force Awakens. The Ravager's crash onto Jakku is depicted in the game Star Wars Battlefront (2015). The Victory-class Star Destroyer first described in the early Star Wars novella, was initially designed as a direct predecessor to the Imperial-class during the development of A New Hope, which would make it a follow-up to the Venator-class seen in Revenge of the Sith. The Victory appears very similar in appearance to the Imperial-class which succeeded it; albeit the Victory being considerably smaller in scale (900 meters in length versus 1600 meters), adds atmospheric maneuvering \\"wings\\" on the port and starboard sides (according to Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game sourcebooks, the Victory I-class can enter a planetary atmosphere which is a unique attribute not found in the Victory II and Imperial-class Star Destroyers), and a shorter conning tower with different elements on the command bridge. The Victory-class was developed from a prototype Star Destroyer model created by Colin Cantwell for A New Hope, with the final design being used for the basis of the Imperial-class.https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Chronicles Ending up the Victory-class Star Destroyer did not make it to the films and for a long time featured only in Star Wars Legends (see below). It first appeared in the new Star Wars canon in the 2014 novel Tarkin, written by James Luceno, and was first depicted in Darth Vader 6: Vader, Part VI, a 2015 comic book written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Salvador Larroca. The Victory Star Destroyer is the Imperial Navy's starting vessel in the core set of Fantasy Flight Games's Star Wars: Armada, a table top miniatures game released on March 27, 2015.https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/review-armada-wave- two/https://holowriting.com/2015/06/07/star-wars-armada-victory-class-star- destroyer-tactics/ = Star Wars Legends = In April 2014, most of the licensed Star Wars novels, games, and comics produced since 1976 (and prior to 2014), were rebranded by Lucasfilm as Star Wars Legends; and therefore declared non-canon to the franchise. Star Destroyers feature in numerous Legends publications, with a considerable amount of additional notable information. According to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game sourcebooks and other texts, Imperial-class Star Destroyers are constructed by Kuat Drive Yards and hold a distinguished place in the Imperial Navy, symbolizing the Empire's military might with a peak number of more than 25,000 vessels. Like the Venator and Victory-class ships that precede it, the Imperial-class is a multi-role capital ship combining the roles of a battleship, starfighter carrier, and troopship. Notable for its massive size and overwhelming firepower compared to its fore-bearers; a single Imperial- class ship is capable of singlehandedly taking on a fleet of enemy vessels or \\"reducing the surface of a planet to a slag\\" (known as \\"Base Delta Zero\\"), and its mere presence is often enough to deter rebellion. At long, Imperial-class Star Destroyers are crewed by 9,235 Officers, 27,850 enlisted personnel, and 275 Gunners. The Imperial I is armed with 60 turbolasers, 60 ion cannons, and 10 tractor beam projectors for space combat. The standard complement is 72 TIE fighters (including 12 TIE Bombers and 12-24 TIE Interceptors), and a variety of support craft including shuttles and transports. Unlike other comparable capital ships like the Mon Calamari MC80 Star Cruiser of the Rebel Alliance (later New Republic), an Imperial-class Star Destroyer carries a full array of ground forces (including 9700 stormtroopers, 20 AT-ATs and 30 AT-STs) with dropships for rapid deployment to planetary surfaces, plus a prefabricated base if a permanent planetary garrison is required. Though the Imperial Navy also has smaller capital ships like Nebulon-B Escort Frigates and CR90 Corvettes (the films show these vessels being used exclusively by the Rebel Alliance), Imperial-class Star Destroyers are usually the default choice for frontline deployments. At the Battle of Endor the Rebel Alliance captured two Imperial-class Star Destroyers and added them to the New Republic fleet; they serve alongside Mon Calamari Cruisers in General Han Solo's task force as told in the X-wing series of novels and Dark Empire comics. Although the New Republic eventually upgrades its starfleet with newer ship types, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer remains in service well into the New Jedi Order era and fights during the Yuuzhan Vong War. Described in A Guide to the Star Wars Universe (1984) as being long, Executor-class Super Star Destroyers were later described as being long. In addition to Vader's command ship Executor, Star Wars novels introduce the prison ship Lusankya and stealth-armored Knight Hammer as other in the class. Kevin J. Anderson's novel Darksaber describes a Super Star Destroyer as being \\"worth twenty Imperial Star Destroyers\\". The description \\"Star Destroyer\\" and \\"Super Star Destroyer\\" are applied to several other massive dagger/triangle-shaped warships in Star Wars, such as the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer in the Legacy comic series (2006‚Äì2010), and the reborn Emperor Palpatine's flagships Eclipse and Eclipse II Super Star Destroyers in the Dark Empire series (1991‚Äì1995). The Eclipse-class was perhaps the ultimate Super Star Destroyer or Star Dreadnought in the Expanded Universe, incorporating a Death Star-type superlaser but miniaturized and more advanced, and gravity well projectors to prevent enemies from jumping to hyperspace, and having strong enough shields/armor to be able to ram enemy vessels. Curtis Saxton, in the unofficial Star Wars Technical Commentaries (he has since been the author of the official Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Incredible Cross-Sections and Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross- Sections), has advocated using the term Imperator-class in lieu of Imperial- class. Saxton argues that \\"Imperial Star Destroyer\\" is a somewhat generic term, as the vast majority of Star Destroyer types are operated by the Galactic Empire's Imperial Navy which technically means they are all \\"Imperial Star Destroyers\\", although the Imperator/Imperial-class Star Destroyers are by far the most common type. Similarly the \\"Super Star Destroyer\\" moniker has been used for numerous unrelated vessels of varying sizes and classes, so fans have suggested labeling the class instead by the lead ship such as Executor- class and Eclipse-class, with some referred to them instead as a \\"Star Dreadnought\\" (sometimes spelled \\"Star Dreadnaught\\") to emphasize their massive size relative to Star Destroyers.https://www.theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/saxton.asp Author Jason Fry introduced the \\"Anaxes War College System\\" which specifically divide warships into different types depending on their size and power, which explain all the differently sized \\"Super Star Destroyers\\" appearing in the Expanded Universe (now Star Wars Legends), supplementing the contradictory classification systems used in Star Wars lore previously, becoming reference material in the Star Wars Sourcebooks by West End Games. Merchandise Lego has released numerous Star Destroyer kits, including a 4,784-piece Imperial- class Star Destroyer and a 3,152-piece model of the Executor. The Super Star Destroyer has also been merchandised. Kenner wanted to use a less ominous name than Executor for the toy playset of Darth Vader's meditation chamber. An advertisement agency's list of 153 alternatives included Starbase Malevolent, Black Coven, Haphaestus VII, and Cosmocurse; ultimately, the toy was labeled \\"Darth Vader's Star Destroyer\\". In 2006, Wizards of the Coast created an Executor miniature as part of its Star Wars Miniatures Starship Battles game. An electronic Super Star Destroyer toy released by Hasbro \\"is the rarest among Hasbro's Collector Fleet\\".

Propelled by Twin Ion Engines, TIE fighters are fast, agile, yet fragile starfighters produced by Sienar Fleet Systems for the Galactic Empire. TIE fighters and other TIE craft appear in Star Wars films, television shows, and throughout the Star Wars expanded universe. Several TIE fighter replicas and toys, as well as a TIE flight simulator, have been produced and sold by merchandise companies.  Origin and design  Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) Colin Cantwell created the concept model that established the TIE fighter's ball-cockpit and hexagonal panels design for Star Wars (1977). Star Wars creator George Lucas liked the basic design consisting of two panels connected by a stick with a ball-shaped cockpit, but Cantwell's concept had few details. Joe Johnston created additional details, such as the cockpit window and the attachment points between the solar panels and the hull. Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter models for the first film were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted back to being a muted blue. Sound designer Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. In the book The Sounds of Star Wars, the engine roar is likened to German Junker Ju 87 \\"Stuka\\" bombers, who used sirens to frighten civilians on raids. This could have been a possible inspiration for the sound. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in Star Wars were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE Advanced x1 in Star Wars was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE Interceptors developed for Jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, sleek and frightening. The Jedi starfighter, created for Revenge of the Sith (2005), was designed to bridge the appearance of the Jedi starfighter in Attack of the Clones (2002) and the TIE fighter design from the original trilogy. The V-wing starfighter, seen at the end of Revenge of the Sith, also makes the distinctive TIE fighter sound when flying by a Star Destroyer. Dark Horse Comics' Sean Cooke designed the TIE predator for Star Wars: Legacy (2006), set 130 years after the events of Star Wars, to appear both reminiscent of and more advanced than the original TIE fighter.Interview in Star Wars Insider #89 Designers for The Force Awakens (2015) had numerous discussions about how much to \\"update\\" the TIE fighter for the first sequel film set 30 years after Return of the Jedi. They retained the starfighter's design but altered its aesthetic to suggest improvements to the vessel's manufacturing process and materials.  Depiction  Star Wars literature states that Grand Moff Tarkin commissioned Sienar Fleet Systems to design and manufacture the Twin Ion Engine line edition (TIE/ln) space superiority starfighter and most TIE variants. Tarkin specified that the TIE had to be fast, maneuverable, energy efficient, and inexpensive; simply put they are meant to be easily mass produced and engage in swarm tactics, with the expectation of being expendable assets that would be lost in combat. To meet these requirements, Sienar incorporated aspects of the V-wing and Jedi interceptor into the new starfighter. TIE fighters have two hexagonal wings fitted with solar panels which power a twin ion engine (TIE) system that accelerates ionized gases at a substantial fraction of lightspeed along almost any vector, affording the ships tremendous speed and maneuverability albeit with limited fuel reserves.Windham (2019), p. 15-27 These wings are also structurally sound enough to double as landing gear and feature repulsorlifts for take-off and landing, though TIE fighters are designed to be launched and recovered by cycling storage racks utilized by Imperial starships and garrisons.Windham (2019), p. 116 The TIE fighter's primary weapons are a pair of laser cannons tied to a secondary generator and mated with an advanced targeting computer which assists the pilot in hitting other fast-moving starfighters. The fighter does not possess deflector shields, and while it's light armoring is proof against small arms and glancing micrometeoroids a direct hit from a laser cannon will destroy it, encouraging pilots to shoot first and make their shots count. The TIE fighter also lacks a hyperdrive, not only to save on weight and cost but to discourage defection. The TIE fighter's cockpit is not pressurized and doesn't contain life-support systems, though when sealed it will retain whatever atmosphere is already in there, requiring pilots to wear flight suits. TIE fighters are equipped with ejection seats,Windham (2019), p. 106 though in older Legends sources there was disagreement on this issue. Given the inherent delicacy of the craft, an ejection seat would be more a formality than anything else. Star Wars literature also holds that TIE fighter pilots are considered an elite group within the Imperial Navy, relying on their quick reflexes and fearlessness to survive multiple tours of duty. Training involves hundreds of flight hours learning to coordinate as a team and intense psychological conditioning to put the accomplishment of their mission above other considerations.Windham (2019), p. 120 As such most TIE fighter pilots have a life expectancy of less than a year. TIE fighter pilots wear self-contained flight suits with life-support systems connected to reinforced vacuum-sealed flight helmets featuring ship- linked communications and displays.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 271 =TIE variants= In addition to the standard TIE/ln fighter (also available as the TIE Light Duty training craft, as seen in the Jump to Lightspeed expansion pack to Star Wars Galaxies), a variety of other TIE craft appear throughout the films. ;In Star Wars Film and Television *TIE Advanced x1: Darth Vader flies a TIE Advanced x1 (or just \\"TIE/x1\\") in many media, most notably in the original Star Wars during the climatic Death Star battle. According to background material, the limited-run TIE Advanced x1 was designed to Vader's personal specifications and was only flown by himself and select Imperial pilots. Compared to the TIE fighter it is faster and more maneuverable with greater structural integrity, equipped with a deflector shield, hyperdrive, reinforced armor-plated hull and improved SFS L-s9.3 laser cannons. The \\"bent- wing\\" configuration was intended to improve energy collection while maintaining the same speed and maneuverability.Windham (2019), p. 50-53 A TIE/sa bomber *TIE/sa Bomber: Introduced in The Empire Strikes Back, TIE/sa bombers are seen bombing asteroids in the hunt for the Millennium Falcon. The design stems from an unused \\"TIE boarding craft\\" concept originally developed for A New Hope. The TIE bomber's double-hull design led ILM's modelmakers to dub the ship a \\"double chili dog\\" fighter. The TIE/sa, or TIE Surface Assault Bomber, was designed within the Star Wars universe for the Imperial Navy to conduct surgical strikes against targets in space or on planetary surfaces. It features two cylindrical pods: the starboard-side pod housing the pilot in a pressurized cockpit with a pair of L-s1 laser cannons, and a port-side pod carrying two bomb bays that can launch a variety of ordnance including missiles, bombs and orbital mines. Its \\"bent-wing\\" configuration increased the energy-collection surface area to match the bomber's power requirements while a reinforced hull allowed the bomber survive back-blast during atmospheric bombing.Windham (2019), p. 34-36 *TIE/sh Shuttle: Also featured in The Empire Strikes Back, a TIE/sh shuttle is seen ferrying Captain Needa (Michael Culver) to Darth Vader's Super Star Destroyer. Like the TIE/sa bomber, this shuttle design stems from an unused \\"TIE boarding craft\\" concept developed for A New Hope. Known also within the setting as the TIE Command Shuttle, the craft was based on the TIE/sa bomber but replaced the bombardier pod with a luxurious cabin suitable for Imperial dignitaries and naval officers. In the event the vessel is attacked, the TIE shuttle carries a pair of laser cannons and deflector shields.Windham (2019), p. 42-45 A TIE/IN interceptor *TIE/in Interceptor: TIE/in interceptors ‚Äî faster TIE fighters with dagger-shaped wings in the forward profile of those of the TIE Advanced and four laser cannons ‚Äî appear at various points in Return of the Jedi. Two scales of TIE interceptor models were used during filming. Their in-universe origin was to meet the Empire's requirement for a fighter superior to the Rebellion's X-wing and Y-wing fleet when it was determined a full production run of the TIE Advanced x1 would be too expensive. Faster and more maneuverable than a standard TIE fighter, these interceptors are also better armed with wingtip- mounted L-s9.3 laser cannons with the option to carry two more under the cockpit.Windham (2019), p. 58-61 *TIE Advanced v1: Meant to appear as the prototype precursor to Vader's TIE Advanced x1, the TIE Advanced v1 featured in Star Wars Rebels as craft piloted by the Empire's Inquisitors. The v1's variable-geometry wings, like Darth Maul's shuttle Scimitar's, were inspired by Ralph McQuarrie's original sketches for the x1. The fighters' fictional origin was inspired by the Jedi interceptor flown during the Clone Wars with heavily-armored wings that folded inward. With laser cannons and ion engines more powerful than the TIE fighter, the TIE Advanced v1 also features a projectile launcher with a 20 missile magazine, deflector shields and pressurized cockpit.Windham (2019), p. 46-49 *TIE/d Defender: The TIE/d Defender made its television debut in Star Wars Rebels, although it first appeared in the 1994 space flight simulator Star Wars: TIE Fighter as player- pilotable craft. In the previous Star Wars Legends continuity, the TIE Defender was originally designed by Admiral Zaarin, who in the 1994 game would betray the Empire and have to be defeated by the player character. Its background was later changed in Star Wars Rebels to being designed personally by Grand Admiral Thrawn. Classified as a fighter-bomber, its unique tri-wing design gives it better visibility than a TIE interceptor while making it faster than all previous TIE models. Each wing is equipped with maneuvering jets and a pair of L-s9.3 laser cannons, with another pair and twin projectile launchers fitted on the cockpit pod. The TIE/d Defender also carries deflector shields and a hyperdrive.Windham (2019), p. 62-65 *TIE/sk x1 Striker: The TIE/sk x1 experimental air superiority fighter, also known as the TIE Striker, made its first appearance in Rogue One defending the Imperial base on Scarif. Background material on the model describes how it was specifically designed for atmospheric patrols of Imperial ground installations because of the standard TIE fighter's disadvantage in atmospheric combat. With its more aerodynamic design and specialized repulsorlift engines, the TIE Striker can fly faster than a TIE fighter or X-wing in an atmosphere and is heavily armed with four L-s9.3 laser cannons, two H-s1 heavy laser cannons, and a bomb bay. Its spacious cockpit can hold a pilot and an optional gunner/bombardier.Windham (2019), p. 70-73 *TIE/rp Reaper: The TIE/rp Reaper Attack Lander also made its first appearance in Rogue One as support craft with a larger, more angular design that replaces the spherical cockpit found on most TIE fighters. Within the Star Wars universe, these craft were based on the TIE/sk x1 Striker with similar wing configuration but much larger in order to carry elite Imperial troops into battle. The TIE/rp Reaper features armor plating, deflector shields and electronic countermeasures to ensure it can survive hostile airspace to deliver its cargo. It also carries a hyperdrive for faster-than-light travel and a pair of L-s9.3 laser cannons.Windham (2019), p. 74-77 *TIE Boarding Craft: The TIE Boarding Craft made its theatrical appearance in Rogue One. The design was originally set to appear in the original Star Wars but was cut from the film and used as inspiration for the TIE bomber and TIE shuttle. Background literature states that the TIE Boarding Craft shared many of the same features as the TIE bomber but with seating for twelve passengers and a boarding hatch equipped with laser cutters. Other equipment included deflector shields, twin L-s1 laser cannons, twin H-s1 heavy laser cannons and missile launcher.Windham (2019), p 38-41 *TIE/rb Heavy Starfighter: The TIE/rb, known also as the TIE Brute, first appeared in Solo: A Star Wars Story chasing the Millennium Falcon during the Kessel Run scene. Star Wars literature states that the TIE/rb was commissioned to help deal with pirates, smugglers and other outlaws operating in the Outer Rim. Larger than a standard TIE fighter, the TIE/rb features heavier armor plating and carries a pair of H-s9.3 laser cannons - nearly twice as powerful as a TIE fighter's cannons - on a separate artillery pod. Because it was sluggish to fly, the TIE Brute features an integrated droid intelligence to assist the pilot.Windham (2019), p. 30-33 *TIE/fo space superiority fighter: The Force Awakens features the First Order TIE/fo space superiority fighter, which is superficially similar to the Empire's original TIE fighter but with several technological upgrades. Built by Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems, it features superior firepower, speed and maneuverability with a pair of SJSF L-s9.6 laser cannons and twin SJFS P-s6 ion engines aided by superior solar cell wings and higher-capacity energy converters. Perhaps the biggest difference is the fact that the TIE/fo features deflector shields - a recognition by the First Order that compared to the Galactic Empire it must take measures to safeguard its more limited supply of pilots.Windham (2019), p. 82-87 *TIE/sf space superiority fighter: Also featured in The Force Awakens is the TIE/sf fighter, one of which is hijacked by Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) as they escape the First Order. Piloted by members of the First Order Special Forces, this model is superior to the First Order's TIE/fo. It is equipped with a hyperdrive, superior shielding, twin ion reactors, a pair of forward-facing L-s9.6 laser cannons, an aft Lb-14 dual heavy laser turret with full 360-degree rotation, and a missile/mag-pulse launcher.Windham (2019), p. 92-95 *TIE/vn Silencer: First appearing in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the TIE/vn Silencer is the Interceptor-winged personal starfighter of Kylo Ren. *TIE/wi Whisper: Kylo Ren flies a custom-model TIE/wi fighter in The Rise of Skywalker. *TIE/dg Dagger: Also known as the Sith TIE fighter, the TIE Dagger featured in The Rise of Skywalker as a red triangular- wing model of TIE fighter forged in secret for forces operating under the reborn Emperor Palpatine. ;In Star Wars Legends continuity A number of different TIE designs made their appearance in what is now considered Star Wars Legends, a separate continuity that was split off after Disney acquired the Star Wars franchise. The TIE/sa was the inspiration for the triple-hulled TIE lander, featured in Star Wars #60 and in Star Wars: Complete Locations. Red-modified TIE interceptors are also used by the Emperor's Royal Guards, as featured in Rage of the Wookiees, another expansion of Star Wars Galaxies. Additionally, LucasArts Star Wars video games introduce several TIE variants, such as the TIE Hunter starfighter in Rogue Squadron III and the TIE Mauler surface vehicle in Empire at War. Gallery -> The Armies -> TIE Mauler The TIE/ad fighter (nicknamed \\"TIE Advanced\\" or \\"Avenger\\" in-game and derived from Vader's TIE Advanced x1 fighter) and TIE/D Defender ‚Äî heavily upgraded derivatives of previous craft seen in the Star Wars universe ‚Äî first appear in TIE Fighter as player-pilotable craft. The plot of Rebel Assault II revolves around destroying the Empire's ability to manufacture the cloaking TIE Phantom starfighter, and a campaign in X-Wing Alliance centers on destroying experimental remote-controlled TIE fighters. Star Wars literature also introduces TIE varieties. TIE raptors attack Rogue Squadron in Solo Command. TYE wings ‚Äî TIE fighter and Y-wing hybrids ‚Äî appear both in I, Jedi and Rogue Squadron: Masquerade. Dark Horse's Dark Empire introduces both the droid- piloted TIE/D and the TIE crawler \\"century tank\\". West End Games' roleplaying sourcebooks introduce varieties that include the TIE/fc fire-control support ship, the TIE/gt ground-attack fighter, the TIE/rc reconnaissance vessel, and the TIE scout.  Cultural impact  A TIE fighter model used in filming the climax of Star Wars sold at auction for $350,000, and another TIE fighter from the film sold at auction for $402,500. Fans built a 16-foot-by-20-foot, 1,000-pound TIE fighter float to commemorate Star Wars' thirtieth anniversary as part of the 2007 Gala Parade in Crystal Lake, Illinois. A Wired editor's creation of a TIE fighter model out of Starbucks cups and stirrers prompted the magazine to create a contest for its readers to submit their own art out of similar Starbucks material. io9 mocked the variety of TIE fighters in the franchise, listing four TIE models on its list of the eleven \\"silliest\\" Star Wars ships. Kenner released TIE fighter and TIE interceptor toys during the original Star Wars trilogy's theatrical release, and Kenner's die-cast TIE bomber is a rare collector's item. Hasbro also released TIE fighter, TIE bomber, and TIE interceptor toys. Both Kenner and Hasbro also manufactured TIE fighter pilot action figures. Lego manufactured TIE fighter, TIE bomber, TIE interceptor, TIE defender, and TIE advanced models. Decipher and Wizards of the Coast published various TIE starfighter and TIE-related cards for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game and Star Wars Trading Card Game, respectively. In 2012, Fantasy Flight Games released Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game, a miniatures game with pre-painted and to scale miniature X-wings and TIE fighters. In 1994, LucasArts released the TIE Fighter flight simulator, which casts the player as an Imperial pilot flying a variety of TIE starfighters. TIE starfighters and their variants are also playable in third- or first- person perspectives in several Star Wars titles. In 2018, a number of Star Wars starfighters had their aerodynamic abilities tested using the Autodesk Flow Design virtual wind tunnel program. Of those studied, the TIE Fighter scored the worst with a drag coefficient of .98, which is only slightly better than a brick. The TIE interceptor was slightly better with a coefficient of .78, while the TIE Striker had the best at .48, though this did not compare favorably to the .02 drag coefficient of an F-4E Phantom. These poor results were rationalized with the in-universe explanations that drag coefficient plays no role in space travel, and that Star Wars fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector shields to give themselves better flight profiles.

They may have difficulty falling asleep, or staying asleep as long as desired. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. It may result in an increased risk of motor vehicle collisions, as well as problems focusing and learning. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month. Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, restless leg syndrome, menopause, certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Other risk factors include working night shifts and sleep apnea. Diagnosis is based on sleep habits and an examination to look for underlying causes. A sleep study may be done to look for underlying sleep disorders. Screening may be done with two questions: \\"do you experience difficulty sleeping?\\" and \\"do you have difficulty falling or staying asleep?\\" Sleep hygiene and lifestyle changes are typically the first treatment for insomnia. Sleep hygiene includes a consistent bedtime, exposure to sunlight, a quiet and dark room, and regular exercise. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be added to this. While sleeping pills may help, they are associated with injuries, dementia, and addiction. These medications are not recommended for more than four or five weeks. The effectiveness and safety of alternative medicine is unclear. Between 10% and 30% of adults have insomnia at any given point in time and up to half of people have insomnia in a given year. About 6% of people have insomnia that is not due to another problem and lasts for more than a month. People over the age of 65 are affected more often than younger people. Females are more often affected than males. Descriptions of insomnia occur at least as far back as ancient Greece.  Signs and symptoms  Potential complications of insomnia.Insomnia > Complications . Mayo Clinic. Retrieved on May 5, 2009 Symptoms of insomnia: *Difficulty falling asleep, including difficulty finding a comfortable sleeping position *Waking during the night, being unable to return to sleep and waking up early *Not able to focus on daily tasks, difficulty in remembering *Daytime sleepiness, irritability, depression or anxiety *Feeling tired or having low energy during the day *Trouble concentrating *Being irritable, acting aggressive or impulsive Sleep onset insomnia is difficulty falling asleep at the beginning of the night, often a symptom of anxiety disorders. Delayed sleep phase disorder can be misdiagnosed as insomnia, as sleep onset is delayed to much later than normal while awakening spills over into daylight hours It is common for patients who have difficulty falling asleep to also have nocturnal awakenings with difficulty returning to sleep. Two-thirds of these patients wake up in the middle of the night, with more than half having trouble falling back to sleep after a middle-of-the-night awakening. Early morning awakening is an awakening occurring earlier (more than 30 minutes) than desired with an inability to go back to sleep, and before total sleep time reaches 6.5 hours. Early morning awakening is often a characteristic of depression. Anxiety symptoms may well lead to Insomnia. Some of these symptoms include tension, compulsive worrying about the future, feeling overstimulated, and overanalyzing past events = Poor sleep quality = Poor sleep quality can occur as a result of, for example, restless legs, sleep apnea or major depression. Poor sleep quality is defined as the individual not reaching stage 3 or delta sleep which has restorative properties. Major depression leads to alterations in the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, causing excessive release of cortisol which can lead to poor sleep quality. Nocturnal polyuria, excessive nighttime urination, can be very disturbing to sleep. = Subjectivity = Some cases of insomnia are not really insomnia in the traditional sense, because people experiencing sleep state misperception often sleep for a normal amount of time. The problem is that, despite sleeping for multiple hours each night and typically not experiencing significant daytime sleepiness or other symptoms of sleep loss, they do not feel like they have slept very much, if at all. Because their perception of their sleep is incomplete, they incorrectly believe it takes them an abnormally long time to fall asleep, and they underestimate how long they remain asleep.  Causes  Symptoms of insomnia can be caused by or be associated with: *Sleep breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea or upper airway resistance syndrome. *Use of psychoactive drugs (such as stimulants), including certain medications, herbs, caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamines, methylphenidate, aripiprazole, MDMA, modafinil, or excessive alcohol intake. *Use of or withdrawal from alcohol and other sedatives, such as anti-anxiety and sleep drugs like benzodiazepines. *Use of or withdrawal from pain-relievers such as opioids. *Heart disease. *Restless legs syndrome, which can cause sleep onset insomnia due to the discomforting sensations felt and the need to move the legs or other body parts to relieve these sensations. *Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), which occurs during sleep and can cause arousals of which the sleeper is unaware. *Pain, an injury or condition that causes pain can preclude an individual from finding a comfortable position in which to fall asleep, and can in addition cause awakening. *Hormone shifts such as those that precede menstruation and those during menopause. *Life events such as fear, stress, anxiety, emotional or mental tension, work problems, financial stress, birth of a child, and bereavement. *Gastrointestinal issues such as heartburn or constipation. *Mental disorders such as bipolar disorder, clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, dementia, and ADHD. *Disturbances of the circadian rhythm, such as shift work and jet lag, can cause an inability to sleep at some times of the day and excessive sleepiness at other times of the day. Chronic circadian rhythm disorders are characterized by similar symptoms. * Certain neurological disorders, brain lesions, or a history of traumatic brain injury. *Medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism *Abuse of over-the counter or prescription sleep aids (sedative or depressant drugs) can produce rebound insomnia. *Poor sleep hygiene, e.g., noise or over-consumption of caffeine. *A rare genetic condition can cause a prion-based, permanent and eventually fatal form of insomnia called fatal familial insomnia. *Physical exercise. Exercise-induced insomnia is common in athletes in the form of prolonged sleep onset latency.The epidemiological survey of exercise-induced insomnia in chinese athletes Youqi Shi, Zhihong Zhou, Ke Ning, Jianhong LIU. Athens 2004: Pre-Olympic Congress. *Increased exposure to the blue light from artificial sources, such as phones or computers *Chronic pain *Lower back pain *Asthma Sleep studies using polysomnography have suggested that people who have sleep disruption have elevated nighttime levels of circulating cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. They also have an elevated metabolic rate, which does not occur in people who do not have insomnia but whose sleep is intentionally disrupted during a sleep study. Studies of brain metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) scans indicate that people with insomnia have higher metabolic rates by night and by day. The question remains whether these changes are the causes or consequences of long-term insomnia. = Genetics = Heritability estimates of insomnia vary between 38% in males to 59% in females. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 3 genomic loci and 7 genes that influence the risk of insomnia, and showed that insomnia is highly polygenic. In particular, a strong positive association was observed for the MEIS1 gene in both males and females. This study showed that the genetic architecture of insomnia strongly overlaps with psychiatric disorders and metabolic traits. It has been hypothesised that the epigenetics might also influence insomnia through a controlling process of both sleep regulation and brain-stress response having an impact as well on the brain plasticity. = Substance-induced =  Alcohol-induced  Alcohol is often used as a form of self-treatment of insomnia to induce sleep. However, alcohol use to induce sleep can be a cause of insomnia. Long-term use of alcohol is associated with a decrease in NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. Frequent moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches, the need to urinate, dehydration, and excessive sweating. Glutamine rebound also plays a role as when someone is drinking; alcohol inhibits glutamine, one of the body's natural stimulants. When the person stops drinking, the body tries to make up for lost time by producing more glutamine than it needs. The increase in glutamine levels stimulates the brain while the drinker is trying to sleep, keeping him/her from reaching the deepest levels of sleep. Stopping chronic alcohol use can also lead to severe insomnia with vivid dreams. During withdrawal REM sleep is typically exaggerated as part of a rebound effect.  Benzodiazepine-induced  Like alcohol, benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam, are commonly used to treat insomnia in the short-term (both prescribed and self-medicated), but worsen sleep in the long-term. While benzodiazepines can put people to sleep (i.e., inhibit NREM stage 1 and 2 sleep), while asleep, the drugs disrupt sleep architecture: decreasing sleep time, delaying time to REM sleep, and decreasing deep slow-wave sleep (the most restorative part of sleep for both energy and mood).  Opioid-induced  Opioid medications such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, and morphine are used for insomnia that is associated with pain due to their analgesic properties and hypnotic effects. Opioids can fragment sleep and decrease REM and stage 2 sleep. By producing analgesia and sedation, opioids may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with pain-associated insomnia. However, dependence on opioids can lead to long-term sleep disturbances. = Risk factors = Insomnia affects people of all age groups but people in the following groups have a higher chance of acquiring insomnia. *Individuals older than 60 *History of mental health disorder including depression, etc. *Emotional stress *Working late night shifts *Traveling through different time zones *Having chronic diseases such as diabetes, kidney disease, lung disease, Alzheimer's, or heart disease *Alcohol or drug use disorders *Gastrointestinal reflux disease *Heavy smoking *Work stressLichstein, K. L., Taylor, D. J., McCrae, C. S., & Petrov, M. (2010). Insomnia: Epidemiology and Risk Factors. Principles and Practice of Sleep Medicine: Fifth Edition, 827‚Äì37.  Mechanism  Two main models exists as to the mechanism of insomnia, (1) cognitive and (2) physiological. The cognitive model suggests rumination and hyperarousal contribute to preventing a person from falling asleep and might lead to an episode of insomnia. The physiological model is based upon three major findings in people with insomnia; firstly, increased urinary cortisol and catecholamines have been found suggesting increased activity of the HPA axis and arousal; second increased global cerebral glucose utilization during wakefulness and NREM sleep in people with insomnia; and lastly increased full body metabolism and heart rate in those with insomnia. All these findings taken together suggest a dysregulation of the arousal system, cognitive system, and HPA axis all contributing to insomnia. However, it is unknown if the hyperarousal is a result of, or cause of insomnia. Altered levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA have been found, but the results have been inconsistent, and the implications of altered levels of such a ubiquitous neurotransmitter are unknown. Studies on whether insomnia is driven by circadian control over sleep or a wake dependent process have shown inconsistent results, but some literature suggests a dysregulation of the circadian rhythm based on core temperature. Increased beta activity and decreased delta wave activity has been observed on electroencephalograms; however, the implication of this is unknown. Around half of post-menopausal women experience sleep disturbances, and generally sleep disturbance is about twice as common in women as men; this appears to be due in part, but not completely, to changes in hormone levels, especially in and post-menopause. Changes in sex hormones in both men and women as they age may account in part for increased prevalence of sleep disorders in older people.  Diagnosis  In medicine, insomnia is widely measured using the Athens insomnia scale. It is measured using eight different parameters related to sleep, finally represented as an overall scale which assesses an individual's sleep pattern. A qualified sleep specialist should be consulted for the diagnosis of any sleep disorder so the appropriate measures can be taken. Past medical history and a physical examination need to be done to eliminate other conditions that could be the cause of insomnia. After all other conditions are ruled out a comprehensive sleep history should be taken. The sleep history should include sleep habits, medications (prescription and non-prescription), alcohol consumption, nicotine and caffeine intake, co-morbid illnesses, and sleep environment.Passarella, S, Duong, M. \\"Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia.\\" 2008. A sleep diary can be used to keep track of the individual's sleep patterns. The diary should include time to bed, total sleep time, time to sleep onset, number of awakenings, use of medications, time of awakening, and subjective feelings in the morning. The sleep diary can be replaced or validated by the use of out-patient actigraphy for a week or more, using a non-invasive device that measures movement. Workers who complain of insomnia should not routinely have polysomnography to screen for sleep disorders. This test may be indicated for patients with symptoms in addition to insomnia, including sleep apnea, obesity, a thick neck diameter, or high-risk fullness of the flesh in the oropharynx. Usually, the test is not needed to make a diagnosis, and insomnia especially for working people can often be treated by changing a job schedule to make time for sufficient sleep and by improving sleep hygiene. Some patients may need to do an overnight sleep study to determine if insomnia is present. Such a study will commonly involve assessment tools including a polysomnogram and the multiple sleep latency test. Specialists in sleep medicine are qualified to diagnose disorders within the, according to the ICSD, 81 major sleep disorder diagnostic categories. Patients with some disorders, including delayed sleep phase disorder, are often mis-diagnosed with primary insomnia; when a person has trouble getting to sleep and awakening at desired times, but has a normal sleep pattern once asleep, a circadian rhythm disorder is a likely cause. In many cases, insomnia is co-morbid with another disease, side-effects from medications, or a psychological problem. Approximately half of all diagnosed insomnia is related to psychiatric disorders. In depression in many cases \\"insomnia should be regarded as a co-morbid condition, rather than as a secondary one;\\" insomnia typically predates psychiatric symptoms. \\"In fact, it is possible that insomnia represents a significant risk for the development of a subsequent psychiatric disorder.\\" Insomnia occurs in between 60% and 80% of people with depression. This may partly be due to treatment used for depression. Determination of causation is not necessary for a diagnosis. = DSM-5 criteria = The DSM-5 criteria for insomnia include the following:\\"Sleep Wake Disorders.\\" Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5. Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Association, 2013. Predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality, associated with one (or more) of the following symptoms: *Difficulty initiating sleep. (In children, this may manifest as difficulty initiating sleep without caregiver intervention.) *Difficulty maintaining sleep, characterized by frequent awakenings or problems returning to sleep after awakenings. (In children, this may manifest as difficulty returning to sleep without caregiver intervention.) *Early-morning awakening with inability to return to sleep. In addition, *The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or other important areas of functioning. *The sleep difficulty occurs at least 3 nights per week. *The sleep difficulty is present for at least 3 months. *The sleep difficulty occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. *The insomnia is not better explained by and does not occur exclusively during the course of another sleep-wake disorder (e.g., narcolepsy, a breathing-related sleep disorder, a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, a parasomnia). *The insomnia is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication). *Coexisting mental disorders and medical conditions do not adequately explain the predominant complaint of insomnia. = Types = Insomnia can be classified as transient, acute, or chronic. #Transient insomnia lasts for less than a week. It can be caused by another disorder, by changes in the sleep environment, by the timing of sleep, severe depression, or by stress. Its consequences ‚Äì sleepiness and impaired psychomotor performance ‚Äì are similar to those of sleep deprivation. #Acute insomnia is the inability to consistently sleep well for a period of less than a month. Insomnia is present when there is difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or when the sleep that is obtained is non-refreshing or of poor quality. These problems occur despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep and they must result in problems with daytime function. Acute insomnia is also known as short term insomnia or stress related insomnia. #Chronic insomnia lasts for longer than a month. It can be caused by another disorder, or it can be a primary disorder. People with high levels of stress hormones or shifts in the levels of cytokines are more likely than others to have chronic insomnia. Its effects can vary according to its causes. They might include muscular weariness, hallucinations, and/or mental fatigue. Prevention Prevention and treatment of insomnia may require a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy, medications, and lifestyle changes. Among lifestyle practices, going to sleep and waking up at the same time each day can create a steady pattern which may help to prevent insomnia. Avoidance of vigorous exercise and caffeinated drinks a few hours before going to sleep is recommended, while exercise earlier in the day may be beneficial. Other practices to improve sleep hygiene may include: * Avoiding or limiting naps * Treating pain at bedtime * Avoiding large meals, beverages, alcohol, and nicotine before bedtime * Finding soothing ways to relax into sleep, including use of white noise * Making the bedroom suitable for sleep by keeping it dark, cool, and free of devices, such as clocks, a cell phone, or television * Maintain regular exercise * Try relaxing activities before sleeping * Use your bed only for sleep or sex * Stop checking the time  Management  It is recommended to rule out medical and psychological causes before deciding on the treatment for insomnia. Cognitive behavioral therapy is generally the first line treatment once this has been done. It has been found to be effective for chronic insomnia. The beneficial effects, in contrast to those produced by medications, may last well beyond the stopping of therapy. Medications have been used mainly to reduce symptoms in insomnia of short duration; their role in the management of chronic insomnia remains unclear. Several different types of medications may be used. Many doctors do not recommend relying on prescription sleeping pills for long-term use. It is also important to identify and treat other medical conditions that may be contributing to insomnia, such as depression, breathing problems, and chronic pain. Many people with insomnia remain insufficiently treated as of 2003. = Non- medication based = Non-medication based strategies have comparable efficacy to hypnotic medication for insomnia and they may have longer lasting effects. Hypnotic medication is only recommended for short-term use because dependence with rebound withdrawal effects upon discontinuation or tolerance can develop.National Prescribing Service (2010-02-01). \\"Addressing hypnotic medicines use in primary care\\" . NPS News, Vol. 67. Non medication based strategies provide long lasting improvements to insomnia and are recommended as a first line and long-term strategy of management. Behavioral sleep medicine (BSM) tries to address insomnia with non-pharmacological treatments. The BSM strategies used to address chronic insomnia include attention to sleep hygiene, stimulus control, behavioral interventions, sleep-restriction therapy, paradoxical intention, patient education, and relaxation therapy. Some examples are keeping a journal, restricting the time spent awake in bed, practicing relaxation techniques, and maintaining a regular sleep schedule and a wake-up time. Behavioral therapy can assist a patient in developing new sleep behaviors to improve sleep quality and consolidation. Behavioral therapy may include, learning healthy sleep habits to promote sleep relaxation, undergoing light therapy to help with worry-reduction strategies and regulating the circadian clock. Music may improve insomnia in adults (see music and sleep). EEG biofeedback has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of insomnia with improvements in duration as well as quality of sleep. Self-help therapy (defined as a psychological therapy that can be worked through on one's own) may improve sleep quality for adults with insomnia to a small or moderate degree. Stimulus control therapy is a treatment for patients who have conditioned themselves to associate the bed, or sleep in general, with a negative response. As stimulus control therapy involves taking steps to control the sleep environment, it is sometimes referred interchangeably with the concept of sleep hygiene. Examples of such environmental modifications include using the bed for sleep or sex only, not for activities such as reading or watching television; waking up at the same time every morning, including on weekends; going to bed only when sleepy and when there is a high likelihood that sleep will occur; leaving the bed and beginning an activity in another location if sleep does not result in a reasonably brief period of time after getting into bed (commonly ~20 min); reducing the subjective effort and energy expended trying to fall asleep; avoiding exposure to bright light during nighttime hours, and eliminating daytime naps. A component of stimulus control therapy is sleep restriction, a technique that aims to match the time spent in bed with actual time spent asleep. This technique involves maintaining a strict sleep-wake schedule, sleeping only at certain times of the day and for specific amounts of time to induce mild sleep deprivation. Complete treatment usually lasts up to 3 weeks and involves making oneself sleep for only a minimum amount of time that they are actually capable of on average, and then, if capable (i.e. when sleep efficiency improves), slowly increasing this amount (~15 min) by going to bed earlier as the body attempts to reset its internal sleep clock. Bright light therapy may be effective for insomnia. Paradoxical intention is a cognitive reframing technique where the insomniac, instead of attempting to fall asleep at night, makes every effort to stay awake (i.e. essentially stops trying to fall asleep). One theory that may explain the effectiveness of this method is that by not voluntarily making oneself go to sleep, it relieves the performance anxiety that arises from the need or requirement to fall asleep, which is meant to be a passive act. This technique has been shown to reduce sleep effort and performance anxiety and also lower subjective assessment of sleep-onset latency and overestimation of the sleep deficit (a quality found in many insomniacs).  Sleep hygiene  Sleep hygiene is a common term for all of the behaviors which relate to the promotion of good sleep. They include habits which provide a good foundation for sleep and help to prevent insomnia. However, sleep hygiene alone may not be adequate to address chronic insomnia. Sleep hygiene recommendations are typically included as one component of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Recommendations include reducing caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol consumption, maximizing the regularity and efficiency of sleep episodes, minimizing medication usage and daytime napping, the promotion of regular exercise, and the facilitation of a positive sleep environment. Exercise can be helpful when establishing a routine for sleep but should not be done close to the time that you are planning on going to sleep. The creation of a positive sleep environment may also be helpful in reducing the symptoms of insomnia. In order to create a positive sleep environment one should remove objects that can cause worry or distressful thoughts from view.  Cognitive behavioral therapy  There is some evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is superior in the long-term to benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepines in the treatment and management of insomnia. In this therapy, patients are taught improved sleep habits and relieved of counter- productive assumptions about sleep. Common misconceptions and expectations that can be modified include # unrealistic sleep expectations (e.g., I need to have 8 hours of sleep each night) # misconceptions about insomnia causes (e.g., I have a chemical imbalance causing my insomnia) # amplifying the consequences of insomnia (e.g., I cannot do anything after a bad night's sleep) and # performance anxiety after trying for so long to have a good night's sleep by controlling the sleep process. Numerous studies have reported positive outcomes of combining cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia treatment with treatments such as stimulus control and the relaxation therapies. Hypnotic medications are equally effective in the short-term treatment of insomnia, but their effects wear off over time due to tolerance. The effects of CBT-I have sustained and lasting effects on treating insomnia long after therapy has been discontinued. The addition of hypnotic medications with CBT-I adds no benefit in insomnia. The long lasting benefits of a course of CBT-I shows superiority over pharmacological hypnotic drugs. Even in the short term when compared to short-term hypnotic medication such as zolpidem, CBT-I still shows significant superiority. Thus CBT-I is recommended as a first line treatment for insomnia. CBT is the well-accepted form of therapy for insomnia since it has no known adverse effects, whereas taking medications to alleviate insomnia symptoms have been shown to have adverse side effects. Nevertheless, the downside of CBT is that it may take a lot of time and motivation. Metacognition is a recent trend in approach to behaviour therapy of insomnia.  Internet interventions  Despite the therapeutic effectiveness and proven success of CBT, treatment availability is significantly limited by a lack of trained clinicians, poor geographical distribution of knowledgeable professionals, and expense. One way to potentially overcome these barriers is to use the Internet to deliver treatment, making this effective intervention more accessible and less costly. The Internet has already become a critical source of health-care and medical information. Although the vast majority of health websites provide general information, there is growing research literature on the development and evaluation of Internet interventions. These online programs are typically behaviorally-based treatments that have been operationalized and transformed for delivery via the Internet. They are usually highly structured; automated or human supported; based on effective face-to-face treatment; personalized to the user; interactive; enhanced by graphics, animations, audio, and possibly video; and tailored to provide follow-up and feedback. There is good evidence for the use of computer based CBT for insomnia. = Medications = Many people with insomnia use sleeping tablets and other sedatives. In some places medications are prescribed in over 95% of cases. They, however, are a second line treatment. In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration stated it is going to require warnings for eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem, due to concerns about serious injuries resulting from abnormal sleep behaviors, including sleepwalking or driving a vehicle while asleep. The percentage of adults using a prescription sleep aid increases with age. During 2005‚Äì2010, about 4% of U.S. adults aged 20 and over reported that they took prescription sleep aids in the past 30 days. Rates of use were lowest among the youngest age group (those aged 20‚Äì39) at about 2%, increased to 6% among those aged 50‚Äì59, and reached 7% among those aged 80 and over. More adult women (5%) reported using prescription sleep aids than adult men (3%). Non-Hispanic white adults reported higher use of sleep aids (5%) than non-Hispanic black (3%) and Mexican-American (2%) adults. No difference was shown between non-Hispanic black adults and Mexican-American adults in use of prescription sleep aids.Chong Y., Fryar, C.D., and Gu, Q. (2013). Prescription Sleep Aid Use Among Adults: United States, 2005‚Äì2010. Hyattsville, Md.: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics.  Antihistamines  As an alternative to taking prescription drugs, some evidence shows that an average person seeking short-term help may find relief by taking over-the-counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or doxylamine. Diphenhydramine and doxylamine are widely used in nonprescription sleep aids. They are the most effective over-the-counter sedatives currently available, at least in much of Europe, Canada, Australia, and the United States, and are more sedating than some prescription hypnotics.DrugBank: DB00366 (Doxylamine) . Drugbank.ca. Retrieved on 2011-11-20. Antihistamine effectiveness for sleep may decrease over time, and anticholinergic side-effects (such as dry mouth) may also be a drawback with these particular drugs. While addiction does not seem to be an issue with this class of drugs, they can induce dependence and rebound effects upon abrupt cessation of use. However, people whose insomnia is caused by restless legs syndrome may have worsened symptoms with antihistamines.  Melatonin  The evidence for melatonin in treating insomnia is generally poor. There is low quality evidence that it may speed the onset of sleep by 6 minutes. Ramelteon, a melatonin receptor agonist, does not appear to speed the onset of sleep or the amount of sleep a person gets. Most melatonin drugs have not been tested for longitudinal side effects. Prolonged-release melatonin may improve quality of sleep in older people with minimal side effects. Studies have also shown that children who are on the Autism spectrum or have learning disabilities, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or related neurological diseases can benefit from the use of melatonin. This is because they often have trouble sleeping due to their disorders. For example, children with ADHD tend to have trouble falling asleep because of their hyperactivity and, as a result, tend to be tired during most of the day. Another cause of insomnia in children with ADHD is the use of stimulants used to treat their disorder. Children who have ADHD then, as well as the other disorders mentioned, may be given melatonin before bedtime in order to help them sleep.  Antidepressants  While insomnia is a common symptom of depression, antidepressants are effective for treating sleep problems whether or not they are associated with depression. While all antidepressants help regulate sleep, some antidepressants such as amitriptyline, doxepin, mirtazapine, and trazodone can have an immediate sedative effect, and are prescribed to treat insomnia. Amitriptyline and doxepin both have antihistaminergic, anticholinergic, and antiadrenergic properties, which contribute to both their therapeutic effects and side effect profiles, while mirtazapine's side effects are primarily antihistaminergic, and trazodone's side-effects are primarily antiadrenergic. Mirtazapine is known to decrease sleep latency (i.e., the time it takes to fall asleep), promoting sleep efficiency and increasing the total amount of sleeping time in people with both depression and insomnia. Agomelatine, a melatonergic antidepressant with sleep-improving qualities that does not cause daytime drowsiness, is licensed for marketing in the European Union and TGA Australia. After trials in the United States its development for use there was discontinued in October 2011Novartis drops future blockbuster agomelatine. Scrip Intelligence, Oct 25 2011 (retrieved Oct 30, 2011). by Novartis, who had bought the rights to market it there from the European pharmaceutical company Servier. A 2018 Cochrane review found the safety of taking antidepressants for insomnia to be uncertain with no evidence supporting long term use.  Benzodiazepines  Normison (temazepam) is a benzodiazepine commonly prescribed for insomnia and other sleep disorders.Temazepam . Websters-online-dictionary.org. Retrieved on 2011-11-20. The most commonly used class of hypnotics for insomnia are the benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are not significantly better for insomnia than antidepressants. Chronic users of hypnotic medications for insomnia do not have better sleep than chronic insomniacs not taking medications. In fact, chronic users of hypnotic medications have more regular nighttime awakenings than insomniacs not taking hypnotic medications. Many have concluded that these drugs cause an unjustifiable risk to the individual and to public health and lack evidence of long-term effectiveness. It is preferred that hypnotics be prescribed for only a few days at the lowest effective dose and avoided altogether wherever possible, especially in the elderly. Between 1993 and 2010, the prescribing of benzodiazepines to individuals with sleep disorders has decreased from 24% to 11% in the US, coinciding with the first release of nonbenzodiazepines. The benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic medications also have a number of side-effects such as day time fatigue, motor vehicle crashes and other accidents, cognitive impairments, and falls and fractures. Elderly people are more sensitive to these side-effects. Some benzodiazepines have demonstrated effectiveness in sleep maintenance in the short term but in the longer term benzodiazepines can lead to tolerance, physical dependence, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome upon discontinuation, and long-term worsening of sleep, especially after consistent usage over long periods of time. Benzodiazepines, while inducing unconsciousness, actually worsen sleep as ‚Äì like alcohol ‚Äì they promote light sleep while decreasing time spent in deep sleep. A further problem is, with regular use of short- acting sleep aids for insomnia, daytime rebound anxiety can emerge. Although there is little evidence for benefit of benzodiazepines in insomnia compared to other treatments and evidence of major harm, prescriptions have continued to increase. This is likely due to their addictive nature, both due to misuse and because ‚Äì through their rapid action, tolerance and withdrawal they can \\"trick\\" insomniacs into thinking they are helping with sleep. There is a general awareness that long-term use of benzodiazepines for insomnia in most people is inappropriate and that a gradual withdrawal is usually beneficial due to the adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines and is recommended whenever possible. Benzodiazepines all bind unselectively to the GABAA receptor. Some theorize that certain benzodiazepines (hypnotic benzodiazepines) have significantly higher activity at the Œ±1 subunit of the GABAA receptor compared to other benzodiazepines (for example, triazolam and temazepam have significantly higher activity at the Œ±1 subunit compared to alprazolam and diazepam, making them superior sedative- hypnotics ‚Äì alprazolam and diazepam, in turn, have higher activity at the Œ±2 subunit compared to triazolam and temazepam, making them superior anxiolytic agents). Modulation of the Œ±1 subunit is associated with sedation, motor impairment, respiratory depression, amnesia, ataxia, and reinforcing behavior (drug-seeking behavior). Modulation of the Œ±2 subunit is associated with anxiolytic activity and disinhibition. For this reason, certain benzodiazepines may be better suited to treat insomnia than others.  Other sedatives  Drugs that may prove more effective and safer than benzodiazepines for insomnia is an area of active research. Nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic drugs, such as zolpidem, zaleplon, zopiclone, and eszopiclone, are a class of hypnotic medications that are similar to benzodiazepines in their mechanism of action, and indicated for mild to moderate insomnia. Their effectiveness at improving time to sleeping is slight, and they have similar ‚Äì though potentially less severe ‚Äì side effect profiles compared to benzodiazepines. Suvorexant is FDA approved for insomnia, characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Prescribing of nonbenzodiazepines has seen a general increase since their initial release on the US market in 1992, from 2.3% in 1993 among individuals with sleep disorders to 13.7% in 2010. Barbiturates, while once used, are no longer recommended for insomnia due to the risk of addiction and other side affects.  Antipsychotics  The use of antipsychotics for insomnia, while common, is not recommended as the evidence does not demonstrate a benefit and the risk of adverse effects is significant., which cites  * Concerns regarding side effects is greater in the elderly. = Alternative medicine = Herbs such as valerian, chamomile, lavender, or cannabis, may be used, but there is no clinical evidence that they are effective. It is unclear if acupuncture is useful.  Prognosis  Disability-adjusted life year for insomnia per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. A survey of 1.1 million residents in the United States found that those that reported sleeping about 7 hours per night had the lowest rates of mortality, whereas those that slept for fewer than 6 hours or more than 8 hours had higher mortality rates. Getting 8.5 or more hours of sleep per night was associated with a 15% higher mortality rate. Severe insomnia ‚Äì sleeping less than 3.5 hours in women and 4.5 hours in men ‚Äì is associated with a 15% increase in mortality. With this technique, it is difficult to distinguish lack of sleep caused by a disorder which is also a cause of premature death, versus a disorder which causes a lack of sleep, and the lack of sleep causing premature death. Most of the increase in mortality from severe insomnia was discounted after controlling for associated disorders. After controlling for sleep duration and insomnia, use of sleeping pills was also found to be associated with an increased mortality rate. The lowest mortality was seen in individuals who slept between six and a half and seven and a half hours per night. Even sleeping only 4.5 hours per night is associated with very little increase in mortality. Thus, mild to moderate insomnia for most people is associated with increased longevity and severe insomnia is associated only with a very small effect on mortality. It is unclear why sleeping longer than 7.5 hours is associated with excess mortality. Epidemiology Between 10% and 30% of adults have insomnia at any given point in time and up to half of people have insomnia in a given year. About 6% of people have insomnia that is not due to another problem and lasts for more than a month. People over the age of 65 are affected more often than younger people. Females are more often affected than males. Insomnia is 40% more common in women than in men. There are higher rates of insomnia reported among university students compared to the general population. Society and culture The word insomnia is from + \\"without sleep\\" and -ia as nominalizing suffix. The popular press have published stories about people who supposedly never sleep, such as that of Th√°i Ng·ªçc, and Al Herpin Horne writes \\"everybody sleeps and needs to do so;\\" and generally this appears true. However, he also relates from contemporary accounts the case of Paul Kern, who was shot in wartime and then \\"never slept again\\" until his death in 1943. Kern appears to be a completely isolated, unique case.

They are depicted as the primary fighter-bombers of the Galactic Republic, Rebel Alliance, New Republic, and the Resistance; being ideally suited for anti-shipping, close air support, and ground attack missions. They made their theatrical appearance in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and have featured in movies, television shows, and the Star Wars expanded universe's books, comics, and games. Origin and design Industrial Light & Magic's Colin Cantwell, who also designed the saga's TIE fighters, initially designed the Y-wing with a large bubble turret for a gunner. However, the dome did not appear properly when filmed against bluescreen and subsequent designs omitted the turret. Appearances In the original Star Wars movie (1977), a group of Y-wings designated \\"Gold Squadron\\" took part in the attack on the Death Star. Led by squadron leader Jon Vander (Angus MacInnes), Y-wings made the first unsuccessful \\"trench run\\" on the Death Star's exhaust port, and only one Y-wing would survive the battle itself. Y-wings made a brief appearance at the end of The Empire Strikes Back (1980) when the heroes are reunited with the Rebel fleet, and feature alongside other Rebel starfighters during the climatic space battle of Return of the Jedi (1983). Y-wings were later seen in The Clone Wars 2008 television series. Here they are depicted as fighter- bombers used by the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars against the Separatists. General Anakin Skywalker is shown leading a squadron of Y-wings on one of their first missions to take out a Separatist cruiser, where they are noted for their powerful shields and secondary gunner. In the Star Wars Rebels 2014 animated series, the crew of the Ghost are shown stealing Old Republic Y-wings, in the process of being dismantled by the Galactic Empire, for use by the nascent Rebel Alliance. Y-wings made their theatrical reappearance in Rogue One (2016), an anthology film set immediately prior to the events of the original Star Wars film. Here the Y-wings of Gold Squadron are shown playing a pivotal role during the Battle of Scarif in disabling an Imperial Star Destroyer with ion torpedoes. Y-wings would appear again during the climax of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Depiction Based on Star Wars background material, the Galactic Republic commissioned Koensayr Manufacturing to produce the BTL-B Y-wing during the early part of the Clone Wars. Prized for its durability and long-range striking capability, the success of the Y-wing prompted further production of the original model and a number of variants. However when the war concluded and the Galactic Empire came to power, Y-wings were decommissioned and relegated to military surplus sellers or scrapyards. The Rebel Alliance sought to buy or commandeer as many Y-wings as possible and they became the most readily available starfighters to the Rebellion during the Galactic Civil War. Rebel Y-wings were used to perform a variety of missions including courier, escort and reconnaissance. The original BTL-B Y-wing features a forward module seating a pilot in the cockpit and a gunner in a bubble turret. An astromech droid (which served as the fighter's navigation system) fits into a dedicated socket behind them. The module contains the starfighter's armaments: two forward-firing laser cannons, twin ion cannons in the turret, and a pair of torpedo launchers with six-round magazines capable of launching bombs, cluster missiles and other ordnance. The module connects to two powerful ion engines via reinforced central spar and cross wing, all encased in heavy armor plating. Variants include the BTL-S3, which replaces the bubble turret with a remote-controlled turret and seats the gunner behind the pilot in the cockpit, and the BTL-A4, which removes the gunner altogether and gives the pilot control of the ion cannons. Once acquired, Rebel technicians modified the fighter-bombers to make them more suitable to the Rebellion's hit-and-run tactics. Armor plating was removed to save on weight and make it easier to perform maintenance, compensated for by increasing deflector shield power. Various other components were removed or rearranged - such as replacing the six-round torpedo magazines with four-round versions - to lighten weight and increase performance while maintaining overall integrity. The resulting modification makes these Rebel Y-wings faster and more lethal than the original version. After the defeat of the Empire, Koensayr introduced a new version of the Y-wing to capitalize on the fighter's popularity. This BTA-NR2 model emulates the look of the Rebel-modified Y-wings both because the public is more familiar with this version and because it allows for greater customization. While outwardly mimicking the \\"classic\\" Y-wing design, the new version features various upgrades including stronger shields and more sophisticated sensors. Cultural impact In 2018, a number of Star Wars starfighters had their aerodynamic abilities tested using the Autodesk Flow Design virtual wind tunnel program. Of those tested, the Y-wing had a drag coefficient of .68 which, while worse than the real-life example of the F-4E Phantom with a rating of .02, was better than that of most TIE Fighters tested. These poor results were rationalized with the in-universe explanations that drag coefficient plays no role in space travel, and that Star Wars fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector shields to give themselves better flight profiles.

It made its theatrical debut, as the T-65B model, in Star Wars (1977) as the spacecraft piloted by Luke Skywalker and the Red Squadron when Luke destroyed the Death Star. The starfighter featured extensively in the Star Wars original trilogy and in the Expanded Universe that followed, and has been merchandised as a variety of toys and models. Starting with The Force Awakens (2015) a new model of X-wing was introduced which has gone on to play a prominent role in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The T-70 X-wing, flown by the Resistance in their fight against the First Order, is depicted as the successor to the T-65. Although described as being an improvement over the original, in the expanded literature this new X-wing is itself considered outdated, having been replaced by the T-85 X-wing in the New Republic's fleet. The T-85 X-wing made its first appearance in the TV series Star Wars Resistance (2018). Origin and design Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) Colin Cantwell sketched and built models that eventually became the final X-wing fighter in Star Wars. The X-wings were designed to appear more \\"traditional\\" than the Empire's TIE fighters. ILM built miniatures in various scales, with wing markings indicating which prop represented which pilot. When ILM fell behind on generating X-wing footage, Star Wars producer George Lucas and his editors temporarily used World War II dogfight footage for initial editing cuts. Each X-wing model was built around a hollow core made from surgical tubing, which allowed lighting, cooling, and electrical connectors for the wing motors to be installed and maintained. The cockpit windows were made from faceted glass so that accurate reflections could be filmed. Although the movie's initial script and novelization describe the X-wings as belonging to \\"Blue squadron\\", limitations in bluescreen photography led to the markings on the filming models, as well as the fictional squadron affiliation being changed to red. In addition to miniatures, special effects genius John Stears and his crew made a single, full-size X-wing for scenes in the Rebels' Yavin 4 base hangar; combined with cardboard cutouts and careful editing, the Rebels appear to have dozens of fighters. The production crew also made a full-size X-wing cockpit that was used for all actors; the astromech droid visible behind each actor was changed for each starfighter. Background noise pitch and tone also varied between X-wings to further differentiate the characters piloting them.Star Wars - Audio Commentary (2004). 1:49.05 - 1:05.00 The \\"lake\\" in which Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) crashes his X-wing in The Empire Strikes Back was only deep, requiring the creation of a rig resembling the starfighter sitting in the lake at an angle.Kershner, Irvin. The Empire Strikes Back - Audio Commentary (2004). 1:06.39-1:07.40 The rig was built in hinged sections so it could be manipulated by frogmen to sink or rise, a key feature for the scene when Luke fails to levitate his ship from the water. In 1993, ILM visual effects specialist John Knoll created a proof of concept test of dogfighting X-wings and TIE fighters to demonstrate the feasibility of using commercially available desktop computer software for simple animation work. This resulted in numerous parts of space battle scenes being \\"re-shot\\" as digital animations for the original trilogy's Special Edition releases. The ARC-170 starfighter seen in Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith is the ancestor of the X-wing and is deliberately reminiscent of the X-wing's design. Depiction X-wings with their s-foils locked in attack position as they assault the Death Star in Star Wars (1997 Special Edition). According to Star Wars canon, the T-65B X-wing was produced by the Incom Corporation, which had previously supplied the ARC-170 and Z-95 Headhunter starfighters to the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. When the Galactic Empire ordered them to produce a new starfighter for the Imperial Navy, Incom engineers took inspiration from their previous work to create the X-wing. Production was already underway however when politicking resulted in the Empire choosing instead to go with Sienar Fleet Systems' TIE fighter. Faced with an overproduction of expensive starfighters, a new market was found when agents of the Rebel Alliance contacted Incom about acquiring their stock of X-wings, to which Incom eagerly agreed. The X-wing quickly became a symbol of the Rebellion thanks to its use in several spectacular victories and the role it played in ultimately defeating the Empire. Compared to the TIE fighter, the X-wing is said to be slower and less maneuverable in space, but boasts superior firepower, defenses, atmospheric maneuverability, and a supraluminal hyperdrive. Its four laser canons can be fired singly, in pairs or all at once, and each launcher can carry up to three proton torpedoes. In addition to deflector shields, the X-wing possesses a titanium alloy armored hull, electronic countermeasures, and armored cockpit. An inertial dampener protects the pilot from high-g maneuvers, while an anti-gravity \\"repulsorlift\\" provides for flight in planetary atmospheres. The T-65B X-wing's distinctive strike foils or \\"S-foils\\" are opened and closed by powerful servo motors in the spacecraft. When in the open or 'attack' position, they provided a greater range of fire to the laser cannons mounted on the end of each wing. They also serve to distribute energy to enlarge the deflector shield, shed waste heat, and function as stabilizer surfaces during air travel. Instead of a dedicated navigational system, the X-wing makes use of an astromech droid (such as R2-D2) which fits in a socket behind the cockpit. The droid can hold up to 10 hyperspace coordinates, make minor repairs to the craft, and assume full control of the X-wing if needed. As with the pilot's ejection seat, an explosive charge can eject the droid from the X-wing in an emergency. =In Legends= According to roleplaying and other literature prior to Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilms, the origin of the X-wing is somewhat different compared to later material. Incom Corporation had already begun designing the X-wing when the Empire's Imperial Security Bureau began to suspect the company of Rebel sympathies. Before the empire could seize control of the company, the designers defected to the Rebel Alliance and handed over the X-wing's schematics. The Rebel Alliance adopted the military strategy of Doctrine of Space Denial, wherein the Rebellion would raid Imperial boneyards and shipping frigates, both to disrupt Imperial logistics and operations, and also to requisition desperately needed materials. X-wing hyperdrive capabilities allowed for this kind of harassment and escape before the Empire could react. The presence of a hyperdrive and deflector shields differentiate the X-wing from the Empire's TIE fighters, emphasizing the importance the Rebels place on pilots surviving their missions. Novels and roleplaying material set after Return of the Jedi showed the X-wing continued to be refined and upgraded in service to the New Republic; the \\"XJ\\"-series X-wings, depicted in the war against the Yuuzhan Vong, have a third proton torpedo launcher, stronger lasers and improved engines.  Merchandise and licensing  Kenner Toys produced an X-wing toy as a complement to its action figure line in 1978; this model was made from formed plastic and had a battery-operated light and buzzer in the forward fuselage. The \\"s-foils\\" were activated by depressing the molded astromech droid. In 1982, a \\"battle-damaged\\" version was released using the same mold but with damage stickers, a grey fuselage, blackened engine inlets, and a darker canopy. In countries outside the U.S., the electronics were removed and the R2-D2 ‚Äúbutton‚Äù was chrome (apart from the U.S., the electronic X-wing was only available in Brazil, Canada, and France). Kenner also produced a die-cast 1:72 miniature X-wing in 1978 and a smaller scaled version with \\"battle damage crash feature\\" for the short lived Micro Collection line in 1982. The X-wing appeared in four Micro Machines three-packs, including the first Star Wars pack released, a bronzed version, and a pack of three \\"battle damaged\\" X-wings with different colored markings. The Micro Machines X-wing has also been released in two single-packs, as a promotional souvenir with German video releases, in a nine-pack of Original Trilogy vehicles, and once in clear plastic. The X-wing appears eight times in the Micro Machines Action Fleet toy line: Luke's starfighter on its own, with \\"targeter\\" stand, with Dagobah swamp damage, and in a double pack with a TIE Fighter, Wedge's starfighter on its own, and as a component of the Yavin Rebel Base playset, a toy based on the prototype packaged with Biggs Darklighter's starfighter, and Jek Porkins' starfighter. Lego also released several X-wing models, including a 76-piece miniature X-wing/TIE advanced kit, a 263-piece X-wing (1999/2002), a 563-piece X-wing kit with Yoda's Hut (2004), a 437-piece X-Wing (2006), and a 560-piece X-wing (2012). A 1,304-piece \\"Ultimate Collector's\\" model was released in 2000. A new \\"Ultimate Collector's\\" model with 1,559 pieces was released in 2013. X-wings also appear in numerous Star Wars games and Expanded Universe stories. The player pilots an X-wing in the Atari Star Wars game. It is also a playable ship in numerous LucasArts games, and is the eponymous vessel in the first of several space combat simulator games. Both the Rebel Assault and Rebel Assault II rail shooters include X-wing levels, and X-wing squadrons are controllable units in the Rebellion and Empire at War strategy games. Decipher and Wizards of the Coast published X-wing and X-wing-related cards for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game and Star Wars Trading Card Game, respectively. Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston wrote the X-wing novel series that focuses on the X-wing pilots of Rogue Squadron and Wraith Squadron, the former expanding the story of pilots like Wedge Antilles who appear in the films. Dark Horse Comics has also published an X-Wing Rogue Squadron series. In 2012, Fantasy Flight Games released the Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game featuring several pilots and variations of the ship. The X-wing also included in its Star Wars: Armada miniatures game and Star Wars: Rebellion board game. Cultural influence A model of Luke Skywalker's X-wing was among 250 Star Wars-related items on display at the National Air and Space Museum celebrating the franchise's twentieth anniversary. An original X-wing filming prop sold at auction for $160,000 in July 2016. In 2007, the San Diego Tripoli Rocket Association built and launched a X-wing model propelled by four rockets, which exploded seconds after launch. A life- size X-wing is suspended from the ceiling at the Star Trader gift shop in Disneyland in California, as well as one displayed outdoors by the Star Tours attraction at Disneyland Paris. A life-size X-wing made from Lego blocks appeared in Times Square, and a ¬æ-size replica is on display at the Wings Over the Rockies Air & Space Museum in Denver. In 2018, a number of Star Wars starfighters had their aerodynamic abilities tested using the Autodesk Flow Design virtual wind tunnel program. When tested, the classic T-65 X-wing design had a drag coefficient of .45, which is only slightly better than the coefficient of a sphere. The newer T-70 X-wing flown by Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) was more aerodynamically sound with a rating of .24, but still fell short of the F-4E Phantom with its .02 drag coefficient. These poor results were rationalized with the in-universe explanations that drag coefficient plays no role in space travel, and that Star Wars fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector shields to give themselves better flight profiles.

Designed and manufactured by the Kuat Systems Engineering, they are depicted as fast but fragile interceptors of the Rebel Alliance, conceived for high- speed surgical strikes, deep reconnaissance and escort fighter duty. A-wings first appear in Return of the Jedi (1983) and later in numerous Star Wars materials and productions. It gained popularity through its depiction in several video games, and since 1985 the A-wing has been merchandised by several companies. They are the fastest vessels in the Star Wars canon, with the advantage of being the smallest hyperspace drive-equipped craft without relying on a carrier, allowing the vessel to extricate itself from a losing battle or escape hostile territory after performing an attack. Appearances RZ-1 A-wings from Green Squadron participate in the climactic Battle of Endor depicted in Return of the Jedi (1983). At Endor, an A-wing piloted by Arvel Crynyd (Hilton McRae) crashes into the bridge of the Super Star Destroyer Executor, resulting in the Executor crashing out of control into the second Death Star. In addition to McRae, two women recorded A-wing cockpit footage; one of the actors was cut, and the other was dubbed over by a male actor. A-wings later appear in various Star Wars Expanded Universe television shows, books, and games. Some Expanded Universe material says Jan Dodonna created the A-wing based on his analysis of the role of speed in the Battle of Yavin, the climactic battle in Star Wars (1977). Later material, such as the Star Wars Rebels television series, depicts the starfighters in use before the events of Star Wars. The A-wings of Phoenix Squadron play an important role in Rebels second season (2015‚Äì2016). Rebels producers used the A-wing in part because the ship was not used much in Return of the Jedi The fighter's presence in the cartoon was meant to show that different groups used different craft to fight the Empire. The series's episodes \\"The Holocrons of Fate\\" and \\"Twin Suns\\" also feature the two-seater RZ-1T trainer, a training spacecraft used by the rebels to train recruits. The RZ-1T also appears in the novel Battlefront II: Inferno Squad. A later variant, the RZ-2 A-wing, features in Star Wars Battlefront II and in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. It is a bigger spacecraft used by the Resistance against the First Order. Concept and design Ralph McQuarrie's concept art for the A-wing. Bluescreen limitations meant the blue parts of the craft were instead dark red on the production model. The A-wings in Star Wars Rebels use McQuarrie's original blue-and-white color scheme. The A-wing was one of two new Rebel Alliance starfighters created for Return of the Jedi. It was dubbed the A fighter because it was the first of the two designs created. Ralph McQuarrie's concept art has blue coloring, but these sections were red on the models because of bluescreen limitations. Wesley Seeds and Lorne Peterson of Industrial Light & Magic built the model, and its pilot figure is based on a World War I German airman. A battle-damaged engine \\"wing\\" was snapped into place to represent Arvel Crynyd's damaged fighter as it crashed into the Executor. McQuarrie's original blue-and-white coloring was used for the craft's appearance in Rebels. Photographs from the filming of Star Wars: The Last Jedi show an A-wing on the film set. Screen Rant suggests the A-wing seen in the photographs evokes some of McQuarrie's original design, such as the blaster cannon shape and the presence of additional ports in the cockpit.  Depiction  According to Star Wars canon, the A-wing was first produced by Kuat Systems Engineering, which had built the Delta-7 starfighter for the Jedi Order. With the Jedi eradicated (as depicted in Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith) and the Delta-7 nearly impossible for non-Jedi to pilot, Kuat designed a new starfighter, the R-22 A-wing, in hopes the Galactic Empire would purchase it. While impressed with prototypes of the R-22, the Empire instead went with the TIE fighter, and forbade Kuat from mass-producing the A-wing. The prototypes were sold to the kingdom of Tammuz-an, which over a decade later were eventually sold to the Rebel Alliance. Rebel engineers made many alterations to the original R-22 design to produce the RZ-1 model as seen in Return of the Jedi. The original engines were swapped out for more powerful ones, while other major components were replaced with lightweight versions so a supraluminal hyperdrive could be added. The resulting fighter is faster than even the Empire's TIE interceptor and perfect for hit-and-run attacks, long- range patrols, and reconnaissance missions. Its two laser cannons, mounted on special swivel mounts, can elevate or depress 60¬∞ vertically; some were modified for full 360¬∞ rotation but these had a greater chance to jam. However, engineers could not fit the A-wing with an astromech droid, which limited how many hyperspace coordinates it could carry. The lack of droid assistance also makes it challenging even for a being with Jedi-like reflexes to control a fighter so fast and maneuverable. Consequently, only the best Rebel pilots are allowed to fly the A-wing. After the Empire was defeated, background material explains how Kuat Systems Engineering made a number improvements to the design to create the RZ-2 A-wing for the New Republic Defense Fleet. Even faster than the original, the RZ-2 requires less maintenance than the RZ-1, and the swivel mounts that allow its laser cannons to rotate 360¬∞ were no longer at risk of jamming. Thanks to the New Republic's disarmament campaign, RZ-2s found their way into the Resistance, which like the Rebellion before allows only the best pilots to fly the A-wing.  Impact  CinemaBlend said the A-wing received little attention after Return of the Jedi because no prominent characters pilot the craft. Kenner in 1985 released an A-wing pilot figure as part of its Power of the Force line, and it released a \\"magnificent\\" A-wing toy as part of the Star Wars: Droids line. Since then, the A-wing has been recreated as various other toys, models, and collectibles by companies that include Galoob, Hasbro, Model Products Corporation, Estes Industries, Lego, and Fantasy Flight Games. Screen Rant said the A-wing gained popularity as a playable craft in the Star Wars: X-Wing space combat simulator (1993), which The Escapist said depicted the ship as \\"an excellent dogfighter\\". Subsequent video games that allowed players to pilot the A-wing also contributed to the ship's popularity. Blastr ranked the A-wing 16th on its list of the best Star Wars vehicles. Prince Harry was photographed sitting in an A-wing cockpit during his and the Duke of Cambridge's April 2016 visit to the Star Wars: Episode VIII set. Responding to the photographs, various publications called the A-wing \\"iconic\\", an \\"unsung hero\\", \\"woefully underappreciated\\", and \\"a classic\\". In 2018 a number of Star Wars starfighters - including the A-wing - had their aerodynamic abilities tested using the Autodesk Flow Design virtual wind tunnel program. Of those starfighters tested the A-wing was among the most aerodynamic designs of all with a drag coefficient of .17, though it was still worse than the real-life example of the F-4E Phantom with a .02 rating. These poor results were rationalized with the in-universe explanations that drag coefficient plays no role in space travel, and that Star Wars fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector shields to give themselves better flight profiles.

Definitions of victimless crimes vary in different parts of the world and different law systems, but usually include possession of any illegal contraband, recreational drug use, prostitution and prohibited sexual behavior between consenting adults, assisted suicide, and smuggling among other similar infractions. However, there is controversy surrounding this. Edwin Schur and Hugo Adam Bedau state in their book Victimless Crimes: Two Sides of a Controversy that \\"some of these laws produce secondary crime, and all create new 'criminals,' many of whom are otherwise law-abiding citizens and people in authority.\\" In politics, a lobbyist or an activist might use this phrase with the implication that the law in question should be abolished. Victimless crimes are, in the harm principle of John Stuart Mill, \\"victimless\\" from a position that considers the individual as the sole sovereign, to the exclusion of more abstract bodies such as a community or a state against which criminal offenses may be directed.\\"The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\"  Definition  Three characteristics can be used to identify whether a crime is a victimless crime ‚Äì if the act is excessive, is indicative of a distinct pattern of behavior, and its adverse effects impact only the person who has engaged in it ‚Äì according to the University of Chicago's vice scholar, Jim Leitzel.Hughes, B. T. (2015). Strictly Taboo: Cultural Anthropology's Insights into Mass Incarceration and Victimless Crime. New England Journal On Criminal & Civil Confinement, 41(1), 49‚Äì84. In theory, each polity determines for itself the laws it wants to have, so as to maximize the happiness of its citizens. As knowledge progresses and behavior changes, and values change as well, laws in most countries lag badly behind social changes. Once it is obvious to a vast majority that the law is unnecessary at best, the law, until it is repealed, will be prohibiting a victimless crime. Many victimless crimes begin because of a desire to obtain illegal products or services that are in high demand. Criminal penalties thus tend to limit the supply more than the demand, driving up the black-market price and creating monopoly profits for those criminals who remain in business. This \\"crime tariff\\" encourages the growth of sophisticated and well-organized criminal groups. Organized crime in turn tends to diversify into other areas of crime. Large profits provide ample funds for bribery of public officials, as well as capital for diversification. The War on Drugs is a commonly cited example of prosecution of victimless crime. The reasoning behind this is that drug use does not directly harm other people. It is argued that the criminalization of drugs leads to highly inflated prices for drugs. For example, Bedau and Schur found in 1974 that \\"In England the pharmacy cost of heroin [was] 0.06 cents per grain. In the United States street price [was] $30‚Äì90 per grain.\\" This inflation in price is believed to drive addicts to commit crimes such as theft and robbery, which are thought to be inherently damaging to society, in order to be able to purchase the drugs on which they are dependent. In addition to the creation of a black market for drugs, the War on Drugs is argued by proponents of legalization to reduce the workforce by damaging the ability of those convicted to find work. It is reasoned that this reduction of the workforce is ultimately harmful to an economy reliant on labor. The number of drug arrests increases every year. In a poll taken by the Bureau of Justice Statistics between 1980 and 2009, \\"[over a] 30-year period...[arrest] rates for drug possession or use doubled for whites and tripled for blacks.\\" Legalization of victimless acts Many activities that were once considered crimes are no longer illegal in some countries, at least in part because of their status as victimless crimes. Two large categories of victimless crimes are sexual pleasure and recreational drug use (drug pleasure). On the first, *Homosexuality was legalized in Russia after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, led by Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Legalization occurred when the Bolsheviks decriminalized consensual sodomy by omitting it from their list of illegal sexual acts in the 1922 Bolshevik legal code, likely because they wanted to simplify their dealings with sexual crime. Joseph Stalin later persecuted the existence of homosexuality under his regime by undermining Bolshevik law, though the exact extent of his ruthlessness and policing of those with same-sex attraction is unclear. *In the UK in the 1950s, the Wolfenden report recommended the legalization of \\"homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private\\", for these reasons. *Almost fifty years later, Lawrence v. Texas struck down U.S. sodomy laws. As of 2018, sale of sex toys remains illegal in Alabama. Marijuana use is forbidden by law in Australia but is the most ‚Äúwidely used illicit drug‚Äù in the country, just as it is in countries such as the United States and New Zealand. Prohibition of alcohol in the United States, repealed in 1933, is considered a failed \\"social experiment\\" because many citizens ignored what it stipulated, turning to home- made spirits in lieu of licensed alcoholic drinks and resultantly making problems worse. In the United States today, tension over marijuana legalization is in response to the current marijuana prohibition in most states, but there are efforts to legalize cannabis in many countries such as the United States and Australia, as its legalization has the potential to greatly increase revenue. Prostitution is legal in many countries, though usually restricted. The Netherlands legalized prostitution in 1999, and was one of the first countries to do so. As of 2012, however, it has been considering policy changes to severely restrict it. Adultery (sexual acts between a married person and a person other than the spouse) and fornication (sexual acts between unmarried people) have not been prosecuted in the United States for over 50 years, although the laws against them, like those against sodomy, are still on the books in several states. However, because sodomy laws were struck down as unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas, the laws against fornication would also be unconstitutional as was recognized by the Supreme Court of Virginia in Martin v. Ziherl. Controversy The degradation of societal moral standards is a major concern among those who oppose the legalization of victimless crime. However, punishing citizens solely for their choice to engage in victimless acts declared by the law to be immoral is difficult. While the United States' typical response to crimes is retroactive, the illegality of victimless crimes is a more preventative approach to justice and is highly controversial. Controversies over victimless crime deal mostly with the question of whether a crime can ever actually be victimless. With relation to drugs and their pathway to consumption, the impact of the drug trade and liability laws on drug dealers, their families, and other unforeseen actors may end in victimization. The possession of both adult and child pornography is also often considered to be a victimless crime, but the victimization of adults and children during its production is typically unacknowledged by those who hold that position. In contrast, the argument that legal powers must be restrained to allow citizen autonomy, free from impediments in making voluntary, victimless choices that may or may not be perceived as morally wrong, also exists. With the incorporation of preventative law, such as sex offender registries and anti-social behavior orders, comes a loss of distinction between criminal and civil law because victimless crime is typically difficult to categorize and criminalize. This is problematic because it causes a distortion of traditional procedures found within the criminal and civil of aspects of United States law by enabling confusion and procedural interchangeability.

See mcwilliams.com. Criminology Liberalism Libertarian theory Political terminology Crime ","title":"Victimless crime"},{"id":"50804","text":"A consensual crime is a public-order crime that involves more than one participant, all of whom give their consent as willing participants in an activity that is unlawful. Legislative bodies and interest groups sometimes rationalize the criminalization of consensual activity because they feel it offends cultural norms, or because one of the parties to the activity is considered a \\"victim\\" despite their informed consent.Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate, 2011), chapter 5. Consensual crimes can be described as crimes in which the victim is the state, the judicial system, or society at large and so affect the general (sometimes ideological or cultural) interests of the system, such as common sexual morality. Victimless crimes, while similar, typically involve acts that do not involve multiple persons. Drug use is typically considered a victimless crime whereas the sale of drugs between two or more persons would be a consensual crime. The fact that no persons come forward to claim injury has essentially made the two terms interchangeable in common use.  Giving consent  When discussing consensual crime, one issue is whether all the participants are capable of giving genuine legal consent. This may not be the case if one or more of the participants are: * Animals * Children (normally measured as being under the legal age of consent) * Severely disabled * Severely mentally ill * Not fully informed about the issues involved * Suffering from mood swings * Acting under duress * Addicted * Intoxicated * Unconscious  Examples  The generally accepted definition of a consensual crime is a criminal act committed by two or more people, who consent to involvement, and does not involve any nonconsenting individuals. The following is a list of criminal acts in various societies at various times and in different societies, where the issue of liability hinges on consent or the lack of it: * Unlicensed prize fights and other criminal activities of a sporting nature where the players consent and the audience actively approves of what they see (in English law, see R v Coney). * Murder or incitement to murder where one person actively solicits others to terminate their life, or the life of another. For example, a driver may be trapped in a burning tanker full of gasoline and beg a passing armed police officer to shoot him rather than let him burn to death. These situations are distinguishable from soliciting the cessation of life-sustaining treatment so that the injured person may die a natural death, or leaving instructions not to resuscitate in the event of death. Note that, in English law under the Suicide Act 1961, suicide is not a crime committed by a person who fails to die. Thus, those who assist in a suicide attempt would-be participants in a victimless crime because the would-be suicide cannot be tried. If the suicide succeeds, the legal issue is whether the assistants actively facilitated the death, or as doctors, nurses or carers, omitted to prevent natural death in circumstances where society believes they have no legal duty to take that preventive action. Some countries have characterised some of the possible situations as assisted suicide, while others make no judgment by imposing a separate label on conduct within the field of homicide. The issues may more generally relate to euthanasia where society debates whether, and in what circumstances, to terminate the lives of its citizens. Whichever philosophical route is followed, the laws will either criminalize any situation in which death results or permit death to be caused under controlled circumstances. * Sexual and non-sexual assaults involving the use or threatened use of violence which causes injuries and which would be criminal in all other situations (e.g. sadism and masochism). In more extreme cases of edgeplay where a rape fantasy may be enacted by prior agreement, the offence of rape will not be committed because the \\"victim\\" has actually consented to sexual intercourse. The issue of consent in fact, or belief in the existence of consent, is fundamental to determining whether a rape has, or has not, been committed. In English law, for example, s74 Sexual Offences Act 2003 provides that consent is present \\"if he agrees by choice, and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice\\". If the \\"victim\\" is unconscious when penetration occurs, he would not be consenting, but this might not be rape if there is a subsisting sexual relationship, e.g. the couple are married, and the other might reasonably believe that consent to intercourse existed by virtue of that relationship. Note that, if the \\"victim\\" is physically injured, the causing of those injuries can still be charged as an assault whether there is actual consent or not. As a defence, offenders may plead that the other consented to the acts, and argue that any injuries sustained were accidental rather than intentional, leaving it to the jury to make a decision on their truthfulness.  See more fully the discussion in Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate, 2011 ) where Dr Baker argues (in chapter 5) that there is a limit to consensual harm doing‚Äîbut that the threshold of harm has to be reasonably high. Baker also asserts that it is only the harm-doer who should be criminalized; not the harm-receiver. He also points out there is a difference between risking harm to others (as those who engage in casual sex do when they know that there is a chance they might have HIV, and deliberately exposing another to the risk of HIV, for example, where a person has been told he or she is a carrier and fails to inform his or her sexual partner. * Pornography, which can be illegal to produce, distribute or possess in some countries, even if the participants consented to the acts, and the acts themselves are legal (see: List of pornography laws by country). * Censorship laws, such as obscenity laws, may criminalise distribution of material even if it is only viewed by those who consent to viewing it. * Statutory rape where the underage participant(s) give actual consent, but the law-makers of the relevant jurisdiction have determined that people of that age are not legally capable of giving informed consent (not informed adequately about the activity). * The criminal transmission of HIV by consensual sexual activity infects one partner with a terminal disease which is, if not a homicide in the long term, certainly a serious injury constituting an assault in the short term. This is a complex issue because if two people, knowing the risk of transmission, voluntarily agree not to use a condom, they are consenting to an activity that risks the transmission of any sexually transmitted disease. But if one partner is aware of being HIV positive, the other partner should expect a warning or if not, at least a truthful answer to the question, so they can give informed consent. Law-makers have a policy decision to make as to whether that informed consent can excuse criminal liability. * Adultery and, in general, sex outside marriage or other established relationships where all persons immediately involved give consent. The issue in each of these situations is the same. Society has created a formal framework of laws to prohibit types of conduct thought to be against the public interest. Laws proscribing homicide, assaults and rape are common to most cultures. Thus, when the supposed victim freely consents to be the victim in one of these crimes, the question is whether the state should make an exception from the law for this one situation. Take euthanasia as an example. If one person intentionally takes the life of another, this is usually murder. If the motive for this is to collect the inheritance, society has no difficulty in ignoring the motive and convicting the killer. But if the motive is to relieve the suffering of the victim by providing a clean death that would otherwise be denied, can society so quickly reject the motive? It is a case of balancing the harms. On the one hand, society could impose pain and suffering on the victim by forcing him or her to endure a long decline into death. Or society could permit a system for terminating life under controlled circumstances so that the victim's wishes could be respected without exposing others to the criminal system for assisting in realising those wishes. The other situations move down the hierarchy of non-fatal and sexual assaults with society deciding whether, and in what circumstances, to offer an excuse or exculpation to those who freely participate.

Prime Minister Edmund Barton was a member of the Association. The badge shows the use of the slogan \\"White Australia\\" at that time.See Museum Victoria description The term White Australia policy is widely used to encapsulate a set of historical policies that aimed to forbid people of non-European ethnic origin, especially Asians (primarily Chinese) and Pacific Islanders from immigrating to Australia, starting in 1901. Governments progressively dismantled such policies between 1949 and 1973. Competition in the gold fields between British and Chinese miners, and labour- union opposition to the importation of Pacific Islanders (primarily South Sea Islanders) into the sugar plantations of Queensland, reinforced demands to eliminate or minimise low-wage immigration from Asia and the Pacific Islands. From the 1850s colonial governments imposed restrictions on family members joining Chinese miners already in Australia. The colonial authorities levied a special tax on Chinese immigrants and from which other immigrants were exempted. Towards the end of the 19th century labour unions pushed to stop Chinese immigrants working in the furniture and market garden industries. Australian furniture had to be labelled \\"Made with Chinese Labour\\". Soon after Australia became a federation in January 1901, the federal government of Edmund Barton passed the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901, drafted by the man who would become Australia's second Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin. The passage of this bill marked the commencement of the White Australia Policy as Australian federal government policy. Subsequent acts further strengthened the policy up to the start of the Second World War. These policies effectively gave British migrants preference over all others through the first four decades of the 20th century. During the Second World War, Prime Minister John Curtin reinforced the policy, saying \\"This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race.\\" Successive governments dismantled the policy in stages after the conclusion of the Second World War, with the encouragement of first non-British, non-white immigration, allowing for a large multi-ethnic post-war program of immigration. The Menzies and Holt Governments (1949‚Äì1967) effectively dismantled the policies between 1949 and 1966, and the Whitlam Government passed laws to ensure that race would be totally disregarded as a component for immigration to Australia in 1973. In 1975 the Whitlam Government passed the Racial Discrimination Act, which made racially-based selection criteria unlawful. In the decades since, Australia has maintained large-scale multi-ethnic immigration. , Australia's migration program allows people from any country to apply to migrate to Australia, regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, culture, religion, or language, provided that they meet the criteria set out in law. Immigration policy in Federation =Gold Rush Era= It effectively stopped all non- European immigration into the country and that contributed to the development of a racially insulated white society. The discovery of gold in Australia in 1851 led to an influx of immigrants from all around the world. The colony of New South Wales had a population of just 200,000 in 1851, but the huge influx of settlers spurred by the gold rushes transformed the Australian colonies economically, politically and demographically. Over the next 20 years, 40,000 Chinese men and over 9,000 women (mostly Cantonese) immigrated to the goldfields seeking prosperity. Gold brought great wealth but also new social tensions. Multi-ethnic migrants came to New South Wales in large numbers for the first time. Competition on the goldfields, particularly resentment among white miners towards the successes of Chinese miners, led to tensions between groups and eventually a series of significant protests and riots, including the Buckland riot in 1857 and the Lambing Flat riots between 1860 and 1861. Governor Hotham, on 16 November 1854, appointed a Royal Commission on Victorian goldfields problems and grievances. This led to restrictions being placed on Chinese immigration and residency taxes levied from Chinese residents in Victoria from 1855 with New South Wales following suit in 1861. These restrictions remained in force until the early 1870s.R. Lockwood, \\"British Imperial Influences in the Foundation of the White Australia Policy,\\" Labour History, No. 7 (Nov. 1964), pp. 23‚Äì33 in JSTORReference does not support the argument of this paragraph = Support from the Australian Labour Movement = Melbourne Trades Hall was opened in 1859 with Trades and Labour Councils and Trades Halls opening in all cities and most regional towns in the following forty years. During the 1880s Trade unions developed among shearers, miners, and stevedores (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all blue-collar jobs. Shortages of labour led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an eight-hour day and other benefits unheard of in Europe. Eight-hour day march circa 1900, outside Parliament House in Spring Street, Melbourne. Australia gained a reputation as \\"the working man's paradise.\\" Some employers tried to undercut the unions by importing Chinese labour. This produced a reaction which led to all the colonies restricting Chinese and other Asian immigration. This was the foundation of the White Australia Policy. The \\"Australian compact\\", based around centralised industrial arbitration, a degree of government assistance particularly for primary industries, and White Australia, was to continue for many years before gradually dissolving in the second half of the 20th century. The growth of the sugar industry in Queensland in the 1870s led to searching for labourers prepared to work in a tropical environment. During this time, thousands of \\"Kanakas\\" (Pacific Islanders) were brought into Australia as indentured workers. This and related practices of bringing in non-white labour to be cheaply employed was commonly termed \\"blackbirding\\" and refers to the recruitment of people through trickery and kidnappings to work on plantations, particularly the sugar cane plantations of Queensland (Australia) and Fiji. In the 1870s and 1880s, the trade union movement began a series of protests against foreign labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for \\"substandard\\" wages, lowered working conditions and refused unionisation. Objections to these arguments came largely from wealthy land owners in rural areas. It was argued that without Asiatics to work in the tropical areas of the Northern Territory and Queensland, the area would have to be abandoned. Despite these objections to restricting immigration, between 1875 and 1888 all Australian colonies enacted legislation which excluded all further Chinese immigration. Asian immigrants already residing in the Australian colonies were not expelled and retained the same rights as their Anglo and Southern compatriots. Agreements were made to further increase these restrictions in 1895 following an Inter-colonial Premier's Conference where all colonies agreed to extend entry restrictions to all non-white races. However, in attempting to enact this legislation, the Governors of New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania reserved the bills, due to a treaty with Japan, and they did not become law. Instead, the Natal Act of 1897 was introduced, restricting \\"undesirable persons\\" rather than any specific race. The British government in London was not pleased with legislation that discriminated against certain subjects of its Empire, but decided not to disallow the laws that were passed. Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain explained in 1897: > We quite sympathise with the determination...of these colonies...that there > should not be an influx of people alien in civilisation, alien in religion, > alien in customs, whose influx, moreover, would seriously interfere with the > legitimate rights of the existing labouring population.Speech to Colonial > Conference of 1897, quoted in J. Holland Rose et al., eds. The Cambridge > History of the British Empire: Volume VII: Part I: Australia (1933) p 411; > full text From Federation to the Second World War In writing about the preoccupations of the Australian population in early Federation Australia before the First World War in ANZAC to Amiens, the official historian of the war, Charles Bean, considered the White Australia policy and defined it as follows: > \\"White Australia Policy\\" ‚Äì a vehement effort to maintain a high Western > standard of economy, society and culture (necessitating at that stage, > however it might be camouflaged, the rigid exclusion of Oriental peoples). =Federation Convention and Australia's first government= Immigration was a prominent topic in the lead up to Australian Federation. At the third Session of the Australasian Federation Convention of 1898, Western Australian premier and future federal cabinet member John Forrest summarised the prevailing feeling: The Barton Government which came to power following the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the Protectionist Party with the support of the Australian Labor Party. The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the Australian Workers Union and other labour organisations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded. The first Parliament of Australia quickly moved to restrict immigration to maintain Australia's British character, and the Pacific Island Labourers Bill and the Immigration Restriction Bill were passed shortly before parliament rose for its first Christmas recess. The Colonial Secretary in Britain had however made it clear that a race-based immigration policy would run \\"contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have ever been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the Empire\\". The Barton Government therefore conceived of the \\"language dictation test\\", which would allow the government, at the discretion of the minister, to block unwanted migrants by forcing them to sit a test in \\"any European language\\". Race had already been established as a premise for exclusion among the colonial parliaments, so the main question for debate was who exactly the new Commonwealth ought to exclude, with the Labor Party rejecting Britain's calls to placate the populations of its non-white colonies and allow \\"aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the islands thereof\\". There was opposition from Queensland and its sugar industry to the proposals of the Pacific Islanders Bill to exclude \\"Kanaka\\" laborers, however Barton argued that the practice was \\"veiled slavery\\" that could lead to a \\"negro problem\\" similar to that in the United States, and the Bill was passed.Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978 Immigration Restriction Act 1901 The new Federal Parliament, as one of its first pieces of legislation, passed the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 (1 Edward VII 17 1901) to \\"place certain restrictions on immigration and... for the removal... of prohibited immigrants\\". The Act drew on similar legislation in South Africa. Edmund Barton, the prime minister, argued in support of the Bill with the following statement: \\"The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishman and the Chinaman.\\" The Attorney General tasked with drafting the legislation was Alfred Deakin. Deakin supported Barton's position over that of the Labor Party in drafting the Bill (the ALP wanted more direct methods of exclusion than the dictation test) and redacted the more vicious racism proposed for the text in his Second Reading of the Bill. In seeking to justify the policy, Deakin said he believed that the Japanese and Chinese might be a threat to the newly formed federation and it was this belief that led to legislation to ensure they would be kept out: > It is not the bad qualities, but the good qualities of these alien races > that make them so dangerous to us. It is their inexhaustible energy, their > power of applying themselves to new tasks, their endurance and low standard > of living that make them such competitors. Early drafts of the Act explicitly banned non-Europeans from migrating to Australia but objections from the British government, which feared that such a measure would offend British subjects in India and Britain's allies in Japan, caused the Barton government to remove this wording. Instead, a \\"dictation test\\" was introduced as a device for excluding unwanted immigrants. Immigration officials were given the power to exclude any person who failed to pass a 50-word dictation test. At first this was to be in any European language, but was later changed to include any language. The tests were written in such a way to make them nearly impossible to pass. The first of these tests was written by Federal MP Stewart Parnaby as an example for officers to follow when setting future tests. The \\"Stewart\\" test was unofficially standardised as the English version of the test, due to its extremely high rates of failure resulting from a very sophisticated use of language.Stuart MacIntyre (1986) The Oxford History of Australia, Volume 4 1901‚Äì1942 Oxford University Press, Melbourne. While specifically asked by Barton to carry out this task, Parnaby allegedly shared similar views to Donald Cameron despite never publicly admitting so. The legislation found strong support in the new Australian Parliament, with arguments ranging from economic protection to outright racism. The Labor Party wanted to protect \\"white\\" jobs and pushed for more explicit restrictions. A few politicians spoke of the need to avoid hysterical treatment of the question. Member of Parliament Bruce Smith said he had \\"no desire to see low-class Indians, Chinamen or Japanese...swarming into this country... But there is obligation...not (to) unnecessarily offend the educated classes of those nations\\"Bruce Smith (Free Trade Party) Parliamentary Debates cited in D.M. Gibb (1973) The Making of White Australia.p.113. Victorian Historical Association. ISBN Donald Cameron, a Free Trade Party member from Tasmania, expressed a rare note of dissension: Outside parliament, Australia's first Catholic cardinal, Patrick Francis Moran was politically active and denounced anti-Chinese legislation as \\"unChristian\\". The popular press mocked the cardinal's position and the small European population of Australia generally supported the legislation and remained fearful of being overwhelmed by an influx of non-British migrants from the vastly different cultures of the highly populated empires to Australia's north. The Immigration Restriction Act 1901 imposed a dictation test, in any prescribed language, for any non- European migrant to Australia. Further discriminatory legislation was the Postal and Telegraph Services Act 1901 (1 Edward VII 12 1901), which required any ship carrying mail to and from Australia to only have a white crew. Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 In 1901 there were approximately 9,800 Pacific islander labourers in Queensland. In 1901 the Australian parliament passed the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 (1 Edward VII 16 1901). The result of these statutes was that 7,500 Pacific Islanders (called \\"Kanakas\\") working mostly on plantations in Queensland were deported, and entry into Australia by Pacific Islanders was prohibited after 1904. Those exempted from repatriation, along with a number of others who escaped deportation, remained in Australia to form the basis of what is today Australia's largest non-indigenous black ethnic group. Today, the descendants of those who remained are officially referred to as South Sea Islanders.Tracey Flanagan, Meredith Wilkie, and Susanna Iuliano. \\"Australian South Sea Islanders: A Century of Race Discrimination under Australian Law\\", Australian Human Rights Commission. Exemption for MƒÅori MƒÅori generally benefited from the same immigration and voting rights as European New Zealanders in Australia, making them a notable exception to the White Australia policy. In 1902, with the Commonwealth Franchise Act, MƒÅori residents in Australia were granted the right to vote, a right denied to Indigenous Australians. During that same period, their right to settle in Australia was facilitated by their shared status as British subjects. The Australian government granted equal rights to MƒÅori only reluctantly. In 1905, the New Zealand government made a formal complaint about the exclusion of two MƒÅori shearers, after which the Australian government changed its customs regulations to allow MƒÅori to freely enter the country. Other Pacific Islanders were still subject to the White Australia policy. =Paris Peace Conference= 1917 conscription referendum. The \\"No\\" campaign claimed that conscripted soldiers sent overseas would be replaced by non-white labour. At the 1919 Paris Peace Conference following the First World War, Japan sought to include a racial equality clause in the Covenant of the League of Nations. Japanese policy reflected their desire to remove or to ease the immigration restrictions against Japanese (especially in the United States and Canada), which Japan regarded as a humiliation and affront to its prestige. Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes was already concerned by the prospect of Japanese expansion in the Pacific. Australia, Japan and New Zealand had seized the German colonial empire's territories in the Pacific in the early stages of the war and Hughes was concerned to retain German New Guinea as vital to the defence of Australia. The Treaty ultimately granted Australia a League of Nations Mandate over German New Guinea and Japan to the South Seas Mandate immediately to its north ‚Äì thus bringing Australian and Japanese territory to a shared border ‚Äì a situation altered only by Japan's Second World War invasion of New Guinea. Hughes vehemently opposed Japan's racial equality proposition. Hughes recognised that such a clause would be a threat to White Australia and made it clear to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George that he would leave the conference if the clause was adopted. When the proposal failed, Hughes reported in the Australian parliament: > The White Australia is yours. You may do with it what you please, but at any > rate, the soldiers have achieved the victory and my colleagues and I have > brought that great principle back to you from the conference, as safe as it > was on the day when it was first adopted. =Alfred Deakin= Australian Prime Minister Alfred Deakin campaigned vehemently for the White Australia policy and made it a key issue in his 1903 Election speechAlfred Deakins 1903 Election Speech, http://electionspeeches.moadoph.gov.au/speeches/1903-alfred-deakin he proclaimed that the policy was not only for the preservation of the 'complexion' of Australia but it was for the establishment of 'social justice'. =Stanley Bruce= Australian Prime Minister Stanley Bruce was a supporter of the White Australia policy and made it an issue in his campaign for the 1925 Australian Federal election. > It is necessary that we should determine what are the ideals towards which > every Australian would desire to strive. I think those ideals might well be > stated as being to secure our national safety, and to ensure the maintenance > of our White Australia Policy to continue as an integral portion of the > British Empire. We intend to keep this country white and not allow its > people to be faced with the problems that at present are practically > insoluble in many parts of the world. Abolition of the policy =Second World War= Australian anxiety at the prospect of Japanese expansionism and war in the Pacific continued through the 1930s. Billy Hughes, by then a minister in the United Australia Party's Lyons Government, made a notable contribution to Australia's attitude towards immigration in a 1935 speech in which he argued that \\"Australia must... populate or perish\\". However Hughes was forced to resign in 1935 after his book Australia and the War Today exposed a lack of preparation in Australia for what Hughes correctly supposed to be a coming war. Between the Great Depression starting in 1929 and the end of the Second World War in 1945, global conditions kept immigration to very low levels. At the start of the war, Prime Minister John Curtin (ALP) reinforced the message of the White Australia policy by saying: \\"This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race.\\" Following the 1942 Fall of Singapore, Australians feared invasion by Imperial Japan. Australian cities were bombed by the Japanese Airforce and Navy and Axis Naval Forces menaced Australian shipping, while the Royal Navy remained pre-occupied with the battles of the Atlantic and Mediterranean in the face of Nazi aggression in Europe. A Japanese invasion fleet headed for the Australian Territory of New Guinea was only halted by the intervention of the United States Navy in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Australia received thousands of refugees from territories falling to advancing Japanese forces ‚Äì notably thousands of Dutch who fled the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). Australian Aborigines, Torres Strait Islanders, Papua New Guineans and Timorese served in the frontline of the defence of Australia, bringing Australia's racially discriminatory immigration and political rights policies into focus and wartime service gave many Indigenous Australians confidence in demanding their rights upon return to civilian life. During the war, talk arose about the possibility of abolishing the policy. Spokesman for the Labor Party demanded that it be continued: > The policy of White Australia is now, perhaps, the most outstanding > political characteristic of this country, and it has been accepted not only > by those closely associated with it, but also by those who watched and > studied \\"this interesting experiment\\" from afar. Only those who favor the > exploitation of a servile coloured race for greed of gain, and a few > professional economists and benighted theologians, are now heard in serious > criticism of a White Australia; but...they are encouraged by the ill-timed > and inappropriate pronouncements of what are, after all, irresponsible > officials.editorial in Australian Worker [Sydney] 15 March 1944, in F. K. > Crowley, Modern Australia in Documents: 1939‚Äì1970 (1973) 2:97‚Äì98. =Post-war immigration= Dutch migrants arriving in Australia in 1954. Australia embarked upon a massive immigration programme following the Second World War and gradually dismantled the preferential treatment afforded to British migrants. Following the trauma of Second World War, Australia's vulnerability during the Pacific War and its relatively small population compared to other nations led to policies summarised by the slogan, \\"populate or perish\\". According to author Lachlan Strahan, this was an ethnocentric slogan that in effect was an admonition to fill Australia with Europeans or else risk having it overrun by Asians.Lachlan Strahan, Australia's China: changing perceptions from the 1930s to the 1990s (1996) p. 146 Immigration Minister Arthur Calwell stated in 1947 to critics of the government's mass immigration programme: \\"We have 25 years at most to populate this country before the yellow races are down on us.\\" During the war, many non-white refugees, including Malays, Indonesians and Filipinos, arrived in Australia, but Calwell controversially sought to have them all deported. The Chifley Government introduced the Aliens Deportation Act 1948, which had its weaknesses exposed by the High Court case O'Keefe v Calwell, and then passed the War-time Refugees Removal Act 1949 which gave the immigration minister sweeping powers of deportation.Gone with hardly a trace: deportees in immigration policy, pp. 12‚Äì13. In 1948, Iranian Bah√° º√≠s seeking to immigrate to Australia were classified as \\"Asiatic\\" by the policy and were denied entry. In 1949, Calwell's successor Harold Holt allowed the remaining 800 non-white refugees to apply for residency, and also allowed Japanese \\"war brides\\" to settle in Australia. In the meantime, encouraging immigration from Europe, Australia admitted large numbers of immigrants from mostly Italy, Greece and Yugoslavia, as well as its traditional source of the British Isles. Ambitious post-war development projects like the Snowy Mountains Scheme (1949‚Äì1972) required a large labour force that could only be sourced by diversifying Australia's migrant intake. =Relaxation of restrictions= Sir Robert Menzies. The Menzies Government abolished the dictation test in 1958. Australian policy began to shift towards significantly increasing immigration. Legislative changes over the next few decades continuously opened up immigration in Australia. Labor Party Chifley Government: * 1947 The Chifley Labor Government relaxed the Immigration Restriction Act allowing non- Europeans the right to settle permanently in Australia for business reasons. Liberal-Country Party Menzies Government (1949‚Äì1966): *1949 Immigration Minister Harold Holt permitted 800 non-European refugees to stay, and Japanese war brides to be admitted. * 1950 External Affairs Minister Percy Spender instigated the Colombo Plan, under which students from Asian countries were admitted to study at Australian universities. * 1957 Non-Europeans with 15 years' residence in Australia were allowed to become citizens. * 1958 Migration Act 1958 abolished the dictation test and introduced a simpler system for entry. Immigration Minister, Sir Alick Downer, announced that 'distinguished and highly qualified Asians' might immigrate. * 1959 Australians were permitted to sponsor Asian spouses for citizenship. * 1964 Conditions of entry for people of non-European stock were relaxed. This was despite comments Menzies made in a discussion with radio 2UE's Stewart Lamb in 1955, where he appeared to be a defender of the White Australia Policy. > (Menzies) \\"I don't want to see reproduced in Australia the kind of problem > they have in South Africa or in America or increasingly in Great Britain. I > think it's been a very good policy and it's been of great value to us and > most of the criticism of it that I've ever heard doesn't come from these > oriental countries it comes from wandering Australians.\\" (Lamb) \\"For these > years of course in the past Sir Robert you have been described as a racist.\\" > (Menzies) \\"Have I?\\" (Lamb) \\"I have read this, yes.\\" (Menzies) \\"Well if I > were not described as a racist I'd be the only public man who hasn't been.\\" In 1963, a paper \\"Immigration: Control or Colour Bar?\\" was published by a group of students and academics at Melbourne University. It proposed eliminating the White Australia policy, and was influential towards this end. =End of the White Australia policy= Harold Holt. The Holt Government effectively dismantled the White Australia policy. In 1966, the Holt Liberal Government effectively dismantled the White Australia policy and increased access to non-European migrants, including refugees fleeing the Vietnam War. After a review of immigration policy in March 1966, Immigration Minister Hubert Opperman announced applications for migration would be accepted from well-qualified people \\"on the basis of their suitability as settlers, their ability to integrate readily and their possession of qualifications positively useful to Australia\\". At the same time, Harold Holt's government decided to allow foreign non-whites to become permanent residents and citizens after five years (the same as for Europeans), and also removed discriminatory provisions in family reunification policies. As a result, annual non-European settler arrivals rose from 746 in 1966 to 2,696 in 1971, while annual part-European settler arrivals rose from 1,498 to 6,054. Leader of the Labor Party from 1960 to 1967 Arthur Calwell supported the White European Australia policy. This is reflected by Calwell's comments in his 1972 memoirs, Be Just and Fear Not, in which he made it clear that he maintained his view that non-European people should not be allowed to settle in Australia. He wrote: > I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, > a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from > black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man > at all. And any man who tries to stigmatise the Australian community as > racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is > doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that > Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and > survive.Calwell, Be Just and Fear Not, 117 The legal end of the White Australia policy is usually placed in the year 1973, when the Whitlam Labor government implemented a series of amendments preventing the enforcement of racial aspects of the immigration law. These amendments: * Legislated that all migrants, regardless of origin, be eligible to obtain citizenship after three years of permanent residence. * Ratified all international agreements relating to immigration and race. * Issued policy to totally disregard race as a factor in selecting migrants. The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 made the use of racial criteria for any official purpose illegal. It was not until the Fraser Liberal government's review of immigration law in 1978 that all selection of prospective migrants based on country of origin was entirely removed from official policy. In 1981, the Minister for Immigration announced a Special Humanitarian Assistance Programme (SHP) for Iranians to seek refuge in Australia and by 1988 some 2,500 Bah√° º√≠s and many more others had arrived in Australia through either SHP or Refugee Programmes. The last selective immigration policy, offering relocation assistance to British nationals, was finally removed in 1982. =Aftermath= Australia's contemporary immigration programme has two components: a programme for skilled and family migrants and a humanitarian programme for refugees and asylum seekers. By 2010, the post-war immigration programme had received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. The population tripled in the six decades to around 21 million in 2010, comprising people originating from 200 countries. Legacy Non-European and non-Christian immigration has increased substantially since the dismantling of the White Australia policy. = Religious legacy = The policy had the effect of creating a population of overwhelmingly European, and largely Anglo-Celtic, descent. In refusing immigration by people of other ethnic origins, it also effectively limited the immigration of practitioners of non-Christian faiths. Consequently, the White Australia policy ensured that Christianity remained the religion of the overwhelming majority of Australians. See drop-down essay on \\"Independence and Aboriginal Policy\\" =Contemporary demographics= Today, Australia has the world's eighth-largest immigrant population, with immigrants accounting for 29% of the population, a higher proportion than in any other nation with a population of over 10 million.United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, (2015). 'International Migration' in International migrant stock 2015. Accessed from International migrant stock 2015: maps on 24 May 2017 162,417 permanent immigrants were admitted to Australia in 2017‚Äì18. Most immigrants are skilled, but the immigration quota includes categories for family members and refugees. In 2018 the five largest immigrant groups were those born in England (4%), Mainland China (2.6%), India (2.4%), New Zealand (2.3%) and the Philippines (1.1%). In the 2016 Australian census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were: * English (36.1%) * Australian (33.5%) * Irish (11.0%) * Scottish (9.3%) * Chinese (5.6%) * Italian (4.6%) * German (4.5%) * Indian (2.8%) * Indigenous (2.8%) * Greek (1.8%) * Dutch (1.6%) * Filipino (1.4%) * Vietnamese (1.4%) * Lebanese (1%) =Political and social legacy= The story of Australia since the Second World War ‚Äì and particularly since the final relegation of the white Australia policy ‚Äì has been one of ever-increasing ethnic and cultural diversity. Successive governments have sustained a large programmes of multiethnic immigration from all continents. Discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity was legally sanctioned until 1975. Australia's new official policy on racial diversity is: \\"to build on our success as a culturally diverse, accepting and open society, united through a shared future\\". The White Australia policy continues to be mentioned in modern contexts, although it is generally only mentioned by politicians when denouncing their opposition. As Leader of the Opposition, John Howard argued for restricting Asian immigration in 1988 as part of his One Australia policy; in August 1988, he said: > I do believe that if it is ‚Äì in the eyes of some in the community ‚Äì that > it's too great, it would be in our immediate-term interest and supporting of > social cohesion if it [Asian immigration] were slowed down a little, so the > capacity of the community to absorb it was greater. Howard later retracted and apologised for the remarks, and was returned to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1995. The Howard Government (1996‚Äì2007) in turn ran a large programme of non-discriminatory immigration and, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Asian countries became an increasingly important source of immigration over the decade from 1996 to 2006, with the proportion of migrants from Southern and Central Asian countries doubling from 7% to 14%. The proportion of immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa also increased. By 2005‚Äì06, China and India were the third and fourth largest sources of all migration (after New Zealand and the United Kingdom). In 2005‚Äì06, there were 180,000 permanent additions of migrants to Australia (72% more than the number in 1996‚Äì97). This figure included around 17,000 through the humanitarian programme, of whom Iraqis and Sudanese accounted for the largest portions. China became Australia's biggest source of migrants, for the first time in 2009, surpassing New Zealand and Britain. The Australian historian John Fitzgerald wrote that the White Australia policy with its definition that to be Australian was to be white had a powerful impact on forging the identity of the Chinese-Australian community as a marginalised community.Fitzgerald, John Big White Lie: Chinese Australians in White Australia, Sydney, NSW: UNSW Press (2007), p.4-5, Fitzgerald noted that even in the early 21st century that many Chinese-Australians who had been born and grew up in Australia automatically referred to white Australians as \\"the Australians\\" and to themselves as \\"the Chinese\\".Fitzgerald, John Big White Lie: Chinese Australians in White Australia, Sydney, NSW: UNSW Press (2007), p.5, Historian Geoffrey Blainey achieved mainstream recognition for the anti- multiculturalist cause when he wrote that multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a \\"cluster of tribes\\". In his 1984 book All for Australia, Blainey criticised multiculturalism for tending to \\"emphasise the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority of Australians\\" and also for tending to be \\"anti-British\\", even though \\"people from the United Kingdom and Ireland form the dominant class of pre-war immigrants and the largest single group of post-war immigrants.\\" According to Blainey, such a policy, with its \\"emphasis on what is different and on the rights of the new minority rather than the old majority,\\" was unnecessarily creating division and threatened national cohesion. He argued that \\"the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high\\" and warned that \\"we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world.\\"Blainey, G. (1984). All For Australia, North Ryde, NSW: Methuen Haynes () In one of his numerous criticisms of multiculturalism, Blainey wrote: > For the millions of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, > multiculturalism is almost an insult. It is divisive. It threatens social > cohesion. It could, in the long-term, also endanger Australia's military > security because it sets up enclaves which in a crisis could appeal to their > own homelands for help. Blainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as \\"morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham\\". The British historian Andrew Roberts in his 2006 book A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900 praised the White Australia policy as being necessary to \\"protect Australia as an English-speaking nation\\". Roberts wrote the White Australia policy was the \\"right\\" immigration policy to pursue as he accused Asian peoples of spreading infectious diseases and stated \\"Australia had the right (and duty) to protect herself\\" from Asian immigration. Views such as those expressed by Roberts have been in the minority. In 2009, the Australian historian Erin Ihde described the White Australia policy as \\"discredited\\" both within the historians' community and with the general public. Ihde wrote that the White Australia policy remains a difficult subject within the Australian popular memory of the past as it was the fear of the so-called \\"Yellow Peril\\" in the form of Asian immigration and the possibility of Asian nations such as China and Japan posing a military threat to Australia that played a major role in the formation of the Australian federation in 1901. Ihde argued the White Australia policy was not an aberration in Australian history, nor was it marginal, making it problematic to integrate into a positive view of Australian history. Despite the overall success and generally bipartisan support for Australia's multi- ethnic immigration programme, there remain voices of opposition to immigration within the Australian electorate. At its peak, Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party received 9% of the national vote at the 1998 Federal Election. Hanson was widely accused of trying to take Australia back to the days of the White Australia policy, particularly through reference to Arthur Calwell, one of the policy's strongest supporters. In her maiden address to the Australian Parliament following the 1996 election, Hanson said: > I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and > that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being > swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming > into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and > religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate. Hanson's remarks generated wide interest in the media both nationally and internationally, but she herself did not retain her seat in Parliament at the 1998 election or subsequent 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Hanson also failed to win election in the 2003 and 2011 New South Wales state elections. In May 2007, Hanson, with her new Pauline's United Australia Party, continued her call for a freeze on immigration, arguing that African migrants carried disease into Australia. Hanson returned to politics in 2014 and ran in the Queensland election. Topics related to racism and immigration in Australia are still regularly connected by the media to the White Australia policy. Some examples of issues and events where this connection has been made include: reconciliation with Indigenous Australians; mandatory detention and the \\"Pacific Solution\\"; the 2005 Cronulla riots, and the 2009 attacks on Indians in Australia. Former opposition Labor party leader Mark Latham, in his book The Latham Diaries, described the ANZUS alliance as a legacy of the White Australia policy. In 2007, the Howard Government proposed an Australian Citizenship Test intended \\"to get that balance between diversity and integration correct in future, particularly as we now draw people from so many different countries and so many different cultures\\". The draft proposal contained a pamphlet introducing Australian history, Culture and Democracy. Migrants were to be required to correctly answer at least 12 out of 20 questions on such topics in a citizenship quiz. Migrants would also be required to demonstrate an adequate level of understanding of the English language. The Rudd Government reviewed and then implemented the proposal in 2009. On 14 August 2018 Senator Fraser Anning delivered his maiden speech to the Senate. In it, he called for a plebiscite to reintroduce the White Australia Policy, especially with regard to excluding Muslims. He was criticised by politicians from the left and the right, in particular for his choice of words (\\"final solution\\"). He again caused outrage and was criticised by politicians across the board after blaming Muslim migrants to New Zealand for the 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks.

It is also the river with the most voluminous flow of water by far in all of England and Wales, discharging an average of into the Bristol Channel at Apperley, Gloucestershire. It rises in the Cambrian Mountains in mid Wales, at an altitude of , on the Plynlimon massif, which lies close to the Ceredigion/Powys border near Llanidloes. The river then flows through Shropshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. The three county towns of Shrewsbury, Worcester and Gloucester lie on its course. The Severn's major tributaries are the Vyrnwy, the Tern, the Teme, the Warwickshire Avon, and the Worcestershire Stour. By convention, the River Severn is usually considered to end, and the Severn Estuary to begin, after the Second Severn Crossing, between Severn Beach in South Gloucestershire and Sudbrook, Monmouthshire. The total area of the Estuary‚Äôs drainage basin is . That figure excludes the area of the River Wye and the Bristol Avon, both of which flow into the Severn Estuary. The Estuary discharges into the Bristol Channel, which opens into the Celtic Sea and from there into the Atlantic Ocean. Etymology and mythology The name Severn is thought to derive from a British *sabrinƒÅ, possibly from an older form *samarina, meaning \\"land of summertime fallow‚Äù. The name is recorded in the latinized form Sabrina in the 2nd century. The Welsh form of the name is ', first recorded in the 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae. Milton's 1634 masque Comus makes Sabrina a nymph who had drowned in the river. In Shrewsbury, there is now a statue of Sabrina in the Dingle Gardens at the Quarry, as well as a metal sculpture erected in 2013. There is a different deity associated with the Severn Estuary: Nodens, represented as mounted on a seahorse, riding on the crest of the Severn bore. Geography and geology The River Severn's current form is the result of a multi-million year history and complex underlying geology but is in part the result of glaciation during the last ice age in the Pleistocene epoch of the Quaternary period. Within Wales, the river runs through a landscape formed in Ordovician and Silurian rocks. As it enters the Shropshire Plain, these lower Palaeozoic rocks are replaced by Permian and Triassic age strata though largely unseen beneath a thick cover of Quaternary deposits. Certain stretches also run across Carboniferous strata as at Shrewsbury and for much of the distance between Ironbridge and Bewdley. Permo-Triassic bedrock then continues until the Severn moves intermittently onto the Jurassic outcrop from Tewkesbury southwards. Only in the SSW-NNE aligned valley either side of Welshpool is there any obvious relationship to geological structure; the valley follows the lines of the Severn Valley Faults. For much of the rest of its course it runs directly across geological structures. It was first proposed in the 1900‚Äôs that the former northerly course of the upper Severn was disrupted during the course of the ice age by the blocking of its access to the Irish Sea through Cheshire causing a large lake to develop across much of Shropshire. It was supposed that this lake, named as Lake Lapworth, overtopped its southern margin and rapidly cut down to form the Ironbridge Gorge providing the Severn with a southerly exit to the sea as remains the case today. An alternative theory which has gained favour in recent years does away with Lake Lapworth, suggesting that the upper Severn flowed beneath the icesheet in a bedrock hollow known as the Severn Trench eastwards from Melverley to the Ironbridge Gorge. It is possible that the trench and gorge were cut over successive ice ages. Tributary rivers Over its length, there are a large number of tributaries but the three largest feeding the non-tidal river are the Vyrnwy, the Teme and the Warwickshire Avon. The Wye, the Bristol Avon and the Usk all flow into the estuarine section of the Severn. The main tributaries are described in sequence below. The first tributary of significance is the Afon Dulas joining from the south immediately upstream of Llanidloes with the Afon Clywedog joining in the town. The Afon Cerist, bolstered by the Afon Trannon, and the Afon Carno join as left bank tributaries immediately upstream of Caersws. Mochdre Brook enters on the western edge of Newtown followed by the Bechan Brook just northeast of the town. The Mule enters at Abermule and the River Rhiw east of Berriew followed shortly by the Camlad which rises above Churchstoke and by the Luggy Brook. The left bank Sylfaen Brook enters at Welshpool and the Bele Brook via the New Cut east of Arddlin. The River Vyrnwy, which begins at Lake Vyrnwy, flows eastwards through Powys gathering the waters of the Banwy, Cain and Tanat before forming part of the border between England and Wales, and joining the Severn near Melverley, Shropshire. The River Perry joins on the left bank above Shrewsbury whilst both the Rad Brook and the Rea Brook, which flows north from its source in the Stiperstones, join the Severn within the city. The left bank tributary, the River Tern, after flowing south from Market Drayton and being joined by the River Meese and the River Roden, meets the Severn at Attingham Park. The River Worfe joins the Severn's left bank, just above Bridgnorth before the Mor, Borle and Dowles brooks join on the opposite bank over the next few miles, the last-named draining Wyre Forest. The River Stour rises in the north of Worcestershire in the Clent Hills, near St Kenelm's Church at Romsley. It flows north into the adjacent West Midlands at Halesowen. It then flows westwards through Cradley Heath and Stourbridge where it leaves the Black Country. It is joined by the Smestow Brook at Prestwood before it winds around southwards to Kinver, and then flows back into Worcestershire. It then passes through Wolverley, Kidderminster and Wilden to its confluence with the Severn at Stourport-on-Severn. The Dick Brook, Shrawley Brook and Grimley Brook enter on the right bank before the River Salwarpe which runs through Droitwich enters on the opposite (east) bank. The River Teme flows eastwards from its source in Mid Wales, straddling the border between Shropshire and Herefordshire, it is joined by the River Onny, River Corve and River Rea before it finally joins the Severn on the southern edge of Worcester. Bushley Brook joins just upstream of the confluence of the Warwickshire Avon with the Severn at Tewkesbury. One of several Avons, this one flows west through Rugby, Warwick and Stratford-upon-Avon. It is then joined by its tributary the River Arrow, before joining the Severn. The rivers Swilgate and Chelt also join the Severn's left bank, as do the Hatherley and Horsbere brooks before it reaches Gloucester. The River Leadon enters the tidal West Channel of the Severn at Over, immediately west of Gloucester. The River Frome is the second significant tributary to enter the tidal stretch of the Severn, doing so at Framilode. Bideford Brook drains the easternmost part of the Forest of Dean, entering the Severn estuary east of Blakeney. On the opposite (southeast) bank the flow of the River Cam is usurped by the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal before reaching the estuary. The Lyd enters the west bank of the estuary at Lydney Harbour opposite the place where Berkeley Pill carries the waters of the Little Avon River into it. The final tributary before the Severn Bridge is the collection of streams which enter via Oldbury Pill. The River Wye, from its source in Plynlimon in Wales ( from the source of the Severn), flows generally south east through the Welsh towns of Rhayader and Builth Wells. It enters Herefordshire, flows through Hereford, and is shortly afterwards joined by the River Lugg, before flowing through Ross-on-Wye and Monmouth, and then southwards where it forms part of the boundary between England (Forest of Dean) and Wales. It flows into the Severn estuary south of the town of Chepstow. The Mounton and Nedern brooks enter on the Monmouthshire side between the two motorway crossings. The Port of Bristol is on the Severn Estuary, where another River Avon flows into it through the Avon Gorge. The River Usk and the Ebbw River flow into the Severn Estuary at Uskmouth just south of Newport. Settlements source of the River Severn on Plynlimon, Wales. The wording is in both English and Welsh. Rowing boat (8-man + cox) at Worcester Worcester Cathedral overlooking the Severn High Town, Bridgnorth. The river's course within Wales lies wholly within the county of Powys. The first town it encounters downstream of its source is Llanidloes where it is joined by the Dulas and the Clywedog. It flows past the villages of Llandinam and Caersws before reaching Newtown. It then runs by Abermule and Cilcewydd before flowing beside Welshpool, the last town on its course in Wales. Entering Shropshire and England, a few villages such as Shrawardine sit back from the river as it meanders eastwards towards the county town of Shrewsbury. More villages, notably Atcham, Wroxeter and Cressage sit beside the river as it turns southeast and heads for the gorge at Ironbridge before turning south for Bridgnorth. The Shropshire villages of Quatford and Hampton Loade and the Worcestershire village of Upper Arley follow, before the Severn runs through Bewdley and Stourport-on-Severn in quick succession. The river then passes the villages of Astley Burf and Holt Fleet before entry into the county town of Worcester. Several villages sit back from the river before it runs by Upton- upon-Severn and then enters Gloucestershire as it joins with the Warwickshire Avon outside of Tewkesbury. A few more villages intervene, notable amongst which is Maisemore before the river enters the county town of Gloucester from which point it is tidal. Several more villages sit beside the tidal stretch. Amongst these are Elmore, Epney and Framilode on the east bank and Minsterworth, Broadoak and Newnham on Severn on the west bank. Transport =Bridges= Welsh Bridge (background) and Frankwell Footbridge (foreground) in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. The Severn bridged by the A49 road just outside Shrewsbury. The village of Uffington, Shropshire is in the foreground. The Severn is bridged at many places, and many of these bridges are notable in their own right. The Iron Bridge at Ironbridge was the world's first iron arch bridge. Several other bridges crossing the river were designed and built by the engineer Thomas Telford. The two major road bridges of the Severn crossing link south eastern Wales with the southern counties of England. *Severn Bridge ‚Äì opened in 1966 carrying what is now the M48 *Second Severn Crossing ‚Äì opened in 1996 carrying the M4 motorway Prior to the construction of the first bridge in 1966, the channel was crossed by the Aust Ferry. Other notable bridges include: * Buttington Bridge ‚Äì built in 1872 * Montford Bridge ‚Äì Thomas Telford's first ever bridge design, built between 1790 and 1792 * Welsh Bridge ‚Äì in the centre of Shrewsbury, built in 1795 at a cost of ¬£8,000 * English Bridge ‚Äì also in Shrewsbury, designed and completed in 1774 by John Gwynn * Atcham Bridges ‚Äì the old one built in 1774, while the newer one in 1929 carries the B4380 * Albert Edward Bridge ‚Äì in Coalbrookdale, a railway bridge opened in 1864 * Coalport Bridge ‚Äì like its neighbour Ironbridge, is made of cast iron, built in 1818 * Victoria Bridge ‚Äì designed by John Fowler, opened in 1862.

The original line built before the Severn Tunnel was the South Wales Railway from Gloucester, that followed the estuary alongside present day stations of Lydney, Chepstow, Caldicot and Severn Tunnel Junction to Newport. Cars could also be transported through the Severn Tunnel. In the 1950s three trains a day made round trips between Severn Tunnel Junction and Pilning. The vehicles were loaded onto open flat bed carriages and pulled by a small pannier tank locomotive, although sometimes they were joined to a scheduled passenger train. The prudent owner paid to cover the vehicle with a sheet, as sparks often flew when the steam locomotive tackled the slope leading to the tunnel exit. A railway coach was provided for passengers and drivers. Reservations could be made and the fee for the car was about thirty shillings (¬£1.50) in the early 1950s. =Disasters= Tewkesbury during the 2007 floods There have been many disasters on the Severn, which have claimed perhaps 300 lives, depending on sources, especially during the 20th century. The Severn Railway Bridge was badly damaged by the collision of two river barges in 1960, which led to its demolition in 1970. Five crew members of both the Arkendale H and Wastdale H died in the accident.Ron Huxley, The Rise and Fall of the Severn Bridge Railway, 1984, More recently the river flooded during the 2007 United Kingdom floods and the 2019‚Äì20 United Kingdom floods. =Navigation= Navigation light on Chapel Rock near Beachley There is a public right of navigation between Pool Quay, near Welshpool, and Stourport. However this stretch of the river has little traffic, other than small boats, canoes and some tour boats in Shrewsbury. Below Stourport, where the river is more navigable for larger craft, users must obtain permits from the Canal & River Trust, who are the navigation authority. During spring freshet the river can be closed to navigation. At Upper Parting above Gloucester, the river divides into two, and flows either side of Alney Island to Lower Parting. The West Channel is no longer navigable. The East Channel is navigable as far as Gloucester Docks, from where the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal provides a navigable channel south. Between the docks and Lower Parting Llanthony Weir marks the Normal Tidal Limit (NTL) of the East Channel of the river. In the tidal section of the river below Gloucester, the Gloucester Harbour Trustees are the competent harbour authority. The Trustees maintain navigation lights at various points along the river (including on Chapel Rock and Lyde Rock, and leading lights at Slime Road, Sheperdine and Berkeley Pill). =Locks= There are locks on the lower Severn to enable seagoing boats to reach as far as Stourport. The most northerly lock is at Lincombe, about downstream from Stourport. =Associated canals= The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, (both narrow beam) and the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal join the Severn at Stourport, Worcester and Gloucester respectively. The Droitwich Barge Canal, a broad beam canal, joins the Severn at Hawford, near to the River Salwarpe, and connects to the Droitwich Canal (narrow beam) in the name town, which then forms a link to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. The two Droitwich canals re-opened in 2010 after major restoration. The Gloucester and Sharpness Canal connects the Severn at Gloucester to the Severn at Sharpness, avoiding a stretch of the tidal river which is dangerous to navigate. The Stroudwater Navigation used to join the tidal Severn at Framilode, but since the 1920s has connected to the Severn only via the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. The Lydney Canal is a short canal which connects Lydney to the river. The section of the river between Tewkesbury and Worcester forms part of the Avon Ring, a circular cruising route which includes 129 locks and covers parts of three other waterways. =Passenger transport= The tidal river Paddle steamers were operated in the Severn Estuary from the mid 19th century to the late 1970s by P & A Campbell of Bristol. The vessels, Cardiff Queen, Bristol Queen, Glen Usk, Glen Gower and Britannia all operated on this route in the 1950s and 1960s. Since 1986 Waverley Excursions has operated occasional sailings to Sharpness and Lydney by the MV Balmoral.Waverley Excursions website A number of ferries were also operated on the tidal river, for example at New Passage, Purton and Arlingham. The last ferry was the Aust Ferry, which closed in 1966 when the Severn Bridge opened. One of the Aust ferries, Severn Princess, is still in Chepstow although largely derelict. The upper river In Worcester, the Worcester River Cruises have boat trips up and down the river between Tewkesbury and Stourport, operating the boats The Pride of the Midlands and The Earl Grosvenor.Worcester River Cruises website The Cathedral Ferry, a foot passenger ferry, also operates on summer weekends from the steps of Worcester Cathedral. In Shropshire the Hampton Loade Ferry used to operate across the river though has been closed since 2016. In Shrewsbury, boat trips around the loop of the town centre are at present provided by the Sabrina and depart from Victoria Quay near the Welsh Bridge during the summer. Severn Estuary Severn bridges crossing near the mouth of the River Severn The river becomes tidal close to Maisemore, on the West Channel just north of Gloucester, and at Llanthony Weir on the East Channel. The tidal river downstream from Gloucester is sometimes referred to as the Severn Estuary, but the river is usually considered to become the Severn Estuary after the Second Severn Crossing near Severn Beach, South Gloucestershire (the point to which the jurisdiction of the Gloucester Harbour Trustees extends), or at Aust, the site of the Severn Bridge. The Severn Estuary extends to a line from Lavernock Point (south of Cardiff) to Sand Point near Weston-super-Mare. West of this line is the Bristol Channel. In the Severn Estuary (or the Bristol Channel in the last two cases, depending where the boundary is drawn) are the rocky islands called Denny Island, Steep Holm and Flat Holm. The estuary is about wide at Aust, and about wide between Cardiff and Weston-super-Mare. Severn Sea Until Tudor times the Bristol Channel was known as the Severn Sea, and it is still known as this in both Welsh and Cornish (M√¥r Hafren and Mor Havren respectively, with M√¥r meaning Sea). Severn bore Bore hitting the riverbank in 1994 A phenomenon associated with the lower reaches of the Severn is the tidal bore, which forms upstream of the port of Sharpness. It is frequently asserted that the river's estuary, which empties into the Bristol Channel, has the second largest tidal range in the world‚Äî, exceeded only by the Bay of Fundy. However a tidal range greater than that of the Severn is recorded from the lesser known Ungava Bay in Canada. During the highest tides, the rising water is funnelled up the Severn estuary into a wave that travels rapidly upstream against the river current. The largest bores occur in spring, but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. The bore is accompanied by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after the bore has passed. Industry A stretch of the River Severn in Shropshire, is known as Ironbridge Gorge. It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986. Its historic importance is due to its role as the centre of the iron industry in the early stages of the Industrial Revolution. The gorge and the village of Ironbridge get their name from the Iron Bridge across the Severn, built in 1779, which was the first cast-iron arch bridge ever constructed. Two nuclear power stations are situated on the river, in the area of South Gloucestershire. Oldbury Nuclear Power Station and Berkeley Nuclear Power Station both made use of the River Severn as part of the power generation and nuclear cooling processes. Both are now decommissioned. Wildlife The sides of the estuary are also important feeding grounds for waders, notably at the Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserve and the Slimbridge Wildfowl Trust. River shingle habitat can also be found on the lower estuary, notable for its population of the endangered 5-spot Ladybird. The river forms part of the Severn-Trent flyway, a route used by migratory birds to cross Great Britain.  Literary and musical allusions  The River Severn is named several times in A.E. Housman's A Shropshire Lad (1896): \\"It dawns in Asia, tombstones show/And Shropshire names are read;/And the Nile spills his overflow/Beside the Severn's dead\\" (‚Äú1887\\"); \\"Severn stream\\" (‚ÄúThe Welsh Marches\\"); and \\"Severn shore\\" (‚ÄúWestward from the high-hilled plain...‚Äù). In William Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1, Henry Hotspur Percy recalls the valour of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March in a long battle against Welshman Owain Glynd≈µr upon the Severn's banks, claiming the flooding Severn \\"affrighted with (the warriors') bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank, bloodstained with these valiant combatants.\\" The Severn was the inspiration for a number of works by Gloucestershire composer Ivor Gurney, including the songs \\"Western Sailors\\" (1925) and \\"Severn Meadows\\" (1917). Gloucestershire writer and poet Brian Waters published Severn Tide with J. M. Dent in 1947 and followed it with Severn Stream in 1949. With anecdotal stories about his travels, both books tell of the lives of the people who lived and worked on and along the river, describing the landscape with a poet's eye. Waters links Nodens with the Seven Bore and the association of the Celtic deity with the river is explored at length by Rogers. Several 20th-century English composers wrote works inspired by the river. Gerald Finzi (1901-1956) wrote A Severn Rhapsody, his Opus 3, in 1923; taking the Severn River and its surrounding countryside as his inspiration. Edward Elgar (1857-1934) wrote The Severn Suite, Opus 87, in 1930. Elgar lived much of both his early life and his later life near Worcester, through which the Severn runs. Herbert Howells (1892-1983), born close to the Severn in Lydney, wrote the complex Missa Sabrinensis (Mass of the Severn) in 1954, and an earlier hymn tune simply entitled Severn. The Severn is often mentioned in Ellis Peters' The Cadfael Chronicles, set in or around Shrewsbury Abbey, beside the river. In Julian Barnes' 2011 novel, The Sense of an Ending, Tony, the main character, recalls \\"a river rushing nonsensically upstream, its wave and wash lit by half a dozen chasing torchbeams,\\" an allusion to a visit to the Severn Bore.

Tunis is the capital and the largest city (population over 800,000); it is near the ancient site of the city of Carthage. Throughout its recorded history, the physical features and environment of the land of Tunisia have remained fairly constant, although during ancient times more abundant forests grew in the north,Cf., LaVerle Berry and Robert Rinehart, \\"The Society and Its Environment\\" pp. 71‚Äì143, 79, in Nelson (editor), Tunisia.

The Medjerda river valley (Wadi Majardah, northeast of Tunis) is currently valuable farmland. Along the eastern coast the central plains enjoy a moderate climate with less rainfall but significant precipitation in the form of heavy dews; these coastlands are currently used for orchards and grazing.

Seasonal migration routes evidence their ancient journeys. Saharan rock art, consisting of inscriptions and paintings that show design patterns as well as figures of animals and of humans, are attributed to the Berbers and also to black Africans from the south. Dating these outdoor art works has proven difficult and unsatisfactory.Lloyd Cabot Briggs, Tribes of the Sahara (Harvard Univ. & Oxford Univ. 1960) pp. 38‚Äì40.P. Salama, \\"The Sahara in Classical Antiquity\\" pp. 286‚Äì295, 291, in General History of Africa, volume II. Ancient Civilizations of Africa (UNESCO 1990), Abridged Edition. Egyptian influence is thought very unlikely. Among the animals depicted, alone or in staged scenes, are large-horned buffalo (the extinct bubalus antiquus), elephants, donkeys, colts, rams, herds of cattle, a lion and lioness with three cubs, leopards or cheetahs, hogs, jackals, rhinoceroses, giraffes, hippopotamus, a hunting dog, and various antelope. Human hunters may wear animal masks and carry their weapons. Herders are shown with elaborate head ornamentation; a few other human figures are shown dancing, while others are driving chariots or riding camels.C.B.M.McBurney, The Stone Age of Northern Africa (Pelican 1960) pp. 258‚Äì266. By five thousand years ago, a neolithic culture was evolving among the sedentary proto-Berbers of the Maghrib in northwest Africa, characterized by the practice of agriculture and animal domestication, as well as the making of pottery and finely chipped stone arrowheads.Lloyd Cabot Briggs, Tribes of the Sahara (Harvard Univ. & Oxford Univ. 1960) pp. 34‚Äì36. They planted wheat, barley, beans and chick peas in their fields, and used ceramic bowls and basins, goblets, plates, and large cooking dishes daily. These were stored by hanging on the walls of their domiciles. Archaeological evidence shows these proto-Berbers were already \\"farmers with a strong pastoral element in their economy and fairly elaborate cemeteries,\\" well over a thousand years before the Phoenicians arrived to found Carthage. Individual wealth was measured among the nomadic herders of the south by the number of sheep, goats, and cattle a man possessed. Finds of scraps of cloth woven in stripes of different colors indicate that these groups wove fabrics.J.Desanges, \\"The proto-Berbers\\" pp. 236‚Äì245, 241‚Äì243, in General History of Africa, volume II.

The religion of the ancient Berbers is undocumented and only funerary rites can be reconstructed from archaeological evidence. Burial sites provide an early indication of religious beliefs; almost sixty thousand tombs are located in the Fezzan alone, according to the Italian scholar Giacomo Caputo. A more recent tomb, the Medracen in eastern Algeria, still stands. Built for a Berber king and traditionally assigned to Masinissa (r. 202‚Äì149 BC), it may have belonged instead to his father Gala (or Gaia). The architecture of the elegant tower tomb of his contemporary Syphax shows Greek or Punic influence.Tomb of Syphax is at Siga near Oran. Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996) pp. 27‚Äì31. Most other information about Berber religious beliefs comes from later, classical times. The Libyans believed that divine power showed itself in the natural world, and could, for example, inhabit bodies of water or reside in stones, which were objects of worship. Procreative power was symbolized by the bull, the lion, and the ram. Among the proto-Berbers in the area that is now Tunisia, images of fish, often found in mosaics excavated there, were phallic symbols that fended off the evil eye, while sea shells signified the female sex.J.Desanges, \\"The proto-Berbers\\" pp. 236‚Äì245, 243, in General History of Africa, volume II. Ancient Civilizations of Africa (UNESCO 1990), Abridged Edition. Herodotus mentions that Libyans of the Nasamone tribe slept on the graves of their ancestors in order to induce dreams for divination. Libyans sacrificed to the sun and to the moon (Ayyur).Herodotus (c.484‚Äìc.425), The Histories IV, 172‚Äì174, 188 (Penguin 1954, 1972) p. 329 (divination), 333‚Äì334 (sun and moon). Eventually supernatural entities became personalized as gods, perhaps influenced by Egyptian or Punic practice; yet the Berbers seemed to be \\"drawn more to the sacred than to the gods.\\"J.Desanges, \\"The proto-Berbers\\" pp. 236‚Äì245, 243‚Äì245, 245, in General History of Africa, volume II. Ancient Civilizations of Africa (UNESCO 1990), Abridged Edition. Often only a little more than the names of the Berber deities are known, e.g., Bonchar, a leading god.There is a third century A.D. relief from ancient Vaga (now B√©ja, Tunisia), with Latin inscription, which shows seven Berber gods (the Dii Mauri or Mauran gods) seated on a bench: Bonchar in the center with a staff (master of the pantheon), to his right sits the goddess Vihina with an infant at her feet (childbirth?), to her right is Macurgum holding a scroll and a serpent entwined staff (health?), to Bonchar's left is Varsissima (without attributes), and to her left is Matilam evidently presiding over the sacrifice of a boar; at. the ends are Macurtan holding a bucket and Iunam (moon?). Aicha Ben Abad Ben Khader and David Soren, Carthage: A Mosaid of Ancient Tunisia (American Museum of Natural History 1987) pp. 139‚Äì140. Eventually, Berbero- Libyans came to adopt elements from ancient Egyptian religion. Herodotus writes of the divine oracle sourced in the Egyptian god Ammon located among the Libyans, at the oasis of Siwa.The Libyan oracle was sister to the divine oracle of Dodona in Greece, according to Herodotus (c.484‚Äìc.425), in his The Histories II, 55‚Äì56 (Penguin 1954, 1972) pp. 153‚Äì154. Later, Berber beliefs influenced the religion of Carthage, the city-state founded by the Phoenicians.Soren, Ben Abad Ben Khader, Slim, Carthage (New York: Simon and Schuster 1990) pp. 26‚Äì27 (fusion with Tanit), 243‚Äì244.Cf., Julian Baldick, Black God: Afroasiatic Roots of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Religions (London: I.B.Tauris 1997). Egyptian hieroglyphs from the early dynasties also testify to Libyans, the Berbers of the \\"western desert\\".The Palermo Stone (named for the Museo Archeologico Regionale in Palermo, where much of it is kept), also called the Libyan Stone, contains a list of the earliest pharaohs up to the Fifth dynasty of Egypt (2487‚Äì2348) as well as about fifty prior rulers. Some consider these fifty earlier rulers to be Libyan Berbers, from whom the pharaohs derived. Helene F. Hagan, \\"Book Review\\" of Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996), at paragraph \\"a\\". First mentioned as the Tehenou during the pre-dynastic reigns of Scorpion II (c. 3050) and of Narmer (on an ivory cylinder), their appearance is later disclosed in a bas relief of the Fifth Dynasty temple of Sahure. Ramses II (r. 1279‚Äì1213) placed Libyan contingents in his army.J.Desanges, \\"The proto-Berbers\\" pp. 236‚Äì245, 238‚Äì240, in General History of Africa, volume II. Ancient Civilizations of Africa (UNESCO 1990), Abridged Edition. Tombs of the 13th century BC show paintings of Libu leaders wearing fine robes, with ostrich feathers in their \\"dreadlocks\\", short pointed beards, and tattoos on their shoulders and arms. Evidently, Osorkon the Elder (Akheperre setepenamun), a Berber of the Meshwesh tribe, became the first Libyan pharaoh. Several decades later, his nephew Shoshenq I (r. 945‚Äì924) became Pharaoh of Egypt, and the founder of its Twenty-second Dynasty (945‚Äì715).Hornung, Erik (1999) History of Ancient Egypt: An Introduction Ithaca: Cornell University Press. pp. xv; 52‚Äì54; xvii-xviii; 128‚Äì133. . In 818 the ruling Bubastid house split, both of its Berber Meshwesh branches continuing to rule, one later called the 23rd Dynasty. (Hornung (1999) page 131.Almost two millennia later a Fatimid Berber army would again occupy Egypt from the west, and establish a dynasty there. In 926 Shoshenq I (thought to be Shishak of the Bible) successfully campaigned to Jerusalem then ruled by Solomon's heir.2 Chronicles 12:2‚Äì9.Hornung, Erik (1999) History of Ancient Egypt: An Introduction Ithaca: Cornell University Press. page 129. . For several centuries Egypt was governed by a decentralized system based on the Libyan tribal organization of the Meshwesh. Becoming acculturated, Libyans also served as high priests at Egyptian religious centers.Hornung, Erik (1999): page 129 and page 131. Hence during the classical era of the Mediterranean, all of the Berber peoples of Northwest Africa were often known collectively as Libyans.Cf., Herodotus (c.484‚Äìc.425), The Histories IV, 167‚Äì201 (Penguin 1954, 1972) pp. 328‚Äì337; the Garamantes of the Libyan desert (the Fezzan) pp. 329, 332. Farther west, foreigners knew some Berbers as Gaetulians (who lived in remote areas), and those Bebers more familiar as the Numidians, and as the Mauri or Maurisi (later the Moors).Yet these names (Mauri from which Moor) have been used by ancient and medieval authors to designate also black Africans coming from south of the Sahara. Frank M. Snowden, Jr., Blacks in Antiquity: Ethiopians in the Greco-Roman Experience (Harvard University 1970) pp. 11‚Äì14. These Berber peoples interacted with Phoenicia and Carthage (who also used the name \\"Libyphoenicians\\"), and later with Rome. Yet prior to this era of history, sedentary rural Berbers apparently lived in semi-independent farming villages, composed of small tribal units under a local leader.Soren, Ben Khader, Slim, Carthage (Simon and Schuster 1990) pp. 44‚Äì45. Yet seasonally they might leave to find pasture for their herds and flocks. Modern conjecture is that robust feuding between neighborhood clans kept Berber political organization from rising above the village level, yet the military threat from the city-state of Carthage would inspire Berber villages to join together in order to marshall large-scale armed forces under a strong leader. Social techniques from the nearby polity of Carthage were adopted and modified for Berber use. A bilingual (Punic and Berber) urban inscription of the 2nd century BC from Berber Numidia, specifically from the city of Thugga (modern Dougga, Tunisia), indicates a complex city administration, with the Berber title GLD (corresponding to modern Berber Aguellid, or paramount tribal chief) being the ruling municipal office of the city government; this office apparently rotated among the members of leading Berber families. Circa 220 BC, in the early light given us by historical accounts, three large kingdoms had arisen among the Berbers of Northwest Africa (west to east): (1) the Mauri (in modern Morocco) under king Baga; (2) the Masaesyli (in northern Algeria) under Syphax who ruled from two capitals, Siga (near modern Oran) and to the east Cirta (modern Constantine); and (3) the Massyli (south of Cirta, west and south of Carthage) ruled by Gala, father of Masinissa. Later Masinissa would receive full honors befitting an important leader from both Roman and Hellenic states. Berber ethnic identities were maintained during the long periods of dominance by Carthage and Rome. During the first centuries of the Islamic era, it was said that the Berber tribes were divided into two blocs, the Butr (Zanata and allies) and the Baranis (Sanhaja, Masmuda, and others). The etymology of these names is unclear, perhaps deriving from tribal customs for clothing (\\"abtar\\" and \\"burnous\\"), or perhaps distinguishing the nomad (Butr) from the farmer (Baranis). The Arabs drew most of their early recruits from the Butr.Singular of Baranis is Burnus, from which burnous, understood as a long garment. \\"Abtar\\" signifies cut short, hence a short tunic. Brent and Fentress, The Berbers (1996) pp. 131. E.F.Gautier is cited for his conjecture regarding farmers and nomads. Later, legends arose of an obscure, ancient invasion of Northwest Africa by the Himyarite Arabs of Yemen, from which a prehistoric ancestry was evidently fabricated: Berber descent from two brothers, Burnus and Abtar, who were sons of Barr, the grandson of Canaan (Canaan being the grandson of Noah through his son Ham).Genesis, in 10:1 & 6\\\\. The Hebrew Bible apparently does not list Barr as a descendant of Ham. Chapter 10 of Genesis is known as The Table of Nations. Both Ibn Khaldun (1332‚Äì1406) and Ibn Hazm (994‚Äì1064) as well as Berber genealogists held that the Himyarite Arab ancestry was totally unacceptable.H.T.Norris, Saharan Myth and Saga (Oxford Univ. 1972) pp. 26, 30, citing Ren√© Basset (1900 & 1901). Yet Norris also notes that E.F.Gautier (1942) found an echo in the 6th century Byzantine historian Procopius of the Himyarite myth, and conjectured an ancient Canaanite V√∂lkerwanderungen, finding common cultural symbols. Ibid. p. 30. This legendary ancestry, however, played a role in the long Arabization process that. continued for centuries among the Berber peoples.See below, section Berber Role per the Umayyad Conquest of Ifriqiya. In their medieval Islamic history the Berbers may be divided into three major tribal groups: the Zanata, the Sanhaja, and the Masmuda.The tribal divisions are taken from Ibn Khaldun (1332‚Äì1406). Abun-Nasr remarks that \\"[T]hese divisions do not seem to coincide entirely either with the ethnic groupings or distinctions of dialect.\\" Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 8. The Zanata early on allied more closely with the Arabs and consequently became more Arabized, although Znatiya Berber is still spoken in small islands across Algeria and in northern Morocco (the Rif and north Middle Atlas). The Sanhaja are also widely dispersed throughout the Maghrib, among which are: the sedentary Kabyle on the coast west of modern Algiers, the nomadic Zanaga of southern Morocco (the south Anti-Atlas) and the western Sahara to Senegal, and the Tuareg (al- Tawarik), the well-known camel breeding nomads of the central Sahara. The descendants of the Masmuda are sedentary Berbers of Morocco, in the High Atlas, and from Rabat inland to Azru and Khanifra, the most populous of the modern Berber regions.For Masmuda descendant population, cf., Grimes (ed.), Ethnologue (12th ed. 1992) p. 307.Generally, Jamil M. Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (Cambridge Univ. 1971) pp. 8‚Äì9. Medieval events in Ifriqiya and al-Maghrib often have tribal associations. Linked to the Kabyle Sanhaja were the Kutama tribes, whose support helped to establish the Fatimid Caliphate (909‚Äì1171, only until 1049 in Ifriqiya); their vassals and later successors in Ifriqiya the Zirids (973‚Äì1160) were also Sanhaja.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) p. 34 (Fatamid), 36 (Zirid). The Almoravids (1056‚Äì1147) first began far south of Morocco, among the Lamtuna Sanhaja. From the Masmuda came Ibn Tumart and the Almohad movement (1130‚Äì1269), later supported by the Sanhaja. Accordingly, it was from among the Masmuda that the Hafsid dynasty (1227‚Äì1574) of Tunis originated.H. Mones, \\"The conquest of North Africa and Berber resistance\\" pp. 118‚Äì129, 118‚Äì120, in General History of Africa, Volume III, Africa from the Seventh to the Eleventh Century (UNESCO 1992). =Migrating peoples= The historical era opens with the advent of traders coming by sea from the eastern Mediterranean. Eventually they were followed by a stream of colonists, landing and settling along the coasts of Africa and Iberia, and on the islands of the western seas. Technological innovations and economic development in the eastern Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, and along the Nile, increased the demand for various metals not found locally in sufficient quantity. Phoenician traders recognized the relative abundance and low cost of the needed metals among the goods offered for trade by local merchants in Hispania, which spurred trade.Cf., B.H.Warmington, \\"The Carthaginian period\\" pp. 246‚Äì247, in General History of Africa, vol. II (UNESCO 1990). In the Phoenician city-state of Tyre, much of this Mediterranean commerce, as well as the corresponding trading settlements located at coastal stops along the way to the west, were directed by the kings, e.g., Hiram of Tyre (969‚Äì936).Yuri B. Tsirkin, \\"Phoenician and Greek Colonization\\" pp. 347‚Äì365, 351, in Igor M. Diakonoff, editor, Early Antiquity (Univ.of Chicago 1991), translated from Rannyaya Drevnost (Moskva: Nauka 1982, 1989). By three thousand years ago the Levant and Hellas had enjoyed remarkable prosperity, resulting in population growth in excess of their economic base. On the other hand, political instability from time to time caused disruption of normal business and resulted in short- term economic distress. City-states started organizing their youth to migrate in groups to locations where the land was less densely settled. Importantly, the number of colonists coming from Greece was much larger than those coming from Phoenicia.B.H.Warmington, \\"The Carthaginian period\\" pp. 246‚Äì260, 247, in General History of Africa, vol. II (UNESCO 1990), Abr. Ed. To these migrants, lands in the western Mediterranean presented an opportunity and could be reached relatively easily by ship, without marching through foreign territory. Colonists sailed westward following in the wake of their commercial traders. The Greeks arrived later, coming to (what is now) southern France, southern Italy including Sicily, and eastern Libya. Earlier the Phoenicians had settled in (what is now) Sardinia, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Sicily, and Tunisia. In Tunisia the city of Carthage was founded, which would come to rule all the other Phoenician settlements.Cf., Yuri B. Tsirkin, \\"Phoenician and Greek Colonization\\" pp. 347‚Äì365, in Igor M. Diakonoff, editor, Early Antiquity (Univ.of Chicago 1991), translated from Rannyaya Drevnost (Moskva: Nauka 1982, 1989). Tunisia in its history has seen the arrival of many peoples. By three thousand years ago the Levant and Hellas had prospered, resulting in an excess of population for their economic base. Consequently, city-states started organizing their youth to migrate in groups to where land was less densely settled. To these migrants the western Mediterranean presented an opportunity and could be reached relatively easily by ship, without marching through foreign territory. Such colonists sailed westward across the seas, following the lead of their commercial traders. The Greeks arrived later, coming to (what is now) southern France, southern Italy including Sicily, and Libya. Earlier the Phoenicians had settled in (what is now) Sardinia, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Sicily, and of course, Tunisia. Throughout Tunisia's history many peoples have arrived among the Berbers to settle: most recently the French along with many Italians, before them came the Ottoman Turks with their multi- ethnic rule, yet earlier the Arabs who brought their language and the religion of Islam, and its calendar;The Islamic calendar starts on July 16, 622 A.D., an estimated day for Muhammad's flight (Hijra) from Mecca to Medina. Years in this calendar are designated A.H. for Anno Hegira or the Hijri year. Since the Islamic calendar is strictly lunar, it runs about eleven and one-quarter days shorter than a solar year; hence calculation of dates between this lunar and a solar calendar are complicated. The calendar used in this article is a solar calendar, the traditional western calendar, or the Gregorian, with the years dating from an approximate birth date of Jesus, designated either B.C. for Before Christ, or A.D. for Anno Domini. Alternatively the western calendar can be renamed to sanction a secular modernism, a nominal neutrality, or otherwise, the years being called B.C.E. and C.E., for Common Era. For prehistory, the kya (thousands of years ago) notation is more often employed. before them arrived the Byzantines, and the Vandals. Over two thousand years ago came the Romans, whose Empire long governed the region. The Phoenicians founded Carthage close to three thousand years ago. Also came migrations from the Sahel region of Africa. Perhaps eight millennia ago, already there were peoples established among whom the proto-Berbers (coming from the east) mingled, and from whom the Berbers would spring, during an era of their ethno- genesis. The city-state of Carthage and territories under its political or commercial influence, circa 264 B.C. Carthage =Foundation= The city of Carthage (site of its ruins near present-day Tunis) was founded by Phoenicians coming from the eastern Mediterranean coast. Its name, pronounced Kart Hudesht in their Punic language, meant \\"new city\\".. Here kart meant \\"city\\", hudesht \\"new\\" (pronounced Carchedon in ancient Greek). The Punic idiom is a Canaanite language, in the group of Northwest Semitic languages.Cf. Lancel, Serge (1995) Carthage: A History. Oxford: Blackwell. pp. 351‚Äì360. . Timaeus of Taormina, a third century B.C. Greek historian from Sicily, gives the date of the founding of Carthage as thirty-eight years before the first Olympiad (776 B.C.), which in today's calendar would be the year 814 B.C. Timaeus in Sicily was proximous to Cathaginians and their version of the city's foundation; his date is generally accepted as approximate.Warmington, Carthage (1960) p. 22, noting that the Greek city of Cumae was founded in Italy shortly thereafter. Ancient authors, such as Sallust and Pliny the Elder, give founding dates several hundred years earlier for other Phoenician cities in the western Mediterranean, such as Utica and Gades, but recent archeology has been unable to verify these earlier dates.Lancel, Carthage. A history (1995) pp. 2‚Äì3; 4, 16. It was Tyre, a major maritime city-state of Phoenicia, which first settled Carthage, probably in order to enjoy a permanent station there for its ongoing trade. Legends alive in the African city for centuries assigned its foundation to a queen of Tyre, Elissa, also called Dido.Queen Elissa (Dido) would be related to Jezebel of the Bible. David Soren, Aicha Ben Abed Ben Khader, Hedi Slim, Carthage. Uncovering the Mysteries and Splendors of Ancient Tunisia (New York: Simon & Schuster 1990) pp. 21, 24. Jezebel was the Phoenician wife of Ahab, King of Israel (c.875‚Äì854). The Roman historian Pompeius Trogus, a near contemporary of Virgil, describes a sinister web of court intrigue which caused Queen Elissa (Dido) to flee the city of Tyre westward with a fleet of ships.Soren, Ben Khader, Slim, Carthage (1990) pp. 23‚Äì24. Trogus appears to follow the events as described by the historian Timaeus. The writings of Trogus exist only in a later epitome by Justin. The Roman poet Virgil (70‚Äì19 B.C.) portrays Dido as the tragic, admirable heroine of his epic the Aeneid, which contains many inventions loosely based on legendary history, and includes the story about how the Phoenician queen acquired the Byrsa. =Sovereignty= By the middle of the sixth century B.C., Carthage had grown into a fully independent thalassocracy. Under Mago (r., c.550‚Äì530) and later his Magonid family, Carthage became preeminent among the Phoenician colonies in the western Mediterranean, which included nearby Utica. Hasdrubal of Carthage, younger brother of Hannibal Barca (247‚Äìc.182). Trading partnerships were established among the Numidian Berbers to the west along the African coast as well as to the east in Libya; other stations were located in southern Sardinia and western Sicily, Ibiza in the Balearics, Lixus south of the straits, and Gades north of the straits, with additional trading stations in the south and east of Iberia. Also, Carthage enjoyed an able ally in the Etruscans, who then ruled a powerful state to the north of the infant city of Rome.Gilbert and Colette Picard, Vie et mort de Carthage (1968) translated as Life and Death of Carthage (New York: Taplinger 1969) pp. 59‚Äì72; Glenn Markoe, The Phoenicians (Univ. of California 2000) pp. 54‚Äì56. A merchant sailor of Carthage, Himilco, explored in the Atlantic to the north of the straits, along the coast of the Lusitanians and perhaps as far as Oestrymnis (modern Brittany), circa 500 B.C. Carthage would soon supplant the Iberian city of Tartessus in carrying the tin trade from Oestrymnis. Another, Hanno the Navigator explored the Atlantic to the south, along the African coast well past the River Gambia. The traders of Carthage were known to be secretive about business and particularly about trade routes; it was their practice to keep the straits to the Atlantic closed to the Greeks.Cary and Warmington, The Ancient Explorers (London: Methuen 1929; revised, Baltimore: Pelican 1963) pp. 45‚Äì47 (Himilco), pp. 63‚Äì68 (Hanno), p. 47 (straits closed). The Phoenicians themselves had followed the Minoans in the ancient sea trade, Ibid., pp. 23‚Äì29. In the 530s there had been a three sided naval struggle between the Phoenicians, the Greeks, and the Etrusco-Punic allies; the Greeks lost Corsica to the Etruscans and Sardinia to Carthage. Then the Etruscans attacked Greek colonies in the Campania south of Rome, but unsuccessfully. As an eventual result, Rome threw off their Etruscan kings of the Tarquin dynasty. The Roman Republic and Carthage in 509 entered into a treaty which set out to define their commercial zones.Charles-Picard, The Life and Death of Carthage pp. 72‚Äì78. =Greek rivalry= The energetic presence of Greek traders and their emporia in the Mediterranean region led to disputes over commercial spheres of influence, especially in Sicily. This Greek threat, plus the foreign conquest of Phoenicia in the Levant, had caused many Phoenician colonies to come under the leadership of Carthage. In 480 B.C. (concurrent with Persia's invasion of Greece), Mago's grandson Hamilcar landed a large army in Sicily in order to confront Syracuse (a colony of Corinth) on the island's eastern coast, but the Greeks prevailed at the Battle of Himera. A long struggle ensued with intermittent warfare between Syracuse led by e.g., the tyrant Dionysius I (r.405‚Äì367), and Carthage led by e.g., Hanno I the Great. Later, near Syracuse Punic armies defeated the Greek leader Agathocles (r.317‚Äì289) in battle, who then attempted a bold strategic departure by leaving Sicily and landing his forces at Cape Bon near Carthage, frightening the city. Yet Carthage again defeated Agathocles (310‚Äì307). Greece, preoccupied with its conquest of the Persian Empire in the east, eventually became supplanted in the western Mediterranean by Rome, the new rival of Carthage.Charles-Picard, Life and Death of Carthage pp. 78‚Äì80, 166‚Äì171; Lancel, Carthage: a history pp. 90, 115; Charles-Picard, Life and death of Carthage pp. 131‚Äì134. All this while Carthage enlarged its commercial sphere, venturing south to develop the Saharan trade, augmenting its markets along the African coast, in southern Iberia, and among the Mediterranean islands, and exploring in the far Atlantic. Carthage also established its authority directly among the Numidian Berber peoples in the lands immediately surrounding the city, which grew ever more prosperous.Jamil M. Abun-Naysr, A History of the Maghrib (Cambridge Univ. 1971) pp. 17‚Äì20; Serge Lancel, Carthage: A history (Blackwell 1995) pp. 88‚Äì102; E. W. Bovill, The Golden Trade of the Moors (Oxford 1958, 1968) pp. 18‚Äì28. Tophet funerary stelae, showing (below moon and sun) a symbol of Tanit, queen goddess of Carthage. =Religion of Carthage= The Phoenicians of Tyre brought their lifestyle and inherited customs with them to Northwest Africa. Their religious practices and beliefs were generally similar to those of their neighbors in Canaan, which in turn shared characteristics common throughout the ancient Semitic world.Sabatino Moscati, Ancient Semitic Civilizations (London 1957), e.g., pp. 40 & 113; W. Robertson Smith, Lectures on the Religion of the Semites (London, 3rd ed. 1927). Cf. Julian Baldick, who posits an even greater and more ancient sweep of a common religious culture in his Black God. Afroasiatic roots of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions (1998). Several aspects of Canaanite religion have been widely criticized, particularly temple prostitution and child sacrifice.S.G.F.Brandon (ed.), Dictionary of Comparative Religion (Scribners 1970), \\"Canaanite Religion\\" p. 170, and \\"Molech\\" p. 448. In the foundation story of Abraham and Isaac (Ishmael in Islam), the practice of child sacrifice is shown rejected by Hebrew religion (Genesis 22:1‚Äì19; cf., Leviticus 18:21, 20:2‚Äì5); and temple prostitution is rejected as well per the reforms of Josiah (2 Kings 23:7; cf., Deuteronomy 23:17). Canaanite religious sense and mythology do not appear as elaborated or developed as those of Mesopotamia. In Canaan the supreme god was called El, which means \\"god\\" in common Semitic. The important storm god was called Baal, which means \\"master\\". Other gods were called after royalty, e.g., Melqart means \\"king of the city\\".Moscati, Ancient Semitic Civilizations pp. 113‚Äì114. The gods of the Semitic pantheon that were worshipped would depend on the identity of the particular city-state or tribe.Eshmun the god of healing was the chief god of Sidon, Dagon (whose son was Baal) of Ashdod, the rejuvenating Melqart of Tyre, Terah the moon god of the Zebulon, while in Mesopotamia the moon god was Sin (called Nanna at Ur), the fertility goddess of Uruk being Ishtar, the great. god of Babylon being Marduk. Brandon (ed.), Dictionary of Comparative Religion re \\"Canaanite Religion\\" p. 173, \\"Phoenician Religion\\" p. 501; Richard Carlyon, A Guide to the Gods (New York 1981) pp. 311, 315, 320, 324, 326, 329, 332, 333. After being transplanted to Africa far from its regional origins, and after co-existing with the surrounding Berber tribes, the original Phoenician pantheon and ways of worship evolved distinctly over time at the city-state of Carthage. See also: Religion in Carthage =Constitution of Carthage= The government of Carthage was undoubtedly patterned after the Phoenician, especially the mother city of Tyre, but Phoenician cities had kings and Carthage apparently did not.This discussion first follows Warmington in essence, then turns to Charles-Picard's substantially different results. An important office was called in Punic the Suffets (a Semitic word agnate with the Old Hebrew Shophet usually translated as Judges as in the Book of Judges). Yet the Suffet at Carthage was more the executive leader, but as well served in a judicial role. Birth and wealth were the initial qualifications.A circa 2nd century B.C. bilingual inscription from Thugga (modern Dougga, Tunisia), describes Berber political office holders and indicates some influence by Carthage on Berber state institutions. Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996) p. 39. It appears that the Suffet was elected by the citizens, and held office for a one-year term; probably there were two of them at a time; hence quite comparable to the Roman Consulship. A crucial difference was that the Suffet had no military power. Carthaginian generals marshalled mercenary armies and were separately elected. From about 550 to 450 the Magonid family monopolized the top military position; later the Barcid family acted similarly. Eventually it came to be that, after a war, the commanding general had to testify justifying his actions before a court of 104 judges. Aristotle (384‚Äì322, Greek) discusses Carthage in his Politica describing the city as a \\"mixed constitution\\", a political arrangement with cohabiting elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy.Aristotle, Politica in The Basic Works of Aristotle edited by R. McKeon, translated by B. Jowett (Random House 1941) pp. 1113‚Äì1316, \\"Carthage\\" in Book II, Chapter 11, pp. pages 1171‚Äì1174 (1272b‚Äì1274b). Later Polybus of Megalopolis (c.204‚Äì122, Greek) in his Histories would describe the Roman Republic as a mixed constitution in which the Consuls were the monarchy, the Senate the aristocracy, and the Assemblies the democracy.Polybus, Histories translated as Rise of the Roman Empire (Penguin 19xy) Chapter VI. Evidently Carthage also had an institution of elders who advised the Suffets, similar to the Roman Senate. We do not have a name for this body. At times members would travel with an army general on campaign. Members also formed permanent committees. The institution had several hundred members from the wealthiest class who held office for life. Vacancies were probably filled by co-option. From among its members were selected the 104 Judges mentioned above. Later the 104 would come to judge not only army generals but other office holders as well. Aristotle regarded the 104 as most important; he compared it to the ephorate of Sparta with regard to control over security. In Hannibal's time, such a Judge held office for life. At some stage there also came to be independent self- perpetuating boards of five who filled vacancies and supervised (non-military) government administration.Warmington, Carthage pp. 147‚Äì148. Popular assemblies also existed at Carthage. When deadlocked the Suffets and the quasi-senatorial institution might request the assembly to vote, or in very crucial matters in order to achieve political coherence. The assembly members had no legal wealth or birth qualification. How its members were selected is unknown, e.g., whether by festival group or urban ward or another method.Warmington, Carthage p. 148. The Greeks were favorably impressed by the constitution of Carthage; Aristotle had a study of it made which unfortunately is lost. In the brief approving review of it found in his Politica Aristotle saw one fault: that focus on pursuit of wealth led to oligarchy.Aristotle, Politica in II, 11, pages 1171‚Äì1174 (1272b/23‚Äì1273b/26). So it was in Carthage. The people were politically passive; popular rights came late. Being a commercial republic fielding a mercenary army, the people were not conscripted for military service, an experience which can foster the feel for popular political action. On the other hand, Carthage was very stable; there were few openings for tyrants. \\"The superiority of their constitution is proved by the fact that the common people remain loyal,\\" noted Aristotle.Aristotle, Politica in II, 11, p. page 1171 (1272b/29‚Äì32). Only after defeat by Rome devastated Carthage's imperial ambitions did the people express interest in reform.Warmington, Carthage pp. 143‚Äì144, 148‚Äì150 In 196, following the Second Punic War, Hannibal Barca, still greatly admired as a Barcid military leader, was elected Suffet. When his reforms were blocked by a financial official about to become a Judge for life, Hannibal rallied the populace against the 104 Judges. He proposed a one-year term for the 104, as part of a major civic overhaul. His political opponents cravenly went to Rome and charged Hannibal with conspiracy, with plotting war against Rome in league with Antiochus the Hellenic ruler of Syria. Although Scipio Africanus resisted such maneuver, eventually Roman intervention forced Hannibal to leave Carthage. Thus corrupt officials of Carthage efficiently blocked Hannibal Barca's efforts at reform.Warmington, Carthage pp. 240‚Äì241 The above description of the constitution basically follows Warmington. Largely it is taken from descriptions by Greek foreigners who likely would see in Carthage reflections of their own institutions. How strong was the Hellenizing influence within Carthage? The basic difficulty is the lack of adequate writings due to the secretive nature of the Punic state as well as to the utter destruction of the capital city and its records. Another view of the constitution of Carthage is given by Charles-Picard as follows. Mago (6th century) was King of Carthage, Punic MLK or malik (Greek basileus), not merely a SFT or Suffet, which then was only a minor official. Mago as MLK was head of state and war leader; being MLK was also a religious office. His family was considered to possess a sacred quality. Mago's office was somewhat similar to that of Pharaoh, but although kept in a family it was not hereditary, it was limited by legal consent; however, the council of elders and the popular assembly are late institutions. Carthage was founded by the King of Tyre who had a royal monopoly on this trading venture. Accordingly, royal authority was the traditional source of power the MLK of Carthage possessed. Later, as other Phoenician ship companies entered the trading region, and so associated with the city-state, the MLK of Carthage had to keep order among a rich variety of powerful merchants in their negotiations over risky commerce across the seas. The office of MLK began to be transformed, yet it was not until the aristocrats of Carthage became landowners that a council of elders was institutionalized.Charles-Picard, Life and Death of Carthage pp. 80‚Äì86 =Punic Wars with Rome= The emergence of the Roman Republic and its developing foreign interests led to sustained rivalry with Carthage for dominion of the western Mediterranean. As early as 509 B.C. Carthage and Rome had entered into treaty status, but eventually their opposing positions led to disagreement, alienation, and conflict. Modern engraving of Hannibal Barca, based on marble bust found at Capua, said to have been made during his lifetime. Museo Nazionale, Naples. The First Punic War (264‚Äì241) started in Sicily. It developed into a naval war in which the Romans learned how to fight at sea and prevailed. Carthage lost Sardinia and its western portion of Sicily. Following their defeat, the Mercenary revolt threatened the social order of Carthage, which they survived under their opposing leaders Hanno II the Great, and Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal.Charles-Picard, Life and Death of Carthage pp. 182‚Äì202. The Second Punic War (218‚Äì201) started over a dispute concerning Saguntum (near modern Valencia) in Hispania, from whence Hannibal Barca set out, leading his armies over the Alps into Italy. At first Hannibal (\\"grace of Baal\\") won great military victories against Rome, at Trasimeno (217) and at Cannae (216), which came close to destroying Rome's ability to wage war. Yet the majority of Rome's Italian allies remained loyal; Rome drew on all her resources and managed to rebuild her military strength. For many years Hannibal remained on campaign in southern Italy. An attempt in 207 by his brother Hasdrubal to reinforce him failed. Meanwhile, Roman armies were contesting Carthage for the control of Hispania, in 211 the domain of armies under Hannibal's three brothers (Hasdrubal and Mago), and Hasdrubal Gisco; by 206 the Roman general Cornelius Scipio (later Africanus) had defeated Punic power there. In 204 Rome landed armies at Utica near Carthage, which forced Hannibal's return. One Numidian king, Syphax, supported Carthage. Another, Masinissa, Rome. At the Battle of Zama in 202 the same Roman general Scipio Africanus defeated Hannibal Barca, ending the long war. Carthage lost its trading cities in Hispania and elsewhere in the Western Mediterranean, and much of its influence over the Numidian Kingdoms in Northwest Africa. Carthage became reduced to its immediate surroundings. Also it was required to pay a large indemnity to Rome.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib pp. 25‚Äì28; Lancel, Carthage: a history pp. 376‚Äì401; Charles-Picard, Life and Death of Carthage pp. 230‚Äì267; Theodor Mommsen, Romische Geschichte (3 volumes, Leipzig 1854‚Äì1856) translated by Wm. Dickson as History of Rome (4 volumes 1862, 4th ed. 1894); H. H. Scullard, History of the Roman World, 753‚Äì146 BC (rev.ed. 1951). Cf. the ancient Roman historian Livy, Ab urbe condita (c.20 B.C.) in Books XXI‚ÄìXXX, translated as The War with Hannibal (Penguin 1965). Carthage revived, causing great alarm in Rome. The Third Punic War (149‚Äì146) began following the refusal by Carthage to alter the terms of its agreement with Rome. Roman armies again came to Africa and lay siege to the ancient and magnificent city of Carthage, which rejected negotiations. Eventually, the end came; Carthage was destroyed and its citizens enslaved.Lancel, Carthage: a history pp. 401‚Äì406, 409‚Äì427. Afterward The region (modern Tunisia) was annexed by the Roman Republic as the Province of Africa. Carthage itself was eventually rebuilt by the Romans. Long after the fall of Rome, the city of Carthage would be again destroyed. Roman Province of Africa =Republic and early Empire= The Province (basically what is now Tunisia and coastal regions to the east) became the scene of military campaigns directed by well known Romans during the last decades of the Republic. Gaius Marius celebrated his triumph as a result of successfully finishing Rome's war against Jugurtha, the Numidian king. A wealthy novus homo and populares, Marius was the first Roman general to enlist in his army proletari (landless citizens); he was chosen Consul an unprecedented seven times (107, 104‚Äì100, 86). The optimate Lucius Cornelius Sulla, later Consul (88, 80), and Dictator (82‚Äì79), had served as quaestor under the military command of Marius in Numidia. There in 106 Sulla persuaded Bocchus to hand over Jurgurtha, which ended the war.This conflict was later (circa 40 B.C.) described by the Sallust in his Belum Jugurthinum, translated as The Jugurthine War (Penguin 1964). In 47 B.C. Julius Caesar landed in Africa in pursuit of Pompey's remnant army, which was headquartered at Utica where they enjoyed the support of the Numidian King Juba I. Also present was Cato the Younger, a political leader of Caesar's republican opponents. Caesar's victory nearby at the Battle of Thapsus almost put an end to at phase of the civil war. Cato committed suicide by his sword.H. L. Havel, Republican Rome (London 1914, reprinted 1996) pp. 522‚Äì524; Cato was widely admired. Caesar then annexed Numidia (the eastern region of modern Algeria). Augustus (ruled 31 B.C. to 14 A.D.) controlled the Roman state following the civil war that would mark the end of the Roman Republic. He established a quasi-constitutional regime known as the Principate, later to be called the Roman Empire. Augustus circa 27 B.C. restored Juba II to the throne as King of Mauretania (to the east of the Province of Africa). Educated at Rome and obviously a client king, Juba also wrote books about the culture and history of Africa, and a best seller about Arabia, writings unfortunately lost. He married Cleopatra Selene, the daughter of Anthony and Cleopatra. After his reign, his kingdom and other lands of the Maghrib were annexed as the Roman Provinces of Mauritania Caesaria and Mauritania Tingitana (approximately the western coast of modern Algeria and northern Morocco).Abun-Nasr, History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 31 The Roman Empire, its extent under the emperor Trajan (r. 98‚Äì117), in 117. =Renaissance of Carthage= Rebuilding of the city of Carthage began under Augustus and, notwithstanding reported ill omens, Carthage flourished during the 1st and 2nd centuries. The capital of the Province of Africa, where a Roman praetor or proconsul resided, was soon moved from nearby Utica back to Carthage. Its rich agriculture made the province wealthy; olives and grapes were important products, but by its large exports of wheat. it became famous. Marble, wood, and mules were also important exports. New towns were founded, especially in the Majarda valley near Carthage; many prior Punic and Berber settlements prospered.Jamil M. Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (Cambridge Univ. 1971) p. 35. Expeditions ventured south into the Sahara.

Warmington, The Ancient Explorers (London: Methuen 1929; revised ed., Pelican 1963) pp. 216‚Äì221, 219.

Extensive trade across the Sahara directly with the lands to the south had not yet developed.Richard W. Bulliet, The Camel and the Wheel (Harvard Univ. 1975) pp. 113, 138.A. Bathily, \\"Relations between the different regions of Africa\\" pp. 348‚Äì357, 350, in General History of Africa, volume III, Africa from the Seventh to the Eleventh Century (UNESCO 1992). People from all over the Empire began to migrate into Africa Province, e.g., veterans in early retirement settled in Africa on farming plots promised for their military service. A sizable Latin speaking population at was multinational developed, which shared the region with those speaking the Punic and Berber languages.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1970, 1977) pp. 35‚Äì37.Laroui challenges the accepted view of the prevalence of the Latin language, in his The History of the Maghrib (1977) pp. 45‚Äì46. The local population began eventually to provide the Roman security forces. That the Romans \\"did not display any racial exclusiveness and were remarkably tolerant of Berber religious cults\\" facilitated local acceptance of their rule.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1970, 1977) p. 36. Here the Romans evidently governed well enough that the Province of Africa became integrated into the economy and culture of the Empire, with Carthage as one of its major cities.Soren, Ben Khader, Slim, Carthage (Simon and Schuster 1990) pp. 172‚Äì173, 187 ff. Sketch of Apuleius Apuleius (c.125‚Äìc.185) managed to thrive in the professional and literary communities of Latin-speaking Carthage. A full Berber (Numidian and Gaetulian) of Madaura whose father was a provincial magistrate, he studied at Carthage, and later at Athens (philosophy) and at Rome (oratory), where he evidently served as a legal advocate. He also traveled to Asia Minor and Egypt. Returning to Carthage he married an older, wealthy widow; he then was prosecuted for using magic to gain her affections. His speech in defense makes up his Apology;Apuleius, The Apology and Florida of Apuleius of Madaura (Greenwood Press 1970), translated by Butler. apparently he was acquitted. His celebrated work Metamorphosus, or the Golden Ass is an urbane, extravagant, inventive novel of the ancient world.Apuleius, Golden Ass (Indiana Univ. 1960), translated by Lindsay. The plot unfolds in Greece where the hero, while experimenting with the ointment of a sorceress, is changed not into an eagle but into a donkey. In a digression the tale of Cupid and Psyche is artfully told. After many adventures, the hero regains his human form. One may note the imperial implications of the eagle, and the Northwest African populist image of the donkey. at Carthage he wrote philosophy, rhetoric, and poetry; several statues were erected in his honor.Diana Bowder, editor, Who was Who in the Roman World (Cornell Univ. 1980) p. 27. St. Augustine discusses Apuleius in his The City of God.Augustine, The City of God in Book VIII, Chaps. XIV‚ÄìXXIII (London: J.M.Dent 1967) translated by Healey (1610) as revised by Tasker, in vol. I: 238, 239, 241, 242, 245. Apuleius used a Latin style at registered as \\"New Speech\\" recognized by his literary contemporaries. It expressed the everyday language used by the educated, along with embedded archaisms, which transformed the more formal, classical grammar favored by Cicero (106‚Äì43), and pointed toward the development of modern Romance idioms.Michael Grant, Roman Literature (Cambridge Univ. 1954, reprint Pelican 1958) pp. 118‚Äì122, who discusses his language style and gives with various translated excerpts his \\"novel\\". Apuleius was drawn to the mystery religions, particularly the cult of Isis.Bowder, editor, Who was Who in the Roman World (1980) p. 27. Many native Berbers adopted to the Mediterranean-wide influences operating in the province, eventually intermarrying, or entering into the local aristocracy. Yet the majority did not. There remained a social hierarchy of the Romanized, the partly assimilated, and the unassimilated, many of whom were Berbers. These imperial distinctions overlay the preexisting stratification of economic classes, e.g., there continued the practice of slavery, and there remained a co-opted remnant of the wealthy Punic aristocracy.Soren, Ben Khader, Slim, Carthage (Simon and Schuster 1990) p. 179. Of course, many poor immigrants from other regions of the empire might be considered \\"assimilated\\".Cf., Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) p. 21. The stepped-up pace and economic demands of a cosmopolitan urban life could have a very negative impact on the welfare of the rural poor. Large estates (latifundia) at produced crops for export, often were managed for absentee owners and used slave labor; these occupied lands previously tilled by small local farmers.Cf., Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1970, 1977) p. 35. On another interface, tensions increased between pastoral nomads, who had their herds to graze, and sedentary farmers, with the best land being appropriated for planting, usually by the better-connected. These social divisions would manifest in various ways, e.g., the collateral revolt in 238,Cf., following section Emperors from Africa re the Gordion line. and the radical edge to the Donatist schism.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 19‚Äì23, 21. =Emperors from Africa= Aureus minted in 193: obverse, Septimius Severus; reverse, Legion insignia of XIIII Gemina Martia Victrix. Septimus Severus (145‚Äì211, r.193‚Äì211) was born of mixed Punic Ancestry in Lepcis Magna, Tripolitania (now Libya), where he spent his youth. Although he was said to speak with a Northwest African accent, he and his family were long members of the Roman cosmopolitan elite. His eighteen-year reign was noted for frontier military campaigns. His wife Julia Domna of Emesa, Syria, was from a prominent family of priestly rulers there; as empress in Rome she cultivated a salon which may have included Ulpian of Tyre, the jurist of Roman Law. After Severus (whose reign was well regarded), his son Caracalla (r.211‚Äì217) became Emperor; Caracalla's edict of 212 granted citizenship to all free inhabitants of the Empire. Later, two grand nephews of Severus through his wife Julia Domna became Emperors: Elagabalus (r.218‚Äì222) who brought the black stone of Emesa to Rome; and Severus Alexander (r.222‚Äì235) born in Caesarea sub Libano (Lebanon). Though unrelated, the Emperor Macrinus (r.217‚Äì218) came from Iol Caesarea in Mauretania (modern Sharshal, Algeria).Michael Grant, The Roman Emperors. A biographical guide to the rulers of Imperial Rome, 31 B.C. to A.D. 476 (New York: Scribner's 1985) pp. 108‚Äì113, 117‚Äì136.Diana Bowder (editor), Who was who in the Roman World (Cornell Univ. 1980). There were also Roman Emperors from the Province of Africa. In 238 local proprietors rose in revolt, arming their clients and agricultural tenants who entered Thysdrus (modern El Djem) where they killed their target, a rapacious official and his bodyguards. In open revolt, they then proclaimed as co-emperors the aged Governor of the Province of Africa, Gordian I (c.159‚Äì238), and his son, Gordian II (192‚Äì238). Gordian I had served at Rome in the Senate and as Consul, and had been the Governor of various provinces. The very unpopular current Emperor Maximinus Thrax (who had succeeded the dynasty of Severus) was campaigning on the middle Danube. In Rome the Senate sided with the insurgents of Thysdrus. When the African revolt collapsed under an assault by local forces still loyal to the emperor, the Senate elected two of their number, Balbinus and Pupienus, as co-emperors. Then Maximus Thrax was killed by his disaffected soldiers. Eventually the grandson of Gordian I, Gordian III (225‚Äì244), of the Province of Africa, became the Emperor of the Romans, 238‚Äì244. He died on the Persian frontier. His successor was Philip the Arab.Grant, The Roman Emperors pp. 140‚Äì155.Bowder, editor, Who was Who in the Roman World. =Christianity, its Donatist schism= St. Augustine, by Botticelli (1480). Two significant theologians arose in the Province of Africa. Tertullian (160‚Äì230) was born, lived, and died at Carthage; a convert and a priest, his Latin books were at one time widely known, although he later came to espouse an unforgiving puritanism, after Montanus.Dom Charles Poulet, Histoire de l'Eglise (Paris: Gabriel Beauchesne et ses Fils 1926, 1930), fourth edition edited and translated by Sidney A. Raemers as Church History (St. Louis: B. Herder 1934, 1951) at vol. I, 83‚Äì84, 108‚Äì110.Tilley discusses Tertullian as a predecessor to the Donatists, in her The Bible in Christian North Africa. The Donatist World (Minneapolis: Fortress 1997) pp. 20‚Äì28. St. Augustine (354‚Äì430), Bishop of Hippo (modern Annaba), was born at Tagaste in Numidia (modern Souk Ahras), his mother being St. Monica (who evidently was of Berber heritage).Cf., William M. Green, \\"Augustine's Use of Punic\\" pp. 179‚Äì190, in Semitic and Oriental Studies presented to Prof. Wm. Popper (Univ.of California 1951). At Carthage, Augustine received his higher education. While professor of Rhetoric at Milano (then the Roman imperial capital) he followed Manichaean teachings. Following his conversion from Manichaeism to Christianity he returned to Africa, where he became a church leader and the author of many works. Augustine remains one of the most prominent and most admired of all Christian theologians. His moral philosophy remains influential, e.g., his contribution to the further evolved doctrine of the Just War, used to test whether or not a military action may be considered just and ethical. His books (e.g., The City of God, and Confessions) are still today widely read and discussed.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib pp. 38 & 43‚Äì44, 46.Bowder, editor, Who was who in the Roman World (Cornell Univ. 1980).Cf., Brown, Augustine of Hippo (Univ. of California 1967).Charles Poulet, Church History (1934, 1951), edited and translated by Raemers, in vol. I, 218‚Äì228. The Donatist schism was a major disruption;Named after the Berber Bishop Donatus or Donatus Magnus, there being some confusion. Catholic Encyclopedia: DonatistsConcerning Donatus or Donatus Magnes, compare Tilly, The Bible in Christian North Africa. The Donatist World (Minneapolis: Fortress Press 1997) pp. 61, n18 (194, n18) & 131, with 69‚Äì70. it followed a severe Roman persecution of Christians ordered by the Emperor Diocletian (r.284‚Äì305). An earlier persecution had caused divisions over whether or how to accept back into the church contrite Christians who had apostatized under state threats, abuse, or torture. Then in 313 the new Emperor Constantine by the Edict of Milan had granted tolerance to Christianity, himself becoming a Christian. This turnabout led to confusion in the Church, which in Northwest Africa accentuated the divide between wealthy urban members aligned with the Empire, and the local rural poor whose beliefs included social and political dissidence. Christian Berbers tended to be Donatists, although some more assimilated Berbers were Catholic.Maureen A. Tilley has questioned many traditional assumptions about the Donatists, in her The Bible in Christian North Africa. The Donatist World (Minneapolis: Fortress Press 1997). The Donatists became centered in southern Numidia, the Catholics in Carthage. One issue was whether a priest could perform his spiritual office if not personally worthy. The Donatist schismatics set up parallel churches in order to practice a ritual purity not required by the Catholic Church.It has been commonly remarked that the more rigorous quest for religious purity made by the rural Berbers, when compared to the more relaxed attitude of mainstream civilization, has led not only to Donatism with regard to Christianity, but also as regards Islam to the Berber attraction for the Kharijites, for the Fatimid Ismaili Shia, and for both the Almoravide and the Almohad movements. On another level, one could compare and contrast this Christian schism in Northwest Africa with the Monophysite schism in Coptic Egypt and elsewhere. Augustine the Bishop came to condemn the Donatists throngs for rioting; at one time there were Imperial persecutions. Long negotiations lasted until finally the Catholics declared Donatism a heresy in 405, though general tolerance persisted until the ban became enforced late in the 6th century.Johnson, A History of Christianity (New York: Atheneum 1979) pp. 83‚Äì85, 88, 115.Brown, Augustine of Hippo pp. 215‚Äì225, 240‚Äì241.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib pp. 38‚Äì44, 62. Fall of the Roman Empire in the West =Vandal Kingdom= Migrations of the Vandals in blue (circa 270 to 530) from the Vistula river, southeast into Pannonia, westward to Gaul, south into Hispania, across to Africa and Carthage; raids by sea.Wolfram, The Roman Empire and Its Germanic Peoples (Berlin 1990; Univ.of California 1997) pp. xi‚Äìxiii. In the fifth century the western Roman Empire was in a steep decline. Carthage and the Roman province of Africa were captured in 439 by the Vandals under Gaiseric (r. 428‚Äì477), becoming the center of their Germanic kingdom. The western imperial capital at Ravenna recognized his rule in 442. In 455 the Vandals sailed with an army to the city of Rome, which was occupied without resistance and looted. Yet in governing their kingdom the Vandals did not fully maintain their martial culture, having made alliances with Berber forces upon entering the region.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 45‚Äì47, 50.Herwig Wolfram, Das Reich und die Germanen (Berlin: Wolf Jobst Siedler 1990) translated as The Roman Empire and Its Germanic Peoples (Univ.of California 1997), chap. 7, \\"The Vandals\\" pp. 159‚Äì182, 166‚Äì171. In 429 the Vandals and Alans traveled the 2000 km. from Iulia Traducta in southern Spain to Carthage with about eighty thousand people. Ibid. pp. 163, 166, 169‚Äì170.In 430 St. Augustine died at Hippo Regius while the Vandals besieged the city. Abun-Nasr (1971) p. 46. In religious policy, the Vandals tried to convert the urban Catholic Christians of Africa to their Arian heresy (named after the Egyptian Christian priest Arius, who taught that the Father is greater than the Son and the Spirit), e.g., by sending the clergy into exile and by expropriating churches; in the 520s their efforts turned to persecution, including martyrdom, all without success. The Berbers remained aloof. In all, Vandal rule would last 94 years.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 49‚Äì51.Wolfram, The Roman Empire and Its Germanic Peoples (1990, 1997) pp. 174‚Äì175. The Vandals did provide functional security and governed with a light hand, so that the former Roman province prospered at first. Roman officials and Roman law continued, and Latin was used for government business. Agriculture provided more than enough to feed the region and trade flourished in the towns. Yet because of their desire to maintain a superiority in status, the Vandals refused to intermarry or agreeably assimilate to the advanced culture of the Romans. Consequently, finer points were overlooked; they failed to sustain in its entirety the workable society. The Berbers confederacies beyond the frontier grew increasingly powerful and troublesome.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 48‚Äì49, 52‚Äì53.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 23‚Äì24. =Byzantine Empire= The Eastern Romans or Byzantine Empire eventually recaptured Northwest Africa in 534, under their celebrated general Belisarius. The Byzantines rebuilt fortifications and border defenses (the limes), and entered into treaties with the Berbers. Nevertheless, for many decades security and prosperity were precarious and never fully returned. Direct Byzantine rule didn't extend far beyond the coastal cities; the interior remained under the control of various Berber tribal confederacies. Further west (in modern Algeria) was the Romano- Moor Kingdom of Garmul. Early in the seventh century, several Berber groups (the Jarid and Zanata of the Auruba) converted to Catholicism, although other Berbers remained attached to their gods.It is uncertain how many Berbers professed Christianity, Catholic or Donatist. Cf., H. Mones, \\"The conquest of North Africa and the Berber resistance\\" in General History of Africa (Univ.of California/UNESCO 1992) pp. 119‚Äì120, who opines at only a \\"marginal\\" few (called al-Afarika by Arabs) of Romanized Berbers and Punics, as well as Romans and Greeks, were Christians. In the 540s the restored Catholic Church in Africa was disrupted by the Emperor Justinian's position in favor of the Monophysite doctrine. In the early 600s AD, the Byzantine Empire entered a period of serious crises that would alter the future of Tunisia. For centuries Rome/Byzantium's greatest enemy had been the Sassanid Persians, and the two powers were chronically atwar with each other. The warfare was often intense but usually resulted in small border changes. By the 7th century however, the situation changed dramatically. Persistent religious discord within the Empire, followed by the overthrow of Emperor Maurice by the tyrant Phocas, severely weakened the Byzantines. The Persians invaded the Byzantine Empire, in alliance with the Eurasian Avars and Slavs from the north. Much of the Empire was overrun and it seemed the end was near. It was a son of Carthage, so-to-speak, who managed to play a crucial role in restoring the imperial destiny.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 53‚Äì56, 58, 62‚Äì63.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 24‚Äì26. The son of the Exarch of Carthage, Flavius Heraclius Agustus,M. Chahin (1987) p. 270. sailed east with an African fleet to the Byzantine capital city of Constantinople and overthrew the usurper Phocas; Heraclius became the Byzantine Emperor in 610. He began reorganizing the government and erecting defenses to counter the threats to the capital. Yet the Persians continued their invasion, meeting little resistance, taking Antioch in 611, Jerusalem in 614, and Alexandria in 619, in astonishing victories. His forces soon stood before Constantinople. In response, Heraclius took a great risk and moved an army by ship over the Black Sea, landing near his Armenian allies, and in the fighting managed to out-flank the Persians. By 627 Heraclius was marching on their capital Ctesiphon, a complete reversal of fortune. Then in 628 Chosroes II was killed in a revolt by his generals. Byzantine Empire, 650 A.D., still with its Exarchate of Carthage, yet after its recent loss of Syria (634‚Äì636) and of Egypt (639‚Äì641) to the Arabs. As a result of these dramatic and tumultuous events, Sassanid Persia was in disarray and confusion, and Byzantines soon retook their provinces of Egypt and Syria, but the religious discord between the local Monophysite and Eastern Orthodox Christians returned. Eastern Orthodox Emperor Heraclius (575‚Äì641), the former Exarch of Africa (Carthage), attempted to work out a theological compromise, Monothelitism, but without any success. Yet events did not rest. To the south, Arab Islamic armies began to stir, unified and energized by the teachings of the Prophet, Muhammad (570‚Äì632). In 636 at the Battle of Yarmuk to the east of the Sea of Galilee, the Arabs decisively defeated the Byzantine forces.A. A. Vasiliev, History of the Byzantine Empire (1917, 1923‚Äì25; Univ.of Wisconsin 1928‚Äì29, 1964) in vol. I, 176, 194‚Äì200, 211.Percy Sykes, A History of Persia (London: Macmillan 1915, 1921, 1930, reprinted New York: St. Martin's 1951) in vol. I, pp. 480‚Äì486. Following the Arab invasion of Egypt in 640, Christian refugees came west into the Exarchate of Africa (Carthage). There serious disputes arose within the Catholic churches pp. Carthage over Monophysite doctrines and Monothelitism, with St. Maximus the Confessor leading the orthodox Catholics.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 63‚Äì65. Umayyad Caliphate in Ifriqiya By 661 the Umayyads had taken firm control of the new Muslim state, which it ruled from Damascus. The Caliph Mu'awiya could see the foreign lands west of Egypt in terms of the Muslim contest with the Byzantine Empire. =Islamic conquest= The Age of the early Caliphs In 670 an Arab Muslim army under Uqba ibn Nafi, who had commanded an earlier incursion in 666, entered the region of Ifriqiya (Arabic for the Province of Africa). Arriving by land the Arabs passed by Byzantine fortified positions along the Mediterranean coast. In the more arid south, the city of Kairouan [stronghold in Arabic] was established as their base, and the building of its famous Mosque begun. From 675 to 682 Dinar ibn Abu al-Muhadjir took command of the Arab Muslim army.H. Mones, \\"The Conquest of North Africa and Berber resistance\\" in I. Hrbek (ed.), General History of Africa (Univ.of California/UNESCO 1992) pp. 118‚Äì129, 122‚Äì123. Prof. Mones provides a description of the various Berber tribes of this era, their locations and alliances, pp. 118‚Äì120. In the late 670s, this army defeated the Berber forces (apparently composed of sedentary Christians mainly from the Awreba tribe and perhaps the Sanhadja confederation) led by Kusaila, who was taken prisoner. In 682, Uqba ibn Nafi reassumed command. He defeated an alliance of Berber forces near Tahirt (Algeria), then proceeded westward in military triumph, eventually reaching the Atlantic coast, where he lamented at before him there was no more land to conquer for Islam. Episodes from his campaigns became legend throughout the Maghrib. Yet the Berber leader held prisoner, Kusaila, escaped. Later Kusaila led a fresh Berber uprising, which interrupted the conquest and claimed the Arab leader's life. Kusaila then formed an enlarged Berber kingdom. Yet Zuhair b. Qais, the deputy of the fallen Arab leader, enlisted Zanata tribes from Cyrenaica to fight for the cause of Islam, and in 686 managed to overturn Kusaila's newly formed kingdom.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 67‚Äì69.John K. Cooley, Baal, Christ, and Mohammed (New York 1965) pp. 64‚Äì69.A slightly different view of Kusaila (Kusayla) is given by H. Mones, in his \\"The Conquest of North Africa and Berber resistance\\" in I. Hrbek (ed.), General History of Africa (Univ.of California/UNESCO 1992) pp. 118‚Äì129, 123‚Äì124; Mones relates at Kusayla converted to Islam at first but turned against Islam due to a perceived injustice (Arabs marching against Berber converts). Under the Caliph 'Abd al-Malik (685‚Äì705), the Umayyad conquest of North Africa was to advance close to completion. In Egypt a new army of forty thousand was assembled, to be commanded by Hassan ibn al-Nu'man (known to Arabs as \\"the honest old man\\"). Meanwhile, the Byzantines had been reinforced. The Arab Muslim army crossed the Cyrene and Tripoli without opposition, then quickly attacked and captured Carthage. The Berbers, however, continued to offer stiff resistance, then being led by a woman of the Jarawa tribe, whom the Arabs called the prophetess [\\"al-Kahina\\" in Arabic]; her actual name was approximately \\"Damiya\\".Three citations may be given as follows: Muhammed Talbi, \\"Un nouveau fragment de l'histoire de l'Occident musulman: l'√©pop√©e d'al Kahina\\" in Cahiers de Tunisie 19: 19‚Äì52 (1971);Abdelmajid Hannoum, Post- Colonial Memories. The Legend of Kahina, a North African heroine (2001);Yves Mod√©ran, \\"Kahena\\" in Encyclop√©die Berb√®re 27: 4102‚Äì4111.By a prior interpretation of Ibn Khaldun (1332‚Äì1406), al-Kahina was seen as Jewish; yet this is now being understood as a misreading of his text. Contra: Andr√© Chouraqui presents Kahina as Jewish in his Les Juifs d'Afrique du Nord. Entre l'Orient et l'Occident (Paris: Foundation Nat. de Sciences Politiques 1965), translated as Between East and West. A History of the Jews of North Africa (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society 1968; reprint New York: Atheneum 1973) pp. 34‚Äì37. \\"[T]he warrior-priestess Kahena... was the chief of the Jewara tribe.\\" \\"Later historians [were] unanimous in regarding them as Jews.\\" Chouraqui cites Ibn Khaldun, other and modern authors. Ibid. and notes 2‚Äì10 (pp. 328‚Äì329). On the river Nini, an alliance of Berbers under Damiya defeated the Muslim armies under al-Nu'man, who escaped returning to Cyrenaica. Thereupon, the Byzantines took advantage of the Berber victory by reoccupying Carthage. Unlike the Berber Kusaila ten years earlier, Damiya did not establish a larger state, evidently being content to rule merely her own tribe. Some commentators speculate as to Damiya the Arabs appeared interested in booty primarily, because she then commenced to ravage and disrupt the region, making it unattractive to raiders looking for spoils of war; of course, it also made her unpopular to the residents. Yet she did not attack the Muslim base at Kairouan. From Egypt the Caliph 'Abdul-Malik had reinforced al-Nu'man in 698, who then reentered Ifriqiya. Although she told her two sons to go over to the Arabs, she herself again gave battle. She lost;al-Nu'man won. It is said at Bir al-Kahina [well of the prophetess] in the Auras, Damiya was killed.Brett & Fentress, The Berbers (1996) p. 85.Cooley, Baal, Christ, and Mohammed (1965) pp. 69‚Äì72.Welch, North African Prelude (1949) pp. 189‚Äì194.Chouraqui, Between East and West. A History of the Jews of North Africa (Atheneum 1973) pp. 34‚Äì37. In 705 Hassan b.al-Nu'man stormed Carthage, overcame and sacked it, leaving it destroyed. A similar fate befell the city of Utica. Near the ruins of Carthage he founded Tunis as a naval base. Muslim ships began to dominate the Mediterranean coast; hence the Byzantines made their final withdrawal from al-Maghrib. Then al-Nu'man was replaced as Muslim military leader by Musa ibn Nusair, who substantially completed the conquest of al-Maghrib. He soon took the city of Tangier and appointed as its governor the Berber Tariq ibn Ziyad.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 69‚Äì70. =Berber role= The Berber people, also known as the Amazigh, \\"converted en mass as tribes and assimilated juridically to the Arabs,\\" writes Prof. Hodgson; he then comments that the Berbers were to play a r√¥le in the west parallel to at played by the Arabs elsewhere in Islam. For centuries the Berbers lived as semi-pastoralists in or near arid lands at the fringes of civilization, sustaining their isolated identity somewhat. like the Arabs. \\"The Maghrib, islanded between Mediterranean and Sahara, was to the Berbers what Arabia... was to the Arabs.\\" Hodgson explains: although the Berbers enjoyed more rainfall than the Arabs, their higher mountains made their settlements likewise difficult to access; and though the Imperial cities were more proximous, those cities never incorporated the countryside with a network of market towns, but instead remained aloof from the indigenous rural Berbers. Masinissa, King of Numidia (circa 238‚Äì145) A counter argument would be that the Berbers merely imitated the success of the Arab Muslims; the better historical choice would be more uniquely ethnic and authentic, i.e., to articulate their own inner character and fate.Cf., Abdallah Laroui, L'Histoire du Maghreb (Paris 1970), translated by Ralph Manheim as The History of the Maghrib (Princeton Univ. 1977) pp. 98‚Äì101, who distills this argument from modern French academics, e.g., Stephane Gsell, Charles-Andres Julien, and Gabriel Camps. Laroui presents this argument, then mocks it and penetrates it, taking the discussion through various points of view: positive, negative, neutral, other. \\"If a Maghribi were to rewrite the history of France and England from the point of view of the Celts, stressing their negativity and inauthenticity... .\\" Laroui, Ibid., p. 101.Perkins pointedly discusses the seeming preference of earlier French historians for the Berbers over the Arabs because it was considered at a Berber ascendancy was good for French interests. Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) p. 54, n1 (to text at 41), discussing the Arab Bani Hilal. Prof. Abdallah Laroui interprets the Northwest African panorama as indicating that the Berbers did in fact carve out for themselves an independent r√¥le. \\"From the first century B.C. to the eighth century A.D. the will of the Berbers to be themselves is revealed by the continuity of their efforts to reconstitute the kingdoms of the Carthaginian period, and in this sense the movement was crowned with success.\\"Laroui, The History of the Maghrib p. 100. By choosing to ally not with nearby Europe, familiar in memory by the Roman past,Although then it was the Byzantines who were rivals of the Arabs, both foreign powers coming from the east. Yet, of course, the Byzantines shared with the Romans their civil traditions and the Christian religion. but rather with the newcomers from distant Arabia, the Berbers knowingly decided their future and historical path. \\"Their hearts opened to the call of Islam because in it they saw a means of national liberation and territorial independence.\\", cited by Laroui (1970, 1977) pp. 101, n.19. Environmental and geographic parallels between Berber and Arab are notable, as Hodgeson adumbrates. In addition, the languages spoken by the semitic Arabs and by the BerbersSee above, \\"Early History\\" section. are both members of the same world language family, the Afro-Asiatic, although from two of its different branches.Joseph Greenberg, The Languages of Africa (Indiana Univ. 1966) pp. 42, 50.David Crystal, Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language (1987) p. 316.I. M. Diakonoff, Semito- Hamitic Languages (Moscow: Nauka Publishing House 1965). Perhaps this linguistic kinship shares a further resonance, e.g., in mythic explanations, popular symbols, and religious preference.As to such possible linkages, cf. Julian Baldick, Black God. Afro-Asiatic roots of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions (1998).Cf., H.T.Norris, Saharan Myth and Saga (Oxford Univ. 1972).Cf., Moorish Literature, introduction by Ren√© Basset (New York: Collier 1901). Evidently, long before and after the Islamic conquest, there was some popular sense of a strong and long-standing cultural connection between the BerbersSee above, Early History section. and the Semites of the Levant, naturally with regard to CarthageThe Phoenicians of Tyre who founded and settled in Carthage spoke and wrote in a Canaanite language, a division of Northwest Semitic, called Punic (Lancel, Carthage: a history (1995) pp. 351‚Äì360), and transplanted their culture to Africa.See above Carthage section. and in addition with regard to links yet more ancient and genetic.Chouraqui, Between East and West (1952, 1968) pp. 3‚Äì5, who cites a variety of sources, e.g., Flavius Josephus (37‚Äìc.100), Antiquities of the Jews I:15 (at the Libyans were invaded by Ophren, grandson of Moses, whose descendants multiplied in Africa); Tacitus (56‚Äìc.117), Annals V,2 (at the Jews were originally Libyans, i.e., Berbers); St. Augustine (354‚Äì430), Epistolae ad Romanos Inchoata Exposition 13 (P.L. 34, 2096), who reported a widespread belief by local Berbers (or mixed Punic-Berbers) of their Canaanite origins; Ibn Khaldun (1332‚Äì1406), Histoire des Berberes, as translated by Slane (Algiers 1852‚Äì1856) p. 177, who stated that the Berbers are descendants of Canaan, yet which he contradicts later, p. 183; and a pilgrimage site at Nedromah (near Tlemcen, Algeria), believed to be the tomb of Joshua the biblical conqueror, successor to Moses. These claims of a remote ancestral relationship perhaps facilitated the Berber demand for equal footing with the Arab invaders within the religion of Islam following the conquest.Cf., H. Mones, \\"The conquest of North Africa and the Berber resistance\\" pp. 118‚Äì129, 128‚Äì129, in General History of Africa, volume III, edited by I. Hrbek (Univ.of California/UNESCO 1992). From Cyrenaica to al-Andalus, the somewhat Arabized Berbers continuously remained in communication with each other throughout the following centuries. As a group their distinguishing features are easy to discern within Islam; e.g., while the ulama in the rest of Islam adopted for the most part either the Hanafi or the Shafi'i school of law, the Berbers in the west chose the Maliki madhhab, developing it in the course of time after their own fashion.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib p. 71.Marshall G. S. Hodgson, The Venture of Islam, im volume I: 226, and 308‚Äì312. Also inducing the Berbers to convert was the early lack of rigor in religious obligations, as well as the prospect of inclusion as warriors in the armies of conquest, with a corresponding share in booty and tribute. A few years later, in 711, the Berber Tariq ibn Ziyad would lead the Muslim invasion of the Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania. Additionally, many of the Arabs who came to settle in al- Maghrib were religious and political dissidents, often Kharijites who opposed the Umayyad rulers in Damascus and embraced egalitarian doctrines, both popular positions among the Berbers of Northwest Africa.H. Mones, \\"The Conquest of North Africa and Berber resistance\\" in I. Hrbek (ed.), General History of Africa (Univ. of California/UNESCO 1992) pp. 118‚Äì129, 127‚Äì129. The Berbers particularly resented Arab ethnic discrimination against Berber converts to Islam. Also, to locate its historical and religious context, the Arab conquest and Berber conversion to Islam followed a long period of polarization of society in the old province of Africa, in which the Donatist schism within Christianity proved instrumental, with the rural Berbers prominent in their dissent from the urban orthodoxy of the Roman church.Cf., Laoui, The History of the Maghrib (1977) pp. 54‚Äì57. See above, Roman Province of Africa, per Christianity, its Donatist schism. Too, the Vandals (see above, Vandal Kingdom) also religiously polarized the society by the forcing on the urban centers their Arian Christianity (which did parallel at least to some extent Islamic theology about the r√¥le of Jesus). The Berbers were initially attracted to the Arabs because of their \\"proclivity for the desert and the steppes\\".Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 29‚Äì30.Cf., Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 65‚Äì66. After the conquest and following the popular conversion, Ifriqiya constituted a natural and proximous center for an Arab-Islamic regime in Northwest Africa, the focus of culture and society. It was then the region with the most developed urban, commercial and agricultural infrastructure, essential for such a comprehensive project as Islam. Aghlabid Dynasty under the Abbasids During the years immediately preceding the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate of Damascus (661‚Äì750),One of the few surviving members of the Umayyad family, Abd-ar-Rahman I fled Syria as a fugitive, made his way west, hiding for a time in a Berber camp near Ifriqiya; later, he became the Emir of Cordoba (756‚Äì786) and founder of another Umayyad dynasty there in al-Andalus(756‚Äì1031). Richard Fletcher, Moorish Spain (New York: Henry Holt 1992) pp. 28. revolts arose among the Kharijite Berbers in Morocco which eventually disrupted the stability of the entire Maghrib. Although the Kharijites failed to establish lasting institutions, the results of their revolt persisted. Direct rule by the Caliphs over Ifriqiya became untenable, even following the rapid establishment of the new Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad in 750. Also, after several generations a local Arabic-speaking aristocracy emerged, which became resentful of the distant caliphate's interference in local matters.Especially after the rise of the Persianizing 'Abbasids and the move of the capital further to the east, to Baghdad. =Political culture= Aghlabid Dynasty at its greatest extent, which also included Sicily & some of southern Italy. The Muhallabids (771‚Äì793) negotiated with the 'Abbasids a wide discretion in the exercise of their governorship of Ifriqiya. One such governor was al-Aghlab ibn Salim (r. 765‚Äì767), a forefather of the Aghlabids. Eventually Muhallabid rule weakened: a minor rebellion in Tunis took on a more ominous turn when it spread to Kairouan. The Caliph's governor was unable to restore order. Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab, a provincial leader (and son of al-Aghlab ibn Salim), was in command of a disciplined army; he managed to reestablish stability in 797. Later he proposed to the 'Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, that he be granted Ifriqiya (as the Arabs called the former Province of Africa) as a hereditary fief, with the title of amir; the caliph acquiesced in 800.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (Boulder: Westview 1986) p. 30. Thereafter, the 'Abbasids received an annual tribute and their suzerainty was named in the khutba at Friday prayers,Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1977) p. 116. but their control was largely symbolic, e.g., in 864 the Caliph al-Mu'tasim \\"required\\" at a new wing be added to the Zaytuna Mosque in Tunis.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 77. From 800 to 909, Ibrahim ibn-al-Aghlab (800‚Äì812) and his descendants, known as the Aghlabids, ruled in Ifriqiya, as well as in Algeria (to the west) and in Tripolitania (to the east), yet in theory their rule was on behalf of the 'Abbasid Caliphate. The Aghlabids were predominantly of an Arab tribe the Bani Tamim. Their military forces were drawn from: (a) Arab immigrant warriors (those recently sent against the Kharajite revolts, and descendants of earlier Arab invasions), (b) Islamized and bilingual natives (Afariq), and (c) black slave soldiers. It was on their black soldiery that the rulers often relied.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1977) p. 118.Julien defines Afariq as Christians of Ifriqiya, including Berbers and Romans. Charles-Andr√© Julien, Histoire de L'Afrique du Nord (Paris: Payor 1931; revised by de Tourneau 1952), translated as History of North Africa (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul 1970; New York: Praeger 1970) p. 43. Despite the political peace and stability, followed by an economic expansion and prosperity, and despite a developing culture and grand construction projects, many in the Arabic-speaking elite developed an increasingly critical attitude toward the Aghlabid regime. First, the Arab military officer class was dissatisfied with the legitimacy of the regime and often fell to internal quarreling which could spill over into violent struggles. Their latent hostility surfaced when they began making extortionist demands on the population, as well as by their general insubordination. A dangerous revolt from within the Arab army (the jund) broke out near Tunis and lasted from 824 until 826. The Aghlabids retreated to the south and were saved only by enlisting the aid of Berbers of the Kharajite Jarid. (Another revolt of 893, provoked by the cruelty of the ninth Aghlabid amir, Ibrahim II Ibn Ahmad (r. 875‚Äì902), was put down by the black soldiery.) Second, the Muslim ulema looked with reproach on the ruling Aghlabids. Aggravation in religious circles arose primarily from the un-Islamic lifestyle of the rulers. Disregarding the strong religious sentiments held by the many in the community, often the Aghlabids led lives of pleasure and, e.g., were seen drinking wine (against Islamic law). Another issue was Aghlabid taxation not sanctioned by the Maliki school of Islamic law. Other opponents criticized their contemptuous treatment of mawali Berbers who had embraced Islam. The Islamic doctrine of equality regardless of race was a cornerstone of the Sunni movement in the Maghrib, and also of the Maliki school of law as developed in Kairouan; these principles formed the core of the hostility of Ifriqiya toward rule from the east by the Caliph.Cf., Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 30‚Äì31. As recompense, the Aghlabid rulers saw at mosques were constructed or augmented, e.g., at Tunis (the Olive Tree [Zaituna] Mosque, as well as its famous university, Ez-Zitouna); at. Kairouan (Mosque of the Three Doors), and at Sfax. Also a well known ribat or fortified monastery was built at Monastir, and at Susa (in 821 by Ziyadat Allah I); here Islamic warriors trained. In 831 the son of Ibrahim, Ziyadat Allah I (r. 817‚Äì838), launched an invasion of Sicily. Placed in command was Asad ibn-al-Furat, the qadi or religious judge; the military adventure was termed a jihad.Kenneth J. Perkins, Tunisia. Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (Boulder: Westview Press 1986) pp. 31‚Äì32. This expedition proved successful; Palermo was made the capitol of the region captured. Later raids were made against the Italian peninsula; in 846 Rome was attacked and the Basilica of St. Peter sacked. In orchestrating the invasion of Sicily, the Aghlabid rulers had managed to unite two rebellious factions (the army and the clergy) in a common effort against outsiders.Charles-Andr√© Julien, History of North Africa (1931, 1952, 1970) pp. 49‚Äì50. The observer may recognize this social pattern as being all too common among human societies no matter the time nor the place. Later Islamic rulers in Sicily severed connections with Ifriqiyah, and their own Sicilian Kalbid dynasty (948‚Äì1053) governed the Emirate.In 1061 the Normans under Roger I of Sicily arrived on the island and eventually brought it under their rule. Charles Homer Haskins, The Normans in European History (Houghton Mifflin 1915, reprint Norton 1966) pp. 208‚Äì211. The invasion of Sicily had worked to stabilize the political order in Ifriqiya, which progressed in relative tranquility during its middle period. In its final decline, however, the dynasty self-destructed, when its eleventh and last amir, Ziyadat Allah III (r. 902‚Äì909) (d. 916), due to insecurity stemming from his father's assassination, ordered his rival brothers and uncles executed. This occurred during the assaults made by the Fatimids against the Aghlabid domains.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) p. 33. =Institutions and Society= In the Aghlabid government generally, the high positions were filled by \\"princes of the blood, whose loyalty could be relied on.\\" The judicial post of Qadi of Kairouan was said to be given \\"only to outstanding personalities notable for their conscientiousness even more than their knowledge.\\" On the other hand, the administrative staffs were composed of dependent clients (mostly recent Arab and Persian immigrants), and the local bilingual Afariq (mostly Berber, and which included many Christians). The Islamic state in Ifriqiya paralleled in many respects the government structure formed in Abbasid Baghdad,In turn, the 'Abbasids owed much to antecedent Sasanian Persian institutions. There was the vizier [prime minister], the hajib [chamberlain], the sahib al-barid [master of posts and intelligence], and numerous kuttab [secretaries] (e.g., of taxation, of the mint, of the army, of correspondence). Leading Jews formed a small elite group. As in an earlier periods (e.g., under Byzantine rule), the majority of the population consisted of rural Berbers, distrusted now because of Kharajite or similar tendencies.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1977) p. 117. Kairouan (or Qayrawan) had become the cultural center of not only of Ifriqiya but of the entire Maghrib. A type of volume then current, the tabaqat (concerning the handling of documents), indirectly illuminates elite life in Aghlabid Ifriqiya. One such work was the Tabaqat 'ulama' Ifriqiya [Classes of Scholars of Ifriqiya] written by Abu al-'Arab.Muhammad Ben Cheneb (ed. & transl.), Classes des savants de l'Ifriqiya (Alger: Publications de la Faculte de lettres d'Alger 1914‚Äì1920), cited by Julien (1970) pp. 43 n.12 and 75.Cf. Laroui (1977) p. 119 n.19. Among the Sunni Muslim ulema, two learned professions then came to the fore: (a) the faqih (plural fuqaha) or the jurist; and (b) the 'ƒÅbid or the ascetics. Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i, and Hanbali schools of law: their core areas. The fuqaha congregated at Kairouan, then the legal center of al-Maghrib.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 30‚Äì31. The more liberal Hanafi school of law at first predominated in Ifriqiyah, but soon a strict form of the Maliki school came to prevail, becoming in fact the only widespread madhhab, not only in Tunisia but throughout Northwest Africa, a situation which continues (despite several interruptions) to be the norm today. The Maliki school was introduced to Ifriqiya by the jurist Asad ibn al-Furat, (759‚Äì829), who nonetheless wavered between these two schools of law. The Mudawanna, written by his disciple Sahnun ('Abd al-Salam b. Sa'id) (776‚Äì854), provided a \\"vulgate of North-African Malikism\\" during the period in which this madhhab won the field against its rival, the Hanafi.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1977) pp. 120‚Äì121. Laroui suggests that the Ifriqiya victory by the Maliki partisans was aided by linking the Hanafi school to the rationalist doctrines of the Mu'tazili, which later became discredited. Ibid. p. 120. Abu Hanifa (700‚Äì767) drew out fiqh at was perhaps better suited to its origin in Baghdad, the sophisticated imperial capital; Malik ibn Anas (716‚Äì795) initiated the school bearing his name in Medina.Knut S. Vikor, Between God and the Sultan. A History of Islamic Law (Oxford Univ. 2005) pp. 94‚Äì100.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1977) p. 120. By choosing the Maliki school, Ifriqiya obtained more discretion in defining its legal culture. The Maliki jurists were often at odds with the Aghlabids, e.g., over their personal immorality, and over issues of taxation regarding agriculture (i.e., of a fixed cash levy instead of a tithe in kind).The offending tax on crops payable in cash being the act of the second amir, 'Abdullah ibn Ibrahim (812‚Äì817). Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 77. Also the Maliki fuqaha was understood to act in the interests of the Berbers for a local autonomy, by filtering out potential intrusions into Ifriqiya by Arab power and influence from the east.Julien, History of North Africa (1931, 1952, 1970) pp. 45‚Äì46. Foremost of the 'ƒÅbid scholars or ascetics was Buhlul b. Rashid (d. 799), who reputedly despised money and refused the post of grand judge; his fame spread throughout the Islamic world. By virtue of their piety and independence, the abid won social prestige and a voice in politics, speaking especially for the cities, criticizing the regime's finance and trade decisions.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1977) p. 121. Although substantially different, the status of the 'ƒÅbid relates somewhat to the much later figure of the Maghribi saint, the wali, who as keeper of baraka (spiritual charisma) became the object of veneration by religious believers, and whose tomb would be the destination of pilgrimage.Julien, History of North Africa (1952, 1970) pp. 43, 338. Ifriqiya flourished under Aghlabid rule. Extensive improvements were made to the pre- existing water works in order to promote olive groves and other agriculture (oils and cereals were exported), to irrigate the royal gardens, and for livestock. Roman aqueducts to supply the towns with water were rebuilt under Abu Ibrahim Ahmad, the sixth amir. In the Kairouan region hundreds of basins were constructed to store water for the raising of horses.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1977) pp. 121‚Äì125. Commercial trade resumed under the new Islamic regime, e.g., by sea, particularly to the east with the Egyptian port of Alexandria. Also, improved trade routes linked Ifriqiya with the continental interior, the Sahara and the Sudan, regions regularly incorporated into the Mediterranean commerce for the first time during this period. Evidently camels on a large scale had not been common to the region until the fourth century, and it was not until several centuries later at their use in the Saharan trade became generally recognized. The trade began in earnest. The desert city of Sijilmasa near the Atlas mountains in the far west [maghrib al- aqsa] served as one of the primary trading junctions and entrep√¥ts, e.g., for salt and gold. Yet Wargla was the primary desert link to Gafsa and Kairouan. Also Ghadames, Ghat, and Tuat served the Saharan trade to Ifriqiya.E. W. Bovill, The Golden Trade of the Moors (Oxford Univ. 1958, 1968) pp. 68‚Äì74, 87, 239. A prosperous economy permitted a refined and luxurious court life and the construction of the new palace cities of al-'Abbasiya (809), and Raqada (877) for the residences of the ruling amir. The architecture was later imitated in Fez, Tlemcen, and Bougie. The location of these Aghlabid government centers was outside of Kairouan, a city dominated by Muslim clerical institutions. Ifriqiyah during the era under the Aghlabid Dynasty (799‚Äì909) for the most part continued its leading r√¥le in the Maghrib, due generally to its peace and stability, recognized cultural achievements, and material prosperity.Abdallah Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (Paris 1970, Princeton Univ. 1977) pp. 115‚Äì121Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 76‚Äì78.Charles-Andr√© Julien, Histoire de L'Afrique du Nord (Paris: Payor 1931; revised by de Tourneau 1952), translated as History of North Africa (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul 1970; New York: Praeger 1970) pp. 41‚Äì50. Fatimids: Shi'a Caliphate, and the Zirids As the Fatimids grew in strength and numbers nearby to the west, they began to launch frequent attacks on the Aghlabid regime in Ifriqiya, which of course contributed to its political instability and general unrest.Ifriqiya continued to endure strife between the orthodox Sunnis of the Malikite madhhab, and the remnants of the Kharijite Berbers to south and east. I. Hrbek, \\"The emergence of the Fatimids\\" in General History of Africa, volume III, p. 163 (Paris: UNESCO; Berkeley: Univ.of California 1992, abridged edition). The Fatimids eventually managed to capture Kairouan in 909, forcing the last of the Aghlabid line, Ziyadat Allah III, to evacuate the palace at Raqadda. On the east coast of Ifriqiaya facing Egypt, the Fatimids built a new capital on top of ancient ruins, calling the seaport Mahdiya after their mahdi.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1977) pp. 130‚Äì132. =Maghribi Origin of the Fatimids= The Fatimid movement had originated locally in al-Maghrib, among the Kotama Berbers in Kabylia (Setif, south of Bougie, eastern Algeria). However, both founders of the movement were recent immigrants from the Islamic east, religious dissidents: Abu 'Abdulla ash-Shi'i, originally from San'a in al-Yemen; and, coming from Salamiyah in Syria, 'Ubaidalla Sa'id (who claimed descent from Fatima the daughter of the prophet Muhammad, and who was to proclaim himself the Fatimid Mahdi). Their religious affiliation was the Ismaili branch of the Shia. By agreement, the first founder to arrive (circa 893) was Abu 'Abdulla, the Ismaili Da'i or propagandist, who found welcome in the hostility against the Caliphate in Baghdad freely expressed by the Kotama Berbers.Glasse, The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam re \\"Fatimid\\" pp. 123‚Äì125, remarks on the pre-Islamic Berber connections to Gnostic doctrines, and to Manichaean leadership near Baghdad, as further reasons for their resonance with the Ismaili Da'i, p. 124. After his success in recruitment and in building the organization, Abu 'Abdulla was ready in 902 to send for 'Ubaidalla Sa'ed, who (after adventures and imprisonment) arrived in 910, proclaimed himself Mahdi, and took control of the movement. Abu 'Abdulla was killed in a dispute over leadership.Abun- Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 80‚Äì81. The Fatimid Empire (909‚Äì1171) at its greatest extent. From the start the Mahdi was focused on expansion eastward, and he soon attacked Egypt with a Fatimid army of Kotama Berbers led by his son, once in 914, and again in 919, both times quickly taking Alexandria but then losing to the Abbasids. Probing for weakness, the Mahdi then sent an invasion westward, but his forces met with mixed results. Many Sunnis, including the Umayyad Caliph of al-Andalus and the Zenata Berber kingdom in Morocco, effectively opposed him because of his Ismaili Shi'a affiliation. The Mahdi did not follow Maliki law, but taxed harshly, incurring further resentment. His capital Mahdiya was more a fort than a princely city. The Maghrib was disrupted, being contested between the Zenata and the Sanhaja favoring the Fatimids.Julien, History of North Africa pp. 56‚Äì60.The Sanhaja Berbers were associated with the Kotama. H. Mones, \\"The conquest of North Africa and the Berber resistance\\" in General History of Africa (1992), volume III, pp. 118‚Äì119. After the death of the Mahdi, there came the Kharijite revolt of 935, which under Abu Yazid (nicknamed \\"the man on a donkey\\") was said by 943 to be spreading chaos far and wide.This view of the revolt has been questioned. Cf., Aziz al-Azmeh, Ibn Khaldun in Modern Scholarship pp. 215‚Äì218. The Mahdi's son, the Fatimid caliph al-Qa'im, became besieged in Mahdiya. Eventually Abu Yazid was defeated by the next Fatimid caliph, Ishmail, who then moved his residence to Kairouan. Fatimid rule continued to be under attack from Sunni Islamic states to the west, e.g., the Umayyad Caliphate in Al Andalus.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds pp. 36 & 39; Julian, History of North Africa pp. 66‚Äì67. In 969 the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz sent his best general Jawhar al-Rumi leading a Kotama Berber army against Egypt. He managed the conquest without great difficulty. The Shi'a Fatimids founded al-Qahira (Cairo) [\\"the victorious\\" or the \\"city of Mars\\"]. In 970 the Fatimids also founded the world-famous al- Azhar mosque, which later became the leading Sunni theological center.I. Hrbek, \\"The emergence of the Fatimids\\" in General History of Africa, volume III, pp. 163‚Äì175, 171 (Paris: UNESCO; Berkeley: Univ.of California 1992, abridged edition). Three years later al-Mu'izz the caliph left Ifriqiyah for Egypt, taking everything, \\"his treasures, his administrative staff, and the coffins of his predecessors.\\"Laroui, History of the Maghrib p. 133. Once centered in Egypt the Fatimids expanded their possessions further, northeast to Syria and southeast to Mecca, while retaining control of Northwest Africa. From Cairo they were to enjoy relative success; they never returned to Ifriqiyah.Meanwhile, the Kotama Berbers, worn out from their conflicts on behalf of the Fatimids, disappeared from the life of al-Maghrib. Julien, History of North Africa pp. 54‚Äì55. =Zirid succession= After removing their capital to Cairo, the Fatimids withdrew from direct governance of al-Maghrib, which they delegated to a local vassal, namely Buluggin ibn Ziri a Sanhaja Berber of the central Maghrib. As a result of civil war following his death, the Fatimid vassalage split in two: for Ifriqiya the Zirid (972‚Äì1148); and for the western lands [present day Algeria]: the Hammadid (1015‚Äì1152).Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds(1986) pp. 36 & 39\\\\. The Hammadids were named for Hammad, Buluggin's son. Civic security was chronically poor, due to political quarrels between the Zirids and the Hammadids, and attacks from Sunni states to the west. Although the Maghrib remained submerged in political confusion, at first the Fatimid province of Ifriqiya continued relatively prosperous under the Zirids. Soon however the Saharan trade began to decline, caused by changing consumer demand, as well as by encroachments by rival traders from the Fatimids to the east and from the rising power of the al-Murabit movement to the west. This decline in the Saharan trade caused a rapid deterioration to the city of Kairouan, the political and cultural center of the Zirid state. To compensate, the Zirids encouraged the commerce of their coastal cities, which did begin to quicken; however, they faced tough challenges from Mediterranean traders of the rising city-states of Genoa and Pisa.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 40‚Äì41, 42. Later, Normans from Sicily invaded coastal Ifriqiya. Ibid., p. 43. In 1048, for economic and popular reasons, the Zirids dramatically broke with the Shi'a Fatimid suzerainty from Cairo; instead the Zirids chose to become Sunni (always favored by most Maghribi Muslims) and declaring their allegiance to the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad. Many shia were killed in disturbances throughout Ifriqiya. The Zirid state seized Fatimid coinage. Sunni Maliki jurists were reestablished as the prevailing school of law.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 39‚Äì40, 41. In retaliation, the Fatimids sent against the Zirids an invasion of nomadic Arabians who had already migrated into Egypt; these bedouins were induced by the Fatimids to continue westward into Ifriqiya.The Arabian tribe Banu Hilal, as well as the Banu Sulaym, both then residing in upper Egypt. I. Hrbek, \\"The emergence of the Fatimids\\" in General History of Africa, volume III, pp. 163‚Äì175, 173‚Äì174 (Paris: UNESCO; Berkeley: Univ.of California 1992, abridged edition). Banu Hilal in genealogical scheme of the Banu 'Amir. The arriving Bedouins of the Banu Hilal defeated in battle Zirid and Hammadid armies and sacked Kairouan in 1057. It has been said at much of the Maghrib's misfortunes to follow could be traced to the chaos and regression occasioned by their arrival, although opinion is not unanimous.Negative view of the Banu Hilal has been challenged; cf., Aziz al-Azmeh, Ibn Khaldun in Modern Scholarship pp. 218‚Äì222. In Arab lore Abu Zayd al-Hilali the leader of the Banu Hilal is a hero, as in the folk epic Taghribat Bani Hilal. The Banu Hilal originated from the tribal confederacy of the Banu 'Amir, located generally in southwest Arabia.Cf. Laroui, The History of the Maghrib pp. 147‚Äì156. As the Banu Halali tribes took control of the plains, the local sedentary people were forced to take refuge in the mountains; in prosperous central and northern Ifriqiya farming gave way to pastoralism. Even after the fall of the Zirids the Banu Hilal were a source of disorder, as in the 1184 insurrection of the Banu Ghaniya.Julien, History of North Africa, p. 116.Ibn Khaldun viewed the Banu Hilal as destroying locust. Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 41‚Äì42. These rough Arab newcomers did constitute a second large Arab immigration into Ifriqiya, and accelerated the process of Arabization, with the Berber languages decreasing in use in rural areas as a result of this Bedouin ascendancy.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib pp. 80‚Äì86. Substantially weakened, the Zirids lingered on, while the regional economy declined, with civil society adrift. =Perspectives and trends= The Fatimids were Shi'a (specifically, of the more controversial Isma'ilis branch), whose leadership came from the then unpopular east. Today, of course, the majority of Tunisians now identify as members of the opposing Sunni. The Fatimids did initially inspire the allegiance of Berber elements. Yet once installed Fatimid rule greatly disrupted social harmony in Ifriqiya; they imposed high, unorthodox taxes, leading to the Kharijite revolt.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 83‚Äì84. Later, the Fatimids relocated to Cairo. Although originally a client of the Fatimid Shi'a Caliphate in Egypt, eventually the Zirids expelled the Fatimids from Ifriqiya. In return, the Fatimids managed to send the destructive Banu Hilal to Ifriqiya, which led to chaotic, ragged social conditions, during a period of economic decline. The Zirid dynasty has been viewed historically as a Berber kingdom, essentially founded by a Sanhaja Berber leader.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 39‚Äì40. Also, from the far west of al-Maghrib, the Sunni Umayyad Caliphate of C√≥rdoba long opposed and battled against the Shi'a Fatimids, whether based in Ifriqiya or in Egypt.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1977) pp. 134, 138, 141, 147. Accordingly, Tunisians may evidence faint pride in the great extent and relative endurance, the peace and prosperity at Fatimid rule brought to Egypt, and in the Fatimid Caliphate in Islamic history. During the interval of Shi'a rule, the Berber people appear to have moved ideologically, from a popular antagonism to the Sunni east, toward an acquiescence to its orthodoxy, though of course mediated by their own Maliki law (viewed as one of the four orthodox madhhab by the Sunni). In addition to the above grievances against the Fatimids, during the Fatimid era the prestige of exercising cultural leadership within al-Maghrib shifted decisively away from Ifriqiya and instead came to be the prize of al- Andalus.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 90. Norman Africa The \\"Kingdom of Africa\\" (Regno d'Africa) pinpointed in red Anarchy in Ifriqiya (Tunisia) made it a target for the Norman kingdom in Sicily,The Normans ruled Sicily for over one hundred years, until in 1197 and the Hohenstaufens. Hearder, Italy. A Short History pp. 55, 58. which between 1134 and 1148 seized Mahdia, Gabes, Sfax, and the island of Jerba. The Kingdom of Africa was an extension of the frontier zone of the Siculo-Norman state in the former Roman province of Africa (Ifrƒ´qiya in Tunisian Arabic), corresponding to Tunisia and parts of Algeria and Libya today. The main primary sources for the kingdom are Arabic (Muslim);All the Arabic sources can be found in Michele Amari, Biblioteca arabo-sicula (Rome and Turin: 1880). the Latin (Christian) sources are scanter. According to Hubert Houben, since \\"Africa\\" was never mentioned in the royal title of the kings of Sicily, \\"one ought not to speak of a 'Norman kingdom of Africa'.\\"Houben, Roger II, 83. Rather, \\"[Norman Africa] really amounted to a constellation of Norman-held towns along coastal Ifrƒ´qiya.\\"Dalli, \\"Bridging Europe and Africa\\", 79. The Sicilian conquest of Africa began under Roger II in 1146‚Äì48. Sicilian rule consisted of military garrisons in the major towns, exactions on the local Muslim population, protection of Christians and the minting of coin. The local aristocracy was largely left in place, and Muslim princes controlled the civil government under Sicilian oversight. Economic connections between Sicily and Africa, which were strong before the conquest, were strengthened, while ties between Africa and northern Italy were expanded. Early in the reign of William I, the \\"kingdom\\" of Africa fell to the Almohads (1158‚Äì60). Its most enduring legacy was the realignment of Mediterranean powers brought about by its demise and the Siculo-Almohad peace finalised in 1180. =Conquest of Tripoli and Mahdia= In 1142/3, Roger II attacked Tripoli, further south down the coast from Mahdia. In 1146 he besieged it and took it. The city had already been depleted by a series of famines and was practically in a state of civil war when Roger's troops assaulted it. It was still an important port on the sea route from the Maghreb to Egypt.Abulafia, \\"The Norman Kingdom of Africa\\", 32‚Äì33. Several of the minor emirs in the vicinity of Tripoli sought Sicilian overlordship after this. Y≈´suf, the ruler of Gab√®s, wrote to Roger requesting \\"the robes and letter of appointment making me wƒÅli of Gab√®s, and I shall be your deputy there, as are the Ban≈´ Matr≈´h who hold Tripoli from you.\\"Abulafia, \\"The Norman Kingdom of Africa\\", 34, quoting Ibn al-Athƒ´r, The Complete History. Roger complied and Y≈´suf, in his new robes, read out the letter of appointment to an assemblage of notables. Gab√®s had long been an irritant to Mahdia, and al-Hasan of Mahdia attacked it and brought back Y≈´suf to Mahdia, and stoned him to death. It is possible that Roger's attack on Mahdia in 1148 was a response to this insubordination on the part of its emir, but Ibn al- Athƒ´r suggested that Roger was merely taking advantage of a famine in Africa, despite the fact that he had a treaty with al-Hasan until 1150. In June 1148 Roger sent his admiral George of Antioch, a former Mahdian officer, against al-Hasan. Off the island of Pantelleria the Sicilian fleet encountered a Mahdia ship bearing some carrier pigeons. George had the birds sent home with false messages that the fleet was headed for Byzantium. When the Sicilians reached Mahdia on 22 June, the emir and his court fled the unprepared city leaving their treasure behind. This was seized as booty, but the Sicilians were given only two hours to plunder the city while its Muslim inhabitants took refuge in Christian homes and churches. Roger quickly issued a royal protection, or amƒÅn, to all the city's inhabitants. According to Ibn abƒ´- Dƒ´nƒÅr, George \\"restored both cities of Zawƒ´la and Mahdiyya; lent money to the merchants; gave alms to the poor; placed the administration of justice in the hands of qadi acceptable to the population; and arranged well the government of these two cities.\\"Quoted in Abulafia, \\"The Norman Kingdom of Africa\\", 34. Food was released to encourage refugees to return. On 1 July the city of Sousse (Susa), ruled by al-Hasan's son 'Ali, surrendered without a fight, and 'Ali fled to his father in Almohad Morocco. On 12 July Sfax fell after a short resistance. The Africans \\"were treated humanely\\" and an amƒÅn full of \\"fine promises\\" was granted for the entire province, according to Ibn al- Athƒ´r.Abulafia, \\"The Norman Kingdom of Africa\\", 35. Ibn Khaldun, in his Kitab al-Ibar, records the abuse the Christians of Sfax heaped on their Muslim neighbours.Abulafia, \\"The Norman Kingdom of Africa\\", 42 n. 87. The Ban≈´ Matr≈´h were left in power in Tripoli, and in Sfax Roger appointed Umar ibn al-Husayn al-Furrƒ´ƒÅnƒ´, whose father was brought to Sicily as a hostage for his son's good behaviour. The Arabic sources are unanimous in presenting Umar's father as encouraging his son to rebel nonetheless.Abulafia, \\"The Norman Kingdom of Africa\\", 37‚Äì38. The town of Barasht (Bresk) and the isles of Kerkennah fell to Roger, as did the unruly desert tribes. After the brief period of conquest and acquisition, \\"the dominion of the Franks [Normans] extended from Tripoli to the borders of Tunis, and from the western Maghrib to Qayrawan\\".Abulafia, \\"The Norman Kingdom of Africa\\", 35, quoting Ibn al-Athƒ´r. =Submission of Tunis and internal unrest= Roger became involved in a war with Byzantium after 1148, and so was unable to follow up his conquests with an attack on Tunis. In fear, the Tunisians sent grain to Sicily in hopes of averting an attack, according to Ibn Idhari. This should probably be seen as tribute and submission, since Ibn Idhar writes that Roger was still in power in the city when the Almohads attacked it in 1159, although he was in fact dead.Abulafia, \\"The Norman Kingdom of Africa\\", 35, quoting Ibn Idhari. The Venetian chronicler Andrea Dandolo is probably correct in asserting: \\"and the kings of Tunis paid him [Roger] tribute\\" (regemque Tunixii sibi tributarium fecit). Roger died in 1154, and was succeeded by his son William I, who continued to rule Africa. His accession was taken for an opportunity by the native officials, who clamoured for more powers to tax. The Arabic historians Ibn al- Athƒ´r and Ibn Khaldun, both hoped that Roger would defend his African lands against Almohad extremism and intolerance. After his death, some Muslim officials demanded that sermons be preached against the Almohads in the mosques.Abulafia, \\"The Norman Kingdom of Africa\\", 42‚Äì43. Almohads (al- Muwahiddin) The only strong Muslim power then in the Maghreb was at the newly emerging Almohads, led by their caliph a Berber Abd al-Mu'min. He responded in several military campaigns which by 1160 compelled the Normans to retreat back to Sicily.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (Cambridge Univ. 19) p. 109.Cf., Haskins, The Normans in European History (New York 1915, reprint Norton Library 1966) p. 192. The Almohads were also successful in driving off incursions by the Ayyubids in the 1180s, although they managed to occupy southern coastal areas intermittently during this period.http://al- qantara.revistas.csic.es/index.php/al-qantara/article/download/303/294 =Movement and Empire= Almohad Empire (1147‚Äì1269) at it greatest extent. The Almohad movement [Arabic al-Muwahhidun, \\"the Unitarians\\"] ruled variously in the Maghrib starting about 1130 until 1248 (locally until 1275).Cyril Glass√©, The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam (San Francisco: HarperCollins 1989) pp. 38‚Äì39.Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement (Princeton Univ. 1969) pp. 3, 41, 48‚Äì49, 92.\\"Almohad\\" is from the Spanish for the Arabic al-Muwahhidun. Abun- Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 105 n.1. This movement had been founded by Ibn Tumart (1077‚Äì1130), a Masmuda Berber from the Atlas mountains of Morocco, who became the mahdi. After a pilgrimage to Mecca followed by study, he had returned to the Maghrib about 1218 inspired by the teachings of al-Ash'ari and al-Ghazali.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 103, stating at although Ibn Tumart was clearly influenced by al-Ghazali, the two never personally met (citing Goldziher). A charismatic leader, he preached an interior awareness of the Unity of God.Roger Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement in North Africa in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries (Princeton Univ. 1969) pp. 3‚Äì11, 25‚Äì26. A puritan and a hard-edged reformer, he gathered a strict following among the Berbers in the Atlas, founded a radical community, and eventually began an armed challenge to the current rulers, the Almoravids (1056‚Äì1147).Le Tourneau reports (and criticizes) the story that the Almoravids (with Maliki legal backing) burned the book Revival of Religious Sciences by Al-Ghazali (1058‚Äì1111), which was said to have antagonized Ibn Tumart. Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement in North Africa (1969) pp. 6‚Äì8, 14 These Almoravids [Arabic al-Murabitun, from Ribat, e.g., \\"defenders\\"] had also been a Berber Islamic movement of the Maghrib,Predominantly of the Sanhaja confederacy of Berbers (then located across the far west Sahara), led particularly by the Lamtuna tribe.

Although the Almoravids had once ruled from Mauritania (south of Morocco) toal-Andalus (southern Spain), Almoravid rule had never reached to Infriqiya.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 94. Following Ibn Tumart's death, Abd al-Mu'minal-Kumi (c.1090‚Äì1163) became the Almohad caliph, circa 1130.Abd al-Mu'min was the first non‚ÄìArab to take the caliphal title amiral-mu'minin [commander of the faithful].

He immediately had attacked the ruling Almoravids and had wrestled Morocco away from them by 1147, suppressing subsequent revolts there. Then he crossed the straits, occupying al-Andalus (in Spain).Unfortunately, as a result of the Almohad invasion, whose zealots forced many of the conquered to choose between conversion or flight, the family of the Jewish philosopher and Talmudist, Moshe ben Maimon, then thirteen, had to flee C√≥rdoba in 1148, eventually finding safety in Fatimid Egypt.

Yet twenty years later, by 1184, the revolt by the Banu Ghaniya had spread from the Balearic Islands to Ifriqiya (Tunisia), causing problems for the Almohad regime for the next fifty years.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 114‚Äì118. =Rule of the Maghrib= Ibn Tumart, the Almohad founder, left writings in which his theological ideas mix with the political. Therein he claimed that the leader, the mahdi, is infallible.An idea some sunni condemn as unorthodox, i.e., as similar to the shi'a. Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement (1969) pp. 28‚Äì29.His writing are contained in Le Livre de Mohammed Ibn Toumert [The Book of M. ibn Tumart], edited by Jean‚ÄìDominique Luciani (Algiers 1903), introduced by Ignaz Goldziher. Ibn Tumart created a hierarchy from among his followers which persisted long after the Almohad era (i.e., in Tunisia under the Hafsids), based not only on a specie of ethnic loyalty,\\"Every member of the community had to belong to a tribe\\" under the control of their chief. Too, only Berbers of the Masmuda tribe could claim the title muwahiddin (Almohad). Abun-Nasr A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 105, 110. such as the \\"Council of Fifty\\" [ahl al-Khamsin], and the assembly of \\"Seventy\\" [ahl al-Saqa], but more significantly based on a formal structure for an inner circle of governance at would transcend tribal loyalties, namely, (a) his ahl al-dar or \\"people of the house\\", a sort of privy council, (b) his ahl al-'Ashra or the \\"Ten\\", originally composed of his first ten followers, and (c) a variety of offices. Ibn Tumart trained his own talaba or ideologists, as well as his huffaz, who function was both religious and military. There is lack of certainty about some details, but general agreement at Ibn Tumart sought to reduce the \\"influence of the traditional tribal framework.\\" Later historical developments \\"were greatly facilitated by his original reorganization because it made possible collaboration among tribes\\" not likely to otherwise coalesce.Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement (1969) pp. 31‚Äì34.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1977) pp. 178‚Äì179. These organizing and group solidarity preparations made by Ibn Tumart were \\"most methodical and efficient\\" and a \\"conscious replica\\" of the Medina period of the prophet Muhammad.Laroui The History of the Maghrib (1977) pp. 179‚Äì180.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 105‚Äì106. The mahdi Ibn Tumart also had championed the idea of strict Islamic law and morals displacing unorthodox aspects of Berber custom.Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement (1969) pt. 20.E.g., Ibn Tumart condemned unveiled women and musical instruments. Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 104. at his early base at Tinmal, Ibn Tumart functioned as \\"the custodian of the faith, the arbiter of moral questions, and the chief judge.\\" Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 106. Yet because of the narrow legalism then common among Maliki jurists and because of their influence in the Almoravid regime,In al-Andalus the Maliki school had turned inward to develop only those issues already present in its own fiqh; this had led to the burning of al-Ghazali's book. Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 99.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1970, 1977) p. 169.Le Tourneau The Almohad Movement (1969) p. 14. Ibn Tumart did not favor the Maliki school of law; nor did he favor any of the four recognized madhhabs.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 104.Compare: Marshall Hodgson states that the Almohads did follow the Zahiri madhhab. The Venture of Islam in II:269. The Zahiris, not one of the recognized four, taught a \\"literal\\" interpretation of the sources of law. In practice, however, the Maliki school of law survived and by default eventually functioned in an official fashion (except during the reign of Abu Yusuf Ya'qubal-Mansur (1184‚Äì1199) who was loyal to Ibn Tumart's teachings). After of century of oscillation, the caliph Abu al-'Ala Idris al-Ma'mun broke with the narrow ideology of prior Almohad regimes (first articulated by the mahdi Ibn Tumart) at had continued to function on and off, and for the most part, at the end, poorly; circa 1230, he affirmed the reinstitution of the then-reviving Malikite rite, perennially popular in al-Maghrib.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 111, 114.Cf., Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement (1969) pp. 94‚Äì96.Abdallah Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (Princeton Univ. 1977) pp. 188‚Äì189.

The sufi master theologian Ibn 'Arabi was born in Murcia in 1165. Under the Almohads architecture flourished, the Giralda being built in Seville and the pointed arch being introduced.Cyril Grasse, A Concise Enciclopedia of Islam (San Francisco 1991) pp. 174‚Äì175, 176‚Äì177, and 38‚Äì39. \\"There is no better indication of the importance of the Almohad empire than the fascination it has exerted on all subsequent rulers in the Maghrib.\\"Abdallah Laroui, L'Histoire du Maghreb (Paris: Librairie Fran√ßois Masero 1970), translated as The History of the Maghrib (Princeton Univ. 1977) p. 201. It was an empire Berber in its inspiration, and whose imperial fortunes were under the direction of Berber leaders. The unitarian Almohads had gradually modified the original ambition of strictly implementing their founder's designs; in this way the Almohads were similar to the preceding Almoravids (also Berber). Yet their movement probably worked to deepen the religious awareness of the Muslim people across the Maghrib. Nonetheless, it could not suppress other traditions and teachings, and alternative expressions of Islam, including the popular cult of saints, the sufis, as well as the Maliki jurists, survived.Cf., Abdallah Laroui, L'Histoire du Maghreb (Paris: Librairie Fran√ßois Masero 1970), translated as The History of the Maghrib (Princeton Univ. 1977) pp. 186‚Äì192.Sufis mystical orders spread after the collapse of the Almohad regime. Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 119. The Almohad empire (like its predecessor the Almoravid) eventually weakened and dissolved. Except for the Muslim Kingdom of Granada, Spain was lost. In Morocco, the Almohads were to be followed by the Merinids; in Ifriqiya (Tunisia), by the Hafsids (who claimed to be the heirs of the unitarian Almohads).Cyril Grasse, A Concise Enciclopedia of Islam (San Francisco 1989, 1991) pp. 38‚Äì39. Hafsid dynasty of Tunis The Hafsid dynasty (1230‚Äì1574) succeeded Almohad rule in Ifriqiya, with the Hafsids claiming to represent the true spiritual heritage of its founder, the Mahdi Ibn Tumart (c.1077‚Äì1130). Under the Hafsids, Tunisia would eventually regain for a time cultural primacy in the Maghrib. =Political chronology= Abu Hafs 'Umar Inti (or:al-Hintati)Not to be confused with Abu Hafs 'Umar, son of the first Almohad caliph 'Abd al-Mu'min (r.1132‚Äì1163), his vizier, and brother of the next caliph Abu Ya'qub Yusuf (r.1163‚Äì1184). Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement in North Africa pp. 67‚Äì68; cf., Julien, History of North Africa pp. 114‚Äì115. was one of the Ten, the crucial early adherents of the Almohad movement [al-Muwahhidun], circa 1121. These Ten were companions of Ibn Tumart the Mahdi, and formed an inner circle consulted on all important matters. Abu Hafs 'Umar Inti, wounded in battle near Marrakesh in 1130, was for a long time a powerful figure within the Almohad movement. His son 'Umar al-Hintati was appointed by the Almohad caliph Muhammad an-Nasir as governor of Ifriqiya in 1207 and served until his death in 1221. His son, the grandson of Abu Hafs, was Abu Zakariya.Le Tourneau, The Almohad Movement in North Africa (Princeton Univ. 1969) pp. 24, 27, 32‚Äì33, 41, 65‚Äì66; Julien, History of North Africa pp. 102, 108, 115, 120, 141; Laroui, History of the Maghrib pp. 179‚Äì180, 183‚Äì184, 188. Flag of Tunis under the Hafsids. (Catalan Atlas, circa 1375) Abu ZakariyaAbu Zakariya later was also known as Yahya I. (1203‚Äì1249) served the Almohads in Ifriqiya as governor of Gab√®s, then in 1226 as governor of Tunis. In 1229 during disturbances within the Almohad movement, Abu Zakariya declared his independence: hence, the start of the Hafsid dynasty. In the next few years he secured his hold on the cities of Ifriqiya, then captured Tripolitania (1234) to the east, and Algiers (1235) to the west and later added Tlemcen (1242). He solidified his rule among the Berber confederacies. Government structure of the Hafsid state followed the Almohad model, a rather strict centralization. Abu Zakariya's succession to the Almohads was briefly acknowledged in Friday prayer by several states in al-Andalus and in Morocco. Diplomatic relations were opened with Venice, Genoa, Sicily, and Aragon. Abu Zakariya became the foremost ruler in the Maghrib.Abdallah Laroui, L'Histoire du Maghreb: Un essai de synthese (Paris: Librairie Francois Maspero 1970), translated as History of the Maghrib. An interpretive essay (Princeton Univ. 1977) pp. 178, 182, 195. Julien, History of North Africa pp. 141‚Äì142, 154. For an historic moment, the son of Abu Zakariya and self-declared caliph of the Hafsids, al-MustansirThe honorific surname of al-Mustansir was given to Abu 'Abd Allah, son of Au Zakariya. (In Tunisian history there was earlier another Abu 'Abd Allah, namely the Isma'ili dai who prepared the way for the Fatimid Mahdi; and there was also another Fatimid caliph known as al-Mustansir.) (r.1249‚Äì1277), was recognised as caliph by Mecca and the Islamic world (1259‚Äì1261), following termination of the Abbasid caliphate by the Mongols (in 1258). Yet the moment passed; the Hafsids remained a local sovereignty.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam 2: 291‚Äì292, 477. In 1261 Baybars had become sultan of Egypt and he revived the Abbasid Caliphate.Julien, History of North Africa pp. 142‚Äì143. In 1270 King Louis IX of France, whose brother was the king of Sicily, landed an army near Tunis; disease devastated their camp.Steven Runciman, History of the Crusades (Cambridge Univ. 1954; Harper reprint 1967) pp. 291‚Äì292. Later, Hafsid influence was reduced by the rise of the Moroccan Marinids of Fez, who captured and lost Tunis twice (1347, and 1357).Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 229‚Äì231. Yet Hafsid fortunes would recover; two notable rulers being Abu Faris (1394‚Äì1434) and his grandson Abu 'Amr 'Uthman (r. 1435‚Äì1488).Julien, History of North Africa pp. 147‚Äì151. Toward the end, internal disarray within the Hafsid dynasty created vulnerabilities, while a great power struggle arose between Spaniard and Turk over control of the Mediterranean. The Hafsid dynasts became pawns, subject to the rival strategies of the combatants. By 1574 Ifriqiya had been incorporated into the Ottoman Empire.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 48‚Äì52. =Commerce and Trade= Bacino del Mediterraneo, dall'Atlante manoscritto del 1582‚Äì1584 ca. Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Vittorio Emanuele II, Roma (cart. naut. 2 ‚Äì cart. naut 6/1‚Äì2). The entire Maghrib, as well as Tunisia under the early Hafsids, enjoyed an era of prosperity due to the rise of Saharan-Sudanese as well as the Mediterranean trade, the latter including trade with Europe.Cf., E. Ashtor, A Social and Economic History of the Near East in the Middle Ages (London: Collins 1976). Trade had quickened in the Mediterranean after the Fatimids in Egypt took over the trade to India from the Persian Gulf ports. In 996 there were said to be at least 160 Italian merchants in Cairo. Tunis was a major center of this east‚Äìwest Mediterranean trade, which continued for four hundred years. Ibid. pp. 195‚Äì196. While Cairo sent west the spices of India and raw flax, Tunis chiefly sent silk, olive oil, and soap east. Ibid. pp. 197‚Äì198. Across the region, repeated buy and sell dealings with Christians led to the development of practices and structured arrangements at were crafted to ensure security, customs revenue, and commercial profit.Two commercial letters originally in Arabic sent from Tunis and addressed to merchants of Pisa, dated 1201, can be found in Robert S. Lopez and Irving W. Raymond, Medieval Trade in the Mediterranean World. Illustrative documents translated with introductions and notes (Columbia Univ. 1955, 2001) pp. 384‚Äì388 'Solidarity of Muslim and Christian Merchants,' docs. no. 190 and no. 191. The principal customs ports were then: Tunis, Sfax, Mahdia, Jerba, and Gab√©s (in modern Tunisia); Oran, Bougie (Bejaia), and B√¥ne (Annaba) (in modern Algeria); and Tripoli (in modern Libya). Generally at such ports, the imports were off loaded and transferred to a customs area from where they were deposited in a sealed warehouse, or funduq, until the duties and fees were paid. The Tunis customs service was a stratified bureaucracy. At its head was often a member of the ruling nobility or musharif, called al-Caid, who not only managed the staff collecting duties but also might negotiate commercial agreements, conclude treaties, and would act as judge in legal disputes involving foreigners. The amount of the duties varied, usually five or ten percent. It was possible for an arriving ship to deliver its goods and pick up the return cargo in several days time. Christian merchants of the Mediterranean, usually organized by their city‚Äìof‚Äìorigin, set up and maintained their own trading facilities in these North African customs ports to handle the flow of merchandise and marketing.Wm. Spencer, Algiers in the Age of the Corsairs (1976) pp. 8‚Äì11. Islamic law during this era had developed a specific institution to regulate community morals, or hisba, which included the order and security of public markets, the supervision of market transactions, and related matters. The urban marketplace [Arabic souk, pl. iswak] was generally a street of shops selling the same or similar commodities (vegetables, cloth, metalware, lumber, etc.).In the villages and rural areas, there was generally a market day each week at a fixed location for trading and bartering The city official charged with these responsibilities was called the muhtasib.Knut S. Vikor, Between God and the Sultan. A History of Islamic Law (Oxford Univ. 2004) pp. 195‚Äì198. Vikor points out at hisba, which means \\"balance\\" in Arabic, also has the sense of achieving the common good and acting against evil, duties required of all Muslims, but especially of the Sultan. In some current Islamist movements, it can be viewed as license to vigilante action, e.g., breaking into homes to smash bottles of alcohol. Such private initiative also challenges the legitimacy of the government to keep public order.John L. Esposito, The Oxford Dictionary of Islam (Oxford Univ. 2003) pp. 114, 213. In effecting public order in the urban markets, the muhtasib enforced fair commercial dealing (merchants truthfully quoting the local price to rural people, honest weights and measures, but not quality of goods nor price per se), keeping roadways open, regulating the safety of building construction, ensuring the metal value of existing coinage and minting new coin. The authority of the muhtasib, with his group of assistants, was somewhere between a qadi (judge) and the police, or on other occasions perhaps between a public prosecutor or trade commissioner and the mayor or a high city official. Often a leading judge or mufti held the position. The muhtasib did not hear contested litigation, but nonetheless could order the pain and humiliation of up to 40 lashes, remand to debtor's prison, order a shop closed, and expel from the city. The authority of the muhtasib did not extend into the countryside.Knut S. Vikor, Between God and the Sultan. A History of Islamic Law (Oxford Univ. 2004) pp. 197‚Äì198. During this period from al-Andalus came Muslim and Jewish immigrants with appreciated talents, e.g., trade connections, crafts, and agricultural techniques. Regarding general prosperity, however, there was a sharp economic decline starting in the fourteenth century due to a variety of factors.E.g., Laroui, History of the Maghrib p. 221. Later, Mediterranean trade gave way to corsair raiding activity. {IN PROGRESS} =Society and culture= As a result of the initial prosperity, al-Mustansir transformed his capital Tunis, constructing a palace and the Abu Fihr park; he also created an estate near Bizerte (said by Ibn Khaldun to be without equal in the world).Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 141. An unfortunate divide, however, developed between the governance of the cities and of the countryside; at times the city-based rulers would grant rural tribes autonomy ('iqta') in exchange for their support in intra-maghribi struggles.Laroui, History of the Maghrib pp. 211‚Äì212 (Banu Hilal), cf. 216.Julien, History of North Africa pp. 145‚Äì146 (Beni Sulaim). This tribal independence of the central authority meant also at when the center grew weak, the periphery might still remain strong and resilient.Cf., Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) p. 53. {IN PROGRESS} Bedouin ArabsHere, the Banu Suaim. Most of the Banu Hilal had by this period moved on to Morocco. Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 129, 144‚Äì145. continued to arrive into the 13th century; with their tribal ability to raid and war still intact, they remained influential. The Arab language came to be predominant, except for a few Berber-speaking areas, e.g., Kharijite Djerba, and the desert south. Also, Arab Muslim and Jewish migration continued to come into Ifriqiya from al- Andalus, especially after the fall of Granada in 1492, the last Muslim state ruling on the Iberian peninsula. These newly arriving immigrants brought infusions of the developed arts of al-Andalus.Julien, History of North Africa pp. 151‚Äì153. The Andalusian tradition of music and poetry was discussed by Ahmad al-Tifashi (1184‚Äì1253) of Tunis, in his Muta'at al-Asma' fi 'ilm al- sama' [Pleasure to the Ears, on the Art of Music], in volume 41 of his enciclopedia.Benjamin M. Liu and James T. Monroe, Ten Hispano-Arabic Strophic Songs in the Modern Oral Tradition (Univ.of California 1989) pp. 2 & 35; al- Tifasi's text translated pp. 36‚Äì69. After a hiatus under the Almohads,Ibn Tumart is said not to have followed any recognized madhhab [see the Almohads or al-Muwahiddin era, the Rule over the Maghrib section, above]; yet the Almohads may have followed the Zahiri school of law (Hodgson, Venture of Islam in II:269), which is now extinct. the Maliki school of law resumed its full traditional jurisdiction over the Maghrib. During the 13th century, the Maliki school had undergone substantial liberalizing changes due in part to Iraqi influence.Maghribi students were drawn to Iraq by the teachings left by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1209). By the end of the 13th century, Ibn Zaytun Haskuni Mishaddali had introduced transformations in Maliki fiqh which were incorporated in the Hafsid restoration. Mahsin Mahdi, Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History pp. 30‚Äì31. Under Hafsid jurisprudents the concept of maslahah or \\"public interest\\" developed in the operation of their madhhab. This opened up Maliki fiqh to considerations of necessity and circumstance with regard to the general welfare of the community. By this means, local custom was admitted in the Sharia of Malik, to become an integral part of the legal discipline.Hodgson, Venture of Islam in II:478. Later, the Maliki theologian Muhammad ibn 'Arafa (1316‚Äì1401) of Tunis studied at the Zaituna library, said to contain 60,000 volumes.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) p. 150. Education was improved by the institution of a system of madrasah. Sufism, e.g., Sidi Bin 'Arus (d. 1463 Tunis) founder of the Arusiyya tariqah, became increasingly established, linking city and countryside.Trimingham, The Sufi Orders in Islam (Oxford Univ. 1971) p. 87The sufi shaikhs assumed the religious authority once held by the unitarian Almohads, according to Abun- Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 119. Poetry blossomed, as did architecture. For the moment, Tunisia had regained cultural leadership of the Maghrib.Julien, History of North Africa pp. 159‚Äì161. =Ibn Khaldun= A major social philosopher, Ibn Khaldun (1332‚Äì1406) is recognized as a pioneer in sociology, historiography, and related disciplines. Although having Yemeni ancestry, his family enjoyed centuries-long residency in al-Andalus before leaving in the 13th century for Ifriqiyah. As a native of Tunis, he spent much of his life under the Hafsids, whose regime he served on occasion. Ibn Khaldun entered into a political career early on, working under a succession of different rulers of small states, whose designs unfolded amid shifting rivalries and alliances. at one point he rose to vizier; however, he also spent a year in prison. His career required several relocations, e.g., Fez, Granada, eventually Cairo where he died. In order to write he retired for a while from active political life. Later, after his pilgrimage to Mecca, he served as Grand Qadi of the Maliki rite in Egypt (he was appointed and dismissed several times). While he was visiting Damascus, Tamerlane took the city; the conqueror interviewed the elderly jurist and social philosopher, yet Ibn Khaldun managed to escape back to his life in Egypt.Muhsin Mahdi, Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History (London: George Allen & Unwin 1957; reprint Univ. Chicago 1964) pp. 53‚Äì62 (in Egypt), pp. 58‚Äì60 (Timur); Cyril Glass√©, The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam (HarperSanFrancisco 1991), \\"Ibn Khaldun\\" pp. 171‚Äì172. Ibn Khaldun lost his wife and children at sea (on their journey to Egypt) in 1384. Simon, Ibn Khaldun's Science of Human Nature p. 33. The history and historiography written by Ibn Khaldun was informed in theory by his learning as a faylasuf [philosopher].Muhsin Mahdi (Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History (1957) pp. 30‚Äì33) understands that he was influenced directly by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1209) of Iraq, and at least indirectly by al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, and Ibn Rushd. Erwin Rosenthal (Political Thought in Medieval Islam (1958) pp. 104‚Äì105) states that he favored and shared the views of al-Ghazali. Yet it was his participation in the small unstable governments of the region at inspired many of his key insights. His history seeks to account for the apparent cyclical progression of historical states of the Maghrib, whereby: (a) a new ruling association comes to power with strong loyalties, (b) which over the course of several generations fall apart, (c) leading to the collapse of the ruling strata. The social cohesion necessary for the group's initial rise to power, and for the group's ability to maintain it and exercise it, Ibn Khaldun called Asabiyyah.Heinrich Simon, Ibn Khalduns Wissenschaft von der Menschlichen Kultur (Leipzig 1959), translated by Fuad Baali as Ibn Khaldun's Science of Human Culture (Lahore: Ashraf 1978) pp. 68‚Äì88, presents a discussion of this key concept, wherein asab means \\"to bind\\", asabatun means \\"the group\\", asabah means the \\"paternal relationship\\" in the law of inheritance [p. 68, 68n1], and asabiyah means \\"the nature of the group\\" [68‚Äì69]. His seven-volume Kitab al-'Ibar [Book of Examples]Muhsin Mahdi, in his Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History pp. 63‚Äì71, discusses the subtleties of this title. Ibar can mean \\"instructive examples\\" [64], \\"bridge\\" or medium of explanation [66], or \\"bridge between meanings\\" [71]. (shortened title) is a telescoped \\"universal\\" history, which concentrates on the Persian, Arab, and Berber civilizations. Its lengthy prologue, called the Muqaddimah [Introduction], presents the development of long-term political trends and events as a field for the study, characterizing them as human phenomena, in quasi-sociological terms. It is widely considered to be a gem of sustained cultural analysis. Due to his downplaying (or denying) the role of the ethnic Arab people in the development of Islamic science, philosophy and politics, Ibn Khaldun did not attract sufficient interest among Arabs, his studies being neglected in Ifriqiyah‚Äîa trend that has lasted to the present day as his works are considered politically incorrect vis a vis Arab nationalism. However and naturally, in the Persian and Turkish worlds he acquired a sustained following.Muhsin Mahdi, Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History.

In the later books of the Kitab al-'Ibar, he focuses especially on the history of the Berbers of the Maghrib. The perceptive Ibn Khaldun in his narration eventually arrives at historical events he himself witnessed or encountered.There is said to be danger in contemporary use of his local histories, because Ibn Khaldun reluctantly employed highly nuanced \\"folk Maghribi archetypes\\" at conflate Berber and Arab tribal identities with static genres de vie (socio-economic lifestyles), creating \\"mythological entities\\" and a chaos of meaning.

Ottoman Caliphate, and the Beys Ottoman Empire (1299‚Äì1918), here to 1683. A long- term contest for the Mediterranean began in the sixteenth century, between Spaniards (who in 1492 completed the reconquista) and Turks (who had captured Constantinople in 1453). Spain then occupied a series of ports in Northwest Africa, e.g., Oran (1505), Tripoli (1510), Tunis (1534). Some Muslim rulers encouraged Turkish forces to enter the area in order to counter the Spanish presence. The Hafsids of Tunis, however, saw in the Muslim Turks a greater threat and arranged a Spanish alliance.Cf., Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 51‚Äì54.Spain also had a tacit alliance with the Sa'dids of Morocco. Laroui, A History of the Maghrib (1970, 1977) pp. 250‚Äì251.

A country study (3rd ed. 1986). =Janissary Deys= Following imposition in 1574 of permanent Ottoman imperial rule, government in Tunisia was put on a more stable footing after a long period of flux and chaos. The Porte in Constantinople appointed a Pasha as the civil and military authority in Tunisia, which was made a province of the empire. Turkish became the language of the state. The capital city of Tunis was originally garrisoned with 4,000 Janissaries, recruited primarily from Anatolia, commanded by an Agha. The Porte did not maintain the ranks of Janissaries, rather the Pasha in Tunisia himself began to recruit such soldiery from many different regions. From 1574 to 1591 a council (the Diwan), composed of senior military (buluk-bashis) and local notables, advised the provincial government. A Janissary, drawing by Gentile Bellini (15th century). The new energy of Turkish rule was welcome in Tunis, and by the ulama. Although the Ottomans preferred the Hanifi school of law, some Tunisian Maliki jurists were admitted into the administration. Yet the rule remained one of a foreign elite. In the countryside, efficient Turkish troops managed to control the tribes without compromising alliances, but their rule was unpopular. The rural economy was never brought under effective regulation by the central authority. For revenues the government continued to rely primarily on corsair raiding in the Mediterranean. In 1591 Janissary junior officers (deys) who were not of Turkish origin forced the Pasha to acknowledge the authority of one of their own men, called the Dey (elected by his fellow deys). Relatively independent of the Ottomans, the Dey exercised control in the cities. 'Uthman Dey (1598‚Äì1610) and Yusuf Dey (1610‚Äì1637) managed well enough to establish peace and order in place of chronic social turbulence. In the tribal rural areas, control and collection of taxes were assigned to a chieftain, called the Bey [Turkish]. Twice a year, armed expeditions (mahallas) patrolled the countryside, showing the arm of the central authority. As an auxiliary force, the Beys organized rural cavalry (sipahis), mostly Arab, recruited from what came to be called the \\"government\\" (makhzan) tribes.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 55‚Äì57.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 177‚Äì178. =Muradid Beys= The Corsican Murad CursoHis second name \\"Curso\\" indicates his Corsican origin. A Spanish intelligence report of 1568 estimated there were 10,000 renegades in Algiers, of whom 6,000 were Corsicans. Fernand Braudel, The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World (1949, 1966, 1973) pp. I: 159‚Äì160. (d. 1631) had since his youth been sponsored by Ramdan Bey (d. 1613). Murad then followed his benefactor into the office of the Bey, which he exercised effectively; later he was also named Pasha, although his position remained inferior to the Dey. His son Hamuda (1631‚Äì1666) inherited both titles, with the support of the local notables of Tunis. By virtue of his title as Pasha, the Bey came to enjoy the prestige of connection with the Sultan-Caliph in Constantinople. In 1640, upon the death of the Dey, Hamuda Bey maneuvered to establish his control over appointments to at office. Distribution of Altaic languages, which includes Turkish. No consensus exists as to inclusions in or status of the Altaic language family. Japanese and Korean inclusion remains controversial. Under Murad II Bey (1666‚Äì1675), son of Hamuda, the Diwan again functioned as a council of notables. Yet in 1673 the janissary deys, seeing their power ebbing, rose in revolt. During the consequent fighting, the urban forces of the janissary deys fought against the Muradid Beys with their largely rural forces under the tribal shaykhs, and with popular support from city notables. As the Beys secured victory, so did the rural Bedouins and the Tunisian notables, who also emerged triumphant. The Arabic language returned to local official use, although the Muradids continued to use Turkish in the central government, accentuating their elite status and Ottoman connection. At Murad II Bey's death, internal discord with the Muradid family led to armed struggle. The Turkish rulers of Algeria later intervened on behalf of one side in a subsequent domestic conflict; the Algerian forces did not withdraw and proved unpopular. This unfortunate condition of civil discord and Algerian interference persisted. The last Muradid Bey was assassinated in 1702 by Ibrahim Sharif, who then ruled for several years with Algerian backing.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (1977) pp. 255‚Äì256.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 56‚Äì58, 60.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 178‚Äì180. A gradual economic shift occurred during the Muradid era, as corsair raiding decreased due to pressure from Europe, and commercial trading based on agricultural products (chiefly grains) increased due to an integration of the rural population into regional networks. Mediterranean trade, however, continued to be carried by European shipping concerns. The Beys, in order to derive the maximum advantage from the export trade, in addition to taxation instituted government monopolies which mediated between the local producers and foreign merchants. As a result, the rulers and their business partners (drawn from foreign-dominated elites connected to the Ottomans) took a disproportionate share of Tunisia's trading profits.Government control of the economic wealth was evidently common in the region during the 16th century. Cf., Fernand Braudel, The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World (1949, 1966, 1973) pp. I: 449‚Äì451. From such systematic policy in practice would later emerge the Mercantilist economic theory. This precluded the development of local interests, whether rural landowners or a wealthy merchant strata. A social divide persisted, with the important families in Tunisia identified as a \\"Turkish\\" ruling caste.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 58‚Äì61. =Husaynid Beys= The Husaynid Beys ruled from 1705 to 1881, and reigned until 1957. In theory, Tunisia continued as a vassal of the Ottoman empire (the Friday prayer was pronounced in the name of the Ottoman Sultan, money was coined in his honor, and an annual ambassador brought gifts to Istanbul) but the Ottomans never were able to depend on, or exact, obedience. Husayn ibn Ali (1669‚Äì1740), a cavalry officer of Greek Cretan origin, came into power in 1705, remaining in control until 1735. He had won backing from the Tunisian ulama and notables, as well as from the tribes, for his opposition to Algerian influence which was removed. Yet in a succession dispute, his nephew Ali and his son Muhammad fought a divisive civil war, which ended in 1740 with Ali's uncertain victory. This result was reversed in 1756 after ten more years of fighting, but not without meddling by Algeria. Captain William Bainbridge (U.S.A.) with tribute for the Dey of Algiers in 1800; the Pasha of Tripoli declared war in 1801.Clark, Stevens, Alden, Krafft, A Short History of the United States Navy (Philadelphia 1910, revised by Alden in 1927) p. 43 (1793), 61‚Äì92 (1800‚Äì1805), 204‚Äì206 (1807, 1812‚Äì1815). Early Husaynid policy required a careful balance among several divergent parties: the Ottomans, the Turkish speaking elite in Tunisia, and local Tunisians, both urban and rural, notables and clerics, landowners and the more remote tribes. Entanglement with the Ottoman Empire was avoided due to its potential ability to take over the Bey's prerogatives; however, religious ties to the Caliph were fostered, adding prestige to the Beys and winning approval of the local ulama and deference from the notables. Janissaries were still recruited, but increasing reliance was placed on tribal forces. Turkish was spoken at the apex, but use of Arabic increased in government use. Kouloughlis (children of mixed Turkish and Tunisian parentage) and native Tunisians notables were given increased admittance into higher positions and deliberations. Yet the Husaynid Beys did not themselves intermarry with Tunisians; instead they often turned to the institution of mamluks.In Tunisian practice, non-Muslim slave youths were purchased in Ottoman markets, educated with royal scions in high government service and in Islam, converted, given high echelon positions, and often married to royal daughters. Mamluks would number about 100. Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) p. 63. The dynasty never ceased to identify as Ottoman, and therefore privileged. Nonetheless, the local ulama were courted, with funding for religious education and the clerics. Maliki jurist entered government service. Rural marabouts were mollified. Tribal shaykhs were recognized and invited to conferences. Especially favored were a handful of prominent families, Turkish speaking, who were given business and land opportunities, as well as important posts in the government, depending on their loyalty. The French Revolution and reactions to it caused disruptions in European economic activity which provided opportunities for Tunisia to profit handsomely. Hammouda Pasha (1781‚Äì1813) was Bey during this period of prosperity; he also turned back an Algerian invasion in 1807, and quelled a janissary revolt in 1811. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Britain and France secured the Bey's agreement to cease sponsoring or permitting corsair raids, which had resumed during the Napoleonic conflict. Then in the 1820s economic activity in Tunisia took a steep downturn. The Tunisian government was particularly affected due to its monopoly positions regarding many exports. Credit was obtained to weather the deficits, but eventually the debt would grow to unmanageable levels. Foreign business interests increasingly exercised control over domestic commerce. Foreign trade proved to be a Trojan Horse.Lucette Valensi, Le Magheb avang la prise d'Alger (Paris 1969), translated as On the Eve of Colonialism: North Africa before the French conquest (New York: Africana 1977); cited by Perkins (1986) . Under the French Protectorate (1881‚Äì1956) the Husaynid Beys continued in a largely ceremonial r√¥le. Following independence, a republic was declared in 1957; the Beylical office was terminated and the Husaynid dynasty came to an end. =Era of Reform= In the 19th century under the Husaynid Beyds, commerce with the Europeans increased, with permanent residences established by many foreign merchants. In 1819 the Bey agreed to quit corsair raids. In 1830 the Bey also agreed to enforce in Tunisia the capitulation treaties between the Ottomans and various European powers, under which European consuls would act as judges in legal cases involving their nationals. During 1830 the French royal army occupied neighboring Algeria. Ahmad Bey (1837‚Äì1855) assumed the throne during this complex situation. Following the examples of the Ottoman Empire under sultan Mahmud II, and of Egypt under Muhammad Ali, he moved to intensify a program to update and upgrade the Tunisian armed forces. In pursuit of this policy, he instituted a military school and started industries in order to supply its more modern army and navy. In a major step, he initiated the recruitment and conscription of native Tunisians to serve in the army and navy, a step which would reduce the long division between the state and its citizens. Yet the resulting tax increases were not popular.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) pp. 69-72. Although desiring Ottoman support, repeatedly Ahmad Bey refused to apply in Tunisia the Ottoman legal reforms regarding citizen rights, i.e., the Tanzimat of 1839. Instead, he instituted progressive laws of his own, showing native Tunisian authority in the modernizing project and hence the redundancy of importing any Ottoman reforms. The Slave trade was abolished in 1841, slavery in 1846. Yet these legal reforms had limited application to many Tunisians. Ahmad Bey continued the general Beylical policy, i.e., to decline or reject political attachment to the Ottoman state, but welcome religious ties to the Ottoman Caliphate.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971) pp. 259‚Äì275.Perkins, Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds (1986) p. 72. As part of his maneuvering to maintain Tunisia's sovereignty, Ahmad Bey sent 4,000 Tunisian troops against the Russian Empire during the Crimean War (1854‚Äì1856). In doing so he allied Tunisia with Turkey, France, and Britain.Robert Rinehart, \\"Historical Setting\\" 1‚Äì70, p. 27, in Tunisia. A country study (3rd ed., 1987). Modernity and the French Protectorate As the 19th century commenced, the country remained quasi-autonomous, although officially still an Ottoman province. Trade with Europe increased dramatically with western merchants arriving to establish businesses in the country. In 1861, Tunisia enacted the first constitution in the Arab world, but a move toward a modernizing republic was hampered by the poor economy and by political unrest. Loans made by foreigners to the government were becoming difficult to manage. In 1869, Tunisia declared itself bankrupt; an international financial commission, with representatives from France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, took control over the economy. Initially, Italy was the country that demonstrated the most desire to have Tunisia as a colony having investment, citizens and geographic proximity as motivation. However this was rebuffed when Britain and France co-operated to prevent this during the years 1871 ‚Äì 1878 ending in Britain supporting French influence in Tunisia in exchange for dominion over Cyprus. France still had the issue of Italian influence (related to the huge colony of Tunisian Italians emigrated to TunisiaItalians in Tunisia (and Maghreb)) and thus decided to find an excuse for a pre-emptive strike. In the spring of 1881, the French army occupied Tunisia, claiming that Tunisian troops had crossed the border to Algeria, France's primary colony in Northern Africa. Italy, also interested in Tunisia, protested, but did not risk a war with France. On May 12 of that year, Tunisia was officially made a French protectorate with the signature of the treaty of Bardo (Al Qasr as Sa'id)by Muhammad III as-Sadiq.Cooley, Baal, Christ, and Mohammed. Religion and Revolution in North Africa (New York 1965) pp. 193‚Äì196; Richard M. Brace, Morocco Algeria Tunisia (Prentice-Hall 1964) pp. 36‚Äì37. This gave France control of Tunisian governance and making it a de facto French protectorate. France's colonial empire at the time of French rule in Tunisia. The French progressively assumed more of the important administrative positions, and by 1884 they supervised all Tunisian government bureaus dealing with finance, post, education, telegraph, public works and agriculture. They decided to guarantee the Tunisian debt, and then abolished the international finance commission. French settlements in the country were actively encouraged; the number of French colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945, occupying approximately one-fifth of the cultivated land. Roads, ports, railroads, and mines were developed. In rural areas the French administration strengthened the local officials (qa'ids) and weakened the independent tribes. An additional judicial system was established for Europeans but available generally, set up without interfering with the existing Sharia courts, available as always for the legal matters of Tunisians. Map of Tunisia in 1902 with numerous railroads Many welcomed the progressive changes, but preferred to manage their own affairs. Kayr al-Din in the 1860s and 1870s had introduced modernizing reforms before the French occupation. Some of his companions later founded the weekly magazine al-Hadira in 1888. A more radical one al-Zahra ran from 1890 until suppressed in 1896; as was the Sabil al-Rashad of 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Tha'alibi, who was inspired by Muhammad 'Abduh of Cairo, among others. Bashir Sfar initiated the discussion group Khalduniya in 1896. 'Ali Bash Hamba founded the French language journal Tunisien to inform the French public of the Tunisian complaints, but only increased unrest. Tha'alibi founded the Arabic language Tunisien in 1909, to challenge Hamba from a Tunisian view point. In 1911 there were civil disturbances started within the universities. Hamba and Tha'alibi came together. A political party was begun, al-Ittihad al-Islami [Islamic Unity], which had pro-Ottoman leanings. Issues concerning a Muslim cemetery, the Jallaz, sparked large demonstrations which ended with martial law and the killing of many Tunisians in late 1911. Further demonstrations in 1912 led to the closing of the nationalist newspapers and the exiling of nationalist leadership.Laroui, History of Maghrib pp. 314‚Äì315, 353, 357‚Äì361. Organized nationalist sentiment among Tunisians, driven underground in 1912, resurfaced after the great War. Encouragement came from many directions, e.g., the formation of the League of Nations in 1919. Nationalists established the Destour [Constitution] Party in 1920. Habib Bourguiba established and led its successor, the Neo-Destour Party, in 1934. French authorities later banned this new party, while the fascist organizations of the Tunisian Italians supported it (Mussolini obtained the liberation of Bourghiba from a Vichy jail in 1942). During World War II, the French authorities in Tunisia supported the Vichy government which ruled France after its capitulation to Germany in 1940. After initial victories to the east the German General Erwin Rommel,Rommel later joined the German military's plot to kill Hitler; Rommel's preference was to arrest him and try him for war crimes. Wm. L. Shirer, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich (New York 1960) pp. 1030‚Äì1032. lacking supplies and reinforcements, in 1942 lost the decisive battle of al-Alamein (near Alexandria in Egypt) to the British General Bernard Montgomery. After learning of Allied landings in the west (Operation Torch), the Axis army retreated westward to Tunisia and set up defensive positions. The British following on his heels eventually broke these lines, although Rommel did have some early success against the \\"green\\" American troops advancing from the west, until the arrival of General George Patton who stopped Rommel in battle. The fighting ended in May 1943. The German Afrika Corps surrendered on May 11. Two days later, on May 13, after the collapse of the 5th German Tank Army, the fall of Tunis and the surrounding of the 1st Italian Army, still holding the line at Enfidaville, the Italian general Messe formally surrendered to the Allies. General Eisenhower (who earned trust by talking straight if not always clearly) stated at \\"far from governing a conquered country, we were attempting only to force a gradual widening of the base of government, with the final objective of turning all internal affairs over to popular control.\\" Tunisia became a staging area for operations in the invasion of Sicily later at year.Dwight D. Eisenhower, Crusade in Europe (New York 1948) p. 137; Wm. L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich pp. 912‚Äì913. Map of modern Tunisia. After World War II, the struggle for national independence continued and intensified. The Neo-Destour Party reemerged under Habib Bourguiba. Yet with a lack of progress, violent resistance to French rule began in the mountains during 1954. The Tunisians coordinated with independence movements in Algeria and Morocco, although it was Tunisia that first became independent. Ultimately, the Neo-Destour Party managed to gain sovereignty for its people by maneuver and finesse.Richard M. Brace, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia (Prentice-Hall 1964) pp. 39‚Äì52, 95‚Äì97. Tunisian Republic Independence from France was achieved on March 20, 1956. The State was established as a constitutional monarchy with the Bey of Tunis, Muhammad VIII al-Amin Bey, as the king of Tunisia. =The Era of Habib Bourguiba= In 1957, the Prime Minister Habib Bourguiba (Habib Abu Ruqaiba) abolished the monarchy and firmly established his Neo Destour (New Constitution) party. The regime sought to run a strictly structured regime with efficient and equitable state operations, but not democratic-style politics. Also terminated was the bey, a quasi-monarchist institution dating back to Ottoman rule. Then Bourguiba commenced to dominate the country for the next 31 years, governing with thoughtful programs yielding stability and economic progress, repressing Islamic fundamentalism, and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation.Brace, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia (1964) p. 142. The vision at Bourguiba offered was of a Tunisian republic. The political culture would be secular, populist, and imbued with a kind of French rationalist vision of the state at was buoyant, touched with √©lan, Napoleonic in spirit. Bourguiba then saw an idiosyncratic, eclectic future combining tradition and innovation, Islam with a liberal prosperity.Habib Bourguiba has been compared to Atat√ºrk (Mustafa Kemal) of Turkey, as a unique national modernizing leader. Yet, what may be called an inclination to arbitrary methods when making government decisions, and to a specie of personality cult, detracted from Bourguiba's insight and substantial achievements. Perkins, A History of Modern Tunisia (2004), e.g., pp. 130, 204‚Äì209. \\"Bourguibism\\" was also resolutely nonmilitarist, arguing that Tunisia could never be a credible military power and that the building of a large military establishment would only consume scarce investment resources and perhaps thrust Tunisia into the cycles of military intervention in politics at had plagued the rest of the Middle East. In the name of economic development, Bourguiba nationalized various religious land holdings and dismantled several religious institutions.On the other hand, Bourguiba also negotiated with the Catholic Church; as a result Tunisia received scores of churches and land parcels to be used for libraries or museums, and the right to be consulted in the naming of future Church leaders. John K. Cooley, Baal, Christ, and Mohammad. Religion and Revolution in North Africa (Holt Rinehart Winston 1965) pp. 3‚Äì5, 297‚Äì298. Bourguiba's great asset was at \\"Tunisia possessed a mature nationalist organization, the Neo Destour Party, which on independence day held the nation's confidence in hand.\\" It had made its case to the city workers in the modern economy and to country folk in the traditional economy; it had excellent leaders who commanded respect and who generally developed reasonable government programs.Brace, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia (1964) p. 141. In July 1961, when Tunisia imposed a blockade on the French naval base at Bizerte, hoping to force its evacuation, the crisis culminated in a three-day battle between French and Tunisian forces that left some 630 Tunisians and 24 French dead and eventually led to France ceding the city and naval base to Tunisia in 1963. One a serious rival to Habib Bourguiba was Salah Ben Yusuf. Exiled in Cairo during the early 1950s he had absorbed the pan-Arab nationalism associated with the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdul Nasser. Yet as a result of his strong opposition to the Neo Destour leadership during their negotiations with France for autonomy prior to independence, Ben Youssef was removed from his position as secretary-general and expelled from the party. Nonetheless he rallied disaffected union members, students, and others, enough to put 20,000 yusufists into the street during the next congress of the Neo Destour party. Eventually he left Tunisia for Cairo.Perkins, A History of Modern Tunisia (Cambridge Univ. 2004) pp. 117‚Äì118, 128‚Äì129.Ben Yusuf was assassinated in Egypt in 1961. Brace, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia (1964) pp. 115‚Äì116, 142.After 1987, Ben Yusuf was gradually \\"rehabilitated\\" and his body returned to Tunisia for burial. Perkins, A History of Modern Tunisia (Cambridge Univ. 2004) pp. 199‚Äì201. Socialism was not initially a major part of the Neo Destour project, but the government had always held and implemented redistributive policies. A large public works program was launched in 1961.Brace, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia (1964) pp. 146‚Äì147. Nonetheless in 1964, Tunisia entered a short lived socialist era. The Neo Destour party became the Socialist Destour (Parti Socialiste Dusturien or PSD), and the new minister of planning, Ahmed Ben Salah, formulated a state-led plan for agricultural cooperatives and public- sector industrialization. The socialist experiment raised considerable opposition within Bourguiba's old coalition. Ahmed Ben Salah was eventually dismissed in 1970, and many socialized operations (e.g., the farm cooperatives) were returned to private ownership in the early 1970s.Moncef M. Khaddar, \\"Tunisia\\" pp. 848‚Äì850, 849, in Joel Krieger (ed.), Oxford Companion to Politics of the World (2001). In 1978, a general strike was repressed by the government with its forces killing dozens; union leaders were jailed. After independence, Tunsian economic policy had been primarily to promote light industry and tourism, and develop its phosphate deposits. The major sector remained agriculture with small farms prevailing, but these did not produce well. In the early 1960s the economy slowed down, but the socialist program did not prove to be the cure. In the 1970s the economy of Tunisia expanded at a very healthy rate. Oil was discovered, and tourism continued. City and countryside populations drew roughly equal in number. Yet agricultural problems and urban unemployment led to increased migration to Europe. =The Era of Ben Ali= In the 1980s the economy performed poorly. In 1983 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forced the government to raise the price of bread and semolina, causing severe hardship and protest riots. In this situation, the Islamic Tendency Movement (MTI) under Cheikh Rached el- Ghannouchi provided popular leadership. Civil disturbances, including those by the Islamists, were repressed by government security forces under General Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The government persisted in following its program; Ben Ali was named prime minister. The 84-year-old President Bourguiba was overthrown and replaced by Ben Ali his Prime Minister on November 7, 1987.John P. Entelis, \\"Tunisia\\" pp. 532‚Äì533 in The Americana Annual 1988 (New York: Grolier). Ben Ali's background was said to be pro-Western, trained in military affairs by France and the U.S.A.; he had previously clamped down on both left and right opponents, especially Islamic fundamentalists. Ninety fundamentalist had been found guilty of bombing hotels earlier in 1987. Entelis (1987) pp. 532‚Äì533. The new president changed very little in the Bourguibist political support system, except to rename the party the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD by its French acronym). In 1988, Ben Ali tried a new tack with reference to the government and Islam, by attempting to reaffirm the country's Islamic identity; several Islamist activists were released from prison. He also forged a national pact with the Tunisian party Harakat al-Ittijah al-Islami (Islamic Tendency Movement), which had been founded in 1981; later it changed its name to an-Nahda (the Renaissance Party). But Ben Ali's innovative tack did not work out. Subsequently, An-Nahda claimed to have run strongly in the 1989 elections, which gave the appearance of being unfair; reports often described pro-government votes at over 90%. Ben Ali subsequently banned Islamist political parties and jailed as many as 8,000 activists. In 2004, Ben Ali was re-elected President for a five-year term, with a reported 94.5% of the vote. Also elected were 189 members of the Majlis al-Nuwaab or Chamber of Deputies, with a five-year term. In addition, there was a Chamber of Advisors composed of 126 members with six-year terms, of whom 85 were elected by government subdivisions (e.g., municipalities), by professional associations, and by trade unions (14 union members boycotted the process); the remaining 41 members were appointed by the President. The court system remained a combination of French Civil Law and Islamic Sharia Law.The World Factbook on \\"Tunisia\\" A widely supported human rights movement emerged, which included not only Islamists but also trade unionists, lawyers and journalists. Tunisia's political institutions, however, remained fixed in the authoritarian past. As of 2001, the government's response to calls for reform Included house arrests and prison. The government continued its refusal to recognize Muslim opposition parties, and governed the country in a political climate considered rigid, from time to time using objectionable military and police measures to repress dissent. In foreign affairs, Tunisia continued to enjoy close ties to the West while broadly following a moderate, non-aligned stance. The Arab League was headquartered in Tunis from 1979 to 1991. =2000s in Tunisia= Tunis, the capital, has a population of about 700,000, and the second city of Sfax approximately 250,000. The population growth rate measured as births per female has fallen from 7 (1960s) to 2 (2007). Life expectancy is female 75, male 72. The religion is Muslim (98%), with 1% Christian, and 1% Jewish and other. Required education is eight years. The official language is Arabic, with French also spoken particularly in commercial dealings, and with less than 2% Berber. Literacy by definition includes all over 15 years, and is overall 74%, male 83% and female 65%. In 2006, 7.3 million mobile phones were in use and 1.3 million were on the internet; there were 26 television stations and 29 radio stations. Over half the population is considered urban, with agricultural workers being about 30% of the total. Unemployment in 2000 was about 15.6%, and in 2006 about 13.9%. Over 300,000 Tunisians were reported to be residing in France during 1994.Alfred Hermida, \\"Tunisia\\" pp. 544‚Äì545 in The Americana Annual 1994 (New York: Grolier); Rose Ryan, \\"Tunisia\\" p. 548 in The Americana Annual 2000 (NY: Grolier). Left out of the recent prosperity were many rural and urban poor, including small businesses facing the world market. The monetary unit is the dinar, at about 1.33 per dollar U.S.A. (recently a fairly constant rate), with inflation estimated pp. 4.5% for 2006. Tunisia's per capita annual income was approximately 8,900 dollars (U.S.A.) in 2006. Between 1988 and 1998 the economy more than doubled. The economy grew at 5% per year during the 1990s (the best in Northwest Africa), but hit a 15-year low of 1.9% in 2002 (due to drought and a decline in tourism), but it regained a 5% rate for 2003‚Äì2005; it was said to be 4%‚Äì5% for 2006. Tunisia's economy is diverse. Its products are primarily from light industry (food processing, textiles, footwear, agribusiness, mining commodities, construction materials) and from agriculture (olives, olive oil, grains (wheat and barley), tomatoes, citrus, sugar beets, dates, almonds, figs, vegetables, grapes, beef dairy), as well as livestock (sheep, goats) and fishing. Other production comes from petroleum and mining (phosphates, iron, oil, lead, zinc, salt). Tunisia is self-sufficient in oil, but not in natural gas. A very significant portion of the economy derives from the tourist industry.Rose Ryan, \\"Tunisia\\" p. 548 in The Americana Annual 2000 (NY: Grolier); by 2000 four million tourists were visiting each year, generating 4.7% of Tunisia's Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.). Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.) was composed of approximately 12.5% agriculture, 33.1% industry, and 54.4% services. Exports went to France 29%, Italy 20%, Germany 9%, Spain 6%, Libya 5%, U.S.A. 4%. Imports came from France 25%, Italy 22%, Germany 10%, Spain 5%. An association agreement with the European Union will move Tunisia toward full free trade with the EU by 2008. The face of the countryside changes markedly as one moves from north to south. In the north and central coast, orchards and fields predominate; while in the central plains, pasturage. Overall, arable land is 17%‚Äì19%, with forest and woodland 4%, permanent crops 13%, irrigated lands at2.4%; about 20% is used for pasture. There are limited fresh water resources. In the south the environment grows increasingly arid, until the borderlands eventually reach into the Sahara desert. Roads total about 20,000 km., two-thirds being paved, with most of the unpaved roads lying in the desert south. The 'Dignity Revolution' The Ben Ali regime came to an end following nationwide demonstrations precipitated by high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of political freedoms like freedom of speech and poor living conditions. The protests constituted the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades and resulted in scores of deaths and injuries, most of which were the result of action by police and security forces against demonstrators. The protests were sparked by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi on 17 December 2010Tunisia suicide protester Mohammed Bouazizi dies, BBC, 5 January 2011. and led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 28 days later on 14 January 2011, when he officially resigned after fleeing to Saudi Arabia, ending 23 years in power. In the Western media, these events were commonly named the Jasmine Revolution, but the name was not generally adopted in Tunisia itself. where the name generally used is the Dignity Revolution () ('). Following the overthrow of Ben Ali, Tunisians elected a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution, and an interim government known as the Troika because it was a coalition of three parties; the Islamist Ennahda Movement in the lead, with the centre-left Congress for the Republic and the left-leaning Ettakatol as minority partners. Widespread discontent remained however, leading to the 2013‚Äì14 Tunisian political crisis. As a result of the efforts made by the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet, the Constituent Assembly completed its work, the interim government resigned, and new elections were held in 2014, completing the transition to a democratic state. The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet was awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for \\"its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Tunisian Revolution of 2011\\".

Between 1956 and 2011, Tunisia operated as a de facto one-party state, with politics dominated by the secular Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD) under former Presidents Habib Bourguiba and then Zine el Abidine Ben Ali. However, in 2011 a national uprising led to the ousting of the President and the dismantling of the RCD, paving the way for a multi-party democracy. October 2014 saw the first democratic parliamentary elections since the 2011 revolution, resulting in a win by the secularist Nidaa Tounes party with 85 seats in the 217-member assembly.\\"Secularist Nidaa Tounes party wins Tunisia election\\" BBC, 2014 Tunisia is a member of the Arab League, the African Union and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. It maintains close relations with the United States, France and the European Union, with which it entered an Association Agreement in 1995.European Union Association Agreement, Ministry of Development and International Cooperation, 2009. Tunisia's favorable relations with the United States and the European Union were earned following years of successful economic cooperation in the private sector and infrastructure modernization.\\"Tunisian Partnership with Europe\\" Defense Technical Information Center, 2004 putting it in the same category as the United States and South Korea. Tunisia is considered the only democracy in the Arab world. Structure of government Tunisia is a representative democracy with an executive president, a legislature and judiciary. The military is neutral and does not play any role in national politics. =Executive branch= In Tunisia, the President is elected for five-year terms. After the election, the President nominates the candidate of the party which gained the most votes to form a government within a month. The nominee must submit its program to the Assembly of the Representatives of the People and get the trust of the majority of its members before being formally appointed the Head of Government by the President. Regional governors and local administrators also are appointed by the central government. Mayors and municipal councils are elected. =Legislative branch= Tunisia's legislative branch consists of the Assembly of the Representatives of the People, with 217 seats. The first elections for the Assembly of the Representative of the People occurred on 26 October 2014. Before the 2011 revolution the parliament was bicameral. The lower house of the bicameral Parliament was the Chamber of Deputies of Tunisia (Majlis al- Nuwaab), which had 214 seats. Members were elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms. At least 25% of the seats in the House of Deputies were reserved for the opposition. More than 27% of the members of the Chamber of Deputies were women. The Lower House played a growing role as an arena for debate on national policy especially as it hosted representatives from six opposition parties. Opposition members often voted against bills or abstained. Because of the comfortable majority enjoyed by the governing party, bills usually passed with only minor changes.The Council of Deputies, Republic of Tunisia. The upper house was the Chamber of Advisors, which included 112 members including representatives of governorates (provinces), professional organizations and national figures. 41 members were appointed by the Head of state while the remainder were elected by their peers. About 15% of the members of the Chamber of advisors were women.Chamber of Advisers =Judicial branch= The Tunisian legal system is based on French civil law system; some judicial review of legislative acts takes place in the Supreme Court in joint session. The judiciary is independent, although the judicial council is chaired by the head of state. With regard to the legal profession, the Tunisian Order of Lawyers is a non-profit bar association. All Tunisian lawyers are members of the Order, which does not have any political affiliations. Political parties and elections Since 1987 Tunisia has reformed its political system several times, abolishing life-term presidencies and opening up the parliament to opposition parties. The number of new political parties and associations has increased since the beginning of Ben Ali's presidency in 1987. Shortly before the revolution of 2011 there were eight recognized national parties, six of which held national legislative seats. President Ben Ali's party, known as the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), commanded majorities in local, regional, and national elections. Although the party was renamed (in President Bourguiba‚Äôs days it was the Socialist Destourian Party), its policies were still considered to be largely secular and conservative. However, the Tunisian Revolution in 2011 saw its removal from power. =2009 national elections= The Tunisian national elections of 2009, overseen by the Interior Ministry and held on October 25, 2009, elected candidates for president and legislative offices. During the campaign, speeches by candidates were aired on Tunisian radio and television stations.Tunisian candidates kick off campaigns, Magharebia.com, 2009. Participation was 89% of resident citizens and 90% of citizens living abroad. In the presidential vote, Ben Ali soundly defeated his challengers, Mohamed Bouchiha (PUP), Ahmed Inoubli (UDU) and Ahmed Ibrahim (Ettajdid Movement) for a fifth term in office. His 89% of the vote was slightly lower than in the 2004 election.Results of presidential elections, TunisiaOnline.com, 25 October 2004. In the parliamentary elections, the RCD received 84% of the vote for 161 constituency seats. The MDS won 16 seats under the proportional representation system, followed by the PUP with 12 seats. 59 women were elected to legislative seats.\\"Final Results for the 2009 Legislative Elections\\" Republic of Tunisia: National Observatory of Presidential and Legislative Elections, 2009 The election was criticized by opposition parties and some international observers for limitations placed on non-incumbents.

During the period of the French Protectorate (1881‚Äì1956) Tunisians were recruited in significant numbers into the French Army, serving as tirailleurs (infantry) and spahis (cavalry). These units saw active service in Europe during both World Wars, as well as in Indo-China prior to 1954. The only exclusively Tunisian military force permitted under French rule was the Beylical Guard.page 710 \\"World Armies\\", John Keegan, = Following independence = On June 30, 1956, the Tunisian army was officially founded by decree, in the form of a combined-arms regiment. The necessary equipment was made available to the young state from French stocks. [Ridha Kefi http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN13076leshaemrale0 , \\"The army 's new clothes \\", Jeune Afrique, July 13, 1999] The new army initially comprised 25 Tunisian officers, 250 NCOs and 1,250 men transferred from French Army service, plus 850 former members of the Beylical Guard. Approximately 4,000 Tunisian soldiers continued in French Army service until 1958, when the majority transferred to the Tunisian Army, which reached a strength of over 6,000 that year. Intakes of conscripts for military service, made mandatory in January 1957, plus the recall of reservists allowed the army to grow to twelve battalions numbering 20,000 men by 1961. Sixty per cent of those troops were deployed for border monitoring and defense duties. Tunisian units first saw action in 1958 after French intrusions into the south in pursuit of National Liberation Army (Algeria) fighters. In 1960 Tunisian troops served with the United National Peacekeeping Force in the Congo. 1,020 troops from the Tunisian Armed Forces were amongst the first UN troops to arrive in the Congo, by 20 July 1960. In 1961 clashes occurred with French forces based at Bizerte. More than 600 men fell in battle against the French forces. The French evacuated the base after subsequent negotiations with the Tunisian Government. The Tunisian Navy, founded in 1958, received its first ship in the fall of 1959. The Air Force acquired its first combat aircraft in 1960 . While the Tunisian armed forces obtain equipment from several sources, the United States remains the largest single supplier. Officer and specialist training for Tunisian personnel was formerly undertaken in French and American military academies. Tunisian trainees are now gradually being assigned to newly established military schools within the country. The January 10, 1957, a law prohibits any military officer to be a member of a group or a political party.

General Staff In accordance with Article 44 of the constitution, the supreme commander of the armed forces is the President of the Republic of Tunisia. In December 2010, the staff is composed as follows: Chief of Staff of the Army corps is the General Rashid Ammar, one of the Air Force is Brigadier General Taieb Lajimi and that the navy is Rear Admiral Mohamed Khamassi. In April 2011, Ammar became chief of staff inter-armed. The Inspector General of the armed forces is Rear Admiral Tarek Faouzi Larbi, the Director of Military Engineering is Brigadier General Mohammed Hedi Abdelkafi and the director of military security Brigadier General Ahmed Chabir. Tunisian Army The Tunisian Army is 80,000 strong and is composed essentially of: * three mechanised brigades bas√©d at Kairouan (3rd), Gab√®s (1st) and B√©ja (2nd). Each is composed of:  one armoured r√©giment (M60 Patton tanks)  two regiments of mechanised infantry (M113 armoured personnel carriers) (11th-17th Mechanised Infantry Regiments have been reported)  one artillery regiment (M198 howitzer)  one reconnaissance company (AML 90) * one Saharan territorial group at Borj el-Khadra and Remada, consisting of two light infantry regiments * one special forces group (Groupe des Forces Sp√©ciales) * one military police r√©giment Air Force equipment Admiral Edmund P.

The Tunisian Air Force is equipped with 10 Northrop F-5E Tiger II and two Northrop F-5F Tiger II. These form 15 Squadron at Bizerte-Sidi Ahmed Air Base. It also includes 12 Aero L-59T, as well as three Aermacchi MB-326K (combat capable) as well as 4 MB-326B, and 3 MB326L. Previously up to 8 Aermacchi MB-326B, 7-16 Aermacchi MB-326KT, and 4 Aermacchi MB-326LT were in service. The IISS Military Balance 2013 lists six Lockheed C-130B Hercules, one Lockheed C-130H Hercules, five G-222s, three Let L-410UVP Turbolet (all assigned to one transport squadron) plus a liaison unit with two S-208A. Other reported transport aircraft include one Boeing 737-700/BBJ, two Dassault Falcon 20, and two Lockheed C-130J-30 Super Hercules. Reported attack helicopters include four Hughes MD 500 Defenders, and 7-8 SNIAS SA-342 Gazelle. Reported training/COIN and liaison aircraft include 12 SIAI Marchetti SF.260WC Warriors and 9 SIAI-Marchetti SF-260C, as well as 4 SIAI-Marchetti S.208A/M and one Reims F406.

Moments later, the ship was commissioned by the Tunisian Navy as the President Bourgiba.Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, Thomas J. Gary In the mid-1980s the force included President Bourguiba, two United States-built coastal minesweepers, and a variety of fast-attack and patrol craft. The most important additions to the fleet in the 1980s were three La Combattante III class fast attack craft armed with Exocet surface-to-surface missiles. Apart from these vessels, however, most of the fleet's units were old and capable of little more than coastal patrol duties. During the 1960s and 1970s the navy was primarily involved in combating the smuggling of contraband, the illegal entry of un- desirable aliens, and unauthorized emigration as well as other coastal security activities. In these matters the overall effort was shared with agencies of the Ministry of Interior, especially the customs agents and immigration personnel of the Surete Nationale. President Bourgiba suffered a major fire on 16 April 1992 and later left operational service. Today the Tunisian Navy reportedly has bases at Bizerte, Kelibia, La Goulette, and Sfax. Formerly reported in service were six Kondor-II class minsweepers of 635 tons, equipped with 3 twin 25mm Guns. However none were listed in service by the IISS Military Balance 2013. Also formerly in use were MBDA MM-40 Exocet and Nord SS-12M surface-to-surface missiles.

But since the 2011 popular revolt, many journalists have enjoyed new-found freedoms. The number of radio and TV channels and print publications has increased, as has their freedom to report and debate political and social issues. State TV, which had toed the government line, has changed tack, giving airtime to the former opposition. Prior to the Tunisian revolution there were four private radio stations operating in Tunisia. In June 2011, following the Tunisian revolution, a recommendation to license twelve new private radio stations was forwarded to the interim Prime Minister. In August 2011 none of the recommendations had been acted upon. However, several stations began broadcasting under time- limited provisional licenses. The stations operate without specific operating rules because a new regulatory framework is not yet in place.\\"New Private Radios: Authorized but still Voiceless\\", Latifa Al-Mekbali, 27 August 2011\\"Tunisia: The hijacking of free radio\\", Sana Sbouai, Nawaat, 17 July 2012 In part due to the lack of a regulatory framework the government's National Office of Broadcasting (ONT) requires broadcasters to pay a licensing fee of 120,000 dinars (approximately $75,000), and while that license is not necessary to broadcast, it confers a certain amount of legitimacy that broadcasters need to draw advertisers. The large fee is difficult for new start-up stations and the new stations feel that the fees provide an unfair advantage for the older more established private groups organized under the previous regime.\\"Emerging from the Underground, Pirate Radio Seeks Acceptance\\", Paul Rosenfeld, Tunisia Live, 14 November 2012 Internet *Top level domain (TLD): .tn *Access: Available throughout the country using a fibre-optic backbone\\"Tunisia - Telecoms, Mobile, Broadband and Forecasts\\", Budde.com.au, accessed 21 October 2011 *Internet Service Providers (ISPs): 12 (2005) *International bandwidth: 62 Gbit/s in 2012, 50 Gbit/s in 2010, 1.3 Gbit/s in 2006\\"Capacity of International Internet Bandwidth\\", Tunisian Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies, retrieved 20 February 2013 *Internet users: 4,196,564 (2012),\\"Tunisia\\", Internet World Stats, accessed 20 February 2013 840,000 (2005); 410,000 (2001) *Internet penetration: 39.1% (2011), 36.8% (2010), 17.1% (2007), 9.7% (2005), 2.8% (2000)\\"Percentage of Individuals using the Internet 2000-2011\\", spreadsheet, International Telecommunications Unions (ITU), Geneva, 2011 *Fixed (wired) Internet subscriptions: 604,102 (2011); 543,290 (2010); 253,149 (2007); 150,220 (2005); 36,657 (2000)\\"Fixed (wired)-Internet subscriptions 2000-2011\\", spreadsheet, International Telecommunications Unions (ITU), Geneva, 2011 *Broadband Internet subscribers: 544,392 or 5.1% (2011),\\"Fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions 2000-2011\\", spreadsheet, International Telecommunications Unions (ITU), Geneva, 2011 481,810 or 4.6% (2010),\\"Key Global Telecom Indicators for the World Telecommunication Service Sector\\", International Telecommunications Unions (ITU), Geneva, 2011 372,818 or 3.6% (2009), 43,845 or 0.4% (2006)\\"Tunisia - fixed broadband internet subscribers\\", Index Mundi, accessed 21 October 2011 *Facebook subscribers: 2,602,640 (2011) *Facebook penetration: 24.5% (2011) *Public CyberCaf√©s: 350 (2005) Information and communications technology The Tunisian government considers information and communications technology (ICT) an important tool to boost the country's economy and to adapt the education system to the opportunities available from using Information Technology (IT) as a tool.

Originating in the Bayan Har Mountains in Qinghai province of Western China, it flows through nine provinces, and it empties into the Bohai Sea near the city of Dongying in Shandong province. The Yellow River basin has an east‚Äìwest extent of about and a north‚Äìsouth extent of about . Its total drainage area is about . Its basin was the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization, and it was the most prosperous region in early Chinese history. There are frequent devastating floods and course changes produced by the continual elevation of the river bed, sometimes above the level of its surrounding farm fields.  Name  Early Chinese literature including the Yu Gong or Tribute of Yu dating to the Warring States period (475‚Äì221 BC) refers to the Yellow River as simply (Old Chinese: *C.gÀ§aj,Baxter, Wm. H. & Sagart, Laurent. , p. 41. 2011. Accessed 11 October 2011. modern Chinese (Pinyin) H√©), a character that has come to mean \\"river\\" in modern usage. The first appearance of the name (Old Chinese: *N-k ∑À§a≈ã C.gÀ§aj; Middle Chinese: Huang Ha) is in the Book of Han written during the Eastern Han dynasty about the Western Han dynasty. The adjective \\"yellow\\" describes the perennial color of the muddy water in the lower course of the river, which arises from soil (loess) being carried downstream. One of its older Mongolian names was the \\"Black River\\",Parker, Edward H. China: Her History, Diplomacy, and Commerce, from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, p. 11.

In Mongolia itself, it is simply called the ≈†ar M√∂r√∂n (, \\"Yellow River\\"). In Qinghai, the river's Tibetan name is \\"River of the Peacock\\" (; ) History = Dynamics = Ma Yuan (1160‚Äì1225), Song dynasty The Yellow River is one of several rivers that are essential for China's existence. At the same time, however, it has been responsible for several deadly floods, including the only natural disasters in recorded history to have killed more than a million people. Among the deadliest were the 1332‚Äì33 flood during the Yuan dynasty, the 1887 flood during the Qing dynasty which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a Republic of China era 1931 flood (part of a massive number of floods that year) that killed 1‚Äì4 million people. The cause of the floods is the large amount of fine-grained loess carried by the river from the Loess Plateau, which is continuously deposited along the bottom of its channel. The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams were unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water has to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the path of least resistance. When this happens, it bursts out across the flat North China Plain, sometimes taking a new channel and inundating any farmland, cities or towns in its path. The traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher levees along the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river's mouth to shift as much as , sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of Shandong Peninsula and sometimes to the south.Gascoigne, Bamber and Gascoigne, Christina (2003) The Dynasties of China, Perseus Books Group, Another historical source of devastating floods is the collapse of upstream ice dams in Inner Mongolia with an accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.The Ice Bombers Move Against Mongolia. strategypage.com (29 March 2011) Before modern dams came to China, the Yellow River used to be extremely prone to flooding. In the 2,540 years from 595 BC to 1946 AD, the Yellow River has been reckoned to have flooded 1,593 times, shifting its course 26 times noticeably and nine times severely.Tregear, T. R. (1965) A Geography of China, pp. 218‚Äì219. These floods include some of the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded. Before modern disaster management, when floods occurred, some of the population might initially die from drowning but then many more would suffer from the ensuing famine and spread of diseases. =Ancient times= The Yellow River as depicted in a Qing dynasty illustrated map (sections) Historical courses of the Yellow River Historical courses of the Yellow River In Chinese mythology, the giant Kua Fu drained the Yellow River and the Wei River to quench his burning thirst as he pursued the Sun.Summary of the story given in the definition of : Historical documents from the Spring and Autumn periodGernet, Jacques.

These accounts show that after the river passed Luoyang, it flowed along the border between Shanxi and Henan Provinces, then continued along the border between Hebei and Shandong before emptying into Bohai Bay near present-day Tianjin. Another outlet followed essentially the present course. The river left these paths in 602 BC and shifted several hundred kilometers to the east. Sabotage of dikes, canals, and reservoirs and deliberate flooding of rival states became a standard military tactic during the Warring States period.Allaby, Michael & Garrat, Richard. Facts on File Dangerous Weather Series: Floods, p. 142. Infobase Pub., 2003. . Accessed 15 October 2011. As the Yellow River valley was the major entryway to the Guanzhong area and the state of Qin from the North China Plain, Qin heavily fortified the Hangu Pass; it saw numerous battles and was also an important chokepoint protecting the Han capitals of Chang'an and Luoyang. Major flooding in AD 11 is credited with the downfall of the short-lived Xin dynasty, and another flood in AD 70 returned the river north of Shandong on essentially its present course. =Medieval times= From around the beginning of the 3rd century, the importance of the Hangu Pass was reduced, with the major fortifications and military bases moved upriver to Tongguan. In AD 923, the desperate Later Liang general Duan Ning again broke the dikes, flooding in a failed attempt to protect his realm's capital from the Later Tang. A similar proposal from the Song engineer Li Chun concerning flooding the lower reaches of the river to protect the central plains from the Khitai was overruled in 1020: the Chanyuan Treaty between the two states had expressly forbidden the Song from establishing new moats or changing river courses.Elvin, Mark & Liu Cuirong (eds.) Studies in Environment and History: Sediments of Time: Environment and Society in Chinese History, pp. 554 ff. Cambridge Uni. Press, 1998. . Accessed 15 Oct. 2011. Breaches occurred regardless: one at Henglong in 1034 divided the course in three and repeatedly flooded the northern regions of Dezhou and Bozhou. The Song worked for five years futilely attempting to restore the previous courseusing over 35,000 employees, 100,000 conscripts, and 220,000 tons of wood and bamboo in a single yearbefore abandoning the project in 1041. The more sluggish river then occasioned a breach at Shanghu that sent the main outlet north towards Tianjin in 1048 In 1128, the Song troops breached the southern dikes of the Yellow River in an effort to stop the advancing Jin army. The resulting major river avulsion allowed the Yellow to capture tributaries of the Huai River. For the first time in recorded history, the Yellow River shifted completely south of Shandong Peninsula and flowed into the Yellow Sea. By 1194, the mouth of the Huai had been blocked.Grousset, Rene. The Rise and Splendour of the Chinese Empire, p. 303. University of California Press, 1959. The buildup of silt deposits was such that even after the Yellow River later shifted its course, the Huai could no longer flow along its historic course, but instead, its water pools into Hongze Lake and then runs southward toward the Yangtze River. A flood in 1344 returned the Yellow River south of Shandong. The Yuan dynasty was waning, and the emperor forced enormous teams to build new embankments for the river. The terrible conditions helped to fuel rebellions that led to the founding of the Ming dynasty. The course changed again in 1391 when the river flooded from Kaifeng to Fengyang in Anhui. It was finally stabilized by the eunuch Li Xing during the public works projects following the 1494 flood. The river flooded many times in the 16th century, including in 1526, 1534, 1558, and 1587. Each flood affected the river's lower course.Tsai, Shih-Shan Henry. SUNY Series in Chinese Local Studies: The Eunuchs in the Ming Dynasty. SUNY Press, 1996. , 9780791426876. Accessed 16 Oct 2012. The 1642 flood was man- made, caused by the attempt of the Ming governor of Kaifeng to use the river to destroy the peasant rebels under Li Zicheng who had been besieging the city for the past six months.Lorge, Peter Allan.

On 9 June 1938, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Nationalist troops under Chiang Kai-shek broke the levees holding back the river near the village of Huayuankou in Henan, causing what has been called by Canadian historian, Diana Lary, a \\"war-induced natural disaster\\". The goal of the operation was to stop the advancing Japanese troops by following a strategy of \\"using water as a substitute for soldiers\\" (yishui daibing). The 1938 flood of an area covering took some 500,000 to 900,000 Chinese lives, along with an unknown number of Japanese soldiers. The flood prevented the Japanese Army from taking Zhengzhou, on the southern bank of the Yellow River, but did not stop them from reaching their goal of capturing Wuhan, which was the temporary seat of the Chinese government and straddles the Yangtze River.Lary, Diana. \\"The Waters Covered the Earth: China's War-Induced Natural Disaster\\". Op. cit. in Selden, Mark & So, Alvin Y., eds. War and State Terrorism: The United States, Japan, and the Asia-Pacific in the Long Twentieth Century, pp. 143‚Äì170. Rowman & Littlefield, 2004 . Geography Zoig√™ County, Sichuan. Guide County, Qinghai in the Tibetan Plateau, upstream from the Loess Plateau. According to the China Exploration and Research Society, the source of the Yellow River is at 34¬∞ 29' 31.1\\" N, 96¬∞ 20' 24.6\\" E in the Bayan Har Mountains near the eastern edge of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The source tributaries drain into Gyaring Lake and Ngoring Lake on the western edge of Golog Prefecture high in the Bayan Har Mountains of Qinghai. In the Zoige Basin along the boundary with Gansu, the Yellow River loops northwest and then northeast before turning south, creating the \\"Ordos Loop\\", and then flows generally eastward across the North China Plain to the Gulf of Bohai, draining a basin of which nourishes 140 million people with drinking water and irrigation. The Yellow River passes through seven present-day provinces and two autonomous regions, namely (from west to east) Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong. Major cities along the present course of the Yellow River include (from west to east) Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Wuhai, Baotou, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Jinan. The current mouth of the Yellow River is located at Kenli County, Shandong. The river is commonly divided into three stages. These are roughly the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau, the Ordos Loop, and the North China Plain. However, different scholars have different opinions on how the three stages are divided. This article mainly adopts the division used by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission.Yellow River Conservancy Commission. Yellowriver.gov.cn. Retrieved on 2013-02-04. The Yellow River derived sediments have been transported out of the Bohai Sea, all way to the North Yellow Sea and South Yellow Sea, and formed a Distal Depocenter around the Shandong Peninsula. =Upper reaches= Near Xunhua, Qinghai. Liujiaxia, Gansu. The upper reaches of the Yellow River constitute a segment starting from its source in the Bayan Har Mountains and ending at Hekou Town (Togtoh County), Inner Mongolia just before it turns sharply to the south. This segment has a total length of and total basin area of , 51.4% of the total basin area. Along this length, the elevation of the Yellow River drops , with an average grade of 0.10%. The source section flows mainly through pastures, swamps, and knolls between the Bayan Har Mountains, and the Anemaqen (Amne Machin) Mountains in Qinghai. The river water is clear and flows steadily. Crystal clear lakes are characteristic of this section. The two main lakes along this section are Lake Gyaring (Zhaling) and Lake Ngoring (Eling), with capacities of 4.7 billion and 10.8 billion m3 (166 and 381 billion ft3), respectively. At elevations over ) above sea level they are the two largest plateau freshwater lakes nationwide. A significant amount of land in the Yellow River's source area has been designated as the Sanjiangyuan (\\"'Three Rivers' Sources\\") National Nature Reserve, to protect the source region of the Yellow River, the Yangtze, and the Mekong. Flowing east at the eastern edge of the Amne Machin Mountains, the Yellow River enters Maqu County in Gansu. Here, the river skirts through the high-altitude peat bog known as the Zoig√™ Wetlands and makes a sharp turn towards the northwest forming the border between Maqu and Zoig√™ County in Sichuan. Flowing now along the northern edge of Amne Machin, the river reenters Qinghai and gradually curves north towards the Longyang Gorge at Xinghai. The valley section stretches from Longyang Gorge in Qinghai to Qingtong Gorge in Gansu. Steep cliffs line both sides of the river. The water bed is narrow and the average drop is large, so the flow in this section is extremely turbulent and fast. There are 20 gorges in this section, the most famous of these being the Longyang, Jishi, Liujia, Bapan, and Qingtong gorges. The flow conditions in this section makes it the best location for hydroelectric plants. The Yellow River exits Qinghai for the second and final time in these gorges and enters Gansu for the second time just before Liujia Gorge. Downstream from the Yanguo Gorge, the provincial capital of Lanzhou is built upon the Yellow River's banks. The Yellow River flows northeasterly out of Gansu and into Ningxia before the Qingtong Gorge. After emerging from the Qingtong Gorge, the river comes into a section of vast alluvial plains, the Yinchuan Plain and Hetao Plain. In this section, the regions along the river are mostly deserts and grasslands, with very few tributaries. The flow is slow. The Hetao Plain has a length of and width of . It is historically the most important irrigation plain along the Yellow River. =Middle reaches= At Lanzhou, Gansu At Shapotou, Ningxia Qiankun bend in Yonghe County At Luoyang, Henan The Ordos Loop formed by an enormous twist of the Yellow River, beginning at Zhongning County in Ningxia and ending with a drastic eastward turn at its confluence with the Wei at Tongguan in Shaanxi. However, the official division for the middle reaches of the river run from Hekou in Togtoh County, Inner Mongolia, to Zhengzhou, Henan. The middle reaches are long, with a basin area of , 45.7% of the total, with a total elevation drop of , an average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage. The middle reaches contribute 92% of the river's silts. The middle stream of the Yellow River passes through the Loess Plateau, where substantial erosion takes place. The large amount of mud and sand discharged into the river makes the Yellow River the most sediment-laden river in the world. The highest recorded annual level of silts discharged into the Yellow River is 3.91 billion tons in 1933. The highest silt concentration level was recorded in 1977 at 920 kg/m3 (57.4 lb/ft3). These sediments later deposit in the slower lower reaches of the river, elevating the river bed and creating the famous \\"river above ground\\". From Hekou to Yumenkou, the river passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, collectively called the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section make it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous Hukou Waterfall is in the lower part of this valley on the border of Shanxi and Shaanxi. =Lower reaches= In the lower reaches, from Zhengzhou, Henan to its mouth, a distance of , the river is confined to a levee-lined course as it flows to the northeast across the North China Plain before emptying into the Bohai Sea. The basin area in this stage is only , a mere 3% of the total, because few tributaries add to the flow in this stage; nearly all rivers to the south drain into the Huai River, whereas those to the north drain into the Hai River. The Huai River Basin, for example, is separated from the Yellow River Basin by the south dike of the Yellow River. The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is , with an average grade of 0.012%. The silts received from the middle reaches form sediments here, elevating the river bed. Excessive sediment deposits have raised the riverbed several meters above the surrounding ground. At Kaifeng, Henan, the Yellow River is above the ground level. =Tributaries= The mouth of the Daxia River (coming from bottom right), flowing into the Yellow River's Liujiaxia Reservoir in Linxia Prefecture, Gansu Tributaries of the Yellow River listed from its source to its mouth include: *White River *Black River *Huang Shui Datong River *Daxia River *Tao River *Zuli River *Qingshui River *Dahei River *Kuye River *Wuding River *Fen River *Wei River (the Wei River is the largest of these tributaries) *Luo River *Qin River *Dawen River *Kuo River Characteristics Expansion of the Yellow River Delta from 1989 to 2009 in five year intervals. The Yellow River is notable for the large amount of silt it carries‚Äî1.6 billion tons annually at the point where it descends from the Loess Plateau. If it is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea per year. One estimate gives 34 kilograms of silt per cubic meter as opposed to 10 for the Colorado and 1 for the Nile. Its average discharge is said to be 2,110 cubic meters per second (32,000 for the Yangtze), with a maximum of 25,000 and minimum of 245. However, since 1972, it often runs dry before it reaches the sea. The low volume is due to increased agricultural irrigation, increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river as of 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74,000 km2 (48,572 mi2) of land.China's Yellow River, Part 1. The New York Times (2007-05-30) The Yellow River delta totals 8,000 square kilometers (3,090 mi2). However, with the decrease in silt reaching the sea, it has been reported to be shrinking slightly each year since 1996 through erosion.Yellow River Delta Shrinking 7.6 Square Kilometers Annually, China Daily 1 February 2005 The highest volume occurs during the rainy season from July to October, when 60% of the annual volume of the river flows. Maximum demand for irrigation is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation, several dams have been built, but their expected life is limited due to the high silt load. A proposed South‚ÄìNorth Water Transfer Project involves several schemes to divert water from the Yangtze River: one in the western headwaters of the rivers where they are closest to one another, another from the upper reaches of the Han River, and a third using the route of the old Grand Canal. Due to its heavy load of silt the Yellow River is a depositing streamthat is, it deposits part of its carried burden of soil in its bed in stretches where it is flowing slowly. These deposits elevate the riverbed which flows between natural levees in its lower reaches. Should a flood occur, the river may break out of the levees into the surrounding lower flood plain and take a new channel. Historically this has occurred about once every hundred years. In modern times, considerable effort has been made to strengthen levees and control floods. Hydroelectric power dams Liujiaxia Dam, Gansu Sanmenxia Dam, Henan Below is the list of hydroelectric power stations built on the Yellow River, arranged according to the first year of operation (in brackets): *Sanmenxia Dam (1960; Sanmenxia, Henan) *Sanshenggong Dam (1966) *Qingtong Gorge hydroelectric power station (1968; Qingtongxia, Ningxia) *Liujiaxia Dam (Liujia Gorge) (1974; Yongjing County, Gansu) *Lijiaxia Dam (1997) (Jainca County, Qinghai) *Yanguoxia Dam (Yanguo Gorge) hydroelectric power station (1975; Yongjing County, Gansu) *Tianqiao Dam (1977) *Bapanxia Dam (Bapan Gorge) (1980; Xigu District, Lanzhou, Gansu) *Longyangxia Dam (1992; Gonghe County, Qinghai) *Da Gorge hydroelectric power station (1998) *Li Gorge hydroelectric power station (1999) *Wanjiazhai Dam (1999; Pianguan County, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia) *Xiaolangdi Dam (2001) (Jiyuan, Henan) *Laxiwa Dam (2010) (Guide County, Qinghai) *Yangqu Dam (2016) (Xinghai County, Qinghai) *Maerdang Dam (2018) (Maq√™n County, Qinghai) As reported in 2000, the 7 largest hydro power plants (Longyangxia, Lijiaxia, Liujiaxia, Yanguoxia, Bapanxia, Daxia and Qinglongxia) had the total installed capacity of 5,618 MW.Yellow River Upstream Important to West-East Power Transmission People's Daily, 14 December 2000 Crossings Major cities along the Yellow River Pontoon bridge (Luokou Pontoon Bridge ) over the Yellow River in Jinan, Shandong The main bridges and ferries by the province names in the order of downstream to upstream are: Shandong * Dongying Yellow River Bridge * Shengli Yellow River Bridge (Dongying) * Lijin Yellow River Bridge (Dongying) * Binzhou Yellow River Road-Railway Bridge * Binzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge * Binzhou‚ÄìLaiwu Expressway Binzhou Yellow River Bridge (Binzhou‚ÄìZibo) * Huiqing Yellow River Bridge (Binzhou‚ÄìZibo) * Jiyang Yellow River Bridge (Jinan) * G20 Qingdao‚ÄìYinchuan Expressway Jinan Yellow River Bridge (Jinan) * Jinan Yellow River Bridge * Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge (Jinan) * Jinan Jianbang Yellow River Bridge * Beijing‚ÄìShanghai High-speed Railway Jinan Yellow River Bridge (Jinan‚ÄìDezhou) * Beijing‚ÄìTaipei Expressway Jinan Yellow River Bridge (Jinan‚ÄìDezhou) * Beijing‚ÄìShanghai Railway Jinan Yellow River New Bridge (Jinan‚ÄìDezhou) * Pingyin Yellow River Bridge (Jinan-Liaocheng) Shandong‚ÄìHenan * Beijing‚ÄìKowloon Railway Sunkou Yellow River Bridge (Jining‚ÄìPuyang) * Juancheng Yellow River Highway Bridge (Heze‚ÄìPuyang) * Dongming Yellow River Highway Bridge (Heze‚ÄìPuyang) Henan * Kaifeng Yellow River Bridge (Kaifeng) * Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge (Zhengzhou) Shanxi‚ÄìHenan * Sanmen Yellow River Bridge (Sanmenxia) Shaanxi‚ÄìHenan * Hancheng Yumenkou Yellow River Bridge Ningxia * Yinchuan Yellow River Bridge (Yinchuan) Inner Mongolia * Baotou Yellow River Bridge (Baotou) Gansu * Lanzhou Yellow River Bridge * Zhongshan Bridge (Lanzhou) Qinghai * Dari Yellow River Bridge Fauna =Fish= The paradise fish is well known in the aquarium hobby and it originates from East Asian river basins, including the Yellow River The Yellow River basin is rich in fish, being the home of more than 160 native species in 92 genera and 28 families, including 19 species found nowhere else in the world (endemic). However, due to habitat loss, pollution, introduced species and overfishing many of the natives have declined or disappeared entirely; several are recognized as threatened on China's Red List. Dams and their reservoirs have increased the habitat for species of slow-moving and static waters, while it excluded species of flowing waters and prevented the up- and down-stream breeding migration of others. In the 2000s, only 80 native fish in 63 genera and 18 families were recorded in the Yellow River basin. In contrast, introduced fish have risen in both abundance and number of species; only one introduced fish species was recorded in the 1960s when ichthyologist Li Sizhong published his original survey of fish fauna of the region, but by the 2000s there were 26. As typical of Asian rivers, Cyprinidae is by far the most diverse family in the Yellow River basin. More than 85 cyprinids have been recorded in this basin, including species that still are present and species that no longer are present. Other highly diverse families are the stone loaches (more than 20 species), gobies ( 15 species), true loaches ( 10 species) and bagrid catfish ( 10 species). Although there are species found throughout much of the river, several have a more restricted range. For example, the uppermost, highest parts on the Qinghai‚ÄìTibet Plateau has relatively few native species, notably snowtrout and allies (Gymnocypris, Gymnodiptychus, Platypharodon and Schizopygopsis), and Triplophysa loaches. Of the 18 endemics in the Yellow River basin, 12 are (or were) found in the upper part. These in particular have become threatened and the fish fauna in many headwaters are now dominated by introduced salmonids. In contrast, the lowermost part of the river and its delta are home to many brackish water or euryhaline species, like gobies (although there are also true freshwater gobies in the Yellow River), Asian seabasses, flatfish and Takifugu pufferfish. Fishing remains an important activity, but catches have declined. In 2007, it was noted that 40% fewer fish were caught in the Yellow River compared to earlier catches. Large cyprinids (Asian carp, predatory carp, Wuchang bream and Mongolian redfin) and large catfish (Amur and Lanzhou catfish) are still present, but the largest species, the Chinese paddlefish, kaluga sturgeon and Yangtze sturgeon, have not been reported from the Yellow River basin in about 50 years. Other species that support important fisheries include white Amur bream, ayu, mandarin fish, Protosalanx icefish, northern snakehead, Asian swamp eel and others. =Aquaculture= The Chinese pond turtle (shown) and Chinese softshell turtle are both native to the Yellow River, but also farmed in large numbers The Yellow River is generally less suitable for aquaculture than the rivers of central and southern China, such as the Yangtze or the Pearl River, but aquaculture is also practiced in some areas along the Yellow River. An important aquaculture area is the riverside plain in Xingyang City, upstream from Zhengzhou. Since the development of fish ponds started in Xingyang's riverside Wangcun Town in 1986, the pond systems in Wangcun have grown to the total size of 15,000 mu (10 km2), making the town the largest aquaculture center in North China. Two turtle species are native to the Yellow River basin: the Chinese pond turtle and Chinese softshell turtle. Both species‚Äîbut especially the softshell‚Äîare widely farmed for food. A variety of the Chinese softshell turtle popular in Chinese gourmets is called the Yellow River turtle (). Nowadays most of the Yellow River turtles eaten in China's restaurants comes from turtle farms, which may or may not be near the Yellow River. In 2007, construction started in Wangcun, Henan on a large farm for raising this turtle variety. With the capacity for raising 5 million turtles a year, the facility was expected to become Henan's largest farm of this kind. The huge, entirely aquatic Chinese giant salamander, a species that has declined drastically due primarily to persecution for food and traditional medicine, is native to the Yellow River and other Chinese rivers. It is farmed in large numbers in several parts of China and genetic studies have revealed that the captive stock mostly is of Yellow River origin. As these often are released back into the wild, the Yellow River type of the Chinese giant salamander has spread to other parts of China, which represents a problem to the other types. Pollution On 25 November 2008, Tania Branigan of The Guardian filed a report \\"China's Mother River: the Yellow River\\", claiming that severe pollution has made one-third of China's Yellow River unusable even for agricultural or industrial use, due to factory discharges and sewage from fast-expanding cities. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission had surveyed more than of the river in 2007 and said 33.8% of the river system registered worse than \\"level five\\" according to the criteria used by the UN Environment Program. Level five is unfit for drinking, aquaculture, industrial use, or even agriculture. The report said waste and sewage discharged into the system last year totaled 4.29b tons. Industry and manufacturing made up 70% of the discharge into the river with households accounting for 23% and just over 6% coming from other sources. In culture Qikou town along Yellow River in Shanxi Province In ancient times, it was believed that the Yellow River flowed from Heaven as a continuation of the Milky Way. In a Chinese legend, Zhang Qian is said to have been commissioned to find the source of the Yellow River. After sailing up-river for many days, he saw a girl spinning and a cow herd. Upon asking the girl where he was, she presented him with her shuttle with instructions to show it to the astrologer Yen Ch√ºn-p'ing. When he returned, the astrologer recognized it as the shuttle of the Weaving Girl (Vega), and, moreover, said that at the time Zhang received the shuttle, he had seen a wandering star interpose itself between the Weaving Girl and the cow herd (Altair). The provinces of Hebei and Henan derive their names from the Yellow River. Their names mean, respectively, \\"North of the River\\" and \\"South of the River\\", although the border between them is never stable historically and currently the border between Hebei and Henan is not the Yellow River but the Zhang River instead. ;Mother river, China's Sorrow, and cradle of Chinese civilization. Traditionally, it is believed that the Chinese civilization originated in the Yellow River basin. The Chinese refer to the river as \\"the Mother River\\" and \\"the cradle of the Chinese civilization\\". During the long history of China, the Yellow River has been considered a blessing as well as a curse and has been nicknamed both \\"China's Pride\\" and \\"China's Sorrow\\".Cheng, Linsun and Brown, Kerry (2009) Berkshire encyclopedia of China, Berkshire Publishing Group, p. 1125 ;When the Yellow River flows clear. Sometimes the Yellow River is poetically called the \\"Muddy Flow\\" (). The Chinese idiom \\"when the Yellow River flows clear\\" is used to refer to an event that will never happen and is similar to the English expression \\"when pigs fly\\". \\"The Yellow River running clear\\" was reported as a good omen during the reign of the Yongle Emperor, along with the appearance of such auspicious legendary beasts as qilin (an African giraffe brought to China by a Bengal embassy aboard Zheng He's ships in 1414) and zouyu (not positively identified) and other strange natural phenomena.

It is one of four seas named after common colour terms (the others being the Black Sea, the Red Sea and the White Sea), and its name is descriptive of the phenomenon whereby fine sand grains from the Gobi Desert sand storms, that descend annually from the north, turn the surface of its waters a golden yellow. The innermost bay of northwestern Yellow Sea is called the Bohai Sea (previously Pechihli Bay or Chihli Bay), into which flow some of the most important rivers of northern China, such as the Yellow River (through Shandong province and its capital Jinan), the Hai River (through Beijing and Tianjin) and the Liao River (through Liaoning province). Sand and silt carried down by these rivers contribute further to the sea's colour. The northern extension of the Yellow Sea is called the Korea Bay, into which flow the Yalu River, the Chongchon River and the Taedong River.

The sea is a flooded section of continental shelf that formed after the last ice age (some 10,000 years ago) as sea levels rose to their current levels. The depth gradually increases from north to south. The sea bottom and shores are dominated by sand and silt brought by the rivers through the Bohai Sea (Liao River, Yellow River, Hai He) and the Korea Bay (Yalu River). These deposits, together with sand storms are responsible for the yellowish colour of the water referenced in the sea's name.Yellow Sea, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica on-line Major islands of the sea include Anmado, Baengnyeongdo, Daebudo, Deokjeokdo, Gageodo, Ganghwado, Hauido, Heuksando, Hongdo, Jejudo, Jindo, Muuido, Sido, Silmido, Sindo, Wando, Yeongjongdo and Yeonpyeongdo (all in South Korea).

Average January temperatures are in the north and in the south. Summers are wet and warm with frequent typhoons between June and October. Air temperatures range between . The average annual precipitation increases from about in the north to in the south. Fog is frequent along the coasts, especially in the upwelling cold- water areas. The sea has a warm cyclone current, forming part of the Kuroshio Current, which diverges near the western part of Japan and flows northward into the Yellow Sea at the speed of below . Southward currents prevail near the sea coast, especially in the winter monsoon period. Brown sediment spills out into the Yellow Sea from rivers in eastern China and Korea. The nutrients in the sediment may be responsible for the bloom of phytoplankton seen as blue-green swirls.Sediments and Phytoplankton bloom near the Mouth of the Yangtze, East China Sea , NASA, 2002 The water temperature is close to freezing in the northern part in winter, so drift ice patches and continuous ice fields form and hinder navigation between November and March. The water temperature and salinity are homogeneous across the depth. The southern waters are warmer at . In spring and summer, the upper layer is warmed up by the sun and diluted by the fresh water from rivers, while the deeper water remains cold and saline. This deep water stagnates and slowly moves south. Commercial bottom-dwelling fishes are found around this mass of water, especially at its southern part. Summer temperatures range between . The average salinity is relatively low, at 30‚Ä∞ in the north to 33‚Äì34‚Ä∞ in the south, dropping to 26‚Ä∞ or lower near the river deltas. In the southwest monsoon season (June to August) the increased rainfall and runoff further reduce the salinity of the upper sea layer. Water transparency increases from about in the north up to in the south. Tides are semidiurnal, i.e. rise twice a day. Their amplitude varies between about at the coast of China. Tides are higher at the Korean Peninsula, typically ranging between and reaching the maximum in spring. The tidal system rotates in a counterclockwise direction. The speed of the tidal current is generally less than in the middle of the sea, but may increase to more than near the coasts.

For example, the seaweed production in the area was as high as 1.5 million tonnes in 1979 for China alone. The abundance of all these plant and animal species increases toward the south and indicates a high sea productivity, accounting for the diversity of fish species and high fish yield from the sea.Chikuni, pp. 8, 16, 19 Several species of goby new to science have been discovered recently in the Yellow Sea. The southern part of the Yellow Sea, including the entire west coast of Korea, contains a belt of intertidal mudflats, which has the total area of and is maintained by .

Those include spotted seals, and cetaceans such as minke whales, killer whales, false killer whales, and finless porpoises, but nonetheless all the remnants of species listed could be in very small numbers.

Economy A map of population density (1994)Population Density , NASA, 1994 The coasts of the Yellow Sea are very densely populated, at approximately . The sea waters had been used for fishing by the Chinese, Korean and Japanese ships for centuries. Especially rich in fish are the bottom layers. About 200 fish species are exploited commercially, especially sea bream, croakers, lizard fishes, prawns, cutlassfish, horse mackerel, squid, eel, filefish, Pacific herring, chub mackerel, flounderChikuni, p. 25 and jellyfish. The intensity of fishing has been gradually increasing for China and Korea and decreasing for Japan. For example, the production volumes for China rose from 619,000 tonnes in 1985 to 1,984,400 tonnes in 1996.Fishing Industry , noaa.gov All species are overfished, however, and while the total catchments are rising, the fish population is continuously declining for most species.Chikuni, pp. 37, 47, 55 Navigation is another traditional activity in the Yellow Sea. The main Chinese ports are Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao and Qinhuangdao. The major South Korean ports on the Yellow Sea are Incheon, Gunsan and Mokpo, and that for North Korea is Nampho, the outport of Pyongyang. The Bohai Train Ferry provides a shortcut between the Liaodong Peninsula and Shandong. A major naval accident occurred on 24 November 1999 at Yantai, Shandong, China when the 9,000-ton Chinese ferry Dashun caught fire and capsized in rough seas. About 300 people were killed making it the worst maritime incident in China.Ferry sinks in Yellow Sea, killing hundreds, 24 November 1999 Oil exploration has been successful in the Chinese and North Korean portions of the sea, with the proven and estimated reserves of about 9 and 20 billion tonnes, respectively.China found new large oil field in the Yellow Sea, News.ru, 3 May 2007 (in Russian) However, the study and exploration of the sea is somewhat hindered by insufficient sharing of information between the involved countries. China initiated collaborations with foreign oil companies in 1979, but this initiative declined later. A major oil spill occurred on 16 July 2010 when a pipeline exploded at the north-east port of Dalian, causing a wide-scale fire and spreading about 1,500 tonnes of oil over the sea area of . The port had been closed and fishing suspended until the end of August.

(2007) The Yellow Sea: Analysis of Environmental Status and Trends. p. 408, Ansan, Republic of Korea. Loss of natural coastal habitats due to land reclamation has resulted in the destruction of more than 60% of tidal wetlands around the Yellow Sea coastline in approximately 50 years. Rapid coastal development for agriculture, aquaculture and industrial development are considered the primary drivers of coastal destruction in the region. This degree of loss of area, widespread pollution, algal blooms and declines of invertebrate and vertebrate fauna have resulted in the classification of this ecosystem as endangered. In addition to land reclamation, the Yellow Sea ecosystem is facing several other serious environmental problems. Pollution is widespread and deterioration of pelagic and benthic habitat quality has occurred, and harmful algal blooms frequently occur. Invasion of introduced species are having a detrimental effect on the Yellow Sea environment. There are 25 intentionally introduced species and 9 unintentionally introduced species in the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem. Declines of biodiversity, fisheries and ecosystem services in the Yellow Sea are widespread. The tidal flats of the Yellow Sea are considered endangered. Location of Korean Peace Zones On 1 November 2018, officials from South Korea's Ministry of National Defense confirmed that \\"peace zones\\" had been established by the North and South Korean militaries in the Yellow Sea area that touches the North and South Korean demarcation line. A buffer zone was also created in the Yellow Sea's Northern Limit Line (NLL).

The Hai River at Tianjin is formed by the confluence of five rivers, the Southern Canal, Ziya River, Daqing River, Yongding River, and the Northern Canal. The southern and northern canals are parts of the Grand Canal. The Southern Canal is joined by the Wei River at Linqing. The Northern Canal joins with the Bai He (or Chaobai River) at Tongzhou. The Northern Canal (sharing a channel with Bai He) is also the only waterway from the sea to Beijing. Therefore, early Westerners also called the Hai He the Bai He. At Tianjin, through the Grand Canal, the Hai connects with the Yellow and Yangtze rivers. The construction of the Grand Canal greatly altered the rivers of the Hai He basin. Previously, the Wei, Ziya Yongding and Bai Rivers flowed separately to the sea. The Grand Canal cut through the lower reaches of these rivers and fused them into one outlet to the sea, in the form of the current Hai He. The Hai River is long measured from the longest tributary. However, the Hai River is only around from Tianjin to its estuary. Its basin has an area of approximately . History The Bund of the Hai River. On 20 May 1858, the Pei-ho, as it was then known, was the scene of an invasion by Anglo-French forces during the Second Opium War whereby the Taku Forts were captured. In 1863 seagoing ships could reach the head of navigation at Tongzhou, but the crooked river was difficult for large vessels.Alexander Michie,The Siberian Overland Route from Peking to Petersburg, 1864 During the Boxer Rebellion, Imperial Chinese forces deployed a weapon called \\"electric mines\\" on June 15, at the Baihe river before the Battle of Taku Forts (1900), to prevent the western Eight-Nation Alliance from sending ships to attack.

War Dept.))(Original from the New York Public Library) Like the Yellow River, the Hai is exceedingly muddy because of the powdery soil through which it flows. The silt carried by the water deposits in the lower reaches, sometimes causing flooding. The waters from the five major tributaries only have one shallow outlet to the sea, which makes such floods stronger. Because China's capital (and second largest city), Beijing, and the third largest city, Tianjin, both lie in the Hai He Basin, Hai He floods cause a significant loss. To alleviate flooding, reservoirs have been built and artificial channels dug to divert excess water directly into the sea. For example, the Chaobai River is diverted to the Chaobai Xin River and no longer joins with the Northern Canal. Due to industrial and urban development in the Hai He Basin, the volume of water flow has greatly decreased. Many smaller tributaries and some of the major tributaries are dry for most of the year. With reduced water flow, water pollution worsens. The water shortage in the Hai He basin is expected to be alleviated by the South-North Water Transfer Project.

Strauss notes that \\"Our sole source of information as to the time of his birth is the entry of his matriculation in the register of Trinity College\\" on 17 July 1694, where \\"His age is given as 17.\\" Earlier biographers took this to mean Farquhar was in his 17th year‚Äîhence born in 1678‚Äîand Strauss favors this date. But later writers, such as William Myers, ed., George Farquhar: The Recruiting Officer and Other Plays, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. vii, give the dual year, and John Ross, ed., George Farquhar: The Recruiting Officer (New Mermaids), 2nd ed., (London: A&C; Black, 1991), p. xiii, gives a birthdate of \\"ca. 1677\\" for the playwright. ‚Äì 29 April 1707) was an Irish dramatist. He is noted for his contributions to late Restoration comedy, particularly for his plays The Constant Couple (1699), The Recruiting Officer (1706) and The Beaux' Stratagem (1707). Early life Born in Derry, Farquhar was one of seven children born to William Farquhar, a clergyman of modest means. The author of \\"Memoirs of Mr. George Farquhar,\\" a biographical sketch prefixed to certain 18th century editionsAlex. Charles Ewald quotes from a slightly different version of these \\"Memoirs\\" in the introduction to his edition of The Dramatic Works of George Farquhar (London: John C. Nimmo, 1892), Vol. 1, p. vi‚Äìvii, and Strauss, op. cit, p. vi et seq., cites from but does not quote a biographical writing by \\"T. Wilkes\\" given in the 1775 Dublin edition of Farquhar which agrees in some but not all details with the version quoted in this article (referenced in the next note). of his works, claims that Farquhar He was educated at Foyle College and later entered Trinity College, Dublin at age 17 as a sizar under the patronage of the Bishop of Dromore, who may have been related to Farquhar's mother. Farquhar may have initially intended to follow his father's profession and become a clergyman, but was \\"unhappy and rebellious as a student\\" and left college after two years to become an actor. His 18th century biographer claims that the departure was because \\"his gay and volatile Disposition could not long relish the Gravity and Retirement of a College-life,\\" but another story of uncertain veracity has him being expelled from Trinity College due to a \\"profane jest.\\" Engraving of a performance of George Farquhar by Michiel van der Gucht after unknown artist, published 1711 Acting career Farquhar joined a company performing on the Dublin stage, probably through his acquaintance with the well-known actor Robert Wilks. However, Farquhar was reportedly not that impressive as an actor. We are told that \\"his Voice was somewhat weak\\" and that \\"his movements [were] stiff and ungraceful.\\" But he was well received by audiences and thought to continue in this career \\"till something better should offer.\\" Some of the roles reportedly played by Farquhar were Lennox in Shakespeare's Macbeth, Young Bellair in The Man of Mode by George Etherege, Lord Dion in Philaster by Beaumont and Fletcher, and Guyomar in The Indian Emperor by John Dryden. But while he was performing in the Dryden play, an accident on stage put an end to Farquhar's acting career. As Guyomar, Farquhar was supposed to \\"kill\\" Vasquez, one of the Spanish generals in the drama. Forgetting to exchange his sword for a foil before enacting this scene, Farquhar severely wounded Price, the actor playing Vasquez. Although Price recovered, Farquhar resolved after this mishap to give up acting for good. Writing career Farquhar then left for London, \\"possibly with a draft of his first play in his portmanteau.\\" Some writers tie his move to that of his friend Wilks, who had received an offer from the manager of Drury Lane to come to London and join that theatre, and Wilks is also credited with encouraging Farquhar's efforts at writing plays. Farquhar's first comedy, Love and a Bottle, was premiered in 1698; \\"for its sprightly Dialogue and busy Scenes,\\" it is said to have been \\"well received by the Audience.\\" Called a \\"licentious piece\\" by one scholar, and cited as proof that Farquhar had \\"absorbed the stock topics, character- types, and situations of Restoration comedy\\" by another, the play deals with Roebuck, \\"An Irish Gentleman of a wild roving Temper\\" who is \\"newly come to London.\\" The general character of the play can be evaluated by considering that in the opening scene, Roebuck tells his friend Lovewell that he has left Ireland due to getting a woman pregnant with twins (a boy and a girl) and to Roebuck's father trying to force Roebuck to marry the woman; however, Roebuck remarks, \\"Heav'n was pleas'd to lessen my Affliction, by taking away the She- brat.\\" Most of these plot details are pointed out by William Myers, op. cit., p. vii. After the favourable reception of Love and a Bottle, Farquhar decided to devote himself to playwriting. He also at this point received a commission in the regiment of the Earl of Orrery, so his time for the next few years was divided between the vocations of soldier and dramatist. It was also at about this time that Farquhar discovered Anne Oldfield, who was reading aloud a scene from The Scornful Lady at her aunt's tavern. Impressed, he brought her to the notice of Sir John Vanbrugh, and this led to her theatrical career, during which she was the first performer of major female roles in Farquhar's last comedies. In 1700, Farquhar's The Constant Couple was acted at Drury Lane and proved a great success, helped considerably by his friend Wilks' portrayal of the character of Sir Henry Wildair (a performance that Farquhar himself praised generously in his \\"Preface to the Reader\\" when the play was published). The playwright followed up with a sequel, Sir Harry Wildair, the following year, and in 1702 wrote the comedies The Inconstant and The Twin Rivals. Also in 1702, Farquhar published Love and Business, a collection that included letters, verse, and A Discourse Upon Comedy. The next year, he married Margaret Pemell, \\"a widow with three children, ten years his senior,\\" who reportedly tricked him into the marriage by pretending to have a great fortune. His 18th century biographer records that \\"though he found himself deceived, his Circumstances embarrassed, and his Family increasing, he never upbraided her for the Cheat, but behaved to her with all the Delicacy and Tenderness of an indulgent Husband.\\" He was engaged in recruiting for the army, due to the War of the Spanish Succession, for the next three years, writing little except The Stage Coach in collaboration with Peter Motteux; this was an adaptation of a French play. He drew on his recruiting experience for his next comedy, The Recruiting Officer (1706). However, Farquhar had to sell his army commission to pay debts, reportedly after the Duke of Ormonde advised him to do so, promising him another but failing to keep his promise. Early in 1707, Farquhar's friend Wilks visited him; Farquhar was ill and in distress, and Wilks is said to have \\"cheered him with a substantial present, and urged him to write another comedy.\\" This comedy, The Beaux' Stratagem, was given its premi√®re on 8 March 1707; we know from Farquhar's own statement prefacing the published version of the play that he wrote it during his sickness: Farquhar died on 29 April 1707, not quite two months after the opening of this last play. He was buried in the Church of St. Martin in the Fields, London, on 3 May.

A prot√©g√© of Gustav Klimt, Schiele was a major figurative painter of the early 20th century. His work is noted for its intensity and its raw sexuality, and the many self-portraits the artist produced, including nude self-portraits. The twisted body shapes and the expressive line that characterize Schiele's paintings and drawings mark the artist as an early exponent of Expressionism. Biography =Early life= Schiele aged 16, self-portrait from 1906 Schiele was born in 1890 in Tulln, Lower Austria. His father, Adolf Schiele, the station master of the Tulln station in the Austrian State Railways, was born in 1851 in Vienna to Karl Ludwig Schiele, a German from Ballenstedt and Aloisia Schimak; Egon Schiele's mother Marie, n√©e Soukup, was born in 1861 in ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov (Krumau) to Johann Franz Soukup, a Czech father from Mirkovice, and Aloisia Poferl, a German Bohemian mother from ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov. As a child, Schiele was fascinated by trains, and would spend many hours drawing them, to the point where his father felt obliged to destroy his sketchbooks. When he was 11 years old, Schiele moved to the nearby city of Krems (and later to Klosterneuburg) to attend secondary school. To those around him, Schiele was regarded as a strange child. Shy and reserved, he did poorly at school except in athletics and drawing,F. Whitford, 1981, p30 and was usually in classes made up of younger pupils. He also displayed incestuous tendencies towards his younger sister Gertrude (who was known as Gerti), and his father, well aware of Egon's behaviour, was once forced to break down the door of a locked room that Egon and Gerti were in to see what they were doing (only to discover that they were developing a film). When he was sixteen he took the twelve-year-old Gerti by train to Trieste without permission and spent a night in a hotel room with her.F. Whitford, 1989, p29 = Academy of Fine Arts = When Schiele was 14 years old, his father died from syphilis, and he became a ward of his maternal uncle, Leopold Czihaczek, also a railway official. Although he wanted Schiele to follow in his footsteps, and was distressed at his lack of interest in academia, he recognised Schiele's talent for drawing and unenthusiastically allowed him a tutor, the artist Ludwig Karl Strauch. In 1906 Schiele applied at the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Arts and Crafts) in Vienna, where Gustav Klimt had once studied. Within his first year there, Schiele was sent, at the insistence of several faculty members, to the more traditional Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste in Vienna in 1906. His main teacher at the academy was Christian Griepenkerl, a painter whose strict doctrine and ultra-conservative style frustrated and dissatisfied Schiele and his fellow students so much that he left three years later. =Klimt and first exhibitions= 217x217px In 1907, Schiele sought out Gustav Klimt, who generously mentored younger artists. Klimt took a particular interest in the young Schiele, buying his drawings, offering to exchange them for some of his own, arranging models for him and introducing him to potential patrons. He also introduced Schiele to the Wiener Werkst√§tte, the arts and crafts workshop connected with the Secession. Schiele's earliest works between 1907 and 1909 contain strong similarities with those of Klimt,Kallir, 2003, pages 46, 52, 60 as well as influences from Art Nouveau.Kallir, 2003, page 41 In 1908 Schiele had his first exhibition, in Klosterneuburg. Schiele left the Academy in 1909, after completing his third year, and founded the Neukunstgruppe (\\"New Art Group\\") with other dissatisfied students. In his early years, Schiele was strongly influenced by Klimt and Kokoschka. Although imitations of their styles, particularly with the former, are noticeably visible in Schiele's first works, he soon evolved his own distinctive style. Portrait of Anton Peschka 1909 Living room in Neulengbach, 1911 Klimt invited Schiele to exhibit some of his work at the 1909 Vienna Kunstschau, where he encountered the work of Edvard Munch, Jan Toorop, and Vincent van Gogh among others. Once free of the constraints of the Academy's conventions, Schiele began to explore not only the human form, but also human sexuality. Schiele's work was already daring, but it went a bold step further with the inclusion of Klimt's decorative eroticism and with what some may like to call figurative distortions, that included elongations, deformities, and sexual openness. Schiele's self- portraits helped re-establish the energy of with their unique level of emotional and sexual honesty and use of figural distortion in place of conventional ideals of beauty. He also painted tributes to Van Gogh's Sunflowers as well as landscapes and still lifes. In 1910, Schiele began experimenting with nudes and within a year a definitive style featuring emaciated, sickly-coloured figures, often with strong sexual overtones. Schiele also began painting and drawing children.Kallir, 2003, pages 86, 88, 123 Schiele's self portrait, Kneeling Nude with Raised Hands (1910), is considered among the most significant nude art pieces made during the 20th century. Schiele's radical and developed approach towards the naked human form challenged both scholars and progressives alike. This unconventional piece and style went against strict academia and created a sexual uproar with its contorted lines and heavy display of figurative expression. At the time, many found the explicitness of his works disturbing. Egon Schiele photographed by Anton Josef Trƒçka, 1914 From then on, Schiele participated in numerous group exhibitions, including those of the Neukunstgruppe in Prague in 1910 and Budapest in 1912; the Sonderbund, Cologne, in 1912; and several Secessionist shows in Munich, beginning in 1911. In 1911, Schiele met the seventeen-year- old Walburga (Wally) Neuzil, who lived with him in Vienna and served as a model for some of his most striking paintings. Very little is known of her, except that she had previously modelled for Gustav Klimt and might have been one of his mistresses. Schiele and Wally wanted to escape what they perceived as the claustrophobic Viennese milieu, and went to the small town of ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov (Krumau) in southern Bohemia. Krumau was the birthplace of Schiele's mother; today it is the site of a museum dedicated to Schiele. Despite Schiele's family connections in Krumau, he and his lover were driven out of the town by the residents, who strongly disapproved of their lifestyle, including his alleged employment of the town's teenage girls as models. Progressively, Schiele's work grew more complex and thematic, and he eventually would begin dealing with themes such as death and rebirth.Kallir, 2003, pages 224, 230, 231 =Neulengbach and imprisonment= 188x188px Together the couple moved to Neulengbach, west of Vienna, seeking inspirational surroundings and an inexpensive studio in which to work. As it was in the capital, Schiele's studio became a gathering place for Neulengbach's delinquent children. Schiele's way of life aroused much animosity among the town's inhabitants, and in April 1912 he was arrested for seducing a young girl of 13, below the 14-year-old age of consent. When the police came to his studio to place Schiele under arrest, they seized more than a hundred drawings which they considered pornographic. Schiele was imprisoned while awaiting his trial. When his case was brought before a judge, the charges of seduction and abduction were dropped, but the artist was found guilty of exhibiting erotic drawings in a place accessible to children. In court, the judge burned one of the offending drawings over a candle flame. The twenty-one days he had already spent in custody were taken into account, and he was sentenced to a further three days' imprisonment. While in prison, Schiele created a series of 12 paintings depicting the difficulties and discomfort of being locked in a jail cell. Self portrait In 1913, the Galerie Hans Goltz, Munich, mounted Schiele's first solo show. A solo exhibition of his work took place in Paris in 1914.Kallir, 2003, pages 277, 362, 444 Edith Schiele 1915 In 1914, Schiele glimpsed the sisters Edith and Ad√©le Harms, who lived with their parents across the street from his studio in the Viennese district of Hietzing, 101 Hietzinger Hauptstra√üe. They were a middle-class family and Protestant by faith; their father was a master locksmith. In 1915, Schiele chose to marry the more socially acceptable Edith, but had apparently expected to maintain a relationship with Wally. However, when he explained the situation to Wally, she left him immediately and never saw him again. This abandonment led him to paint Death and the Maiden, where Wally's portrait is based on a previous pairing, but Schiele's is newly struck. (In February 1915, Schiele wrote a note to his friend Arthur Roessler stating: \\"I intend to get married, advantageously. Not to Wally.\\") Despite some opposition from the Harms family, Schiele and Edith were married on 17 June 1915, the anniversary of the wedding of Schiele's parents. =WWI to death= Photograph of Egon Schiele, 1910s Although Schiele avoided conscription for almost a year, World War I now began to shape his life and work. Three days after his wedding, Schiele was ordered to report for active service in the army where he was initially stationed in Prague. Edith came with him and stayed in a hotel in the city, while Egon lived in an exhibition hall with his fellow conscripts. They were allowed by Schiele's commanding officer to see each other occasionally. During the war, Schiele's paintings became larger and more detailed. His military service, however, gave him limited time, and much of his output consisted of linear drawings of scenery and military officers. Around this time, Schiele also began experimenting with the themes of motherhood and family. His wife Edith was the model for most of his female figures, but during the war (due to circumstance) many of his sitters were male. Since 1915, Schiele's female nudes became fuller in figure, but many were deliberately illustrated with a lifeless doll-like appearance. Despite his military service, Schiele was still exhibiting in Berlin. He also had successful shows in Z√ºrich, Prague, and Dresden. His first duties consisted of guarding and escorting Russian prisoners. Because of his weak heart and his excellent handwriting, Schiele was eventually given a job as a clerk in a POW camp near the town of M√ºhling. There, he was allowed to draw and paint imprisoned Russian officers; his commander, Karl Moser (who assumed that Schiele was a painter and decorator when he first met him), even gave him a disused store room to use as a studio. Since Schiele was in charge of the food stores in the camp, he and Edith could enjoy food beyond rations.F. Whitford, 1981, p164-168 By 1917, he was back in Vienna and able to focus on his artistic career. His output was prolific, and his work reflected the maturity of an artist in full command of his talents. He was invited to participate in the Secession's 49th exhibition, held in Vienna in 1918. Schiele had fifty works accepted for this exhibition, and they were displayed in the main hall. He also designed a poster for the exhibition; it was reminiscent of the Last Supper, with a portrait of himself in the place of Christ. The show was a triumphant success. As a result, prices for Schiele's drawings increased and he received many portrait commissions. In the autumn of 1918, the Spanish flu pandemic that claimed more than 20,000,000 lives in Europe reached Vienna. Edith, who was six months pregnant, succumbed to the disease on 28 October. Schiele died only three days after his wife. He was 28 years old. During the three days between their deaths, Schiele drew a few sketches of Edith.Frank Whitford, Expressionist Portraits, Abbeville Press, 1987, p. 46. . Style Some critics such as Jane Kallir have commented upon Schiele's work as being grotesque, erotic, pornographic, or disturbing, focusing on sex, death, and discovery. He focused on portraits of others as well as himself. In his later years, while he still worked often with nudes, they were done in a more realist fashion. Legacy Max Oppenheimer 1910 Schiele was the subject of the biographical film, Excess and Punishment (aka Egon Schiele ‚Äì Exzess und Bestrafung), a 1980 film originating in Germany with a European cast that explores Schiele's artistic demons leading up to his early death. The film was directed by Herbert Vesely and stars Mathieu Carri√®re as Schiele, Jane Birkin as his early artistic muse Wally Neuzil, Christine Kaufman as his wife, Edith Harms, and Kristina Van Eyck as her sister, Adele Harms. Also in 1980, the Arts Council of Great Britain produced a documentary film, Schiele in Prison, which looked at the circumstances of Schiele's imprisonment and the veracity of his diary. In 2016 another biographical film was released, Egon Schiele: Death and the Maiden (German: Egon Schiele: Tod und M√§dchen). Joanna Scott's 1990 novel Arrogance was based on Schiele's life and makes him the main figure. His life was also depicted in a theatrical dance production by Stephan Mazurek called Egon Schiele, presented in May 1995, for which Rachel's, an American post-rock group, composed a score titled Music for Egon Schiele. For The Featherstonehaughs contemporary dance company, Lea Anderson choreographed The Featherstonehaughs Draw On The Sketchbooks Of Egon Schiele in 1997. Schiele's life and work have also been the subject of essays, including a discussion of his works by fashion photographer Richard Avedon in an essay on portraiture entitled \\"Borrowed Dogs.\\"\\"Performance & Reality: Essays from Grand Street (magazine),\\" edited by Ben Sonnenberg Mario Vargas Llosa uses the work of Schiele as a conduit to seduce and morally exploit a main character in his 1997 novel The Notebooks of Don Rigoberto. Wes Anderson's film The Grand Budapest Hotel features a painting by Rich Pellegrino that is modeled after Schiele's style which, as part of a theft, replaces a so-called Flemish/Renaissance masterpiece, but is then destroyed by the angry owner when he discovers the deception. Julia Jordan based her 1999 play Tatjana in Color, which was produced off-Broadway at The Culture Project during the fall of 2003, on a fictionalization of the relationship between Shiele and the 12-year-old Tatjana von Mossig, the Neulengbach girl whose morals he was ultimately convicted of corrupting for allowing her to see his paintings. The opening chapters of Guy Mankowski's 2017 novel An Honest Deceit were cited to be heavily influenced by Schiele's paintings; in particular his portrayals of his sister, Gertrude. Leopold Museum in 2008 =Art collections= The Leopold Museum, Vienna houses perhaps Schiele's most important and complete collection of work, featuring over 200 exhibits. The museum sold one of these, Houses With Colorful Laundry (Suburb II), for $40.1 million at Sotheby's in 2011. Other notable collections of Schiele's art include the Egon Schiele-Museum, Tulln, the √ñsterreichische Galerie Belvedere, and the Albertina Graphic Collection, both in Vienna. Viktor Fogarassy collected works by Schiele, including D√§mmernde Stadt. =Auction history= Portrait of Wally, 1912 Portrait of Wally, a 1912 portrait, was purchased by Rudolf Leopold in 1954 and became part of the collection of the Leopold Museum when it was established by the Austrian government, purchasing more than 5,000 pieces that Leopold had owned. After a 1997‚Äì1998 exhibit of Schiele's work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the painting was seized by order of the New York County District Attorney and had been tied up in litigation by heirs of its former owner who claim that the painting was Nazi plunder and should be returned to them.Bayzler, Michael J.; and Alford, Roger P. Holocaust restitution: perspectives on the litigation and its legacy, p. 281. NYU Press, 2006. . Accessed 5 July 2010. The dispute was settled on 20 July 2010 and the picture subsequently purchased by the Leopold Museum for US$19 million.

The larger species, M. birostris, reaches in width, while the smaller, M. alfredi, reaches . Both have triangular pectoral fins, horn-shaped cephalic fins and large, forward-facing mouths. They are classified among the Myliobatiformes (stingrays and relatives) and are placed in the family Myliobatidae (eagle rays). Mantas are found in warm temperate, subtropical and tropical waters. Both species are pelagic; M. birostris migrates across open oceans, singly or in groups, while M. alfredi tends to be resident and coastal. They are filter feeders and eat large quantities of zooplankton, which they gather with their open mouths as they swim. However, research suggests that the majority of their diet (73%) actually comes from mesopelagic sources. Gestation lasts over a year and mantas give birth to live pups. Mantas may visit cleaning stations for the removal of parasites. Like whales, they breach for unknown reasons. Both species are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them. Taxonomy and etymology The name \\"manta\\" is Portuguese and Spanish for mantle (cloak or blanket), a type of blanket-shaped trap traditionally used to catch rays. Mantas are known as \\"devilfish\\" because of their horn-shaped cephalic fins, which are imagined to give them an \\"evil\\" appearance. Manta rays are members of the order Myliobatiformes which consists of stingrays and their relatives. The genus Manta is part of the eagle ray family Myliobatidae, where it is grouped in the subfamily Mobulinae along with the Mobula devil rays. In 2017, an analysis of DNA, and to a lesser degree, morphology, found that Mobula was paraphyletic with respect to the manta rays, and they recommended treating Manta as a junior synonym of Mobula. Mantas evolved from bottom-dwelling stingrays, eventually developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris still has a vestigial remnant of a sting barb in the form of a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on the underside of the head, while in mantas, they are right at the front. Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders. =Species= The scientific naming of mantas has had a convoluted history, during which several names were used for both the genus (Ceratoptera, Brachioptilon Daemomanta, and Diabolicthys) and species (such as vampyrus, americana, johnii, and hamiltoni). All were eventually treated as synonyms of the single species Manta birostris. Check genus and type \\"Manta\\" in search box. The genus name Manta was first published in 1829 by Dr Edward Nathaniel Bancroft of Jamaica.; see E.N. Bancroft On the fish known in Jamaica as the sea-devil, 1829 The specific name birostris is ascribed to Johann Julius Walbaum (1792) by some authorities and to Johann August Donndorff (1798) by others. The specific name alfredi was first used by Australian zoologist Gerard Krefft, who named the manta after Prince Alfred. Manta alfredi with mouth closed, cephalic fins rolled and ventral surface showing distinctive markings Authorities were still not in agreement and some argued that the black color morph was a different species from the mostly white morph. This proposal was discounted by a 2001 study of the mitochondrial DNA of both. A 2009 study analyzed the differences in morphology, including color, meristic variation, spine, dermal denticles (tooth-like scales), and teeth of different populations. Two distinct species emerged: the smaller M. alfredi found in the Indo-Pacific and tropical east Atlantic, and the larger M. birostris found throughout tropical, subtropical and warm temperate oceans. The former is more coastal, while the latter is more ocean-going and migratory. A 2010 study on mantas around Japan confirmed the morphological and genetic differences between M. birostris and M. alfredi. A third possible species, preliminarily called Manta sp. cf. birostris, reaches at least in width, and inhabits the tropical west Atlantic, including the Caribbean. M. birostris and it occurs in sympatry. More recently, DNA studies published in 2017 suggest that the genus Manta should be nested within Mobula, and that six existing species of Mobula should be consolidated into three. =Fossil record= While some small teeth have been found, few fossilized skeletons of manta rays have been discovered. Their cartilaginous skeletons do not preserve well, as they lack the calcification of the bony fish. Only three sedimentary beds bearing manta ray fossils are known, one from the Oligocene in South Carolina and two from the Miocene and Pliocene in North Carolina. Click on \\"Age range and collections\\". Remains of an extinct species have been found in the Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina. These were originally described as Manta fragilis, but were later reclassified as Paramobula fragilis. Biology =Appearance and anatomy= Side view of M. birostris Manta rays have broad heads, triangular pectoral fins, and horn-shaped cephalic fins located on either side of their mouths. They have horizontally flattened bodies with eyes on the sides of their heads behind the cephalic fins, and gill slits on their ventral surfaces. Their tails lack skeletal support and are shorter than their disc-like bodies. The dorsal fins are small and at the base of the tail. The largest mantas can reach . In both species, the width is about 2.2 times the length of the body; M. birostris reaches at least in width, while M. alfredi reaches about . Dorsally, mantas are typically black or dark in color with pale markings on their \\"shoulders\\". Ventrally, they are usually white or pale with distinctive dark markings by which individual mantas can be recognized. Their skin is covered in mucus which protects it from infection. All-black color morphs are known to exist. A pink manta ray has been observed in Australia's Great Barrier Reef and scientists believe this could be due to a genetic mutation. The fish, spotted near Lady Elliot Island, is the world's only known pink manta ray. M.alfredi with cephalic fins rolled up (Yap, Micronesia) The two species of manta differ in color patterns, dermal denticles, and dentition. M. birostris has more angular shoulder markings, larger ventral dark spots on the abdominal region, charcoal-colored ventral outlines on the pectoral fins, and a dark colored mouth. The shoulder markings of M. alfredi are more rounded, while its ventral spots are located near the posterior end and between the gill slits, and the mouth is white or pale colored. The denticles have multiple cusps and overlap in M. birostris, while those of M. alfredi are evenly spaced and lack cusps. Both species have small, square-shaped teeth on the lower jaw, but M. birostris also has enlarged teeth on the upper jaw. Unlike M. alfredi, M. birostris has a caudal spine near its dorsal fin. Mantas move through the water by the wing-like movements of their pectoral fins, which drive water backwards. Their large mouths are rectangular, and face forward as opposed to other ray and skate species with downward-facing mouths. The spiracles typical of rays are vestigial, and mantas must swim continuously to keep oxygenated water passing over their gills. The cephalic fins are usually spiraled but flatten during foraging. The fish's gill arches have pallets of pinkish-brown spongy tissue that collect food particles. Mantas track down prey using visual and olfactory senses. They have one of the highest brain-to-body mass ratios and the largest brain size of all fish. Their brains have retia mirabilia which may serve to keep them warm. M. alfredi has been shown to dive to depths over , while their relative Mobula tarapacana, which has a similar structure, dives to nearly ; the retia mirabilia probably serve to prevent their brains from being chilled during such dives into colder subsurface waters. =Lifecycle= M. alfredi group in the Maldives Mating takes place at different times of the year in different parts of the manta's range. Courtship is difficult to observe in this fast-swimming fish, although mating \\"trains\\" with multiple individuals swimming closely behind each other are sometimes seen in shallow water. The mating sequence may be triggered by a full moon and seems to be initiated by a male following closely behind a female while she travels at around . He makes repeated efforts to grasp her pectoral fin with his mouth, which may take 20 to 30 minutes. Once he has a tight grip, he turns upside-down and presses his ventral side against hers. He then inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca, where it remains for 60‚Äì90 seconds. The clasper forms a tube which channels sperm from the genital papilla; a siphon propels the seminal fluid into the oviduct. The male continues to grip the female's pectoral fin with his teeth for a further few minutes as both continue to swim, often followed by up to 20 other males. The pair then parts. For some reason, the male almost always grasps the left pectoral fin, and females often have scars that illustrate this. The fertilized eggs develop within the female's oviduct. At first, they are enclosed in an egg case while the developing embryos absorb the yolk. After hatching, the pups remain in the oviduct and receive additional nutrition from milky secretions. With no umbilical cord or placenta, the unborn pup relies on buccal pumping to obtain oxygen. Brood size is usually one or occasionally two. The gestation period is thought to be 12‚Äì13 months. When fully developed, the pup resembles a miniature adult and is expelled from the oviduct with no further parental care. In wild populations, an interval of two years between births may be normal, but a few individuals become pregnant in consecutive years, demonstrating an annual ovulatory cycle. The Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium has had some success in breeding M. alfredi, with one female giving birth in three successive years. In one of these pregnancies, the gestation period was 372 days and at birth the pup had a width of and weight of . In southern Africa, M. birostris males mature at while females reach maturity slightly over that. In Indonesia, M. birostris males appear to mature at , while female mature around . In southern Africa, M. alfredi matures at widths of for males and for females. In the Maldives, males of M. alfredi mature at a width of , while females mature at . In Hawaii, M. alfredi matures at a width of for males and for females. Female mantas appear to mature at 8‚Äì10 years. Manta rays may live as long as 50 years. =Behavior and ecology= M. alfredi foraging with mouth opened wide and cephalic fins spread Swimming behavior in mantas differs across habitats: when travelling over deep water, they swim at a constant rate in a straight line, while further inshore, they usually bask or swim idly around. Mantas may travel alone or in groups up to 50. They may associate with other fish species, as well as sea birds and marine mammals. Mantas sometimes breach, leaping partially or entirely out of the water. Individuals in a group may make aerial jumps one after the other. These leaps occur in three forms ‚Äì forward leaps where the fish lands head first, similar jumps with a tail first re-entry, or somersaults. The reason for breaching is not known; possible explanations include mating rituals, birthing, communication, or the removal of parasites and commensal remoras (suckerfish). M. alfredi at a coral reef cleaning station with fish picking off parasites Manta rays are filter feeders as well as macropredators. On the surface, they consume large quantities of zooplankton in the form of shrimp, krill, and planktonic crabs. In deeper depths, mantas consume small to medium-sized fish. When foraging, it slowly swims around its prey, herding it into a tight \\"ball\\", and then speeds through the bunched organisms with a wide-open mouth. If a ball is particularly dense, a manta may somersault through it. While feeding, mantas flatten their cephalic fins to channel food into their mouths and the small particles are collected by the tissue between the gill arches. As many as 50 individual fish may gather at a single, plankton-rich feeding site. Tests have shown that around 27 percent of the diet of M. birostris is from the surface while around 73 percent is at deeper depths. Mantas are themselves preyed upon by large sharks and by killer whales. They may also be bitten by cookiecutter sharks, and harbor parasitic copepods. Mantas visit cleaning stations on coral reefs for the removal of external parasites. The ray adopts a near-stationary position close to the coral surface for several minutes while the cleaner fish consume the attached organisms. Such visits most frequently occur when the tide is high. In Hawaii, wrasses provide the cleaning; some species feed around the manta's mouth and gill slits, while others address the rest of the body surface. In Mozambique, sergeant major fish clean the mouth, while butterflyfishes concentrate on bite wounds. M. alfredi visits cleaning stations more often than M. birostris. Individual mantas may revisit the same cleaning station or feeding area repeatedly and appear to have cognitive maps of their environment. In 2016, scientists published a study in which manta rays were shown to exhibit behavior associated with self-awareness. In a modified mirror test, the individuals engaged in contingency checking and unusual self-directed behavior. Distribution and habitat Mantas are found in tropical and subtropical waters in all the world's major oceans, and also venture into temperate seas. The furthest from the equator they have been recorded is North Carolina in the United States (31¬∞N) and the North Island of New Zealand (36¬∞S). They prefer water temperatures above and M. alfredi is predominantly found in tropical areas. Both species are pelagic. M. birostris lives mostly in the open ocean, travelling with the currents and migrating to areas where upwellings of nutrient-rich water increase prey concentrations. Fish that have been fitted with radio transmitters have traveled as far as from where they were caught, and descended to depths of at least . M. alfredi is a more resident and coastal species. Seasonal migrations do occur, but they are shorter than those of M. birostris. Mantas are common around coasts from spring to fall, but travel further offshore during the winter. They keep close to the surface and in shallow water in daytime, while at night they swim at greater depths. Conservation issues =Threats= The greatest threat to manta rays is overfishing. M. birostris is not evenly distributed over the oceans, but is concentrated in areas that provide the food resources it requires, while M. alfredi is even more localized. Their distributions are thus fragmented, with little evidence of intermingling of subpopulations. Because of their long lifespans and low reproductive rate, overfishing can severely reduce local populations with little likelihood that individuals from elsewhere will replace them. Both commercial and artisanal fisheries have targeted mantas for their meat and products. They are typically caught with nets, trawls, and harpoons. Mantas were once captured by fisheries in California and Australia for their liver oil and skin; the latter were used as abrasives. Their flesh is edible and is consumed in some countries, but is unattractive compared to other fish. Demand for their gill rakers, the cartilaginous structures protecting the gills, has recently entered Chinese medicine. To fill the growing demand in Asia for gill rakers, targeted fisheries have developed in the Philippines, Indonesia, Mozambique, Madagascar, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and Tanzania. Each year, thousands of manta rays, primarily M. birostris, are caught and killed purely for their gill rakers. A fisheries study in Sri Lanka and India estimated that over 1000 were being sold in the country's fish markets each year. By comparison, M. birostris populations at most of the key aggregation sites around the world are estimated to have significantly fewer than 1000 individuals. Targeted fisheries for manta rays in the Gulf of California, the west coast of Mexico, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines have reduced populations in these areas dramatically. Manta rays are subject to other anthropogenic threats. Because mantas must swim constantly to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, they are vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent suffocation. Mantas cannot swim backwards, and because of their protruding cephalic fins, are prone to entanglement in fishing lines, nets, ghost nets, and even loose mooring lines. When snared, mantas often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting, tangling themselves further. Loose, trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into its flesh, resulting in irreversible injury. Similarly, mantas become entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish. Some mantas are injured by collision with boats, especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed. Other threats or factors that may affect manta numbers are climate change, tourism, pollution from oil spills, and the ingestion of microplastics. =Status= M. birostris at Hin Daeng, near Phi Phi Islands, Thailand In 2011, mantas became strictly protected in international waters because of their inclusion in the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The CMS is an international treaty organization concerned with conserving migratory species and habitats on a global scale. Although individual nations were already protecting manta rays, the fish often migrate through unregulated waters, putting them at increased risk from overfishing. The IUCN declared M. birostris to be 'vulnerable with an elevated risk of extinction' in November 2011. In the same year, M. alfredi was also classified as vulnerable with local populations of fewer than 1000 individuals and little or no interchange between subpopulations. The Manta Trust is a UK-based charity dedicated to research and conservation efforts for manta rays. The organization's website is also an information resource for manta conservation and biology. Besides these international initiatives, some countries are taking their own actions. New Zealand has banned the taking of manta rays since the introduction of the Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing, as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the taking of mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. Fish stocks were surveyed in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of mantas in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucat√°n Peninsula, where manta rays are used to attract tourists. In 2009, Hawaii became the first of the United States to introduce a ban on the killing or capturing of manta rays. Previously, no fishery for mantas existed in the state but migratory fish that pass the islands are now protected. In 2010, Ecuador introduced a law prohibiting all fishing for manta and other rays, their retention as bycatch and their sale. Relation with humans Ceramic manta ray made by Moche people, 200 AD, alt=Photo of manta-shaped ceramic vessel with painting of another on its surface The ancient Peruvian Moche people worshipped the sea and its animals. Their art often depicts manta rays. Historically, mantas were feared for their size and power. Sailors believed that they were dangerous to humans and could sink boats by pulling on the anchors. This attitude changed around 1978, when divers around the Gulf of California found them to be placid and that they could interact with the animals. Several divers photographed themselves with mantas, including Jaws author Peter Benchley. =Aquariums= Manta alfredi at Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium Due to their size, mantas are rarely kept in captivity and few aquaria currently display them. One notable individual is \\"Nandi\\", a manta ray which was accidentally caught in shark nets off Durban, South Africa, in 2007. Rehabilitated and outgrowing her aquarium at uShaka Marine World, Nandi was moved to the larger Georgia Aquarium in August 2008, where she resides in its 23,848 m3 (6,300,000 US gal) \\"Ocean Voyager\\" exhibit. A second manta ray joined that aquarium's collection in September 2009 and a third was added in 2010. The Atlantis resort on Paradise Island, Bahamas, hosted a manta named \\"Zeus\\" that was used as a research subject for 3 years until it was released in 2008. The Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium also houses manta rays in the \\"Kuroshio Sea\\" tank, one of the largest aquarium tanks in the world. The first manta ray birth in captivity took place there in 2007. Although this pup did not survive, the aquarium has since had the birth of three more manta rays in 2008, 2009, and 2010. =Tourism= Manta alfredi and scuba diver Sites at which manta rays congregate attract tourists, and manta viewing generates substantial annual revenue for local communities. Tourist sites exist in the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Spain, the Fiji Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, Hawaii, Western Australia and the Maldives. Mantas are popular because of their enormous size and because they are easily habituated to humans. Scuba divers may get a chance to watch mantas visiting cleaning stations and night dives enable viewers to see mantas feeding on plankton attracted by the lights. M. alfredi during a dive at Hawaii Ray tourism benefits locals and visitors by raising awareness of natural resource management and educating them about the animals. It can also provide funds for research and conservation. Constant unregulated interactions with tourists can negatively affect the fish by disrupting ecological relationships and increasing disease transmission. At Bora Bora, an excessive number of swimmers, boaters, and jet skiers caused the local manta ray population to abandon the area. In 2014, Indonesia brought in a fishing and export ban, as it has realized that manta ray tourism is more economically beneficial than allowing the fish to be killed. A dead manta is worth $40 to $500, while manta ray tourism can bring in $1 million during the life of a single manta ray. Indonesia has 5.8 million km2 (2.2 million mi2) of ocean, and this is now the world's largest sanctuary for manta rays.

Income tax generally is computed as the product of a tax rate times taxable income. Taxation rates may vary by type or characteristics of the taxpayer. The tax rate may increase as taxable income increases (referred to as graduated or progressive rates). The tax imposed on companies is usually known as corporate tax and is levied at a flat rate. Individual income is often taxed at progressive rates where the tax rate applied to each additional unit of currency increases (e.g. the first $10000 of income taxed at 0%, the next $10000 taxed at 1%, etc...). Most jurisdictions exempt locally organized charitable organizations from tax. Income from investment income may be taxed at different (generally lower) rates than other income. Credits of various sorts may be allowed that reduce tax. Some jurisdictions impose the higher of an income tax or a tax on an alternative base or measure of income. Taxable income of taxpayers resident in the jurisdiction is generally total income less income producing expenses and other deductions. Generally, only net gain from sale of property, including goods held for sale, is included in income. Income of a corporation's shareholders usually includes distributions of profits from the corporation. Deductions typically include all income producing or business expenses including an allowance for recovery of costs of business assets. Many jurisdictions allow notional deductions for individuals, and may allow deduction of some personal expenses. Most jurisdictions either do not tax income earned outside the jurisdiction or allow a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions on such income. Nonresidents are taxed only on certain types of income from sources within the jurisdictions, with few exceptions. Most jurisdictions require self-assessment of the tax and require payers of some types of income to withhold tax from those payments. Advance payments of tax by taxpayers may be required. Taxpayers not timely paying tax owed are generally subject to significant penalties, which may include jail for individuals or revocation of an entity's legal existence. History Top marginal tax rate of the income tax (i.e. the maximum rate of taxation applied to the highest part of income) The concept of taxing income is a modern innovation and presupposes several things: a money economy, reasonably accurate accounts, a common understanding of receipts, expenses and profits, and an orderly society with reliable records. For most of the history of civilization, these preconditions did not exist, and taxes were based on other factors. Taxes on wealth, social position, and ownership of the means of production (typically land and slaves) were all common. Practices such as tithing, or an offering of first fruits, existed from ancient times, and can be regarded as a precursor of the income tax, but they lacked precision and certainly were not based on a concept of net increase. =Early examples= The first income tax is generally attributed to Egypt.2 Breasted, Ancient Records, Volume 2, paragraph 719-742 In the early days of the Roman Republic, public taxes consisted of modest assessments on owned wealth and property. The tax rate under normal circumstances was 1% and sometimes would climb as high as 3% in situations such as war. These modest taxes were levied against land, homes and other real estate, slaves, animals, personal items and monetary wealth. The more a person had in property, the more tax they paid. Taxes were collected from individuals.Roman Taxes. Unrv.com. Retrieved on 2014-04-12. In the year 10 AD, Emperor Wang Mang of the Xin Dynasty instituted an unprecedented income tax, at the rate of 10 percent of profits, for professionals and skilled labor. He was overthrown 13 years later in 23 AD and earlier policies were restored during the reestablished Han Dynasty which followed. One of the first recorded taxes on income was the Saladin tithe introduced by Henry II in 1188 to raise money for the Third Crusade. The tithe demanded that each layperson in England and Wales be taxed one tenth of their personal income and moveable property. =Modern era= United Kingdom William Pitt the Younger introduced a progressive income tax in 1798. The inception date of the modern income tax is typically accepted as 1799, at the suggestion of Henry Beeke, the future Dean of Bristol. This income tax was introduced into Great Britain by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger in his budget of December 1798, to pay for weapons and equipment for the French Revolutionary War. Pitt's new graduated (progressive) income tax began at a levy of 2 old pence in the pound (1/120) on incomes over ¬£60 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), and increased up to a maximum of 2 shillings in the pound (10%) on incomes of over ¬£200. Pitt hoped that the new income tax would raise ¬£10 million a year, but actual receipts for 1799 totalled only a little over ¬£6 million. Pitt's income tax was levied from 1799 to 1802, when it was abolished by Henry Addington during the Peace of Amiens. Addington had taken over as prime minister in 1801, after Pitt's resignation over Catholic Emancipation. The income tax was reintroduced by Addington in 1803 when hostilities with France recommenced, but it was again abolished in 1816, one year after the Battle of Waterloo. Opponents of the tax, who thought it should only be used to finance wars, wanted all records of the tax destroyed along with its repeal. Records were publicly burned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but copies were retained in the basement of the tax court.Adams, Charles 1998. Those Dirty Rotten TAXES, The Free Press, New York, NY Punch cartoon (1907); illustrates the unpopularity amongst Punch readers of a proposed 1907 income tax by the Labour Party in the United Kingdom.upright In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, income tax was reintroduced by Sir Robert Peel by the Income Tax Act 1842. Peel, as a Conservative, had opposed income tax in the 1841 general election, but a growing budget deficit required a new source of funds. The new income tax, based on Addington's model, was imposed on incomes above ¬£150 (equivalent to ¬£ in ),. Although this measure was initially intended to be temporary, it soon became a fixture of the British taxation system. A committee was formed in 1851 under Joseph Hume to investigate the matter, but failed to reach a clear recommendation. Despite the vociferous objection, William Gladstone, Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1852, kept the progressive income tax, and extended it to cover the costs of the Crimean War. By the 1860s, the progressive tax had become a grudgingly accepted element of the United Kingdom fiscal system. United States The US federal government imposed the first personal income tax on August 5, 1861, to help pay for its war effort in the American Civil War - (3% of all incomes over US$800) (equivalent to $ in ).Revenue Act of 1861, sec. 49, ch. 45, 12 Stat. 292, 309 (Aug. 5, 1861). This tax was repealed and replaced by another income tax in 1862.Sections 49, 51, and part of 50 repealed by Revenue Act of 1862, sec. 89, ch. 119, 12 Stat. 432, 473 (July 1, 1862); income taxes imposed under Revenue Act of 1862, section 86 (pertaining to salaries of officers, or payments to \\"persons in the civil, military, naval, or other employment or service of the United States ...\\") and section 90 (pertaining to \\"the annual gains, profits, or income of every person residing in the United States, whether derived from any kind of property, rents, interest, dividends, salaries, or from any profession, trade, employment or vocation carried on in the United States or elsewhere, or from any other source whatever....\\"). It was only in 1894 that the first peacetime income tax was passed through the Wilson-Gorman tariff. The rate was 2% on income over $4000 (equivalent to $ in ), which meant fewer than 10% of households would pay any. The purpose of the income tax was to make up for revenue that would be lost by tariff reductions. The US Supreme Court ruled the income tax unconstitutional, the 10th amendment forbidding any powers not expressed in the US Constitution, and there being no power to impose any other than a direct tax by apportionment. In 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution made the income tax a permanent fixture in the U.S. tax system. In fiscal year 1918, annual internal revenue collections for the first time passed the billion-dollar mark, rising to $5.4 billion by 1920. The amount of income collected via income tax has varied dramatically, from 1% in the early days of US income tax to taxation rates of over 90% during WW2.

Tax systems in Canada, China, Germany, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States, among others, follow most of the principles outlined below. Some tax systems, such as India, may have significant differences from the principles outlined below. Most references below are examples; see specific articles by jurisdiction (e.g., Income tax in Australia). =Taxpayers and rates= Individuals are often taxed at different rates than corporations. Individuals include only human beings. Tax systems in countries other than the USA treat an entity as a corporation only if it is legally organized as a corporation. Estates and trusts are usually subject to special tax provisions. Other taxable entities are generally treated as partnerships. In the US, many kinds of entities may elect to be treated as a corporation or a partnership. Partners of partnerships are treated as having income, deductions, and credits equal to their shares of such partnership items. Separate taxes are assessed against each taxpayer meeting certain minimum criteria. Many systems allow married individuals to request joint assessment. Many systems allow controlled groups of locally organized corporations to be jointly assessed. Tax rates vary widely. Some systems impose higher rates on higher amounts of income. Example: Elbonia taxes income below E.10,000 at 20% and other income at 30%. Joe has E.15,000 of income. His tax is E.3,500. Tax rates schedules may vary for individuals based on marital status.See, e.g., rates under the Germany and United States systems. In India on the other hand there is a slab rate system, where for income below INR 2.5 lakhs per annum the tax is zero percent, for those with their income in the slab rate of INR 2,50,001 to INR 5,00,000 the tax rate is 5%. In this way the rate goes up with each slab, reaching to 30% tax rate for those with income above INR 15,00,000. =Residents and nonresidents= Residents are generally taxed differently from nonresidents. Few jurisdictions tax nonresidents other than on specific types of income earned within the jurisdiction. See, e.g., the discussion of taxation by the United States of foreign persons. Residents, however, are generally subject to income tax on all worldwide income.The German system is typical in this regard. A handful of countries (notably Singapore and Hong Kong) tax residents only on income earned in or remitted to the country. There may arise a situation where the tax payer has to pay tax in one country where he is tax resident and also pay tax to other country where he is nonresident. This creates the situation of Double taxation which needs assessment of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement entered by the countries where the tax payer is assessed as resident and nonresident for the same transaction. Residence is often defined for individuals as presence in the country for more than 183 days. Most countries base residence of entities on either place of organization or place of management and control. The United Kingdom has three levels of residence. =Defining income= Most systems define income subject to tax broadly for residents, but tax nonresidents only on specific types of income. What is included in income for individuals may differ from what is included for entities. The timing of recognizing income may differ by type of taxpayer or type of income. Income generally includes most types of receipts that enrich the taxpayer, including compensation for services, gain from sale of goods or other property, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, annuities, pensions, and all manner of other items.See, e.g., gross income in the United States. Many systems exclude from income part or all of superannuation or other national retirement plan payments. Most tax systems exclude from income health care benefits provided by employers or under national insurance systems. =Deductions allowed= Nearly all income tax systems permit residents to reduce gross income by business and some other types of deductions. By contrast, nonresidents are generally subject to income tax on the gross amount of income of most types plus the net business income earned within the jurisdiction. Expenses incurred in a trading, business, rental, or other income producing activity are generally deductible, though there may be limitations on some types of expenses or activities. Business expenses include all manner of costs for the benefit of the activity. An allowance (as a capital allowance or depreciation deduction) is nearly always allowed for recovery of costs of assets used in the activity. Rules on capital allowances vary widely, and often permit recovery of costs more quickly than ratably over the life of the asset. Most systems allow individuals some sort of notional deductions or an amount subject to zero tax. In addition, many systems allow deduction of some types of personal expenses, such as home mortgage interest or medical expenses. =Business profits= Only net income from business activities, whether conducted by individuals or entities is taxable, with few exceptions. Many countries require business enterprises to prepare financial statementsSee, e.g., UK requirements which must be audited. Tax systems in those countries often define taxable income as income per those financial statements with few, if any, adjustments. A few jurisdictions compute net income as a fixed percentage of gross revenues for some types of businesses, particularly branches of nonresidents. =Credits= Nearly all systems permit residents a credit for income taxes paid to other jurisdictions of the same sort. Thus, a credit is allowed at the national level for income taxes paid to other countries. Many income tax systems permit other credits of various sorts, and such credits are often unique to the jurisdiction. =Alternative taxes= Some jurisdictions, particularly the United States and many of its states and Switzerland, impose the higher of regular income tax or an alternative tax. Switzerland and U.S. states generally impose such tax only on corporations and base it on capital or a similar measure. =Administration= Income tax is generally collected in one of two ways: through withholding of tax at source and/or through payments directly by taxpayers. Nearly all jurisdictions require those paying employees or nonresidents to withhold income tax from such payments. The amount to be withheld is a fixed percentage where the tax itself is at a fixed rate. Alternatively, the amount to be withheld may be determined by the tax administration of the country or by the payer using formulas provided by the tax administration. Payees are generally required to provide to the payer or the government the information needed to make the determinations. Withholding for employees is often referred to as \\"pay as you earn\\" (PAYE) or \\"pay as you go.\\" Income taxes of workers are often collected by employers under a withholding or pay-as-you-earn tax system. Such collections are not necessarily final amounts of tax, as the worker may be required to aggregate wage income with other income and/or deductions to determine actual tax. Calculation of the tax to be withheld may be done by the government or by employers based on withholding allowances or formulas. Nearly all systems require those whose proper tax is not fully settled through withholding to self-assess tax and make payments prior to or with final determination of the tax. Self-assessment means the taxpayer must make a computation of tax and submit it to the government. Some countries provide a pre-computed estimate to taxpayers, which the taxpayer can correct as necessary. The proportion of people who pay their income taxes in full, on time, and voluntarily (that is, without being fined or ordered to pay more by the government) is called the voluntary compliance rate. The voluntary compliance rate is higher in the US than in countries like Germany or Italy. In countries with a sizeable black market, the voluntary compliance rate is very low and may be impossible to properly calculate. =State, provincial, and local= Income taxes are separately imposed by sub-national jurisdictions in several countries with federal systems. These include Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and the United States, where provinces, cantons, or states impose separate taxes. In a few countries, cities also impose income taxes. The system may be integrated (as in Germany) with taxes collected at the federal level. In Quebec and the United States, federal and state systems are independently administered and have differences in determination of taxable income. =Wage-based taxes= Retirement oriented taxes, such as Social Security or national insurance, also are a type of income tax, though not generally referred to as such. In the US, these taxes generally are imposed at a fixed rate on wages or self-employment earnings up to a maximum amount per year. The tax may be imposed on the employer, the employee, or both, at the same or different rates. Some jurisdictions also impose a tax collected from employers, to fund unemployment insurance, health care, or similar government outlays. Economic and policy aspects General government revenue, in % of GDP, from personal income taxes. For this data, the variance of GDP per capita with purchasing power parity (PPP) is explained in 27 % by tax revenue Multiple conflicting theories have been proposed regarding the economic impact of income taxes.See, e.g., references in Tax#Economic effects, Economics#Macroeconomics, Fiscal policy Income taxes are widely viewed as a progressive tax (the incidence of tax increases as income increases). Some studies have suggested that an income tax doesn't have much effect on the numbers of hours worked.Killingsworth 1983 and Pencavel 1986 =Criticisms= Tax avoidance strategies and loopholes tend to emerge within income tax codes. They get created when taxpayers find legal methods to avoid paying taxes. Lawmakers then attempt to close the loopholes with additional legislation. That leads to a vicious cycle of ever more complex avoidance strategies and legislation.Why are taxes so complicated?, Retrieved 19 August 2013 The vicious cycle tends to benefit large corporations and wealthy individuals that can afford the professional fees that come with ever more sophisticated tax planning,How to Pay No Taxes: 10 Strategies Used by the Rich, Retrieved 19 August 2013 thus challenging the notion that even a marginal income tax system can be properly called progressive. The higher costs to labour and capital imposed by income tax causes deadweight loss in an economy, being the loss of economic activity from people deciding not to invest capital or use time productively because of the burden that tax would impose on those activities. There is also a loss from individuals and professional advisors devoting time to tax-avoiding behaviour instead of economically-productive activities.Deadweight Loss Of Taxation, Retrieved 19 August 2013. Around the world Systems of taxation on personal income Payroll and income tax by OECD Country Income taxes are used in most countries around the world. The tax systems vary greatly and can be progressive, proportional, or regressive, depending on the type of tax. Comparison of tax rates around the world is a difficult and somewhat subjective enterprise. Tax laws in most countries are extremely complex, and tax burden falls differently on different groups in each country and sub-national unit. Of course, services provided by governments in return for taxation also vary, making comparisons all the more difficult. Countries that tax income generally use one of two systems: territorial or residential. In the territorial system, only local income ‚Äì income from a source inside the country ‚Äì is taxed. In the residential system, residents of the country are taxed on their worldwide (local and foreign) income, while nonresidents are taxed only on their local income. In addition, a very small number of countries, notably the United States, also tax their nonresident citizens on worldwide income. Countries with a residential system of taxation usually allow deductions or credits for the tax that residents already pay to other countries on their foreign income. Many countries also sign tax treaties with each other to eliminate or reduce double taxation. Countries do not necessarily use the same system of taxation for individuals and corporations. For example, France uses a residential system for individuals but a territorial system for corporations,International tax - France Highlights 2012 , Deloitte. while Singapore does the opposite,International tax - Singapore Highlights 2012 , Deloitte. and Brunei taxes corporate but not personal income.International tax - Brunei Darussalam 2012, Deloitte.

The major part of his career was spent at the Rockefeller Hospital in New York City. Avery was one of the first molecular biologists and a pioneer in immunochemistry, but he is best known for the experiment (published in 1944 with his co-workers Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty) that isolated DNA as the material of which genes and chromosomes are made. The Nobel laureate Arne Tiselius said that Avery was the most deserving scientist not to receive the Nobel Prize for his work, though he was nominated for the award throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. The lunar crater Avery was named in his honor. Early life and education Avery was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1877 to Francis Joseph Avery, a Baptist minister, and his wife Elizabeth Crowdy. The couple had immigrated from Britain in 1873. Oswald Avery was born and grew up in a small wooden row house on Moran Street in the North End of Halifax, now a designated heritage building.\\"Avery House\\", Canada's Historic Places When Avery was 10, his family moved to the Lower East Side of New York City. Avery earned his undergraduate degree at Colgate University and was a member of the Class of 1900. Avery studied music at first and then switched to medicine at college, earning his medical degree and beginning a practice in 1904.Rene Dubos, \\"Fess Avery: The Man and the Scientist\\", Institute to University: A Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Colloquium June 8, 1973, The Rockefeller University (1977) p. 46-49. Rockefeller Institute In 1912, Rufus Cole, who had noticed some of Avery's publications, offered him a position at the recently opened Rockefeller Hospital, a facility for clinical research and part of the Rockefeller Institute. Avery accepted. At the institute, Cole, Avery and Alphonse Dochez developed the first effective immune serum against a strain of pneumococcus, a bacterium causing pneumonia. The serum was produced from the blood of infected horses. Debate over the pathogen in the 1918 influenza epidemic At the height of the 1918 influenza epidemic, the dominant hypothesis was that the causative agent in the disease was a bacterium ‚Äî specifically, Haemophilus influenzae (then called 'Pfeiffer's bacillus' or Bacillus influenzae), a microbe first isolated by German bacteriologist Richard Pfeiffer, which he had identified in nasal samples of patients infected by seasonal influenza decades earlier and which was also found in many but not all samples taken from patients in the 1918 epidemic. The failure to isolate B. influenzae in some patients was generally attributed to the difficulty of culturing the bacterium. Peter Olitsky and Frederick Gates at the Rockefeller Institute found that nasal secretions from infected patients could still cause disease in the lungs of rabbits after having been filtered through a bacterium- excluding Berkefeld filter, but other researchers were unable to reproduce their results. Avery initially doubted Olitsky's and Gates's data, and set out to prove the B. influenzae hypothesis. For that purpose, he developed improved culture media for B. influenzae, which were widely adopted and reduced the possibility of false negatives. However, B. influenzae could still not be found in all influenza patients. The true cause of influenza, a virus, would not be discovered until the 1930s. DNA as the basis for genes After the influenza epidemic, Avery returned to his work on pneumococcus. He identified R and S strains of the bacterium; the latter caused disease and had a polysaccharide capsule, while the former lacked the capsule and was harmless. Griffith's experiment of 1928 showed that the ability to produce a capsule could be transferred from S to R strain bacteria, even if the S strain bacteria were killed first. For many years, genetic information was thought to be contained in cell protein. Continuing the research done by Frederick Griffith, Avery worked with Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty on the mystery of inheritance. He had received emeritus status from the Rockefeller Institute in 1943, but continued working for five years, though by that time he was in his late sixties. Techniques were available to remove various organic compounds from bacteria, and if the remaining organic compounds were still able to cause R strain bacteria to transform then the substances removed could not be the carrier of genes. S-bacteria first had the large cellular structures removed. Then they were treated with protease enzymes, which removed the proteins from the cells before the remainder was placed with R strain bacteria. The R strain bacteria transformed, meaning that proteins did not carry the genes causing disease. Then the remnants of the S strain bacteria were treated with a deoxyribonuclease enzyme which removed the DNA. After this treatment, the R strain bacteria no longer transformed. This showed that DNA was the substance that transformed R strain into S strain bacteria and indicated that it was the carrier of genes in cells. Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase furthered Avery's research in 1952 with the Hershey‚ÄìChase experiment. These experiments paved the way for Watson and Crick's discovery of the helical structure of DNA, and thus the birth of modern genetics and molecular biology. Of this event, Avery wrote in a letter to his youngest brother Roy, a bacteriologist at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine: \\"It's lots of fun to blow bubbles but it's wiser to prick them yourself before someone else tries to.\\"Davies, Kevin (2001). Cracking the Genome: Inside the Race to Unlock Human DNA. The Free Press. Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg stated that Avery and his laboratory provided \\"the historical platform of modern DNA research\\" and \\"betokened the molecular revolution in genetics and biomedical science generally\\". Avery is best known for his discovery in 1944, that DNA is the material of which genes and chromosomes are made.

Early career Salutati was born in Stignano, a tiny commune near Buggiano (today's province of Pistoia, Tuscany). After studies in Bologna, where his father lived in exile after a Ghibelline coup in Buggiano, the family returned to Buggiano, which had become more securely part of the Republic of Florence. There he worked as notary and pursued his literary studies, coming into contact with the Florentine humanists Boccaccio and Francesco Nelli. The refined and masterful classical Latin of his letters to Florentine scholars earned him the admiring nickname of \\"Ape of Cicero\\",Italian \\"Scimmia di Cicerone\\", with implied praise. In 1367 Coluccio was appointed chancellor of Todi in the Papal States. Papal secretary Francesco Bruni took Salutati with him to Rome from 1368 to 1370, as assistant in the Papal curia of Pope Urban V recently returned from Avignon.The Avignonese papacy lasted from 1305 to 1367. In 1370, through his connections in the curia he was made chancellor of the powerful Tuscan city of Lucca, a post he quickly lost in internecine struggles there.Witt, 2000:2. Chancellor of Florence In 1374 Coluccio received an appointment in Florence and the following year was appointed Chancellor of Florence, the most important position in the bureaucracy of the Florentine Republic. In his position, Salutati was responsible for the widely circulated official correspondences with other states, drafting confidential instructions to ambassadors, conducting diplomacy and negotiating treaties: \\"in its chancellor Florence had someone truly exceptional, endowed not only with legal knowledge, political cunning and diplomatic skill, but also with psychological penetration, a gift for public relations, and unusual literary skill.\\"Stephen Greenblatt, The Swerve: how the world became modern, 2011:123.

Page 305 Salutati was charged with addressing Pope Gregory XI to assure him that Florence was still a loyal member of the Guelf party.Witt, 2000:305 Although he failed to prevent war with the papacy, Salutati soon became the most celebrated chancellor in all of Italy and a master of the formal letter. Florence's principal nemesis during his tenure, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan, once remarked that one of Salutati's letters could \\"cause more damage than a thousand Florentine horsemen.\\"Gundersheimer, Werner L. The Italian Renaissance. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall. 1965. Page 13 During his life, Florence warred twice against its powerful northern rival, Giangaleazzo Visconti. His treatise De tyranno (\\"On the tyrant\\") published in 1400, has, most likely, its model in Visconti, although in it Salutati (despite being a republican) remains a supporter of the providential universal monarch already put forward by Dante. Occasionally his letters had unintended consequences. When he wrote to the people of Ancona in 1376, inciting them, in the name of their freedom, to revolt against the governor imposed by the pope, he called to mind the evils Italy had suffered on behalf of the French. Word of his nasty tone got to the King of France, which prompted a most conciliatory letter from Salutati, assuring the King that he meant no harm and that Florence would always be a friend to France.Witt, 2000:313. In testimony to his service as chancellor the city of Florence paid 250 florins for his funeral in 1406.Caferro, William. John Hawkwood. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins. 2006. Page 315 Cultural achievements Coluccio's cultural achievements are perhaps even greater than his political ones. A skilled writer and orator, Coluccio drew heavily upon the classical tradition and developed a powerful prose style based on the Latin of Virgil and Cicero: \\"I have always believed,\\" Salutati wrote, \\"I must imitate antiquity not simply to reproduce it, but in order to produce something new\\".Lauro Martines, The Social World of the Florentine Humanists, 1390‚Äì1460 :(Princeton) 1963:25. In this sense his own view of humanism was broader-based than the antiquarianism of the generation of humanists he fostered.Observed in Greenblatt 2011: An admiring correspondent of Petrarch, he spent much of his salary on amassing a collection of 800 books, slightly less than his contemporary Niccol√≤ de' Niccoli. He also pursued classical manuscripts, making a number of important discoveries, the most important being Cicero's lost Letters to his Friends (Epistulae ad Familiares), which showed Cicero as a defender of republican liberty. Coluccio also did important studies of history, tying Florence's origin not to the Roman Empire but to the Roman Republic. He promoted the work of younger humanists such as Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini, Niccol√≤ de' Niccoli, Leonardo Bruni and Pier Paolo Vergerio. He also brought the Byzantine scholar Manuel Chrysoloras to Florence in 1397 to teach one of the first courses in Greek since the end of the Roman Empire. After Boethius, few Westerners spoke or read Greek. Many ancient Greek works of science and philosophy were not available in Latin translation. By Salutati's time, a few Latin texts of Aristotle had arrived in Europe via Muslim Spain and Sicily. These texts, however, had been translated from Arabic, rather than directly from the Greek. By bringing Chrysoloras to Florence, Salutati made it possible for a select group of scholars (including Bruni and Vergerio) to read Aristotle and Plato in the original ancient Greek.Griffiths, Gordon, Hankins, James, and Thompson, David.

He was the founding patron of the Certosa di Pavia, completing the Visconti Castle at Pavia begun by his father and furthering work on the Duomo of Milan. Biography During his patronage of the Visconti Castle, he contributed to the growth of the collection of scientific treatises and richly illuminated manuscripts in the Visconti Library.Hoeniger, Cathleen.

His father possessed the signoria of the city of Pavia. In 1385 Gian Galeazzo gained control of Milan by overthrowing his uncle Bernab√≤ through treacherous means by faking a religious conversion and ambushing him during a religious procession in Milan.John T. Paoletta and Gary M. Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy He imprisoned his uncle who soon died, supposedly poisoned on his orders.Barbara Tuchman A Distant Mirror A.A.Knopf, New York (1978) p.418 Marriage and issue His first marriage was to Isabelle of Valois, who brought him the title of comte de Vertus in Champagne, rendered in Italian as Conte di Virt√π, the title by which he was known in his early career. They had: *Gian Galeazzo (b. Pavia, 4 March 1366 ‚Äì d. bef. 1376). *Azzone (b. Pavia, 1368 ‚Äì d. Pavia, 4 October 1381). *Valentina (b. Pavia, 1371 ‚Äì d.

After Galeazzo's wife Isabelle died in childbirth in 1373, he married secondly, on 2 October 1380, his first cousin Caterina Visconti, daughter of Bernab√≤; with her he had: *Gian Maria *Filippo Maria Conflict with France Galeazzo was a devoted father to his daughter Valentina. He reacted to gossip about Valentina at the French Court by threatening to declare war on France. The wife of King Charles VI of France was Isabeau of Bavaria, the granddaughter of Bernab√≤ Visconti, and, thus, a bitter rival of Valentina and her father Gian Galeazzo Visconti. Galeazzo's role as a statesman also took other forms. Soon after seizing Milan he took Verona, Vicenza, and Padua, establishing himself as Signore of each, and soon controlled almost the entire valley of the Po, including Piacenza where in 1393 he gave the feudal power to Confalonieri Family on the lands they already had in the valleys around Piacenza. He lost Padua in 1390, when it reverted to Francesco Novello da Carrara. He received the title of Duke of Milan from Wenceslaus, King of the Romans in 1395 for 100,000 florins. In 1396, after the disaster of Nicopolis, Galeazzo was strongly suspected of having informed the Ottomans of the crusaders' plans and of the size and strength of their army as vengeance for his daughter being accused of being behind the illness of King Charles VI of France, and for France's increasing control over the city of Genoa that he had attempted to hamper, for which he had been rebuked by Enguerrand VII de Coucy before the battle. In 1400, Gian Galeazzo appointed a host of clerks and departments entrusted with improving the public health. For the new system of administration and bookkeeping this established, he is credited with creating the first modern bureaucracy, with the assistance of his Chancellor Francesco Barbavara. Uniting Italy Gian Galeazzo had dreams of uniting all of northern Italy into one kingdom, a revived Lombard empire. Obstacles included Bologna and especially Florence. In 1402, Gian Galeazzo launched assaults upon these cities. The warfare was extremely costly on both sides, but it was universally believed the Milanese would emerge victorious. The Florentine leaders, especially the chancellor Coluccio Salutati worked successfully to rally the people of Florence, but the Florentines were being taxed hard by famine, disease, and poverty. Galeazzo won another victory over the Bolognese at the Battle of Casalecchio on 26 June 1402. Galeazzo's dreams were to come to naught, however, as he succumbed to a fever at the castello of Melegnano on 10 August 1402. He died on 3 September. His empire fragmented as infighting among his successors wrecked Milan, partly through his division of his lands among both legitimate and illegitimate children. Gian Galeazzo spent 300,000 golden florins in attempting to turn from their courses the rivers Mincio from Mantua and the Brenta from Padua, in order to render those cities helpless before the force of his arms. Notable are his library, housed in the grandest princely dwelling in Italy, the castello in Pavia, and his rich collection of manuscripts, many of them the fruits of his conquests. Furious at French political maneuvering that had removed Genoa from his influence, Gian Galeazzo had been attempting to stop the transfer of Genoese sovereignty to France and Coucy was dispatched to warn him that France would consider further interference a hostile act. The quarrel was more than political. Valentina Visconti, the wife of the Duke of Orleans and Gian Galeazzo's beloved daughter, had been exiled from Paris due to the machinations of Queen Isabeau the same month as the departure of the crusade. The Duke of Milan threatened to send knights to defend his daughter's honor but, in the wake of the disaster at Nicopolis, it was widely believed that he had relayed intelligence to Bayezid I of crusader troop movements. There is no firm evidence of this and it is likely that Gian Galeazzo became a scapegoat after the fact due to the existing animosity with France, though there remains the possibility that the Duke of Milan, who had murdered his own uncle to ensure his own power, did in fact betray the crusaders. Coucy, his diplomatic mission complete and accompanied by Henry of Bar and their followers, left Milan for Venice, from where he requisitioned a ship on 17 May to take him across the Adriatic Sea, landing in the Croatian port of Senj on 30 May before making his way overland to the rendezvous in Buda.

He was born Georgius Florentius and later added the name Gregorius in honour of his maternal great-grandfather. He is the primary contemporary source for Merovingian history. His most notable work was his Decem Libri Historiarum (Ten Books of Histories), better known as the Historia Francorum (History of the Franks), a title that later chroniclers gave to it, but he is also known for his accounts of the miracles of saints, especially four books of the miracles of Martin of Tours. St. Martin's tomb was a major pilgrimage destination in the 6th century, and St. Gregory's writings had the practical effect of promoting this highly organized devotion. Biography Gregory was born in Clermont, in the Auvergne region of central Gaul.Butler, Alban. The Lives of the Saints, Vol. XI, 1866 He was born into the upper stratum of Gallo-Roman society as the son of Florentius, Senator of Clermont, by his wife Armentaria II, niece of Bishop Nicetius of Lyons and granddaughter of both Florentinus, Senator of Geneva, and Saint Gregory of Langres. Gregory had several noted bishops and saints as close relatives (his family effectively monopolised the Bishoprics of Tours, Lyons, and Langres at the time of his birth), and, according to Gregory, he was connected to thirteen of the eighteen bishops of Tours preceding him by ties of kinship. Gregory's paternal grandmother, Leocadia, descended from Vettius Epagatus, the illustrious martyr of Lyons. His father evidently died while Gregory was young and his widowed mother moved to Burgundy where she had property. Gregory went to live with his paternal uncle St. Gallus, Bishop of Clermont), under whom, and his successor St. Avitus, Gregory had his education. Gregory also received the clerical tonsure from Gallus. Having contracted a serious illness, he made a visit of devotion to the tomb of St. Martin at Tours. Upon his recovery, he began to pursue a clerical career and was ordained deacon by Avitus. Upon the death of St. Euphronius, he was chosen as bishop by the clergy and people, who had been charmed with his piety, learning, and humility. Their deputies overtook him at the court of King Sigebert of Austrasia, and being compelled to acquiesce, though much against his will, Gregory was consecrated by Giles, Bishop of Rheims, on 22 August 573, at the age of thirty-four. He spent most of his career at Tours, although he assisted at the council of Paris in 577. The rough world he lived in was on the cusp of the dying world of Antiquity and the new culture of early medieval Europe. Gregory lived also on the border between the Frankish culture of the Merovingians to the north and the Gallo- Roman culture of the south of Gaul. Realms of Merovingian Gaul at the death of Clovis (511 AD). At Tours, Gregory could not have been better placed to hear everything and meet everyone of influence in Merovingian culture. Tours lay on the watery highway of the navigable Loire. Five Roman roads radiated from Tours, which lay on the main thoroughfare between the Frankish north and Aquitania, with Spain beyond. At Tours the Frankish influences of the north and the Gallo-Roman influences of the south had their chief contact (see map). As the center for the popular cult of St Martin, Tours was a pilgrimage site, hospital, and a political sanctuary to which important leaders fled during periods of violence and turmoil in Merovingian politics. Gregory struggled through personal relations with four Frankish kings, Sigebert I, Chilperic I, Guntram, and Childebert II and he personally knew most of the leading Franks. Works Gregory wrote in Late Latin which departed from classical usage frequently in syntax and spelling with relatively few changes in inflection.Sandys, John Edwin. History of Classical Scholarship, Vol I. 434-435. Cambridge: CUP, 1903. Frontispice of Historia Francorum. =History of the Franks= Summary- note- this is only a cursory summary of the major events in the royal Merovingian Dynasty. Gregory of Tours history is a dense work, full of numerous narratives and characters. Gregorys history contains christian tales of miracles, descriptions of omens/ natural events, stories of christian martyrs, dialogues of church debates, lives of holy men, lives of the nobility, lives of eccentric peasants, frequent bible verses and references, complex international relations between numerous tribes and nations including : the lombards, visigoths, Ostrogoths, Huns, etc..., not to mention Gregories personal biography and interpretation of events. Book I Begins with the a pronouncement of by the author, the Bishop of Tours, Gregorys faith. That he is a Frankish Catholic clergyman who follows the Nicence Creed, and abhors heresy like those of ‚Äúwicked‚Äù Arian sect among other heresies. The Narrative history begins with a brief epitome of the Biblical Old Testament and New Testament, and the subsequent spread of the Christian Religion into Gaul. Next Gregory covers the history of Christianity in Gaul and some of the major events in Roman-Gallo relations. Book one ends with the death of Saint Martin of Tours in AD 397. Book 2- AD 397-511 Covers the beginnings of the Merovingian dynasty. Book two ends with the death of King Clovis in 511, after his conquest of large tracts of land in modern day france. also narrated is Clovis conversion to Christianity by his wife Clotilde. Book 3- AD 511-548 Follows the four male inheritors of King Clovis who equally divide his realms at his death i. AD 511. These four kings, Theodoric I, Lothar I, Childebert, and Chlodomer; quarrel and fight for supremacy of the Frankish realm. Despite their disputes, the four brothers can occasionally work together against a outside, such as successful cooperation against the Burgundians in 523. Eventually Clothar becomes the most powerful King in the Frankish realm. Book three ends with the death of king Theudebert I in 548. He is a grandson of Clovis and son to king Theodoric I, who died in 534 bequesting his kingdom to Theudebert. The kingdom after 548 falls to Theudobald I until 555. Book 4- AD 548-575 The two remaining Sons of Clovis die; King Childebert in 558 and King Clothar in 561. the last years of his life, see the entire realm of the Frank ruled by Clothar. At the time of his demise in AD 561(like Clovis before him), the Kingdom is divided equally between four sons of Clothar and again the Kingly sons quarrel for control of the entire Kingdom. A truce between the brothers is maintained until after the death of King Charibert I (son of Clothar) in 567. Clothars remaining sons Kings Sigibert, Guntram, and Chilperic; fight for the supremacy of the kingdom, with King Sigibert showing the strongest military force.Book four ends with the killing of King Sigbert in AD 575. Gregory of Tours blames Fredegund, the wife of King Chilperic for this assassination. The death leaves King Chilperic as the dominant king. Fredegund has long held a grudge against King Sigibert and his wife Brunhilda. Book 5- AD 575-581 This book begins the part of the narrative where the author (Bishop Gregory of Tours), has much personal knowledge about the events in the Frankish Kingdom. This book and the ones hereafter, are considerably longer and more detailed than previous, whilst covering a smaller amount of time. This book also contains Gregories impressions of ecclesiastical issues he saw in person and had some bearing on. This book describes a possible debate that Gregory had with a rival Arian church leader. Book 5 also introduces Childebert II, the son of recently slain King Sigibert, and of the still living Brunhilda. Childebert is taken along with Brunhilda under the protection of King Gunthram, brother and sometime rival of King Chilperic. Book 6-AD 581-584 The young Childebert betrays his alliance with his adoptive uncle King Gunthram. the king who had protected Childebert and his mother after his father Sigiberts death. Now Childebert forms an alliance with his uncle, King Chilperic, who had often been an enemy of King Sigibert. Later, King Chilperic is murdered under mysterious circumstances in AD 584. Book 7- AD 584 Fredegund assumes regency for her young son Clothar II. In the future Clothar will be king of all franks until his death in 619, but that is beyond gregories narrative which end in roughly AD 593. Fredegund and her son are under the protection of King Gunthram. She remains in power until her death in AD 597. Also in this book is the rebellion of Gundovald and its failure. Gundovald claimed to be a lost illegitimate son of dead King Chlothar I. Many of the Frankish nobles and the Byzantine emperors Maurice gave some support to this rebellion; however, it is swiftly crushed by King Guntram. Book 8- AD 585 Book 9- AD 586-587. The Treaty of Andelot is signed in AD 587 between King Guntram, Brunhilda, and King Childebert II. The treaty is a close pact of alliance, wherein Childebert is formally adopted as Guntram‚Äôs heir. Brunhilda also formally allies with Guntram and comes under his protection. Book 10- AD 587-591 Around 589, Basina the daughter of King Chilperic I and Clotilda, daughter of King Charibert lead a brief revolt from a nunnery. The 18 Bishops of Tours are named and described. Book ten ends with a summary of Gregorys previous written works. The Historia Francorum is made up of ten books. Books I to IV initially recount the world's history from the Creation (as was traditional);J Burrow, A History of Histories (London 2007) p. 198 but move quickly on to the Christianization of Gaul, the life and times of Saint Martin of Tours, the conversion of the Franks and the conquest of Gaul under Clovis,J M Wallace- Hadrill, The Barbarian West (London 1952) p. 71-2 and the more detailed history of the Frankish kings down to the death of Sigebert I in 575. At this date Gregory had been bishop of Tours for two years. With his fifth book, Gregory embarks (with some relief) on contemporary history, opening ‚ÄúHere, I am glad to say, begins Book V‚Äù.Quoted in J Burrow, A History of Histories (London 2007) p. 205 This, the second part of his history, books V and VI, closes with Chilperic I's death in 584. During the years that Chilperic held Tours, relations between him and Gregory were tense. After hearing rumours that the Bishop of Tours had slandered his wife, Fredegund, Chilperic had Gregory arrested and tried for treason‚Äîa charge which threatened both Gregory's bishopric and his life. The most eloquent passage in the Historia is the closing chapter of book VI, in which Chilperic's character is summed up unsympathetically through the use of an invective: Herod and Nero are among the comparisons employed.J B Bury ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol II (Cambridge 1926) p. 122 The third part, comprising books VII to X, takes his increasingly personal account to the year 591, and concludes with a plea for further chroniclers to preserve his work in entirety (as indeed would be done).J Burrow, A History of Histories (London 2007) p. 210 An epilogue was written in 594, the year of Gregory's death. Problems of interpretation Readers of the Historia Francorum must decide whether this is a royal history and whether Gregory was writing to please his patrons. It is likely that one royal Frankish house is more generously treated than others. Gregory was also a Catholic bishop, and his writing reveals views typical of someone in his position. His views on perceived dangers of Arianism, still strong among the Visigoths,J Burrow, A History of Histories (London 2007) p. 204 led him to preface the Historia with a detailed expression of his orthodoxy on the nature of Christ. In addition, his ridiculing of pagans and Jews reflected how his works were used to spread the Christian faith. For example, in book 2, chapters 28-31, he describes the pagans as incestuous and weak and then describes the process by which newly converted King Clovis leads a much better life than that of a pagan and is healed of all the conundrums he experienced as a pagan. Gregory's education was the standard Latin one of Late Antiquity, focusing on Virgil's Aeneid and Martianus Capella's Liber de Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae, but also other key texts such as Orosius' Chronicles, which his Historia continues, and Sallust; he refers to all these works in his own. His education, as was typical for the time, did not extend to a broad acquaintance with the pagan classics,J Burrow, A History of Histories (London 2007) p. 200 but rather progressed to mastery of the Vulgate Bible. It is said that he constantly complained about his use of grammar.Gregory of Tours, The History of the Franks. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974, p. 63. He did not understand how to correctly write masculine and feminine phrases, reflecting either a lack of ability or changes in the Latin language. Though he had read Virgil, considered the greatest Latin stylist, he cautions that \\"We ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death.\\" By contrast, he seems to have thoroughly studied the lengthy and complex Vulgate Bible, as well as numerous religious works and historical treatises, which he frequently quotes, particularly in the earlier books of the Historia. The main impression that historians once retained from the Historia focused on Gregory's anecdotes about violence;J Burrow, A History of Histories (London 2007) p. 203-4 until recently, historians tended to conclude that Merovingian Gaul was a chaotic, brutal mess. Recent scholarship has refuted that view. Through more careful readings, scholars have concluded that Gregory's underlying purpose was to highlight the vanity of secular life and contrast it with the miracles of the Saints.See especially Goffart (1988) and Mitchell and Wood (2002) Though Gregory conveys political and other messages through the Historia, and these are studied very closely, historians now generally agree that this contrast is the central and ever-present narrative device. St. Gregory and King Chilperic I, from the Grandes Chroniques de France de Charles V, 14th century illumination. =Hagiographies= His Life of the Fathers comprises twenty hagiographies of the most prominent men of the preceding generation, taking in a wide range the spiritual community of early medieval Gaul, including lives of bishops, clerics, monks, abbots, holy men and hermits. St. Illidius is praised for his purity of heart, St. Brachio the abbot for his discipline and determination in study of the scriptures, St Patroclus for his unwavering faith in the face of weakness, and St. Nicetius, bishop of Lyon, for his justice. It is the life of St. Nicetius of Trier, though, which dominates this book; his great authority and sense of episcopal responsibility which is the focus of Gregory's account as his figure, predestined to be great, bestrides the lives of the others. It is told that he felt a weight on his head, but he was unable to see what it was when turning around, though upon smelling its sweet scent he realised that it was the weight of episcopal responsibility. (Life of the Fathers, XVII, 1) He surmounts the others in the glory of his miracles, and was chosen by God to have the entire succession of past and future Frankish kings revealed to him. A further aspect of this work to note is the appearance of Gregory himself in certain sections, notably in the life of St. Leobardus. This is for two reasons: Firstly, it creates a distinct link between the temporal and the spiritual worlds, firmly placing the accounts of the lives in a world which is understandable and recognisable, or, seen from the other angle, confirming the presence of miracles in the temporal world. Secondly, the intercession of Gregory serves to set Leobardus straight, after he had been tempted by the devil (Life of the Fathers, XX, 3), and so this act further enhances the authority of bishops as a whole. In 587 Gregory began writing the Book of the Glories of the Martyrs (Liber in gloria martyrum), which deals ‚Äúalmost exclusively with the miracles wrought in Gaul by the martyrs of the Roman persecutions.‚ÄùCatholic Encyclopedia But it also tells the story of one Theodore who made a pilgrimage to India and reported the existence of a large monastery where the body of Thomas the Apostle was first interred and where miracles took place.Robert Silverberg, The Realm of Prester John, Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1972, page 27. =Fighting heresy= Gregory's avowed aim in writing this book was to \\"fire others with that enthusiasm by which the saints deservedly climbed to heaven\\", though this was not his sole purpose, and he most surely did not expect his entire audience to show promise of such piety as to witness the power of God flowing through them in the way that it did for the fathers. More immediate concerns were at the forefront of his mind as he sought to create a further layer of religious commitment, not only to the Church at Rome, but to local churches and cathedrals throughout Gaul. Along with his other books, notably the Glory of the Confessors, the Glory of the Martyrs and the Life of St. Martin, meticulous attention is paid to the local as opposed to the universal Christian experience. Within these grandiloquent lives are tales and anecdotes which tie miracles, saints and their relics to a great diversity of local areas, furnishing his audience with greater knowledge of their local shrine, and providing them with evidence of the work of God in their immediate vicinity, thus greatly expanding their connection with and understanding of their faith. Attacks on heresy also appear throughout his hagiographies, and Arianism is taken to be the common face of heresy across Europe, exposed to great ridicule. Often, the scenes which expose the weaknesses of heresy (Glory of the Martyrs, 79, 80) focus on images of fire and burning, whilst the Catholics are proved right by the protection lavished on them by God. This was of great relevance to Gregory himself as he presided over the important see of Tours, where extensive use was made of the cult of St. Martin in establishing the authority of the bishopric with the congregation and in the context of the Frankish church. Gregory's hagiography was an essential component of this. However, this should not be seen as a selfish grab for power on behalf of the bishops who emerge so triumphantly from the Life of the Fathers, but rather as a bid for hegemony of doctrine and control over the practice of worship, which they believed to be in the best interests of their congregation and the wider church. =Gregory's Creed= As an example of Gregory's zeal in his fight against heresy, the Historia Francorum includes a declaration of faith with which Gregory aimed to prove his orthodoxy with respect to the heresies of his time (\\"so that my reader may have no doubt that I am Catholic for they are.\\").Book I.i The confession is in many phrases, each of which refutes a specific Christian heresy. Thus Gregory's creed presents, in the negative, a virtual litany of heresies: Legacy The Historia Francorum is of salient historical interest, representing as it does the central narrative with respect to the Franks for the period of transition from Roman to Medieval, and the establishment of the large and important Frankish state.J. M. Wallace- Hadrill, The Barbarian West (London 1964) p. 91 With his lively style, story- telling ability, and skill in conveying human interest, Gregory has been compared to Herodotus;H.M. Gwatkin ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol II (Cambridge 1926) p. 157 with his detailed interest in, and accounts of, ecclesiastical history and manoeuvrings, to a bloodier Trollope.J. Burrow, A History of Histories (Penguin 2009) p. 208-9 Gregory's hagiographies are also an invaluable source of anecdotes and stories which enrich modern understanding of life and belief in Merovingian Gaul. The motivation behind his works was to show readers the importance and strength of Christianity. Alongside Venantius Fortunatus, he is the outstanding literary figure from the 6th century Merovingian world;H.M. Gwatkin ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol II (Cambridge 1926) p. 156 and his extensive literary output is itself a testimony to the preservation of learning and to the lingering continuity of Gallo-Roman civic culture through the early Middle Ages.

Players move their pieces around a board, the squares they land on determining the subject of a question they are asked from a card (from six categories including \\"history\\" and \\"science and nature\\"). Each correct answer earns a plastic wedge which is slotted into the answerer's playing piece. Since the game's first release in 1981, dozens of themed editions have been released. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as Star Wars, Saturday Night Live, and The Lord of the Rings movies). History The game was created on December 15, 1979 in Montreal by Canadian Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's The Gazette, and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for The Canadian Press. After finding pieces of their Scrabble game missing, they decided to create their own game. With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1981. The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (now part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million. , more than 100 millionhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/11293880/Trivial- Pursuit-10-facts-about-the-game.html games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the \\"Games Hall of Fame\\" by Games magazine. An online version of Trivial Pursuit was launched in September 2003. Gameplay A Trivial Pursuit playing piece, with all six wedges filled The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit, the Geography category is blue, Entertainment is pink, History is yellow, Arts & Literature is originally brown, later purple, Science & Nature is green, and Sports & Leisure is orange. The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die. Playing pieces used in Trivial Pursuit are round and divided into six sections like wedges of pie. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese (like cheese triangles), can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress. During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal \\"hub\\" space. At the end of each spoke is a \\"category headquarters\\" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to its color, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, his turn continues; a correct answer on a category headquarters space awards a wedge of that color if the player does not yet have one. Wedges are fitted into a player's piece as they are earned. Some spaces say \\"roll again,\\" giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a \\"wild\\" space; a player landing here may answer a question in any chosen category. Questions must be answered without any outside assistance. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board. Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his playing piece, he must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn. Editions Board and pieces of Trivial Pursuit. Trivial Pursuit Party is a simplified edition of Trivial Pursuit where every correct answer earns the player a wedge, thus making the game time shorter. Over the years, numerous editions of Trivial Pursuit have been produced, usually specializing in various fields. The original version is known as the Genus edition (or Genus I). Several different general knowledge editions (such as Genus II) have followed. Other editions include Junior Edition (1985), All-Star Sports, Baby Boomers, 1980s, All About the 80s, 1990s and others. In total, over 100 different editions in different languages have been printed. In the United Kingdom, Trivial Pursuit players complained that the 2006 version of the game was dumbed down in comparison to previous editions, with easier questions and more focus on celebrities and show business.  Reception  The board game has received mixed reviews throughout those years as Gamespot has described the game as \\"fun because the formula tickles the inner trivia nut in everyone\\", The Toy Insider mentioned that it can be \\"enjoyed by baby boomers, millennials, and everyone in between\\" and Board Games Land called it \\"The timeless classic and the godfather of trivia games\\". Legal action =Fred Worth lawsuit= In October 1984, Fred L. Worth, author of The Trivia Encyclopedia, Super Trivia, and Super Trivia II, filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of Trivial Pursuit. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even to the point of reproducing typographical errors and deliberately placed misinformation. One of the questions in Trivial Pursuit was \\"What was Columbo's first name?\\" with the answer \\"Philip\\". That information had been fabricated to catch anyone who might try to violate his copyright. The inventors of Trivial Pursuit acknowledged that Worth's books were among their sources, but argued that this was not improper and that facts are not protected by copyright. The district court judge agreed, ruling in favor of the Trivial Pursuit inventors. The decision was appealed, and in September 1987 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the ruling. Worth asked the Supreme Court of the United States to review the case, but the Court declined, denying certiorari in March 1988. (cert. denied.) =David Wall lawsuit= In 1994, David Wall of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, launched a lawsuit against the game's creators. He claimed that in the fall of 1979, he and a friend were hitchhiking near Sydney, Nova Scotia, when they were picked up by Chris Haney. Wall claimed that he told Haney about his idea for the game in detail, including the shape of the markers. Wall's mother testified she found drawings of his that looked like plans for a Trivial Pursuit-like game, but the drawings had since been destroyed. Wall's friend, who was allegedly hitchhiking with him that day, never testified. Haney said he never met Wall. Over the years, there was much legal wrangling, notably around whether the suit should be decided by a judge or jury. On June 25, 2007, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court ruled against Wall. Adaptations =Television= A version of Trivial Pursuit, hosted by Wink Martindale, aired on The Family Channel in the United States from 1993 to 1995 (Jay Wolpert had attempted a pilot in 1987, but it was not picked up). A syndicated version entitled Trivial Pursuit: America Plays aired from 2008 to 2009 and hosted by Christopher Knight. In September 2004, Roger Lodge hosted a sports trivia game show on ESPN entitled ESPN Trivial Pursuit, which aired five episodes. BBC Television produced a Trivial Pursuit game show based on the game in the UK hosted by Rory McGrath. Another British version (with rules/format similar to the Wink Martindale version, and also using the same theme tune as the Wink Martindale version) was hosted on The Family Channel (now Challenge) by Tony Slattery. Birgit Lechtermann hosted a version for VOX in Germany from 1993 to 1994. In 1988, a made-for-television movie entitled Breaking all the Rules: The Creation of Trivial Pursuit aired. Treated largely as a comedy, the movie featured the music of Jimmy Buffett and portrayed the creators of the game as three beer-loving Canadians. In Spain, a version of the show called Trivial Pursuit: Spain Plays premiered in September 2008 on Antena 3. The Soviet Union in 1989 bought the rights to produce its own version of the board game, and also started an official championship for family teams, finals of which were broadcast on Soviet Central Television as the game show ¬´Lucky case¬ª (russian: –°—á–∞—Å—Ç–ª–∏–≤—ã–π —Å–ª—É—á–∞–π). After the agreement ended in 1991, the show changed their rules, dropping ¬´Trivial Pursuit¬ª elements, and continued broadcasting until 2000. =Arcade game= In 1984, Bally Sente released a Trivial Pursuit arcade game. Like the board game, several variants were also released. =Home computer games= British software company Domark released a home computer version (billed as Trivial Pursuit: The Computer Game) for multiple formats during the 1980s. This version included pictorial and musical questions but was otherwise mostly faithful to the mechanics of the original board game. Later, Domark released another version called Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning, also across multiple formats. This version featured a plot about the dying Earth and significantly altered gameplay mechanics. Hasbro Interactive released a \\"Millennium Edition\\" in 1999 with three different modes, and different categories: *Classic Pursuit: Played just like the board game. A \\"QUICKPLAY\\" option was also available, where, to speed the game up, every question would be a wedge question. Up to six can play. The winner is the first one to earn all six wedges, land back in the center hub by exact count, and then give a correct answer. *Party Pursuit: Up to three can play. The computer randomly spins categories until there are three to choose from. A correct answer by the first player to buzz in earns the wedge; a wrong answer gives the opposition a chance, as well as take away any wedges earned in a category. The first player to earn all six wedges wins the game. After 20 questions, the computer begins selecting categories for the players. *Point Pursuit: Same as Party Pursuit, except point scores are kept, and questions range from 250 to 1,000 points. Players can also wager any or all of their scores on one final question. Bonus points are earned for a wedge and for how much or how little time it took to answer a question. There are also three different ways to answer the questions: *Multiple choice, where players choose from numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4; *Spelling accuracy: loose, where imperfect spelling is accepted by the program; *Spelling accuracy: strict, where spelling must be precise. This game featured a total of seven voice-overs, one host, and one for each of the six categories: People & Places (blue wedge), Arts & Entertainment (pink wedge), History (yellow wedge), Science & Nature (brown wedge), Sports & Leisure (green wedge), and Wild Card (orange wedge). =Online games= In 1999, Sony Online Entertainment licensed Trivial Pursuit from Hasbro Interactive to release a downloadable online game on The Station@Sony (home to Everquest at the time), where up to three auto-matched players could chat with each other live while they played. A correct answer on any space earned a wedge on the category answered, the wedge spaces gave the player their choice of category, and the first person to earn four wedges was the winner. It was hosted on The Station until 2001. In 2003, Bolenka Games released an online game of Trivial Pursuit on the now-defunct website Uproar.comTrivial Pursuit on Uproarwhere it features five editions such as: Genius, Silver Screen, Music, 1980s and TV. =Video games= Trivial Pursuit was released for a number of home video systems, including Sega CD, Wii, Nintendo Switch, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4.Trivial Pursuit Live! on PlayStation 4, ign.com The board game was also adapted into a mobile game called Trivia Crack.

The competitors in a race try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal. A race may be run continuously to finish or may be made of several segments called heats, stages or legs. A heat is usually run over the same course at different times. A stage is a shorter section of a much longer course or a time trial. Early records of races are evident on pottery from ancient Greece, which depicted running men vying for first place. A chariot race is described in Homer's Iliad. Etymology The word race comes from a Norse word. This Norse word arrived in France during the invading of Normandy and gave the word raz which means \\"swift water\\" in Brittany, as in a mill race; it can be found in \\"Pointe du Raz\\" (the most western point of France, in Brittany), and \\"raz-de-mar√©e\\" (tsunami). The word race to mean a \\"contest of speed\\" was first recorded in the 1510s. A race and its name are often associated with the place of origin, the means of transport and the distance of the race. As a couple of examples, see the Dakar Rally or the Athens Marathon. Forms Russian women's team pose after winning 4 √ó 400 m relay race at 2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships. Running a distance is the most basic form of racing, but races may be conducted in vehicles, such as boats, cars, motorcycles, bicycles and aircraft; or with animals such as horses or dogs. Races may also be conducted with other modes of transport such as skis, sleds, skates or wheelchair; or other forms of movement such as swimming or walking. In a relay race members of a team take turns in racing parts of a circuit or performing a certain racing form. Orienteering races add an additional task of using a map and compass to navigate from point to point in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain. A race can also involve any other type of goal like eating. A common race involving eating is a hot dog eating race, where contestants try to eat more hot dogs than the other racers. Racing board games and racing video games are also competitions of speed. Racing can also be done in more humoristic and entertaining ways such as the Sausage Race, the Red Bull Trolley Grand Prix and wok racing. Racing can be entertained from around the world.  Sprint finishes  A sprint finish is a racing tactic used in many forms of racing where a competitor accelerates towards top speed in the final stages of a race. This tactic is mostly associated with long-distance forms of running and cycling, which often feature large groups of competitors racing at a slower pace for much of the race ‚Äì this slower aerobic racing allows for the subsequent anaerobic activity required for sprinting.Ronald J Maughan, & Michael Gleeson (20 May 2010). \\"Energy Supply\\". The Biochemical Basis of Sports Performance (pg. 129). Oxford University Press. The tactic relies upon keeping greater energy reserves than your opponent until the last part of the race in order to be able to reach the finish point first. It is the opposing tactic to keeping a steady optimal pace throughout a race to maximise your energy efficiency (see running economy).Stevenson, Roy. Developing a fast finish for your road races. Multi Briefs. Retrieved on 2014-04-17. In track and field, distances from 1500 metres upwards often feature sprint finishes. They can also be found in cross country and road running events, even up to the marathon distance. A runner's ability to sprint at the end of a race is also known as their finishing kick.Fitzgerald, Matt (2013-11-18). Kick Your Way To Better Race Times. Competitor. Retrieved on 2014-04-17. Multisport races, such as the triathlon, often have running as the final section and sprint finish tactics are applied as they are in running-only events.Stevenson, Roy (2013-07-13). Developing a fast finish. Triathlon & Multisport Magazine. Retrieved on 2014-04-17. In cycling, sprint finishes are an integral part of the sport and are used in both track cycling and road cycling. Cycling sprints are often highly tactical, particularly on the track, with cyclists occasionally coming to a near halt at points before reaching a high speed finish.The individual sprint . BBC Sport. Retrieved on 2014-04-17. The longer track races such as scratch races often feature sprint finishes, as maintaining a steady pace within the peloton allows opponents to conserve energy through drafting.Scratch Race. Cycling Calendar. Retrieved on 2014-04-17. Road races are similar in this respect, in both short criterium races and long-distance races. Sprint tactics also form a major part of points classifications in road events, where cycling sprinters specialise in reaching an intermediate point first, thus gaining extra points and resulting prizes.Gitz, Jarred (2014-04-05).

As compared to dot matrix printers that print a single column of dots at a time, this printer generally creates an entire line of dots at a time. Therefore, it is also known as a line matrix printer. This technology produces premium impact printers that print for millions to billions of dots per hammer. The advantage of this technology is that it has the lowest known cost of ownership: ink is transferred by conventional typewriter-style ribbons.  Technology and use  The most common printer to use this technology was the line-matrix printer made by Printronix and its licensees. In this type, the hammers are arranged as a \\"hammerbank\\"; a type of comb that oscillate horizontally to produce a line of dots. A character matrix printer has also been produced. In this printer, the hammers are machined from an oval of magnetically permeable stainless steel, and the hammer-tips form vertical rows. The original technology, patented by Printronix in 1974, has the top of a stiff leaf spring held back by a magnetic pole-piece. A tungsten carbide hammer is brazed to the center-top of the leaf spring. When it produces a dot, a coil (electromagnet) wrapped around the pole-piece neutralizes the magnetic field. The leaf spring snaps the hammer away from the pole-piece, pushing the hammer out against a ribbon and placing an image of a dot onto the paper. Recent designs have performed complex optimizations in the magnetic circuit, and eliminated unwanted resonances in the spring. The result was a near- doubling of speed. Other improvements include the use of electrical discharge machining to produce complex, three-dimensional hammers that trade-off the magnetic circuit, mechanical resonances, and printing speed. Normal wear usually occurs when the spring rubs against the pole-piece as it returns. This causes the pole-piece to wear, eventually requiring the pole pieces to be reground and recertified. Hexavalent chrome plating on the pole-piece, combined with careful design, more than doubles speeds and improves life-span. It produces approximately a billion impressions per hammer.

It derives from integumentum, which is Latin for \\"a covering\\". In a transferred or figurative sense, it could mean a cloak or a disguise. In English \\"integument\\" is a fairly modern word, its origin having been traced back to the early seventeenth century. It can mean a material or layer with which anything is enclosed, clothed, or covered in the sense of \\"clad\\" or \\"coated\\", as with a skin or husk.  Botanical usage  In botany the senses are similar to those in zoology, referring to the covering of an organ. When the context indicates nothing to the contrary, the word commonly refers to an envelope covering the ovule. The integument may consist of one layer (unitegmic) or two layers (bitegmic), each of which consisting of two or more layers of cells. The integument is perforated by a pore, the micropyle, through which the pollen tube can enter. It may develop into the testa, or seed coat. Zoological usage The integument of an organ in zoology typically would comprise membranes of connective tissue such as those around a kidney or liver. In referring to the integument of an animal, the usual sense is its skin and its derivatives: the integumentary system, where \\"integumentary\\" is a synonym for \\"cutaneous\\". In arthropods, the integument, or external \\"skin\\", consists of a single layer of epithelial ectoderm from which arises the cuticle, an outer covering of chitin the rigidity of which varies as per its chemical composition. Derivative terms and sundry usages Derivative terms include various adjectival forms such as integumentary (e.g. system), integumental (e.g. integumental glands, \\"peltate glands, the integument being raised like a bladder due to abundant secretion\\"Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth & Co.

Routers are mainly used in woodworking, especially cabinetry. Usually they're handheld or fastened, with the cutting end up, in router tables. The hand tool type of router is the original form. It is a specialized hand plane with a broad base and a narrow blade that projects well beyond its base plate (giving it the nickname old woman's tooth). The power tool form of router, with a spindle driven by an electric motor, is now the more common form. The hand tool version is now often called a router plane; for some tasks, it still has a few advantages over the power tool. Some workers consider the electric router one of the most versatile woodworking power tools.Broun 1989 CNC wood routers implement the advantages of Computer Numerical Control (CNC). Related to the router is a smaller, lighter version, designed specifically for trimming laminates. It can be used for smaller general routing work. For example, with an appropriate jig it can be used for recessing door hinges and recessing lock faceplates. Even rotary tools can be used as routers when the right bits and accessories (such as plastic router bases) are attached. History Before power routers existed, the hand tool form was frequently used, especially by patternmakers and staircase makers. The first handheld power routers were invented in 1915 and were Jet Motor Hand Routers, called Onsruters. The name derives from a combination of the inventor's last name \\"Onsrud\\" and the term \\"router\\". The Onsruter combined a router plane with an endmill to create the first handheld power router. The idea for the Onsruter started when a rail road company decided they wanted to power the front light on a steam locomotive using steam from the engine. Oscar Onsrud and his son Rudy submitted a design for an air turbine to generate the power for the light, however they didn't win the contract. A few months later Rudy Onsrud told a friend about his frustrations making the groove in the bottom of a cane bottom chair using a router plane. He suddenly realized that he could re-purpose the air turbine to run on compressed air and spin a modified endmill to rout the groove. Modified endmills would have to spin at 30,000 RPM, instead of the 3,000 RPM of a milling machine to cut wood without burning it. The bits also needed a steeper rake and clearance angle than a traditional endmill so they could evacuate the chips. These new bits became known as router bits or router cutters (UK). Further refinement produced the plunge router, invented by ELU (now part of DeWalt) in Germany around 1949. This is even better adapted for many types of work. Starting in the 1960s, the power tool form of router became the more common form. Modern routers are often used in place of traditional moulding planes or spindle moulder machines for edge decoration (moulding) of timber.  Process  Routing is a high speed process of cutting, trimming, and shaping wood, metal, plastic, and a variety of other materials. = Chip formation = Modern plunge router showing dust extraction tube Routing and milling are conceptually similar, and end mills can be used in routers, but routing wood is different from milling metal in terms of the mechanics. Chip formation is different, so the optimal tool geometry is different. Routing is properly applied to relatively weak and brittle materials, typically wood. As these materials are weak in small sections, routers can run at extremely high speeds, so even a small router may cut rapidly. Owing to inertia at these high speeds, the normal wood cutting mechanism of Type I chips cannot take place. The cutter edge angle is blunt, approaching 90¬∞, and so a Type III chip forms, with waste material produced as fine dust. This dust is a respiratory hazard, even in benign materials. The forces against the cutter are light, so routers may be hand-held. When milling metals, the material is relatively ductile, although remaining strong even at a small scale. A Type II chip forms, and waste may be produced as continuous swarf. Cutter forces are high, so milling machines must be robust and rigid, usually substantial constructions of cast iron. Intermediate materials, such as plastics and sometimes soft aluminium, may be cut by either method, though routing aluminium is usually more of an improvised expedient than a production process, and is noisy and hard on tools. = Process characteristics = Makita laminate trimmer Routing is usually limited to soft metals (aluminium etc.) and rigid non-metals. Specially designed cutters are used for a variety of patterns, cuts, and edging. Both hand controlled and machine controlled/aided routers are common today. = Workpiece geometry = Routing is a shaping process that produces finished edges and shapes. Some materials that are difficult to shape with other processes, such as fiber-glass, Kevlar, and graphite, can be shaped and finished neatly via various routing techniques. Apart from finished edges and shaping, cutaways, holes, and contours can also be shaped using routers.  Tools and equipment  * The set up includes an air or electric driven router, a cutting tool often referred to as a router bit, and a guide template. Also the router can be fixed to a table or connected to radial arms which can be controlled more easily. * In general there are three types of cutting bits or tools. *# Fluted cutters (used for edging and trimming) *# Profile cutters (used for shaping and trimming) *# Helical cutters (used on easily machined materials, for drilling, shaping, trimming) * Safety glasses and ear protection should be worn at all times when using a router. * Only trained adults, or trained adolescents with supervision, should use the router.  Moulding  The spindle router is positioned at the finer end of the scale of work done by a moulding spindle. That is to say it is able to cut grooves, edge moulding, and chamfer or radius the edge of a piece of wood. It is also possible to use it for cutting some joints. The shape of cut that is created is determined by the size and shape of the bit (cutter) held in the collet and the depth by the depth adjustment of the sole plate.  Variety of routers  There are a variety of router styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different manufacturers produce the routers for different wood works, as plunge routers, fixed-base wood routers, combo routers, variable-speed routers, laminate trimmers, CNC wood routers. Nowadays, most better quality routers have variable speed controls and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the router can be used as a fixed-base router. Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for routers with a large cutter. Holding a 3-horsepower router and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the motor. Holding it with two hands is a must. For routers with a toggle type on/off switch it is important to check to verify the switch is in the off position, prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger router cutters can usually only be used in a router that is mounted in a router table. This makes the tool even more versatile and stable. The purpose of multiple handle arrangements depends on the bit. Control is easier with different configurations. For example, when shaping the edge of a fine table top, many users prefer a D handle, with variable speed, as it seems to permit better control and burning the wood can be minimized. Routers have many uses. With the help of the multitude of jigs and various bits, they are capable of producing dovetails, mortises, and tenons, moldings of infinite varieties, dados, rabbets/rebates, raised-panel doors and frames, cutting circles, and so much more.  Features of the modern spindle router  template guide bushing secured in the base around the router cutter The tool usually consists of a base housing a vertically mounted universal electric motor with a collet on the end of its shaft. The bit is height-adjustable to allow protrusion through an opening in a flat sole plate, usually via adjusting the motor-mounting height (the mechanism of adjustment is widely varied among manufacturers). Control of the router is derived from a handle or knob on each side of the device, or by the more recently developed \\"D-handle\\". There are two standard types of router‚Äîplunge and fixed. When using a plunge-base router, the sole of the base is placed on the face of the work with the cutting bit raised above the work, then the motor is turned on and the cutter is lowered into the work. With a fixed-base router, the cut depth is set before the tool is turned on. The sole plate is then either rested flat on the workpiece overhanging the edge so that the cutting bit is not contacting the work (and then entering the work from the side once the motor is turned on), or the sole plate is placed at an angle with the bit above the work and the bit is \\"rocked\\" over into the work once the motor is turned on. In each case, the bit cuts its way in, but the plunge router does it in a more refined way, although the bit used must be shaped so it bores into the wood when lowered. The baseplate (sole plate) is generally circular (though this, too, varies by individual models) and may be used in conjunction with a fence attached to the base, which then braces the router against the edge of the work, or via a straight-edge clamped across the work to obtain a straight cut. Other means of guiding the machine include the template guide bushing secured in the base around the router cutter, or router cutters with built-in guide bearings. Both of these run against a straight edge or shaped template. Without this, the varying reaction of the wood against the torque of the tool makes it impossible to control with the precision normally required.  Table mounted router  View underneath a router table showing plunge router attached. A router may be mounted upside down in a router table or bench. The router's base plate is mounted to the underside of the table, with a hole allowing the bit to protrude above the table top. This allows the work to be passed over the router, rather than passing the router over the work. This has benefits when working with smaller objects and makes some router operations safer to execute. A router table may be fitted with a fence, fingerboards and other work-guiding accessories to make the operation safer and more accurate. A simple router table consists of a rigid top with the router bolted or screwed directly to the underside. More complex solutions can be developed to allow the router to be easily removed from the table as well as facilitate adjusting the router's bit height using a lift mechanism; there is a wide range of commercially available systems. In this mode, the router can perform tasks similar to a spindle moulder. For smaller, lighter jobs, the router used in this way can be more convenient than the spindle moulder, with the task of set up being somewhat faster. There is also a much wider range of bit profiles available for the router, although the size is limited. The router table is usually oriented so that the router bit is vertical and the table over which the work is passed is horizontal. Variations on this include the horizontal router table, in which the table remains horizontal but the router is mounted vertically above the table, so that the router bit cuts from the side. This alternative is for edge operations, such as panel raising and slot cutting.  Available cutters  Profiles made in wood by several common router bits. Two typical router bits: (top) a ¬º-inch shaft Roman Ogee with bearing, (bottom) 1/4-inch shaft dovetail bit. Router bits come in sixteen thousand of varieties model to create either decorative effects or joinery aids. Generally, they are classified as either high-speed steel (HSS) or carbide-tipped, however some recent innovations such as solid carbide bits provide even more variety for specialized tasks. Aside from the materials they are made of, bits can be classified as edge bits or non-edge bits, and whether the bit is designed to be anti-kickback. Edge bits have a small wheel bearing to act as a fence against the work in making edge moldings. These bearings can be changed by using commercially available bearing kits. Changing the bearing, in effect, changes the diameter of the cutting edge. This is especially important with rabbeting/rebating bits. Non- edge bits require the use of a fence, either on a router table or attached to the work or router. Anti-kickback bits employ added non-cutting bit material around the circumference of the bit's shoulders which serves to limit feed- rate. This reduces the chance that the workpiece is pushed too deeply into the bit (which would result in significant kickback from the cutting edge being unable to compensate). Bits also differ by the diameter of their shank, with ¬Ω inch, 12mm, 10mm, ‚Öú inch, 8mm and ¬º inch and 6mm shanks (ordered from thickest to thinnest) being the most common. Half-inch bits cost more but, being stiffer, are less prone to vibration (giving smoother cuts) and are less likely to break than the smaller sizes. Care must be taken to ensure the bit shank and router collet sizes match exactly. Failure to do so can cause permanent damage to either or both and can lead to the dangerous situation of the bit coming out of the collet during operation. Many routers come with removable collets for the popular shank sizes (in the USA ¬Ω-in and ¬º-in, in Great Britain ¬Ω-in, 8mm and ¬º-in, and metric sizes in Europe‚Äîalthough in the United States the ‚Öú-in and 8mm sizes are often only available for an extra cost). Many modern routers allow the speed of the bit's rotation to be varied. A slower rotation allows bits of larger cutting diameter to be used safely. Typical speeds range from 8,000 to 30,000 rpm. Router bits can be made to match almost any imaginable profile. Custom router bits can be ordered. They are especially beneficial for home restoration projects, where production of the original trim and molding has been discontinued. Sometimes complementary bits come in sets designed to facilitate the joinery used in frame and panel construction. One bit is designed to cut the grove in the rail and stile pieces while the other shapes the edge of the panel to fit in the grove. Famous brand: Industrial grade: CMT, Freud Mid Carpenter grade: Bosch, Kowood Pro, Whiteside DIY grade: Kowood, Skil, Yonico  CNC router  A CNC wood router is a computer controlled machine to which the router or spindle mounts. The CNC Machine can be either a moving gantry style, where the table is fixed and the router spindle moves over it, or fixed bridge design, where the table moves underneath the router spindle, or hand-held style, where the operator moves the machine to the area to be cut and the machine controls the fine adjustments. CAD/CAM software programming is used to model the part that is to be created in the computer and then create a tool path for the machine to follow to cut out the part. The CNC moves along three axes (X-Y-Z). Most CNC routers have a three motor drive system utilizing either servo or stepper motors. More advanced routers use a four motor system for added speed and accuracy.  Similar tools  A tool similar to a router, but designed to hold smaller cutting bits‚Äîthereby making it easier to handle for small jobs‚Äîis a laminate trimmer. A related tool, called a spindle moulder (UK) or shaper (North America), is used to hold larger cutter heads and can be used for deeper or larger-diameter cuts. Another related machine is the pin router, a larger static version of the hand electric router but normally with a much more powerful motor and other features such as automatic template copying. Some profile cutters use a cutting head reminiscent of a spindle router. These should not be confused with profile cutters used for steel plate which use a flame as the cutting method.

They are considered the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates and a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty. They are among the characteristics that distinguish the extant birds from other living groups. Although feathers cover most of the bird's bodies, they arise only from certain well-defined tracts on the skin. They aid in flight, thermal insulation, and waterproofing. In addition, coloration helps in communication and protection. Plumology (or plumage science) is the name for the science that is associated with the study of feathers. Structures and characteristics Parts of a feather: Feather structure of a blue-and-yellow macaw Anterior region of a contour feather from a rock pigeon, visualized using scanning electron microscopy. Interlocking barbules are clearly seen in the middle image. Feathers are among the most complex integumentary appendages found in vertebrates and are formed in tiny follicles in the epidermis, or outer skin layer, that produce keratin proteins. The Œ≤-keratins in feathers, beaks and claws ‚Äî and the claws, scales and shells of reptiles ‚Äî are composed of protein strands hydrogen-bonded into Œ≤-pleated sheets, which are then further twisted and crosslinked by disulfide bridges into structures even tougher than the Œ±-keratins of mammalian hair, horns and hooves. The exact signals that induce the growth of feathers on the skin are not known, but it has been found that the transcription factor cDermo-1 induces the growth of feathers on skin and scales on the leg. Feather microstructure showing interlocking barbules =Classification= There are two basic types of feather: vaned feathers which cover the exterior of the body, and down feathers which are underneath the vaned feathers. The pennaceous feathers are vaned feathers. Also called contour feathers, pennaceous feathers arise from tracts and cover the entire body. A third rarer type of feather, the filoplume, is hairlike and (if present in a bird; they are entirely absent in ratites) are closely associated with pennaceous feathers and are often entirely hidden by them, with one or two filoplumes attached and sprouting from near the same point of the skin as each pennaceous feather, at least on a bird's head, neck and trunk. In some passerines, filoplumes arise exposed beyond the pennaceous feathers on the neck. The remiges, or flight feathers of the wing, and rectrices, or flight feathers of the tail, are the most important feathers for flight. A typical vaned feather features a main shaft, called the rachis. Fused to the rachis are a series of branches, or barbs; the barbs themselves are also branched and form the barbules. These barbules have minute hooks called barbicels for cross- attachment. Down feathers are fluffy because they lack barbicels, so the barbules float free of each other, allowing the down to trap air and provide excellent thermal insulation. At the base of the feather, the rachis expands to form the hollow tubular calamus (or quill) which inserts into a follicle in the skin. The basal part of the calamus is without vanes. This part is embedded within the skin follicle and has an opening at the base (proximal umbilicus) and a small opening on the side (distal umbilicus). Hatchling birds of some species have a special kind of natal down feathers (neossoptiles) which are pushed out when the normal feathers (teleoptiles) emerge. Flight feathers are stiffened so as to work against the air in the downstroke but yield in other directions. It has been observed that the orientation pattern of Œ≤-keratin fibers in the feathers of flying birds differs from that in flightless birds: the fibers are better aligned along the shaft axis direction towards the tip, and the lateral walls of rachis region show structure of crossed fibers. =Functions= Feathers insulate birds from water and cold temperatures. They may also be plucked to line the nest and provide insulation to the eggs and young. The individual feathers in the wings and tail play important roles in controlling flight. Some species have a crest of feathers on their heads. Although feathers are light, a bird's plumage weighs two or three times more than its skeleton, since many bones are hollow and contain air sacs. Color patterns serve as camouflage against predators for birds in their habitats, and serve as camouflage for predators looking for a meal. As with fish, the top and bottom colors may be different, in order to provide camouflage during flight. Striking differences in feather patterns and colors are part of the sexual dimorphism of many bird species and are particularly important in selection of mating pairs. In some cases there are differences in the UV reflectivity of feathers across sexes even though no differences in color are noted in the visible range. The wing feathers of male club-winged manakins Machaeropterus deliciosus have special structures that are used to produce sounds by stridulation. A contour feather from a Guinea fowl Some birds have a supply of powder down feathers which grow continuously, with small particles regularly breaking off from the ends of the barbules. These particles produce a powder that sifts through the feathers on the bird's body and acts as a waterproofing agent and a feather conditioner. Powder down has evolved independently in several taxa and can be found in down as well as in pennaceous feathers. They may be scattered in plumage as in the pigeons and parrots or in localized patches on the breast, belly, or flanks, as in herons and frogmouths. Herons use their bill to break the powder down feathers and to spread them, while cockatoos may use their head as a powder puff to apply the powder. Waterproofing can be lost by exposure to emulsifying agents due to human pollution. Feathers can then become waterlogged, causing the bird to sink. It is also very difficult to clean and rescue birds whose feathers have been fouled by oil spills. The feathers of cormorants soak up water and help to reduce buoyancy, thereby allowing the birds to swim submerged. Rictal bristles of a white-cheeked barbet Bristles are stiff, tapering feathers with a large rachis but few barbs. Rictal bristles are found around the eyes and bill. They may serve a similar purpose to eyelashes and vibrissae in mammals. Although there is as yet no clear evidence, it has been suggested that rictal bristles have sensory functions and may help insectivorous birds to capture prey. In one study, willow flycatchers (Empidonax traillii) were found to catch insects equally well before and after removal of the rictal bristles. Grebes are peculiar in their habit of ingesting their own feathers and feeding them to their young. Observations on their diet of fish and the frequency of feather eating suggest that ingesting feathers, particularly down from their flanks, aids in forming easily ejectable pellets. =Distribution= Feather tracts or pterylae and their naming Contour feathers are not uniformly distributed on the skin of the bird except in some groups such as the penguins, ratites and screamers. In most birds the feathers grow from specific tracts of skin called pterylae; between the pterylae there are regions which are free of feathers called apterylae (or apteria). Filoplumes and down may arise from the apterylae. The arrangement of these feather tracts, pterylosis or pterylography, varies across bird families and has been used in the past as a means for determining the evolutionary relationships of bird families. Species that incubate their own eggs often lose their feathers on a region of their belly, forming a brooding patch. =Coloration= Colors resulting from different feather pigments Left: turacin (red) and turacoverdin (green, with some structural blue iridescence at lower end) on the wing of Tauraco bannermani Right: carotenoids (red) and melanins (dark) on belly/wings of Ramphocelus bresilius The colors of feathers are produced by pigments, by microscopic structures that can refract, reflect, or scatter selected wavelengths of light, or by a combination of both. Most feather pigments are melanins (brown and beige pheomelanins, black and grey eumelanins) and carotenoids (red, yellow, orange); other pigments occur only in certain taxa ‚Äì the yellow to red psittacofulvins (found in some parrots) and the red turacin and green turacoverdin (porphyrin pigments found only in turacos). Structural coloration is involved in the production of blue colors, iridescence, most ultraviolet reflectance and in the enhancement of pigmentary colors. Structural iridescence has been reported in fossil feathers dating back 40 million years. White feathers lack pigment and scatter light diffusely; albinism in birds is caused by defective pigment production, though structural coloration will not be affected (as can be seen, for example, in blue-and-white budgerigars). A feather with no pigment The blues and bright greens of many parrots are produced by constructive interference of light reflecting from different layers of structures in feathers. In the case of green plumage, in addition to yellow, the specific feather structure involved is called by some the Dyck texture. Melanin is often involved in the absorption of light; in combination with a yellow pigment, it produces a dull olive-green. In some birds, feather colors may be created, or altered, by secretions from the uropygial gland, also called the preen gland. The yellow bill colors of many hornbills are produced by such secretions. It has been suggested that there are other color differences that may be visible only in the ultraviolet region, but studies have failed to find evidence. The oil secretion from the uropygial gland may also have an inhibitory effect on feather bacteria. The reds, orange and yellow colors of many feathers are caused by various carotenoids. Carotenoid- based pigments might be honest signals of fitness because they are derived from special diets and hence might be difficult to obtain, and/or because carotenoids are required for immune function and hence sexual displays come at the expense of health. A bird's feathers undergo wear and tear and are replaced periodically during the bird's life through molting. New feathers, known when developing as blood, or pin feathers, depending on the stage of growth, are formed through the same follicles from which the old ones were fledged. The presence of melanin in feathers increases their resistance to abrasion. One study notes that melanin based feathers were observed to degrade more quickly under bacterial action, even compared to unpigmented feathers from the same species, than those unpigmented or with carotenoid pigments. However, another study the same year compared the action of bacteria on pigmentations of two song sparrow species and observed that the darker pigmented feathers were more resistant; the authors cited other research also published in 2004 that stated increased melanin provided greater resistance. They observed that the greater resistance of the darker birds confirmed Gloger's rule. Although sexual selection plays a major role in the development of feathers, in particular the color of the feathers it is not the only conclusion available. New studies are suggesting that the unique feathers of birds is also a large influence on many important aspects of avian behavior, such as the height at which a different species build their nests. Since females are the prime care givers, evolution has helped select females to display duller colored down so that they may blend into the nesting environment. The position of the nest and whether it has a greater chance of being under predation has exerted constraints on female birds' plumage. A species of bird that nests on the ground, rather than the canopy of the trees, will need to have much duller colors in order not to attract attention to the nest. Since the female is the main care giver in some species of birds, evolution has helped select traits that make her feathers dull and often allow her to blend into the surroundings. The height study found that birds that nest in the canopies of trees often have many more predator attacks due to the brighter color of feathers that the female displays. Another influence of evolution that could play a part in why feathers of birds are so colorful and display so many patterns could be due to that birds developed their bright colors from the vegetation and flowers that thrive around them. Birds develop their bright colors from living around certain colors. Most bird species often blend into their environment, due to some degree of camouflage, so if the species habitat is full of colors and patterns, the species would eventually evolve to blend in to avoid being eaten. Birds' feathers show a large range of colors, even exceeding the variety of many plants, leaf and flower colors. Parasites The feather surface is the home for some ectoparasites, notably feather lice (Phthiraptera) and feather mites. Feather lice typically live on a single host and can move only from parents to chicks, between mating birds, and, occasionally, by phoresy. This life history has resulted in most of the parasite species being specific to the host and coevolving with the host, making them of interest in phylogenetic studies. Feather holes are chewing traces of lice (most probably Brueelia spp. lice) on the wing and tail feathers. They were described on barn swallows, and because of easy countability, many evolutionary, ecological, and behavioral publications use them to quantify the intensity of infestation. Parasitic cuckoos which grow up in the nests of other species also have host-specific feather lice and these seem to be transmitted only after the young cuckoos leave the host nest. Birds maintain their feather condition by preening and bathing in water or dust. It has been suggested that a peculiar behavior of birds, anting, in which ants are introduced into the plumage, helps to reduce parasites, but no supporting evidence has been found. Human usage Feathers have a number of utilitarian, cultural and religious uses. =Utilitarian functions= Pomo fully feathered basket curated at the Jesse Peter Multicultural Museum, Santa Rosa College Female model with feathers Feathers are both soft and excellent at trapping heat; thus, they are sometimes used in high-class bedding, especially pillows, blankets, and mattresses. They are also used as filling for winter clothing and outdoor bedding, such as quilted coats and sleeping bags. Goose and eider down have great loft, the ability to expand from a compressed, stored state to trap large amounts of compartmentalized, insulating air. Bird feathers have long been used for fletching arrows. Colorful feathers such as those belonging to pheasants have been used to decorate fishing lures. Feathers of large birds (most often geese) have been and are used to make quill pens. The word pen itself is derived from the Latin penna, meaning feather. The French word plume can mean either feather or pen. Feathers are also valuable in aiding the identification of species in forensic studies, particularly in bird strikes to aircraft. The ratios of hydrogen isotopes in feathers help in determining the geographic origins of birds. Feathers may also be useful in the non-destructive sampling of pollutants. The poultry industry produces a large amount of feathers as waste, which, like other forms of keratin, are slow to decompose. Feather waste has been used in a number of industrial applications as a medium for culturing microbes, biodegradeable polymers, and production of enzymes. Feather proteins have been tried as an adhesive for wood board. Some groups of Native people in Alaska have used ptarmigan feathers as temper (non-plastic additives) in pottery manufacture since the first millennium BC in order to promote thermal shock resistance and strength.Neusius, Sarah W. and G. Timothy Gross 2007 Seeking Our Past: An Introduction to North American Archaeology. Oxford University Press, NY. Historically, the hunting of birds for decorative and ornamental feathers (including in Victorian fashion) has endangered some species and helped to contribute to the extinction of others. For instance, South American hummingbird feathers were used in the past to dress some of the miniature birds featured in singing bird boxes. =In religion and culture= Mexican featherwork painting of Isidore the Laborer made from duck, hummingbird and canary feathers. This style of painting, popular during the Novohispanic era, integrates featherwork of pre-Hispanic origin with Christian iconography. 18th century, Museo Soumaya Eagle feathers have great cultural and spiritual value to American Indians in the US and First Nations peoples in Canada as religious objects. In the United States the religious use of eagle and hawk feathers is governed by the eagle feather law, a federal law limiting the possession of eagle feathers to certified and enrolled members of federally recognized Native American tribes. In South America, brews made from the feathers of condors are used in traditional medications. In India, feathers of the Indian peacock have been used in traditional medicine for snakebite, infertility, and coughs. During the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, there was a booming international trade in plumes for extravagant women's hats and other headgear. Frank Chapman noted in 1886 that feathers of as many as 40 species of birds were used in about three-fourths of the 700 ladies' hats that he observed in New York City.Doughty, Robin W. Feather Fashions and Bird Preservation, A Study in Nature Protection. University of California Press. Page 197. This trade caused severe losses to bird populations (for example, egrets and whooping cranes). Conservationists led a major campaign against the use of feathers in hats. This contributed to passage of the Lacey Act in 1900, and to changes in fashion. The ornamental feather market then largely collapsed.Feather trade , Smithsonian Institution More recently, rooster plumage has become a popular trend as a hairstyle accessory, with feathers formerly used as fishing lures now being used to provide color and style to hair. Today, feathers used in fashion and in military headdresses and clothes are obtained as a waste product of poultry farming, including chickens, geese, turkeys, pheasants, and ostriches. These feathers are dyed and manipulated to enhance their appearance, as poultry feathers are naturally often dull in appearance compared to the feathers of wild birds. Feather products manufacturing in Europe has declined in the last 60 years, mainly due to competition from Asia. Feathers have adorned hats at many prestigious events such as weddings and Ladies Day at racecourses (Royal Ascot). Evolution Fossil feather of an unidentified dinosaur The functional view on the evolution of feathers has traditionally focused on insulation, flight and display. Discoveries of non-flying Late Cretaceous feathered dinosaurs in China, however, suggest that flight could not have been the original primary function as the feathers simply would not have been capable of providing any form of lift. There have been suggestions that feathers may have had their original function in thermoregulation, waterproofing, or even as sinks for metabolic wastes such as sulphur. Recent discoveries are argued to support a thermoregulatory function, at least in smaller dinosaurs. Some researchers even argue that thermoregulation arose from bristles on the face that were used as tactile sensors. While feathers have been suggested as having evolved from reptilian scales, there are numerous objections to that idea, and more recent explanations have arisen from the paradigm of evolutionary developmental biology. Theories of the scale-based origins of feathers suggest that the planar scale structure was modified for development into feathers by splitting to form the webbing; however, that developmental process involves a tubular structure arising from a follicle and the tube splitting longitudinally to form the webbing. The number of feathers per unit area of skin is higher in smaller birds than in larger birds, and this trend points to their important role in thermal insulation, since smaller birds lose more heat due to the relatively larger surface area in proportion to their body weight. The miniaturization of birds also played a role in the evolution of powered flight. The coloration of feathers is believed to have evolved primarily in response to sexual selection. In one fossil specimen of the paravian Anchiornis huxleyi, the features are so well preserved that the melanosome (pigment cells) structure can be observed. By comparing the shape of the fossil melanosomes to melanosomes from extant birds, the color and pattern of the feathers on Anchiornis could be determined. Anchiornis was found to have black-and-white-patterned feathers on the forelimbs and hindlimbs, with a reddish-brown crest. This pattern is similar to the coloration of many extant bird species, which use plumage coloration for display and communication, including sexual selection and camouflage. It is likely that non-avian dinosaur species utilized plumage patterns for similar functions as modern birds before the origin of flight. In many cases, the physiological condition of the birds (especially males) is indicated by the quality of their feathers, and this is used (by the females) in mate choice. Additionally, when comparing different Ornithomimus edmontonicus specimens, older individuals were found to have a pennibrachium (a wing-like structure consisting of elongate feathers), while younger ones did not. This suggests that the pennibrachium was a secondary sex characteristic and likely had a sexual function. Feathers and scales are made up of two distinct forms of keratin, and it was long thought that each type of keratin was exclusive to each skin structure (feathers and scales). However, a study published in 2006 confirmed the presence of feather keratin in the early stages of development of American alligator scales. This type of keratin, previously thought to be specific to feathers, is suppressed during embryological development of the alligator and so is not present in the scales of mature alligators. The presence of this homologous keratin in both birds and crocodilians indicates that it was inherited from a common ancestor. This may suggest that crocodilian scales, bird and dinosaur feathers, and pterosaur pycnofibres are all developmental expressions of the same primitive archosaur skin structures; suggesting that feathers and pycnofibers could be homologous. =Feathered dinosaurs= Archaeopteryx lithographica (Berlin specimen) Several non-avian dinosaurs had feathers on their limbs that would not have functioned for flight. One theory suggests that feathers originally evolved on dinosaurs due to their insulation properties; then, small dinosaur species which grew longer feathers may have found them helpful in gliding, leading to the evolution of proto-birds like Archaeopteryx and Microraptor zhaoianus. Another theory posits that the original adaptive advantage of early feathers was their pigmentation or iridescence, contributing to sexual preference in mate selection. Dinosaurs that had feathers or protofeathers include Pedopenna daohugouensis and Dilong paradoxus, a tyrannosauroid which is 60 to 70 million years older than Tyrannosaurus rex. The majority of dinosaurs known to have had feathers or protofeathers are theropods, however featherlike \\"filamentous integumentary structures\\" are also known from the ornithischian dinosaurs Tianyulong and Psittacosaurus. The exact nature of these structures is still under study. However, it is believed that the stage-1 feathers (see Evolutionary stages section below) such as those seen in these two ornithischians likely functioned in display. In 2014, the ornithischian Kulindadromeus was reported as having structures resembling stage-3 feathers. Since the 1990s, dozens of feathered dinosaurs have been discovered in the clade Maniraptora, which includes the clade Avialae and the recent common ancestors of birds, Oviraptorosauria and Deinonychosauria. In 1998, the discovery of a feathered oviraptorosaurian, Caudipteryx zoui, challenged the notion of feathers as a structure exclusive to Avialae. Buried in the Yixian Formation in Liaoning, China, C. zoui lived during the Early Cretaceous Period. Present on the forelimbs and tails, their integumentary structure has been accepted as pennaceous vaned feathers based on the rachis and herringbone pattern of the barbs. In the clade Deinonychosauria, the continued divergence of feathers is also apparent in the families Troodontidae and Dromaeosauridae. Branched feathers with rachis, barbs, and barbules were discovered in many members including Sinornithosaurus millenii, a dromaeosaurid found in the Yixian formation (124.6 MYA). Previously, a temporal paradox existed in the evolution of feathers‚Äîtheropods with highly derived bird-like characteristics occurred at a later time than Archaeopteryx‚Äîsuggesting that the descendants of birds arose before the ancestor. However, the discovery of Anchiornis huxleyi in the Late Jurassic Tiaojishan Formation (160 MYA) in western Liaoning in 2009 resolved this paradox. By predating Archaeopteryx, Anchiornis proves the existence of a modernly feathered theropod ancestor, providing insight into the dinosaur-bird transition. The specimen shows distribution of large pennaceous feathers on the forelimbs and tail, implying that pennaceous feathers spread to the rest of the body at an earlier stage in theropod evolution. The development of pennaceous feathers did not replace earlier filamentous feathers. Filamentous feathers are preserved alongside modern-looking flight feathers ‚Äî including some with modifications found in the feathers of extant diving birds ‚Äî in 80 million year old amber from Alberta. Two small wings trapped in amber dating to 100 mya show plumage existed in some bird predecessors. The wings most probably belonged to enantiornithes, a diverse group of avian dinosaurs. A large phylogenetic analysis of early dinosaurs by Matthew Baron, David B. Norman and Paul Barrett (2017) found that Theropoda is actually more closely related to Ornithischia, to which it formed the sister group within the clade Ornithoscelida. The study also suggested that if the feather-like structures of theropods and ornithischians are of common evolutionary origin then it would be possible that feathers were restricted to Ornithoscelida. If so, then the origin of feathers would have likely occurred as early as the Middle Triassic. =Evolutionary stages= Diagram illustrating stages of evolution Several studies of feather development in the embryos of modern birds, coupled with the distribution of feather types among various prehistoric bird precursors, have allowed scientists to attempt a reconstruction of the sequence in which feathers first evolved and developed into the types found on modern birds. Feather evolution was broken down into the following stages by Xu and Guo in 2009: # Single filament # Multiple filaments joined at their base # Multiple filaments joined at their base to a central filament # Multiple filaments along the length of a central filament # Multiple filaments arising from the edge of a membranous structure # Pennaceous feather with vane of barbs and barbules and central rachis # Pennaceous feather with an asymmetrical rachis # Undifferentiated vane with central rachis However, Foth (2011) showed that some of these purported stages (stages 2 and 5 in particular) are likely simply artifacts of preservation caused by the way fossil feathers are crushed and the feather remains or imprints are preserved. Foth re-interpreted stage 2 feathers as crushed or misidentified feathers of at least stage 3, and stage 5 feathers as crushed stage 6 feathers. The following simplified diagram of dinosaur relationships follows these results, and shows the likely distribution of plumaceous (downy) and pennaceous (vaned) feathers among dinosaurs and prehistoric birds. The diagram follows one presented by Xu and Guo (2009) modified with the findings of Foth (2011). The numbers accompanying each name refer to the presence of specific feather stages. Note that 's' indicates the known presence of scales on the body. = In pterosaurs = Pterosaurs were long known to have filamentous fur-like structures covering their body known as pycnofibres, which were generally considered distinct from the \\"true feathers\\" of birds and their dinosaur kin. However, a 2018 study of two small, well-preserved pterosaur fossils from the Jurassic of Inner Mongolia, China indicated that pterosaurs were covered in an array of differently-structured pycnofibres (rather than just filamentous ones), with several of these structures displaying diagnostic features of feathers, such as non-veined grouped filaments and bilaterally branched filaments, both of which were originally thought to be exclusive to birds and other maniraptoran dinosaurs. Given these findings, it is possible that feathers have deep evolutionary origins in ancestral archosaurs, though there is also a possibility that these structures independently evolved to resemble bird feathers via convergent evolution. Mike Benton, the study's senior author, lent credence to the former theory, stating \\"We couldn‚Äôt find any anatomical evidence that the four pycnofiber types are in any way different from the feathers of birds and dinosaurs. Therefore, because they are the same, they must share an evolutionary origin, and that was about 250 million years ago, long before the origin of birds.\\" See also * Feather development * Delayed feathering in chickens * Hen feathering in cocks * List of poultry feathers * Pinioning * Plumage * White feather References Further reading * External links  McGraw, K.

It has a total area of with of land and of water. Madagascar is the fourth largest island and the 2nd largest island country in the world. The highest point is Maromokotro, in the Tsaratanana Massif region in the north of the island, at . The capital Antananarivo is in the Central Highlands near the centre of the island. It has the 25th largest Exclusive Economic Zone of . Madagascar is 400 kilometres (250 miles) east of mainland Africa. Geographical regions Madagascar can be divided into five general geographical regions: the east coast, the Tsaratanana Massif, the Central Highlands, the west coast, and the southwest. The highest elevations parallel the east coast. The total size is , which makes it the world's second largest island country. Land coverage (left) and topographical (right) maps of Madagascar =East coast= The east coast consists of a narrow band of lowlands about one kilometer wide, formed from the sedimentation of alluvial soils, and an intermediate zone composed of steep bluffs alternating with ravines bordering an escarpment of about in elevation, which gives access to the Central Highlands. The coastal region extends roughly from north of Baie d'Antongil, the most prominent feature on the Masoala Peninsula, to the far north of the island. The coastline is straight, with the exception of a bay, offering less in the way of natural harbors than the west coast. The Canal des Pangalanes, an -long lagoon formed naturally by the washing of sand up on the island by the Indian Ocean currents and by the silting of rivers, is a feature of the coast; it has been used both as a means of transportation up and down the coast and as a fishing area. The beach slopes steeply into deep water. The east coast is considered dangerous for swimmers and sailors because of the large number of sharks that frequent the shoreline. =Tsaratanana Massif= The Tsaratanana Massif region at the north end of the island contains, at , the highest point on the island. Further north is the Montagne d'Ambre (Ambohitra), which is of volcanic origin. The coastline is deeply indented; two prominent features are the natural harbor at Antsiranana (Diego Su√°rez), just south of the Cap d'Ambre (Tanjon' i Bobaomby), and the large island of Nosy Be to the west. The mountainous topography of the Tsaratanana Massif limits the potential of the port at Antsiranana by impeding the flow of traffic from other parts of the island. =Central Highlands= Village in the central highlands The Central Highlands, which range from in altitude, contain a wide variety of topographies: rounded and eroded hills, massive granite outcrops, extinct volcanoes, eroded peneplains, and alluvial plains and marshes, which have been converted into irrigated rice fields. The Central Highlands extend from the Tsaratanana Massif in the north to the Ivakoany Massif in the south. They are defined rather clearly by the escarpments along the east coast, and they slope gently to the west coast. The Central Highlands include the Anjafy High Plateaux; the volcanic formations of Itasy (Lake Itasy is in a volcanic crater) and the Ankaratra Massif, reaching a height of . The Isalo Roiniforme Massif lies between the central highlands and the west coast. Antananarivo, the national capital, is located in the northern portion of the Central Highlands at above sea level. A prominent feature of the Central Highlands is a rift valley running north to south, located east of Antananarivo and including Lac Alaotra, the largest body of water on the island. The lake is located above sea level and is bordered by two cliffs, rising to the west and to the east, which form the walls of a valley. This region has experienced geological subsidence, and earth tremors are frequent. =West coast= The west coast, composed of sedimentary formations, is more indented than the east coast, thus offering a number of harbors sheltered from cyclones, such as the harbor at Mahajanga. Deep bays and well-protected harbors have attracted explorers, traders, and pirates from Europe, Africa, and the Middle East since ancient times; thus, the area has served as an important bridge between Madagascar and the outside world. Silting up of harbors on this coast, caused by sediment from the high levels of erosion suffered inland in Madagascar, is a major problem. The broad alluvial plains found on the coast between Mahajanga and Toliara, which are believed to have great agricultural potential, are thinly inhabited, in many places covered with swamps of Madagascar mangroves, and remain largely unexplored, although they are the subject of mineral and hydrocarbon exploration activity. The giant oil fields of Tsimiroro (heavy oil) and Bemolanga (ultra heavy oil) lie towards the west of the island. =Southwest= The southwest is bordered on the east by the Ivakoany Massif and on the north by the Isala Roiniforme Massif. It includes two regions along the south coast, the Mahafaly Plateau and the desert region occupied by the Antandroy people. Rivers and lakes The Mananara and Mangoro rivers flow from the Central Highlands to the east coast, as does the Maningory, which flows from Lake Alaotra. Other rivers flowing east into the Indian Ocean include the Bemarivo, the Ivondro, and the Mananjary. These rivers tend to be short because the watershed is located close to the east coast. Owing to the steep elevations, they flow rapidly, often over spectacular waterfalls. The rivers flowing to the west coast discharge into the Mozambique Channel and tend to be lengthier and have a lesser gradient. The major rivers on the west coast are the Sambirano, the Mahajamba, the Betsiboka (part of Mahajanga is located at the mouth), the Mania, the North and South Mahavavy, the Mangoky, and the Onilahy. The Ikopa, which flows past Antananarivo, is a tributary of the Betsiboka. The Onilahy, located in the driest part of the island, occasionally dries up during droughts. Important lakes, aside from Alaotra, include Lake Kinkony in the northwest, Lake Itasy in the center and Lake Ihotry in the southwest.

Its west coast was formed when Africa broke off from Gondwana around 165 million years ago. Madagascar eventually broke off from India about 88 million years ago. It is geologically located within the Somali plate. =Soils= Madagascar has been called the \\"Great Red Island\\" because of the prominence of red lateritic soils. The red soils predominate the Central Highlands, although there are much richer soils in the regions of former volcanic activity, Itasy and Ankaratra, and Tsaratanana to the north. A narrow band of alluvial soils is found all along the east coast and at the mouths of the major rivers on the west coast; clay, sand, and limestone mixtures are found in the west; and shallow or skeletal laterite and limestone are located in the south. Deforestation and grazing cause aggressive erosion in many locations. Climate alt= The climate is tropical along the coast, temperate inland, and arid in the south. The weather is dominated by the southeastern trade winds that originate in the Indian Ocean anticyclone, a center of high atmospheric pressure that seasonally changes its position over the ocean. Madagascar has two seasons: a warm, wet season from November to April; and a cooler, dry season from May to October. There is, however, great variation in climate owing to elevation and position relative to dominant winds. Overall, surface water is most abundant along the east coast and in the far north (with the exception of the area around Cap d'Ambre, which has relatively little surface water). Amounts diminish to the west and south, and the driest regions are in the extreme south. The east coast has a tropical rainforest climate; being most directly exposed to the trade winds, it has the highest rainfall, averaging as high as annually in some places. This region has a hot, humid climate in which tropical fevers are endemic. Destructive cyclones occur during the rainy season, coming in principally from the direction of the Mascarene Islands. Because rain clouds discharge much of their moisture east of the highest elevations on the island, the Central Highlands are drier and, owing to the altitude, also cooler. Thunderstorms are common during the rainy season in the Central Highlands and the eastern coastal lowlands. Antananarivo receives practically all of its average annual of rainfall between November and April. The dry season is sunny, although somewhat chilly, especially in the mornings. Although frosts are rare in Antananarivo, they are common at higher elevations. Hail is common in many of the higher areas of the island (including Antananarivo), but there is no snowfall except on the Ankaratra massif where above it may occasionally fall and even remain for several days. The west coast is drier than either the east coast or the Central Highlands because the trade winds lose their humidity by the time they reach this region. The southwest and the extreme south are semidesert; as little as of rain falls annually at Toliara. Madagascar occasionally experiences the impact of cyclones. During February 2‚Äì4, 1994, Madagascar was struck by Cyclone Geralda, the worst cyclone to come ashore on the island since 1927. The cyclone killed seventy people and destroyed enough property to leave approximately 500,000 homeless, including 30,000 in Antananarivo and 80,000 in Toamasina. The cyclone also significantly damaged the country's infrastructure, most notably coastal roads, railroads, and telecommunications, as well as agriculture. Damage was estimated at US$45 million. Flora and fauna Baobabs near Morondava The island of Madagascar has been described as an \\"alternate world\\" or a \\"world apart\\" because of the uniqueness and rarity of many of its plant and animal species. Their characteristics are believed to reflect the island's origins as a part of Gondwanaland and its many millions of years of isolation following the breakup of the landmass. Many of the characteristic African species‚Äîlarge mammals such as the elephant, rhinoceros, giraffe, zebra, and antelope and predators such as lions and leopards‚Äîdo not exist in Madagascar. In addition, the island has been spared the great variety of venomous snakes indigenous to the African continent. Although it is assumed that most life forms on the island had an African (or South American) origin, isolation has allowed old species elsewhere extinctto survive and new species unique to the island to evolve. Thus, a great number of plant, insect, reptile, and fish species are endemic to Madagascar, and all indigenous land mammal species66 in allare unique to the island. Madagascar was once covered almost completely by forests, but slash and burn practices for dry rice cultivation has denuded most of the landscape, especially in the Central Highlands. Rain forests are concentrated on the steep hillsides along a slender north-south axis bordering the east coast, from the Tsaratanana Massif in the north to Tolagnaro in the south. Secondary growth, which has replaced the original forest and consists to a large extent of traveller's trees, raffia palm, and baobabs, is found in many places along the east coast and in the north. The vegetation of the Central Highlands and the west coast is for the most part savanna or steppe, and coarse prairie grass predominates where erosion has not exposed the orange-red lateritic soil. In the southwest, the vegetation is adapted to desert conditions. The remaining rain forest contains a great number of unique plant species. The country has some 900 species of orchid. Bananas, mangoes, coconut, vanilla, and other tropical plants grow on the coasts, and the eucalyptus tree, brought from Australia, is widespread today. Wood and charcoal from the forests are used to meet 80% of domestic fuel needs. As a result, wood has become scarce. In 1990, the World Bank launched an environmental program that has increased the planting of pine and eucalyptus to satisfy fuel needs. Natural resources Madagascar has a number of natural resources, including graphite, chromite, coal, bauxite, rare Earth elements, salt, quartz, tar sands, semi-precious stones and mica. There are also fishing areas offshore and potential for hydropower. In 2011, it was estimated that 5.96% of the land area was used for arable land and 1.02% had permanent crops. Twenty-six percent of the land is forested. The majority of the population depends on subsistence farming, largely rice and cattle. The manufacturing sector is small but growing. Environmental issues Madagascar is currently suffering in some areas from soil erosion as a result of deforestation and overgrazing, desertification, and contamination of surface water with raw sewage and organic waste. Several species of flora and fauna that are unique to the islands are endangered. Regular cyclones cause flooding in low-lying coastal regions.

These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the pressures of a growing human population. Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian, Bantu, Arab, South Asian, Chinese and European. The majority of the population of Madagascar today is a mixture of Austronesian, Bantu, North Indian, Arab and Somali settlers., p. 101. Centuries of intermarriages created the Malagasy people, who primarily speak Malagasy, an Austronesian language with Bantu, Malay, Arabic, French and English influences. Most of the genetic makeup of the average Malagasy, however, reflects an almost equal blend of Austronesian and Bantu, especially in coastal regions. Other populations often intermixed with the existent population to a more limited degree or have sought to preserve a separate community from the majority Malagasy. Austronesians expansion map An Austronesian outrigger canoe; Malagasy vahoaka \\"people\\" is from Proto-Malayo- Polynesian *va-waka \\"people of the canoe\\". The Vahoaka Ntaolo, the first Austronesian ancestors of the Malagasy, probably used similar canoes to reach the great island from the Sunda Islands By the Middle Ages, over a dozen predominant ethnic identities had emerged on the island, typified by rule under a local chieftain. Among some communities, such as the Sakalava, Merina and Betsimisaraka, leaders seized the opportunity to unite these disparate communities and establish true kingdoms under their rule. These kingdoms increased their wealth and power through exchanges with European, Arab and other seafaring traders, whether they were legitimate vessels or pirates. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, pirate activity in the coastal areas of Madagascar was common. The purported free pirate colony of Libertatia was established on √éle Sainte-Marie, originally populated by local Malagasy. The Sakalava and Merina kingdoms in particular exploited European trade to strengthen the power of their kingdoms, trading Malagasy slaves in exchange for European firearms and other goods. Throughout this time, European and Arab seafarers operating in the Indian Ocean traded with coastal communities, and Europeans made several unsuccessful attempts to claim and colonize the island. Beginning in the early 19th century, the British and French colonial empires competed for influence in Madagascar. By the turn of the 19th century, King Andrianampoinimerina had reunited the highly populous Kingdom of Imerina, located in the central highlands with its capital at Antananarivo. His son, Radama I, began to exert its authority over the island's other polities and was the first Malagasy sovereign to be recognized by a foreign power as the ruler of the greater Merina Kingdom. Over the 19th century, a series of Merina monarchs engaged in the process of modernization through close diplomatic ties to Britain that led to the establishment of European-style schools, government institutions and infrastructure. Christianity, introduced by members of the London Missionary Society, was made the state religion under Queen Ranavalona II and her prime minister, highly influential statesman Rainilaiarivony. Political wrangling between Britain and France in the 1880s saw Britain recognize France's claim to authority on the island, leading in 1890 to the Malagasy Protectorate, which was unrecognized by the government of Madagascar. The French launched two military campaigns known as the Franco-Hova Wars to force submission, finally capturing the capital in September 1895. This sparked the widespread Menalamba rebellion against French rule that was crushed in 1897; the monarchy was held responsible and dissolved, and the queen and her entourage exiled to Reunion and later Algeria, where she died in 1917. Following conquest, the French abolished Slavery in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed.Shillington (2005), p. 878 In French Madagascar, Malagasy were required to fulfill corv√©e labor on French-run plantations, which generated high revenues for the colonial administration. Opportunities for Malagasy to access education or skilled positions within the colonial structure were limited, although some basic services like schools and clinics were extended to coastal areas for the first time. The capital city was largely transformed and modernized, and the royal palaces were transformed into a school and later a museum. Although Malagasy were initially prevented from forming political parties, several militant nationalist secret societies emerged, of which the most prominent was Vy Vato Sakelika, founded by Ny Avana Ramanantoanina. Many Malagasy were conscripted to fight for France in World Wars I and II, and during the latter Madagascar came under Vichy control before being captured and held by the British in the Battle of Madagascar. At the Brazzaville Conference of 1944, Charles de Gaulle gave colonies the status of overseas territory and the right to representatives in the French National Assembly; when a bill proposed by Malagasy delegates of the Mouvement d√©mocratique de la r√©novation malgache for Madagascar's independence was not passed, militant nationalists led an unsuccessful Malagasy uprising (1947‚Äì1948), during which the French military committed atrocities that deeply scarred the population. The country gained full independence from France in 1960 in the wake of decolonization. Under the leadership of President Philibert Tsiranana, Madagascar's First Republic (1960‚Äì1972) was established as a democratic system modeled on that of France. This period was characterized by continued economic and cultural dependence upon France, provoking resentment and sparking the rotaka, popular movements among farmers and students that ultimately ushered in the socialist Democratic Republic of Madagascar under Admiral Didier Ratsiraka (1975‚Äì1992) distinguished by economic isolationism and political alliances with pro-Soviet states. As Madagascar's economy quickly unraveled, standards of living declined dramatically and growing social unrest was increasingly met with violent repression on the part of the Ratsiraka government. By 1992, free and fair multiparty elections were held, ushering in the democratic Third Republic (1992‚Äì2009). Under the new constitution, the Malagasy public elected successive presidents Albert Zafy, Didier Ratsiraka, and Marc Ravalomanana. This latter was ousted in the 2009 Malagasy political crisis by a popular movement under the leadership of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, in what was widely characterized as a coup d'√©tat. Rajoelina ushered in the Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2010 and ruled Madagascar as president of the High Transitional Authority without recognition from the international community. Elections were held on December 20, 2013 to elect a new president and return the country to constitutional governance.  First inhabitants and settlements (500 BCE‚Äì700 CE)  = Archaeological evidence for date of first settlement = VaŒ≥imba- \\"Those of the forest\\" in Proto‚ÄìSoutheast Barito, the reconstructed ancestor of the Southeast Barito languages, which includes the languages spoken by the Dayak peoples of the Barito River in Borneo. The earliest unambiguous evidence of human presence in Madagascar was found at Andavakoera and dates to 490 CE.'The archaeological evidence for the earliest human presence in Madagascar comes from Andavakoera near Diego Suarez and is dated to AD420 (AD250-590, 2SDs) (Dewar & Wright 1996). There is some evidence for earlier human presence, but it is ambiguous or not widely studied yet. Archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000 BCE. There is potential evidence in the form of a cutmarked subfossil lemur bone from a palaeontological site, Taolambiby, in the southwest. One date was obtained, calibrated 530 to 300 BCE (Godfrey & Jungers 2003). The cutmarking looks plausible, but there is a potential problem of old carbon from the limestone landscape compromising the date, and there are no associated artifacts or archaeological sites in the vicinity. Nearly contemporaneous potential evidence comes from cannabis or humulus pollen which occurs in a pollen column from the central highlands at an interpolated date of c. 2200 Before Present (BP).Burney 1987 There is a hypothesis that cannabis may have reached Africa 3000 years ago. In 2009, archaeological excavations at Christmas River (south-central Madagascar) by Pat Wright and James Hansford located a purported elephant bird kill site, with bones showing human cut marks. These were dated to 8,500 BCE, but as yet there is no indication as to the identity of the hunters. Necho II's Phoenician expedition c. 595 BCE circumnavigated Africa but did not see Madagascar when passing through the Mozambique Channel, as it stayed within sight of land. The island was likely uninhabited. There is no archaeological evidence for human occupation in the highlands until around 1200. Finally, a cutmarked pygmy hippo bone from Ambolisatra has been dated and calibrated to between 60 BCE and 130 CE (2 SDs), but it is from a coastal swamp without indications of settlement in a heavily karstic region. Moreover, a similar bone from the same collection from a nearby site gave two widely divergent dates of 2020 and 3495 BP (MacPhee & Burney 1991). Transient visits to Madagascar that did not result in enduring settlement cannot be ruled out, and may have left some traces.Peter Forster, Shuichi Matsumutra, Matthieu Vizuete-Forster, Petya Belinda Blumbach & Robert Dewar (2008) \\"The Genetic Prehistory of Madagascar's Female Asian Lineages\\", In: , pp71-72 = A common Austronesian origin: The Vahoaka Ntaolo = Factual information about the peopling of Madagascar remains incomplete, but much recent multidisciplinary research and work in archaeology,Burney et alii (2004) genetics,Hurles et alii (2005) linguistics,Dahl O.

The Borobudur Ship Expedition in 2003‚Äì2004 affirmed scholars' ideas that ships from ancient Indonesia could have reached Madagascar and the west African coast for trade from the 8th century and after. A traditional Borobudur ship with outriggers was reconstructed and sailed in this expedition from Jakarta to Madagascar and Ghana. As for the ancient route, one possibility is that Indonesian Austronesians came directly across the Indian Ocean from Java to Madagascar. It is likely that they went through the Maldives where evidence of old Indonesian boat design and fishing technology persists until the present.P. Y. Manguin.

The Malagasy language originated from the Southeast Barito language, and Ma'anyan language is its closest relative, with numerous Malay and Javanese loanwords.Otto Chr. Dahl, Malgache et Maanjan: une comparaison linguistique, Egede-Instituttet Avhandlinger, no. 3 (Oslo: Egede- Instituttet, 1951), p. 13.There are also some Sulawesi loanwords, which Adelaar attributes to contact prior to the migration to Madagascar: See K. Alexander Adelaar, ‚ÄúThe Indonesian Migrations to Madagascar: Making Sense of the Multidisciplinary Evidence‚Äù, in Truman Simanjuntak, Ingrid Harriet Eileen Pojoh and Muhammad Hisyam (eds.), Austronesian Diaspora and the Ethnogeneses of People in Indonesian Archipelago, (Jakarta: Indonesian Institute of Sciences, 2006), pp. 8‚Äì9. It is known that Ma'anyan people were brought as laborers and slaves by Malay and Javanese people in their trading fleets, which reached Madagascar by ca. 50‚Äì500 AD. These pioneers are known in the Malagasy oral tradition as the Ntaolo, from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *tau-ulu, literally 'first men', from *tau, 'man', and *ulu, 'head; first; origin, beginning.Randriamasimanana, \\"The Malayo-Polynesian Origin of Malagasy\\" It is likely that those ancient people called themselves *va-waka, \\"the canoe people\\" from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *va, 'people', and *waka 'canoe'. Today the term means 'people' in Malagasy. Men in an Outrigger Canoe Headed for Shore, an oil painting by Arman Manookian depicting the Vezo people, The Southeast Asian origin of the first Malagasy people explains certain features common among the Malagasy, for instance, the epicanthic fold common among all Malagasy whether coastal or highlands, whether pale, dark or copper skinned. This original population (vahoaka ntaolo) can be called the \\"Proto-Malagasy\\". They are the source of: * the Malagasy language, common to the whole island, which shares many common roots with the Austronesian languages of Barito subgroup, which originated in South Kalimantan, such as Ma'anyan.O. Dahl, op. cit., Adelaar, op. cit., Simon, op. cit. * Malagasy cultural traditions shared with Austronesians of Taiwan, the Pacific Islands, Indonesia, New Zealand, and the Philippines including ancient customs, such as burying the dead within a canoe in the sea or in a lake, the cultivation of traditional Austronesian crops such as taro or , banana, coconut, and sugar cane, traditional architecture with a square house plan, music and musical instruments such as the conch, the drum, the xylophone, flute, or the tube zither,schmidhoffer, A.

One can only assume that the island of Madagascar played an important role in trade, particularly that of spice trade (especially cinnamon) and timber between Southeast Asia and the Middle East, directly or through the African coast and Madagascar. A Sumatran village showing several traditional houses (Malagasy levu). The vahoaka ntaolo villages of Madagascar were probably similar in the first millennium AD. This model is still currently present on every coast and in the remote inland areas and forests. =Vazimba and Vezo= The first known concentrated population of human settlers emerged along the southeastern coast of the island, although the first landfall may have been made on the northern coast. Upon arrival, early settlers practiced tavy (slash-and-burn agriculture) to clear the virgin coastal rainforests for the cultivation of their crops. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's wealth of megafauna, including giant lemurs, elephant birds, giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction. By 600, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and began clearing the forests of the central highlands (Imerina), where they particularly planted taro (saonjo) and probably rice (vary). These Vahoaka Ntaolo, hunters-gatherers and farmers, who decided to settle \\"in the forest\\", especially in the forests of the central highlands are known by the tradition as the Vazimba (from *ba/va-yimba- 'those of the forest', from *yimba- 'forest' in Proto‚ÄìSoutheast Barito, today barimba or orang rimba in MalaySimon, Pierre (2006), La langue des anc√™tres. Une p√©riodisation du malgache de l‚Äôorigine au XVIe si√®cle, Paris, L‚ÄôHarmattan., p. 245). Rafandrana, an ancestor of the Merina royal dynasty, for example, is known to have been a Vazimba. Rafohy and Rangita, the two founding queens of the Merina royalty, were also called Vazimbas. The taro (saonjo in Malagasy) is, according to an old Malagasy proverb, \\"the elder of the rice\\" (Ny saonjo no zokin'ny vary), and was also a staple diet for the proto-Austronesians On the other side, the fishermen who, from the beginning, remained on the southwestern coast (probably the coasts of the first landing) were, according to the linguists, probably originally called the Vezo (from *ba/va/be/ve-jau ‚Äì \\"those of the coast\\", borrowed from Proto-Malayo-Javanese, today veju in Bugis, bejau in Malay, and bajo in Javanese), which today is still the name of a Southwestern tribe. The suling is an Indonesian cousin of the sodina After the arrival of the newcomers (see below), as growing population density necessitated higher crop yields, irrigated rice paddies emerged in Betsileo country by 1600 and were complemented with terraced paddies throughout the central highlands a century later.Campbell (1993), p.116 Zebu were introduced around 1000 by Bantu-speaking migrants from the African Great Lakes region (see below), who maintained large herds. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage in the central highlands had largely transformed the region from a forest ecosystem to barren grassland by the 17th century. Traders, explorers, and immigration (700‚Äì1500) By the mid-first millennium (ca 700) until about 1500, the inner Vazimbas as much as the coastal Vezos clans welcome new visitors or immigrants. These goods and/or slave traders from the Middle East (Shirazi Persians, Omani Arabs, Arabized Jews, accompanied by Bantus from southeast Africa), and from Asia (Gujarat Indians, Malays, Javanese, Bugis) were sometimes integrated within the coastal Vezos and the inner Vazimbas clans. =Omani Arabs (from the 7th century)= The written history of Madagascar begins in the 7th century when Omanis established trading posts along the northwest coast and introduced Islam, the Arabic script (used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as the sorabe alphabet), Arab astrology and other cultural elements. During this early period, Madagascar served as an important transoceanic trading port for the East African coast that gave Africa a trade route to the Silk Road and served simultaneously as a port for incoming ships. There is evidence that Bantu or Swahili sailors or traders may have begun sailing to the western shores of Madagascar as early as around the 6th and 7th century. According to the traditions of some Malagasy peoples, the first Bantus and Arabs to settle in Madagascar came as refugees from the civil wars that followed the death of Muhammad in 632.Sigmund Edland, Tantaran‚Äôny Fiangonana Loterana Malagasy Beginning in the 10th or 11th century, Arabic and Zanzibari slavers worked their way down the Swahili coast in their dhows and established settlements on the west coast of Madagascar. Notably they included the Zafiraminia, traditional ancestors of the Antemoro, Antanosy and other east coast ethnicities. The last wave of Arab immigrants, the Antalaotra, immigrated from Swahili colonies. They settled the northwest of the island (the Mahajanga area) and introduced, for the first time, Islam to Madagascar. Arab immigrants, though few in number compared to the native Austronesians and Bantus, nevertheless left a lasting impression. The Malagasy names for seasons, months, days, and coins in certain regions come from Arabic origins, as do cultural features such as the practice of circumcision, the communal grain-pool, and different forms of salutation (such as salama). =Neo-Austronesians: Malays, Javanese, Bugis, and Orang Laut (from the 8th century)= Canoe-sarcophagus of the Dayak: a burial that recalls the Malagasy tradition that former Ntaolo Vazimba and Vezo buried their dead in canoe- sarcophagi in the sea or in a lake According to oral tradition,Ramilison E.,Andriantomara-Andriamamilazabe: loharanon'ny andriana nanjaka teto Imerina, Antananarivo, Lutheran Printing new Austronesian clans (Malays, Javanese, Bugis, and orang-orang laut),Adelaar, KA (2006) \\"The Indonesian migrations to Madagascar: Making sense of the multidisciplinary evidence\\") historically referred to in general, regardless of their native island, as the \\"Hova\\" (from Old Bugis uwa, \\"commoner\\") landed in the north-west and east coast of the island. Adelaar's observations of Old Malay (Sanskritised), Old Javanese (Sanskritised) and Old Bugis borrowings in the initial Proto-Southeast-Barito language indicate that the first Hova waves came probably in the 7th century at the earliest.Adelaar, ‚ÄúThe Indonesian Migrations to Madagascar‚Äù, p. 15. Marre and Dahl pointed out that the number of Sanskrit words in Malagasy is very limited compared with the large number now found in Indonesian languages, which means that the Indonesian settlers must have come at an early stage of Hindu influence, that is ca. 400 AD.Dahl, Otto Chr. Malgache et Maanjan: une Comparaison Linguistique, Egede-Instituttet Avhandlinger, no. 3. Oslo: Egede- Instituttet, 1951. The Hova were probably derived from Indonesian thalassocracies.

They for the most part allied with Vazimba clans:Ravelojaona et alii 1937 * In the Northwest area of the current Ankoala (from kuala, \\"estuary\\" in Malay and Indonesian) where the Hova Orang Laut (Antalaotra in Malagasy) had probably established their base for their Indian Ocean operations. * On the east coast (Betsimisaraka) where the Hova leaders were also called Filo (ha) be by the \\"neo-Vezo\\" clans. * In the southeast where the leaders (\\"Diana\\") of the Zafiraminia and Zafikazimambo clans allied with the \\"neo-Vezo\\" and founded the later Antaisaka, Antaimoro and Antambahoaka kingdoms. * In the west: the Maroserana dynasty which founded the Sakalava Kingdom is itself a result of Zafiraminia on the east coast. * In the Center where repeated alliances among the Hova leaders (the andriana) (such as Andrianerinerina, Andriantomara and their descendants) with the chiefs of Vazimba clans (such as Rafandrana and his descendantsCallet, F., op. cit.) led to the Merina and Betsileo Kingdoms. With the arrival of Islam, Persian and Arab traders soon supplanted the Indonesians on the coast of Africa and eventually extended their control over the Comoro Islands and parts of the coast of Madagascar. Meanwhile, with competition in the new joint naval powers of Song China and Chola South India, the thalassocracies of Indonesia were in rapid decline, though the Portuguese still encountered Javanese sailors in Madagascar in the . =Bantus (from the 9th century)= There is archaeological evidence that Bantu peoples, agro- pastoralists from East Africa, may have begun migrating to the island as early as the 6th and 7th century. Other historical and archaeological records suggest that some of the Bantus were descendants of Swahili sailors and merchants who used dhows to traverse the seas to the western shores of Madagascar.History of Madagascar An economic history of Imperial Madagascar, 1750‚Äì1895.

Other than its size and location, everything about the island in the book describes southeastern Africa, not Madagascar. European contact began on August 10, 1500, when the Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island after his ship separated from a fleet going to India. The Portuguese traded with the islanders and named the island S√£o Louren√ßo (Saint Lawrence). In 1666, Fran√ßois Caron, the director general of the newly formed French East India Company, sailed to Madagascar. The company failed to establish a colony on Madagascar but established ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon (now R√©union) and Isle de France (now Mauritius). In the late 17th century, the French established trading posts along the east coast. On √éle Sainte-Marie, a small island off the northeastern coast of Madagascar, Captain Misson and his pirate crew allegedly founded the famous pirate utopia of Libertatia in the late 17th century. From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar was a favorite haunt for pirates. Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them Robert Drury, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century.From MADAGASCAR to the MALAGASY REPUBLIC, by Raymond K. Kent pg 65‚Äì71 Sailors sometimes called Madagascar \\"Island of the Moon\\".Madagascar: An Historical and Descriptive Account of the Island and Its Former Dependencies by Samuel Pasfield Oliver, p. 6. (excerpted in Google Book Search) European settlements By the 15th century, Europeans had wrested control of the spice trade from the Muslims. They did this by bypassing the Middle East and sending their cargo-ships around the Cape of Good Hope to India. The Portuguese mariner Diogo Dias became the first European to set foot on Madagascar when his ship, bound for India, blew off course in 1500. In the ensuing two-hundred years, the English and French tried (and failed) to establish settlements on the island. Fever, dysentery, hostile Malagasy, and the trying arid climate of southern Madagascar soon terminated the English settlement near Toliara in 1646. Another English settlement in the north in √éle Sainte-Marie came to an end in 1649. The French colony at T√¥lanaro (Fort Dauphin) fared a little better: it lasted thirty years. On Christmas night 1672, local Antanosy tribesmen, perhaps angry because fourteen French soldiers in the fort had recently divorced their Malagasy wives to marry fourteen French orphan-women sent out to the colony, massacred the fourteen grooms and thirteen of the fourteen brides. The Antanosy then besieged the stockade at T√¥lanaro for eighteen months. A ship of the French East India Company rescued the surviving thirty men and one widow in 1674. In 1665, Fran√ßois Caron, the Director General of the newly formed French East India Company, sailed to Madagascar. The Company failed to found a colony on Madagascar but established ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon and √éle-de-France (today's R√©union and Mauritius respectively). In the late 17th century, the French established trading-posts along the east coast. Pirates and slave-traders Map of Madagascar and surroundings, circa 1702‚Äì1707 Map of Madagascar and the western portion of the East Indies, circa 1702‚Äì1707 Between 1680 and 1725, Madagascar became a pirate stronghold. Many unfortunate sailors became shipwrecked and stranded on the island. Those who survived settled down with the natives, or more often, found French or English colonies on the island or even pirate havens and thus became pirates themselves. One such case, that of Robert Drury,From Madagascar to the Malagasy Republic by Raymond K. Kent, Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1976 (), pages 55‚Äì71. resulted in a journal giving one of the few written depictions of southern Madagascar in the 18th century. Pirate luminaries such as William Kidd, Henry Every, John Bowen, and Thomas Tew made Antongil Bay and √éle Sainte-Marie (a small island 12 miles off the northeast coast of Madagascar) their bases of operations. The pirates plundered merchant ships in the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf. They deprived Europe-bound ships of their silks, cloth, spices, and jewels. Vessels captured going in the opposite direction (to India) lost their coin, gold, and silver. The pirates robbed the Indian cargo ships that traded between ports in the Indian Ocean as well as ships commissioned by the East India Companies of France, England, and the Netherlands. The pilgrim fleet sailing between Surat in India and Mocha on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula were a favorite target, because the wealthy Muslim pilgrims often carried jewels and other finery with them to Mecca. Merchants in India, various ports of Africa, and R√©union showed willingness to fence the pirates' stolen goods. The low-paid seamen who manned merchant ships in the Indian Ocean hardly put up a fight, seeing as they had little reason or motivation to risk their lives. The pirates often recruited crewmen from the ships they plundered. With regard to piracy in Malagasy waters, note the (semi-)legendary accounts of the alleged pirate-state of Libertatia. Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, certain Malagasy tribes occasionally waged wars to capture and enslave prisoners. They either sold the slaves to Arab traders or kept them on-hand as laborers. Following the arrival of European slavers, human slaves became more valuable, and the coastal tribes of Madagascar took to warring with each other to obtain prisoners for the lucrative slave-trade. Instead of spears and cutlasses, the tribesmen fought with muskets, musket-balls, and gunpowder that they obtained from the Europeans, conducting fierce and brutal wars. On account of their relationship to the pirates, the Betsimisaraka in eastern Madagascar had more firearms than anyone else. They overpowered their neighbors, the Antankarana and Tsimihety, and even raided the Comoro Islands. As the tribe on the west coast with the most connections to the slave trade, the Sakalava people also had access to guns and powder. Today, the people of Madagascar can be considered as the product of mixing between the first occupants, the vahoaka ntaolo Austronesians (Vazimbaand Vezo) and those arrived later (Hova neo-Austronesians, Persians, Arabs, Africans and Europeans). Genotypically, the original Austronesian heritage is more or less evenly distributed throughout the island. Researchers have noticed the \\"Polynesian motif\\" everywhere:Hurles et alii (2005), Ricaut et alii (2009), Hagelberg et alii (2008) an old marker of Austronesian populations from before the great immigration to the islands of Polynesia and Melanesia. This fact would require a starting common home among the Proto-Malagasy vahoaka ntaolo (gone west to Madagascar) and the ancestors of the current Polynesians (left for the Pacific Islands in the East) between 500 BCE ‚Äì 1 CE.  Feudal era (1500‚Äì1895)  Radama I, the first monarch of the kingdom unified central Madagascar. =Rise of the great kingdoms= Those new immigrants of the Middle Ages were a minority in numbers, yet their cultural contributions, political and technological to the neo-Vazimba and neo-Vezo world substantially altered their society and is the cause of the major upheavals of the sixteenth that led to the Malagasy feudal era. On the coasts, the integration of the East Asians, Middle Easterns, Bantus and Portuguese led to the establishment of the kingdoms of the Antakarana, Boina, Menabe and Vezo on the west coast, the Mahafaly and Antandroy in the south, and the Antesaka, Antambahoaka, Antemoro, Antanala and Betsimisaraka on the east coast. In the interior, the struggle for hegemony between the different Neo-Vazimba clans of central highlands, called the Hova by the coastal Neo-Vezo clans, led to the creation of the Merina, Betsileo, Bezanozano, Sihanaka, Tsimihety and Bara kingdoms. The birth of these kingdoms/tribes essentially altered the political structure of the ancient world of the Vahoaka Ntaolo, but for the most part the common language, customs, traditions, religion and economy was preserved. Among the Central Kingdoms, the most important were the Betsileo kingdoms (Fandriana, Fisakana, Manandriana, Isandra) to the south, and the Merina kingdoms to the north. These were definitively unified in the early 19th century by Andrianampoinimerina. His son and successor Radama I (reigning 1810‚Äì1828) opened his country to European influence exerted mainly by the British. With their support, he extended its authority over much of the island. From 1817, the central Merina kingdoms, Betsileo, Bezanozano, and Sihanaka, unified by Radama I were known to the outside world as the Kingdom of Madagascar. =Sakalava= The island's West clan chiefs began to extend their power through trade with their Indian Ocean neighbors, first with Arab, Persian and Somali traders who connected Madagascar with East Africa, the Middle East and India, and later with European slave traders.Cities of the Middle East and North Africa By Michael Dumper, Bruce E. Stanley, Janet L. Abu-Lug The wealth created in Madagascar through trade created a state system ruled by powerful regional monarchs known as the Maroserana. These monarchs adopted the cultural traditions of subjects in their territories and expanded their kingdoms. They took on divine status, and new nobility and artisan classes were created. Madagascar functioned as a contact port for the other Swahili seaport city-states such as Sofala, Kilwa, Mombasa and Zanzibar. By the Middle Ages, large chiefdoms began to dominate considerable areas of the island. Among these were the Betsimisaraka alliance of the eastern coast and the Sakalava chiefdoms of the Menabe (centered in what is now the town of Morondava) and of Boina (centered in what is now the provincial capital of Mahajanga). The influence of the Sakalava extended across what are now the provinces of Antsiranana, Mahajanga and Toliara. The island's chiefs began to extend their power through trade with their Indian Ocean neighbours, notably East Africa, the Middle East and India. Large chiefdoms began to dominate considerable areas of the island. Among these were the Sakalava chiefdoms of the Menabe, centred in what is now the town of Morondava, and of Boina, centered in what is now the provincial capital of Mahajanga (Majunga). The influence of the Sakalava extended across what are now the provinces of Antsiranana, Mahajanga and Toliara. According to local tradition, the founders of the Sakalava kingdom were Marosera√±a (or Maroseranana, \\"those who owned many ports\\") princes, from the Fiherenana (now Toliara). They quickly subdued the neighbouring princes, starting with the southern ones, in the Mahafaly area. The true founder of Sakalava dominance was Andriamisara; his son Andriandahifotsy (c1610-1658) then extended his authority northwards, past the Mangoky River. His two sons, Andriamanetiarivo and Andriamandisoarivo, extended gains further up to the Tsongay region (now Mahajanga). At about that time, the empire's unity starts to split, resulting in a southern kingdom (Menabe) and a northern kingdom (Boina). Further splits resulted, despite continued extension of the Boina princes' reach into the extreme north, in Antankarana country. The Sakalava rulers of this period are known through the memoirs of Europeans such as Robert Drury, James Cook, Barnvelt (1719), Valentyn (1726). =Merina monarchy= Madagascar‚ÄîGathering of The People for The Making of Laws (LMS, 1869, p.52) King Andrianampoinimerina (1785‚Äì1810) and his son, Radama I (1810‚Äì1828) succeeded in uniting nearly all of Madagascar under Merina rule. These kings and their successors descended from a line of ancient Merina royalty who ruled the lands of Imerina in the central Highlands of Madagascar since at least the 16th century. Even prior to their eventual domination and unification of the entire island, the political and cultural activities of Merina royalty were to leave an indelible mark on contemporary Malagasy identity. With the establishment of dominion over the greater part of the Highlands, Andrianampoinimerina became the first Merina monarch to be considered a king of Madagascar. The island continued to be ruled by a succession of Merina monarchs until the last of them, Ranavalona III, was deposed and exiled to Algeria by French forces who conquered and colonized the island in 1895. King Andrianampoinimerina Andrianampoinimerina, grandson of King Andriambelomasina and successor to his uncle King Andrianjafy, successfully reunited the fragmented Merina kingdom through a combination of diplomacy, strategic political marriages and successful military campaigns against rival princes. Andrianampoinimerina distinguished himself from other kings by codifying laws and supervising the building of dikes and trenches to increase the amount of arable land around his capital at Antananarivo in a successful bid to end the famines that had wracked Imerina for decades. The king ambitiously proclaimed: Ny ranomasina no valapariako (‚Äúthe sea is the boundary of my rice-field‚Äù), and by the time of his death in 1810 he had conquered the Bara and Betsileo highland tribes, laying the groundwork for expansion of his kingdom to the shores of the island. King Radama I (1810‚Äì1828) Andrianampoinimerina's son Radama I (Radama the Great) assumed the throne during a turning-point in European history that had repercussions for Madagascar. With the defeat of Napol√©on in 1814/1815, the balance of power in Europe and in the European colonies shifted in Britain's favor. The British, eager to exert control over the trade routes of the Indian Ocean, had captured the islands of R√©union and Mauritius from the French in 1810. Although they returned R√©union to France, they kept Mauritius as a base for expanding the British Empire. Mauritius's governor, in a bid to woo Madagascar from French control, recognized Radama I as King of Madagascar, a diplomatic maneuver meant to underscore the idea of the sovereignty of the island and thus to preclude claims by any European powers. Radama I signed treaties with the United Kingdom outlawing the slave trade and admitting Protestant missionaries into Madagascar. On the face of it, the terms of these treaties seem innocuous enough, but Protestant missionaries would spread British influence; and outlawing the slave trade would weaken R√©union's economy by depriving that island of slave laborers for France's sugar plantations. In return for outlawing the slave trade, Madagascar received what the treaty called \\"The Equivalent\\": an annual sum of a thousand dollars in gold, another thousand in silver, stated amounts of gunpowder, flints, and muskets, plus 400 surplus British Army uniforms. The governor of Mauritius also sent military advisers who accompanied and sometimes led Merina soldiers in their battles against the Sakalava and Betsimisaraka. In 1824, having defeated the Betsimisaraka, Radama I declared, \\"Today, the whole island is mine! Madagascar has but one master.\\" The king died in 1828 while leading his army on a punitive expedition against the Betsimisaraka. Queen Ranavalona I (1828‚Äì1861) Christians burned at the stake by Ranavalona I The 33-year reign of Queen Ranavalona I, the widow of Radama I, was characterized by an increase in the size of the Kingdom of Madagascar as it conquered neighboring states as well as a struggle to preserve the cultural and political sovereignty of Madagascar from French and British colonial designs. The queen repudiated the treaties that Radama I had signed with Britain and, in 1835 after issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar, she expelled British missionaries from the island and began persecuting Christian converts who would not renounce their religion. Malagasy Christians would remember this period as ny tany maizina, or \\"the time when the land was dark\\". During her reign regular warfare, disease, slavery, difficult forced labor and harsh measures of justice (Tangena ordeal) resulted in a high mortality rate among soldiers and civilians alike during her 33-year reign, with Madagascar's population reducing from 5 million in 1833 to 2.5 million in 1839. Unbeknownst to the queen, her son and heir, the crown-prince (the future Radama II), attended Roman Catholic masses in secret. The young man grew up under the influence of French nationals in Antananarivo. In 1854, he wrote a letter to Napol√©on III inviting France to invade and uplift Madagascar. On June 28, 1855 he signed the Lambert Charter. This document gave Joseph-Fran√ßois Lambert, an enterprising French businessman who had arrived in Madagascar only three weeks before, the exclusive right to develop all minerals, forests, and unoccupied land in Madagascar in exchange for a 10-percent royalty payable to the Merina monarchy. In years to come, the French would show the Lambert Charter and the prince's letter to Napol√©on III to explain the Franco-Hova Wars and the annexation of Madagascar as a colony. In 1857, the queen uncovered a plot by her son (the future Radama II) and French nationals in the capital to remove her from power. She immediately expelled all foreigners from Madagascar, sparing her son. Ranavalona died in 1861.  King Radama II (1861‚Äì1863)  In his brief two years on the throne, King Radama II re-opened trade with Mauritius and R√©union, invited Christian missionaries and foreigners to return to Madagascar, and re-instated most of Radama I's reforms. His liberal policies angered the aristocracy, however, and Rainivoninahitriniony, the prime minister, engineered a coup d'√©tat in which Radama II was strangled to death.

A council of princes headed by Rainilaiarivony approached Rabodo, the widow of Radama II, the day after the death of her husband. They gave her the conditions under which she could succeed to the throne. These conditions included the suppression of trial by ordeal as well as the monarchy's defense of freedom of religion. Rabodo, crowned queen on May 13, 1863 under the throne name of Rasoherina, reigned until her death on April 1, 1868.Fr√©d√©ric Randriamamonjy, Tantaran'i Madagasikara Isam-Paritra (The history of Madagascar by Region), pages 529‚Äì534. The Malagasy people remember Queen Rasoherina for sending ambassadors to London and Paris and for prohibiting Sunday markets. On June 30, 1865, she signed a treaty with the United Kingdom giving British citizens the right to rent land and property on the island and to have a resident ambassador. With the United States of America she signed a trade agreement that also limited the importation of weapons and the export of cattle. Finally, with France the queen signed a peace between her descendants and the descendants of the Emperor of France.Fr√©d√©ric Randriamamonjy, Tantaran'i Madagasikara Isam-Paritra (The history of Madagascar by Region), pages 529‚Äì534. Rasoherina married her Prime Minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, but public outcry against his involvement in the murder of Radama II soon forced his resignation and exile to Betsileo country south of Imerina. She then married his brother, Rainilaiarivony, head of the army at the time of Radama II's murder who was promoted to the post of Prime Minister upon the resignation and exile of his older brother. Rainilaiarivony would rule Madagascar from behind the scenes for the remaining 32 years of the Merina monarchy, marrying each of the final three queens of Madagascar in succession. Queen Ranavalona II (1868‚Äì1883) In 1869, Queen Ranavalona II, previously educated by the London Missionary Society, underwent baptism into the Church of England and subsequently made the Anglican faith the official state religion of Madagascar.Madagascar now has three dioceses in the autonomous Church of the Province of the Indian Ocean, part of the Anglican Communion. .

The reign of Queen Ranavalona II proved the heyday of British influence in Madagascar. British arms and troops arrived on the island by way of South Africa. Queen Ranavalona III (1883‚Äì1897) Her public coronation as queen took place on November 22, 1883 and she took the name Ranavalona III.

She also promised to do away with the French threat.Fr√©d√©ric Randriamamonjy, Tantaran'i Madagasikara Isam-Paritra (History of Madagascar by Region), pg 546. End of the monarchy Landing of the 40th Battaillon de Chasseur √† Pieds in Majunga, between 5 May and May 24, 1895. Angry at the cancellation of the Lambert Charter and seeking to restore property seized from French citizens, France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first Franco-Hova War (Hova as a name referring to the Merina aristocrats). At the war's end, Madagascar ceded Antsiranana (Di√©go Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 gold francs to the heirs of Joseph-Fran√ßois Lambert. In Europe, meanwhile, diplomats partitioning the African continent worked out an agreement whereby Britain, in order to obtain the Sultanate of Zanzibar, ceded its rights over Heligoland to (Germany) and renounced all claims to civilize Madagascar in favor of France. The agreement spelled the end of the independent native tribes of Madagascar. Rainilaiarivony had succeeded in playing Great Britain and France against one another, but now France could act without fear of reprisals from Britain. In 1895, a French flying column landed in Mahajanga (Majunga) and marched by way of the Betsiboka River to the capital, Antananarivo, taking the city's defenders by surprise (they had expected an attack from the much closer east coast). Twenty French soldiers died fighting and 6,000 died of malaria and other diseases before the second Franco-Hova War ended. In 1896 the French Parliament voted to annex Madagascar. The 103-year- old Merina monarchy ended with the royal family sent into exile in Algeria. =International recognition and modernization of the Kingdom (1817‚Äì1895)= The kingdom of Madagascar continued its transformation throughout the 19th century from a locally grown monarchy into a modern state. Before Radama I the Malagasy language was written in a script known as sorabe. In 1820 under the direction of David Jones, a Welsh missionary of the London Missionary Society, Radama I codified the new Malagasy Latin alphabet of 21 letters which replaced the old sorabe alphabet. By 1830 the Bible was the first book written in this new Malagasy Latin alphabet. It is the oldest complete translation of the bible into a sub-Saharan African language. The United States and the Kingdom of Madagascar concluded a commercial convention in 1867 after which Queen Rasoherina and Prime Minister Rainilaiarivoy exchanged gifts with president Andrew Johnson. A treaty of peace, friendship, and commerce was then signed in 1881. During the reign of Ranavalona I, early attempts at industrialization took place from 1835 under the direction of the French Jean Laborde (a survivor of a shipwreck off the east coast), producing soap, porcelain, metal tools and firearms (rifles, cannons, etc.).. In 1864 Antananarivo opened the first hospital and a modern medical school. Two years later appeared the first newspaper. A scientific journal in English (Antananarivo Annual) was released from 1875. In 1894, on the eve of the establishment of colonial rule, the schools of the kingdom, mainly led by the Protestant missions, were attended by over 200,000 students. French colonization Poster of the French war in Madagascar In the Berlin Treaty, the British accepted the claims of France to exert its influence on Madagascar, and a treaty of alliance between France and Madagascar was signed on December 17, 1885 by Queen Ranavalona III. Disagreements on the implementation of this treaty served as a pretext for the French invasion of 1895, which first met little resistance. The authority of the Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony, in power since 1864, had become very unpopular with the public. The British accepted the imposition of a French protectorate over Madagascar in 1890 in return for eventual British control over Zanzibar (subsequently part of Tanzania) and as part of an overall definition of spheres of influence in the area.See Allen and Covell, Historical Dictionary of Madagascar, pgs. xxx‚Äìxxxi The intention of the French was initially to maintain the protectorate in order to control the economy and foreign relations of the island. But later, the outbreak of the Menalamba rebellion and the arrival of General Gallieni (responsible for \\"pacifying\\" the country) in 1896 led to the colonization of the island and the exile of the queen to Algeria. In 1904‚Äì1905 Madagascar was the scene of a large-scale uprising by various tribes and tribal leaders, among whom Kotavy, a former French corporal who defected to the rebels, filled a preponderant role. Malagasy troops fought in France, Morocco, and Syria during World War II. Prior to the implementation of the Final Solution, Nazi Germany had considered the Madagascar Plan, which would have relocated European Jews to Madagascar. After France fell to the Germans in 1940, the Vichy government administered Madagascar until 1942, when British Empire troops occupied the strategic island in the Battle of Madagascar. The United Kingdom handed over control of the island to Free French Forces in 1943.  Revolt and decolonization (1947‚Äì1960)  In 1948, with French prestige at a low ebb, the French government, headed by Prime Minister Paul Ramadier of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) party, suppressed the Madagascar revolt, a nationalist uprising.A Country Study: Madagascar Library of CongressThe Cambridge Encyclopedia of Africa (1981)Dictionary of Wars, by George Childs Kohn (Facts on File, 1999)\\"B&J;\\": Jacob Bercovitch and Richard Jackson, International Conflict : A Chronological Encyclopedia of Conflicts and Their Management 1945‚Äì1995 (1997)Hartman, T., A World Atlas of Military History 1945‚Äì1984 (1984)\\"WHPSI\\": The World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators by Charles Lewis Taylor The French subsequently established reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully toward independence. The Malagasy Republic, proclaimed on October 14, 1958, became an autonomous state within the French Community. On March 26, 1960 France agreed to Madagascar becoming fully independent. On June 26, 1960 Madagascar became an independent country and Philibert Tsiranana became its first president.  Independence  =First Republic (1960‚Äì1972)= Tsiranana's rule represented continuation, with French settlers (or colons) still in positions of power. Unlike many of France's former colonies, the Malagasy Republic strongly resisted movements towards communism.Lonely Planet: Madagascar History In 1972, protests against these policies came to a head and Tsiranana had to step down. He handed power to General Gabriel Ramanantsoa of the army and his provisional government. This r√©gime reversed previous policy in favour of closer ties with the Soviet Union.BBC: Madagascar timeline On February 5, 1975, Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava became the President of Madagascar. After six days as head of the country, he died in an assassination while driving from the presidential palace to his home. Political power passed to Gilles Andriamahazo. =Second Republic (1972‚Äì1991)= On June 15, 1975, Lieutenant-Commander Didier Ratsiraka (who had previously served as foreign minister) came to power in a coup. Elected president for a seven-year term, Ratsiraka moved further towards socialism, nationalizing much of the economy and cutting all ties with France. These policies hastened the decline in the Madagascan economy that had begun after independence as French immigrants left the country, leaving a shortage of skills and technology behind. Ratsiraka's original seven-year term as President continued after his party (Avant-garde de la R√©volution Malgache or AREMA) became the only legal party in the 1977 elections. In the 1980s, Madagascar moved back towards France, abandoning many of its communist- inspired policies in favour of a market economy, though Ratsiraka still kept hold of power. Eventually, opposition, both within and without, forced Ratsiraka to consider his position and in 1992 the country adopted a new and democratic constitution. =Third Republic (1991‚Äì2002)= The first multi- party elections came in 1993, with Albert Zafy defeating Ratsiraka. Despite being a strong proponent of a liberal, free-market economy, Zafy ran on a ticket critical of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. During his presidency the country struggled to implement IMF and World Bank guidelines that were, on the short term, suicidal politically. As president Zafy was frustrated by the restraints placed upon the powers of his office by the new constitution. His quest for increased executive power put him on a collision course with the parliament led by then Prime Minister Francisque Ravony.Richard R. Marcus, \\"Political change in Madagascar: populist democracy or neopatrimonialism by another name?\\" , Institute for Security Studies, Occasional Paper 89, August 2004. Zafy eventually won the power he sought after but suffered impeachment at the hands of the disenfranchised parliament in 1996 for violating the constitution by refusing to promulgate specific laws. The ensuing elections saw a turnout of less than 50% and unexpectedly resulted in the re-election of Didier Ratsiraka. He moved further towards capitalism. The influence of the IMF and the World Bank led to widespread privatisation. Opposition to Ratsiraka began to grow again. Opposition parties boycotted provincial elections in 2000, and the 2001 presidential election produced more controversy. The opposition candidate Marc Ravalomanana claimed victory after the first round (in December) but the incumbent rejected this position. In early 2002 supporters of the two sides took to the streets and violent clashes took place. Ravalomanana claimed that fraud had occurred in the polls. After an April recount the High Constitutional Court declared Ravalomanana president. Ratsiraka continued to dispute the result but his opponent gained international recognition, and Ratsiraka had to go into exile in France, though forces loyal to him continued activities in Madagascar. =Post-Ratsiraka= Ravalomanana's I Love Madagascar party achieved overwhelming electoral success in December 2001 and he survived an attempted coup in January 2003. He used his mandate to work closely with the IMF and the World Bank to reform the economy, to end corruption and to realise the country's potential. Ratsiraka went on trial (in absentia) for embezzlement (the authorities charged him with taking $8m of public money with him into exile) and the court sentenced him to ten years' hard labour.BBC News: Ratsiraka gets 10 years hard labor Ravalomanana is credited with improving the country's infrastructure, such as roads, along with making improvements in education and health, but has faced criticism for his lack of progress against poverty; purchasing power is said to have declined during his time in office.\\"Opinion divided over Ravalomanana\\", IRIN, December 1, 2006.\\"Voter apathy as election day approaches\\", IRIN, December 1, 2006.

Ravalomanana ran for a second term in the presidential election held on December 3, 2006.\\"Ravalomanana likely to win presidential election\\" , IRIN, December 11, 2006.

He was sworn in for his second term on January 19, 2007.\\"Ravalomanana swears in as Malagasy President\\" , Xinhua News Agency, January 19, 2007. Ravalomanana dissolved the National Assembly in July 2007, prior to the end of its term, following a constitutional referendum earlier in the year. Ravalomanana said that a new election needed to be held so that the National Assembly would reflect the changes made in this referendum.\\"Madagascar leader dissolves parliament\\", AFP (IOL), July 24, 2007. He became involved in a political standoff after he closed the TV station belonging to Antananarivo mayor Andry Rajoelina. In January 2009, protests which then turned violent were organized and spearheaded by Andry Rajoelina, the mayor of the capital city of Antananarivo and a prominent opponent of President Ravalomanana. The situation fundamentally changed on March 10, 2009 when army leaders forced the recently appointed defense secretary to resign (the previous one had decided to resign after the killings by the presidential guard on February 7, 2009). They also announced that they gave the opponents 72 hours to dialogue and find a solution to the crisis before they would take further action. This move came after the leaders of the main military camp had announced a day earlier that they would not execute orders coming from the presidency any more since their duty was to protect the people, and not to oppress them, as groups of the military had done over the last few days.\\"Army calls politicians to find solution\\", [\\"RFI, in french\\"], March 11, 2009.\\"Madagascar: Army Threatens to Intervene\\", [\\"Allafrica\\"], March 11, 2009. On March 16, the army seized the presidential palace in the centre of Antananarivo. Ravalomanana was not in the palace at the time. He handed his resignation to the army, which then decided to hand over power to his fierce political rival, Andry Rajoelina. In 2019, an epidemic of measles killed 1,200 people.

In particular the absence of a communications code protecting press freedoms allows authorities to prosecute journalists under libel law and the criminal code whenever the content of their reporting offends the facto regime. In November 2012 the de facto minister of communications stated that assertions harming the \\"general interest\\" were banned from public media.

The de facto minister of communications targeted those who expressed dissent, sending official warning letters to news outlets whose coverage displeased the regime. From 2010 through 2012 an estimated 80 radio and television station licenses withdrawn and the stations ordered suspend broadcasting immediately. By the end of 2012 they had not been authorized to reopen. In September 2012 the editor of the national television station was suspended, reportedly for having opposition politicians on the air. Authorities also suspend journalists who continue to broadcast despite government warnings. To maintain access to sources and remain safe, journalists widely practiced self-censorship. On 2 May 2012, authorities imprisoned the editors of the private radio station Free FM, Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy and Fidel Razara Pierre, for a two-day investigation following a libel suit brought by Mamy Ravatomanga, a well-known backer of the de facto regime. Following a series of public rallies that same month marking the first anniversary of Free FM and calling for greater press freedom, the radio's editors were charged with provoking outrage against the regime, destruction of public goods, mounting opposition to security forces, and holding a public demonstration without authorization. On 22 July 2012, authorities closed the radio station, and the two journalists and another colleague went into hiding. By the end of 2012 Free FM remained closed. But after a deal consented with the two journalists and the regime, initiated by Mamy Ravatomanga, Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy is free and become the allied of the Rajoelina's regime. =Shortwave relay stations= In 2013, the government of Madagascar and Malagasy Global Business S.A. signed an agreement to operate the Madagascar relay station in Talata-Volonondry.

It was a subsidiary body of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), and was also assisted in its work by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNOHCHR). It was the UN's principal mechanism and international forum concerned with the promotion and protection of human rights. On 15 March 2006, the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to replace UNCHR with the UN Human Rights Council. History Eleanor Roosevelt at United Nations for Human Rights Commission meeting in Lake Success, New York in 1947 The UNCHR was established in 1946 by ECOSOC, and was one of the first two \\"Functional Commissions\\" set up within the early UN structure (the other being the Commission on the Status of Women). It was a body created under the terms of the United Nations Charter (specifically, under Article 68) to which all UN member states are signatories. It met for the first time in January 1947 and established a drafting committee for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations on December 10, 1948. The body went through two distinct phases. From 1947 to 1967, it concentrated on promoting human rights and helping states elaborate treaties, but not on investigating or condemning violators. It was a period of strict observance of the sovereignty principle. In 1967, the Commission adopted interventionism as its policy. The context of the decade was of Decolonization of Africa and Asia, and many countries of the continent pressed for a more active UN policy on human rights issues, especially in light of massive violations in apartheid South Africa. The new policy meant that the Commission would also investigate and produce reports on violations. To allow better fulfillment of this new policy, other changes took place. In the 1970s, the possibility of geographically-oriented workgroups was created. These groups would specialize their activities on the investigation of violations on a given region or even a single country, as was the case with Chile. With the 1980s came the creation of theme-oriented workgroups, which would specialize in specific types of abuses. None of these measures, however, were able to make the Commission as effective as desired, mainly because of the presence of human rights violators and the politicization of the body. During the following years until its extinction, the UNCHR became increasingly discredited among activists and governments alike. The Commission held its final meeting in Geneva on March 27, 2006 and was replaced by the United Nations Human Rights Council in the same year. Mandate The Commission on Human Rights was intended to examine, monitor and publicly report on human rights situations in specific countries or territories (known as country mechanisms or mandates) as well as on major phenomena of human rights violations worldwide (known as thematic mechanisms or mandates). The Human Rights division of the U.N. is also expected to uphold and protect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Structure At the time it was extinguished, the Commission consisted of representatives drawn from 53 member states, elected by the members of ECOSOC. There were no permanent members; each year (usually in May) approximately a third of the seats of the Commission would come up for election, and the representatives were appointed for a three-year term. Seats on the Commission were apportioned by region, using the mechanism of the United Nations Regional Groups. During its last year of service in 2005, the representation by region was as follows: * 15 from the African Group:  Burkina Faso, Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Kenya, Mauritania, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Togo, Zimbabwe * 12 from the Asian Group:  Bhutan, People's Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka * 5 from the Eastern European Group:  Armenia, Hungary, Romania, Russian Federation, Ukraine * 11 from the Latin American and Caribbean Group:  Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru * 10 from the Western European and Others Group:  Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States The Commission would meet each year in regular session for six weeks during March and April in Geneva, Switzerland. In January 2004, Australia was elected as chair of the 60th Session. In January 2005, Indonesia was elected chair of the 61st Session. Peru was elected chair of the 62nd Session in January 2006. The Commission held its final meeting in Geneva on March 27, 2006. Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights In 1999 the Economic and Social Council changed its title from the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights\\".Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, Retrieved 2010-04-19 The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights was the main subsidiary body of the Commission on Human Rights. It was composed of twenty-six experts whose responsibility was to undertake studies, particularly in light of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and make recommendations to the Commission concerning the prevention of discrimination of any kind relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and the protection of racial, national, religious and linguistic minorities. Membership was selected with regard to equitable geographical distribution. The Sub-Commission established seven Working Groups that investigate specific human rights concerns, including: * Minorities * Transnational corporations * Administration of justice * Anti-terrorism * Contemporary Forms of Slavery * Indigenous Populations * Communication * Social Forum The United Nations Human Rights Council assumed responsibility for the Sub-Commission when it replaced the Commission on Human Rights in 2006. Special procedures The Commission on Human Rights established 30 special procedures, or mechanisms, to address specific country situations or thematic issues such as freedom of expression and opinion, torture, the right to food, and the right to education. Individuals with expertise in particular areas of human rights were appointed by the chair of the Commission to serve as Special Rapporteurs for a maximum of six years. They are unpaid, independent experts who receive personnel and logistical support from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for their work. Their main activities are to examine, monitor, advise and publicly report on human rights situations in specific countries or territories. They are able to write to governments about reported violations and conduct fact-finding visits to countries that invite them. The special mechanisms are categorised according to: * Thematic Mandates.Thematic Mandates * Country Mandates.Country Mandates Special procedures also include working groups made up of up to five experts who monitor and investigate specific human rights concerns. Three groups were established by the Commission: * Working Group on Arbitrary Detention * Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances * Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination The special procedures are now under the direction of the United Nations Human Rights Council. Criticism The Commission was repeatedly criticized for the composition of its membership. In particular, several of its member countries themselves had dubious human rights records, including states whose representatives had been elected to chair the commission. Countries with records of human rights abuses like torture, extrajudicial killings, political imprisonment, and disappearances likely sought election to the Commission to project a positive international image. Commission membership also provided some political shelter from criticism of these abuses. Another criticism was that the Commission did not engage in constructive discussion of human rights issues, but was a forum for politically selective finger-pointing and criticism. The desire of states with problematic human rights records to be elected to the Commission was viewed largely as a way to defend themselves from such attacks. Activist groups had long expressed concern over the memberships of the People's Republic of China, Zimbabwe, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, and the past memberships of Algeria, Syria, Libya, Uganda and Vietnam on the Commission. These countries had extensive records of human rights violations, and one concern was that by working against resolutions on the commission condemning human rights violations, they indirectly promoted despotism and domestic repression. On May 4, 2004, United States ambassador Sichan Siv walked out of the Commission following the uncontested election of Sudan to the commission, calling it an \\"absurdity\\" in light of Sudan's ethnic cleansing in the Darfur region.Sudan keeps U.N. human rights post - World news - nbcnews.com One major consequence of the election of Sudan to the Commission was the lack of willingness for some countries to work through the commission. For example, July 30, 2004, it was the United Nations Security Council, not the Commission, that passed a resolution‚Äîby 13‚Äì0, with China and Pakistan abstaining‚Äîthreatening Sudan with unspecified sanctions if the situation in the Darfur region did not improve within the following 30 days. The reasons given for the action were the attacks by the Janjaweed Arab militias of Sudan on the non-Arab African Muslim population of Darfur, a region in western Sudan. The commission had also come under repeated criticism from the United States for its unwillingness to address other human rights concerns. In 2002, the United States was voted off the commission by the other member states, many of whom have been criticized for their human rights violations, and in 2003 Syria put forward a proposal to discuss US war crimes in Iraq. But journalist Anne Applebaum wrote, \\"the European Union and the United States aren't exempt from blame, either\\", citing their hesitance in voting to criticize Russia's actions in Chechnya. =Israel= The Commission was also criticized by advocates of Israel for bias against Israel. In 2002 Anne Bayefsky, a professor of international law at York University in Toronto, wrote that \\"commission members seek to avoid directly criticizing states with human rights problems, frequently by focusing on Israel, a state that, according to analysis of summary records, has for over 30 years occupied 15 percent of commission time and has been the subject of a third of country- specific resolutions\\".Anne Bayefsky: Ending Bias in the Human Rights System New York Times, May 22, 2002. On April 15, 2002, the Commission approved a resolution affirming the \\"legitimate right of the Palestinian people to resist the Israeli occupation in order to free its land and be able to exercise its right of self-determination\\".UN Commission on Human Rights, Resolution 2002/8 , UN Doc. E/CN.4/RES/2002/8, 15 April 2002. In so doing, the Palestinian people was declared \\"fulfilling its mission, one of the goals and purposes of the United Nations\\". Of the 53-member commission, 40 countries voted yes, five voted no, and seven abstained. Although widely reported that the resolution condoned resistance to Israel by \\"all available means, including armed struggle\\", the resolution itself does not contain those words.See e.g. Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, Including Palestine Commission on Human Rights, Fifty-eighth session, Agenda item 8. E/CN.4/2002/L.16. 9 April 2002. Alfred Moses, a former United States ambassador to the commission and now chairman of the monitoring group UN Watch, said that \\"A vote in favour of this resolution is a vote for Palestinian terrorism.\\"Steven Edwards: UN Backs Palestinian Violence Christian Action for Israel, April 16, 2002. In a letter to the UNHRC on November 15, 2002, following an attack by Palestinians on Israelis in the town of Hebron, Nabil Ramlawi, the permanent observer for Palestine at the U.N., appealed to the resolution as justification for the attack.Ed Morgan: Slaughterhouse-Six: Updating the Law of War, Part 2 of 2 German Law Journal, Vol. 5 No. 5‚Äì1 May 2004. Human rights and mental health In 1977, the commission formed a \\"Sub-Commission to study, with a view to formulating guidelines, if possible, the question of the protection of those detained on the grounds of mental ill- health against treatment that might adversely affect the human personality and its physical and intellectual integrity\\". The sub-commission was charged with \\"determin[ing] whether adequate grounds existed for detaining persons on the grounds of mental ill-health\\". The guidelines that resulted have been criticized for failing to protect the rights of involuntary patients.University of Wollongong - Faculty of Arts - STS Research Genocide The United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) passed a number of resolutions concerning genocide, these were: UNCHR Decision 9 (XXXV). 1986/18; 1987/25; 1988/28; 1989/16; 1990/19; \\"Fiftieth Anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide\\", 1998/10; and \\"Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide\\", 1999/67.Schabas, William (2000).

The commissions resolution was endorsed the UNCHR parent body the United Nations Economic and Social Council. * November 1992, the UNCHR \\"Call[ed] upon all States to consider the extent to which the acts committed in Bosnia ... and in Croatia constitute genocide in accordance with [the Genocide Convention]\\". * 1994, at the request of Canada an emergency meeting was convened to deal with the ongoing genocide in Rwanda. Ren√© Degni- Sgui was appointed as a Special Rapporteur, and he immediately visited Rwanda where he promptly issued a report on the scope of the genocide.

It lacks major propulsion or landing systems. Stations must have docking ports to allow other spacecraft to dock to transfer crew and supplies. The purpose of maintaining an orbital outpost varies depending on the program. Space stations have most often been launched for scientific purposes, but military launches have also occurred. As of , one fully operational and permanently inhabited space station is in low Earth orbit: the International Space Station (ISS), which is used to study the effects of long-term space flight on the human body as well as to provide a location to conduct a greater number and longer length of scientific studies than is possible on other space vehicles. China, India, Russia, and the U.S., as well as Bigelow Aerospace and Axiom Space, are all planning other stations for the coming decades.  History  Rotating wheel space station. Wernher von Braun 1952 concept The first mention of anything resembling a space station occurred in Edward Everett Hale's 1869 \\"The Brick Moon\\". The first to give serious, scientifically grounded consideration to space stations were Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Hermann Oberth about two decades apart in the early 20th century. In 1929 Herman Potoƒçnik's The Problem of Space Travel was published, the first to envision a \\"rotating wheel\\" space station to create artificial gravity. Conceptualized during the Second World War, the \\"sun gun\\" was a theoretical orbital weapon orbiting Earth at a height of . No further research was ever conducted. In 1951, Wernher von Braun published a concept for a rotating wheel space station in Collier's Weekly, referencing Potoƒçnik's idea. However, development of a rotating station was never begun in the 20th century. right During the latter half of the 20th century, the Soviet Union developed and launched the world's first space station, Salyut 1. The Almaz and Salyut series were eventually joined by Skylab, Mir, and Tiangong-1 and Tiangong-2. The hardware developed during the initial Soviet efforts remains in use, with evolved variants comprising a considerable part of the ISS, orbiting today. Each crew member stays aboard the station for weeks or months, but rarely more than a year. Starting with the ill-fated flight of the Soyuz 11 crew to Salyut 1, all recent human spaceflight duration records have been set aboard space stations. The duration record for a single spaceflight is 437.75 days, set by Valeri Polyakov aboard Mir from 1994 to 1995. , four cosmonauts have completed single missions of over a year, all aboard Mir. The last military-use space station was the Soviet Salyut 5, which was launched under the Almaz program and orbited between 1976 and 1977.Russian Space Stations (wikisource) =Early monolithic stations (1971‚Äì1986)= left Early stations were monolithic designs that were constructed and launched in one piece, generally containing all their supplies and experimental equipment. A crew would then be launched to join the station and perform research. After the supplies had been used up, the station was abandoned. The first space station was Salyut 1, which was launched by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1971. The earlier Soviet stations were all designated \\"Salyut\\", but among these there were two distinct types: civilian and military. The military stations, Salyut 2, Salyut 3, and Salyut 5, were also known as Almaz stations. The civilian stations Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 were built with two docking ports, which allowed a second crew to visit, bringing a new spacecraft with them; the Soyuz ferry could spend 90 days in space, at which point it needed to be replaced by a fresh Soyuz spacecraft. This allowed for a crew to man the station continually. The American Skylab (1973-1979) was also equipped with two docking ports, like second-generation stations, but the extra port was never utilized. The presence of a second port on the new stations allowed Progress supply vehicles to be docked to the station, meaning that fresh supplies could be brought to aid long-duration missions. This concept was expanded on Salyut 7, which \\"hard docked\\" with a TKS tug shortly before it was abandoned; this served as a proof-of-concept for the use of modular space stations. The later Salyuts may reasonably be seen as a transition between the two groups. = Mir (1986‚Äì2001) = Earth and the Mir station Unlike previous stations, the Soviet space station Mir had a modular design; a core unit was launched, and additional modules, generally with a specific role, were later added to that. This method allows for greater flexibility in operation, as well as removing the need for a single immensely powerful launch vehicle. Modular stations are also designed from the outset to have their supplies provided by logistical support craft, which allows for a longer lifetime at the cost of requiring regular support launches. Modules are still being developed based on the design and capabilities of Mir. = Tiangong program (2011‚Äì2019) = China's first space laboratory, Tiangong-1 was launched in September 2011. The uncrewed Shenzhou 8 then successfully performed an automatic rendezvous and docking in November 2011. The crewed Shenzhou 9 then docked with Tiangong-1 in June 2012, the crewed Shenzhou 10 in 2013. A second space laboratory Tiangong-2 was launched in September 2016, while a plan for Tiangong-3 was merged with Tiangong-2. In May 2017, China informed the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs that Tiangong-1's altitude was decaying and that it would soon reenter the atmosphere and break up. The reentry was projected to occur in late March or early April 2018. According to the China Manned Space Engineering Office, Tiangong-1 reentered over the South Pacific Ocean, northwest of Tahiti, on 2 April 2018 at 00:15 UTC. In July 2019 the China Manned Space Engineering Office announced that it was planning to deorbit Tiangong-2 in the near future, but no specific date was given. The station subsequently made a controlled reentry on 19 July and burned up over the South Pacific Ocean. Current =ISS (1998‚Äìpresent)= International Space Station under construction The ISS is divided into two main sections, the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) and the US Orbital Segment (USOS). The first module of the International Space Station, Zarya, was launched in 1998. The Russian Orbital Segment's \\"second-generation\\" modules were able to launch on Proton, fly to the correct orbit, and dock themselves without human intervention. Connections are automatically made for power, data, gases, and propellants. The Russian autonomous approach allows the assembly of space stations prior to the launch of crew. The Russian \\"second-generation\\" modules are able to be reconfigured to suit changing needs. As of 2009, RKK Energia was considering the removal and reuse of some modules of the ROS on the Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex after the end of mission is reached for the ISS. However, in September 2017 the head of Roscosmos said that the technical feasibility of separating the station to form OPSEK had been studied, and there were now no plans to separate the Russian segment from the ISS. In contrast, the main US modules launched on the Space Shuttle and were attached to the ISS by crews during EVAs. Connections for electrical power, data, propulsion, and cooling fluids are also made at this time, resulting in an integrated block of modules that is not designed for disassembly and must be deorbited as one mass. The Axiom Orbital Segment is a planned commercial segment to be added to the ISS starting in the mid 2020s. Axiom Space gained NASA approval for the venture in January 2020. Up to three Axiom modules will attach to the International Space Station. The first module could be launched no later than 2024 and will docked to the forward port of Harmony, requiring relocation of the of PMA-2. Axiom Space plans to attach up to two additional modules to its first core module, and send private astronauts to inhabit the modules. The modules could one day detach into the Axiom Station in a similar matter to Russia's proposed OPSEK. =Lunar Gateway (under development)= The Lunar Gateway is a future international space station intended to serve as a science platform and as a staging area for the lunar landings of NASA's Artemis program and follow-on human mission to Mars. The Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) started development during the now canceled Asteroid Redirect Mission. It was envisioned as a robotic, high performance solar electric spacecraft that would retrieve a multi-ton boulder from an asteroid and bring it to lunar orbit for study. When ARM was canceled, the concept was repurposed as the Gateway propulsion system. In May 2019, the PPE manufacturing contract was awarded.  Planned projects  * : As of 2018, construction of the Chinese large modular space station was scheduled to begin in 2019 to receive crews by 2022. * : Bigelow Aerospace is developing the Bigelow Commercial Space Station using the B330 expandable spacecraft module and other modules. On 8 April 2016, a smaller scale Bigelow Expandable Activity Module was launched to the International Space Station to test expandable habitat technology in situ. * : As of 2019, India is planning to begin flying the crewed Gaganyaan spacecraft by 2021. The spacecraft is intended to be upgraded to perform rendezvous and docking after a first flight, with a 20 tonne space station intended to be built in the next 5‚Äì7 years.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-space-station-likely- to-have-space-for-three/articleshow/71828669.cms *: As of 2015, the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space plans to build the Indonesian Space Station (SLARI) which is used as a means of national defense. The initial launch of the project is targeted at 2030‚Äì2035. * : Starting in 2015, NASA was developing Deep Space Habitats (DSH) under the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) for Beyond Earth Orbit (BEO) spacestations and transfer vehicles, on which the from 2023 onward planned Lunar Gateway is based. With international cooperation similar to the US Orbital Segment (USOS), the Lunar Gateway might include Russian participation. * : Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex * : Lunar Orbital Station * : NanoRacks, after finalizing its contract with NASA and winning NextSTEPs Phase II award, is now developing its concept Independence-1 (previously known as Ixion), which would be a wet workshop design to be tested in space. * : Axiom International Commercial Space Station: Axiom and a team of companies won NASA's NextSTEP award to develop a node module to add to the International Space Station by the second half of 2024, which Axiom plans to follow with two additional modules and a power and thermal module that will eventually allow the set of modules to detach from the ISS (about a year before ISS's end of life) and continuously operate as a stand-alone space station. The NASA award was under Appendix I of the NextSTEP program, \\"which offered private industry use of the station utilities and a port to attach one or more commercial elements to the orbiting laboratory.\\"  Architecture  Astronauts peer out of Destiny Laboratory, 2001 Two types of space stations have been flown: monolithic and modular. Monolithic stations consist of a single vehicle and are launched by one rocket. Modular stations consist of two or more separate vehicles that are launched independently and docked on orbit. Modular stations are currently preferred due to lower costs and greater flexibility. Both types can be refueled by cargo craft, such as Progress. A space station is a complex vehicle that must incorporate many interrelated subsystems, including structure, electrical power, thermal control, attitude determination and control, orbital navigation and propulsion, automation and robotics, computing and communications, environmental and life support, crew facilities, and crew and cargo transportation. Stations must serve a useful role, which drives the capabilities required. =Materials= Space stations are often made from durable materials that have to weather space radiation, internal pressure, micrometeoroids, and thermal effects of the sun and cold temperatures for very long periods of time. They are typically made from stainless steel, titanium and high-quality aluminum alloys, with layers of insulation such as Kevlar as a ballistics shield protection.http://en.roscosmos.ru/202/ =Habitability= Advanced plant habitat on the International Space Station The space station environment presents a variety of challenges to human habitability, including short-term problems such as the limited supplies of air, water and food and the need to manage waste heat, and long-term ones such as weightlessness and relatively high levels of ionizing radiation. These conditions can create long-term health problems for space-station inhabitants, including muscle atrophy, bone deterioration, balance disorders, eyesight disorders, and elevated risk of cancer. Future space habitats may attempt to address these issues, and could be designed for occupation beyond the weeks or months that current missions typically last. Possible solutions include the creation of artificial gravity by a rotating structure, the inclusion of radiation shielding, and the development of on-site agricultural ecosystems. Some designs might even accommodate large numbers of people, becoming essentially \\"cities in space\\" where people would reside semi-permanently. For now, no space station suitable for long-term human residence has ever been built, since the current launch costs for even a small station are not economically or politically viable. =Environmental microbiology= Molds that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal, glass and rubber. Despite an expanding array of molecular approaches for detecting microorganisms, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of the microbial cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive.  List of space stations  The Soviet space stations came in two types, the civilian Durable Orbital Station (DOS), and the military Almaz stations. Dates refer to periods when stations were inhabited by crews. * Salyut space stations 1971‚Äì1986 () : Salyut 1: 1971, 1 crew and 1 failed crew docking  DOS-2: 1972, launch failure  Salyut 2/Almaz: 1973, failed shortly after launch  Kosmos 557: 1973, failed to achieve orbit, re-entered eleven days after launch  Salyut 3/Almaz: 1974, 1 crew and 1 failed crew docking  Salyut 4: 1975, 2 crews and 1 planned crew  Salyut 5/Almaz: 1976‚Äì1977, 2 crews and 1 failed crew docking  Salyut 6: 1977‚Äì1981, 16 crews (5 long duration, 11 short duration) and 1 failed crew docking  Salyut 7: 1982‚Äì1986, 10 crews (6 long duration, 4 short duration) and 1 failed crew docking * Skylab (): 1973‚Äì1979, 3 crews * Mir (/): 1986‚Äì2000, 28 long duration crews * International Space Station (ISS) (, , , and ): 2000‚Äìongoing, 63 Expedition crews (as of June 2020) * Tiangong program (): 2011‚Äìongoing  Tiangong-1: 2011‚Äì2018, 2 crews  Tiangong-2: 2016‚Äì2019, 1 crew, 1 uncrewed resupply vessel =Canceled projects= 1967 conceptual drawing of Gemini B reentry module separating from the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) * : USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) project was an explicitly military project that was canceled in 1969, about a year before the first planned test flight. * : Skylab B was manufactured as a backup article; due to the high costs of Saturn launches and a desire by NASA to move entirely to STS operations it was never flown.

The project was canceled when Space Industries Incorporated was unable to secure funding from the United States government. * : The European Columbus project planned to launch a small space station serviced by the Hermes shuttle. It evolved into the ISS Columbus module. * : Excalibur Almaz was developing a reusable space vehicle and a space station based on \\"Almaz\\" technology for flight in the early 2010s. In March 2016, plans were announced to have the equipment converted into an educational exhibit, owing to lack of funds. * : In December 2011 Boeing proposed an Exploration Gateway Platform to be constructed at the ISS and relocated via space tug to an Earth-Moon Lagrange point (EML-1 or 2). The purpose of the platform would be to serve as a propellant depot and to support lunar landing missions.  In fiction  Space stations, sometimes referred to as star bases, are a common trope in science fiction. Notable works they appear in include TV shows Babylon 5 and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, among others. Typically they act as drydocks, battle stations or trading outposts.

The original image is high-pass filtered, yielding the three detail coefficients subimages (top right: horizontal, bottom left: vertical, and bottom right: diagonal). It is then low-pass filtered and downscaled, yielding an approximation coefficients subimage (top left); the filtering process is repeated once again on this approximation image. In mathematics, the Haar wavelet is a sequence of rescaled \\"square-shaped\\" functions which together form a wavelet family or basis. Wavelet analysis is similar to Fourier analysis in that it allows a target function over an interval to be represented in terms of an orthonormal basis. The Haar sequence is now recognised as the first known wavelet basis and extensively used as a teaching example. The Haar sequence was proposed in 1909 by Alfr√©d Haar.see p. 361 in . Haar used these functions to give an example of an orthonormal system for the space of square-integrable functions on the unit interval [0, 1]. The study of wavelets, and even the term \\"wavelet\\", did not come until much later. As a special case of the Daubechies wavelet, the Haar wavelet is also known as Db1. The Haar wavelet is also the simplest possible wavelet. The technical disadvantage of the Haar wavelet is that it is not continuous, and therefore not differentiable. This property can, however, be an advantage for the analysis of signals with sudden transitions, such as monitoring of tool failure in machines. The Haar wavelet's mother wavelet function \\\\psi(t) can be described as : \\\\psi(t) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 \\\\quad & 0 \\\\leq t < \\\\frac{1}{2},\\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\leq t < 1,\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &\\\\mbox{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} Its scaling function \\\\varphi(t) can be described as : \\\\varphi(t) = \\\\begin{cases}1 \\\\quad & 0 \\\\leq t < 1,\\\\\\\\\\\\0 &\\\\mbox{otherwise.}\\\\end{cases}  Haar functions and Haar system  For every pair n, k of integers in Z, the Haar function œàn, k is defined on the real line R by the formula : \\\\psi_{n,k}(t) = 2^{n / 2} \\\\psi(2^n t-k), \\\\quad t \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}. This function is supported on the right-open interval , i.e., it vanishes outside that interval. It has integral 0 and norm 1 in the Hilbert space L2(R), : \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}} \\\\psi_{n, k}(t) \\\\, d t = 0, \\\\quad \\\\\\\\psi_{n, k}\\\\^2_{L^2(\\\\mathbf{R})} = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}} \\\\psi_{n, k}(t)^2 \\\\, d t = 1. The Haar functions are pairwise orthogonal, : \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}} \\\\psi_{n_1, k_1}(t) \\\\psi_{n_2, k_2}(t) \\\\, d t = \\\\delta_{n_1, n_2} \\\\delta_{k_1, k_2}, where Œ¥i,j represents the Kronecker delta. Here is the reason for orthogonality: when the two supporting intervals I_{n_1, k_1} and I_{n_2, k_2} are not equal, then they are either disjoint, or else, the smaller of the two supports, say I_{n_1, k_1}, is contained in the lower or in the upper half of the other interval, on which the function \\\\psi_{n_2, k_2} remains constant. It follows in this case that the product of these two Haar functions is a multiple of the first Haar function, hence the product has integral 0\\\\. The Haar system on the real line is the set of functions :\\\\\\\\{ \\\\psi_{n,k}(t) \\\\; ; \\\\; n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}, \\\\; k \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\\\\\}. It is complete in L2(R): The Haar system on the line is an orthonormal basis in L2(R). Haar wavelet properties The Haar wavelet has several notable properties: #Any continuous real function with compact support can be approximated uniformly by linear combinations of \\\\varphi(t),\\\\varphi(2t),\\\\varphi(4t),\\\\dots,\\\\varphi(2^n t),\\\\dots and their shifted functions. This extends to those function spaces where any function therein can be approximated by continuous functions. #Any continuous real function on [0, 1] can be approximated uniformly on [0, 1] by linear combinations of the constant function 1, \\\\psi(t),\\\\psi(2t),\\\\psi(4t),\\\\dots,\\\\psi(2^n t),\\\\dots and their shifted functions.As opposed to the preceding statement, this fact is not obvious: see p. 363 in . #Orthogonality in the form \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}2^{(n+n_1)/2}\\\\psi(2^n t-k)\\\\psi(2^{n_1} t - k_1)\\\\, dt = \\\\delta_{n,n_1}\\\\delta_{k,k_1}. Here Œ¥i,j represents the Kronecker delta. The dual function of œà(t) is œà(t) itself. # Wavelet/scaling functions with different scale n have a functional relationship: since :: \\\\begin{align} \\\\varphi(t) &= \\\\varphi(2t)+\\\\varphi(2t-1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[.2em] \\\\psi(t) &= \\\\varphi(2t)-\\\\varphi(2t-1), \\\\end{align} :it follows that coefficients of scale n can be calculated by coefficients of scale n+1: :If \\\\chi_w(k, n)= 2^{n/2}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)\\\\varphi(2^nt-k)\\\\, dt :and \\\\Chi_w(k, n)= 2^{n/2}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)\\\\psi(2^nt-k)\\\\, dt :then :: \\\\chi_w(k,n)= 2^{-1/2} \\\\bigl( \\\\chi_w(2k,n+1)+\\\\chi_w(2k+1,n+1) \\\\bigr) :: \\\\Chi_w(k,n)= 2^{-1/2} \\\\bigl( \\\\chi_w(2k,n+1)-\\\\chi_w(2k+1,n+1) \\\\bigr).  Haar system on the unit interval and related systems  In this section, the discussion is restricted to the unit interval [0, 1] and to the Haar functions that are supported on [0, 1]. The system of functions considered by Haar in 1910,p. 361 in called the Haar system on [0, 1] in this article, consists of the subset of Haar wavelets defined as :\\\\\\\\{ t \\\\in [0, 1] \\\\mapsto \\\\psi_{n,k}(t) \\\\; ; \\\\; n \\\\in \\\\N \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}, \\\\; 0 \\\\leq k < 2^n\\\\\\\\}, with the addition of the constant function 1 on [0, 1]. In Hilbert space terms, this Haar system on [0, 1] is a complete orthonormal system, i.e., an orthonormal basis, for the space L2([0, 1]) of square integrable functions on the unit interval. The Haar system on [0, 1] with the constant function 1 as first element, followed with the Haar functions ordered according to the lexicographic ordering of couples  is further a monotone Schauder basis for the space Lp([0, 1]) when .see p. 3 in J. Lindenstrauss, L. Tzafriri, (1977), \\"Classical Banach Spaces I, Sequence Spaces\\", Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete 92, Berlin: Springer-Verlag, . This basis is unconditional when .The result is due to R. E. Paley, A remarkable series of orthogonal functions (I), Proc. London Math. Soc. 34 (1931) pp. 241-264. See also p. 155 in J. Lindenstrauss, L. Tzafriri, (1979), \\"Classical Banach spaces II, Function spaces\\". Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete 97, Berlin: Springer-Verlag, . There is a related Rademacher system consisting of sums of Haar functions, :r_n(t) = 2^{-n/2} \\\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n - 1} \\\\psi_{n, k}(t), \\\\quad t \\\\in [0, 1], \\\\ n \\\\ge 0. Notice that rn(t)= 1 on [0, 1). This is an orthonormal system but it is not complete. In the language of probability theory, the Rademacher sequence is an instance of a sequence of independent Bernoulli random variables with mean 0\\\\. The Khintchine inequality expresses the fact that in all the spaces Lp([0, 1]), , the Rademacher sequence is equivalent to the unit vector basis in ‚Ñì2.see for example p. 66 in J. Lindenstrauss, L. Tzafriri, (1977), \\"Classical Banach Spaces I, Sequence Spaces\\", Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete 92, Berlin: Springer-Verlag, . In particular, the closed linear span of the Rademacher sequence in Lp([0, 1]), , is isomorphic to ‚Ñì2. = The Faber-Schauder system = The Faber-Schauder systemFaber, Georg (1910), \\"√úber die Orthogonalfunktionen des Herrn Haar\\", Deutsche Math.-Ver (in German) 19: 104-112\\\\. ; http://www-gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/cgi- bin/digbib.cgi?PPN37721857X ; http://resolver.sub.uni- goettingen.de/purl?GDZPPN002122553Schauder, Juliusz (1928), \\"Eine Eigenschaft des Haarschen Orthogonalsystems\\", Mathematische Zeitschrift 28: 317-320. is the family of continuous functions on [0, 1] consisting of the constant function 1, and of multiples of indefinite integrals of the functions in the Haar system on [0, 1], chosen to have norm 1 in the maximum norm. This system begins with s0 = 1, then is the indefinite integral vanishing at 0 of the function 1, first element of the Haar system on [0, 1]. Next, for every integer , functions are defined by the formula : s_{n, k}(t) = 2^{1 + n/2} \\\\int_0^t \\\\psi_{n, k}(u) \\\\, d u, \\\\quad t \\\\in [0, 1], \\\\ 0 \\\\le k < 2^n. These functions are continuous, piecewise linear, supported by the interval that also supports . The function is equal to 1 at the midpoint of the interval , linear on both halves of that interval. It takes values between 0 and 1 everywhere. The Faber-Schauder system is a Schauder basis for the space C([0, 1]) of continuous functions on [0, 1]. For every f in C([0, 1]), the partial sum : f_{n+1} = a_0 s_0 + a_1 s_1 + \\\\sum_{m = 0}^{n-1} \\\\Bigl( \\\\sum_{k=0}^{2^m - 1} a_{m,k} s_{m, k} \\\\Bigr) \\\\in C([0, 1]) of the series expansion of f in the Faber-Schauder system is the continuous piecewise linear function that agrees with f at the points , where . Next, the formula : f_{n+2} - f_{n+1} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n - 1} \\\\bigl( f(x_{n,k}) - f_{n+1}(x_{n, k}) \\\\bigr) s_{n, k} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n - 1} a_{n, k} s_{n, k} gives a way to compute the expansion of f step by step. Since f is uniformly continuous, the sequence {fn} converges uniformly to f. It follows that the Faber-Schauder series expansion of f converges in C([0, 1]), and the sum of this series is equal to f. = The Franklin system = The Franklin system is obtained from the Faber-Schauder system by the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization procedure.see Z. Ciesielski, Properties of the orthonormal Franklin system. Studia Math. 23 1963 141‚Äì157.Franklin system. B.I. Golubov (originator), Encyclopedia of Mathematics. URL: http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=Franklin_system&oldid;=16655 Since the Franklin system has the same linear span as that of the Faber- Schauder system, this span is dense in C([0, 1]), hence in L2([0, 1]). The Franklin system is therefore an orthonormal basis for L2([0, 1]), consisting of continuous piecewise linear functions. P. Franklin proved in 1928 that this system is a Schauder basis for C([0, 1]).Philip Franklin, A set of continuous orthogonal functions, Math. Ann. 100 (1928), 522-529. The Franklin system is also an unconditional Schauder basis for the space Lp([0, 1]) when .S. V. Boƒçkarev, Existence of a basis in the space of functions analytic in the disc, and some properties of Franklin's system. Mat. Sb. 95 (1974), 3‚Äì18 (Russian). Translated in Math. USSR-Sb. 24 (1974), 1‚Äì16. The Franklin system provides a Schauder basis in the disk algebra A(D). This was proved in 1974 by Boƒçkarev, after the existence of a basis for the disk algebra had remained open for more than forty years.The question appears p. 238, ¬ß3 in Banach's book, . The disk algebra A(D) appears as Example 10, p. 12 in Banach's book. Boƒçkarev's construction of a Schauder basis in A(D) goes as follows: let f be a complex valued Lipschitz function on [0, œÄ]; then f is the sum of a cosine series with absolutely summable coefficients. Let T(f) be the element of A(D) defined by the complex power series with the same coefficients, : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ f : x \\\\in [0, \\\\pi] \\\\rightarrow \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n \\\\cos(n x) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\longrightarrow \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ T(f) : z \\\\rightarrow \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n z^n, \\\\quad z\\\\le 1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Boƒçkarev's basis for A(D) is formed by the images under T of the functions in the Franklin system on [0, œÄ]. Boƒçkarev's equivalent description for the mapping T starts by extending f to an even Lipschitz function g1 on [‚àíœÄ, œÄ], identified with a Lipschitz function on the unit circle T. Next, let g2 be the conjugate function of g1, and define T(f) to be the function in A(D) whose value on the boundary T of D is equal to . When dealing with 1-periodic continuous functions, or rather with continuous functions f on [0, 1] such that , one removes the function from the Faber-Schauder system, in order to obtain the periodic Faber-Schauder system. The periodic Franklin system is obtained by orthonormalization from the periodic FaberSchauder system.See p. 161, III.D.20 and p. 192, III.E.17 in One can prove Boƒçkarev's result on A(D) by proving that the periodic Franklin system on [0, 2œÄ] is a basis for a Banach space Ar isomorphic to A(D). The space Ar consists of complex continuous functions on the unit circle T whose conjugate function is also continuous. Haar matrix The 2√ó2 Haar matrix that is associated with the Haar wavelet is : H_2 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. Using the discrete wavelet transform, one can transform any sequence (a_0,a_1,\\\\dots,a_{2n},a_{2n+1}) of even length into a sequence of two- component-vectors \\\\left(\\\\left(a_0,a_1\\\\right),\\\\dots,\\\\left(a_{2n},a_{2n+1}\\\\right)\\\\right) . If one right-multiplies each vector with the matrix H_2 , one gets the result \\\\left(\\\\left(s_0,d_0\\\\right),\\\\dots,\\\\left(s_n,d_n\\\\right)\\\\right) of one stage of the fast Haar-wavelet transform. Usually one separates the sequences s and d and continues with transforming the sequence s. Sequence s is often referred to as the averages part, whereas d is known as the details part. If one has a sequence of length a multiple of four, one can build blocks of 4 elements and transform them in a similar manner with the 4√ó4 Haar matrix : H_4 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, which combines two stages of the fast Haar-wavelet transform. Compare with a Walsh matrix, which is a non-localized 1/‚Äì1 matrix. Generally, the 2N√ó2N Haar matrix can be derived by the following equation. : H_{2N} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} H_{N} \\\\otimes [1, 1] \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_{N} \\\\otimes [1, -1] \\\\end{bmatrix} :where I_{N} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & \\\\dots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} and \\\\otimes is the Kronecker product. The Kronecker product of A \\\\otimes B, where A is an m√ón matrix and B is a p√óq matrix, is expressed as : A \\\\otimes B = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11}B & \\\\dots & a_{1n}B \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{m1}B & \\\\dots & a_{mn}B\\\\end{bmatrix}. An un-normalized 8-point Haar matrix H_8 is shown below : H_{8} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&1&1&1&1&1&1&1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&1&1&1&-1&-1&-1&-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&1&-1&-1&0&0&0&0& \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&0&0&1&1&-1&-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&-1&0&0&0&0&0&0& \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&1&-1&0&0&0&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&0&0&1&-1&0&0& \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&0&1&-1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. Note that, the above matrix is an un- normalized Haar matrix. The Haar matrix required by the Haar transform should be normalized. From the definition of the Haar matrix H, one can observe that, unlike the Fourier transform, H has only real elements (i.e., 1, -1 or 0) and is non-symmetric. Take the 8-point Haar matrix H_8 as an example. The first row of H_8 measures the average value, and the second row of H_8 measures a low frequency component of the input vector. The next two rows are sensitive to the first and second half of the input vector respectively, which corresponds to moderate frequency components. The remaining four rows are sensitive to the four section of the input vector, which corresponds to high frequency components. Haar transform The Haar transform is the simplest of the wavelet transforms. This transform cross-multiplies a function against the Haar wavelet with various shifts and stretches, like the Fourier transform cross-multiplies a function against a sine wave with two phases and many stretches.The Haar Transform = Introduction = The Haar transform is one of the oldest transform functions, proposed in 1910 by the Hungarian mathematician Alfr√©d Haar. It is found effective in applications such as signal and image compression in electrical and computer engineering as it provides a simple and computationally efficient approach for analysing the local aspects of a signal. The Haar transform is derived from the Haar matrix. An example of a 4x4 Haar transformation matrix is shown below. :H_4 = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sqrt{2} & -\\\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\sqrt{2} & -\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\end{bmatrix} The Haar transform can be thought of as a sampling process in which rows of the transformation matrix act as samples of finer and finer resolution. Compare with the Walsh transform, which is also 1/‚Äì1, but is non-localized. = Property = The Haar transform has the following properties : 1. No need for multiplications. It requires only additions and there are many elements with zero value in the Haar matrix, so the computation time is short. It is faster than Walsh transform, whose matrix is composed of +1 and ‚àí1. : 2. Input and output length are the same. However, the length should be a power of 2, i.e. N = 2^k, k\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}. : 3. It can be used to analyse the localized feature of signals. Due to the orthogonal property of the Haar function, the frequency components of input signal can be analyzed. = Haar transform and Inverse Haar transform = The Haar transform yn of an n-input function xn is : y_n = H_n x_n The Haar transform matrix is real and orthogonal. Thus, the inverse Haar transform can be derived by the following equations. : H = H^*, H^{-1} = H^T, \\\\text{ i.e. } HH^T = I : where I is the identity matrix. For example, when n = 4 : H_4^{T}H_4 = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&1&\\\\sqrt{2}&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&1&-\\\\sqrt{2}&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&-1&0&\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&-1&0&-\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\cdot\\\\; \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&1&1&1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&1&-1&-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sqrt{2}&-\\\\sqrt{2}&0&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&\\\\sqrt{2}&-\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&1&0&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&1&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&0&1 \\\\end{bmatrix} Thus, the inverse Haar transform is : x_{n} = H^{T}y_{n} = Example = The Haar transform coefficients of a n=4-point signal x_{4} = [1,2,3,4]^{T} can be found as : y_{4} = H_4 x_4 = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&1&1&1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&1&-1&-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sqrt{2}&-\\\\sqrt{2}&0&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&\\\\sqrt{2}&-\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1/\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1/\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\end{bmatrix} The input signal can then be perfectly reconstructed by the inverse Haar transform : \\\\hat{x_{4}} = H_{4}^{T}y_{4} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&1&\\\\sqrt{2}&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&1&-\\\\sqrt{2}&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&-1&0&\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&-1&0&-\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1/\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1/\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 \\\\end{bmatrix} = Application = Modern cameras are capable of producing images with resolutions in the range of tens of megapixels. These images need to be compressed before storage and transfer. The Haar transform can be used for image compression. The basic idea is to transfer the image into a matrix in which each element of the matrix represents a pixel in the image. For example, a 256√ó256 matrix is saved for a 256√ó256 image. JPEG image compression involves cutting the original image into 8√ó8 sub-images. Each sub-image is an 8√ó8 matrix. The 2-D Haar transform is required. The equation of the Haar transform is B_n = H_n A_n H_n^T, where A_n is a n √ó n matrix and H_n is n-point Haar transform. The inverse Haar transform is A_n = H_n^T B_n H_n See also * Dimension reduction * Walsh matrix * Walsh transform * Wavelet * Signal * Haar-like feature * Str√∂mberg wavelet * Dyadic transformation Notes References  Charles K.

Such transformations map a function to a set of coefficients of basis functions, where the basis functions are sinusoidal and are therefore strongly localized in the frequency spectrum. (These transforms are generally designed to be invertible.) In the case of the Fourier transform, each basis function corresponds to a single frequency component. Continuous transforms Applied to functions of continuous arguments, Fourier-related transforms include: * Two-sided Laplace transform * Mellin transform, another closely related integral transform * Laplace transform * Fourier transform, with special cases:  Fourier series * When the input function/waveform is periodic, the Fourier transform output is a Dirac comb function, modulated by a discrete sequence of finite-valued coefficients that are complex-valued in general. These are called Fourier series coefficients. The term Fourier series actually refers to the inverse Fourier transform, which is a sum of sinusoids at discrete frequencies, weighted by the Fourier series coefficients. * When the non-zero portion of the input function has finite duration, the Fourier transform is continuous and finite-valued. But a discrete subset of its values is sufficient to reconstruct/represent the portion that was analyzed. The same discrete set is obtained by treating the duration of the segment as one period of a periodic function and computing the Fourier series coefficients.  Sine and cosine transforms: When the input function has odd or even symmetry around the origin, the Fourier transform reduces to a sine or cosine transform. * Hartley transform * Short-time Fourier transform (or short-term Fourier transform) (STFT)  Rectangular mask short-time Fourier transform * Chirplet transform * Fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) * Hankel transform: related to the Fourier Transform of radial functions. * Fourier‚ÄìBros‚ÄìIagolnitzer transform * Linear canonical transform Discrete transforms For usage on computers, number theory and algebra, discrete arguments (e.g. functions of a series of discrete samples) are often more appropriate, and are handled by the transforms (analogous to the continuous cases above): * Discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT): Equivalent to the Fourier transform of a \\"continuous\\" function that is constructed from the discrete input function by using the sample values to modulate a Dirac comb. When the sample values are derived by sampling a function on the real line, ∆í(x), the DTFT is equivalent to a periodic summation of the Fourier transform of ∆í. The DTFT output is always periodic (cyclic). An alternative viewpoint is that the DTFT is a transform to a frequency domain that is bounded (or finite), the length of one cycle.  discrete Fourier transform (DFT): * When the input sequence is periodic, the DTFT output is also a Dirac comb function, modulated by the coefficients of a Fourier seriesThe Fourier series represents \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}f(nT)\\\\cdot \\\\delta(t-nT), where T is the interval between samples. which can be computed as a DFT of one cycle of the input sequence. The number of discrete values in one cycle of the DFT is the same as in one cycle of the input sequence. * When the non-zero portion of the input sequence has finite duration, the DTFT is continuous and finite-valued. But a discrete subset of its values is sufficient to reconstruct/represent the portion that was analyzed. The same discrete set is obtained by treating the duration of the segment as one cycle of a periodic function and computing the DFT.  Discrete sine and cosine transforms: When the input sequence has odd or even symmetry around the origin, the DTFT reduces to a discrete sine transform (DST) or discrete cosine transform (DCT). * Regressive discrete Fourier series, in which the period is determined by the data rather than fixed in advance.  Discrete Chebyshev transforms (on the 'roots' grid and the 'extrema' grid of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind). This transform is of much importance in the field of spectral methods for solving differential equations because it can be used to swiftly and efficient go from grid point values to Chebyshev series coefficients. * Generalized DFT (GDFT), a generalization of the DFT and constant modulus transforms where phase functions might be of linear with integer and real valued slopes, or even non- linear phase bringing flexibilities for optimal designs of various metrics, e.g. auto- and cross-correlations. * Discrete-space Fourier transform (DSFT) is the generalization of the DTFT from 1D signals to 2D signals. It is called \\"discrete-space\\" rather than \\"discrete-time\\" because the most prevalent application is to imaging and image processing where the input function arguments are equally spaced samples of spatial coordinates (x,y). The DSFT output is periodic in both variables. * Z-transform, a generalization of the DTFT to the entire complex plane * Modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) * Discrete Hartley transform (DHT) * Also the discretized STFT (see above). * Hadamard transform (Walsh function). * Fourier transform on finite groups. * Discrete Fourier transform (general). The use of all of these transforms is greatly facilitated by the existence of efficient algorithms based on a fast Fourier transform (FFT). The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is critical for understanding the output of such discrete transforms.

The transformation is typically lossless (perfectly reversible) on its own but is used to enable better (more targeted) quantization, which then results in a lower quality copy of the original input (lossy compression). In transform coding, knowledge of the application is used to choose information to discard, thereby lowering its bandwidth. The remaining information can then be compressed via a variety of methods. When the output is decoded, the result may not be identical to the original input, but is expected to be close enough for the purpose of the application. Colour television = NTSC = One of the most successful transform encoding system is typically not referred to as such‚Äîthe example being NTSC color television. After an extensive series of studies in the 1950s, Alda Bedford showed that the human eye has high resolution only for black and white, somewhat less for \\"mid-range\\" colors like yellows and greens, and much less for colors on the end of the spectrum, reds and blues. Using this knowledge allowed RCA to develop a system in which they discarded most of the blue signal after it comes from the camera, keeping most of the green and only some of the red; this is chroma subsampling in the YIQ color space. The result is a signal with considerably less content, one that would fit within existing 6 MHz black-and-white signals as a phase modulated differential signal. The average TV displays the equivalent of 350 pixels on a line, but the TV signal contains enough information for only about 50 pixels of blue and perhaps 150 of red. This is not apparent to the viewer in most cases, as the eye makes little use of the \\"missing\\" information anyway. = PAL and SECAM = The PAL and SECAM systems use nearly identical or very similar methods to transmit colour. In any case both systems are subsampled. Digital The term is much more commonly used in digital media and digital signal processing. The most widely used transform coding technique in this regard is the discrete cosine transform (DCT), proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972, and presented by Ahmed with T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974. This DCT, in the context of the family of discrete cosine transforms, is the DCT-II. It is the basis for the common JPEG image compression standard, which examines small blocks of the image and transforms them to the frequency domain for more efficient quantization (lossy) and data compression. In video coding, the H.26x and MPEG standards modify this DCT image compression technique across frames in a motion image using motion compensation, further reducing the size compared to a series of JPEGs. In audio coding, MPEG audio compression analyzes the transformed data according to a psychoacoustic model that describes the human ear's sensitivity to parts of the signal, similar to the TV model. MP3 uses a hybrid coding algorithm, combining the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) and fast Fourier transform (FFT). It was succeeded by Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), which uses a pure MDCT algorithm to significantly improve compression efficiency. The basic process of digitizing an analog signal is a kind of transform coding that uses sampling in one or more domains as its transform.

In addition to his writing, Williams had a long career as a physician practicing both pediatrics and general medicine. He was affiliated with Passaic General Hospital, where he served as the hospital's chief of pediatrics from 1924 until his death. The hospital, which is now known as St. Mary's General Hospital, paid tribute to Williams with a memorial plaque that states \\"We walk the wards that Williams walked\\". Life and career Williams was born in Rutherford, New Jersey in 1883. His father was born in England but raised (ages 5-31) in the Dominican Republic; his mother was from Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico and had French extraction. Scholars note that the Caribbean culture of the family home had an important influence on Williams. Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera observes, \\"English was not his primary means of communication until he was a teenager. At home his mother and father‚Äîwho were raised in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, respectively‚Äîspoke Spanish with each other and to young William Carlos.‚Äù While he wrote in English, ‚Äúthe poet‚Äôs first language‚Äù was Spanish and his ‚Äúconsciousness and social orientation‚Äù were shaped by Caribbean customs; his life was influenced ‚Äúto a very important degree by a plural cultural foundation.\\" Williams received his primary and secondary education in Rutherford until 1897 when he was sent for two years to a school near Geneva and to the Lyc√©e Condorcet in Paris. He attended the Horace Mann School upon his return to New York City and, having passed a special examination, was admitted in 1902 to the medical school of the University of Pennsylvania, from which he graduated in 1906. Upon leaving Penn, Williams did internships at both French Hospital and Child's Hospital in New York, then went to Leipzig for advanced study of pediatrics. He published his first book, Poems, in 1909. Williams married Florence Herman (1891‚Äì1976) in 1912 after he returned from Germany. They moved into a house in Rutherford, New Jersey, which was their home for many years. Shortly afterward, his second book of poems, The Tempers, was published by a London press through the help of his friend Ezra Pound, whom he had met while studying at the University of Pennsylvania. Around 1914, Williams and his wife had their first son, William E. Williams, followed by their second son, Paul H. Williams, in 1917. Their first son would grow up to follow Williams in becoming a doctor. Although his primary occupation was as a family doctor, Williams had a successful literary career as a poet. His work has a great affinity with painting, in which he had a lifelong interest. In addition to poetry (his main literary focus), he occasionally wrote short stories, plays, novels, essays, and translations. He practiced medicine by day and wrote at night. Early in his career, he briefly became involved in the Imagist movement through his friendships with Pound and H.D. (whom he had befriended during his medical studies at Penn), but soon he began to develop opinions that differed from theirs and his style changed to express his commitment to a modernist expression of his immediate environment. In 1920, Williams was sharply criticized by many of his peers (such as H.D., Pound and Wallace Stevens) when he published one of his more experimental books Kora in Hell: Improvisations. Pound called the work \\"incoherent\\" and H.D. thought the book was \\"flippant\\". The Dada artist and poet Baroness Elsa critiicized Williams's sexual and artistic politics in her experimental prose poem review titled \\"Thee I call 'Hamlet of Wedding Ring'\\", published in The Little Review in March 1921.Gammel, Irene, Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada, and Everyday Modernity. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002, 272. Three years later, Williams published Spring and All, one of his seminal books of poetry, which contained the classic poems \\"By the road to the contagious hospital\\", \\"The Red Wheelbarrow\\" and \\"To Elsie\\". However, in 1922, the year it was published, the appearance of T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land became a literary sensation and overshadowed Williams's very different brand of poetic Modernism. In his Autobiography, Williams later wrote \\"I felt at once that The Waste Land had set me back twenty years and I'm sure it did. Critically, Eliot returned us to the classroom just at the moment when I felt we were on a point to escape to matters much closer to the essence of a new art form itself‚Äîrooted in the locality which should give it fruit\\". Although he respected the work of Eliot, Williams became openly critical of Eliot's highly intellectual style with its frequent use of foreign languages and allusions to classical and European literature.Williams, William Carlos. Selected Essays. New York: Random House, 1954. Instead, Williams preferred colloquial American English.Williams, William Carlos. In the American Grain. New York: New Directions, 1999. In his modernist epic collage of place titled Paterson (published between 1946 and 1958), an account of the history, people, and essence of Paterson, New Jersey, Williams wrote his own modern epic poem, focusing on \\"the local\\" on a wider scale than he had previously attempted. He also examined the role of the poet in American society and famously summarized his poetic method in the phrase \\"No ideas but in things\\" (found in his poem \\"A Sort of a Song\\" and repeated again and again in Paterson). In his later years, Williams mentored and influenced many younger poets. He had a significant influence on many of the American literary movements of the 1950s, including the Beat movement, the San Francisco Renaissance, the Black Mountain school, and the New York School.X. J. Kennedy & Dana Gioai, An Introduction to Poetry, New York: Addison Wesley Longman Inc, 1998. One of Williams's more dynamic relationships as a mentor was with fellow New Jersey poet Allen Ginsberg. Williams included several of Ginsberg's letters in Paterson, stating that one of them helped inspire the fifth section of that work. Williams also wrote the introduction to Ginsberg's first book Howl and Other Poems in 1956. Williams suffered a heart attack in 1948, and after 1949, a series of strokes. Severe depression after one such stroke caused him to be confined to Hillside Hospital, New York, for four months in 1953. He died on March 4, 1963 at the age of 79 at his home in Rutherford. He was buried in Hillside Cemetery in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. During the 1930s, Williams began working on an opera. The opera, titled The First President, was focused on George Washington and his influence on the history of the United States of America and was intended to ‚Äúgalvanize us into a realization of what we are today.‚Äù Poetry \\"The rose fades, and is renewed again ....\\" The poet and critic Randall Jarrell stated of Williams's poetry, > \\"William Carlos Williams is as magically observant and mimetic as a good > novelist. He reproduces the details of what he sees with surprising > freshness, clarity, and economy; and he sees just as extraordinarily, > sometimes, the forms of this earth, the spirit moving behind the letters. > His quick transparent lines have the nervous and contracted strength, move > as jerkily and intently as a bird.\\"Jarrell, Randall. \\"Fifty Years of > American Poetry.\\" No Other Book: Selected Essays. New York: HarperCollins, > 1999. R. P. Blackmur said of Williams's poetry, \\"the Imagism of 1912, self- transcended.\\"Pratt, William. The Imagist Poem, Modern Poetry in Miniature (Story Line Press, 1963, expanded 2001). A contemporary, Harriet Monroe, stated \\"to assert his freedoms he must play the devil, showing himself rioting in purple and turquoise pools of excess.\\"Review of 'Others Again ' ed. By Alfred Kreymborg Poetry: A Magazine of Verse 1915 Williams's major collections are Spring and All (1923), The Desert Music and Other Poems (1954), Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems (1962), and Paterson (1963, repr. 1992). His most anthologized poem is \\"The Red Wheelbarrow\\", an example of the Imagist movement's style and principles (see also \\"This Is Just to Say\\"). However, Williams, like his peer and friend Ezra Pound, had rejected the Imagist movement by the time this poem was published as part of Spring and All in 1923. Williams is strongly associated with the American modernist movement in literature and saw his poetic project as a distinctly American one; he sought to renew language through the fresh, raw idiom that grew out of America's cultural and social heterogeneity, at the same time freeing it from what he saw as the worn-out language of British and European culture. ‚ÄúNo one believes that poetry can exist in his own life,‚Äù Williams said. ‚ÄúThe purpose of an artist, whatever it is, is to take the life, whatever he sees, and to raise it up to an elevated position where it has dignity.‚Äù In 1920, Williams turned his attentions to Contact, a periodical launched by Williams and fellow writer Robert McAlmon: \\"The two editors sought American cultural renewal in the local condition in clear opposition to the internationalists‚ÄîPound, The Little Review, and the Baroness.\\"Gammel, Baroness Elsa, 264-65. Yvor Winters, the poet/critic, judged that Williams's verse bears a certain resemblance to the best lyric poets of the 13th century.Primitivism and Decadence: A Study of American Experimental Poetry. New York: Arrow Editions, 1937. Williams sought to invent an entirely fresh and uniquely American form of poetry whose subject matter centered on everyday circumstances of life and the lives of common people. He came up with the concept of the \\"variable foot\\" which Williams never clearly defined, although the concept vaguely referred to Williams's method of determining line breaks. The Paris Review called it \\"a metrical device to resolve the conflict between form and freedom in verse.\\"Interview with Stanley Koehler, Paris Review, Vol. 6, 1962. One of Williams's aims, in experimenting with his \\"variable foot\\", was to show the American (opposed to European) rhythm that he claimed was present in everyday American language. Stylistically, Williams also worked with variations on a line-break pattern that he labeled \\"triadic-line poetry\\" in which he broke a long line into three free-verse segments. A well-known example of the \\"triadic line [break]\\" can be found in Williams's love-poem \\"Asphodel, That Greeny Flower.\\"Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Twentieth Century, In a review of Herbert Leibowitz's biography of William Carlos Williams, \\"Something Urgent I Have to Say to You\\": The Life and Works of William Carlos Williams, book critic Christopher Benfey wrote of Williams's poetry: \\"Early and late, Williams held the conviction that poetry was, in his friend Kenneth Burke's phrase, 'equipment for living, a necessary guide amid the bewilderments of life.' The American ground was wild and new, a place where a blooming foreigner needed all the help he could get. Poems were as essential to a full life as physical health or the love of men and women.\\" Williams expressed this viewpoint most famously in a line from his poem \\"Asphodel, That Greeny Flower\\" in which he wrote: Williams and the painters Williams' mother had trained as a painter in Paris and passed on her enthusiasm to her son, who also painted in his early years.Bram Dijkstra, Cubism, Stieglitz, and the Early Poetry of William Carlos Williams, pp.6-7 A painting by him now hangs in Yale University's Beineke LibraryEmily Kopley, ‚ÄúArt for the Wrong Reason‚Äù, originally in The New Journal, December 2004 and as late as 1962 he was still remembering in an interview that ‚ÄúI'd like to have been a painter, and it would have given me at least as great a satisfaction as being a poet.‚ÄùInterviewed by Stanley Koehler, Paris Review 32, 1964 For most of his life Williams wrote art criticism and introductions to exhibitions by his friends. In 1915, Williams began to associate with the New York group of artists and writers known as \\"The Others.\\" Founded by the poet Alfred Kreymborg and the artist Man Ray, they included Walter Conrad Arensberg, Wallace Stevens, Mina Loy, Marianne Moore and Marcel Duchamp. Interlocking with them were the US artists who met at Arensburg's studio, including Marsden Hartley, Joseph Stella, Charles Demuth and Charles Sheeler, with whom Williams developed close friendships. Although he championed the new way of seeing and representation pioneered by the European avant-garde, Williams and his artistic friends wished to get away from what they saw as a purely derivative style. As one result, he started Contact magazine with Hartley in 1920 in order to create an outlet for works showcasing the belief that creative work should derive from the artist's direct experience and sense of place and reject traditional notions of how this should be done.Casella, Donna. \\"William Carlos Williams's Contact Magazine: A Rebellion against the Arty Art Worshipers\\", Ball State University Forum 28.3 (1987): 60-75. Charles Demuth's ‚ÄúI saw the figure 5 in gold‚Äù (1928) Precisionism emerged in response to such thinking. In her study of the influence of painting on Williams, Ruth Grogan devoted several paragraphs to the dependency of some of his poems on the paintings of Charles Sheeler in this style, singling out in particular the description of a power house in Williams' ‚ÄúClassic Scene‚Äù.Ruth Grogan, \\"The influence of painting on William Carlos Williams\\" (1969), in The Penguin Critical Anthology devoted to Williams, pp.290-3 But the close relationship with Charles Demuth was more overt. Williams' poem ‚ÄúThe Pot of Flowers‚Äù (1923) references Demuth's painting ‚ÄúTuberoses‚Äù (1922), which he owned. On his side, Demuth created his ‚ÄúI saw the figure 5 in gold‚Äù (1928) as a homage to William's poem ‚ÄúThe Great Figure‚Äù (1921). Williams' collection Spring and All (1923) was dedicated to the artist and, after his early death, he dedicated the long poem ‚ÄúThe Crimson Cyclamen.‚Äù (1936) to Demuth's memory. Later collaborations with artists include the two poem/ two drawing volume that he shared with William Zorach in 1937Penn Libraries and his poem ‚ÄúJersey Lyric‚Äù, written in response to Henry Niese's 1960 painting of the same title:Ilse Munro, ‚ÄúConcerning Craft: Henry Niese and William Carlos Williams\\", Little Patuxen Review, October 2011 > View of winter trees before one tree in the foreground where by fresh-fallen > snow lie 6 woodchunks ready for the fire Throughout his career, Williams thought of his approach to poetry as a painterly deployment of words, saying explicitly in an interview, \\"I've attempted to fuse the poetry and painting, to make it the same thing‚Ä¶.A design in the poem and a design in the picture should make them more or less the same thing.\\"Walter Sutton, \\"A Visit with William Carlos Williams\\", Minnesota Review 1 (April 1961) However, in the case of his references to much earlier painters, culminating in Pictures from Brueghel (1962), his approach was more commentarial. Of this late phase of his work it has been claimed that ‚ÄúWilliams saw these artists solving, in their own ways, the same problems that concerned him,‚ÄùBonnie Costello, ‚ÄúWilliam Carlos Williams in the world of the painters‚Äù, Boston Review, June/July 1979 but his engagement with them was at a distance. Legacy, awards and honors This Is Just To Say (wall poem in The Hague) The U.S. National Book Award was reestablished in 1950 with awards by the book industry to authors of books published in 1949 in three categories. Williams won the first National Book Award for Poetry, recognizing both the third volume of Paterson and Selected Poems. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1950\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-02-25. In 1952, Williams was named Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, but was barred from serving out his term due to unfounded accusations of Williams's membership in a communist organization. Williams retained legal counsel to refute the charges but was never allowed to respond to his critics and never received an apology from the Library of Congress.\\"The Library and its Laureates: The Examples of Auslander, Williams, Dickey & Kumin\\" by Dan Vera, Beltway Poetry Quarterly, Volume 10.4, Fall 2009 http://washingtonart.com/beltway/fourlaureates.htmlWilliam Carlos Williams: Poet from Jersey, by Reed Whittemore, pages 309-314, Houghton Mifflin, 1975, The next year, however, he received the Bollingen Prize along with Archibald MacLeish. In May 1963, he was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems (1962) and the Gold Medal for Poetry of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. The Poetry Society of America presents the William Carlos Williams Award annually for the best book of poetry published by a small, non-profit or university press. Williams's house in Rutherford is now on the National Register of Historic Places. He was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2009.

Among his best-known works is Death of a Naturalist (1966), his first major published volume. Heaney was and is still recognised as one of the principal contributors to poetry in Ireland during his lifetime. American poet Robert Lowell described him as \\"the most important Irish poet since Yeats\\", and many others, including the academic John Sutherland, have said that he was \\"the greatest poet of our age\\". Robert Pinsky has stated that \\"with his wonderful gift of eye and ear Heaney has the gift of the story-teller.\\"Pinsky, Robert. The Eco Press, Hopewell Upon his death in 2013, The Independent described him as \\"probably the best-known poet in the world\\". He was born in the townland of Tamniaran between Castledawson and Toomebridge, Northern Ireland. His family moved to nearby Bellaghy when he was a boy. He became a lecturer at St. Joseph's College in Belfast in the early 1960s, after attending Queen's University and began to publish poetry. He lived in Sandymount, Dublin, from 1976 until his death. He lived part-time in the United States from 1981 to 2006. Heaney was a professor at Harvard from 1981 to 1997, and its Poet in Residence from 1988 to 2006. From 1989 to 1994, he was also the Professor of Poetry at Oxford. In 1996, was made a Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and in 1998 was bestowed the title Saoi of the Aosd√°na. Other awards that he received include the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize (1968), the E. M. Forster Award (1975), the PEN Translation Prize (1985), the Golden Wreath of Poetry (2001), the T. S. Eliot Prize (2006) and two Whitbread Prizes (1996 and 1999). In 2011, he was awarded the Griffin Poetry Prize and in 2012, a Lifetime Recognition Award from the Griffin Trust. His literary papers are held by the National Library of Ireland. He is buried at the Cemetery of St Mary's Church, Bellaghy, Northern Ireland. The headstone bears the epitaph \\"Walk on air against your better judgement\\", from one of his poems, \\"The Gravel Walks\\".  Early life  Heaney was born on 13 April 1939, at the family farmhouse called Mossbawn, Archived at Wayback Engine. between Castledawson and Toomebridge; he was the first of nine children. In 1953, his family moved to Bellaghy, a few miles away, which is now the family home. His father, Patrick Heaney (d. October 1986), was the eighth child of ten born to James and Sarah Heaney. Patrick was a farmer, but his real commitment was to cattle dealing, to which he was introduced by the uncles who had cared for him after the early death of his own parents. Heaney's mother, Margaret Kathleen McCann (1911‚Äì1984), who bore nine children, came from the McCann family. Her uncles and relations were employed in the local linen mill, and her aunt had worked as a maid for the mill owner's family. Heaney commented that his parentage contained both the Ireland of the cattle-herding Gaelic past and the Ulster of the Industrial Revolution; he considered this to have been a significant tension in his background. Heaney attended Anahorish Primary School; when he was twelve years old, he won a scholarship to St Columb's College, a Roman Catholic boarding school in Derry. Heaney's younger brother, Christopher, was killed in a road accident while Heaney was studying at St Columb's. The poems \\"Mid-Term Break\\" and \\"The Blackbird of Glanmore\\" are related to his brother's death. Heaney played football for Castledawson, the club in the area of his birth, as a boy, and did not change to Bellaghy when his family moved there.  Career  =1957‚Äì1969= Seamus Heaney in 1970 In 1957, Heaney travelled to Belfast to study English Language and Literature at Queen's University Belfast. While there, he found a copy of Ted Hughes's Lupercal, which spurred him to write poetry. \\"Suddenly, the matter of contemporary poetry was the material of my own life,\\" he said. He graduated in 1961 with a First Class Honours degree. During teacher training at St Joseph's Teacher Training College in Belfast (now merged with St Mary's, University College), Heaney went on a placement to St Thomas' secondary Intermediate School in west Belfast. The headmaster of this school was the writer Michael McLaverty from County Monaghan, who introduced Heaney to the poetry of Patrick Kavanagh.Ed. Bernard O‚ÄôDonoghue The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney (2009) Cambridge University Press pxiii . Retrieved 23 May 2010. With McLaverty's mentorship, Heaney first started to publish poetry in 1962. Sophia Hillan describes how McLaverty was like a foster father to the younger Belfast poet.Sophia Hillan, New Hibernia Review / Iris √âireannach Nua, Vol. 9, No. 3 (Autumn, 2005), pp. 86‚Äì106. \\"Wintered into Wisdom: Michael McLaverty, Seamus Heaney, and the Northern Word-Hoard\\". University of St. Thomas (Center for Irish Studies) In the introduction to McLaverty's Collected Works, Heaney summarised the poet's contribution and influence: \\"His voice was modestly pitched, he never sought the limelight, yet for all that, his place in our literature is secure.\\"McLaverty, Michael (2002) Collected Short Stories, Blackstaff Press Ltd, p. xiii, . Heaney's poem Fosterage, in the sequence Singing School from North (1975), is dedicated to him. In 1963, Heaney became a lecturer at St Joseph's, and in the spring of 1963, after contributing various articles to local magazines, he came to the attention of Philip Hobsbaum, then an English lecturer at Queen's University. Hobsbaum set up a Belfast Group of local young poets (to mirror the success he had with the London group), and Heaney was able to meet other Belfast poets such as Derek Mahon and Michael Longley. In August 1965, he married Marie Devlin, a school teacher and native of Ardboe, County Tyrone. (Also a writer, Devlin published Over Nine Waves (1994), a collection of traditional Irish myths and legends.) Heaney's first book, Eleven Poems, was published in November 1965 for the Queen's University Festival. In 1966, Faber and Faber published Death of a Naturalist, his first major volume. This collection was met with much critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Gregory Award for Young Writers and the Geoffrey Faber Prize. Also in 1966, Heaney was appointed as a lecturer in Modern English Literature at Queen's University Belfast. That year his first son, Michael, was born. A second son, Christopher, was born in 1968. That year Heaney and Michael Longley undertook a reading tour called Room to Rhyme, which increased awareness of the poet's work. In 1969 he published his second major volume, Door into the Dark. =1970‚Äì1984= After a spell as guest lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, Heaney returned in 1971 to Queen's University. In 1972, Heaney left his lectureship at Belfast, moved to Wicklow in the Republic of Ireland, and began writing on a full-time basis. In the same year, he published Wintering Out. Over the next few years, Heaney began to give readings throughout Ireland, Great Britain and the United States. In 1975, Heaney published his fourth volume, North. A pamphlet of prose poems entitled Stations was published the same year. He became Head of English at Carysfort College in Dublin in 1976, and he moved with his family to Sandymount in that city. His next volume, Field Work, was published in 1979. Selected Poems 1965-1975 and Preoccupations: Selected Prose 1968‚Äì1978 were published in 1980. When Aosd√°na, the national Irish Arts Council, was established in 1981, Heaney was among those elected into its first group. (He was subsequently elected a Saoi, one of its five elders and its highest honour, in 1997). Also in 1981, Heaney traveled to the United States as a visiting professor at Harvard, where he was affiliated with Adams House. He was awarded two honorary doctorates, from Queen's University and from Fordham University in New York City (1982). At the Fordham commencement ceremony on 23 May 1982, Heaney delivered his address as a 46-stanza poem entitled \\"Verses for a Fordham Commencement.\\" Born and educated in Northern Ireland, Heaney stressed that he was Irish and not British. Following the success of the Field Day Theatre Company's production of Brian Friel's Translations, the founders Brian Friel and Stephen Rea decided to make the company a permanent group. Heaney joined the company's expanded Board of Directors in 1981.The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney, \\"Heaney in Public\\" by Dennis O'Driscoll (p56-72). .

Retrieved 19 April 2010. In 1986, Heaney received a Litt.D. from Bates College. His father, Patrick, died in October the same year. The loss of both parents within two years affected Heaney deeply, and he expressed his grief in poems. In 1988, a collection of his critical essays, The Government of the Tongue, was published. In 1985 Heaney wrote the poem \\"From the Republic of Conscience\\" at the request of Amnesty International Ireland. He wanted to \\"celebrate United Nations Day and the work of Amnesty\\". The poem inspired the title of Amnesty International's highest honor, the Ambassador of Conscience Award. In 1988, Heaney donated his lecture notes to the Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Book Library (MARBL) of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, after giving the notable Ellmann Lecture in Modern Literature there.\\"Seamus Heaney Exhibit\\", Emory University, January 2014 In 1989, Heaney was elected Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford, which he held for a five-year term to 1994. The chair does not require residence in Oxford. Throughout this period, he was dividing his time between Ireland and the United States. He also continued to give public readings. So well attended and keenly anticipated were these events that those who queued for tickets with such enthusiasm were sometimes dubbed \\"Heaneyboppers\\", suggesting an almost teenybopper fan base. In 1990, The Cure at Troy, his play based on Sophocles's Philoctetes, was published to much acclaim. The next year, he published another volume of poetry, Seeing Things (1991). Heaney was named an Honorary Patron of the University Philosophical Society, Trinity College, Dublin, and was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (1991). In 1993, Heaney guest-edited The Mays Anthology, a collection of new writing from students at the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge. That same year, he was awarded the Dickinson College Arts Award and returned to the Pennsylvania college to deliver the commencement address and receive an honorary degree. He was scheduled to return to Dickinson again to receive the Harold and Ethel L. Stellfox Award‚Äîfor a major literary figure‚Äîat the time of his death in 2013. Irish poet Paul Muldoon was named recipient of the award that year, partly in recognition of the close connection between the two poets. Heaney was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995 for what the Nobel committee described as \\"works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past\\". He was on holiday in Greece with his wife when the news broke. Neither journalists nor his own children could reach him until he arrived at Dublin Airport two days later, although an Irish television camera traced him to Kalamata. Asked how he felt to have his name added to the Irish Nobel pantheon of W. B. Yeats, George Bernard Shaw and Samuel Beckett, Heaney responded: \\"It's like being a little foothill at the bottom of a mountain range. You hope you just live up to it. It's extraordinary.\\" He and his wife Marie were immediately taken from the airport to √Åras an Uachtar√°in for champagne with President Mary Robinson. He would refer to the prize discreetly as \\"the N thing\\" in personal exchanges with others. Heaney's 1996 collection The Spirit Level won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award; he repeated the success in 1999 with Beowulf: A New Verse Translation. Heaney was elected a Member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1996 and was admitted in 1997. In the same year, Heaney was elected Saoi of Aosd√°na. In 1998, Heaney was elected Honorary Fellow of Trinity College Dublin. =2000s= The Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry, which was officially opened at Queen's University Belfast in 2004 In 2000, Heaney was awarded an honorary doctorate and delivered the commencement address at the University of Pennsylvania.University of Pennsylvania.

In 2002, Heaney was awarded an honorary doctorate from Rhodes University and delivered a public lecture on \\"The Guttural Muse\\". from the Rhodes University website. In 2003, the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry was opened at Queen's University Belfast. It houses the Heaney Media Archive, a record of Heaney's entire oeuvre, along with a full catalogue of his radio and television presentations.The Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry, Queen's University Belfast website That same year, Heaney decided to lodge a substantial portion of his literary archive at Emory University as a memorial to the work of William M. Chace, the university's recently retired president. The Emory papers represented the largest repository of Heaney's work (1964‚Äì2003). He donated these to help build their large existing archive of material from Irish writers including Yeats, Paul Muldoon, Ciaran Carson, Michael Longley and other members of The Belfast Group.Emory University. Manuscripts, Archives and Rare Book Library (MARBL) . Online collection of The Belfast Group archive. In 2003, when asked if there was any figure in popular culture who aroused interest in poetry and lyrics, Heaney praised American rap artist Eminem from Detroit, saying, \\"He has created a sense of what is possible. He has sent a voltage around a generation. He has done this not just through his subversive attitude but also his verbal energy.\\"Eminem, The Way I Am, autobiography, cover sheet. Published 21 October 2008. Heaney wrote the poem \\"Beacons at Bealtaine\\" to mark the 2004 EU Enlargement. He read the poem at a ceremony for the 25 leaders of the enlarged European Union, arranged by the Irish EU presidency. In August 2006, Heaney suffered a stroke. Although he recovered and joked, \\"Blessed are the pacemakers\\" when fitted with a heart monitor,\\"Heaney bid farewell at funeral\\", Belfast Telegraph, 2 September 2013. he cancelled all public engagements for several months.Today Programme, BBC Radio 4, 16 January 2007. He was in County Donegal at the time of the 75th birthday of Anne Friel, wife of playwright Brian Friel. He read the works of Henning Mankell, Donna Leon and Robert Harris while in hospital. Among his visitors was former President Bill Clinton. Heaney's District and Circle won the 2006 T. S. Eliot Prize. In 2008, he became artist of honour in √òstermarie, Denmark, and Seamus Heaney Str√¶de (street) was named after him. In 2009, Heaney was presented with an Honorary-Life Membership award from the University College Dublin (UCD) Law Society, in recognition of his remarkable role as a literary figure. Faber and Faber published Dennis O'Driscoll's book Stepping Stones: Interviews with Seamus Heaney in 2008; this has been described as the nearest thing to an autobiography of Heaney. In 2009, Heaney was awarded the David Cohen Prize for Literature. He spoke at the West Belfast Festival 2010 in celebration of his mentor, the poet and novelist Michael McLaverty, who had helped Heaney to first publish his poetry. Archived at Wayback Engine. =2010s= In 2010, Faber published Human Chain, Heaney's twelfth collection. Human Chain was awarded the Forward Poetry Prize for Best Collection, one of the major poetry prizes Heaney had never previously won, despite having been twice shortlisted. The book, published 44 years after the poet's first, was inspired in part by Heaney's stroke in 2006, which left him \\"babyish\\" and \\"on the brink\\". Poet and Forward judge Ruth Padel described the work as \\"a collection of painful, honest and delicately weighted poems ... a wonderful and humane achievement.\\" Writer Colm T√≥ib√≠n described Human Chain as \\"his best single volume for many years, and one that contains some of the best poems he has written... is a book of shades and memories, of things whispered, of journeys into the underworld, of elegies and translations, of echoes and silences.\\" In October 2010, the collection was shortlisted for the T. S. Eliot Prize. Heaney was named one of \\"Britain's top 300 intellectuals\\" by The Observer in 2011, though the newspaper later published a correction acknowledging that \\"several individuals who would not claim to be British\\" had been featured, of which Heaney was one. That same year, he contributed translations of Old Irish marginalia for Songs of the Scribe, an album by Traditional Singer in Residence of the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry, P√°draig√≠n N√≠ Uallach√°in.\\"Songs of the Scribe Sung by P√°draig√≠n N√≠ Uallach√°in\\". Journal of Music. 6 December 2011. In December 2011, he donated his personal literary notes to the National Library of Ireland. Even though he admitted he would likely have earned a fortune by auctioning them, Heaney personally packed up the boxes of notes and drafts and, accompanied by his son Michael, delivered them to the National Library. In June 2012, Heaney accepted the Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry's Lifetime Recognition Award and gave a speech in honour of the award. Heaney was compiling a collection of his work in anticipation of Selected Poems 1988‚Äì2013 at the time of his death. The selection includes poems and writings from Seeing Things, The Spirit Level, the translation of Beowulf, Electric Light, District and Circle, and Human Chain (fall 2014). In February 2014, Emory University premiered Seamus Heaney: The Music of What Happens, the first major exhibition to celebrate the life and work of Seamus Heaney since his death. The exhibit holds a display of the surface of Heaney's personal writing desk that he used in the 1980s as well as old photographs and personal correspondence with other writers. Heaney died in August 2013, during the exhibition's curatorial process. Though the exhibit's original vision to celebrate Heaney's life and work remains at the forefront, there is a small section commemorating his death and its influence. In September 2015, it was announced that Heaney's family would posthumously publish his translation of Book VI of The Aeneid in 2016. Death Seamus Heaney died in the Blackrock Clinic in Dublin on 30 August 2013, aged 74, following a short illness.HEANEY, Seamus : Death notice The Irish Times, 30 September 2013.Higgins to lead mourners at funeral Mass for poet Sunday Independent, 1 September 2013. After a fall outside a restaurant in Dublin, he entered hospital for a medical procedure, but died at 7:30 the following morning before it took place.

Jos√© Manuel Barroso, European Commission president, said: > I am greatly saddened today to learn of the death of Seamus Heaney, one of > the great European poets of our lifetime. ... The strength, beauty and > character of his words will endure for generations to come and were rightly > recognised with the Nobel Prize for Literature.

For us, as for people around the world, he epitomised > the poet as a wellspring of humane insight and artful imagination, subtle > wisdom and shining grace. We will remember him with deep affection and > admiration. Poet Michael Longley, a close friend of Heaney, said: \\"I feel like I've lost a brother.\\" Thomas Kinsella said he was shocked, but John Montague said he had known for some time that the poet was not well. Playwright Frank McGuinness called Heaney \\"the greatest Irishman of my generation: he had no rivals.\\" Colm T√≥ib√≠n wrote: \\"In a time of burnings and bombings Heaney used poetry to offer an alternative world.\\" Gerald Dawe said he was \\"like an older brother who encouraged you to do the best you could do\\". Theo Dorgan said, \\"[Heaney's] work will pass into permanence. Everywhere I go there is real shock at this. Seamus was one of us.\\" His publisher, Faber and Faber, noted that \\"his impact on literary culture is immeasurable.\\" Playwright Tom Stoppard said, \\"Seamus never had a sour moment, neither in person nor on paper\\". Andrew Motion, a former UK Poet Laureate and friend of Heaney, called him \\"a great poet, a wonderful writer about poetry, and a person of truly exceptional grace and intelligence.\\" Many memorial events were held, including a commemoration at Emory University, Harvard University, Oxford University and the Southbank Centre, London. Leading US poetry organisations also met in New York to commemorate the death. Work =Naturalism= At one time, Heaney's books made up two-thirds of the sales of living poets in the UK. His work often deals with the local surroundings of Ireland, particularly in Northern Ireland, where he was born and lived until young adulthood. Speaking of his early life and education, he commented, \\"I learned that my local County Derry experience, which I had considered archaic and irrelevant to 'the modern world', was to be trusted. They taught me that trust and helped me to articulate it.\\" Death of a Naturalist (1966) and Door into the Dark (1969) mostly focus on the details of rural, parochial life. In a number of volumes, beginning with Door into the Dark (1969) and Wintering Out (1972), Heaney also spent a significant amount of time writing on the northern Irish bog. Particularly of note is the collection of bog body poems in North (1975), featuring mangled bodies preserved in the bog. In a review by Ciaran Carson, he said that the bog poems made Heaney into \\"the laureate of violence‚Äîa mythmaker, an anthropologist of ritual killing...the world of megalithic doorways and charming noble barbarity.\\" Poems such as \\"Bogland\\" and \\"Bog Queen\\" addressed political struggles directly for the first time. =Politics= Allusions to sectarian difference, widespread in Northern Ireland through his lifetime, can be found in his poems. His books Wintering Out (1973) and North (1975) seek to interweave commentary on the Troubles with a historical context and wider human experience. While some critics accused Heaney of being \\"an apologist and a mythologiser\\" of the violence, Blake Morrison suggests the poet > has written poems directly about the Troubles as well as elegies for friends > and acquaintances who have died in them; he has tried to discover a > historical framework in which to interpret the current unrest; and he has > taken on the mantle of public spokesman, someone looked to for comment and > guidance... Yet he has also shown signs of deeply resenting this role, > defending the right of poets to be private and apolitical, and questioning > the extent to which poetry, however \\"committed\\", can influence the course of > history. Shaun O'Connell in the New Boston Review notes that \\"those who see Seamus Heaney as a symbol of hope in a troubled land are not, of course, wrong to do so, though they may be missing much of the undercutting complexities of his poetry, the backwash of ironies which make him as bleak as he is bright.\\" O'Connell notes in his Boston Review critique of Station Island: > Again and again Heaney pulls back from political purposes; despite its > emblems of savagery, Station Island lends no rhetorical comfort to > Republicanism. Politic about politics, Station Island is less about a united > Ireland than about a poet seeking religious and aesthetic unity. Heaney is described by critic Terry Eagleton as \\"an enlightened cosmopolitan liberal\\", refusing to be drawn. Eagleton suggests: \\"When the political is introduced... it is only in the context of what Heaney will or will not say.\\" Reflections on what Heaney identifies as \\"tribal conflict\\" favour the description of people's lives and their voices, drawing out the \\"psychic landscape\\". His collections often recall the assassinations of his family members and close friends, lynchings and bombings. Colm T√≥ib√≠n wrote, \\"throughout his career there have been poems of simple evocation and description. His refusal to sum up or offer meaning is part of his tact.\\" Heaney published \\"Requiem for the Croppies\\", a poem that commemorates the Irish rebels of 1798, on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. He read the poem to both Catholic and Protestant audiences in Ireland. He commented, \\"To read 'Requiem for the Croppies' wasn't to say ‚Äòup the IRA‚Äô or anything. It was silence-breaking rather than rabble-rousing.\\" He stated, \\"You don't have to love it. You just have to permit it.\\" He turned down the offer of laureateship of the United Kingdom, partly for political reasons, commenting, \\"I‚Äôve nothing against the Queen personally: I had lunch at the Palace once upon a time.\\" He stated that his \\"cultural starting point\\" was \\"off-centre\\". A much-quoted statement was when he objected to being included in The Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry (1982). Although he was born in Northern Ireland, his response to being included in the British anthology was delivered in his poem \\"An Open Letter\\": :Don't be surprised if I demur, for, be advised :My passport's green. :No glass of ours was ever raised :To toast The Queen. =Translation= He was concerned, as a poet and a translator, with the English language as it is spoken in Ireland but also as spoken elsewhere and in other times; he explored Anglo-Saxon influences in his work and study. Critic W. S. Di Piero noted > Whatever the occasion, childhood, farm life, politics and culture in > Northern Ireland, other poets past and present, Heaney strikes time and > again at the taproot of language, examining its genetic structures, trying > to discover how it has served, in all its changes, as a culture bearer, a > world to contain imaginations, at once a rhetorical weapon and nutriment of > spirit. He writes of these matters with rare discrimination and > resourcefulness, and a winning impatience with received wisdom. Heaney's first translation was of the Irish lyric poem Buile Suibhne, published as Sweeney Astray: A Version from the Irish (1984). He took up this character and connection in poems published in Station Island (1984). Heaney's prize-winning translation of Beowulf (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2000, Whitbread Book of the Year Award) was considered groundbreaking in its use of modern language melded with the original Anglo-Saxon \\"music\\". =Plays and prose= His plays include The Cure at Troy: A Version of Sophocles' Philoctetes (1991). Heaney's 2004 play, The Burial at Thebes, suggests parallels between Creon and the foreign policies of the Bush administration. Heaney's engagement with poetry as a necessary engine for cultural and personal change is reflected in his prose works The Redress of Poetry (1995) and Finders Keepers: Selected Prose, 1971‚Äì2001 (2002). > \\"When a poem rhymes,\\" Heaney wrote, \\"when a form generates itself, when a > metre provokes consciousness into new postures, it is already on the side of > life. When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, > that in itself protests against necessity. When language does more than > enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of > overlife, and rebels at limit.\\" He continues: \\"The vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place\\". Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and critical engagement with 20th-century Eastern European poets, and in particular Nobel laureate Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz.Kay, Magdalena. In Gratitude for all the Gifts: Seamus Heaney and Eastern Europe. University of Toronto Press, 2012. =Use in the school syllabus= Heaney's work is used extensively in the school syllabus internationally, including the anthologies The Rattle Bag (1982) and The School Bag (1997) (both edited with Ted Hughes). Originally entitled The Faber Book of Verse for Younger People on the Faber contract, Hughes and Heaney decided the main purpose of The Rattle Bag was to offer enjoyment to the reader: \\"Arbitrary riches.\\" Heaney commented \\"the book in our heads was something closer to The Fancy Free Poetry Supplement.\\" It included work that they would have liked to encountered sooner in their own lives, as well as nonsense rhymes, ballad-type poems, riddles, folk songs and rhythmical jingles. Much familiar canonical work was not included, since they took it for granted that their audience would know the standard fare. Fifteen years later, The School Bag aimed at something different. The foreword stated that they wanted \\"less of a carnival, more like a checklist.\\" It included poems in English, Irish, Welsh, Scots and Scots Gaelic, together with work reflecting the African-American experience. Legacy The Seamus Heaney HomePlace, in Bellaghy, is a literary and arts centre which commemorates Heaney's legacy.video tribute. In November 2019, the documentary Seamus Heaney and the music of what happens was aired on BBC Two. His wife Marie and his children talked about their family life and read some of the poems he wrote for them. For the first time, Heaney's four brothers remembered their childhood and the shared experiences that inspired many of his finest poems.

The swans' closest relatives include the geese and ducks. Swans are grouped with the closely related geese in the subfamily Anserinae where they form the tribe Cygnini. Sometimes, they are considered a distinct subfamily, Cygninae. There are six living (and many extinct) species of swan; in addition, there is a species known as the coscoroba swan which is no longer considered one of the true swans. Swans usually mate for life, although divorce sometimes occurs, particularly following nesting failure, and if a mate dies, the remaining swan will take up with another. The number of eggs in each clutch ranges from three to eight. Etymology and terminology The English word 'swan', akin to the German Schwan, Dutch zwaan and Swedish svan, is derived from Indo-European root *swen (to sound, to sing). Young swans are known as swanlings or as cygnets; the latter derives via Old French cigne or cisne (diminutive suffix -et \\"little\\") from the Latin word ', a variant form of cycnus \\"swan\\", itself from the Greek k√Ωknos, a word of the same meaning.. An adult male is a cob, from Middle English cobbe (leader of a group); an adult female is a pen. Description Mute swan landing on water. Due to the size and weight of most swans, large areas of open land or water are required to successfully take off and land. Swans are the largest extant members of the waterfowl family Anatidae, and are among the largest flying birds. The largest species, including the mute swan, trumpeter swan, and whooper swan, can reach a length of over and weigh over . Their wingspans can be over . Compared to the closely related geese, they are much larger and have proportionally larger feet and necks. Quite unusual for birds, swans have \\"teeth\\" - jagged parts of their bill that are used for catching and eating fish. Adults also have a patch of unfeathered skin between the eyes and bill. The sexes are alike in plumage, but males are generally bigger and heavier than females. The Northern Hemisphere species of swan have pure white plumage, but the Southern Hemisphere species are mixed black and white. The Australian black swan (Cygnus atratus) is completely black except for the white flight feathers on its wings; the chicks of black swans are light grey. The South American black- necked swan has a white body with a black neck. Swans' legs are normally a dark blackish grey colour, except for the South American black-necked swan, which has pink legs. Bill colour varies: the four subarctic species have black bills with varying amounts of yellow, and all the others are patterned red and black. Although birds do not have teeth, swans have beaks with serrated edges that look like small jagged 'teeth' as part of their beaks used for catching and eating aquatic plants and algae, but also molluscs, small fish, frogs, and worms.\\"Mute Swan. Feeding\\" , Royal Society for the Protection of Birds The mute swan and black-necked swan have lumps at the base of their bills on the upper mandible. Distribution and movements Whooper swans migrate from Iceland, Greenland, Scandinavia, and Northern Russia to Europe, Central Asia, China, and Japan Swans are generally found in temperate environments, rarely occurring in the tropics. A group of swans is called a bevy or a wedge in flight. Four (or five) species occur in the Northern Hemisphere, one species is found in Australia, one extinct species was found in New Zealand and the Chatham Islands, and one species is distributed in southern South America. They are absent from tropical Asia, Central America, northern South America and the entirety of Africa. One species, the mute swan, has been introduced to North America, Australia and New Zealand. Several species are migratory, either wholly or partly so. The mute swan is a partial migrant, being resident over areas of Western Europe but wholly migratory in Eastern Europe and Asia. The whooper swan and tundra swan are wholly migratory, and the trumpeter swans are almost entirely migratory. There is some evidence that the black-necked swan is migratory over part of its range, but detailed studies have not established whether these movements are long or short range migration. Behaviour Courting swan on Danube Swans feed in water and on land. They are almost entirely herbivorous, although they may eat small amounts of aquatic animals. In the water, food is obtained by up-ending or dabbling, and their diet is composed of the roots, tubers, stems and leaves of aquatic and submerged plants. Toyako, Japan. Swans famously mate for life, and typically bond even before they reach sexual maturity. Trumpeter swans, for example, who can live as long as 24 years and only start breeding at the age of 4‚Äì7, form monogamous pair bonds as early as 20 months. \\"Divorce\\", though rare, does occur; one study of mute swans showing a 3% rate for pairs that breed successfully and 9% for pairs that do not. The pair bonds are maintained year- round, even in gregarious and migratory species like the tundra swan, which congregate in large flocks in the wintering grounds. Swan's nests are on the ground near water and about a metre across. Unlike many other ducks and geese, the male helps with the nest construction, and will also take turns incubating the eggs. Alongside the whistling ducks, swans are the only anatids that will do this. Average egg size (for the mute swan) is 113√ó74 mm, weighing 340 g, in a clutch size of 4 to 7, and an incubation period of 34‚Äì45 days.\\"Mute Swan\\". British Trust for Ornithology Swans are highly protective of their nests. They will viciously attack anything that they perceive as a threat to their chicks, including humans. One man was suspected to have drowned in such an attack. Swans' intraspecific aggressive behaviour is shown more frequent than interspecific behaviour for food and shelter. The aggression with other species is shown more in Bewick's Swans. Systematics and evolution Black- necked swan at WWT London Wetland Centre Black swan in Teres√≥polis, Brazil Evidence suggests that the genus Cygnus evolved in Europe or western Eurasia during the Miocene, spreading all over the Northern Hemisphere until the Pliocene. When the southern species branched off is not known. The mute swan apparently is closest to the Southern Hemisphere Cygnus; its habits of carrying the neck curved (not straight) and the wings fluffed (not flush) as well as its bill color and knob indicate that its closest living relative is the black swan. Given the biogeography and appearance of the subgenus Olor it seems likely that these are of a more recent origin, as evidence shows by their modern ranges (which were mostly uninhabitable during the last ice age) and great similarity between the taxa. =Phylogeny= =Species= Genus Cygnus * Subgenus Olor Mute swan, Cygnus olor, is a Eurasian species that occurs at lower latitudes than the whooper swan and Bewick's swan across Europe into southern Russia, China and the Russian Maritimes. Recent fossil records, according to the British Ornithological Union, show Cygnus olor is among the oldest bird species still extant and it has been upgraded to \\"native\\" status in several European countries, since this bird has been found in fossil and bog specimens dating back thousands of years. Common temperate Eurasian birds, often semi-domesticated descendants of domestic flocks, are naturalized in the United States and elsewhere. * Subgenus Chenopis Black swan, Cygnus atratus of Australia, introduced into New Zealand and the Chatham Islands * Subgenus Sthenelides Black-necked swan, Cygnus melancoryphus of South America * Subgenus Cygnus Whooper swan, Cygnus cygnus breeds in Iceland and subarctic Europe and Asia, migrating to temperate Europe and Asia in winter Trumpeter swan, Cygnus buccinator is the largest North American swan. Very similar to the whooper swan (and sometimes treated as a subspecies of it), it was hunted almost to extinction, but has since recovered. Tundra swan, Cygnus columbianus breeds on the Arctic tundra and winters in more temperate regions of Eurasia and North America. It consists of two forms, generally considered to be subspecies. *Bewick's swan, Cygnus (columbianus) bewickii is the Eurasian form that migrates from Arctic Russia to western Europe and eastern Asia (China, Korea, Japan) in winter. *Whistling swan, Cygnus (columbianus) columbianus is the North American form. The coscoroba swan (Coscoroba coscoroba) from South America, the only species in its genus, is apparently not a true swan. Its phylogenetic position is not fully resolved; it is in some aspects more similar to geese and shelducks. An adult trumpeter swan in Jackson Hole, Wyoming =Fossil record= Black swan skeleton (Museum of Osteology) The fossil record of the genus Cygnus is quite impressive, although allocation to the subgenera is often tentative; as indicated above, at least the early forms probably belong to the C. olor ‚Äì Southern Hemisphere lineage, whereas the Pleistocene taxa from North America would be placed in Olor. A number of prehistoric species have been described, mostly from the Northern Hemisphere. In the Mediterranean, the leg bones of the giant swan (C. falconeri) were found on the islands of Malta and Sicily; it may have been over 2 meters from tail to bill, which was taller (though not heavier) than the contemporary local dwarf elephants (Palaeoloxodon falconeri). * Subgenus Chenopis ‚Ä†New Zealand swan, Cygnus sumnerensis, an extinct species related to the black swan of Australia * Other subgenera (see above): ‚Ä†Cygnus csakvarensis Lambrecht 1933 [Cygnus cs√°kv√°rensis Lambrecht 1931a nomen nudum; Cygnanser csakvarensis (Lambrecht 1933) Kretzoi 1957; Olor csakvarensis (Lambrecht 1933) Ml√≠kovsk√Ω 1992b] (Late Miocene of Hungary) ‚Ä†Cygnus mariae Bickart 1990 (Early Pliocene of Wickieup, U.S.) ‚Ä†Cygnus verae Boev 2000 (Early Pliocene of Sofia, Bulgaria)Boev, Z. 2000. \\"Cygnus verae sp. n.

In culture =European motifs= Many of the cultural aspects refer to the mute swan of Europe. Perhaps the best known story about a swan is the fable \\"The Ugly Duckling\\". Swans are often a symbol of love or fidelity because of their long-lasting, apparently monogamous relationships. See Wagner's famous swan-related operas Lohengrin and Parsifal. =As food= Swan meat was regarded as a luxury food in England in the reign of Elizabeth I. A recipe for baked swan survives from that time: \\"To bake a Swan Scald it and take out the bones, and parboil it, then season it very well with Pepper, Salt and Ginger, then lard it, and put it in a deep Coffin of Rye Paste with store of Butter, close it and bake it very well, and when it is baked, fill up the Vent-hole with melted Butter, and so keep it; serve it in as you do the Beef-Pie.\\" The Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady, a religious confraternity which existed in 's-Hertogenbosch in the late Middle Ages, had 'sworn members', also called 'swan-brethren' because they used to donate a swan for the yearly banquet. =Heraldics= Irish commemorative coin in celebration of its EU presidency ≈Åabƒôd≈∫\\" (Polish for \\"Swan\\") is a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian coat of arms which was used by many Polish szlachta and Lithuanian Bajorai (noble) families under the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The variant here given is the coat-of-arms of writer Henryk Sienkiewicz's family. =Greek mythology= Swans feature strongly in mythology. In Greek mythology, the story of Leda and the Swan recounts that Helen of Troy was conceived in a union of Zeus disguised as a swan and Leda, Queen of Sparta. Other references in classical literature include the belief that, upon death, the mute swan would sing beautifully‚Äîhence the phrase swan song. Juvenal made a sarcastic reference to a good woman being a \\"rare bird, as rare on earth as a black swan\\", from which we get the Latin phrase ' (rare bird). The mute swan is also one of the sacred birds of Apollo, whose associations stem both from the nature of the bird as a symbol of light, as well as the notion of a \\"swan song\\". The god is often depicted riding a chariot pulled by or composed of swans in his ascension from Delos. =Irish lore and poetry= The Irish legend of the Children of Lir is about a stepmother transforming her children into swans for 900 years. In the legend The Wooing of Etain, the king of the Sidhe (subterranean-dwelling, supernatural beings) transforms himself and the most beautiful woman in Ireland, Etain, into swans to escape from the king of Ireland and Ireland's armies. The swan has recently been depicted on an Irish commemorative coin. Swans are also present in Irish literature in the poetry of W.B. Yeats. \\"The Wild Swans at Coole\\" has a heavy focus on the mesmerising characteristics of the swan. Yeats also recounts the myth of Leda and the Swan in the poem of the same name. =Scandinavian lore= In Norse mythology, there are two swans that drink from the sacred Well of Urd in the realm of Asgard, home of the gods. According to the Prose Edda, the water of this well is so pure and holy that all things that touch it turn white, including this original pair of swans and all others descended from them. The poem Volundarkvida, or the Lay of Volund, part of the Poetic Edda, also features swan maidens. In the Finnish epic Kalevala, a swan lives in the Tuoni river located in Tuonela, the underworld realm of the dead. According to the story, whoever killed a swan would perish as well. Jean Sibelius composed the Lemmink√§inen Suite based on Kalevala, with the second piece entitled Swan of Tuonela (Tuonelan joutsen). Today, five flying swans are the symbol of the Nordic Countries, the whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus) is the national bird of Finland, and the mute swan is the national bird of Denmark. =Swan Lake ballet= The ballet Swan Lake is among the most canonic of classical ballets. Based on the 1875‚Äì76 score by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, the most promulgated choreographic version was created by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov (1895), the premiere of which was danced by the Imperial Ballet at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg. The ballet's lead dual roles of Odette (white swan) / Odile (black swan) represent good and evil, and are among the most challenging rolesThe ballet Swan Lake is among the most canonic of classical ballets. Based on the 1875-76 score by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, the most promulgated choreographic version was created by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov (1895), the premiere of which was danced by the Imperial Ballet at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg. The ballet's lead dual roles of Odette/Odile represent good and evil, and are among the most challenging roles created in Romantic classical ballet. created in Romantic classical ballet. The ballet is in the repertories of ballet companies around the world. =Rabelais= French satirist Fran√ßois Rabelais wrote in Gargantua and Pantagruel that a swan's neck was the best toilet paper he had encountered. =Christianity= St Hugh of Lincoln with swan A swan is one of the attributes of St. Hugh of Lincoln, based on the story of a swan who was devoted to him. =Spanish language literature= In Latin American literature, the Nicaraguan poet Rub√©n Dar√≠o (1867‚Äì1916) consecrated the swan as a symbol of artistic inspiration by drawing attention to the constancy of swan imagery in Western culture, beginning with the rape of Leda and ending with Wagner's Lohengrin. Dar√≠o's most famous poem in this regard is Blas√≥n ‚Äì \\"Coat of Arms\\" (1896), and his use of the swan made it a symbol for the Modernismo poetic movement that dominated Spanish language poetry from the 1880s until the First World War. Such was the dominance of Modernismo in Spanish language poetry that the Mexican poet Enrique Gonz√°lez Mart√≠nez attempted to announce the end of Modernismo with a sonnet provocatively entitled, Tu√©rcele el cuello al cisne ‚Äì \\"Wring the Swan's Neck\\" (1910). =Hinduism= Swans are revered in Hinduism, and are compared to saintly persons whose chief characteristic is to be in the world without getting attached to it, just as a swan's feather does not get wet although it is in water. The Sanskrit word for swan is hamsa and the \\"Raja Hamsam\\" or the Royal Swan is the vehicle of Goddess Saraswati which symbolises the \\"Sattva Guna\\" or purity par excellence. The swan if offered a mixture of milk and water, is said to be able to drink the milk alone. Therefore, Goddess Saraswati the goddess of knowledge is seen riding the swan because the swan thus symbolizes \\"Viveka\\" i.e. prudence and discrimination between the good and the bad or between the eternal and the transient. This is taken as great quality, as shown by this Sanskrit verse: {style=\\"width=100%;\\" width=50% valign=top:ha·πÅsa·∏• ≈õveto baka·∏• ≈õveta·∏• ko bhedo bakaha·πÅsayo·∏• ‡•§ :k·π£ƒ´ranƒ´raviveke tu ha·πÅso ha·πÅsa·∏• bako baka·∏• ‡•• width=50% valign=top:The swan is white, the crane is white, what is the difference between the swan and the crane? :During discriminating between water and milk, the swan is a swan while the crane is a crane! } It is mentioned several times in the Vedic literature, and persons who have attained great spiritual capabilities are sometimes called Paramahamsa (\\"Supreme Swan\\") on account of their spiritual grace and ability to travel between various spiritual worlds. In the Vedas, swans are said to reside in the summer on Lake Manasarovar and migrate to Indian lakes for the winter. They are believed to possess some powers, such as the ability to eat pearls. =Indo-European religions= Swans are intimately associated with the divine twins in Indo-European religions, and it is thought that in Proto-Indo- European times, swans were a solar symbol associated with the divine twins and the original Indo-European sun goddess. =Black swans= The Black Swan theory originates from the erroneous presumption in Ancient Rome that black swans did not exist, leading to the black swan as a metaphor for something that could, in theory exist, but does not. After the \\"discovery\\" of actual black swans, this became a metaphor or analogy for something, typically an unexpected event or outlier, that has an unforeseen significance.

Unicode Egyptian Hieroglyphs as of version 5.2 (2009) assigned 1,070 Unicode characters. Cursive hieroglyphs were used for religious literature on papyrus and wood. The later hieratic and demotic Egyptian scripts were derived from hieroglyphic writing, as was the Proto-Sinaitic script that later evolved into the Phoenician alphabet.Michael C. Howard (2012). Transnationalism in Ancient and Medieval Societies. P. 23. Through the Phoenician alphabet's major child systems, the Greek and Aramaic scripts, the Egyptian hieroglyphic script is ancestral to the majority of scripts in modern use, most prominently the Latin and Cyrillic scripts (through Greek) and the Arabic script and Brahmic family of scripts (through Aramaic). The use of hieroglyphic writing arose from proto-literate symbol systems in the Early Bronze Age, around the 32nd century BC (Naqada III), with the first decipherable sentence written in the Egyptian language dating to the Second Dynasty (28th century BC). Egyptian hieroglyphs developed into a mature writing system used for monumental inscription in the classical language of the Middle Kingdom period; during this period, the system made use of about 900 distinct signs. The use of this writing system continued through the New Kingdom and Late Period, and on into the Persian and Ptolemaic periods. Late survivals of hieroglyphic use are found well into the Roman period, extending into the 4th century AD. With the final closing of pagan temples in the 5th century, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was lost. Although attempts were made, the script remained undeciphered throughout the Middle Ages and the early modern period. The decipherment of hieroglyphic writing was finally accomplished in the 1820s by Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion, with the help of the Rosetta Stone. Etymology The word hieroglyph comes from the Greek adjective (hieroglyphikos),. a compound of ( 'sacred'). and Œ≥ŒªœçœÜœâ (gl√Ωph≈ç '(Œô) carve, engrave'; see glyph).. The glyphs themselves, since the Ptolemaic period, were called (t√† hieroglyphik√† [gr√°mmata]) \\"the sacred engraved letters\\", the Greek counterpart to the Egyptian expression of mdw.w-n·πØr \\"god's words\\".Antonio Loprieno, Ancient Egyptian: A Linguistic Introduction (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1995), p. 11. Greek meant \\"a carver of hieroglyphs\\".. In English, hieroglyph as a noun is recorded from 1590, originally short for nominalised hieroglyphic (1580s, with a plural hieroglyphics), from adjectival use (hieroglyphic character). History and evolution =Origin= Paintings with symbols on Naqada II pottery (3500‚Äì3200 BC) Hieroglyphs may have emerged from the preliterate artistic traditions of Egypt. For example, symbols on Gerzean pottery from c. 4000 BC have been argued to resemble hieroglyphic writing. Abydos, carbon-dated to circa 3400‚Äì3200 BC and among the earliest form of writing in Egypt. They are similar to contemporary tags from Uruk, Mesopotamia. Proto-hieroglyphic symbol systems developed in the second half of the 4th millennium BC, such as the clay labels of a Predynastic ruler called \\"Scorpion I\\" (Naqada IIIA period, c. 33rd century BC) recovered at Abydos (modern Umm el-Qa'ab) in 1998 or the Narmer Palette (c. 31st century BC). The first full sentence written in mature hieroglyphs so far discovered was found on a seal impression in the tomb of Seth-Peribsen at Umm el-Qa'ab, which dates from the Second Dynasty (28th or 27th century BC). Around 800 hieroglyphs are known to date back to the Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom Eras. By the Greco-Roman period, there were more than 5,000. Geoffrey Sampson stated that Egyptian hieroglyphs \\"came into existence a little after Sumerian script, and, probably, [were] invented under the influence of the latter\\", and that it is \\"probable that the general idea of expressing words of a language in writing was brought to Egypt from Sumerian Mesopotamia\\".Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards, et al., The Cambridge Ancient History (3d ed. 1970) pp. 43‚Äì44. There are many instances of early Egypt-Mesopotamia relations, but given the lack of direct evidence for the transfer of writing, \\"no definitive determination has been made as to the origin of hieroglyphics in ancient Egypt\\". Others have held that \\"the evidence for such direct influence remains flimsy‚Äù and that ‚Äúa very credible argument can also be made for the independent development of writing in Egypt...\\"Simson Najovits, Egypt, Trunk of the Tree: A Modern Survey of an Ancient Land, Algora Publishing, 2004, pp. 55‚Äì56. Since the 1990s, the above-mentioned discoveries of glyphs at Abydos, dated to between 3400 and 3200 BCE, have shed doubt on the classical notion that the Mesopotamian symbol system predates the Egyptian one. However, Egyptian writing appeared suddenly at that time, while Mesopotamia had a long evolutionary history of sign usage in tokens dating back to circa 8000 BCE.\\"The seal impressions, from various tombs, date even further back, to 3400 B.C. These dates challenge the commonly held belief that early logographs, pictographic symbols representing a specific place, object, or quantity, first evolved into more complex phonetic symbols in Mesopotamia.\\" Hieroglyphs became the inspiration for the original alphabet that was ancestral to nearly all others, including the Latin alphabet.

Seal impression of Seth-Peribsen (Second Dynasty, c. 28-27th century BC) =Mature writing system= Hieroglyphs consist of three kinds of glyphs: phonetic glyphs, including single-consonant characters that function like an alphabet; logographs, representing morphemes; and determinatives, which narrow down the meaning of logographic or phonetic words. Hieroglyphs on stela in Louvre, circa 1321 BC =Late Period= As writing developed and became more widespread among the Egyptian people, simplified glyph forms developed, resulting in the hieratic (priestly) and demotic (popular) scripts. These variants were also more suited than hieroglyphs for use on papyrus. Hieroglyphic writing was not, however, eclipsed, but existed alongside the other forms, especially in monumental and other formal writing. The Rosetta Stone contains three parallel scripts ‚Äì hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek. =Late survival= Hieroglyphs continued to be used under Persian rule (intermittent in the 6th and 5th centuries BC), and after Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt, during the ensuing Ptolemaic and Roman periods. It appears that the misleading quality of comments from Greek and Roman writers about hieroglyphs came about, at least in part, as a response to the changed political situation. Some believed that hieroglyphs may have functioned as a way to distinguish 'true Egyptians' from some of the foreign conquerors. Another reason may be the refusal to tackle a foreign culture on its own terms, which characterized Greco-Roman approaches to Egyptian culture generally. Having learned that hieroglyphs were sacred writing, Greco-Roman authors imagined the complex but rational system as an allegorical, even magical, system transmitting secret, mystical knowledge. By the 4th century AD, few Egyptians were capable of reading hieroglyphs, and the \\"myth of allegorical hieroglyphs\\" was ascendant. Monumental use of hieroglyphs ceased after the closing of all non-Christian temples in 391 by the Roman Emperor Theodosius I; the last known inscription is from Philae, known as the Graffito of Esmet-Akhom, from 394.The latest presently known hieroglyphic inscription date: Birthday of Osiris, year 110 [of Diocletian], dated to August 24, 394 The Hieroglyphica of Horapollo (c. 5th century) appears to retain some genuine knowledge about the writing system. It offers an explanation of close to 200 signs. Some are identified correctly, such as the \\"goose\\" hieroglyph (zÍú£) representing the word for \\"son\\". A half-dozen Demotic glyphs are still in use, added to the Greek alphabet when writing Coptic. Decipherment Ibn Wahshiyya's translation of the Ancient Egyptian hieroglyph alphabet Knowledge of the hieroglyphs had been lost completely by the medieval period. Early attempts at decipherment are due to Dhul-Nun al- Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya (9th and 10th century, respectively). All medieval and early modern attempts were hampered by the fundamental assumption that hieroglyphs recorded ideas and not the sounds of the language. As no bilingual texts were available, any such symbolic 'translation' could be proposed without the possibility of verification. It was not until Athanasius Kircher in the mid 17th century that scholars began to think the hieroglyphs might also represent sounds. Kircher was familiar with Coptic, and thought that it might be the key to deciphering the hieroglyphs, but was held back by a belief in the mystical nature of the symbols. The Rosetta Stone in the British Museum The breakthrough in decipherment came only with the discovery of the Rosetta Stone by Napoleon's troops in 1799 (during Napoleon's Egyptian invasion). As the stone presented a hieroglyphic and a demotic version of the same text in parallel with a Greek translation, plenty of material for falsifiable studies in translation was suddenly available. In the early 19th century, scholars such as Silvestre de Sacy, Johan David √Ökerblad, and Thomas Young studied the inscriptions on the stone, and were able to make some headway. Finally, Jean- Fran√ßois Champollion made the complete decipherment by the 1820s. In his Lettre √† M. Dacier (1822), he wrote: > It is a complex system, writing figurative, symbolic, and phonetic all at > once, in the same text, the same phrase, I would almost say in the same > word.Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion, Letter to M. Dacier, September 27, 1822 Illustration from Tabula Aegyptiaca hieroglyphicis exornata published in Acta Eruditorum, 1714 Writing system Visually, hieroglyphs are all more or less figurative: they represent real or abstract elements, sometimes stylized and simplified, but all generally perfectly recognizable in form. However, the same sign can, according to context, be interpreted in diverse ways: as a phonogram (phonetic reading), as a logogram, or as an ideogram (semagram; \\"determinative\\") (semantic reading). The determinative was not read as a phonetic constituent, but facilitated understanding by differentiating the word from its homophones. =Phonetic reading= Hieroglyphs typical of the Graeco-Roman period Most non-determinative hieroglyphic signs are phonograms, whose meaning is determined by pronunciation, independent of visual characteristics. This follows the rebus principle where, for example, the picture of an eye could stand not only for the English word eye, but also for its phonetic equivalent, the first person pronoun I. Phonograms formed with one consonant are called uniliteral signs; with two consonants, biliteral signs; with three, triliteral signs. Twenty-four uniliteral signs make up the so-called hieroglyphic alphabet. Egyptian hieroglyphic writing does not normally indicate vowels, unlike cuneiform, and for that reason has been labelled by some an abjad alphabet, i.e., an alphabet without vowels. Thus, hieroglyphic writing representing a pintail duck is read in Egyptian as sÍú£, derived from the main consonants of the Egyptian word for this duck: 's', 'Íú£' and 't'. (Note that Íú£ or , two half-rings opening to the left, sometimes replaced by the digit '3', is the Egyptian alef.) It is also possible to use the hieroglyph of the pintail duck without a link to its meaning in order to represent the two phonemes s and Íú£, independently of any vowels that could accompany these consonants, and in this way write the word: sÍú£, \\"son\\"; or when complemented by other signs detailed below sÍú£, \\"keep, watch\\"; and sÍú£·πØ.w, \\"hard ground\\". For example: G38the characters sÍú£; G38-Z1sthe same character used only in order to signify, according to the context, \\"pintail duck\\" or, with the appropriate determinative, \\"son\\", two words having the same or similar consonants; the meaning of the little vertical stroke will be explained further on: z:G38-A-A47-D54the character sÍú£ as used in the word sÍú£w, \\"keep, watch\\" As in the Arabic script, not all vowels were written in Egyptian hieroglyphs; it is debatable whether vowels were written at all. Possibly, as with Arabic, the semivowels and (as in English W and Y) could double as the vowels and . In modern transcriptions, an e is added between consonants to aid in their pronunciation. For example, nfr \\"good\\" is typically written nefer. This does not reflect Egyptian vowels, which are obscure, but is merely a modern convention. Likewise, the Íú£ and  æ are commonly transliterated as a, as in Ra. Hieroglyphs are written from right to left, from left to right, or from top to bottom, the usual direction being from right to leftSir Alan H. Gardiner, Egyptian Grammar, Third Edition Revised, Griffith Institute (2005), p.25 (although, for convenience, modern texts are often normalized into left- to-right order). To determine the proper reading order of a text, the reader must consider the direction in which the asymmetrical hieroglyphs are turned. For example, human and animal hieroglyphs face or look toward the beginning of their line: i.e. if they look left, they must be read from left to right, and vice versa. As in many ancient writing systems, words are not separated by blanks or punctuation marks. However, certain hieroglyphs appear particularly common only at the end of words, making it possible to readily distinguish words. Uniliteral signs Hieroglyphs at Amada, at temple founded by Tuthmosis III The Egyptian hieroglyphic script contained 24 uniliterals (symbols that stood for single consonants, much like letters in English). It would have been possible to write all Egyptian words in the manner of these signs, but the Egyptians never did so and never simplified their complex writing into a true alphabet. Each uniliteral glyph once had a unique reading, but several of these fell together as Old Egyptian developed into Middle Egyptian. For example, the folded-cloth glyph seems to have been originally an /s/ and the door-bolt glyph a /Œ∏/ sound, but these both came to be pronounced , as the sound was lost. A few uniliterals first appear in Middle Egyptian texts. Besides the uniliteral glyphs, there are also the biliteral and triliteral signs, to represent a specific sequence of two or three consonants, consonants and vowels, and a few as vowel combinations only, in the language. Phonetic complements Egyptian writing is often redundant: in fact, it happens very frequently that a word is followed by several characters writing the same sounds, in order to guide the reader. For example, the word nfr, \\"beautiful, good, perfect\\", was written with a unique triliteral that was read as nfr: ::::::::: nfr However, it is considerably more common to add to that triliteral, the uniliterals for f and r. The word can thus be written as nfr+f+r, but one still reads it merely as nfr. The two alphabetic characters are adding clarity to the spelling of the preceding triliteral hieroglyph. Redundant characters accompanying biliteral or triliteral signs are called phonetic complements (or complementaries). They can be placed in front of the sign (rarely), after the sign (as a general rule), or even framing it (appearing both before and after). Ancient Egyptian scribes consistently avoided leaving large areas of blank space in their writing, and might add additional phonetic complements or sometimes even invert the order of signs if this would result in a more aesthetically pleasing appearance (good scribes attended to the artistic, and even religious, aspects of the hieroglyphs, and would not simply view them as a communication tool). Various examples of the use of phonetic complements can be seen below: > : S43-d-w ‚Äì md +d +w (the complementary d is placed after the sign) ‚Üí it > reads mdw, meaning \\"tongue\\". : x:p-xpr:r-i-A40 ‚Äì ·∏´ +p +·∏´pr +r +j (the four > complementaries frame the triliteral sign of the scarab beetle) ‚Üí it reads > ·∏´pr.j, meaning the name \\"Khepri\\", with the final glyph being the > determinative for 'ruler or god'. Notably, phonetic complements were also used to allow the reader to differentiate between signs that are homophones, or which do not always have a unique reading. For example, the symbol of \\"the seat\\" (or chair): > : Q1 ‚Äì This can be read st, ws and ·∏•tm, according to the word in which it is > found. The presence of phonetic complements‚Äîand of the suitable > determinative‚Äîallows the reader to know which of the three readings to > choose: :*1st Reading: st ‚Äì Q1-t:pr ‚Äì st, written st+t; the last character > is the determinative of \\"the house\\" or that which is found there, meaning > \\"seat, throne, place\\"; ::: Q1-t:H8 ‚Äì st (written st+t; the \\"egg\\" > determinative is used for female personal names in some periods), meaning > \\"Isis\\"; :*2nd Reading: ws ‚Äì Q1:ir-A40 ‚Äì wsjr (written ws+jr, with, as a > phonetic complement, \\"the eye\\", which is read jr, following the > determinative of \\"god\\"), meaning \\"Osiris\\"; :*3rd Reading: ·∏•tm ‚Äì H-Q1-m:t-E17 > ‚Äì ·∏•tm.t (written ·∏•+·∏•tm+m+t, with the determinative of \\"Anubis\\" or \\"the > jackal\\"), meaning a kind of wild animal; ::: H-Q1-t-G41 ‚Äì ·∏•tm (written ·∏• > +·∏•tm +t, with the determinative of the flying bird), meaning \\"to disappear\\". Finally, it sometimes happens that the pronunciation of words might be changed because of their connection to Ancient Egyptian: in this case, it is not rare for writing to adopt a compromise in notation, the two readings being indicated jointly. For example, the adjective bnj, \\"sweet\\", became bnr. In Middle Egyptian, one can write: ::: b-n:r-i-M30 ‚Äì bnrj (written b+n+r+i, with determinative) which is fully read as bnr, the j not being pronounced but retained in order to keep a written connection with the ancient word (in the same fashion as the English language words through, knife, or victuals, which are no longer pronounced the way they are written.) =Semantic reading= Comparative evolution from pictograms to abstract shapes, in cuneiform, Egyptian and Chinese characters Besides a phonetic interpretation, characters can also be read for their meaning: in this instance, logograms are being spoken (or ideograms) and semagrams (the latter are also called determinatives).Antonio Loprieno, Ancient Egyptian, A Linguistic Introduction, Cambridge University Press (1995), p. 13 Logograms A hieroglyph used as a logogram defines the object of which it is an image. Logograms are therefore the most frequently used common nouns; they are always accompanied by a mute vertical stroke indicating their status as a logogram (the usage of a vertical stroke is further explained below); in theory, all hieroglyphs would have the ability to be used as logograms. Logograms can be accompanied by phonetic complements. Here are some examples: :*ra:Z1 ‚Äì rÍú•, meaning \\"sun\\"; :*pr:Z1 ‚Äì pr, meaning \\"house\\"; :*sw-t:Z1 ‚Äì swt (sw+t), meaning \\"reed\\"; :*Dw:Z1 ‚Äì ·∏èw, meaning \\"mountain\\". In some cases, the semantic connection is indirect (metonymic or metaphoric): :*nTr-Z1 ‚Äì n·πØr, meaning \\"god\\"; the character in fact represents a temple flag (standard); :*G53-Z1 ‚Äì bÍú£, meaning \\"B√¢\\" (soul); the character is the traditional representation of a \\"b√¢\\" (a bird with a human head); :*G27-Z1 ‚Äì d≈°r, meaning \\"flamingo\\"; the corresponding phonogram means \\"red\\" and the bird is associated by metonymy with this color. Determinatives Determinatives or semagrams (semantic symbols specifying meaning) are placed at the end of a word. These mute characters serve to clarify what the word is about, as homophonic glyphs are common. If a similar procedure existed in English, words with the same spelling would be followed by an indicator that would not be read, but which would fine-tune the meaning: \\"retort [chemistry]\\" and \\"retort [rhetoric]\\" would thus be distinguished. A number of determinatives exist: divinities, humans, parts of the human body, animals, plants, etc. Certain determinatives possess a literal and a figurative meaning. For example, a roll of papyrus, Y1 is used to define \\"books\\" but also abstract ideas. The determinative of the plural is a shortcut to signal three occurrences of the word, that is to say, its plural (since the Egyptian language had a dual, sometimes indicated by two strokes). This special character is explained below. Extract from the Tale of the Two Brothers. Here, are several examples of the use of determinatives borrowed from the book, Je lis les hi√©roglyphes (\\"I am reading hieroglyphs\\") by Jean Capart, which illustrate their importance: *nfr- w-A17-Z3 ‚Äì nfrw (w and the three strokes are the marks of the plural): [literally] \\"the beautiful young people\\", that is to say, the young military recruits. The word has a young-person determinative symbol: A17 ‚Äì which is the determinative indicating babies and children; *nfr-f:r:t-B1 ‚Äì nfr.t (.t is here the suffix that forms the feminine): meaning \\"the nubile young woman\\", with B1 as the determinative indicating a woman; *nfr-nfr-nfr-pr ‚Äì nfrw (the tripling of the character serving to express the plural, flexional ending w) : meaning \\"foundations (of a house)\\", with the house as a determinative, pr; *nfr-f:r-S28 ‚Äì nfr : meaning \\"clothing\\" with S28 as the determinative for lengths of cloth; *nfr-W22:Z2ss ‚Äì nfr : meaning \\"wine\\" or \\"beer\\"; with a jug W22 as the determinative. All these words have a meliorative connotation: \\"good, beautiful, perfect\\". The Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian by Raymond A. Faulkner, gives some twenty words that are read nfr or which are formed from this word. =Additional signs= Cartouche Egyptian hieroglyphs with cartouches for the name Ramesses II, from the Luxor Temple, New Kingdom Rarely, the names of gods are placed within a cartouche; the two last names of the sitting king are always placed within a cartouche: < N5:Z1-i-Y5:n-A40 > jmn-rÍú•, \\"Amon-Ra\\"; < q:E23-i-V4-p:d:r-A-t:H8 > qljwÍú£pdrÍú£.t, \\"Cleopatra\\"; Filling stroke A filling stroke is a character indicating the end of a quadrat that would otherwise be incomplete. =Signs joined together= Some signs are the contraction of several others. These signs have, however, a function and existence of their own: for example, a forearm where the hand holds a scepter is used as a determinative for words meaning \\"to direct, to drive\\" and their derivatives. Doubling The doubling of a sign indicates its dual; the tripling of a sign indicates its plural. =Grammatical signs= *The vertical stroke indicates that the sign is a logogram. *Two strokes indicate the dual number, and the three strokes the plural. *The direct notation of flexional endings, for example: W Spelling Standard orthography‚Äî\\"correct\\" spelling‚Äîin Egyptian is much looser than in modern languages. In fact, one or several variants exist for almost every word. One finds: *Redundancies; *Omission of graphemes, which are ignored whether or not they are intentional; *Substitutions of one grapheme for another, such that it is impossible to distinguish a \\"mistake\\" from an \\"alternate spelling\\"; *Errors of omission in the drawing of signs, which are much more problematic when the writing is cursive (hieratic) writing, but especially demotic, where the schematization of the signs is extreme. However, many of these apparent spelling errors constitute an issue of chronology. Spelling and standards varied over time, so the writing of a word during the Old Kingdom might be considerably different during the New Kingdom. Furthermore, the Egyptians were perfectly content to include older orthography (\\"historical spelling\\") alongside newer practices, as though it were acceptable in English to use archaic spellings in modern texts. Most often, ancient \\"spelling errors\\" are simply misinterpretations of context. Today, hieroglyphicists use numerous cataloguing systems (notably the Manuel de Codage and Gardiner's Sign List) to clarify the presence of determinatives, ideograms, and other ambiguous signs in transliteration. Simple examples The glyphs in this cartouche are transliterated as: {- style=\\"vertical- align:middle;\\" border=\\"0\\" p t \\"ua\\" l m y (ii) s  Ptolmys } though ii is considered a single letter and transliterated y. Another way in which hieroglyphs work is illustrated by the two Egyptian words pronounced pr (usually vocalised as per). One word is 'house', and its hieroglyphic representation is straightforward: pr:Z1 Name of Alexander the Great in hieroglyphs, , Egypt. Louvre Museum Here, the 'house' hieroglyph works as a logogram: it represents the word with a single sign. The vertical stroke below the hieroglyph is a common way of indicating that a glyph is working as a logogram. Another word pr is the verb 'to go out, leave'. When this word is written, the 'house' hieroglyph is used as a phonetic symbol: pr:r-D54 Here, the 'house' glyph stands for the consonants pr. The 'mouth' glyph below it is a phonetic complement: it is read as r, reinforcing the phonetic reading of pr. The third hieroglyph is a determinative: it is an ideogram for verbs of motion that gives the reader an idea of the meaning of the word. Encoding and font support Egyptian hieroglyphs were added to the Unicode Standard in October 2009 with the release of version 5.2 which introduced the Egyptian Hieroglyphs block (U+13000‚ÄìU+1342F) with 1,071 defined characters. , four fonts, Aegyptus, NewGardiner, Noto Sans Egyptian Hieroglyphs and JSeshFont support this range. Another font, Segoe UI Historic, comes bundled with Windows 10 and also contains glyphs for the Egyptian Hieroglyphs block. Segoe UI Historic excludes three glyphs depicting phallus ( Gardiner's D52, D52A D53, Unicode code points U+130B8‚ÄìU+130BA).

In law a witness is someone who, either voluntarily or under compulsion, provides testimonial evidence, either oral or written, of what he or she knows or claims to know. A percipient witness (or eyewitness) is one with knowledge obtained through his or her own senses (e.g., visual perception, hearing, smell, touch). That perception might be either with the unaided human sense or with the aid of an instrument, such as microscope or stethoscope. A hearsay witness is one who testifies about what someone else said or wrote. In most court proceedings there are many limitations on when hearsay evidence is admissible. Such limitations do not apply to grand jury investigations, many administrative proceedings, and may not apply to declarations used in support of an arrest or search warrant. Also some types of statements are not deemed to be hearsay and are not subject to such limitations. An expert witness is one who allegedly has specialized knowledge relevant to the matter of interest, which knowledge purportedly helps to either make sense of other evidence, including other testimony, documentary evidence or physical evidence (e.g., a fingerprint). An expert witness may or may not also be a percipient witness, as in a doctor or may or may not have treated the victim of an accident or crime. A reputation witness is one who testifies about the reputation of a person or business entity, when reputation is material to the dispute at issue. Such a witness is someone who testifies that because of a person's interactions and personality the defendant is likely to be guilty/innocent In law a witness might be compelled to provide testimony in court, before a grand jury, before an administrative tribunal, before a deposition officer, or in a variety of other legal proceedings. A subpoena is a legal document that commands a person to appear at a proceeding. It is used to compel the testimony of a witness in a trial. Usually, it can be issued by a judge or by the lawyer representing the plaintiff or the defendant in a civil trial or by the prosecutor or the defense attorney in a criminal proceeding, or by a government agency. In many jurisdictions, it is compulsory to comply and with the subpoena and either take an oath or solemely affirm to testify truthfully under penalty of perjury. Although informally a witness includes whoever perceived the event, in law, a witness is different from an informant. A confidential informant is someone who claimed to have witnessed an event or have hearsay information, but whose identity is being withheld from at least one party (typically the criminal defendant). The information from the confidential informant may have been used by a police officer or other official acting as a hearsay witness to obtain a search warrant. Court procedure = Calling a witness = as a witness during the Nuremberg Trials In a court proceeding, a witness may be called (requested to testify) by either the prosecution or the defense. The side that calls the witness first asks questions in what is called direct examination. The opposing side then may ask their own questions in what is called cross-examination. In some cases, redirect examination may be used by the side that called the witness but usually only to contradict specific testimony from the cross-examination. Recalling a witness means calling a witness, who has already given testimony in a proceeding, to give further testimony. A court may give leave to a party to recall a witness only to give evidence about a matter adduced by another party if the second party's testimony contradicts evidence given by the original witness on direct examination. =Testimony= Witnesses are usually permitted to testify only what they experienced first-hand. In most cases, they may not testify about something they were told (hearsay). That restriction does not apply to expert witnesses, but they may testify only in the area of their expertise. Reliability Eyewitness testimony is generally presumed to be more reliable than circumstantial evidence. Studies have shown, however, that individual, separate witness testimony is often flawed, and parts of it can be meaningless. That can occur because of flaws in eyewitness identification (such as faulty observation and recollection, or bias) or because a witness is lying. If several people witness a crime, it is probative to look for similarities in their collective descriptions to substantiate the facts of an event but to keep in mind the contrasts between individual descriptions. One study involved an experiment, in which subjects acted as jurors in a criminal case. Jurors heard a description of a robbery-murder, a prosecution argument, and then an argument for the defense. Some jurors heard only circumstantial evidence; others heard from a clerk who claimed to identify the defendant. In the former case, 18% percent found the defendant guilty, but in the latter case, 72% found the defendant guilty (Loftus 1988). Police lineups in which the eyewitness picks out a suspect from a group of people in the police station are often grossly suggestive, and they give the false impression that the witness remembered the suspect. In another study, students watched a staged crime. An hour later they looked through photos. A week later they were asked to pick the suspect out of lineups. 8% of the people in the lineups were mistakenly identified as criminals. 20% of the innocent people whose photographs were included were mistakenly identified (University of Nebraska 1977). Weapon focus effects in which the presence of a weapon impairs memory for surrounding details is also an issue. Another study looked at 65 cases of \\"erroneous criminal convictions of innocent people.\\" In 45% of the cases, eyewitness mistakes were responsible.Convicting the Innocent: Sixty-Five Actual Errors of Criminal Justice by Borchard, pg 367 The formal study of eyewitness memory is usually undertaken within the broader category of cognitive processes, the different ways in which we make sense of the world around us. That is done by employing the mental skills at one's disposal like thinking, perception, memory, awareness, reasoning, and judgment. Although cognitive processes can be only inferred and cannot be seen directly, they all have very important practical implications within a legal context. If one were to accept that the way people think, perceive, reason, and judge is not always perfect, it becomes easier to understand why cognitive processes and the factors influencing the processes are studied by psychologists in matters of law, one being the grave implications that this imperfection can have within the criminal justice system. The study of witness memory has dominated the realm of investigation. As Huff and Rattner note, the single most important factor contributing to wrongful conviction is eyewitness misidentification. Credibility Several factors affect witnesses' credibility. Generally, they are deemed to be credible if they are recognized (or can be recognized) as a source of reliable information about someone, an event, or a phenomenon. As an example, the 2009 arrest of an illegal immigrant from El Salvador in the murder of federal intern Chandra Levy saw many questions arise surrounding the credibility of various witnesses. Contesting the credibility of so-called \\"expert\\" witnesses rose into more common practice in the 1860s and 1870s.

Italian neorealism films mostly contend with the difficult economic and moral conditions of post-World War II Italy, representing changes in the Italian psyche and conditions of everyday life, including poverty, oppression, injustice, and desperation.  History  Italian neorealism came about as World War II ended and Benito Mussolini's government fell, causing the Italian film industry to lose its centre. Neorealism was a sign of cultural change and social progress in Italy. Its films presented contemporary stories and ideas and were often shot in streets as the Cinecitt√† film studios had been damaged significantly during the war. The neorealist style was developed by a circle of film critics that revolved around the magazine Cinema, including: * Luchino Visconti * Gianni Puccini * Cesare Zavattini * Giuseppe De Santis * Pietro Ingrao Largely prevented from writing about politics (the editor-in-chief of the magazine was Vittorio Mussolini, son of Benito Mussolini), the critics attacked the Telefoni Bianchi films that dominated the industry at the time. As a counter to the popular mainstream films, some critics felt that Italian cinema should turn to the realist writers from the turn of the 20th century. Wandering Musicians by Italian neorealist artist Bruno Caruso (1953) Both Antonioni and Visconti had worked closely with Jean Renoir. In addition, many of the filmmakers involved in neorealism developed their skills working on Calligrafismo films (though the short-lived movement was markedly different from neorealism). Elements of neorealism are also found in the films of Alessandro Blasetti and the documentary-style films of Francesco De Robertis. Two of the most significant precursors of neorealism are Jean Renoir's Toni (1935) and Alessandro Blasetti's 1860 (1934). In the spring of 1945, Mussolini was executed and Italy was liberated from German occupation. This period, known as the \\"Italian Spring,\\" was a break from old ways and an entrance to a more realistic approach when making films. Italian cinema went from utilizing elaborate studio sets to shooting on location in the countryside and city streets in the realist style.Thompson, Kristin. Bordwell, David. \\"Film History: An Introduction, Third Edition\\". McGraw Hill. 2010, p.330-331. Although the true beginning of neorealism has been widely contested by theorists and filmmakers, the first neorealist film is generally thought to be Ossessione by Luchino Visconti (1943). Neorealism became famous globally in 1946 with Roberto Rossellini's Rome, Open City, when it won the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival as the first major film produced in Italy after the war. Italian neorealism rapidly declined in the early 1950s. Liberal and socialist parties were having difficulties presenting their message. The vision of the existing poverty and despair, presented by neorealist cinema, was demoralizing a nation anxious for prosperity and change. Additionally, the first positive effects of the Italian economic miracle period ‚Äì such as gradual rises in income levels ‚Äì caused the themes of neorealism to lose their relevance. As a consequence, most Italians favored the optimism shown in many American movies of the time. The views of the post-war Italian government of the time were also far from positive, and the remark of Giulio Andreotti, who was then a vice-minister in the De Gasperi cabinet, characterized the official view of the movement: Neorealism is \\"dirty laundry that shouldn't be washed and hung to dry in the open\\". Italy's move from individual concern with neorealism to the tragic frailty of the human condition can be seen through Federico Fellini's films. His early works La Strada (1954) and Il bidone (1955) are transitional movies. The larger social concerns of humanity, treated by neorealists, gave way to the exploration of individuals. Their needs, their alienation from society and their tragic failure to communicate became the main focal point in the Italian films to follow in the 1960s. Similarly, Antonioni's Red Desert (1964) and Blow-up (1966) take the neorealist trappings and internalise them in the suffering and search for knowledge brought out by Italy's post-war economic and political climate. In the early 1950s the neorealist torch was picked up by artists like Sicily's Bruno Caruso, whose work focused on the warehouses, shipyards and psychiatric wards of his native Palermo.https://bruno-caruso.com/ink-oils- archive#neoink/Bruno Caruso - Italian Neorealist Ink Drawings  Characteristics  Bicycle Thieves (1948) Neorealist films were generally filmed with nonprofessional actors, although in a number of cases, well-known actors were cast in leading roles, playing strongly against their normal character types in front of a background populated by local people rather than extras brought in for the film. They were shot almost exclusively on location, mostly in rundown cities as well as rural areas due to its forming during the post-war era. Neorealist films typically explore the conditions of the poor and the lower working class. Characters oftentimes exist within simple social order where survival is the primary objective. Performances are mostly constructed from scenes of people performing fairly mundane and quotidian activities, devoid of the self-consciousness that amateur acting usually entails. Neorealist films often feature children in major roles, though their characters are frequently more observational than participatory. Open City established several of the principles of neorealism, depicting clearly the struggle of normal Italian people to live from day to day under the extraordinary difficulties of the German occupation of Rome, consciously doing what they can to resist the occupation. The children play a key role in this, and their presence at the end of the film is indicative of their role in neorealism as a whole: as observers of the difficulties of today who hold the key to the future. Vittorio De Sica's 1948 film Bicycle Thieves is also representative of the genre, with non-professional actors, and a story that details the hardships of working-class life after the war. In the period from 1944‚Äì1948, many neorealist filmmakers drifted away from pure neorealism. Some directors explored allegorical fantasy, such as de Sica's Miracle in Milan, and historical spectacle, like Senso by Visconti. It was also the time period when a more upbeat neorealism emerged, which produced films that melded working-class characters with 1930s-style populist comedy, as seen in de Sica's Umberto D.Bordwell, David. Thompson, Kristin. Film History: An Introduction. Postwar European Cinema: Neorealism and Its Context, 1945-1959. Pg. 333 At the height of neorealism, in 1948, Visconti adapted I Malavoglia, a novel by Giovanni Verga, written at the height of the 19th century realist verismo movement (in many ways the basis for neorealism, which is therefore sometimes referred to as neoverismo), bringing the story to a modern setting, which resulted in remarkably little change in either the plot or the tone. The resulting film, The Earth Trembles, starred only nonprofessional actors and was filmed in the same village (Aci Trezza) in which the novel was set. More contemporary theorists of Italian neorealism characterize it less as a consistent set of stylistic characteristics and more as the relationship between film practice and the social reality of post-war Italy. Millicent Marcus delineates the lack of consistent film styles of neorealist film.Marcus, Italian Film in the Light of Neorealism (Princeton University Press, 1987) ). Peter Brunette and Marcia Landy both deconstruct the use of reworked cinematic forms in Rossellini's Open City.Brunette Roberto Rosellini (Oxford University Press, 1987) and Landy \\"Diverting clich√©s: femininity, masculinity, melodrama, and neorealism in Open City\\" in Roberto Rosellini's Rome Open City (Cambridge University Press, 2004) ). Using psychoanalysis, Vincent Rocchio characterizes neorealist film as consistently engendering the structure of anxiety into the structure of the plot itself.Rocchio, Cinema of Anxiety: A Psychoanalysis of Italian Neorealism (UT Press, 1999).  Impact  The period between 1943 and 1950 in the history of Italian cinema is dominated by the impact of neorealism, which is properly defined as a moment or a trend in Italian film rather than an actual school or group of theoretically motivated and like-minded directors and scriptwriters. Its impact nevertheless has been enormous not only on Italian film but also on French New Wave cinema, the Polish Film School and ultimately on films all over the world. It also influenced film directors of India's Parallel Cinema movement, including Satyajit Ray (who directed the award-winning Apu Trilogy) and Bimal Roy (who made Do Bigha Zameen [1953]), both heavily influenced by Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948). Furthermore, as some critics have argued, the abandoning of the classical way of doing cinema and so the starting point of the Nouvelle Vague and the Modern Cinema can be found in the post-war Italian cinema and in the neorealism experiences. In particular, > this cinema seems to be constituted as a new subject of knowledge, which it > self builds and develops. It produces a new world in which the main elements > have not so many narrative functions as they have their own aesthetic value, > related with the eye that is watching them and not with the action they are > coming from. The Neorealist period is often simply referred to as \\"The Golden Age\\" of Italian cinema by critics, filmmakers and scholars.  Significant works  = Precursors and influences = The extent to which Italian neorealism was truly innovative continues to be debated among film historians. Despite its wide influence, some have argued that it was more a revival of earlier Italian creative works than a groundbreaking movement.

Her contemporary folk music often includes songs of protest or social justice.Jackson, Ernie. \\"Folk Guitarists\\". Joelma The Everything Guitar Book Joelma. F+W Publications Inc., 2007. Print. Baez has performed publicly for over 60 years, releasing over 30 albums. Fluent in Spanish and English, she has also recorded songs in at least six other languages. Baez is generally regarded as a folk singer, but her music has diversified since the counterculture era of the 1960s and encompasses genres such as folk rock, pop, country and gospel music. She began her recording career in 1960 and achieved immediate success. Her first three albums, Joan Baez, Joan Baez, Vol. 2 and Joan Baez in Concert, all achieved gold record status. Although a songwriter herself, Baez generally interprets other composers' work, having recorded songs by the Allman Brothers Band, the Beatles, Jackson Browne, Leonard Cohen, Woody Guthrie, Violeta Parra, the Rolling Stones, Pete Seeger, Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder, Bob Marley, and many others. She was one of the first major artists to record the songs of Bob Dylan in the early 1960s; Baez was already an internationally celebrated artist and did much to popularize his early songwriting efforts. On her later albums she has found success interpreting the work of more recent songwriters, including Ryan Adams, Josh Ritter, Steve Earle, Natalie Merchant and Joe Henry. Baez's acclaimed songs include \\"Diamonds & Rust\\" and covers of Phil Ochs's \\"There but for Fortune\\" and The Band's \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\". She is also known for \\"Farewell, Angelina\\", \\"Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word\\", \\"Forever Young\\", \\"Here's to You\\", \\"Joe Hill\\", \\"Sweet Sir Galahad\\" and \\"We Shall Overcome\\". Baez performed fourteen songs at the 1969 Woodstock Festival and has displayed a lifelong commitment to political and social activism in the fields of nonviolence, civil rights, human rights and the environment. Baez was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 7, 2017. Early life Baez was born on Staten Island, New York, on January 9, 1941. Joan's grandfather, the Reverend Alberto Baez, left the Catholic Church to become a Methodist minister and moved to the U.S. when her father was two years old.

Born in April 1913, she died on April 20, 2013. Baez had two sisters ‚Äì Pauline Thalia Baez Bryan (1938‚Äì2016), who was sometimes professionally known as Pauline Marden; and Margarita Mimi Baez Fari√±a (1945‚Äì2001) who was generally better known as Mimi Fari√±a. To varying degrees, both women were also political activists and musicians like their sister. They are also notable for having been married to other American artists ‚Äì Pauline (briefly) to painter Brice Marden and Mimi to author and musician Richard Fari√±a with whom she collaborated for several years. The Baez family converted to Quakerism during Joan's early childhood, and she has continued to identify with the tradition, particularly in her commitment to pacifism and social issues. While growing up, Baez was subjected to racial slurs and discrimination due to her Mexican heritage. Consequently, she became involved with a variety of social causes early in her career. She declined to play in any white student venues that were segregated, which meant that when she toured the Southern states, she would play only at black colleges. Due to her father's work with UNESCO, their family moved many times, living in towns across the U.S, as well as in England, France, Switzerland, Spain, Canada, and the Middle East, including Iraq.

Music career The opening line of Baez's memoir And a Voice to Sing With is \\"I was born gifted\\" (referencing her singing voice, which she explained was given to her and for which she can take no credit). A friend of Joan's father gave her a ukulele. She learned four chords, which enabled her to play rhythm and blues, the music she was listening to at the time. Her parents, however, were fearful that the music would lead her into a life of drug addiction.Democracy Now, May 4, 2009 (transcript). Interview with Joan Baez, by Amy Goodman at Pete Seeger's 90th birthday celebration. When Baez was 13, her aunt and her aunt's boyfriend took her to a concert by folk musician Pete Seeger, and Baez found herself strongly moved by his music.Hajdu, David. Positively Fourth Street: The Lives and Times of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Mimi Baez Fari√±a and Richard Fari√±a (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2001). The passage about that Pete Seeger concert's effect on Baez starts on p. 7 of the book. The concert was in 1954 at Palo Alto High School. It was a fundraiser for the California Democratic Party. She soon began practicing the songs of his repertoire and performing them publicly. One of her very earliest public performances was at a retreat in Saratoga, California, for a youth group from Temple Beth Jacob, a Redwood City, California, Jewish congregation. A few years later in 1957, Baez bought her first Gibson acoustic guitar. =College music scene in Massachusetts= In 1958, after Baez graduated from high school, her father accepted a faculty position at MIT, and moved his family from the San Francisco area to Boston, Massachusetts. At that time, it was in the center of the up-and-coming folk-music scene, and Baez began performing near home in Boston and nearby Cambridge. She also performed in clubs, and attended Boston University for about six weeks. In 1958, at the Club 47 in Cambridge, she gave her first concert. When designing the poster for the performance, Baez considered changing her performing name to either Rachel Sandperl, the surname of her long-time mentor, Ira Sandperl, or Maria from the song \\"They Call the Wind Maria\\". She later opted against doing so, fearing that people would accuse her of changing her last name because it was Spanish. The audience consisted of her parents, her sister Mimi, her boyfriend, and a few friends, resulting in a total of eight patrons. She was paid ten dollars. Baez was later asked back and began performing twice a week for $25 per show. A few months later, Baez and two other folk enthusiasts made plans to record an album in the cellar of a friend's house. The three sang solos and duets, a family friend designed the album cover, and it was released on Veritas Records that same year as Folksingers 'Round Harvard Square. Baez later met Bob Gibson and Odetta, who were at the time two of the most prominent vocalists singing folk and gospel music. Baez cites Odetta as a primary influence along with Marian Anderson and Pete Seeger.Baez, Joan. And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2009, p. 43 Gibson invited Baez to perform with him at the 1959 Newport Folk Festival, where the two sang two duets, \\"Virgin Mary Had One Son\\" and \\"We Are Crossing Jordan River\\". The performance generated substantial praise for the \\"barefoot Madonna\\" with the otherworldly voice, and it was this appearance that led to Baez signing with Vanguard Records the following year although Columbia Records tried to sign her first.Baez, Joan (1987). And A Voice to Sing With, pp 61‚Äì62. Baez describes the afternoon when she met with first Mitch Miller at Columbia, then Maynard Solomon at Vanguard. Baez later claimed that she felt she would be given more artistic license at a more \\"low key\\" label. Baez's nickname at the time, \\"Madonna\\", has been attributed to her clear voice, long hair, and natural beauty,Abbe A. Debolt, James S. Baugess ‚Äì The Encyclopedia of the Sixties: A Decade of Culture 1440801029 Page 48 \\"She received the nickname \\"Madonna\\" because of the soulful clarity of her soprano voice, long hair, and natural beauty.\\" and to her role as \\"Earth Mother\\".Terrie M.

Following that appearance, she recorded her first album for Vanguard, Joan Baez (1960), produced by Fred Hellerman of The Weavers, who produced many albums by folk artists. The collection of traditional folk ballads, blues, and laments sung to her own guitar accompaniment sold moderately well. It featured many popular Child Ballads of the day and was recorded in only four days in the ballroom of New York City's Manhattan Towers Hotel. The album also included \\"El Preso Numero Nueve\\", a song sung entirely in Spanish, which she would re-record in 1974 for inclusion on her Spanish-language album, Gracias a la Vida. She made her New York concert debut on November 5, 1960, at the 92nd Street Y and on November 11, 1961, Baez played her first major New York concert at a sold-out performance at Town Hall. Robert Shelton, folk critic of the New York Times, praised the concert, saying, \\"That superb soprano voice, as lustrous and rich as old gold, flowed purely all evening with a wondrous ease. Her singing (unwound) like a spool of satin.\\"Stu Steadman (2017). \\"This Day in Rock\\". www.thisdayinrock.com Years later when Baez thought back to that concert, she laughed, saying: \\"I remember in 1961 my manager sending me this newspaper (clipping) in the mail (which) read, 'Joan Baez Town Hall Concert, SRO.' I thought SRO meant 'sold right out.' I was so innocent of it all.\\"David A. Maurer (March 10, 2016). \\"Joan Baez: Folk Singer, Hereditary Activist\\". The Daily Progress. Her second release, Joan Baez, Vol. 2 (1961), went \\"gold\\", as did Joan Baez in Concert, Part 1 (1962) and Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2 (1963). Like its immediate predecessor, Joan Baez, Vol. 2 contained strictly traditional material. Her two albums of live material, Joan Baez in Concert, Part 1 and its second counterpart, were unique in that unlike most live albums they contained only new songs rather than established favorites. It was Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2 that featured Baez's first-ever Dylan cover. From the early-to-mid-1960s, Baez emerged at the forefront of the American roots revival, where she introduced her audiences to the then-unknown Bob Dylan, and was emulated by artists such as Judy Collins, Emmylou Harris, Joni Mitchell, and Bonnie Raitt. On November 23, 1962, Baez appeared on the cover of Time Magazine‚Äîa rare honor then for a musician. Though primarily an album artist, several of Baez' singles have charted, the first being her 1965 cover of Phil Ochs' \\"There but for Fortune\\", which became a mid-level chart hit in the U.S. and a top-ten single in the United Kingdom. Baez added other instruments to her recordings on Farewell, Angelina (1965), which features several Dylan songs interspersed with more traditional fare. Joan Baez April 1966 Deciding to experiment with different styles, Baez turned to Peter Schickele, a classical music composer, who provided classical orchestration for her next three albums: No√´l (1966), Joan (1967), and Baptism: A Journey Through Our Time (1968). No√´l was a Christmas album of traditional material, while Baptism was akin to a concept album, featuring Baez reading and singing poems written by celebrated poets such as James Joyce, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, and Walt Whitman. Joan featured interpretations of work by then-contemporary composers, including John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Tim Hardin, Paul Simon, and Donovan. In 1968, Baez traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, where a marathon recording session resulted in two albums. The first, Any Day Now (1968), consists exclusively of Dylan covers. The other, the country-music-infused David's Album (1969), was recorded for then-husband David Harris, a prominent anti- Vietnam War protester eventually imprisoned for draft resistance. Harris, a country-music fan, turned Baez toward more complex country-rock influences beginning with David's Album. Later in 1968, Baez published her first memoir, Daybreak (by Dial Press). In August 1969, her appearance at Woodstock in upstate New York raised her international musical and political profile, particularly after the successful release of the documentary film Woodstock (1970). Beginning in the late 1960s, Baez began writing many of her own songs, beginning with \\"Sweet Sir Galahad\\" and \\"A Song For David\\", both songs appearing on her 1970 (I Live) One Day at a Time album; \\"Sweet Sir Galahad\\" was written about her sister Mimi's second marriage, while \\"A Song For David\\" was a tribute to Harris. One Day at a Time, like David's Album, featured a decidedly country sound. Baez's distinctive vocal style and political activism had a significant impact on American popular music. She was one of the first musicians to use her popularity as a vehicle for social protest, singing and marching for human rights and peace. Pete Seeger, Odetta, and decades-long friend Harry Belafonte were her early social justice advocate influences. Baez came to be considered the \\"most accomplished interpretive folksinger/songwriter of the 1960s\\".Joan Baez. United States History. History.com. Her appeal extended far beyond the folk-music audience. Of her fourteen Vanguard albums, thirteen made the top 100 of Billboard's mainstream pop chart, eleven made the top forty, eight made the top twenty, and four made the top ten. =1970s and the end of Vanguard years= alt=Joan Baez playing on stage in a Hamburg TV studio, 1973 After eleven years with Vanguard, Baez decided in 1971 to cut ties with the label that had released her albums since 1960. She delivered Vanguard one last success with the gold-selling album Blessed Are... (1971), which included a top-ten hit in \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\", her cover of The Band's signature song. With Come from the Shadows (1972), Baez switched to A&M; Records, where she remained for four years and six albums. Joan Baez wrote \\"The Story of Bangladesh\\" in 1971. This song was based on the Pakistani army crackdown on unarmed sleeping Bengali students at Dhaka University on March 25, 1971, which ignited the prolonged nine-month Bangladesh Liberation War. The song was later entitled \\"The Song of Bangladesh\\" and released in a 1972 album from Chandos Music.Words and Music by Joan Baez, Song of Bangladesh , lyrics joanbaez.com. During this period in late 1971, she reunited with composer Peter Schickele to record two tracks, \\"Rejoice in the Sun\\" and \\"Silent Running\\" for the science-fiction film Silent Running. The two songs were issued as a single on Decca (32890). In addition to this, another LP was released on Decca (DL 7-9188) and was later reissued by Var√®se Sarabande on black (STV-81072) and green (VC-81072) vinyl. In 1998, a limited release on CD by the \\"Valley Forge Record Groupe\\" was released. Baez's first album for A&M;, Come from the Shadows, was recorded in Nashville, and included a number of more personal compositions, including \\"Love Song to a Stranger\\" and \\"Myths\\", as well as work by Mimi Farina, John Lennon, and Anna Marly. Where Are You Now, My Son? (1973) featured a 23-minute title song which took up all of the B-side of the album. Half spoken word poem and half tape- recorded sounds, the song documented Baez's visit to Hanoi, North Vietnam, in December 1972 during which she and her traveling companions survived the 11-day-long Christmas Bombings campaign over Hanoi and Haiphong.Democracy Now, December 26, 2002 (audio). Interview with Joan Baez by Amy Goodman. Democracy Now. Retrieved June 17, 2010. (See Vietnam War in Civil rights section below.) Gracias a la Vida (1974) (the title song written and first performed by Chilean folk singer Violeta Parra) followed and was a success in both the U.S. and Latin America. It included the song \\"Cucurrucuc√∫ paloma\\". Flirting with mainstream pop music as well as writing her own songs for Diamonds & Rust (1975), the album became the highest selling of Baez's career and included a second top-ten single in the form of the title track. After Gulf Winds (1976), an album of entirely self-composed songs and From Every Stage (1976), a live album that had Baez performing songs \\"from every stage\\" of her career, Baez again parted ways with a record label when she moved to CBS Records for Blowin' Away (1977) and Honest Lullaby (1979). =1980s and 1990s= In 1980, Baez was given honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degrees by Antioch University and Rutgers University for her political activism and the \\"universality of her music\\". In 1983, she appeared on the Grammy Awards, performing Dylan's anthemic \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\", a song she first performed twenty years earlier. Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Carlos Santana, performing in May 1984, Hamburg Baez also played a significant role in the 1985 Live Aid concert for African famine relief, opening the U.S. segment of the show in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She has toured on behalf of many other causes, including Amnesty International's 1986 A Conspiracy of Hope tour and a guest spot on their subsequent Human Rights Now! tour. Baez found herself without an American label for the release of Live Europe 83 (1984), which was released in Europe and Canada but not released commercially in the U.S. She did not have an American release until the album Recently (1987) on Gold Castle Records. In 1987, Baez's second autobiography called And a Voice to Sing With was published and became a New York Times bestseller. That same year, she traveled to the Middle East to visit with and sing songs of peace for Israel and the Palestinians. In May 1989, Baez performed at a music festival in communist Czechoslovakia called Bratislavsk√° l√Ωra. While there, she met future Czechoslovak president V√°clav Havel, whom she let carry her guitar so as to prevent his arrest by government agents. During her performance, she greeted members of Charter 77, a dissident human-rights group, which resulted in her microphone being shut off abruptly. Baez then proceeded to sing a cappella for the nearly four thousand gathered. Havel cited her as a great inspiration and influence in that country's Velvet Revolution, the revolution in which the Soviet-dominated communist government there was overthrown. Baez recorded two more albums with Gold Castle: Speaking of Dreams, (1989) and Brothers in Arms (1991). She then landed a contract with a major label, Virgin Records, recording Play Me Backwards (1992) for Virgin shortly before the company was purchased by EMI. She then switched to Guardian, with whom she produced a live album, Ring Them Bells (1995), and a studio album, Gone from Danger (1997). In 1993, at the invitation of Refugees International and sponsored by the Soros Foundation, she traveled to the war-torn Bosnia and Herzegovina region of former-Yugoslavia in an effort to help bring more attention to the suffering there. She was the first major artist to perform in Sarajevo since the outbreak of the Yugoslav civil war. In October of that year, Baez became the first major artist to perform in a professional concert presentation on Alcatraz Island (a former U.S. federal prison) in San Francisco, California, in a benefit for her sister Mimi's Bread and Roses organization. She later returned for another concert in 1996. =2000s= Beginning in 2001, Baez has had several successful long-term engagements as a lead character at San Francisco's Teatro ZinZanni. In August 2001, Vanguard began re-releasing Baez's first 13 albums, which she recorded for the label between 1960 and 1971. The reissues, being released through Vanguard's Original Master Series, feature digitally restored sound, unreleased bonus songs, new and original artwork, and new liner-note essays written by Arthur Levy. Likewise, her six A&M; albums were reissued in 2003. Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival 2005 at Golden Gate Park In 2003, Baez was also a judge for the third annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.3rd Annual Independent Music Awards ‚Äì Judges Independent Music Awards; Music Resource Group, LLC, 2004. Retrieved June 17, 2010. Her album, Dark Chords on a Big Guitar (2003), features songs by composers half her age, while a November 2004 performance at New York City's Bowery Ballroom was recorded for a live release, Bowery Songs (2005). On October 1, 2005, she performed at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival, at San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Then, on January 13, 2006, Baez performed at the funeral of Lou Rawls, where she led Jesse Jackson, Sr., Wonder, and others in the singing of \\"Amazing Grace\\". On June 6, 2006, Baez joined Bruce Springsteen on stage at his San Francisco concert, where the two performed the rolling anthem \\"Pay Me My Money Down\\". In September 2006, Baez contributed a live, retooled version of her classic song \\"Sweet Sir Galahad\\" to a Starbucks's exclusive XM Artist Confidential album. In the new version, she changed the lyric \\"here's to the dawn of their days\\" to \\"here's to the dawn of her days\\", as a tribute to her late sister Mimi, about whom Baez wrote the song in 1969. Later on, October 8, 2006, she appeared as a special surprise guest at the opening ceremony of the Forum 2000 international conference in Prague, Czech Republic. Her performance was kept secret from former Czech Republic President Havel until the moment she appeared on stage. Havel was a great admirer of both Baez and her work. During Baez's next visit to Prague, in April 2007, the two met again when she performed in front of a sold-out house at Prague's Lucerna Hall, a building erected by Havel's grandfather. On December 2, 2006, she made a guest appearance at the Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir's Christmas Concert at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California. Her participation included versions of \\"Let Us Break Bread Together\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\". She also joined the choir in the finale of \\"O Holy Night\\". Joan Baez concert in Dresden, Germany, July 2008 In February 2007, Proper Records reissued her live album Ring Them Bells (1995), which featured duets with artists ranging from Dar Williams and Mimi Fari√±a to the Indigo Girls and Mary Chapin Carpenter. The reissue features a 16-page booklet and six unreleased live tracks from the original recording sessions, including \\"Love Song To A Stranger\\", \\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\", \\"Geordie\\", \\"Gracias a la Vida\\", \\"The Water Is Wide\\" and \\"Stones in the Road\\", bringing the total track listing to 21 songs (on two discs). In addition, Baez recorded a duet of \\"Jim Crow\\" with John Mellencamp which appears on his album Freedom's Road (2007). He has called the album a \\"Woody Guthrie rock album\\". The recording was heavily influenced by albums from the 1960s, which is why he invited an icon from that era to appear with him. Also in February 2007, she received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. The day after receiving the honor, she appeared at the Grammy Awards ceremony and introduced a performance by the Dixie Chicks. August 13, 2009, Seattle September 9, 2008, saw the release of the studio album Day After Tomorrow, produced by Steve Earle and featuring three of his songs.

On October 14, 2009, PBS aired an episode of its documentary series American Masters, entitled Joan Baez: How Sweet the Sound. It was produced and directed by Mary Wharton. A DVD and CD of the soundtrack were released at the same time. =2010s= On April 4, 2017, Baez released on her Facebook page her first song in twenty-seven years, \\"Nasty Man\\", a protest song against US President Donald Trump which became a viral hit. On April 7, 2017, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On March 2, 2018, she released a new studio album entitled Whistle Down the Wind, and has been undertaking her \\"Fare Thee Well Tour\\" to support the album. On April 30, 2019, Baez told Rolling Stone that she had been approached to perform at the Woodstock 50 festival, but had turned the offer down for \\"it was too complicated to even get involved in\\" and her \\"instincts\\" were telling her \\"no\\". On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Joan Baez among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Social and political involvement To reward her decades of dedicated activism, Baez was honoured with the Spirit of Americana/Free Speech award at the 2008 Americana Music Honors & Awards. =1950s= In 1956, Baez first heard Martin Luther King, Jr., speak about nonviolence, civil rights and social change which brought tears to her eyes. Several years later, the two became friends, with Baez participating in many of the Civil Rights Movement demonstrations that Dr. King helped organize. In 1958, at age 17, Baez committed her first act of civil disobedience by refusing to leave her Palo Alto High School classroom in Palo Alto, California, for an air raid drill. =Civil rights= The early years of Baez's career saw the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S. become a prominent issue. Her performance of \\"We Shall Overcome\\", the civil rights anthem written by Pete Seeger and Guy Carawan, at the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom permanently linked her to the song. Baez again sang \\"We Shall Overcome\\" in Sproul Plaza during the mid-1960s Free Speech Movement demonstrations at the University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California, and at many other rallies and protests. Her recording of the song \\"Birmingham Sunday\\" (1964), written by her brother-in- law, Richard Fari√±a, was used in the opening of 4 Little Girls (1997), Spike Lee's documentary film about the four young victims killed in the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. In 1965, Baez announced that she would be opening a school to teach nonviolent protest. She also participated in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches for voting rights. In November 2017 as part of a release of documents from the National Archives that were supposed to relate to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, a 1968 FBI report alleged that Baez was involved in the 1960s in an intimate affair with Dr. Martin Luther King, an accusation described by history professor Clayborne Carson, the director of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute and a Stanford University, as \\"part of a smear campaign\\" against King. =Vietnam War= Highly visible in civil-rights marches, Baez became more vocal about her disagreement with the Vietnam War. In 1964, she publicly endorsed resisting taxes by withholding sixty percent of her 1963 income taxes. In 1964, she founded the Institute for the Study of Nonviolence (along with her mentor Sandperl) and encouraged draft resistance at her concerts. The Institute for the Study of Nonviolence would later branch into the Resource Center for Nonviolence. In 1966, Baez's autobiography, Daybreak, was released. It is the most detailed report of her life through 1966 and outlined her anti- war position, dedicating the book to men facing imprisonment for resisting the draft. Baez was arrested twice in 1967 for blocking the entrance of the Armed Forces Induction Center in Oakland, California, and spent over a month in jail. (See also David Harris section below.) She was a frequent participant in anti-war marches and rallies, including: * numerous protests in New York City organized by the Fifth Avenue Vietnam Peace Parade Committee, starting with the March 1966 Fifth Avenue Peace Parade; * a conversation with then husband David Harris at UCLA in 1968 discussing the resistance to the draft during the Vietnam war. *a free 1967 concert at the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., that had been opposed by the Daughters of the American Revolution which attracted a crowd of 30,000 to hear her anti-war message; * the 1969 Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam protests. There were many others, culminating in Phil Ochs's The War Is Over celebration in New York City in May 1975. During the Christmas season 1972, Baez joined a peace delegation traveling to North Vietnam, both to address human rights in the region, and to deliver Christmas mail to American prisoners of war. During her time there, she was caught in the U.S. military's \\"Christmas bombing\\" of Hanoi, North Vietnam, during which the city was bombed for eleven straight days. Her disquiet at the human-rights violations of communist Vietnam made her increasingly critical of its government and she organized the May 30, 1979, publication of a full-page advertisement (published in four major U.S. newspapers) in which the communists were described as having created a nightmare. Her one-time anti-war ally, Jane Fonda, refused to join in Baez's criticism of Hanoi, leading to what was publicly described as a feud between the two. =Human rights= Baez was instrumental in founding the USA section of Amnesty International in the 1970s, and has remained an active supporter of the organization. Baez's experiences regarding Vietnam's human-rights violations ultimately led her to found her own human-rights group in the late 1970s, Humanitas International, whose focus was to target oppression wherever it occurred, criticizing right and left-wing r√©gimes equally. In 1976, she was awarded the Thomas Merton Award for her ongoing activism. She toured Chile, Brazil and Argentina in 1981, but was prevented from performing in any of the three countries, for fear her criticism of their human-rights practices would reach mass audiences if she were given a podium. While there, she was kept under surveillance and subjected to death threats. A film of the ill-fated tour, There but for Fortune: Joan Baez in Latin America, was shown on PBS in 1982. In 1989, after the Tiananmen Massacre in Beijing, Baez wrote and released the song \\"China\\" to condemn the Chinese government for its violent and bloody crackdown on thousands of student protesters who called for establishment of democratic republicanism. In a second trip to Southeast Asia, Baez assisted in an effort to take food and medicine into the western regions of Cambodia, and participated in a United Nations Humanitarian Conference on Kampuchea. On July 17, 2006, Baez received the Distinguished Leadership Award from the Legal Community Against Violence. At the annual dinner event, they honored her for her lifetime of work against violence of all kinds. In 2015, Baez received the Ambassador of Conscience Award. In 2016, Baez advocated for the Innocence Project and Innocence Network. At each concert, Baez informs the audience about the organizations' efforts to exhonerate the wrongfully convicted and reform the system to prevent such incidents. Opposing the death penalty In December 2005, Baez appeared and sang \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\\" at the California protest at the San Quentin State Prison against the execution of Tookie Williams.Jenifer Warren, Jenifer and Dolan, Maura (December 13, 2005).

She had previously performed the same song at San Quentin at the 1992 vigil protesting the execution of Robert Alton Harris, the first man to be executed in California after the death penalty was reinstated. She subsequently lent her prestige to the campaign opposing the execution of Troy Davis by the State of Georgia. LGBT rights Baez has also been prominent in the struggle for gay and lesbian rights. In 1978, she performed at several benefit concerts to defeat the Briggs Initiative, which proposed banning all gay people from teaching in the public schools of California. Later that same year, she participated in memorial marches for the assassinated San Francisco city supervisor, Harvey Milk, who was openly gay. In the 1990s, she appeared with her friend Janis Ian at a benefit for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a gay lobbying organization, and performed at the San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride March. Her song \\"Altar Boy and the Thief\\" from Blowin' Away (1977) was written as a dedication to her gay fanbase. Iran On June 25, 2009, Baez created a special version of \\"We Shall Overcome\\" with a few lines of Persian lyrics in support of peaceful protests by Iranian people. She recorded it in her home and posted the video on YouTubeBaez, Joan (June 25, 2009). ; Google Inc. Retrieved June 17, 2010. and on her personal website.

Retrieved June 18, 2010. =War in Iraq= In early 2003, Baez performed at two rallies of hundreds of thousands of people in San Francisco protesting the U.S. invasion of Iraq (as she had earlier done before smaller crowds in 1991 to protest the Gulf War). In August 2003, she was invited by Emmylou Harris and Steve Earle to join them in London, UK, at the Concert For a Landmine-Free World. In the summer of 2004, Baez joined Michael Moore's \\"Slacker uprising Tour\\" on American college campuses, encouraging young people to get out and vote for peace candidates in the upcoming national election. In August 2005, Baez appeared at the Texas anti-war protest that had been started by Cindy Sheehan. = Tree sit-in = On May 23, 2006, Baez once again joined Julia \\"Butterfly\\" Hill, this time in a \\"tree sit\\" in a giant tree on the site of the South Central Farm in a poor neighborhood of downtown Los Angeles, California. Baez and Hill were hoisted into the tree, where they remained overnight. The women, in addition to many other activists and celebrities, were protesting the imminent eviction of the community farmers and demolition of the site, which is the largest urban farm in the state. Because many of the South Central Farmers are immigrants from Central America, Baez sang several songs from her 1974 Spanish-language album, Gracias a la Vida, including the title track and \\"No Nos Mover√°n\\" (\\"We Shall Not Be Moved\\"). =2008 presidential election= Throughout most of her career, Baez remained apprehensive about involving herself in party politics. However, on February 3, 2008, Baez wrote a letter to the editor at the San Francisco Chronicle endorsing Barack Obama in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. She noted: \\"Through all those years, I chose not to engage in party politics. ... At this time, however, changing that posture feels like the responsible thing to do. If anyone can navigate the contaminated waters of Washington, lift up the poor, and appeal to the rich to share their wealth, it is Sen. Barack Obama.\\" Playing at the Glastonbury Festival in June, Baez said during the introduction of a song that one reason she likes Obama is because he reminds her of another old friend of hers: Martin Luther King, Jr. Although a highly political figure throughout most of her career, Baez had never publicly endorsed a major political party candidate prior to Obama. However, after Obama was elected, she expressed that she would likely never do so again, saying in a 2013 interview in The Huffington Post that \\"In some ways I'm disappointed, but in some ways it was silly to expect more. If he had taken his brilliance, his eloquence, his toughness and not run for office he could have led a movement. Once he got in the Oval Office he couldn't do anything.\\". She performed at the White House on February 10, 2010, as part of an evening celebrating the music associated with the civil rights movement, performing \\"We Shall Overcome\\". =Joan Baez Award= On March 18, 2011, Baez was honored by Amnesty International at its 50th Anniversary Annual General Meeting in San Francisco. The tribute to Baez was the inaugural event for the Amnesty International Joan Baez Award for Outstanding Inspirational Service in the Global Fight for Human Rights. Baez was presented with the first award in recognition of her human rights work with Amnesty International and beyond, and the inspiration she has given activists around the world. In future years, the award is to be presented to an artist ‚Äì music, film, sculpture, paint or other medium ‚Äì who has similarly helped advance human rights. =Occupy Wall Street= On November 11, 2011, Baez played as part of a musical concert for the protestors at Occupy Wall Street. Her three-song set included \\"Joe Hill\\", a cover of the Rolling Stones' \\"Salt of the Earth\\" and her own composition \\"Where's My Apple Pie?\\" =Catalan independence movement= Baez has been a strong defender of the Catalan independence movement due to its non-violent nature. On July 21, 2019, she described jailed Catalan independence leaders as political prisoners. A few days later, on July 26, 2019, she visited former President of the Parliament of Catalonia Carme Forcadell in prison; she has been accused of rebellion during the 2017‚Äì18 Spanish constitutional crisis. Personal life =Early relationships= Baez's first real boyfriend was Michael New, a fellow student from Trinidad whom she met at her college in the late 1950s. Years later in 1979, he inspired her song \\"Michael\\". Like Baez, he attended classes only occasionally. The two spent a considerable amount of time together, but Baez was unable to balance her blossoming career and her relationship. The two bickered and made up repeatedly, but it was apparent to Baez that New was beginning to resent her success and new-found local celebrity. One night she saw him kissing another woman on a street corner. Despite this, the relationship remained intact for several years after the two moved to California together in 1960. =Bob Dylan= Baez with Bob Dylan at the civil rights March on Washington, August 28, 1963 Baez first met Dylan in April 1961 at Gerde's Folk City in New York City's Greenwich Village. At the time, Baez had already released her debut album and her popularity as the emerging \\"Queen of Folk\\" was on the rise. Baez was initially unimpressed with the \\"urban hillbilly\\", but was impressed with one of Dylan's first compositions, \\"Song to Woody\\" and remarked that she would like to record it. By 1963, Baez had already released three albums, two of which had been certified gold, and she invited Dylan on stage to perform alongside her at the Newport Folk Festival. The two performed the Dylan composition \\"With God on Our Side\\", a performance that set the stage for many more duets like it in the months and years to come. Typically while on tour, Baez would invite Dylan to sing on stage partly by himself and partly with her, much to the chagrin of her fans. Before meeting Dylan, Baez's topical songs were very few: \\"Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream\\", \\"We Shall Overcome\\", and an assortment of Negro spirituals. Baez would later say that Dylan's songs seemed to update the topics of protest and justice. By the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the UK, their relationship had slowly begun to fizzle out. The couple are captured in D. A. Pennebaker's documentary film Dont Look Back (1967). Baez toured with Dylan as a performer on his Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975‚Äì76. She sang four songs with Dylan on the live album of the tour, The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue, released in 2002. Baez appeared with Dylan in the one-hour TV special Hard Rain, filmed at Fort Collins, Colorado, in May 1976. Baez also starred as 'The Woman in White' in the film Renaldo and Clara (1978), directed by Bob Dylan and filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue. They performed together at the Peace Sunday anti-nuke concert in 1982. Dylan and Baez toured together again in 1984 along with Carlos Santana. Baez discussed her relationship with Dylan in Martin Scorsese's documentary film No Direction Home (2005), and in the PBS American Masters biography of Baez, How Sweet the Sound (2009). Baez wrote and composed at least three songs that were specifically about Dylan. In \\"To Bobby\\", written in 1972, she urged Dylan to return to political activism, while in \\"Diamonds & Rust\\", the title track from her 1975 album, she revisited her feelings for him in warm, yet direct terms. \\"Winds of the Old Days\\", also on the Diamonds & Rust album, is a bittersweet reminiscence about her time with \\"Bobby\\". The references to Baez in Dylan's songs are far less clear. Baez herself has suggested that she was the subject of both \\"Visions of Johanna\\" and \\"Mama, You Been on My Mind\\", although the latter was more likely about his relationship with Suze Rotolo.Gray p 30 Baez implied when speaking about the connection to \\"Diamonds and Rust\\" that \\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\" is, at least in part, a metaphor for Dylan's view of his relationship with her. As for \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", \\"Visions of Johanna\\", \\"She Belongs to Me\\", and other songs alleged to have been written about Baez, neither Dylan nor biographers such as Clinton Heylin and Michael Gray have had anything definitive to say, either way, regarding the subject of these songs. =David Harris= In October 1967, Baez, her mother and nearly 70 other women were arrested at the Oakland, California, Armed Forces Induction Center for blocking its doorways to prevent entrance by young inductees, and in support of young men who refused military induction. They were incarcerated in the Santa Rita Jail, and it was here that Baez met David Harris, who was kept on the men's side but who still managed to visit with Baez regularly. The two formed a close bond upon their release and Baez moved into his draft-resistance commune in the hills above Stanford, California. The pair had known each other for three months when they decided to wed. After confirming the news to Associated Press, media outlets began dedicating ample press to the impending nuptials (at one point, Time magazine referred to the event as the \\"Wedding of the Century\\"). After finding a pacifist preacher and a church outfitted with peace signs and writing a blend of Episcopalian and Quaker wedding vows, Baez and Harris married in New York City on March 26, 1968. Her friend Judy Collins sang at the ceremony. After the wedding, Baez and Harris moved into a home in the Los Altos Hills on of land called Struggle Mountain, part of a commune, where they tended gardens and were strict vegetarians. A short time later, Harris refused induction into the armed forces and was indicted. On July 16, 1969, Harris was taken by federal marshals to prison. Baez was visibly pregnant in public in the months that followed, most notably at the Woodstock Festival, where she performed a handful of songs in the early morning. The documentary film Carry It On was produced during this period, and was released in 1970.\\"Carry It On\\". Directed by Chris Knight. The New Film Co., 1970. Official website. The film's behind-the-scenes looks at Harris's views and arrest and Baez on her subsequent performance tour was positively reviewed in Time magazine and The New York Times.Wilson, John S.

Among the songs Baez wrote about this period of her life are \\"A Song for David\\", \\"Myths\\", \\"Prison Trilogy (Billy Rose)\\" and \\"Fifteen Months\\" (the amount of time Harris was imprisoned). Their son Gabriel was born on December 2, 1969. Harris was released from Texas prison after 15 months, but they separated three months after his release and the couple divorced amicably in 1973.How Sweet The Sound: Joan Baez They shared custody of Gabriel, who lived primarily with Baez. Explaining the split, Baez wrote in her autobiography: \\"I am made to live alone.\\" Baez and Harris remained on friendly terms throughout the years; they reunited on-camera for the 2009 American Masters documentary for the USA's PBS. Their son Gabriel is a drummer and occasionally tours with his mother. He has a daughter Jasmine who also sang with Joan Baez at Kidztock in 2010. =Steve Jobs= Joan Baez at The Egg (Albany, NY), March 2016 Baez dated Apple Computer cofounder Steve Jobs during the early 1980s.Manock, Jerry (June 1982). \\"Invasion of Texaco Towers\\" .

The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace. ( ‚Äì late 1314), known derisively as Toom Tabard (meaning \\"empty coat\\"), was King of Scots from 1292 to 1296. Little is known of his early life. After the death of Margaret, Maid of Norway, Scotland entered an interregnum during which several competitors for the Crown of Scotland put forward claims. Balliol was chosen from among them as the new King of Scotland by a group of selected noblemen headed by King Edward I of England. Edward used his influence over the process to subjugate Scotland and undermined Balliol's personal reign by treating Scotland as a vassal of England. Edward's influence in Scottish affairs tainted Balliol's reign and the Scottish nobility deposed him and appointed a Council of Twelve to rule instead. This council signed a treaty with France known as the Auld Alliance. In retaliation, Edward invaded Scotland, starting the Wars of Scottish Independence. After a Scottish defeat in 1296, Balliol abdicated and was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Eventually, Balliol was sent to his estates in France and retired into obscurity, taking no more part in politics. Scotland was then left without a monarch until the accession of Robert the Bruce in 1306. John Balliol's son Edward Balliol would later exert a claim to the Scottish throne against the Bruce claim during the minority of Robert's son David. Name Balliol arms: Or an inescutcheon gules voided (orle) In Norman French his name was ', in Middle Scots it was ', and in Scottish Gaelic, '. In Scots he was known by the nickname ', usually understood to mean \\"empty coat‚Äú in the sense that he was an ineffective king. Alternatively the word coat may refer to coat of arms; either to the Balliol arms which are a plain shield with an orle, also known as an inescutcheon voided or because his arms were stripped from his tabard in public. Early life Little of Balliol's early life is known. He was born between 1248 and 1250 at an unknown location; possibilities include Galloway, Picardy and Barnard Castle, County Durham.G. P. Stell, \\"John [John de Balliol] (c.1248x50‚Äì1314)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2005 , accessed 25 July 2007. He was the son of John, 5th Baron Balliol, Lord of Barnard Castle (and founder of Balliol College, Oxford), and his wife Dervorguilla of Galloway, daughter of Alan, Lord of Galloway and granddaughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon - the brother of William the Lion.Dunbar, Sir Archibald H.,Bt., Scottish Kings ‚Äì A Revised Chronology of Scottish History 1005‚Äì1625, Edinburgh, 1899: p. 115 From his mother he inherited significant lands in Galloway and claim to Lordship over the Gallovidians, as well as various English and Scottish estates of the Huntingdon inheritance; from his father he inherited large estates in England and France, such as Hitchin, in Hertfordshire. Accession as King of Scots The seal of John Balliol In 1284 Balliol had attended a parliament at Scone, which had recognised Margaret, Maid of Norway, as heir presumptive to her grandfather, King Alexander III.Foedera, p 228 Following the deaths of Alexander III in 1286 and Margaret in 1290, John Balliol was a competitor for the Scottish crown in the Great Cause, as he was a great-great-great-grandson of David I through his mother (and therefore one generation further than his main rival Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale, grandfather of Robert the Bruce, who later became king), being senior in genealogical primogeniture but not in proximity of blood. He submitted his claim to the Scottish auditors with King Edward I of England as the administrator of the court, at Berwick- upon-Tweed on 6 June 1291.Dunbar, Sir Archibald H.,Bt., Scottish Kings ‚Äì A Revised Chronology of Scottish History 1005‚Äì1625, Edinburgh, 1899: p. 116 The Scottish auditors' decision in favour of Balliol was pronounced in the Great Hall of Berwick Castle on 17 November 1292, and he was inaugurated accordingly King of Scotland at Scone, 30 November 1292, St. Andrew's Day. Edward I, who had coerced recognition as Lord Paramount of Scotland, the feudal superior of the realm, steadily undermined John's authority. He demanded homage to be paid towards himself, legal authority over the Scottish King in any disputes brought against him by his own subjects, contribution towards the costs for the defence of England, and military support was expected in his war against France. He treated Scotland as a feudal vassal state and repeatedly humiliated the new king. The Scots soon tired of their deeply compromised king; the direction of affairs was allegedly taken out of his hands by the leading men of the kingdom, who appointed a Council of Twelve‚Äîin practice, a new panel of Guardians‚Äîat Stirling in July 1295. They went on to conclude a treaty of mutual assistance with France‚Äîknown in later years as the Auld Alliance. Abdication In retaliation for Scotland's treaty with France, Edward I invaded, commencing the Wars of Scottish Independence. The Scots were defeated at Dunbar and the English took Dunbar Castle on 27 April 1296. John abdicated at Stracathro near Montrose on 10 July 1296. Here the arms of Scotland were formally torn from John's surcoat, giving him the abiding name of \\"Toom Tabard\\" (empty coat).This translation is disputed. John was imprisoned in the Tower of London until allowed to go to France in July 1299. When his baggage was examined at Dover, the Royal Golden Crown and Seal of the Kingdom of Scotland, with many vessels of gold and silver, and a considerable sum of money, were found in his chests. Edward I ordered that the Crown be offered to the shrine of St Thomas Becket at Canterbury, and that the money be returned to John for the expenses of his journey. But he kept the Seal himself.Foedera, vol.1, part 2, p.909 John was released into the custody of Pope Boniface VIII on condition that he remain at a papal residence. He was released around the summer of 1301 and lived the rest of his life on his family's ancestral estates at H√©licourt, Picardy. Over the next few years, there were several Scottish rebellions against Edward (for example, in 1297 under William Wallace and Andrew Moray). The rebels would invoke the name of \\"King John\\", on the grounds that his abdication had been under duress and therefore invalid. This claim came to look increasingly tenuous, as John's position under nominal house-arrest meant that he could not return to Scotland nor campaign for his release, despite the Scots' diplomatic attempts in Paris and Rome. After 1302, he made no further attempts to extend his personal support to the Scots. Effectively, Scotland was left without a monarch until the accession of Robert the Bruce in 1306. Death John died in late 1314 at his family's ch√¢teau at H√©licourt in France. On 4 January 1315, King Edward II of England, writing to King Louis X of France, said that he had heard of the death of 'Sir John de Balliol'Dunbar, Sir Archibald H.,Bt., Scottish Kings ‚Äì A Revised Chronology of Scottish History 1005‚Äì1625, Edinburgh, 1899: p. 117 and requested the fealty and homage of Edward Balliol to be given by proxy. A John de Bailleul is interred in the church of St Waast at Bailleul-sur-Eaune in Normandy. This may or may not be the Scottish king. John was survived by his son Edward Balliol, who later revived his family's claim to the Scottish throne, received support from the English, and had some temporary successes. Marriage and children John Balliol and his wife John married around 9 February 1281 to Isabella de Warenne, daughter of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey. Her mother, Alice de Lusignan, was niece of Henry III of England. John was also the brother-in-law to John Comyn, who was killed following a scuffle with Robert the Bruce in February 1306, in the chapel of the Greyfriars, Dumfries. Opinion remains divided on who started the fight and who exactly killed Comyn. It has been established that John and Isabella had at least one child: * Edward Balliol, Scottish pretender, (d.1367). Possibly married to Marguerite de Taranto, daughter of Philip I, Prince of Taranto (d. 1332) ‚Äì annulled or divorced with no children. However, other children have been linked to the couple as other possible issue: * Henry de Balliol. He was killed in the Battle of Annan on 16 December 1332, leaving no children.Dunbar, Sir Archibald H.,Bt., Scottish Kings ‚Äì A Revised Chronology of Scottish History 1005‚Äì1625, Edinburgh, 1899: p. 118 * Agnes (or Maud or Anne) Balliol was married to Bryan FitzAlan, Lord FitzAlan, and feudal Baron of Bedale. They were parents to Agnes FitzAlan (b. 1298), who married Sir Gilbert Stapleton, Knt., of Bedale (1291‚Äì1324). Gilbert is better known for his participation in the assassination of Piers Gaveston, Earl of Cornwall. * Margaret Balliol. Married Sir John St Clere, Knight, of East Grinsted, Sussex, and left children, a daughter, Margaret, who married Sir William Wallis (or Waleys) of Glynde Place, Sussex. Fictional portrayals John Balliol has been depicted in drama: *John Balliol, An Historical Drama. In Five Acts (1825), play based on his life by William Tennant. *A character named Balliol, portrayed by British actor Bernard Horsfall, appears in Mel Gibson's 1995 Oscar-winning epic Braveheart, an heroic tale of Scottish national hero William Wallace. The character is merely presented as a claimant to the Scottish crown, with no further delving into his significance. He is presumably loosely based on John Balliol, although in reality he was a prisoner in France at that time.

It was first outlined by Kenneth Waltz in his 1979 book Theory of International Politics.According to , Waltz's book remains \\"the seminal text of neorealism\\". Alongside neoliberalism, neorealism is one of the two most influential contemporary approaches to international relations; the two perspectives have dominated international relations theory for the last three decades.. Neorealism emerged from the North American discipline of political science, and reformulates the classical realist tradition of E. H. Carr, Hans Morgenthau, George Kennan and Reinhold Niebuhr. Neorealism is subdivided into defensive and offensive neorealism. Origins Neorealism is an ideological departure from Hans Morgenthau's writing on classical realism. Classical realism originally explained the machinations of international politics as being based on human nature, and therefore subject to the ego and emotion of world leaders.Morgenthau, Hans J. Politics Among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace, 5th Edition, Revised. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1978, pp. 4‚Äì15) Neorealist thinkers instead propose that structural constraints‚Äînot strategy, egoism, or motivation‚Äîwill determine behavior in international relations. John Mearsheimer made significant distinctions between his version of offensive neorealism and Morgenthau in his book titled The Tragedy of Great Power Politics.The Tragedy of Great Power Politics Theory Structural realism holds that the nature of the international structure is defined by its ordering principle (anarchy), units of the system (states), and by the distribution of capabilities (measured by the number of great powers within the international system), with only the last being considered an independent variable with any meaningful change over time. The anarchic ordering principle of the international structure is decentralized, meaning there is no formal central authority; every sovereign state is formally equal in this system. These states act according to the logic of egoism, meaning states seek their own interest and will not subordinate their interest to the interests of other states. States are assumed at a minimum to want to ensure their own survival as this is a prerequisite to pursue other goals. This driving force of survival is the primary factor influencing their behavior and in turn ensures states develop offensive military capabilities for foreign interventionism and as a means to increase their relative power. Because states can never be certain of other states' future intentions, there is a lack of trust between states which requires them to be on guard against relative losses of power which could enable other states to threaten their survival. This lack of trust, based on uncertainty, is called the security dilemma. States are deemed similar in terms of needs but not in capabilities for achieving them. The positional placement of states in terms of abilities determines the distribution of capabilities. The structural distribution of capabilities then limits cooperation among states through fears of relative gains made by other states, and the possibility of dependence on other states. The desire and relative abilities of each state to maximize relative power constrain each other, resulting in a 'balance of power', which shapes international relations. It also gives rise to the 'security dilemma' that all nations face. There are two ways in which states balance power: internal balancing and external balancing. Internal balancing occurs as states grow their own capabilities by increasing economic growth and/or increasing military spending. External balancing occurs as states enter into alliances to check the power of more powerful states or alliances. Neorealists contend that there are essentially three possible systems according to changes in the distribution of capabilities, defined by the number of great powers within the international system. A unipolar system contains only one great power, a bipolar system contains two great powers, and a multipolar system contains more than two great powers. Neorealists conclude that a bipolar system is more stable (less prone to great power war and systemic change) than a multipolar system because balancing can only occur through internal balancing as there are no extra great powers with which to form alliances.. Because there is only internal balancing in a bipolar system, rather than external balancing, there is less opportunity for miscalculations and therefore less chance of great power war.. That is a simplification and a theoretical ideal.. =Defensive realism= Structural realism has become divided into two branches, defensive and offensive realism, following the publication of Mearsheimer's 'The Tragedy of Great Power Politics' in 2001. Waltz's original formulation of neorealism is now sometimes called Defensive Realism, while Mearsheimer's modification of the theory is referred to as Offensive Realism. Both branches agree that the structure of the system is what causes states to compete, but Defensive Realism posits that most states concentrate on maintaining their security (i.e. states are security maximizers), while Offensive Realism claims that all states seek to gain as much power as possible (i.e. states are power maximizers).. =Offensive realism= Offensive realism, developed by Mearsheimer differs in the amount of power that states desire. Mearsheimer proposes that states maximize relative power ultimately aiming for regional hegemony. Scholarly debate =Within realist thought= While neorealists agree that the structure of the international relations is the primary impetus in seeking security, there is disagreement among neorealist scholars as to whether states merely aim to survive or whether states want to maximize their relative power.. The former represents the ideas of Kenneth Waltz, while the latter represents the ideas of John Mearsheimer and offensive realism. Other debates include the extent to which states balance against power (in Waltz's original neorealism and classic realism), versus the extent to which states balance against threats (as introduced in Stephen Walt's 'The Origins of Alliances' (1987)), or balance against competing interests (as introduced in Randall Schweller's 'Deadly Imbalances' (1998)). =With other schools of thought= Neorealists conclude that because war is an effect of the anarchic structure of the international system, it is likely to continue in the future. Indeed, neorealists often argue that the ordering principle of the international system has not fundamentally changed from the time of Thucydides to the advent of nuclear warfare. The view that long-lasting peace is not likely to be achieved is described by other theorists as a largely pessimistic view of international relations. One of the main challenges to neorealist theory is the democratic peace theory and supporting research, such as the book Never at War. Neorealists answer this challenge by arguing that democratic peace theorists tend to pick and choose the definition of democracy to achieve the desired empirical result. For example, the Germany of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Dominican Republic of Juan Bosch, and the Chile of Salvador Allende are not considered to be \\"democracies of the right kind\\" or the conflicts do not qualify as wars according to these theorists. Furthermore, they claim several wars between democratic states have been averted only by causes other than ones covered by democratic peace theory.. Advocates of democratic peace theory see the spreading of democracy as helping to mitigate the effects of anarchy.. With enough democracies in the world, Bruce Russett thinks that it \\"may be possible in part to supersede the 'realist' principles (anarchy, the security dilemma of states) that have dominated practice since at least the seventeenth century.\\". John Mueller believes that it is not the spreading of democracy but rather other conditions (e.g., power) that bring about democracy and peace.. In consenting with Mueller's argument, Kenneth Waltz notes that \\"some of the major democracies‚ÄîBritain in the nineteenth century and the United States in the twentieth century‚Äîhave been among the most powerful states of their eras.\\" One of the most notable schools contending with neorealist thought, aside from neoliberalism, is the constructivist school, which is often seen to disagree with the neorealist focus on power and instead emphasises a focus on ideas and identity as an explanatory point for international relations trends. Recently, however, a school of thought called the English School merges neo-realist tradition with the constructivist technique of analyzing social norms to provide an increasing scope of analysis for International Relations.
