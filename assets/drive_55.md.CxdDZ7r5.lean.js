The GTD method rests on the idea of moving planned tasks and projects out of the mind by recording them externally and then breaking them into actionable work items. This allows attention to be focused on taking action on tasks, instead of recalling them. First published in 2001, a revised edition of the book was released in 2015 to reflect the changes in information technology during the preceding decade.  Themes  Allen first demonstrates stress reduction from the method with the following exercise, centered on a task that has an unclear outcome or whose next action is not defined. Allen calls these sources of stress \\"open loops\\", \\"incompletes\\", or \\"stuff\\". # The most annoying, distracting, or interesting task is chosen, and defined as an \\"incomplete\\". # A description of the successful outcome of the \\"incomplete\\" is written down in one sentence, along with the criteria by which the task will be considered completed. # The next step required to approach completion of the task is written down. # A self- assessment is made of the emotions experienced after completing the steps of this process. He claims stress can be reduced and productivity increased by putting reminders about everything you are not working on into a trusted system external to your mind. In this way, you can work on the task at hand without distraction from the \\"incompletes\\". The system in GTD requires you to have the following tools within easy reach: * An inbox * A trash can * A filing system for reference material * Several lists (detailed below) * A calendar. These tools can be physical or electronic as appropriate (e.g., a physical \\"in\\" tray or an email inbox). Then, as \\"stuff\\" enters your life, it is captured in these tools and processed with the following workflow. = Workflow = Logic tree diagram illustrating the second and third steps (process/clarify and organize) of the five-step Getting Things Done workflow. The GTD workflow consists of five stages: capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage. (The first edition used the names collect, process, organize, plan, and do; the descriptions of the stages are similar in both editions). Once all the material (\\"stuff\\") is captured (or collected) in the inbox, each item is clarified and organized by asking and answering questions about each item in turn as shown in the black boxes in the logic tree diagram. As a result, items end up in one of the eight oval end points in the diagram: * in the trash * on the someday/maybe list * in a neat reference filing system * on a list of tasks, with the outcome and next action defined if the \\"incomplete\\" is a \\"project\\" (i.e., if it will require two or more steps to complete it) * immediately completed and checked off if it can be completed in under two minutes * delegated to someone else and, if you want a reminder to follow up, added to a \\"waiting for\\" list * on a context-based \\"next action\\" list if there is only one step to complete it * on your calendar Empty your inbox or inboxes daily or at least weekly (\\"in\\" to empty). Don't use your inbox as a \\"to do\\" list. Don't put clarified items back into the inbox. Emptying your inbox doesn't mean finishing everything. It just means applying the \\"capture, clarify, organize\\" steps to all your \\"stuff\\". Next, reflection (termed planning in the first edition) occurs. Multi-step projects identified above are assigned a desired outcome and a single \\"next action\\". Finally, a task from your task list is worked on (\\"engage\\" in the 2nd edition, \\"do\\" in the 1st edition) unless the calendar dictates otherwise. You select which task to work on next by considering where you are (i.e., the \\"context\\", such as at home, at work, out shopping, by the phone, at your computer, with a particular person), time available, energy available, and priority. = Implementation = Because hardware and software is changing so rapidly, GTD is deliberately technologically-neutral. (In fact, Allen advises people to start with a paper- based system.) Many task management tools claim to implement GTD methodology and Allen maintains a list of some technology that has been adopted in or designed for GTD. Some are designated \\"GTD Enabled\\", meaning Allen was involved in the design. = Perspective = Allen emphasizes two key elements of GTD ‚Äî control and perspective. The workflow is the center of the control aspect. The goal of the control processes in GTD is to get everything except the current task out of your head and into this trusted system external to your mind. He borrows a simile used in martial arts termed \\"mind like water\\". When a small object is thrown into a pool of water, the water responds appropriately with a small splash followed by quiescence. When a large object is thrown in the water again responds appropriately with a large splash followed by quiescence. The opposite of \\"mind like water\\" is a mind that never returns to quiescence but remains continually stressed by every input. With a trusted system and \\"mind like water\\" you can have a better perspective on your life. Allen recommends reflection from six levels, called \\"Horizons of Focus\\": * Horizon 5: Life * Horizon 4: Long-term visions * Horizon 3: 1-2 year goals * Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountability * Horizon 1: Current projects * Ground: Current actions Unlike some theories, which focus on top-down goal- setting, GTD works in the opposite direction. Allen argues that it is often difficult for individuals to focus on big picture goals if they cannot sufficiently control the day-to-day tasks that they frequently must face. By developing and using the trusted system that deals with day-to-day inputs, an individual can free up mental space to begin moving up to the next level. Allen recommends scheduling a weekly review, reflecting on the different levels. The perspective gained from these reviews should drive one's priorities at the project level. Priorities at the project level in turn determine the priority of the individual tasks and commitments gathered during the workflow process. During a weekly review, determine the context for the tasks and put each task on its appropriate list. An example of grouping together similar tasks would be making a list of outstanding telephone calls, or the tasks/errands to perform while out shopping. Context lists can be defined by the set of tools available or by the presence of individuals or groups for whom one has items to discuss or present. = Summary = GTD is based on storing, tracking, and retrieving the information related to the things that need to get done. Mental blocks we encounter are caused by insufficient 'front-end' planning. This means thinking in advance, generating a series of actions which can later be undertaken without further planning. The mind's \\"reminder system\\" is inefficient and seldom reminds us of what we need to do at the time and place when we can do it. Consequently, the \\"next actions\\" stored by context in the \\"trusted system\\" act as an external support which ensures that we are presented with the right reminders at the right time. As GTD relies on external reminders, it can be seen as an application of the theories of distributed cognition or the extended mind.  Reception  In 2005, Wired called GTD a \\"new cult for the info age\\", describing the enthusiasm for this method among information technology and knowledge workers as a kind of cult following. Allen's ideas have also been popularized through the Howard Stern Show (Stern referenced it daily throughout 2012's summer) and the Internet, especially via blogs such as 43 Folders, Lifehacker, and The Simple Dollar. In 2005, Ben Hammersley interviewed David Allen for The Guardian article titled \\"Meet the man who can bring order to your universe\\", saying: \\"For me, as with the hundreds of thousands around the world who press the book into their friends' hands with fire in their eyes, Allen's ideas are nothing short of life-changing\\". In 2007, Time Magazine called Getting Things Done the self-help business book of its time. In 2007, Wired ran another article about GTD and Allen, quoting him as saying \\"the workings of an automatic transmission are more complicated than a manual transmission... to simplify a complex event, you need a complex system\\". A paper in the journal Long Range Planning by Francis Heylighen and Cl√©ment Vidal of the Free University of Brussels showed \\"recent insights in psychology and cognitive science support and extend GTD's recommendations\\".

The serial is set on the superstitious and mineral-rich planet Peladon. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) and his travelling companion Jo Grant (Katy Manning) discover the High Priest Hepesh (Geoffrey Toone) conspiring to stop Peladon from joining the Galactic Federation so that the old ways on the planet are preserved. Plot The planet Peladon, led by its young king Peladon, is on the verge of joining the Galactic Federation, their delegates ready to deliberate and take a final vote. High Priest Hepesh is opposed, warning that the curse of Aggedor the Royal Beast of Peladon will visit doom upon them. The TARDIS materialises on the edge of a cliff below the castle. The Third Doctor and Jo barely leave the ship before it tumbles over the edge of the cliff; they climb to the castle to get help. Peladon asks for Hepesh's support to join the Federation, but Hepesh does not trust the aliens. The Doctor and Jo are discovered by palace guards, who take them to the throne room where the delegates are gathered: Alpha Centauri, Arcturus, and Lord Izlyr and Ssorg of the Ice Warriors. The Doctor is mistaken for the delegate from Earth. He introduces Jo as \\"Princess Josephine of TARDIS\\", a neutral royal observer from Earth. Several unusual accidents affecting the delegates lead Jo to suspect the Ice Warriors. Exploring the tunnels under the palace, the Doctor runs into, and flees from, the creature known as Aggedor. Entering the beast's shrine room, he is discovered by Hepesh. Hepesh accuses the Doctor of sacrilege, who must endure trial by combat, a duel to the death with the royal champion. Later, in the Doctor's cell, Hepesh helps him escape, only to encounter Aggedor again, only this time he calms the beast with a hypnotic device. The Doctor tries to tell Peladon about the beast, but Hepesh again orders that he be taken away to face the royal champion, who is defeated, the Doctor also sparing his life. Arcturus tries to kill the Doctor but is shot by Ssorg. It is revealed that Hepesh, his accomplice, tried to frame the Ice Warriors, and trained Aggedor to maintain superstition, having made an agreement with Arcturus over Peladon's mineral deposits. The vote for intervention carries unanimously, but the delegates cannot communicate with their ships. Hepesh's forces take the throne room and hold Peladon hostage. Hepesh orders him to go back to the old ways or die. The Doctor arrives with Aggedor, who kills Hepesh. On their way to attend Peladon's coronation, the Doctor and Jo see the real delegate from Earth, who has just arrived. They rush back to the TARDIS to avoid explaining themselves. Production The story was broadcast during the 1972 UK Miner's Strike, which led to many parts of the UK undergoing scheduled power cuts. This may account for the drop in viewers for the last two episodes. According to the DVD notes for The Peladon Tales, this industrial action partly inspired the sequel The Monster of Peladon. During production it was noted that Alpha Centauri had a somewhat phallic appearance. So director Lennie Mayne insisted on the addition of a yellow cape to the costume in an attempt to rectify this.\\"The Peladon Saga ‚Äì Part Two\\" ‚Äì DVD Extra for the Peladon Tales boxset Working titles for this story included The Curse and Curse of the Peladons. The original 625-line master videotapes of the serial were wiped around 1975. In the late 1970s, 525-line NTSC copies were returned to the BBC from Canada. The tape of Episode Three was in a very poor condition and a salvage transfer to 625-line was made in 1982 for a repeat of the story; the NTSC tape was then reported to be junked. As a result, it was feared that it might not have been possible to make a new Reverse Standards Conversion (RSC) of the episode. However, the NTSC tape of Episode Three had not been lost but had instead been given to Ian Levine; Levine then lent the tape to the restoration team. After heat treatment, the restored NTSC tape was then used to create a new RSC 625-line videotape digital copy. The \\"Venusian lullaby\\" sung to Aggedor is to the tune of the Christmas carol, \\"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\\". =Cast notes= David Troughton is the son of Second Doctor actor Patrick Troughton. He had previously appeared in Doctor Who as Moor in The War Games (1969), and he would appear in the revived series episode entitled \\"Midnight\\" (2008). Geoffrey Toone previously appeared as Temmosus in the film Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965). Themes and analysis The story can be seen as a political allegory about the real-world issue of whether Britain should join the European Economic Community, with the alien delegates representing Europeans, King Peladon representing a younger generation of hope in agreement with joining the Federation, and Hepesh, who wants to preserve the status quo, representing the decision not to join. An allegory can also be drawn to the conflict of religion and science. Broadcast and reception Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping, in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), described The Curse of Peladon as \\"dull, but worthy\\". In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised the inventiveness and individuality of the aliens, as well as the change of the Ice Warriors from evil to good. They concluded that it was \\"a hugely enjoyable story, and one of the real gems of the third Doctor's era\\". In 2009, Mark Braxton of Radio Times called the story an \\"exciting, elegant four-parter\\". He praised Jo and the various aliens, though he felt Aggedor was less successful and would have been better if he was bigger. DVD Talk's John Sinnott gave the serial four and a half out of five stars, writing that it \\"has everything that a fan could want: some interesting aliens, old adversaries, a solid mystery, a good amount of action, and a healthy dollop of humor\\". He praised the character of Hepesh and effort gone into making the aliens unique, but felt that the King was the weakest aspect as he was not a good leader, which made the romance with Jo not as believable. The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn stated that the serial was a success in returning to an \\"old-fashioned\\" format, but the murder- mystery genre was not fully realised, with the Doctor not figuring it out and Hepesh taking up most of the fourth episode. This story was repeated on BBC One (excluding BBC Wales) as two 50min compilation episodes on 12 and 19 July 1982 as part of \\"Doctor Who and the Monsters\\", achieving viewing figures of 5.2 and 4.2 million respectively. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Brian Hayles, was published by Target Books in January 1975. In 1995 the abridged novel was released by BBC Audio as an audio book, read by Jon Pertwee. An unabridged reading of the novel was released in 2013 on CD by AudioGo, this time read by David Troughton, who had played King Peladon in the TV serial. =Home media= The Curse of Peladon was released on VHS in August 1993 for the series' 30th Anniversary. The story's original soundtrack was released in the UK in November 2007 and linking narration was provided by Katy Manning. The CD also featured a bonus interview with the actress. The serial was released on DVD on 18 January 2010 in a boxset entitled \\"Peladon Tales\\", along with The Monster of Peladon.

After 2010 many telecommunication carriers dropped support for CSD, and CSD has been superseded by GPRS and EDGE (E-GPRS).  Technical  CSD uses a single radio time slot to deliver 9.6 kbit/s data transmission to the GSM network switching subsystem where it could be connected through the equivalent of a normal modem to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), allowing direct calls to any dial-up service. For backwards compatibility, the IS-95 standard also supports CDMA Circuit Switched Data. However, unlike TDMA, there are no time slots, and all CDMA radios can be active all the time to deliver up to 14.4 kbit/s data transmission speeds. With the evolution of CDMA to CDMA2000 and 1xRTT, the use of IS-95 CDMA Circuit Switched Data declined in favour of the faster data transmission speeds available with the newer technologies. Prior to CSD, data transmission over mobile phone systems was done by using a modem, either built into the phone or attached to it. Such systems were limited by the quality of the audio signal to 2.4 kbit/s or less. With the introduction of digital transmission in TDMA-based systems like GSM, CSD provided almost direct access to the underlying digital signal, allowing for higher speeds. At the same time, the speech-oriented audio compression used in GSM actually meant that data rates using a traditional modem connected to the phone would have been even lower than with older analog systems. A CSD call functions in a very similar way to a normal voice call in a GSM network. A single dedicated radio time slot is allocated between the phone and the base station. A dedicated \\"sub-time slot\\" (16 kbit/s) is allocated from the base station to the transcoder, and finally, another time slot (64 kbit/s) is allocated from the transcoder to the Mobile Switching Centre (MSC). At the MSC, it is possible to use a modem to convert to an \\"analog\\" signal, though this will typically actually be encoded as a digital pulse-code modulation (PCM) signal when sent from the MSC. It is also possible to directly use the digital signal as an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) data signal and feed it into the equivalent of a remote access server. High Speed Circuit Switched Data (HSCSD), is an enhancement to Circuit Switched Data (CSD), the original data transmission mechanism of the GSM mobile phone system, four to six times faster than GSM, with data rates up to 57.6 kbit/s. Channel allocation is done in circuit-switched mode, as with CSD. This contrasts with the more widely adopted GPRS. Higher speeds are achieved as a result of superior coding methods, and the ability to use multiple time slots to increase data throughput.  High Speed Circuit Switched Data (HSCSD)  HSCSD is a system based on CSD but designed to provide higher data rates by means of more efficient channel coding and/or multiple (up to 4) time slots. It requires the time slots being used to be fully reserved to a single user. A transfer rate of up to 57.6 kbit/s (i.e., 4 √ó 14.4 kbit/s) can be reached, or even 115 kbit/s if a network allows combining 8 slots instead of just 4. It is possible that either at the beginning of the call, or at some point during a call, it will not be possible for the user's full request to be satisfied since the network is often configured to allow normal voice calls to take precedence over additional time slots for HSCSD users. An innovation in HSCSD is to allow different error correction methods to be used for data transfer. The original error correction used in GSM was designed to work at the limits of coverage and in the worst case that GSM will handle. This means that a large part of the GSM transmission capacity is taken up with error correction codes. HSCSD provides different levels of possible error correction which can be used according to the quality of the radio link. This means that in the best conditions 14.4 kbit/s can be put through a single time slot that under CSD would only carry 9.6 kbit/s, i.e. a 50% improvement in throughput. The user is typically charged for HSCSD at a rate higher than a normal phone call (e.g., by the number of time slots allocated) for the total period of time that the user has a connection active. This makes HSCSD relatively expensive in many GSM networks and is one of the reasons that packet-switched General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), which typically has lower pricing (based on amount of data transferred rather than the duration of the connection), has become more common than HSCSD. Apart from the fact that the full allocated bandwidth of the connection is available to the HSCSD user, HSCSD also has an advantage in GSM systems in terms of lower average radio interface latency than GPRS. This is because the user of an HSCSD connection does not have to wait for permission from the network to send a packet. HSCSD is also an option in Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) systems where packet data transmission rates are much higher. In the UMTS system, the advantages of HSCSD over packet data are even lower since the UMTS radio interface has been specifically designed to support high bandwidth, low latency packet connections. This means that the primary reason to use HSCSD in this environment would be access to legacy dial up systems.  Related  GSM data transmission has advanced since the introduction of CSD: * General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) provides more efficient packet-based data transmission directly from the mobile phone at speeds roughly twice those of HSCSD. * Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) (E-GPRS) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) provide improved radio interfaces with higher data rates, while still being backward compatible with the GSM core network.

She and her husband, Samuel Augustus Barnett, founded the first \\"University Settlement\\" at Toynbee Hall (in the East End of London) in 1884. They also worked to establish the model Hampstead Garden Suburb in the early 20th century. Early life Born in Clapham, London, Henrietta Octavia Weston Rowland lost her mother (Henrietta Monica Margaretta Ditges) at an early age. Her father, Alexander William Rowland, a wealthy businessman associated with the Macassar Oil Company, raised her and seven siblings at their London home and a country house in Kent, where she developed a lifelong appreciation of country pursuits. One of her sisters was the philanthropist Alice Hart. At age 16, Henrietta was sent to a boarding school in Devon run by the Haddon sisters, who, influenced by James Hinton, were committed to social altruism. When her father died in 1869, Henrietta moved with two sisters to Bayswater, where she met and helped social activist and housing reformer Octavia Hill. Hill introduced Henrietta to the writings of John Ruskin, as well as many influential people similarly interested in improving the condition of London's poor. Marriage and activism Through Hill, Henrietta met Canon Samuel Barnett, then the curate of St Mary's, Bryanston Square. They married in 1873. The newlyweds soon moved to the impoverished Whitechapel parish of St Jude's, intent on improving social conditions. Henrietta continued her parish visiting activities, with a focus on women and children, including the more than 2,000 prostitutes then active in Whitechapel alone. In 1875, Henrietta became a woman guardian for the parish, and the following year was named a school manager for the Poor Law district schools in Forest Gate. Another social initiative which the Barnetts helped set up was the Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants (1876), with Jane Senior; the organisation aimed to prevent girls from becoming prostitutes, criminals or alcoholics, and provided domestic servants. The Barnetts' experiment in sending slum children for country holidays grew into the Children's Fresh Air Mission (Off to the Country), established in 1877,Children's Country Holiday Fund, Retrieved 14 January 2017 becoming the Children's Country Holidays Fund in 1884. Henrietta Barnett promoted Homes for Workhouse Girls starting in 1880, and founded the London Pupil Teachers Association in 1891. She also served as vice-president of the National Association for the Welfare of the Feeble-Minded (1895) and National Union of Women Workers (1895‚Äì96). Toynbee Hall 1902 In 1884, the Barnetts established (and began living at) Toynbee Hall, a pioneering university settlement named after the recently deceased distinguished historian Arnold Toynbee, Seth Koven, ‚ÄòBarnett , Dame Henrietta Octavia Weston (1851‚Äì1936)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2013 accessed 14 Jan 2017 who had advocated education of the working classes and reduction of the division between social classes. In 1897 annual loan exhibitions of fine art began at the nearby Whitechapel Gallery through the Barnetts' efforts. In 1903 Richard Tawney began working with them, the Children's Country Holiday Fund, and the Workers' Educational Association. William Beveridge and Clement Attlee also worked with the Barnetts as they started their own careers. A visit to Toynbee Hall inspired Jane Addams to found Hull House in Chicago. Evergreen Hill, Spaniards Road 1 South Square, Hampstead Garden Suburb, former home of Henrietta Barnett In 1889 the activist couple acquired a weekend home at Spaniard's End in the Hampstead area of north-west London. The Barnetts became inspired by Ebenezer Howard and the model housing development movement (then exemplified by Letchworth garden city), as well as protecting part of nearby Hampstead Heath from development by Eton College. In 1904, they established trusts which bought 243 acres of land along the newly opened Northern line extension to Golders Green. This became the Hampstead Garden Suburb, a model garden city developed through their efforts and those of architects Raymond Unwin and Sir Edwin Lutyens and which ultimately grew to encompass over 800 acres. In 1909, an adult education institute opened in the middle of the new Hampstead Garden Suburb, with cultural programmes and discussion groups. Soon a school for girls was established and named the Henrietta Barnett School. Although the suburb was never completely developed according to Lutyens's plan (and soon became a middle class enclave rather than a mixture of classes), it did include Grade I listed St Jude's Church, as well as a clubhouse and a tea house (for non-alcoholic social focus), a Quaker meeting house, children's homes, a nursery school, and housing for old people. The Barnetts never had children of their own. They adopted Dorothy Woods, and Henrietta also served as legal guardian for her brain-damaged elder sister, Fanny. After Samuel died in 1913, Henrietta founded Barnett House at Oxford (1914) in his memory. She helped it become the university's centre for social work and social policy education. Writing Barnett wrote several books, alone and with her husband. Their Christian Socialist beliefs are set out in Practicable Socialism (1889) and Toward Social Reform (1909). Her early books concerned domestic issues: The Making of the Home (1885), How to Mind the Baby, (1887) and, written with her husband and Ernest Abraham Hart (her brother-in-law), The Making of the Body (1894). With Kathleen Mallam, Henrietta Barnett also edited a collection of essays entitled Destitute, Neglected, and Delinquent Children (Pan-Anglican papers, 1908). After her husband's death, Henrietta Barnett finished their Illustrated British Ballads Old and New (1915), wrote his multi-volume biography, Canon Barnett: his life, work and friends (1918) as well as published collections of essays, most notably Matters that Matter (1930). Honours For her work as a social reformer, Barnett was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1917, and elevated to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1924. In 1920, she was named honorary president of the 480 member American Federation of Settlements. Dame Henrietta Barnett memorial, Hampstead Garden Suburb, London NW11 Death and legacy For the final dozen years of her life, Henrietta Barnett took up painting and often lived at 45 Wish Road, Hove (today marked by a blue plaque). She died at Hampstead in 1936 (aged 85) and is buried (with Samuel) in the churchyard of St Helen's Church, Hangleton, East Sussex.

The anchor and escape wheel of a late 19th-century clock. The plate that normally holds the front end of the pinions has been removed for clarity. The pendulum is behind the back plate. In horology, the anchor escapement is a type of escapement used in pendulum clocks. The escapement is a mechanism in a mechanical clock that maintains the swing of the pendulum by giving it a small push each swing, and allows the clock's wheels to advance a fixed amount with each swing, moving the clock's hands forward. The anchor escapement was so named because one of its principal parts is shaped vaguely like a ship's anchor. The anchor escapement was probably invented by British scientist Robert Hooke p.146 around 1657, although some references credit clockmaker William Clement, who popularized the anchor in his invention of the longcase or grandfather clock around 1680. When Clement's clock appeared Hooke claimed the invention of the escapement, saying that he had shown a clock with the same escapement to the Royal Society soon after the great fire of 1666. The oldest known anchor clock is Wadham College Clock, a tower clock built at Wadham College, Oxford, in 1670, probably by clockmaker Joseph Knibb. The anchor became the standard escapement used in almost all pendulum clocks. A more accurate variation without recoil called the deadbeat escapement was invented by Richard Towneley around 1675 and introduced by British clockmaker George Graham around 1715. This gradually superseded the ordinary anchor escapement and is used in most modern pendulum clocks. How it works The anchor escapement consists of two parts: the escape wheel, which is a vertical wheel with pointed teeth on it rather like saw teeth, and the anchor, shaped vaguely like a ship's anchor, which swings back and forth on a pivot just above the escape wheel. On the two arms of the anchor are curved faces which the teeth of the escape wheel push against, called pallets. The central shaft of the anchor is attached to a fork pushed by the pendulum, so the anchor swings back and forth, with the pallets alternately catching and releasing an escape wheel tooth on each side. Each time one pallet moves away from the escape wheel, releasing a tooth, the wheel turns and a tooth on the other side catches on the other pallet, which is moving toward the wheel. The momentum of the pendulum continues to move the second pallet toward the wheel, pushing the escape wheel backward for a distance, until the pendulum reverses direction and the pallet begins to move away from the wheel, with the tooth sliding along its surface, pushing it. Then the tooth slides off the end of the pallet, beginning the cycle again. Neither the anchor escapement nor the deadbeat form, below, are self-starting. The pendulum must be given a swing to get them going. Pendulum and anchor escapement. (a) pendulum rod (b) pendulum bob (c) rate adjustment nut (d) suspension spring (e) crutch (f) fork (g) escape wheel (h) anchor =Recoil= The backward motion of the escape wheel during part of the cycle, called recoil, is one of the disadvantages of the anchor escapement. It results in a temporary reversal of the entire wheel train back to the driving weight with each tick of the clock, causing extra wear in the wheel train, excessive wear to the gear teeth, and inaccuracy. It can also cause the points of the escape wheel teeth to dig into the pallet surface. The teeth are slanted backward, opposite the direction of rotation, and the surface of the pallets is slightly convex, to prevent this. Another reason the escape wheel teeth are slanted backward is as a safety measure. If the clock is moved without immobilising the pendulum, the uncontrolled swinging of the pendulum can cause the anchor pallets to collide violently with the escape wheel. The slanted teeth ensure that the flat faces of the anchor pallets hit the sides of the teeth first, protecting the delicate points from being broken. The deadbeat escapement (below) doesn't have recoil. One way to determine whether an antique pendulum clock has an anchor or deadbeat escapement is to observe the second hand. If it moves backward slightly after every tick, showing recoil, the clock has an anchor escapement. =Crutch and fork= The shaft of the anchor, called the crutch ends in a fork which embraces the shaft of the pendulum, giving it transverse impulses. The pendulum rod is hung from a short straight suspension spring attached to a sturdy support directly behind the anchor. The pivot of the anchor is aligned with the bending point of the spring. This arrangement results in a more stable pendulum support than simply suspending the pendulum directly from the anchor. =Design details= The anchor is very tolerant of variations in its geometry, so its shape varied widely. In late 19th century, in Britain, the usual design was a 90¬∞ angle between the pallets, which meant locating the anchor pivot a distance of ‚âà 1.4 times the escape wheel radius from the escape wheel pivot. In a grandfather clock, which had a pendulum which swung once per second, the escape wheel often had 30 teeth, which made the escape wheel rotate once per minute so the second hand could be attached to its shaft. In a 30 tooth escape wheel the pallets span about 7¬Ω teeth. The impulse angle of the pallets, which determined the swing of the pendulum, was 3¬∞-4¬∞. History The anchor was the second widely used escapement in Europe, replacing the primitive 400-year-old verge escapement in pendulum clocks. The pendulums in verge escapement clocks had very wide swings of 80¬∞ to 100¬∞. In 1673, seventeen years after he invented the pendulum clock, Christiaan Huygens published his mathematical analysis of pendulums, Horologium Oscillatorium. In it he showed that the wide pendulum swings of verge clocks caused them to be inaccurate, because the period of oscillation of the pendulum was not isochronous but varied to a small degree due to circular error with changes in the amplitude of the pendulum's swing, which occurred with unavoidable changes in drive force. The realization that only small pendulum swings were nearly isochronous motivated clockmakers to design escapements with small swings. The chief advantage of the anchor was that by locating the pallets farther from the pivot, the swing of the pendulum was reduced from around 100¬∞ in verge clocks to only 4¬∞-6¬∞. In addition to the improved accuracy due to isochronism, this allowed clocks to use longer pendulums, which had a slower 'beat'. Lower air drag meant they needed less power to keep swinging, and caused less wear on the clock's movement. The anchor also allowed the use of a heavier pendulum bob for a given drive force, making the pendulum more independent of the escapement (higher Q), and thus more accurate. These long pendulums required long narrow clock cases. Around 1680 British clockmaker William Clement began selling the first commercial clocks to use the anchor escapement, tall freestanding clocks with 1 meter (39 inch) seconds pendulums that came to be called longcase or 'grandfather' clocks. The anchor increased the accuracy of clocks so much that around 1680‚Äì1690 the use of the minute hand, formerly the exception in clocks, became the rule.Milham 1945, p.146 The anchor escapement replaced the verge in pendulum clocks within about fifty years, although French clockmakers continued to use verges until about 1800. Many verge clocks were rebuilt with anchors. In the 18th century the more accurate deadbeat form of the escapement replaced the anchor in precision regulators, but the anchor remained the workhorse in home pendulum clocks. During the 19th century the deadbeat form gradually took over in most quality clocks, but the anchor form is still used in a few pendulum clocks today. Disadvantages The anchor escapement is reliable and tolerant of large geometrical errors in its construction, but its operation is similar to the old verge escapement, and retains two of the major disadvantages of the verge: *It is a frictional escapement; the pendulum is always being pushed by an escape wheel tooth throughout its cycle, and never allowed to swing freely. This makes the clock's rate sensitive to changes in the drive force. Any small changes in the force applied to the pallets, for example by a change in lubrication due to oil aging, or the declining force of a clock's mainspring as it runs down, will change the period of the pendulum's swing. Anchor escapement clocks driven by a mainspring required a fusee to even out the force of the mainspring. *It is a recoil escapement as mentioned above; the momentum of the pendulum pushes the escape wheel backward during part of the cycle. This causes extra wear to the movement, and applies varying force to the pendulum, causing inaccuracy. Deadbeat escapement Deadbeat escapement, showing: (a) escape wheel, (b) pallets showing concentric locking faces, (c) crutch. Animation showing deadbeat escapement in motion. (Click to activate) The above two disadvantages were removed with the invention of an improved version of the anchor escapement: the deadbeat or Graham escapement. This is often erroneously credited to English clockmaker George Graham who introduced it around 1715 in his precision regulator clocks.Milham 1945, p.185 Glasgow 1885, p.297 However it was actually invented around 1675 by astronomer Richard Towneley, and first used by Graham's mentor Thomas Tompion in a clock built for Sir Jonas Moore, and in the two precision regulators he made for the new Greenwich Observatory in 1676,Betts, Jonathan Regulators in p.121 mentioned in correspondence between Astronomer Royal John Flamsteed and Towneley Letter 229 Flamsteed to Towneley (September 22, 1675), p.374, and Annotation 11 p.375Andrewes, W.J.H. Clocks and Watches: The leap to precision in p.126, this cites a letter of December 11, but he may have meant the September 22 letter mentioned above. The deadbeat form of the anchor escapement is less tolerant of inaccuracy in its manufacture or wear during operation and was initially used only in precision clocks, but its use spread during the 19th century to most quality pendulum clocks. Almost all pendulum clocks made today use it. Tower clocks are one of the few types of pendulum clock which the anchor escapement did not dominate. The varying force applied to the wheel train by the large exterior hands, exposed to wind, snow, and ice loads, was better handled by gravity escapements. =How it works= The deadbeat escapement has two faces to the pallets, a 'locking' or 'dead' face, with a curved surface concentric with the axis on which the anchor rotates, and a sloping 'impulse' face. When an escape wheel tooth is resting against one of the dead faces, its force is directed through the anchor's pivot axis, so it gives no impulse to the pendulum, allowing it to swing freely. When the pallet on the other side releases the escape wheel, a tooth lands on this \\"dead\\" face first, and remains resting against it for most of the pendulum's outward swing and return. For this period the escape wheel is \\"locked\\" and unable to turn. Near the bottom of the pendulum's swing the tooth slides off the dead face onto the slanted 'impulse' face of the pallet, allowing the escape wheel to turn and give the pendulum a push, before dropping off the pallet. It is still a frictional rest escapement because the sliding of the escape tooth on the dead face adds friction to the pendulum's swing, but it has less friction than the recoil escapement because there is no recoil force. In contrast to the backward slant of the anchor escape wheel teeth, the deadbeat escape wheel teeth are radial or slant forward to ensure that the tooth makes contact with the 'dead' face of the pallet, preventing recoil. =The Airy condition= Clockmakers discovered in the 1700s that for accuracy, the best place to apply the impulse to keep the pendulum swinging was at the bottom of its swing, as it passes through its equilibrium position. If the impulse is applied during the pendulum's downswing, before it reaches the bottom, the impulse force tends to decrease the period of the swing, so an increase in drive force causes the clock to gain time. If the impulse is applied during the pendulum's upswing, after it reaches the bottom, the impulse force tends to increase the period of the swing, so an increase in drive force causes the clock to lose time. In 1826 British astronomer George Airy proved this; specifically he proved that a pendulum that is driven by a drive impulse that is symmetrical about its bottom equilibrium position is isochronous for different drive forces, ignoring friction, and that the deadbeat escapement approximately satisfies this condition.Beckett 1874, p.75-79 It would be exactly satisfied if the escape wheel teeth were made to fall exactly on the corner between the two pallet faces, but for the escapement to operate reliably the teeth must be made to fall above the corner, on the 'dead' face.Beckett 1874, p.75 Comparison of motion in anchor and deadbeat A major cause of error in clocks is changes in the drive force applied to the escapement, caused by small changes in the friction of the gears or the pallets, or the diminishing force of the mainspring as it unwinds. An escapement in which changes in drive force do not affect the rate is called isochronous. The superior performance of the deadbeat over the recoil is due to improved isochronism. This is due to the different ways changes in drive force affect the swing of the pendulum in the two escapements: *In the anchor escapement, an increase of drive force causes the pendulum to swing back and forth more quickly, but does not increase the pendulum's amplitude, the length of its swing, much. The increased force of the escape wheel tooth on the pallet during the recoil part of the cycle tends to decrease the pendulum's swing, while the force of the tooth during the forward impulse part of the cycle tends to increase the pendulum's swing. These tend to cancel each other out, leaving the swing unchanged. But both these effects decrease the time of swing. In other words, increased force knocks the pendulum back and forth in a fixed arc faster. *In the deadbeat escapement, there is no recoil and increased drive force causes the pendulum to swing in a wider arc as well as move faster. The time required to cover the extra distance exactly compensates for the increased speed of the pendulum, leaving the period of swing unchanged. However, the wider swing causes a slight increase in period due to circular error. For domestic clocks this effect is negligible, but it is a limitation on the accuracy that can be achieved by precision regulator clocks with deadbeat escapements. When the deadbeat was invented, clockmakers initially believed it had inferior isochronism to the anchor, because of the greater effect of changes in force on the pendulum's amplitude. Recent analyses point out that the nonisochronism of the anchor can cancel the circular error of the pendulum. That is, an increase in amplitude of swing causes a slight increase in period of a pendulum due to circular error, and that this can compensate for the decreased period due to isochronism. Due to this effect a carefully adjusted anchor escapement with polished pallets might be more accurate than a deadbeat. page 108 This has been confirmed by at least one modern experiment.\\"A Simple Regulator with an Isochronous Combination of Pendulum and Escapement\\" Bernard Tekippe, NAWCC Watch & Clock Bulletin, April 2010, pp131 - 138.

Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593 (1972), was a United States Supreme Court decision affecting educational case law involving tenure and due process. Facts Sindermann was a teacher at several schools in the state college system of the State of Texas under a system of one-year contracts from 1959 to 1969. In 1965, he became a professor at Odessa Junior College, where he was successful enough to be appointed department co-chair for a time. During the 1968-1969 academic year, Sindermann became involved in public disagreements with the policies of the Board of Regents as president of the Texas Junior College Teachers Association. In May 1969, his one-year contract was terminated and was not renewed. The Regents issued a press release alleging insubordination, but no official hearing was provided Sindermann to contest the basis for non-renewal. Issues *Does a non-tenured teacher still have due process rights as provided by the Fourteenth Amendment by a de facto tenure policy created by rules and policy? *Were Sindermann's Fourteenth Amendment due process rights violated? Decision In an opinion written by Justice Stewart, the court decided that Sindermann had alleged enough facts to show that he was entitled to some kind of process and that the lack of a contractual or tenure right taken alone did not defeat his claim that the nonrenewal of his contract violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. While Sindermann did not have tenure per se, his length of service at his last institution (more than the four years mentioned as the probationary period for a full-time instructor in the ‚ÄúPolicy Paper 1‚Äù guidelines), he had asserted that he had de facto tenure. The court pointed to Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564 (1972), as an example of a non-tenured teacher not having a claim for a hearing. However, Sindermann was able to point to the policy paper as providing an expectancy of treatment as if being tenured, the expectancy gave him a viable claim that he had a property interest in the job such that it could fall under the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court ruled that \\"the respondent must be given an opportunity to prove the legitimate of his claim of such entitlement in light of the policies and practices of the institution. Proof of such a property interest would not, of course, entitle him to reinstatement. But such proof would obligate college officials to grant a hearing at his request, where he could be informed of the grounds for his non-retention and challenge their sufficiency.\\" The problem that the court faced was that without having a record of a hearing of Sindermann‚Äôs non- renewal, the court was unable to determine if Sindermann‚Äôs First Amendment right to free speech had been violated since there was no documented reason for the non-renewal. The court required for Sindermann to be given a hearing at which it could be determined if his First Amendment rights had been violated by the Regents' refusal to renew his contract for his public utterances. Justice Powell took no part in the decision. Justice Brennan dissented in part, joined by Justice Douglas, place who wrote that since the respondent was denied due process, he should be entitled to summary judgment on that issue. Justice Marshall also dissented. See also *Speiser v.

He also attended the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1982, Plunkett married Maria Alice Villela de Carvalho, a descendant of the explorer Vasco Da Gama and of Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, the founder of Brazil. Plunkett and his wife, Lady Dunsany, an architect qualified in the US, Ireland and the UK, lived at Dunsany Castle, Dunsany, County Meath, Ireland. They had two sons, Randal Plunkett, 21st Baron of Dunsany, and the Honourable Oliver Plunkett. In addition, Lord Dunsany had two step children Daniel and Joana de Marsillac, who were very close to him and considered as his own. Their father was his first cousin and great friend. The 20th Lord Dunsany died in May 2011, after a some years of chronic illness. A private funeral with his widow, sons and step-children, sister, close family friends and staff, was conducted within the ancestral castle. He was buried in the grounds, by the Church of St. Nicholas, the reconsecration of which he had helped arrange. The pallbearers were his sons and step-son, two members of the Castle staff, and a family friend. A memorial service was held in Dunsany Parish Church a week after the funeral. Career An artist, architect and designer, Dunsany was based in London, Rome, and New York, as well as spending short periods in Brazil and France, before his return to the family estate near the Hill of Tara. Edward Plunkett co-founded de Marsillac Plunkett Inc, Designers and Architects, a New York-based partnership for which he provided design elements for his wife's architectural work. Plunkett was primarily a painter, but also produced sculptures designed by him and manufactured in France or the UK. He was also greatly successful at product design. His last architectural work was the contemporary conversion of an 18th-century wing of Dunsany Castle into a studio and exhibition area. It is called The Plunkett Gallery and it houses Lord Dunsany's paintings, lithographs, drawings, architectural projects, sculptures and designed objects (perfume bottles, Champagne bottles, and numbered editions of vases and dinner services). The gallery is open to visitors by appointment. Plunkett was exhibited on multiple occasions, the last public showing being a one-man exhibition in Rome.

Knight was sent to Rome in 1527 to try to get Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon annulled. He rebuilt Horton Court in Gloucestershire using ideas from Italian architecture. Life Born in London, he entered Winchester School as a scholar in 1487, and proceeded in 1491 to New College, Oxford, where he became Fellow in 1493.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Kandruth-Kyte He afterwards proceeded D.C.L. 12 October 1531. In 1495 Knight went to court, where Henry VII made him one of his secretaries. He was frequently employed as an ambassador in the reign of Henry VIII. On 3 June 1512 he went with Sir Edward Howard to Spain, and, after storms and sickness, reached Valladolid 18 February 1513. He had received a commission authorising him and John Stile to treat with Ferdinand II of Aragon about the defence of the church. Knight remained at Valladolid till June 1513. On 3 April 1514 he was at Mechlin on the first of a long series of embassies to the Low Countries. Richard Wingfield and Spinelly were with him (18 April), and on 12 June he was at The Hague with Sir Edward Poynings. In July he seems to have visited Switzerland. He received, on 14 July 1514, a grant of arms;Party per fess or and gules, an eagle with two heads displayed sable; on its breast a demi-rose and a demi-sun conjoined into one, counterchanged of the field. in the grant he is described as prothonotary. In May 1515 Knight is styled chaplain to the king; in the same year he became dean of the collegiate church of Newark, Leicestershire. On 7 May he was appointed ambassador with Sir Edward Poynings to Prince Charles, to renew the league of 9 February 1505. They had a conference with Cuthbert Tunstall, 23 May, at Bruges, and an audience with Charles at Bergen-op-Zoom on 29 May. He remained in Flanders during the rest of 1515, and found himself short of money. In February 1516 the treaty had been concluded. He probably came to England in 1516, as he was in that year collated to the prebend of Farrendon-cum-Balderton in Lincoln Cathedral. On 30 December 1516 he was, in company with Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, again appointed ambassador to the Emperor, and he had an interview with Charles, 22 January 1517. Throughout 1518 he was English representative to Margaret of Austria in the Low Countries, and sailed home from Calais 15 February 1519. As one of Henry's chaplains and clerk of the closet he was at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520; and seems to have been made prebendary of Llanvair in Bangor Cathedral in the same year. On 10 June 1520 he was commissioned, with Sir Thomas More, John Hussee, and Hewester, to settle the disputes between the English merchants and the Teutonic Hanse, and went again to the Netherlands. Sir Richard Wingfield, writing from Oudenarde, 28 October 1521, reported that Knight was to take his place as ambassador to the emperor, but it seems that the emperor objected to his low birth, and expressed a preference for Sir Robert Wingfield. Knight made a journey on diplomatic business into Switzerland in 1522; went on an embassy to the empire respecting the wool staple, and was (11 November) admitted archdeacon of Chester. In 1523 he concluded with Charles III, Duke of Bourbon a treaty against France, but was back at Brussels in August. On 11 September 1523 he was appointed archdeacon of Huntingdon. About August 1526 he became secretary to the king. In 1527, though he complained that he was old and losing his sight, Henry decided to send him to Rome to promote his divorce; Thomas Wolsey thought Jerome de Ghinucci, bishop of Worcester, would have been better suited to the work. On 10 September Knight saw Wolsey at Compi√®gne, and at his directions went on to Venice to watch for an opportunity to get access to the captive Pope Clement VII. He managed to get a safe- conduct through Gambara the prothonotary, but was nearly murdered at Monterotundo (4 December 1527), and when he entered Rome all he could do was to send in his letters of credence with a note of what the king wished. On 19 December 1527 Knight, while still in Italy, was made canon of Westminster. By the end of December, Henry Jerningham wrote that the secret of Knight's negotiation had not been well kept, and that the Emperor had written to the pope accordingly. Full instructions were then sent to Knight, with a commission to Wolsey and another, which, if signed by the pope, would have empowered them to settle the divorce. On 1 January 1528 the Pope had been set free, and Knight visited him at Orvieto. Cardinal St. Quatuor (to whom two thousand crowns were given) had made some alterations in the commission, and the pope signed it. Knight arrived in London in February 1528 and admitted the failure of this embassy. He went (13 December 1528) on another mission with William Benet to Anne de Montmorency, to confer about Italian affairs, and was instructed to proceed on again to Rome. On 31 January 1529, however, Stephen Gardiner joined Knight and Benet at Lyon and brought new instructions; Knight went back to Paris and acted through March and April with Sir John Taylor as ambassador; in June Suffolk and Fitzwilliam were with him. On 30 June 1529, Knight, with Tunstall, More, and Hacket, arranged the Treaty of Cambray. He was at the convocation of Canterbury of 1529 and was admitted archdeacon of Richmond on 7 December until 1541. In February 1532 Hacket and Knight were appointed to treat with the emperor's commissioners about commerce; the embassy did not bear much fruit. Knight held at this time the rectory of Romald Kirk, Yorkshire. On 30 January 1535 Knight was a commissioner for collecting the ecclesiastical tenths, and on 15 October 1537 was present at the christening of Edward VI. On 29 May 1541 he was consecrated bishop of Bath and Wells, in succession to John Clerk, and he resigned all his other preferments. At Wells Thomas Fuller relates that he built a market cross with the assistance of Dean Woolman. He died in 1547 at Wiveliscombe, Somerset, and was buried in Wells Cathedral next to Sugar's Chapel, where a pulpit which he had erected and which bears his arms served as a monument. He was a patron of Henry Cole. When in London Knight lived in a house in Cannon Row, Westminster, afterwards (1536) assigned, in accordance with an act of 27 Henry VIII, to the bishops of Norwich. By his will he left money to Winchester and New Colleges.

History  Kili Atoll was claimed by the Empire of Germany along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1884. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan. Following the end of World War II, it came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.  Bikini Atoll residents arrive  Kili was uninhabited until November 2, 1948 when the United States government relocated the Bikini Atoll's indigenous population from Rongerik Atoll, where they had previously been relocated after their first relocation to Kwajalein Atoll failed. The islanders had consented to what they believed was temporary use of their island for nuclear tests. They thought they would be able to return to their island home within a few years. On Kwajalein Atoll, the islanders were living in tents on a strip of grass alongside the airport runway. In June 1948 the Bikini residents chose Kili Island as a long-term home. The small island was uninhabited and wasn't ruled by a paramount king, or iroij. In June the Bikini community chose two dozen men to accompany eight Seabees to Kili to begin constructing a village. In November 1948, the residents, now totaling 184 individuals, moved to Kili Island, but soon learned that the new location was incompatible with their traditional diet and lifestyle based on lagoon fishing. In 1957, the Bikini residents, without any legal representation, signed an agreement with the United States that gave the U.S. complete control of Bikini Atoll. The Bikini families also gave up the right for any future claims against the United States. In exchange, they received $25,000 in cash and an additional $300,000 trust fund that yielded a semi-annual interest payment of approximately $5,000, or about $15 per person per year. They were also given Kili Island and several islands in Jaluit Atoll.  Limited sea access  Kili cannot be reached by ship four months out of the year because of rough seas. The grass Kili Airport is served by Air Marshall Islands, although flights have been grounded when its aircraft are not operational, or when the runway is flooded by rising ocean .

In 1949 the Trust Territory administration donated a ship for transporting copra between Kili and Jaluit Atoll. But the ship was washed by heavy surf onto the Kili reef in 1951 and was lost. The main agricultural product of the island is currently copra. Island produce consists of (in descending order of quantity) coconuts, limes, breadfruit, squash, bananas, papayas, and sugar cane. Fishing in the ocean around the island is difficult due to the lack of protection by a lagoon. The small island, about 1/6 the size of Bikini Atoll which is 4 kilometers (2.5 mi) long, also suffers from overpopulation. , the population is approximately 1000, composed primarily of descendants of refugees of Bikini. Residents must import food paid for by a settlement agreement with the United States government to supplement what they can grow locally. Each family on the island receives 2‚Äì3 shipments a year consisting of 1‚Äì2 boxes of frozen chicken, 2‚Äì4 50-lb bags of flour, and 2‚Äì4 bags of rice; this shipment is provided by the Bikinian government in conjunction with the U.S. government. Imports are overseen by the Bikini Public Works Department, which also maintains houses and runs the power plant on the island. There is currently a government effort to increase farming on the island, but the coral reef soil is poor. However, there is a small farm that produces melons and some vegetables. There are several small stores operated out of homes that provide nonperishable food items such as salt, Tabasco, candy, and canned items. Families on Kili live in cinderblock houses with air-conditioning and electricity. Most houses on Kili have kitchens, but many prefer to cook outdoors in cook-huts over an open flame.  Climate change impact  Beginning in 2011 the resettled residents of Kili Island began to experience periods of ocean flooding they attribute to global warming. The highest point of Kili Island is only above sea level. Ocean waves have covered portions of the island at least five times from 2011 to 2015, contaminating all of the wells on the island. The runway servicing the island is unusable during and after rains because it becomes extremely muddy. In August 2015, the Bikini Council passed a resolution requesting assistance from US government to modify terms of the Resettlement Trust Fund for the People of Bikini to be used for the population's relocation once again, this time outside of the Marshall Islands.  Churches and education  Kili has two Christian churches: the Assembly of God and Protestant church. There is an elementary school on Kili for students from Kindergarten to eighth grade. There is a class for each age group, in addition to one class for students with special needs. Classes typically range in size from 6 to 18 students. Some of the teachers are native to Kili, some come from neighboring islands. The Dartmouth Volunteer Teaching Program has placed 2‚Äì4 American volunteer teachers at the school every year since 2000. The teachers provide English language instruction in addition to other curricula because there are few instructional materials or books written in Marshallese. The American volunteers stay and teach for one or more years. Toward the end of their eighth grade year, students must pass a standardized test to gain admission to public high school in Jaluit or Majuro.

It is located to the southeast of the Mare Nubium, in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon. In dimension it is the third-largest crater formation on the visible Moon, being beaten only by Clavius (231 km) and by the 303-kilometer-diameter walled plain Bailly. The northern and eastern parts of the floor display a relatively level surface, but it is pock- marked with numerous craters. There is a small region of mare material, due to basaltic lava, along the eastern interior floor. The crater Walther is attached to the remnant of the eastern rim, and Ball intrudes into the southwestern rim. The crater remnant Lexell has broken across the southeastern rim, forming a \\"harbor\\" in the crater floor due to the wide gap in its northern rim. The irregular crater Regiomontanus is attached to the northeast rim of Deslandres. The crater Hell lies entirely within the western rim. The satellite crater Hell Q lies at the center of a patch of higher albedo surface located in the eastern half of Deslandres. Around the time of the full moon this feature is one of the brightest spots on the lunar surface. The light hue indicates a relatively youthful feature in lunar geological terms. This patch is sometimes referred to as \\"Cassini's bright spot\\", as it was first mapped by Cassini in 1672 at the Paris Observatory. This feature is so heavily eroded and degraded by overlapping impacts that it was not actually recognized as a crater formation until the 20th century. The name for this formation was suggested by Eug√®ne M. Antoniadi in 1942, and was passed during the general assembly of the IAU in 1948. According to one version, Luna 5 impacted lunar surface in this crater (). The first released images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2009 were of the area in the southern part of this crater.

He was best known as the Bikini Killer due to the attire of his victims, as well as the Splitting Killer and the Serpent, due to his skill at deception and evasion. Sobhraj allegedly committed at least a dozen murders and was convicted and jailed in India from 1976 to 1997. After his release, he retired as a celebrity in Paris. Sobhraj later returned to Nepal in 2003, where he was arrested, tried, and received a life sentence. Unlike most violent offenders, Charles Sobhraj did not seem to commit his murders out of uncontrollable, deep seated violent impulses which many serial killers experience, it was more perceived as a byproduct of his audacious and venturesome lifestyle, yet he is still widely believed to have an antisocial personality disorder which is also known as psychopathy. He had an intense hatred of hippies, and many of his murders reflected this. He was described as devilishly handsome, and did not refrain from using his attractiveness to his advantage in his criminal career. This, as well as his cunning and cultured personality, ensured his celebrity status long before his release from prison. He enjoyed his fame, charging large sums for interviews and film rights. He has been the subject of four biographies, three documentaries and a Bollywood movie titled Main Aur Charles. Sobhraj's return to Nepal, where he was still eagerly sought by authorities, is thought to be the result of his yearning for attention and overconfidence in his own intellect. Early years Charles Sobhraj was born as Hatchand Bhaonani Gurumukh Charles Sobhraj to Vietnamese shop girl Tran Loan Phung, and Indian Sindhi businessman Sobhraj Hatchand Bhaonani, who was based in Saigon. His parents were divorced and his father deserted the family. Stateless at first, Sobhraj was adopted by his mother's new boyfriend, a French Army lieutenant stationed in French Indochina. There he was neglected in favour of the couple's later children. However, Sobhraj continued to move back and forth between Indochina and France with the family. As a teenager, he began to commit petty crimes and received his first jail sentence (for burglary) in 1963, serving time at Poissy prison near Paris. While imprisoned, Sobhraj eagerly manipulated prison officials into granting him special favours, such as being allowed to keep books in his cell. Around the same time, he met and endeared himself to Felix d'Escogne, a wealthy young man and prison volunteer.Profile, trutv.com; accessed 1 February 2016. After being paroled, Sobhraj moved in with d'Escogne and shared his time between moving between the high society of Paris and the criminal underworld. He began accumulating riches through a series of burglaries and scams. During this time, Sobhraj met and began a passionate relationship with Chantal Compagnon, a young Parisian woman from a conservative family. Sobhraj proposed marriage to Compagnon, but was arrested later the same day for attempting to evade police while driving a stolen vehicle. He was sentenced to eight months in prison, yet Chantal remained supportive throughout the entirety of his sentence. Sobhraj and Chantal were wed upon his release. Sobhraj, along with a pregnant Chantal, left France in 1970 for Asia to escape arrest. After traveling through Eastern Europe with fake documents, robbing tourists whom they befriended along the way, Sobhraj arrived in Mumbai later the same year. Here, Chantal gave birth to a baby girl, Usha. In the meantime, Sobhraj resumed his criminal lifestyle, running a car theft and smuggling operation. Sobhraj's growing profits went towards his budding gambling addiction. In 1973, Sobhraj was arrested and imprisoned after an unsuccessful armed robbery attempt on a jewellery store at Hotel Ashoka. Sobhraj was able to escape, with Chantal's help, due to faking illness, but was re-captured shortly thereafter. Sobhraj borrowed money for bail from his father, and soon after fled to Kabul.Sobhraj profile, crimeandinvestigation.co.uk; accessed 1 February 2016. There, the couple begun to rob tourists on the Hippie Trail, only to be arrested once again. Again, Sobhraj escaped in the same way he had in India; feigning illness and drugging the hospital guard. Sobhraj then fled to Iran, leaving his family behind. Chantal, although still loyal to Sobhraj, but wishing to leave their criminal past behind, returned to France and vowed never to see him again. Sobhraj spent the next two years on the run, using as many as ten stolen passports. He passed through various countries in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Sobhraj was joined by his younger half-brother, Andr√©, in Istanbul. Sobhraj and Andr√© quickly became partners in crime, participating in various criminal activities in both Turkey and Greece. The duo were eventually arrested in Athens. After an identity-switch hoax went awry, Sobhraj managed to escape, but his half-brother was left behind. Andr√© was turned over to the Turkish police by Greek authorities and served an 18-year sentence. Murders On the run again, Sobhraj financed his lifestyle by posing as either a gem salesman or drug dealer to impress and befriend tourists, whom he then defrauded. In Thailand, Sobhraj met Marie-Andr√©e Leclerc (1945‚Äì1984) from L√©vis, Quebec, Canada, a tourist looking for adventure. Dominated by Sobhraj, she quickly became his most devoted follower, turning a blind eye to his crimes and his philandering with local women. Sobhraj gathered followers by gaining their loyalty: a typical scam was to help his target out of difficult situations. In one case, he helped two former French policemen, Yannick and Jacques, recover missing passports that Sobhraj himself had actually stolen. In another scheme, Sobhraj provided shelter to a Frenchman, Dominique Rennelleau, who appeared to be suffering from dysentery; Sobhraj had actually poisoned Rennelleau. He was finally joined by a young Indian man, Ajay Chowdhury, a fellow criminal who became Sobhraj's second-in- command. Sobhraj and Chowdhury committed their first (known) murders in 1975. Most of the victims had spent some time with the duo before their deaths and were, according to investigators, recruited by Sobhraj and Chowdhury to join the pair in their crimes. Sobhraj claimed that most of his murders were really accidental drug overdoses, but investigators state that the victims had threatened to expose Sobhraj, which was his motive for murder. The first victim was a young woman from Seattle. Teresa Knowlton (named Jennie Bollivar in the book Serpentine) was found drowned in a tidal pool in the Gulf of Thailand, wearing a flowered bikini. It was only months later that Knowlton's autopsy, as well as forensic evidence, proved that her drowning, originally believed to be a swimming accident, was murder. The next victim was a young nomadic Sephardic Jew, Vitali Hakim, whose burnt body was found on the road to the Pattaya resort, where Sobhraj and his growing clan were staying. Dutch students Henk Bintanja, 29, and his fianc√©e Cornelia Hemker, 25, were invited to Thailand after meeting Sobhraj in Hong Kong. They, like many others, were poisoned by Sobhraj, who then nurtured them back to health in order to gain their obedience. As they recovered, Sobhraj was visited by his previous victim Hakim's French girlfriend, Charmayne Carrou, who had come to investigate her boyfriend's disappearance. Fearing exposure, Sobhraj and Chowdhury quickly hustled the couple out. Their bodies were found strangled and burned on 16 December 1975. Soon after, Carrou was found drowned and wearing a similar- styled swimsuit to that of Sobhraj's earlier victim, Teresa Knowlton. Although the murders of both women were not connected by investigations at the time, they would later earn Sobhraj the nickname \\"The Bikini Killer.\\" On 18 December, the day the bodies of Bintanja and Hemker were identified, Sobhraj and Leclerc entered Nepal using the deceased pair's passports. They met in Nepal and, on 21‚Äì22 December, murdered Laurent Carri√®re, 26 (from Canada), and Connie Bronzich, 29 (from the U.S.); the two victims were incorrectly identified in some sources as Laddie DuParr and Annabella Tremont. Sobhraj and Leclerc returned to Thailand, using their latest victims' passports before their bodies could be identified. Upon his return to Thailand, Sobhraj discovered that his three French companions had started to suspect him of serial murder, having found documents belonging to the murder victims. Sobhraj's former companions then fled to Paris after notifying local authorities.The Mammoth Book of Gangs, Mammoth Books, Running Press (26 June 2012); / Sobhraj's next destination was either Varanasi or Calcutta, where he murdered Israeli scholar Avoni Jacob simply to obtain Jacob's passport. Sobhraj used the passport to travel with Leclerc and Chowdhury ‚Äì first to Singapore, then to India, and, in March 1976, returning to Bangkok, despite knowing that the authorities there sought him. The clan was interrogated by Thai policemen in connection with the murders, but released because authorities feared that the negative publicity accompanying a murder trial would harm the country's tourist industry. Meanwhile, Dutch diplomat Herman Knippenberg was investigating the murders of Bintanja and Hemker. Knippenberg had some knowledge of, and had possibly even met, Sobhraj, although the latter's true identity was still unknown to the diplomat, who continued gathering evidence. With the help of a neighbour of Sobhraj, Knippenberg built a case against him. He was eventually given police permission to search Sobhraj's apartment, a full month after the suspect had left the country. Knippenberg found evidence, including victims' documents and passports, as well as poisons and syringes. The trio's next stop was Malaysia, where Chowdhury was sent to steal gems. Chowdhury was observed delivering the gems to Sobhraj. This was the last time he was ever seen, and neither Chowdhury nor his remains were ever found. It is believed that Sobhraj murdered his former accomplice before leaving Malaysia to continue his and Leclerc's roles as gem salesmen in Geneva. A source later claimed to have sighted Chowdhury in West Germany, but the claim appeared unsubstantiated. The search for Chowdhury continues. Soon back in Asia, Sobhraj started to build a new criminal \\"family,\\" starting with two lost Western women, Barbara Smith and Mary Ellen Eather, in Bombay. Sobhraj's next victim was a Frenchman, Jean-Luc Solomon, whose poisoning during a robbery, simply intended to incapacitate him, left him dead. In July 1976 in New Delhi, Sobhraj, joined by his three-woman criminal clan, tricked a tour group of French post-graduate students into accepting them as tour guides. Sobhraj then drugged them by giving them poisoned pills, which he told them were anti-dysentery medicine. When the drugs took effect more quickly than Sobhraj had anticipated, the students began to fall unconscious. Three of the students realized what Sobhraj had done. They overpowered him and contacted the police, leading to his capture. During interrogation, Sobhraj's accomplices, Smith and Eather, quickly buckled and confessed. Sobhraj was charged with the murder of Solomon, and all four were sent to Tihar prison, New Delhi while awaiting formal trial. Prison time Smith and Eather attempted suicide in prison during the two years before their trial. Sobhraj had entered with precious gems concealed in his body and was experienced in bribing captors and living comfortably in jail. He turned his trial into a spectacle, hiring and firing lawyers at whim, bringing in his recently paroled brother Andr√© to assist, and eventually going on a hunger strike. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison. Leclerc was found guilty of drugging the French students, but was later paroled and returned to Canada when she developed ovarian cancer. She was still claiming her innocence and was reportedly still loyal to Sobhraj when she died at her home in April 1984. Sobhraj's systematic bribery of prison guards at Tihar reached outrageous levels. He led a life of luxury inside the jail, with television and gourmet food, having befriended both guards and prisoners. He gave interviews to Western authors and journalists, such as Oz magazine's Richard Neville in the late 1970s, and Alan Dawson in 1984. He freely talked about his murders, while never actually admitting to them, and pretended that his actions were in retaliation against \\"Western imperialism\\" in Asia. When Sobhraj's sentence was to end, the twenty-year Thai arrest warrant against him would still have been valid, thereby affecting his extradition and almost certain execution. So in March 1986, in his tenth year in prison, Sobhraj threw a big party for his guards and fellow inmates, drugged them with sleeping pills and walked out of the jail. Inspector Madhukar Zende of the Mumbai police apprehended Sobhraj in O'Coquero Restaurant in Goa; his prison term was prolonged by ten years, just as he had hoped. On 17 February 1997, 52-year-old Sobhraj was released with most warrants, evidence and even witnesses against him long lost. Without any country to extradite him to, Indian authorities let him return to France. Celebrity and re-capture Sobhraj retired to a comfortable life in suburban Paris. He hired a publicity agent and charged large sums of money for interviews and photographs. He is said to have charged over $US15 million (according to advocate and former police inspector Bishwa Lal Shrestha, who investigated the case, framed the charge sheet and registered the case in court) for the rights to a movie based on his life. On 17 September 2003, Sobhraj was seen in a street of Kathmandu by a journalist. The journalist quickly reported this to the Nepalese authorities, who arrested him two days later in the casino of the Yak and Yeti hotel. Sobhraj's motives for returning to Nepal remain unknown. He was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Kathmandu district court on 20 August 2004 for the murders of Bronzich and Carri√®re in 1975. Most of the photocopy evidence used against him in this case was from that gathered by Knippenberg, the Dutch diplomat, and Interpol. He appealed against the conviction, claiming that he was sentenced without trial. His lawyer also announced that Chantal, Sobhraj's wife in France, was filing a case before the European Court of Human Rights against the French government for refusing to provide him with any assistance. Sobhraj's conviction was confirmed by the Patan Court of Appeals in 2005. Current status In late 2007, news media reported that Sobhraj's lawyer had appealed to the then French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, for intervention with Nepal. In 2008, Sobhraj announced his engagement to a Nepali woman Nihita Biswas (who later participated in the reality show Bigg Boss). On 7 July 2008, issuing a press release through his fianc√©e Nihita, he claimed that he was never convicted of murder by any court and asked the media not to refer to him as a serial killer. It was claimed that Sobhraj married his fianc√©e on 9 October 2008 in jail on Bada Dashami, a Nepalese festival. On the following day, Nepalese jail authorities dismissed the claim of his marriage. They said that Nihita and her family had been allowed to conduct a tika ceremony, along with the relatives of hundreds of other prisoners. They further claimed that it was not a wedding but part of the ongoing Dashain festival, when elders put the vermilion mark on the foreheads of those younger to them to signify their blessings. In July 2010, the Supreme Court of Nepal postponed the verdict on an appeal filed by Sobhraj against a district court's verdict sentencing him to life imprisonment for the murder of American backpacker Connie Jo Bronzich in 1975. Sobhraj had appealed against the district court's verdict in 2006, calling it unfair and accusing the judges of racism while handing out the sentence. On 30 July 2010 the Supreme Court upheld the verdict issued by the district court in Kathmandu of a life sentence for the murder of Connie Jo Bronzich and another year, plus a Rs 2,000 fine for entering Nepal illegally. The seizure of all Sobhraj's properties was also ordered by the court. Sobhraj‚Äôs ‚Äúwife‚Äù Nihita and ‚Äúmother- in-law‚Äù Shakuntala Thapa, a lawyer, expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict, with Thapa claiming that Sobhraj had been \\"denied\\" justice and that the \\"judiciary is corrupt.\\" They were charged and sent to judicial custody for contempt of court because of these remarks. On 18 September 2014, Sobhraj was convicted in Bhaktapur district court of the murder of Canadian tourist Laurent Carri√®re. In 2018, Sobhraj was in critical condition, and had been operated on multiple times. He has received several open heart surgeries, and is scheduled for more. In popular culture * Sobhraj has been the subject of three nonfiction books, Serpentine (1979) by Thomas Thompson,The Life and Crimes of Charles Sobrhaj (1980) by Richard Neville and Julie Clarke. and the section titled \\"The Bikini Murders\\" by Noel Barber in the Reader's Digest collection Great Case of Interpol (1982). Neville and Clarke's book was the basis for a 1989 made-for-TV movie, Shadow of the Cobra. * The 2015 Bollywood film Main Aur Charles, directed by Prawaal Raman and Cyznoure Network, is reportedly based on Charles Sobhraj's escape from Tihar Jail, New Delhi.

Herold crossed the grape varieties Helfensteiner and Heroldrebe, the latter which bears his name, to create Dornfelder.Vitis International Variety Catalogue: Dornfelder , accessed on May 29, 2008 Helfensteiner (Fr√ºhburgunder/Pinot Noir Pr√©coce √ó Trollinger/Schiava Grossa) and Heroldrebe (Blauer Portugieser √ó Blaufr√§nkisch/Lemberger) were both crosses created some decades earlier by Herold. Dornfelder received varietal protection and was released for cultivation in 1979. It was named in honor of Immanuel August Ludwig Dornfeld (1796‚Äì1869), a senior civil servant who was instrumental in creating the viticultural school in Weinsberg.Wein-Plus Glossar: Dornfelder, accessed on March 6, 2013 Traditionally, the red wines of Germany were mostly pale and light-bodied, but new breeds of dark-skinned grapes led by Dornfelder have allowed the production of more internationally styled reds. Dornfelder has a depth of color, good acidity and the ability to benefit from barrique aging and the associated oak flavours. In comparison to traditional red wine varieties of Germany, Dornfelder is easier to grow than Sp√§tburgunder, has better resistance to rot than Blauer Portugieser (as well as deeper color, more powerful flavours and more tannin), has stronger stalks than Trollinger, ripens earlier than Lemberger, and achieves higher must weights, i.e., higher natural alcohol levels than most of these varieties. Dornfelder can be very productive, and yield up to 120 hectoliter per hectare, but quality-conscious producers typically keep yields much lower. Higher-quality Dornfelder wines are velvety textured, slightly floral, often show flavours of plums, blackberries or cherries, and are typically oaked. Sometimes the wines have a hint of sweetness. Dornfelder is the second most grown red wine grape variety in Germany. Steadily increased plantings throughout the 1980s and 1990s allowed it to overtake Blauer Portugieser in 2001. It has established itself in most German regions, and been particularly successful in Rheinhessen and the Palatinate. In 2006, Dornfelder was grown on in Germany, and no longer has an increasing trend.German Wine Institute: German Wine Statistics 2007-2008 History and relationship to other grapes The family tree of Dornfelder showing its parent and grandparent varieties. Dornfelder was created in 1956 at the Weinsberg Research Center in Baden-W√ºrttemberg by German grape breeder August Herold. The variety was created as a cross of two Vitis vinifera crossing previously created by Herold, Helfensteiner (a cross of Fr√ºhburgunder/Pinot Pr√©coce noir and Trollinger/Schiava Grossa created in 1931) and Heroldrebe (a cross of Blauer Portugieser and Blaufr√§nkisch/Lemberger created in 1929). The variety was named after one of the 19th century founders of the school of viticulture at Weinsberg, Immanuel August Ludwig Dornfeld.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 307-308 Allen Lane 2012 Originally created as a blending variety to add color to the pale red wines of Germany, plantings of Dornfelder were initially slow to take off. By 1970 there was only around of the variety planted.Appellation America \\"Dornfelder\\", varietal profiles, Accessed: November 25th, 2013 The grape was officially approved for German wine production in 1980 with plantings rapidly increasing throughout the rest of the 20th century. From 2000 to 2005-2006, plantings again doubled as wine produced from Dornfelder earn commercial success. As a successful vinifera crossing, Dornfelder was used as a parent variety to create several new varieties including Acolon (a 1971 crossing with Blaufr√§nkisch), Cabernet Dorio (a 1971 crossing with Cabernet Sauvignon), Cabernet Dorsa (another 1971 crossing with Cabernet Sauvignon) and Monarch (a 1988 crossing with Solaris). Viticulture Dornfelder was bred to be a vigorous and high yielding grape variety, easily capable of producing up to 120 hl/ha (‚âà 6 tons/acre), with a high concentration of color phenolics that can contribute to producing a darker colored red wine than what was typically found in German wine regions. The variety tends to be an early to mid budding and ripening grapevine with thick skins that give it good resistance to the viticultural hazards of fungal infections such as botrytis bunch rot. Wine regions A vineyard of Dornfelder vines in Devon County in southwest England. Most plantings of Dornfelder can be found in its viticultural homeland of Germany where there were plantings of the grape in production in 2012. Nearly of those plantings were found in Germany's two largest wine regions, the Palatinate and Rheinhessen. From Germany, plantings of Dornfelder spread in the late 20th century to nearby Switzerland where, by 2009, there were found mostly in the cantons of Schwyz and Z√ºrich. The grape was first introduced to England in the late 1980s where it has mostly been used for ros√©s and sparkling wine production. While some English producers do make light bodied red wines, its use for red wine production has largely fallen out of favor as the hybrid grape Regent gains in popularity. By 2007 there were an estimated in England. In the Czech Republic, there are some limited plantings of Dornfelder. Outside of Europe, Dornfelder can be found in the Lodi and Sta. Rita Hills AVA of California, the Finger Lakes AVA of New York as well as in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Plantings of the grape can also be found in Canada in the British Columbia wine region of Vancouver Island. In the Rio Grande do Sul region of Brazil, some South American wine producers are experimenting with the variety as are Japanese winemakers on the island of Hokkaido where there of Dornfelder in production as of 2009. Styles A Dornfelder wine from Germany. Due to its thick skins that are high in phenolic compounds, such as anthocyanins, Dornfelder tends to produce deeply colored red wines that can have a soft, rich texture in the mouthfeel. The wine usually have a fair amount of acidity with some examples showing floral aroma notes. The overall quality of the wines produced from Dornfelder tend to be dependent on harvest yields with wines produced from lower yields being more likely to have the concentration of fruit needed to complement a period of oak aging that can add more body and complexity to the wine. Early in its history, German producers would use Dornfelder to make Beaujolais nouveau style wine using carbonic maceration to make a light bodied, fruity wine, sometimes with a bit of residual sugar. Today, most examples of Dornfelder are fermented dry, though some off-dry examples exist, with flavors of sour cherry and blackberries. Synonyms The only known synonyms for Dornfelder are its breeding codes Weinsberg S 341 and We S 341. S for seedling, WE S for Weinsberg seedling.

The band split in 2005 after releasing a four-song EP, which was available on their website. Their website hasn't seen an update since December 2004, and their touring has ceased. History Aaron Evil, guitar (Aaron Barrett), of Reel Big Fish fame, formed The Forces Of Evil in January 2001 by recruiting three members of the then recently defunct ska group Jeffries Fan Club at their farewell concert, Justin Evil, drums (Justin Ferreira), Chris Evil, trombone (Chris Colonnier) and Derek Evil, bass (Derek Gibbs). Jay Evil, trumpet (Jay Lafayette of The Scholars) and Jonny Evil, trombone (John Throop of Lone Raspberry) were later added to the line-up, and with the addition of friend John Evil, trumpet (John Christianson), the band was made complete. Between formation and June 2002, the band played many concerts across the U.S., playing both songs written by the band and covers of other songs from many genres. In June 2002, the band released their first record, an EP titled Because We Care..., featuring tracks that had seen popular receptions during concerts. The first album to be released by The Forces Of Evil appeared in October 2003, titled Friend Or FOE? and featuring all of the tracks previously released on the EP as well as many new tracks, one of particular note being \\"Fight\\", which was the theme song for Ska Summit 2003, a huge achievement for such a newly formed band and one that served to increase the group's popularity not only in US Ska circles but also in Ska fans across the world. As such, the band was signed by Jive Records. As of March 2005, The Forces Of Evil were still recording their second album for Jive Records. According to their online message boards, The Forces of Evil have broken up. This has not been confirmed, though is supported by the fact that they released a Four Song Obituary album available freely on the web. Barrett has stated that the Forces of Evil are finished as a band. He said that the work effort was too similar to the work he was doing with Reel Big Fish, and he has decided to concentrate his efforts on the other band. Both John Christianson and Derek Gibbs subsequently started playing in Reel Big Fish officially. Barrett also said that the Forces of Evil was just a fall- back plan because he believed that Reel Big Fish was going to tank after releasing Cheer Up! because he thought everyone would hate it. He said he started FoE because \\"if Reel Big Fish was over, then I'd still want to prove to everyone that I still love ska and love to play it.\\" This was said in the commentary of Reel Big Fish's DVD You're All In This Together in their new live album \\"Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album.\\" Barrett also noted the president of Jive at the time of the release of Friend or Foe? was angered by the fact that it was not the new Reel Big Fish album, and wondered why it wasn't. Former Reel Big Fish bassist Matt Wong said he wondered the same thing as well.

His novel The Town (1950), the last story of his trilogy The Awakening Land about the Ohio frontier, won the 1951 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. His novel The Waters of Kronos won the 1961 National Book Award for Fiction. Two collections of short stories were published posthumously during the 20th century, and several of his novels have been reissued during the 21st century by academic presses. Early life Conrad Michael Richter was born in 1890 in Tremont, Pennsylvania, near Pottsville, to John Absalom Richter, a Lutheran minister, and Charlotte Esther (n√©e Henry) Richter. His grandfather, uncle and great-uncle were also Lutheran ministers, and descended from German colonial immigrants. As a child, Richter lived with his family in several small central Pennsylvania mining towns, where he encountered descendants of pioneers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who shared family stories. These inspired him later to write historical fiction set on changing American frontiers. Attending local public schools, Richter finished his formal education when he graduated at age fifteen from high school.Conrad Richter . Ohioana Authors Early career, marriage and move to New Mexico At the age of 19, Richter started working as an editor of a local weekly newspaper, the Patton, Pennsylvania Courier. In 1911 Richter relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, and worked as the private secretary to a wealthy manufacturing family. Richter married Harvena Maria Achenbach in 1915. They had their only child, Harvena Richter, in 1917. Richter worked subsequently for a small publishing company, initiated a juvenile magazine, and started writing short stories. During the 1930s, he also performed two brief stints as a screenwriter for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in Hollywood, California. Richter continued writing and trying to sell short stories. His short story \\"Brothers of No Kin,\\" published in Forum magazine in 1914, was included in the \\"Roll of Honor for 1914\\" of American stories by Edward J. O'Brien, editor of the Best Short Stories of 1915. O'Brien wrote in his \\"Introduction\\" that Richter's story was the best of all those published in 1914; the editor was explicitly concerned with the development of an \\"American literature\\" and considered Richter as integral to this.Edward J. O'Brien (editor), \\"Introduction\\", Best Short Stories of 1915, Boston: Small, Maynard & Company, 1915, e-text online at Gutenberg Project This short story was re-issued as the title story of a posthumous collection published in 1973. In 1928 Richter relocated to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for the sake of his wife's health.David R. Johnson, Conrad Richter , Penn State Press, 2001 During this period, he also collected much material from which he created short stories about the Southwest frontier days. By 1933, Richter and his wife had returned to live in his hometown of Pine Grove, Pennsylvania. They subsequently alternated between Pine Grove, Albuquerque, and Florida.Overview, Paperback version of The Waters of Kronos, Pennsylvania State University Press, 2003 Writing career During the early 1930s, Richter had numerous stories published in pulp magazines such as Triple-X, Short Stories, Complete Stories, Ghost Stories, and Blue Book.Conrad Richter (American Society of Authors and Writers)Conrad Richter author spotlight(Random House, Inc.) His Early Americana and Other Stories (1936) was considered his first successful book. He persisted with his work, gradually writing and publishing full-length novels. Richter set his novels in different periods of American history on its changing frontier. He may be best known for The Sea of Grass (1936), set in late nineteenth-century New Mexico, and featuring conflict between ranchers and farmers. It was later adapted as a movie of the same name, directed by Elia Kazan and featuring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, released in 1947. Richter's novel The Light in the Forest (1953), set in late eighteenth-century Pennsylvania and Ohio, featured challenges faced by a young white man who had become an assimilated Lenape Amerindian after being taken captive as a child. After the boy was returned as a youth to white culture, he was considered suspicious. This novel also became very popular and had a second life as a movie, released in 1958. Richter returned to the topic of the white child raised in an alien culture in his later novel A Country of Strangers (1966). As noted by Ernest Cady in his review in the Columbus Dispatch, both books were written from the point of view of Indians. He wrote of Richter, > He simply tells how he thinks things were for both Indians and whites, in a > hard time of violence and danger and change on a raw frontier. And does it > so convincingly that the reader senses that this indeed, is how it must have > been. During this period, Richter also published the novels of his trilogy The Awakening Land, about the Ohio frontier: The Trees (1940), The Fields (1946), and The Town (1950). In 1947 he won the Ohioana Book Award for The Fields. The Town was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1951.\\"Fiction\\", Past winners & finalists by category. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2012-03-28. In a review of the last novel, Louis Bromfield, also an Ohio writer and winner of the Pulitzer Prize, wrote of the trilogy: > the three books are not only concerned with Sayward and her family but the > growth and the astonishingly rapid development of a whole area which has > played a key role in the nation's history‚Ä¶ Mr. Richter has reproduced the > quality and the speech of these people so well that a thousand years from > now, one may read his books and know exactly what these people were like and > what it was like to have lived in an era when within three or four > generations a frontier wilderness turned into one of the great industrial > areas of the earth‚Ä¶.

The trilogy was first published in one volume in 1966 by Alfred A. Knopf. It was adapted as a TV miniseries of the same name in 1978, in which several plot changes were made as a result of the changing social culture of the time, especially concerning race and sexuality. Richter's short story, \\"Doctor Hanray's Second Chance\\", first published in the magazine The Saturday Evening Post in 1950 (June 10), has a theme of reconciling with the past. Richter returned to this theme in his 1960 autobiographical novel, The Waters of Kronos (Chronos). (Chronos was the ancient Greek personification of Time.) This novel won the U.S. National Book Award in 1961.\\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1961\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-28.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays, Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers, Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox and San Francisco Giants. Amateur career Quir√≥z was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela on November 29, 1981. He played Little League Baseball for Cocquivacoa, and was teammates with Yusmeiro Petit. In 1994, Cocquivacoa won Venezuela's first Little League World Series title. Then aged 10, Quir√≥z started every game that season as a catcher. Two year later, Quir√≥z won the Senior League World Series. Professional career =Toronto Blue Jays= Quir√≥z was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays as a non-drafted free agent in 1998, before his 17th birthday, with a $1 million signing bonus. He progressed through Toronto's system as the team's number-one catching prospect. In addition, Baseball America rated him as the Blue Jays' third best prospect in their 2004 pre-season rankings, and the 35th best prospect in all of baseball. Defensively, Quir√≥z has good skills. In 2003, he threw out 45% of base stealers, and was the starting catcher for the World Team in the 2003 All-Star Futures Game. He missed the end of the 2003 season with a collapsed lung. The broken hand and torn arm muscle he suffered in 2004 hurt his chances of taking over as the Blue Jays' starting catcher in 2005. Gregg Zaun and Greg Myers were re-signed to give Quir√≥z more time in the minors. However, Quir√≥z was set further back that season, due to shoulder strain and another collapsed lung. In 2006, the Blue Jays signed catcher Jason Phillips initially as the backup to Gregg Zaun. They later signed Bengie Molina to be their new starter. This placed three catchers ahead of Quir√≥z on the Blue Jays' depth chart. =Seattle Mariners= On March 31, 2006, Quir√≥z was put on waivers by the Blue Jays, but was picked up by the Seattle Mariners on the same day. Quir√≥z started the seventh game of the 2006 season for the Mariners, but was outrighted to Triple-A Tacoma Rainers eight days later. Quir√≥z spent the rest of the season between Triple-A Tacoma and the Double-A San Antonio Missions. =Texas Rangers= Quir√≥z was signed by the Texas Rangers on December 28, 2006. He spent most of the 2007 season with the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks until a September call-up to the majors. At the end of the 2007 season, the Rangers outrighted Quir√≥z to the minors, but he refused the assignment and became a free agent. Baltimore Orioles in 2008 =Baltimore Orioles= On December 3, 2007, Quir√≥z signed a one-year major league contract with the Baltimore Orioles. He spent the 2008 season as the backup to catcher Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez. He was invited to spring training and expected to compete for the backup catcher position at the start of the 2009 season, but was released on March 21. =Second stint with Mariners= In April 2009 Quir√≥z signed a minor league deal with the Seattle Mariners. On May 14, 2009, he was assigned to the Double-A West Tenn Diamond Jaxx from the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers. On May 26, 2009, he was called up from West Tenn to the Seattle Mariners. On June 19, 2009, Quir√≥z was designated for assignment. He refused an assignment to the Rainers at the end of the season and became a free agent on November 3, 2010. =San Diego Padres= On January 5, 2011, Quir√≥z signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres. He was invited to spring training to be the backup to Nick Hundley, but did not win the job and spent the season playing for the Tucson Padres. =Third Stint with Mariners= Quir√≥z signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners on December 13, 2011. He received an invitation to spring training, but did not play for the Mariners in 2012. Instead he played for their Triple-A affiliate Tacoma Rainiers. =Boston Red Sox= On September 4, 2012, the Mariners traded Quir√≥z to the Boston Red Sox for cash considerations. Quir√≥z was designated for assignment on October 4. According to the International League transactions page, Quir√≥z was outrighted to the Pawtucket Red Sox on October 10, but chose to become a free agent. =San Francisco Giants= He signed a minor league deal with an invite to spring training with the San Francisco Giants in November 2012. On May 4, 2013 Quir√≥z hit his first career walk-off home run, a tenth inning, pinch-hit homer against former battery mate Brandon League of the Los Angeles Dodgers, leading the Giants to a 10-9 victory. On November 15, 2013 Quir√≥z signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. In November 2014 Quir√≥z was outrighted to Triple A. He refused the assignment and became a free agent on November 3, then subsequently re-signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. =Cleveland Indians= On February 12, 2016, Quir√≥z signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians with an invitation to spring training. He signed another minor league contract with the Indians organization in November 2016. He was released on March 29, 2017. =Coaching Career= Quir√≥z was named a coach for the Triple-A Charlotte Knights for the 2019 season.

Its invention is important in the history of technology, because it made possible the development of all-mechanical clocks. This caused a shift from measuring time by continuous processes, such as the flow of liquid in water clocks, to repetitive, oscillatory processes, such as the swing of pendulums, which had the potential to be more accurate., p.31 Oscillating timekeepers are used in all modern timepieces. Verge and foliot clocks One of the earliest existing drawings of a verge escapement, in Giovanni de Dondi's astronomical clock, the Astrarium, built 1364, Padua, Italy. This had a balance wheel (crown shape at top) instead of a foliot. The escapement is just below it. From his 1364 clock treatise, Il Tractatus Astrarii. The verge escapement dates from 13th-century Europe, where its invention led to the development of the first all-mechanical clocks. Starting in the 13th century, large tower clocks were built in European town squares, cathedrals, and monasteries. They kept time by using the verge escapement to drive the foliot, a primitive type of balance wheel, causing it to oscillate back and forth. The foliot was a horizontal bar attached to the vertical verge rod with weights near the ends and the rate of the clock could be adjusted by moving the weights in or out on the bar. The verge probably evolved from the alarum, which used the same mechanism to ring a bell and had appeared centuries earlier., p.103-104 There has been speculation that Villard de Honnecourt invented the verge escapement in 1237 with an illustration of a strange mechanism to turn an angel statue to follow the sun with its finger,MS. 19093, folio 44, French Collection, Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris (No. 1104 Library of Saint-Germain-des Pr√©s until c.1800). Villard_de_Honnecourt_-_Sketchbook_-_44.jpg is an image of the page on Wikimedia Commons but the consensus is that this was not an escapement., footnote 7, footnote 3 It is believed that sometime in the late 13th century the verge escapement mechanism was applied to tower clocks, creating the first mechanical escapement clock. In spite of the fact that these clocks were celebrated objects of civic pride which were written about at the time, it may never be known when the new escapement was first used. This is because it has proven difficult to distinguish from the meager written documentation which of these early tower clocks were mechanical, and which were water clocks; the same Latin word, horologe, was used for both.White 1966, p.124 None of the original mechanisms have survived unaltered. Sources differ on which was the first clock 'known' to be mechanical, depending on which manuscript evidence they regard as conclusive. One candidate is the Dunstable Priory clock in Bedfordshire, England built in 1283, because accounts say it was installed above the rood screen, where it would be difficult to replenish the water needed for a water clock. Another is the clock built at the Palace of the Visconti, Milan, Italy, in 1335., p.196 Astronomer Robertus Anglicus wrote in 1271 that clockmakers were trying to invent an escapement, but hadn't been successful yet.White, 1966, pp. 126-127. However, there is agreement that mechanical clocks existed by the late 13th century.Whitrow 1989, p.104 The earliest description of an escapement, in Richard of Wallingford's 1327 manuscript Tractatus Horologii Astronomici on the clock he built at the Abbey of St. Albans, was not a verge, but a variation called a 'strob' escapement. It consisted of a pair of escape wheels on the same axle, with alternating radial teeth. The verge rod was suspended between them, with a short crosspiece that rotated first in one direction and then the other as the staggered teeth pushed past. Although no other example is known, it is possible that this design preceded the more usual verge in clocks. For the first two hundred years or so of the mechanical clock's existence, the verge, with foliot or balance wheel, was the only escapement used in mechanical clocks. In the sixteenth century alternative escapements started to appear, but the verge remained the most used escapement for 350 years until mid-17th century advances in mechanics, resulted in the adoption of the pendulum, and later the anchor escapement. Since clocks were valuable, after the invention of the pendulum many verge clocks were rebuilt to use this more accurate timekeeping technology, so very few of the early verge and foliot clocks have survived unaltered to the present day. How accurate the first verge and foliot clocks were is debatable, with estimates of one to two hours error per day being mentioned, although modern experiments with clocks of this construction show accuracies of minutes per day were achievable.W. Houtkooper \\"The Accuracy of the Foliot\\" Antiquarian Horology Vol. 20 No. One, Spring 1992M. Maltin \\"Some notes on the Medieval Clock in Salisbury Cathedral\\" Antiquarian Horology Vol. 20 No. 5, Spring 1993 Early verge clocks were probably no more accurate than the previous water clocks, but they did not freeze in winter and were a more promising technology for innovation. By the mid-17th century, when the pendulum replaced the foliot, the best verge and foliot clocks had achieved an accuracy of 15 minutes per day. Verge pendulum clocks Most of the gross inaccuracy of the early verge and foliot clocks was not due to the escapement itself, but to the foliot oscillator. The first use of pendulums in clocks around 1656 suddenly increased the accuracy of the verge clock from hours a day to minutes a day. Most clocks were rebuilt with their foliots replaced by pendulums,Milham 1945, p.144 to the extent that it is difficult to find original verge and foliot clocks intact today. A similar increase in accuracy in verge watches followed the introduction of the balance spring in 1658.  How it works  The second verge pendulum clock built by Christiaan Huygens, inventor of the pendulum clock, 1673. Huygens claimed an accuracy of 10 seconds per day. In a pendulum clock, the verge escapement is turned 90 degrees so that the crown wheel faces up (top). The verge escapement consists of a wheel shaped like a crown, called the escape wheel, with sawtooth-shaped teeth protruding axially toward the front, and with its axis oriented horizontally. In front of it is a vertical rod, the verge, with two metal plates, the pallets, that engage the teeth of the escape wheel at opposite sides. The pallets are not parallel, but are oriented with an angle in between them so only one catches the teeth at a time. The verge is fixed to an oscillator such as a pendulum, balance wheel or, in its earliest form, a foliot. Once set into motion, the verge oscillates on its axis, stopping and releasing the escape wheel alternately to advance the gears of the train at a constant rate therefore providing a timekeeping standard. The verge stops the escape wheel by catching one of its teeth with a pallet, say the top pallet for the purpose of the following explanation. The motion of the verge subsequently disengages the top pallet from the escape wheel, allowing the latter to rotate freely for a brief duration until it comes into contact with the bottom pallet which will have moved in its way to catch another of its teeth thus stopping it again. The rotation of the verge then changes direction and disengages on its way back the bottom pallet from the escape wheel, which then rotates freely until coming into contact with the top pallet once again, completing a cycle. The escape wheel in turn provides an impulse to the verge every time it is released from a pallet, replacing the energy lost by the latter due to friction and therefore allowing its continued oscillatory motion. The escape wheel must have an odd number of teeth for the escapement to function. With an even number, two opposing teeth will contact the pallets at the same time, jamming the escapement. The usual angle between the pallets was 90¬∞ to 105¬∞, resulting in a foliot or pendulum swing of around 80¬∞ to 100¬∞. In order to reduce the pendulum's swing to make it more isochronous, the French used larger pallet angles, upward of 115¬∞. This reduced the pendulum swing to around 50¬∞ and reduced recoil (below), but required the verge to be located so near the crown wheel that the teeth fell on the pallets very near the axis, reducing initial leverage and increasing friction, thus requiring lighter pendulums., p.391-392 Disadvantages As might be expected from its early invention, the verge is the most inaccurate of the widely used escapements. It suffers from these problems: * Verge watches and clocks are sensitive to changes in the drive force; they slow down as the mainspring unwinds. This is called lack of isochronism. It was much worse in verge and foliot clocks due to the lack of a balance spring, but is a problem in all verge movements. In fact, the standard method of adjusting the rate of early verge watches was to alter the force of the mainspring. The cause of this problem is that the crown wheel teeth are always pushing on the pallets, driving the pendulum or balance wheel throughout its cycle; the timekeeping element is never allowed to swing freely. Thus a decreasing drive force causes the pendulum or balance wheel to swing back and forth more slowly. All verge watches and spring driven clocks required fusees to equalize the force of the mainspring to achieve even minimal accuracy. * The escapement has \\"recoil\\", meaning that the momentum of the foliot or pendulum pushes the crown wheel backward momentarily, causing the clock's wheel train to move backward, during part of its cycle. This increases friction and wear, resulting in inaccuracy. One way to tell whether an antique watch has a verge escapement is to observe the second hand closely; if it moves backward a little during each cycle, the watch is a verge. This is not necessarily the case in clocks, as there are some other pendulum escapements which exhibit recoil. * In pendulum clocks, the wide pendulum swing angles of 80¬∞-100¬∞ required by the verge cause an additional lack of isochronism due to circular error. * The wide pendulum swings also cause a lot of air friction, reducing the accuracy of the pendulum, and requiring a lot of power to keep it going, increasing wear. So verge pendulum clocks had lighter bobs, which reduced accuracy. * Verge timepieces tend to accelerate as the crown wheel and the pallets wear down. This is particularly evident in verge watches from the mid-18th century onward. It is not in the least unusual for these watches, when run today, to gain many hours per day, or to simply spin as if there were no balance present. The reason for this is that as new escapements were invented, it became the fashion to have a thin watch. To achieve this in a verge watch requires the crown wheel to be made very small, magnifying the effects of wear. Modern reproduction of an early verge and foliot clock. The pointed- tooth verge wheel is visible, with the wooden foliot rod and suspended weight above it. Decline Verge escapements were used in virtually all clocks and watches for 400 years. Then the increase in accuracy due to the introduction of the pendulum and balance spring in the mid 17th century focused attention on error caused by the escapement. By the 1820s, the verge was superseded by better escapements, though many examples of mid 19th century verge watches exist, as they were much cheaper by this time. In pocketwatches, besides its inaccuracy, the vertical orientation of the crown wheel and the need for a bulky fusee made the verge movement unfashionably thick. French watchmakers adopted the thinner cylinder escapement, invented in 1695. In England, high end watches went to the duplex escapement, developed in 1782, but inexpensive verge fusee watches continued to be produced until the mid 19th century, when the lever escapement took over. Perez 2001 , pp.8Second Time Around 2007 These later verge watches were colloquially called 'turnips' because of their bulky build. The verge was only used briefly in pendulum clocks before it was replaced by the anchor escapement, invented around 1660 and widely used beginning in 1680. The problem with the verge was that it required the pendulum to swing in a wide arc of 80¬∞ to 100¬∞. Christiaan Huygens in 1674 showed that a pendulum swinging in a wide arc is an inaccurate timekeeper, because its period of swing is sensitive to small changes in the drive force provided by the clock mechanism. Although the verge is not known for accuracy, it is capable of it. The first successful marine chronometers, H4 and H5, made by John Harrison in 1759 and 1770, used verge escapements with diamond pallets., Perez 2001 , pp.11Hird, Jonathan R., Betts, Jonathan D. & Pratt, D. The Diamond Pallets of John Harrison's Longitude Timekeeper‚ÄìH4. Annals of Science, volume 65, Issue 2, April 2008, pg 171-200 In trials they were accurate to within a fifth of a second per day. Today the verge is seen only in antique or antique-replica timepieces. Many original bracket clocks have their Victorian-era anchor escapement conversions undone and the original style of verge escapement restored. Clockmakers call this a verge reconversion.

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) list the Computing Services Computer Centre of University College Dublin as its sponsoring organisation for the .ie domain. Since 2000 the business of administrating the domain registry has been handled by IE Domain Registry Limited. Domain name registration is open to individuals located in, or with a significant connection with, any part of the island of Ireland. In 2006, .irish was a proposed new generic top-level domain (gTLD) for the global Irish community. History .ie was registered on 27 January 1988 and a year later the registration of .ie domain names was delegated by Jon Postel to the Computing Services Computer Centre of University College Dublin, then headed by Dennis Jennings. In 2000, the administration of the .ie domain was sub- delegated by UCD to a new company, IE Domain Registry Limited. The Computing Services Computer Centre of University College Dublin remains the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority's sponsoring organisation for the .ie domain. State regulation In 2000, the Irish parliament enacted a law giving the Minister for Public Enterprise the power to make regulations regarding the registration of .ie domain names. In 2007 this power was transferred to the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). Registration policy The IEDR is considered more conservative than other similar authorities and places certain restrictions on registration. The .ie ccTLD is primarily a business orientated ccTLD for Irish businesses and businesses doing business in or with Ireland. It has allowed personal domain name (PDN) registrations though these would only account for approximately 1% of the number of .ie domain registrations. An individual is allowed to register their own name or a variant of it with a utilities bill or passport as proof of entitlement. Registration policies have been liberalised somewhat in recent years and rules such as the one against registering generic domain names have been dropped. The .ie ccTLD is a managed ccTLD where applicants for .ie domain names have to provide proof of entitlement to the domain that they want to register. In August 2017 IEDR began a consultation on removing this restriction and allowing first-come first-served registration; the requirement of a connection to Ireland will remain. Registration is restricted to entities with a connection to Ireland. Thus, American singer Melanie was not allowed to register \`Melan.ie\`; whereas Microsoft, which has a corporate presence in Ireland, was allowed to register \`Modern.IE\`, a domain hack whose full name reflects its purpose as support for IE (Internet Explorer). In February 2016 IEDR began a consultation on the introduction of internationalized domain names, in particular the vowel + \\"fada\\" characters (√° √© √≠ √≥ √∫) used in Irish orthography. Existing holders of Irish-language domain names lacking fadas will be able to apply for the accurate name. Registering a domain The typical registration fee via accredited .ie registrars is approximately ‚Ç¨25 (plus VAT of ‚Ç¨5.75). The IEDR charges a retail price of ‚Ç¨62.00 (plus VAT of ‚Ç¨14.26) per year for direct registration and is considered a registrar of last resort for registrants who do not wish to go through the registrar network. This higher than normal registration fee means that it is not competing with its accredited registrars. Registration is free for charities registered with the Revenue Commissioners. Evidence of entitlement to the domain name (such as evidence of entitlement to use a particular business name via a Registered Business Name certificate or registered company name) and a connection with the island of Ireland are required for registration. Second-level domains There is no official second-level domain policy. A number of domain names, typically those of other TLDs, two letter domains and potentially offensive domains are forbidden from being registered. Nevertheless, the Government of Ireland began using the \`.gov.ie\` domain where once it used \`irlgov.ie\`. Some government departments continue to use their own non \`gov.ie\` domains. Prior to 16 December 2015, two character domains consisting of one letter and one number were permitted, but two-letter domain registrations were not permitted. The only exceptions to the old two letter rule were \`ul.ie\`, which was registered by the University of Limerick before the rule came into effect, and \`ns.ie\`, which is used for the .ie name servers. The domains in the forbidden category will return a record for a WHOIS query but they are not in the .ie zone. In June 2015, the IEDR announced that two-letter names would soon be available; a 30-day registration began in November for a go-live date of 16 December 2015. Where there were multiple applicants for a given combination, an auction was be held in early 2016. Number of registered domains On 31 December 2019, there were 280,958 registered .ie domain names. This has surpassed the number of Irish-owned and or hosted .com domain names. It is the preferred extension for new Irish businesses. Approximately 140 new .ie domains are registered each working day.

See, for example, , which uses both terms interchangeably (later Wicker Goods railway station) was the first railway station to be built in Sheffield, England. It was to the north of the city centre, at the northern end of the Wicker, in the fork formed by Spital Hill and Savile Street. It was opened on 31 October 1838 as the southern terminus of the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway, which ran north to Rotherham Westgate railway station. In 1840 the line was connected to the North Midland Railway at Rotherham Masborough railway station. Carriages from Sheffield would be attached to North Midland trains for onward travel. A southbound curve was added 1869. On 1 January 1847 a half-mile connecting line from the Wicker to the Bridgehouses station of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway had been constructed in order to increase goods traffic and enable wagon transfers. This short steeply graded line, enclosed within a tunnel for almost its entire length was known locally as the Fiery Jack. Wicker was replaced as a passenger station by Sheffield Midland Station on 1 February 1870 when the Midland Railway opened a new direct route from Chesterfield to just north of Wicker, now part of the Midland Main Line. Railway workers refer to this route as the \\"New Road\\", as opposed to the \\"Old Road\\" of the original North Midland line. It has gradients of 1 in 100, a viaduct and three tunnels, including Bradway Tunnel, long. Wicker remained open as a goods station until 1965 and has now been demolished. The site is currently occupied by a Tesco Extra supermarket, having previously contained car dealerships and was, until 2006 when the Spital Hill / Savile Street corner was remodelled as part of the Sheffield Northern Relief Road, the home of Amanda King's Made In Sheffield sculpture, now removed.

a collaboration between former members of the Gay Liberation Front and members of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE). At the newspaper's height, circulation was 18,000 to 19,000 copies. History of Gay News The original editorial collective included Denis Lemon (editor), Martin Corbett (who later was an active member of ACT UP), David Seligman, a founder member of the London Gay Switchboard collective, Ian Dunn of the Scottish Minorities Group, Glenys Parry (national chair of CHE), Suki J. Pitcher, and Doug Pollard, who later went on to launch the weekly gay newspaper, Gay Week (affectionately known as Gweek) (he later became a presenter on Joy Melbourne 94.9FM, Australia's first full-time GLBTI radio station, and was for a time editor of Melbourne Star, the city's fortnightly gay newspaper). Amongst Gay News's early \\"Special Friends\\" were Graham Chapman of Monty Python's Flying Circus, his partner David Sherlock, and Antony Grey, secretary of the UK Homosexual Law Reform Society from 1962 to 1970. Sex between men had been partially decriminalised for males over the age of 21 in England and Wales with the passage of the Sexual Offences Act 1967. After the Stonewall Riots in New York in 1969, the Gay Liberation Front spread from the United States to London in 1970. Gay News was the response to a nationwide demand by lesbians and gay men for news of the burgeoning liberation movement. The paper played a pivotal role in the struggle for gay rights in the 1970s in the UK. It was described by Alison Hennegan (who joined the newspaper as Assistant Features Editor and Literary Editor in June 1977) as the movement's \\"debating chamber\\". Although essentially a newspaper, reporting alike on discrimination and political and social advances, it also campaigned for further law reform, including parity with the heterosexual age of consent of sixteen, against the hostility of the church which treated homosexuality as a sin, and the medical profession which treated homosexuality as a pathology. It campaigned for equal rights in employment (notably in the controversial area of the teaching profession) and the trades union movement at a time when left politics in the United Kingdom was still historically influenced by its Nonconformist roots in its hostility to homosexuality. But under the influence of its features editors, Howes and Hennegan, it also excavated the lesbian and cultural history of past decades as well as presenting new developments in the arts. Keith Howes later published the encyclopaedic reference, Broadcasting It, ostensibly dealing with homosexuality in film, radio and TV from 1923 to 1993 but amounting to a cultural review of British homosexuality in the 20th century. Two of the paper's news staff, Michael Mason and Graham McKerrow, later founded the London weekly newspaper Capital Gay which was launched in June 1981. Gay News challenged the authorities from the outset by publishing personal contact ads, in defiance of the law ‚Äî in early editions this section was always headlined \\"Love knoweth no laws.\\" In the first year of publication, editor Denis Lemon was charged and fined for obstruction, for taking photographs of police behaviour outside the popular leather bar in Earls Court, the Coleherne pub. In September 1973 Gay News, in conjunction with the Gay Liberation Front, recognised that they were receiving a large volume of information calls to their offices. Accordingly, they put out a call for a switchboard to be organised. Six months later, on 4 March 1974, the London Gay Switchboard (now Switchboard - LGBT+ Helpline) was formed. Gay News alongside Switchboard and the Health Education Council went on to hold the first open conference on HIV/AIDS in Britain on 21 May 1983.Switchboard LGBT+ Helpline Archive, Open Conference on AIDS, London, Bishopsgate Institute, SB/10/1/3 At this conference Mel Rosen, of Gay Men's Health Crisis, New York, declared \\"I hope you get very scared today because there is a locomotive coming down the tracks and it‚Äôs leaving the United States.\\" In 1974, Gay News was charged with obscenity, having published an issue with a cover photograph of two men kissing. It won the court case. The newspaper was featured in the 1975 movie Tommy. In 1976 Mary Whitehouse brought a private prosecution of blasphemy (Whitehouse v Lemon) against both the newspaper and its editor, Denis Lemon, over the publication of James Kirkup's poem The Love that Dares to Speak its Name in the issue dated 3 June 1976. Lemon was found guilty when the case came to court in July 1977 and sentenced to a suspended nine-month prison sentence and personally fined ¬£1,000. When all totalled up, fines and court costs awarded against Lemon and Gay News amounted to nearly ¬£10,000. After a campaign and several appeals the suspended prison sentence was dropped, but the conviction remained in force. The case drew enormous media coverage at the time. In 2002 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a play about the trial. Gay News Ltd ceased trading on 15 April 1983. Campaign against W.H. Smith One of the biggest problems the newspaper faced was that, although it was not an obscene publication, sale outlets were hard to find. W.H. Smith then controlled much of the newspaper and magazine distribution in the UK through a wholly owned subsidiary and they refused to sell it or allow their distribution company to distribute it to other suppliers. Various campaigns organised by the gay community to shame W.H. Smith into carrying the paper met with success.

The lake was formed by the glacier of the Rh√¥ne. It is 5.3 kilometres long and 1.2 kilometres wide when full, the maximum depth is 36 metres. The lake is shared between four municipalities and two cantons. It is the fifth largest natural lake of glacier origin in France. It is a major archaeological site, with several protected natural areas that are inaccessible by the public.  Geography  = Location = Lake Paladru is located in the Is√®re d√©partement, in the region of the Miocene hills of Bas- Dauphin√© called \\"Terres froides\\" and between the towns of Voiron and La Tour- du-Pin. It extends in a north-east or south-west orientation over 5.3 kilometres for a width of 650 metres. The average depth is 25 metres, with a maximum depth of 36 metres. The lake contains 97 million m¬≥ of water, and is located 492 metres above sea level. Four municipalities share the lake; Charavines to the south, Villages du Lac de Paladru (merge of Le Pin and Paladru in 2017) to the west and north, Montferrat and Bilieu to the east. The main beaches are located at the northern and southern ends, the shores on the side have a steeper gradient. = Access = The lake is bordered by two departmental roads which allow access: * The route d√©partementale 50 (D50) which connects the town of La B√¢tie-Divisin (at a junction with the D1075) to the town of La Murette (at a junction with the D520) * The route d√©partementale 90 (D90) which connects the town of Charavines with Villages du Lac de Paladru along the eastern shore. The lake is located about 5 kilometres from the A48 autoroute, which connects the A43 to Grenoble. The lake can be accessed from either junction 9 for Rives, or junction 10 for Voiron. = Hydrography =  Water source  The lake is fed by two streams which are two tributaries of La Fure: * the Courbon, a 3.7 kilometre long stream which originates at Montferrat and joins the lake at Paladru. * the Surand, also known as Chantabot or Marais stream. This is an outlet from the Vivier pond, a body of water located in the municipality of Valencogne.  The source of La Fure  La Fure enters the lake at Charavines. This river joins the Is√®re at Tullins, after 20 kilometres having crossed Rives. = Weather = The lake area has a cool temperate climate. The north-south orientation and relatively high altitude means the average temperature is around 10¬∞C. Rainfall is irregular, with most rain occurring in June and October with the rise of humid air masses from the Mediterranean. January is the coldest month, with freezing occurring frequently.  Toponymy  There are two possibilities to explain the origin of the name: * the word palud (sometimes written palue) means \\"marais\\" (marsh in English) in ancient French. The term Paladru, attached to the village of the same name, is similar to this term. A marsh is located north of the lake. * According to Dauphinois historian Nicolas Chorier, the term Paladru could refer to the presence of oaks (\\"Œ¥œÅœçœÇ\\" dr√∫s in Greek).  History  Between 1909 and 1913, the lake served as an experimental ground for prototype seaplanes built by Raymond de Montgolfier.

Facts  James Kirkup's poem The Love that Dares to Speak its Name was published in the 3 June 1976 issue of Gay News. The poem, written from the viewpoint of a Roman centurion, graphically describes him having sex with Jesus after his crucifixion, and also claims that Jesus had had sex with numerous disciples, guards, and even Pontius Pilate. In early November 1976, Mary Whitehouse obtained a copy of the poem and announced her intention to bring a private prosecution against the magazine. Leave to bring this prosecution was granted on 9 December 1976. The charges named Gay News Ltd and Denis Lemon1945 ‚Äì 1994 as the publishers. A charge against Moore Harness Ltd for distributing was subsequently dropped. The indictment described the offending publication as \\"a blasphemous libel concerning the Christian religion, namely an obscene poem and illustration vilifying Christ in his life and in his crucifixion\\". The Gay News Fighting Fund was set up in December 1976. Judge Alan King-Hamilton QC heard the trial at the Old Bailey on 4 July 1977, with John Mortimer QC and Geoffrey Robertson QC representing the accused and John Smyth representing Mary Whitehouse. On Monday 11 July, the jury found both defendants guilty. Gay News Ltd was fined ¬£1,000. Denis Lemon was fined ¬£500 and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment suspended. It had been \\"touch and go\\", said the judge, whether he would actually send Denis Lemon to jail. Mary Whitehouse's costs of ¬£7,763 were ordered to be paid four-fifths by Gay News Ltd and one-fifth by Lemon. Gay News Ltd and Denis Lemon appealed against conviction and sentence. On 17 March 1978, the Court of Appeal quashed Denis Lemon's suspended prison sentence but upheld the convictions on the basis that the law of blasphemy had been developed before mens rea, literally, a \\"guilty mind\\", became an essential element of a crime. Gay News readers voted by a majority of 20 to 1 in favour of appealing to the House of Lords. The Law Lords heard the appeal against conviction and delivered their judgment on 21 February 1979. At issue was whether or not the offence of blasphemous libel required specific intent of committing such a blasphemy. By a majority of 3 to 2, the Lords concluded that intention was not required. Lord Scarman was of the opinion that blasphemy laws should cover all religions and not just Christianity and sought strict liability for those who \\"cause grave offence to the religious feelings of some of their fellow citizens or are such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely to read them\\".R v Lemon [1979] AC 617, 664 The appeal was lost. Judgement The European Commission of Human Rights declared the case inadmissible to be heard by the European Court of Human Rights on 7 May 1982. The ¬£26,435 raised by the Gay News Fighting Fund through benefits and donations from the gay community and others, including a ¬£500 donation from Monty Python, was sufficient to cover the costs of the trial and appeals. Abolition of blasphemous libel as an offence Blasphemous libel ceased to be a common law offence in England and Wales with the passing of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008.

Randall, 357 U.S. 513 (1958), was a U.S. Supreme Court case addressing the State of California's refusal to grant to ACLU lawyer Lawrence Speiser, a veteran of World War II, a tax exemption because that person refused to sign a loyalty oath as required by a California law enacted in 1954. The court reversed a lower court ruling that the loyalty oath provision did not violate the appellants' First Amendment rights. Facts The State of California allowed a number of tax exemptions one of which was an exemption of property tax for veterans of World War II. Anyone desiring to claim the exemption was required to complete a standard form of application and submit the form with the local tax assessor. In 1954, the form was revised to add a loyalty oath, which the applicant had to sign: \\"I do not advocate the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State of California by force or violence or other unlawful means, nor advocate the support of a foreign government against the United States in event of hostilities.\\" The appellants refused to sign the oath and contended the condition of requiring the oath to obtain a tax exemption was unconstitutional. The assessors denied the exemption solely because the appellants had refused to execute the oath by signature. The assessors based their reasoning on Article XX, 19, of the California Constitution, adopted in a general election in 1952, which includes language similar to the text of the loyalty oath. Issue Was the oath requirement a violation of the appellants' First Amendment rights and a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? Lower courts The appellees argued that a tax exemption is a privilege and so its denial did not infringe on free speech. The lower California courts did not agree and recognize that conditions imposed on privileges provided by the state had to be reasonable. However, the Supreme Court of California construed the constitutional amendment to deny the tax exemption only to claimants who may be criminally punished under the California Criminal Syndicalism Act (California Statute 1919, c. 188) or the Federal Smith Act (18 U.S.C. 2385). Decision The US Supreme Court in its review asked a more basic question: with the loyalty oath, has California chosen a fair method to determine whether a tax exemption claimant is in fact someone to whom the criminal acts specified applies. In other words, though it is reasonable to deny a claimant a tax exemption if the claimant is involved in a criminal behavior, has the state arrived at a mechanism that demonstrates the criminal behavior? The court ruled that because the state requires the claimant to show they are not advocating state overthrow and hence are not criminals within the applicable laws, the loyalty oath requirement to obtain the tax exemption is unconstitutional. The burden of proof for a criminal action rests on the state and not on the individual private citizen. In other cases, the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of loyalty oaths requirements but those involved public officials and not private citizens.

Biography and work Crosby was born in Norwich, Connecticut, the only child of Harry Clifton Crosby and Rose Glasbrenner. After serving as a pilot with the U.S. military,Transformations : The Story of the Science Fiction Magazines from 1950 to 1970, Liverpool University Press, 2005, page 286. he began publishing science fiction with the story \\"Cinderella, Inc.\\" in the December 1952 issue of the magazine Imagination. By 1956, he had adopted his pseudonym Christopher Anvil and his science fiction work was being published in Astounding Magazine. He went on to a long and successful career in the field. His stories usually deal with characters in different human government organizations, dealing with adventures, gadgetry and subterfuge both internal and external. His military background enabled him to bring a certain realism to his portrayal of action and intrigue, which counterpointed the more fantastical elements of his stories. One of Anvil's best-known short stories is \\"Pandora's Planet\\", which appeared first in Astounding Magazine in September 1956 and has since been reprinted several times, including an appearance in the first volume of Anvil's works published in hardcover by Baen's Books, Pandora's Legions. It has also been \\"fixed-up\\" into a full-length novel. Anvil's repeated appearances in Astounding/Analog in the 1950s and 60 were due in part to three factors. Firstly his ability to write stories which fitted with one of Campbell's preferred approaches to plotting: alien opponents with superior firepower losing out to the superior intelligence or indomitable will of humans. Secondly, his stories are nearly always humorous throughout, and the humour is well done. Finally there was his characterization and manner of story crafting, where his protagonists slid from disaster to disaster with the best of intentions, and through exercise of fast thinking, managed to snatch victory somehow from the jaws of defeat. His stories became a perennial favorite with readers and then in 1966... \\"he hit a winning streak in the late 1960s in a series which seemed straight out of Star Trek ... The Interstellar Patrol\\".Transformations : The Story of the Science Fiction Magazines from 1950 to 1970, Liverpool University Press, 2005, page 286. The bulk of Anvil's published writing consists of short stories, but these can be read in sequence according to the in-world timeline, as is now arranged in the two collections of The Interstellar Patrol. Many of his non- series stories are almost purely idea-driven science fiction. Some of the most striking of these, for example \\"Gadget vs. Trend\\", entirely lack dialogue and almost entirely lack characters; these stories consist of a series of newspaper reports or other similar materials. In these and other stories, Anvil's technique is to put forth a gadget, invention, or social trend and logically develop the consequences. Modern reprints Like the work of many 20th century science fiction writers, all of Anvil's work has recently become available again by print-on-demand and ebooks. According to David Weber, who acknowledges being influenced by Anvil in the introduction to the anthology Interstellar Patrol: Anvil also published a number of stories taking place within the Federation of Humanity (The term originates in the sub-title of the third anthology title released by Baen: Interstellar Patrol II, \\"The Federation of Humanity\\"Baen Books by Anvil , retrieved: 11-30-2007). Anvil himself, as well as John Campbell, referred to these stories as the Colonization Series prior to their being released as collections.

Life and career He was the son of two painters, Sir William Beechey, RA and his second wife, Anne Jessop.John Wilson, 'Beechey, Sir William (1753‚Äì1839)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 accessed 2 May 2017 Born in London on 17 February 1796, he entered the Royal Navy at the age of 10. He was promoted to midshipman the following year and saw active service during the wars with France and America. In early 1818, and now a lieutenant, Beechey sailed on HMS Trent under Lieutenant John Franklin in David Buchan's Arctic expedition, of which at a later period he published a narrative. In the following year he accompanied Lieutenant W. E. Parry in , sailing as far north as Melville Island. In 1821, as an officer on HMS Adventure, he took part in the survey of the Mediterranean coast of Africa under the direction of Captain William Henry Smyth. His brother, Henry William Beechey, and he made an overland survey of this coast and published a full account of their work in 1828 under the title of Proceedings of the Expedition to Explore the Northern Coast of Africa from Tripoly Eastward in 1821-1822. The Botany of Captain Beechey's Voyage, 1841 In 1825, Beechey was appointed to command . His task was to explore the Bering Strait in concert with Franklin and Parry operating from the east. In the summer of 1826, he passed the strait and a barge from his ship reached 71¬∞23'31\\" N., and 156¬∞21'30\\" W. near Point Barrow, which he named, a point only 146 miles west of that reached by Franklin's expedition from the Mackenzie River. The whole voyage lasted more than three years, and in the course of it, Beechey discovered several islands in the Pacific, and an excellent harbour near Cape Prince of Wales. In 1826, he visited a Catholic mission in California. He wrote, \\"...with whips, canes and goads or sharp, pointed sticks to preserve silence and maintain order, and what seemed more difficult than either, to keep the congregation in their kneeling posture. The goads would reach a long way and inflict a sharp puncture without making any noise. The end of the church was occupied by a guard of soldiers under arms with fixed bayonets.\\" In July 1826, he named the three islands in the Bering Strait. Two were the Diomede Islands that Vitus Bering had named in 1728: \\"Ratmanoff Island\\" (Big Diomede) and \\"Krusenstern Island\\" (Little Diomede). Beechey called the uninhabited third islet \\"Fairway Rock\\", which is still its contemporary name. One of his crew, Petty Officer John Bechervaise, gave a detailed account of the voyage in his Thirty-six Years of a Seafaring Life by an Old Quartermaster, published privately in 1839. (The crewmember's namesake and great-great-grandson John B√©chervaise (1910‚Äì1998) was a noted explorer of Antarctica.) In 1831, there appeared Beechey's Narrative of a Voyage to the Pacific and Bering's Strait to Co- operate with the Polar Expeditions, 1825-1828. Beechey Tidal Chart of the Irish Channel dated 1846 In 1835 and '36, Captain Beechey was employed on the coast survey of South America, and from 1837 to 1847, carried on similar work along the Irish coasts, and in the North Sea and English Channel. He carried out detailed tidal surveys during this period, which were published, with charts, in two Royal Society papers in 1848 and 1851. This was the first published work of its kind since Edmond Halley's tidal chart appeared in about 1702. He was appointed in 1850 to preside over the Marine Department of the Board of Trade. In 1854, he was made rear admiral, and in the following year was elected president of the Royal Geographical Society. Beechey Island, where Sir John Franklin wintered, was named by him after his father. Family of painters His daughter was painter Frances Anne Hopkins, who lived in Canada for 12 years and painted many scenes of canoe travel. His parents and three of his brothers were painters: admiral and painter Richard Brydges Beechey, portraitist Henry William Beechey, and portraitist George Duncan Beechey.

The rugged, dark-haired Breck played the gambler and gunfighter Doc Holliday on the ABC/Warner Bros. Television series Maverick as well as Victoria Barkley's (Barbara Stanwyck) hot-tempered, middle son Nick in the 1960s ABC/Four Star Western, The Big Valley. Breck also had the starring role in an earlier NBC/Four Star Western television series entitled Black Saddle. Early years Joseph Peter Breck was born in Rochester, New York. He grew up living with his grandparents in Haverhill, Massachusetts, because they felt they could provide a more stable home environment than his father, who often traveled as a jazz musician. He attended the University of Houston, where he studied English and drama. Family Breck was the son of bandleader Joe Breck, who was nicknamed \\"The Prince of Pep\\", and whose band once included trombone player Jerry Colonna. His parents divorced when Peter was eight. Peter went with Joe, while his younger brother George accompanied their mother, resulting in a decades-long separation. In 1959 an Associated Press photograph showed the brothers reunited after being out of touch for 22 years. The caption explained: \\"George told newsmen he saw Peter on television and recognized a resemblance. He went to the actor's studio and the relationship was confirmed.\\" Career =Early career= After post-World War II United States Navy service in the 1940s on the aircraft carrier , Breck played professional basketball for the Rochester Royals during the 1948-49 season. He then worked as a ranch hand while studying drama at the University of Houston, and went on to make his on-screen debut in a 1958 film that was eventually released under the title The Beatniks. As well as performing in live theatre, Breck had several guest-starring roles on a number of popular series, such as Sea Hunt, several episodes of Wagon Train, Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel, Perry Mason and Gunsmoke. In 1956, he and David Janssen appeared in John Bromfield's syndicated series Sheriff of Cochise in the episode entitled \\"The Turkey Farmers\\". He appeared in another syndicated series too in the episode \\"The Deserter\\" of the American Civil War drama Gray Ghost, with Tod Andrews in the title role. When Robert Mitchum saw Breck in George Bernard Shaw's play The Man of Destiny in Washington, D.C., he offered Breck a role as a rival driver in Thunder Road (1958). Mitchum helped Breck to relocate to Los Angeles, California. As Breck then did not have his own car, Mitchum lent him his Jaguar.http://www.peterbreck.ca/introduction.htm Mitchum introduced Breck to Dick Powell who contracted him to Four Star Productions where Breck appeared in the CBS western anthology series, Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater. Breck appeared with fellow guest star Diane Brewster in the 1958 episode \\"The Lady Gambler\\" of the ABC western series, Tombstone Territory, starring Pat Conway and Richard Eastham. That same year, Breck appeared in an episode of the syndicated Highway Patrol, starring Broderick Crawford. He was also cast in an episode of NBC's The Restless Gun, starring John Payne. He appeared in a 1958 episode of \\"Gunsmoke\\" playing the role of murder suspect, Hoyt Fly, a cowboy working a Texas cattle drive. That same year, Breck played the role of bad guy in an episode of Wagon Train, \\"The Story of Tobias Jones\\", opposite Lou Costello. From January 1959 to May 1960 Breck starred as Clay Culhane, the gunfighter-turned-lawyer in the ABC western Black Saddle, with secondary roles for Russell Johnson, Anna-Lisa, J. Pat O'Malley and Walter Burke. Unlike in The Big Valley, in which Breck played an easily angered rancher, he is low- key, restrained and considerate as the lawyer Culhane. Breck was later a contract star with Warner Bros. Television, where he appeared as Doc Holliday on Maverick, a part that had been played twice earlier in the series by Gerald Mohr and by Adam West on ABC's Lawman. Breck appeared in several other ABC/WB series of the time, such as Cheyenne, 77 Sunset Strip, The Roaring Twenties (as trumpet player Joe Peabody in the episode \\"Big Town Blues\\"), and The Gallant Men. He was cast as a young Theodore Roosevelt in the 1961 episode \\"The Yankee Tornado\\" of the ABC/WB Western series, Bronco, starring Ty Hardin. \\"The Yankee Tornado\\" features Will Hutchins of the ABC/WB Western series Sugarfoot in a crossover appearance. Breck's first starring role in a film was Lad, A Dog (1962). The next year, he played the leading roles in both Samuel Fuller's Shock Corridor and the science fiction horror film The Crawling Hand. He also costarred in the cavalry movie, The Glory Guys. Between 1963 and 1965 Breck made three guest appearances on Perry Mason, including the roles of defendant William Sherwood in the 1964 episode, \\"The Case of the Antic Angel\\", and defendant Peter Warren in the 1965 episode, \\"The Case of the Gambling Lady\\". During this time, he appeared on episodes of such television series as Mr. Novak, The Outer Limits, Bonanza and The Virginian.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0741024/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0740968/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 Breck claimed to have been considered for leads on two successful television series produced by Quinn Martin The Fugitive (1963) and 12 O'Clock High (1964) with Breck commenting that \\"If you are a leading man in Hollywood you either draw $250,000 like Steve McQueen or you had better be in a series\\".Crosby, Joan. \\"Warner Bros Can't Afford Peter Breck\\", Ocala Star Banner (pg. 12), July 26, 1965. =The Big Valley= The Big Valley cast with Breck at far right From 1965 to 1969, Breck starred on The Big Valley as Nick Barkley, foreman of the Barkley ranch and son to Barbara Stanwyck's character, Victoria Barkley. The second of four children, Nick was hotheaded, short-tempered, and very fast with a gun. Always spoiling for a fight and frequently wearing leather gloves, Breck's character took the slightest offense to the Barkley name personally and quickly made his displeasure known, as often with his fists as with his vociferous shouts. Often this proved to be a mistake and only through the calming influence of his mother and cooler-headed siblings, Jarrod (Richard Long), half-brother Heath (Lee Majors), sister Audra (Linda Evans) and Eugene (Charles Briles; written out after season 1 when he was drafted into the Army), would a difficult situation be rectified. Having been a Barbara Stanwyck admirer since the 1940s, when he was a teenager, Breck developed an on- and off-screen chemistry with her, practicing longer lines and even being a ranch foreman on the set. After the series was canceled, he stayed close to her until her death. =After The Big Valley= In 1970 he appeared as Lafe Harkness on the TV western \\"The Men From Shiloh\\" (rebranded name for The Virginian) in the episode titled \\"Hannah.\\" Most of his roles in the 1970s and 1980s were television guest-starring performances on such series as Alias Smith and Jones, Mission: Impossible, McMillan & Wife, S.W.A.T., The Six Million Dollar Man (again with Lee Majors), The Incredible Hulk and The Dukes of Hazzard, as well as roles as himself on Fantasy Island, and The Fall Guy which also starred former television \\"brother\\" Lee Majors. In the mid-1980s, Breck moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with his wife Diane and their son, Christopher. He was asked by a casting director to teach a weekly class to young actors on film technique. That once-a-week class became a full- time acting school - The Breck Academy - which he operated for 10 years. In 1990, Breck appeared in the Canadian cult film Terminal City Ricochet. On January 20, 1990, while teaching at the drama school, Breck was notified of Barbara Stanwyck's death. She requested no funeral nor memorial. In 1991, he appeared as Sham-Ir, the chief of all genies, in the NBC-TV movie special I Still Dream of Jeannie, the second reunion film which reunited I Dream of Jeannie TV series co-stars Barbara Eden and Bill Daily, along with Al Waxman and Ken Kercheval. In the movie The Unnamable II: The Statement of Randolph Carter (1993), Breck played Sheriff Hatch. In 1996, he appeared in an episode of the new version of The Outer Limits. Breck provided the voice of Farmer Brown in \\"Critters\\", a 1998 episode of The New Batman Adventures. His last television performance was on an episode of John Doe in 2002. Prior to his death, most of his film performances have been in undistributed films that are shown only at film festivals. Personal life Breck married dancer Diane Bourne in 1960.Breck's obituary in The New York Times incorrectly gave his wife's name as Diana rather than Diane. They had a son, Christopher, who died of leukemia. Death In June 2010 Breck's wife Diane announced on his website that the actor had been suffering from dementia and could no longer sign autographs for fans, although she said that he still read and enjoyed their letters. Despite this diagnosis, she said he was still physically healthy and did not require medication. Thereafter, Diane Breck reported that her husband was hospitalised on January 10, 2012. On February 6, 2012 Peter Breck died from his illness at the age of 82 in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Today, it is an offence under the common law of Northern Ireland, but has been abolished in England and Wales, and repealed in Canada and New Zealand. It consists of the publication of material which exposes the Christian religion to scurrility, vilification, ridicule, and contempt, with material that must have the tendency to shock and outrage the feelings of Christians. It is a form of criminal libel. Historically, the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were adopted from the common law of England as common law offences in British colonies and territories. From the late 19th century, several colonies and countries replaced the common law offences with adopted versions of the draft code called \\"the Stephen Code\\" written by Sir James Fitzjames Stephen as part of a Royal Commission in England in 1879. The Stephen Code included the offence of blasphemous libel but omitted blasphemy. The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were abolished in England and Wales with the passage of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008Beckford, Martin (10 May 2008). \\"Blasphemy laws are lifted\\". The Telegraph. but the offences remain as part of the common law, criminal code, or criminal statute in various countries, states, territories, and legal jurisdictions.  United Nations General Comment 34  Blasphemy laws are incompatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). In July, 2011, the UN Human Rights Committee released a 52-paragraph statement, General Comment 34 on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1976, concerning freedoms of opinion and expression. Paragraph 48 states: Defence In both Canada and New Zealand and other jurisdictions that adopted versions of the Stephen Code under their respective legislation, it was not blasphemous libel to express in good faith and decent language any opinion on a religious subject. Australia The offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel in English common-law were carried over to the Australian colonies and \\"received\\" into state law. Blasphemy and blasphemous libel are not criminal offences under Australian federal law and the common- law offences were abolished by the Australia Criminal Code Act 1995. The Australian Capital Territory abolished the common-law offence of blasphemous libel but not blasphemy with the Law Reform (Abolitions & Repeals) Act 1996. The common-law offences were abolished completely in Queensland and Western Australia when those jurisdictions adopted criminal codes that abolished the common-law offences and did not replace them with code offences. The criminal code of Tasmania includes the offences of both blasphemy and blasphemous libel and abolishes both common-law offences. In New South Wales, the crimes act recognises blasphemous libel and the common-law offences have not been abolished. In both Tasmania and New South Wales, the relevant offences are not enforced and generally regarded as obsolete. In South Australia, Victoria, and the Northern Territory, the situation is uncertain as the local criminal codes do not mention blasphemy or blasphemous libel but did not specifically abolish the common-law offences. Canada =Summary of offence and defence= Blasphemy and Blasphemous libel were common law offences before the Criminal Code Act of 1892 abolished the common law offence of Blasphemy but included the offence of Blasphemous libel. Before repeal in December 2018, blasphemous libel was an offence under section 296 of the Criminal Code of Canada. It was an indictable offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s. 296; formerly s 260 of the Criminal Code, RSC 1970, c C-34. The offence of blasphemous libel, like all other laws of Canada, was subject to section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects freedom of expression. Before the law's repeal, no court was asked to consider whether blasphemous libel was consistent with the Charter's guarantee of freedom of expression, which came into force in 1982. =Last prosecution: R v Rahard (1935)= The last prosecution of a charge of blasphemous libel was in 1935, in R v Rahard, in Quebec.R v Rahard, [1936] 3 D.L.R. 230 (Court of Sessions of the Peace, Quebec, 1935). In that case, the court adopted an argument that prosecutor E. J. Murphy had proffered in the case of R v Sperry (unreported) in 1926. Mr. Murphy put the issue this way: In Rahard, the Court found the Rev. Victor Rahard of the Anglican Church of Canada guilty of blasphemous libel for his aspersions upon the Roman Catholic Church.The information on blasphemous libel in Canada comes from Tremeear's Annotated Criminal Code (published annually). The words \\"calculated and intended to insult the feelings and the deepest religious convictions of the great majority of the persons amongst whom we live\\", which the court used, were adopted from the summing up of Lord Coleridge, LCJ. in R v Bradlaugh.R v Bradlaugh (1883), 15 Cox CC 217 at 230.

The bill passed the House of Commons on 11 December 2017. The Senate passed the bill with amendments on 30 October 2018.

R. Birley, ‚ÄòRoman officers and their wives at Vindolanda (act. AD 97‚Äì105)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, May 2008; online edn, May 2010 accessed 8 Aug 2017 was a literate Roman woman, the wife of Aelius Brocchus, commander of an unidentified fort near Vindolanda fort in northern England.Alan Bowman and David Thomas, Vindolanda: the Latin writing tablets, London: Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, 1983, pp. 256 She is known for a birthday invitation she sent around 100 AD to Sulpicia Lepidina, wife of Flavius Cerialis, commander at Vindolanda. This invitation, written in ink on a thin wooden tablet, was discovered in the 1970s and is probably the best-known item of the Vindolanda Tablets. The first part of the letter was written in formal style in a professional hand evidently by a scribe; the last four lines are added in a different handwriting, thought to be Claudia's own. The translation is as follows: :Claudia Severa to her Lepidina greetings. :On 11 September, sister, for the day of the celebration of my birthday, I give you a warm invitation to make sure that you come to us, to make the day more enjoyable for me by your arrival, if you are present. Give my greetings to your Cerialis. My Aelius and my little son send him their greetings. :(2nd hand) I shall expect you, sister. Farewell, sister, my dearest soul, as I hope to prosper, and hail. :(Back, 1st hand) To Sulpicia Lepidina, (wife) of Cerialis, from Cl. Severa.\\" The Latin reads as follows: :Cl. Sever√° Lepidinae [suae] [sa]l[u]tem iii Idus Septembres soror ad diem sollemnem natalem meum rog√≥ libenter faci√°s ut venias ad nos iucundiorem mihi :[diem] intervent√∫ tuo factur√° si aderis Cerial[em t]uum salut√° Aelius meus [...] et filiolus salutant :sperabo te soror vale soror anima mea ita valeam karissima et have The Vindolanda Tablets also contain a fragment from another letter in Claudia's hand. These two letters are thought to be the oldest extant writing by a woman in Latin found in Britain, or perhaps anywhere. The letters show that correspondence between the two women was frequent and routine, and that they were in the habit of visiting one another, although it is not known at which fort Severa lived. Remains of stone forts at Vindolanda There are several aspects of Severa's letters that should be regarded as literary, even though they were not written for a wide readership. In particular, they share several thematic and stylistic features with other surviving writings in Latin by women from Greek and Roman antiquity. Although Severa's name reveals that she is unlikely to be related to Sulpicia Lepidina, she refers frequently to Lepidina as her sister, and uses the word iucundus to evoke a strong and sensual sense of the pleasure Lepidina's presence would bring, creating a sense of affection through her choice of language. In the post-script written in her own hand, she appears to draw on another Latin, literary model, from the fourth book of the Aeneid, in which at 4.8 Vergil characterises Anna as Dido's unanimam sororem, \\"sister sharing a soul\\", and at 4.31, she is \\"cherished more than life\\" (luce magis dilecta sorori). Although this is not proof that Severa and Lepidina were familiar with Virgil's writing, another letter in the archive, written between two men, directly quotes a line from the Aeneid, suggesting that the sentiments and language Sulpicia used do indeed draw on a Virgilian influence. The Latin word that was chosen to describe the birthday festivities, sollemnis, is also noteworthy, as it means \\"ceremonial, solemn, performed in accordance with the forms of religion\\", and suggests that Severa has invited Lepidina to what was an important annual religious occasion. Display of letter The invitation was acquired in 1986 by the British Museum, where it holds registration number 1986,1001.64. The museum has a selection of the Vindolanda Tablets on display, and loans some to the museum at Vindolanda.

It was larger, heavier, and more angular in its styling than its predecessor, the T2. The T3 was manufactured in Germany from 1979 until 1991. Production of the Syncro (mostly for official use, like postal service or German army) continued until 1992 at Puch in Graz/Austria, where all 4WDs were built. It was available in 14\\" syncro and a 16\\" syncro version, main difrences between the 2 models was 16\\" wheels with 205R16 tires, lager front brakes 280mm dics insted of 254mm disc that was on the 14\\" syncro but they shared the same calipers and brake pads. The 16\\" syncro had larger rear brakes taken from the VW LT and fender flares which hid the area where VW trimmed the arches to give more room for larger tires. A limited number of 2WD models were also produced at the Graz factory after German production had come to an end in 1990. South African production of the T3 continued, for that market only, until 2002. The T3 was the final generation of rear-engined Volkswagens. History Following the Type 2 T2, the Type 2 T3 initially featured air-cooled engines; later models had water-cooled engines. Versions produced in South Africa from 1990 until 2002 featured an Audi five-cylinder engine. Volkswagen marketed the Westfalia camper variant throughout the T3 production, with features including a raised roof (either pop-up or fixed), refrigerator, sink, and stove. Examples built between 1979 and 1985 featured round headlights and basic steel or chrome-plated steel bumpers with plastic end-caps. Air-cooled models (1979 to mid-1983) lack the lower grill above the radiator of the water-cooled models, except on models with factory air conditioning. Production of the Syncro four-wheel drive model began in late 1984, with the world premiere taking place at the Brussels Commercial Vehicle Show in January 1985. The original Syncros came equipped with the gasoline 1.9 with and a \\"4+G\\" gearbox, with the G being a low gear for offroad use (Gel√§nde in German). 1986 model year models received revisions including a rev counter, more fabric choices, redesigned air conditioning, enlarged water-cooled engine with a more advanced engine management system, and redesigned transmissions. Exterior changes included rectangular headlights (on selected models), and different paint options. Alloy wheels, larger and squarer fiberglass bumpers with trim along the rocker panels were optional (standard on Hannover and Wolfsburg Edition vans). For 1990 and 1991 model years, a \\"Carat\\" trim level was available which included all available options except the Westfalia conversion and Syncro. Some 1979 through 1981 models received eight welded-in metal slats covering the engine ventilation passages behind the rear windows. All later models had black plastic 16-slat covers that slotted in at the top and screwed down at the bottom. During the 1980s, the U.S. Army and Air Force in Germany used T3s as administrative (non-tactical) vehicles. In military use, the vehicle's nomenclature was \\"Light Truck, Commercial\\". Porsche created a version called B32 in a limited edition. The van, based on the luxurious Carat model, was equipped with the 3.2 liter Carrera engine and was originally developed to support Porsche's testing activities in Algeria. Ten of these were built, with some sold by Porsche to special customers. Porsche themselves also used the Porsche-engined bus to transport staff rapidly. Top speed was around , although Porsche only claimed to ensure that the numbers could be replicated with nine people in the car and with the air conditioning on full. There was one more six-cylinder engine, used in the VW Oettinger WBX6. The development of the engine was originally contracted to Oettinger by Volkswagen; it was derived from the regular Wasserboxer and meant for projected use in the T3. When VW abandoned the project, Oettinger bought the rights to the design and put it on the market. As such the six-cylinder shares many parts with the four-cylinder Wasserboxer. The WBX6 was originally only available with a three-speed automatic transmission, incorporating many Audi 100 parts to accommodate the higher power and torque. Features With the internal combustion engine and transaxle mounted very low in the back, the T3 had much larger disc brakes in the front, and drums in the rear. Axle weight is very nearly equal upon both the front and back ends of the vehicle. Unlike the T2 before it, the T3 was available with amenities such as power steering, air conditioning, power door locks, electrically controlled and heated mirrors, lighted vanity mirrors, and a light above the glove box (some of which were standard equipment in later (non-commercial vehicle) models). The automatic was a standard hydraulic three-speed unit, the same 090/010 unit as used in Audis of the era. These featured a cast aluminum alloy case for the transmission section and a cast iron case for the final drive section. The 091 manual transmission was a four-speed unit, featuring a lightweight aluminum alloy case; from 1983 a 5-speed transmission was available as an option on certain models; a 5-speed was fitted as standard on Syncro four-wheel-drive models. The automatic features a 1.0 ratio top gear, while the manual features a 0.85 top gear. The oil filler tube for the engine is located behind the flip-down license plate door, as is the oil dipstick and the power steering fluid reservoir (when fitted) on Petrol models. Diesel models have the reservoir in the front right corner of the engine bay. Early models had a twist-on/off non-locking gas cap right on the outside just under and behind the passenger side door. A locking cap was standard on later models. 4 Wheel Drive (Syncro) models have the fuel tank in the rear above the transmission so the filler is on the right-side rear corner. The spare tyre lies in a tray under the very front of the van (as the engine is in the back), just below the radiator. Volkswagen T3, Club Joker, 1981, Air-cooled, one front grill Engines Because of the engine placement, a T3 has nearly equal 50/50 weight distribution fore and aft. The early air-cooled engines were somewhat expensive to produce and had some reliability problems. Volkswagen originally meant to replace them with the Golf's inline-four engine but the cost of re- engineering both car and engine made them opt for updating the flat-four instead. An overhead-cam design was mooted but rejected as a willingness to rev was considered to be of less importance than low-end flexibility and low cost. The new 1.9 L \\"Wasserboxer\\" (for a water-cooled boxer) was also originally considered for use in certain other Volkswagens such as the Gol, which still relied on the old air-cooled flat-four at that time.Kacher (May 1982), p. 33 The U.S version 1.9 liter and up water-cooled gasoline engines experienced significant and repeated problems with cylinder head surface erosion and coolant leaks. 2.1 L engines suffered the same, mostly due to not having the antifreeze changed often enough, and the use of phosphated coolant, which caused corrosion in the cooling system. Volkswagen wasserboxer engine =Petrol/gasoline= There were four general petrol engine variants between 1979 and 1991, with several sub-models. All were overhead-valve push-rod horizontally opposed four-cylinder engines. Available engine options differed between regions. Aftermarket VW specialist Oettinger also offered the WBX6, a six-cylinder version. * Air-cooled (1979‚Äì1983) (similar to the Porsche 914)  1.6 L (1584 cc) (50 bhp/37 kW) (Serial # CT) air-cooled, single Solex 34 PICT-4 carburettor (not available in the United States)  2.0 L (1970 cc) (70 bhp/51 kW) (Serial # CU or CV) air-cooled, twin Solex 34 PDSIT-2/3 carburettor or fuel injected (Bosch L-Jetronic) flat-four in the 1980 to 1983 models * Water-cooled (1983 onwards)  1.9 litre engines: * 1.9 L (1913 cc) (83 bhp) (Serial # DH) water-cooled (or \\"Wasserboxer\\") engine used for the 1983 to 1985 models, which used a fuel injection system known as \\"Digijet\\" (Digital Jet- tronic) * 1.9 L (1913 cc) (59 bhp) (Serial # DF) 8.6:1 compression ratio, 34-PICT carburetor * 1.9 L (1913 cc) (76 bhp) (Serial # DG) 8.6:1 compression ratio, 2E3 or 2E4 carburetor * 1.9 L (1913 cc) (55 bhp) (Serial # EY) 7.5:1 compression ratio, 34-PICT carburetor * 1.9 L (1913 cc) (89 bhp) (Serial # GW) 8.6:1 compression ratio, Bosch Digijet electronic fuel injection  2.1 Litre engines: * 2.1 L (2109 cc) (95 bhp) (Serial # MV) Wasserboxer, used until the end of Vanagon importation into the US in 1991.

The Wasserboxer featured an aluminum case, cylinder heads, and pistons, and a forged steel crankshaft. The Wasserboxer, as with all VW boxer engines has a gear-driven camshaft. It also featured Heron, or \\"bowl-in- piston\\" type combustion chambers where the combustion takes place within the piston bowl area, and not just in the cylinder head as would be the case with flat top pistons. The switch to water-cooled boxer engines was made mid-year in 1983. T2 transporters or 'bay window' vans, produced in Brazil until 2013, were switched to inline-four-cylinder water-cooled engines and a front-mounted radiator in 2005.

U.S. model variations 1988 California-spec VW Vanagon Wolfsburg Edition 1991 US Vanagon Multivan Interior In the U.S., the T3 was sold as the Vanagon, which is a portmanteau of van and station wagon. The name Vanagon was coined by Volkswagen to highlight their claim that the T3 had the room of a van, but drove like a station wagon. U.S. Vanagon model variations included the Vanagon, featuring vinyl seats and a spartan interior; the Vanagon L with optional cloth seats, more upscale interior panels, and an optional dashboard blower; the Vanagon GL with more equipment like a padded steering wheel and front armrests; and the Westfalia pop-top camper Vanagons, which came in two versions. A Camper version known as the \\"Campmobile\\" with integrated kitchen, complete with refrigerator (which ran on propane, 110 V or 12 V), a two-burner stove, and stainless steel sink with onboard water supply. A fold-down rear bench seat converted to a bed and the pop-top included a fold-out bed; these models could sleep four adults. A 'Weekender ' version that lacked the refrigerator, propane stove, and sink of the full 'camper' versions offered an optional removable cabinet with a 12 volt cooler and self-contained sink. In 1984, the Wolfsburg edition was configured with a rear bench seat and two forward-facing middle seats. Under the bench seat, which folded down to make full-size bed, was a storage compartment and a rear heater. Wolfsburg Edition \\"Weekender\\" models featured two rear-facing seats behind the front seats in place of a centre bench seat and a table that could fold up from the sidewall ‚Äì or fold down when not in use. Multivan models featured Wolfsburg Edition trim and an interior with rear-facing seats, the same fold up table, a pop-top with an upper bed, and cabinet behind the rear seat on the driver's side. Wolfsburg Edition and camper van vehicles were outfitted for Volkswagen by the Westfalia factory. Syncro models were manufactured in limited numbers from 1984 through 1992, with the four-wheel-drive system added by Steyr-Daimler-Puch Works in Graz, Austria, with a short wheelbase and 48/52 front/rear weight distribution. Model years 1980 through 1985 featured round sealed beam headlights. Subsequent models for North American and European markets featured round sealed beam headlights or smaller square headlights, with the primary lights outboard and high beams inboard. Later models from South Africa returned to round headlight housings for both the primary headlights and high-beams. This is known to VW enthusiasts as the \\"South African look,\\" and swapping the square headlights to round headlights is a popular conversion by van owners with non-South African vehicles. The T3 was replaced by the T4 (Eurovan) in the U.S. market in 1993 (1992 saw no Volkswagen vans imported to the U.S. market, aside from custom campers sold by companies other than Volkswagen). Top-of-the-line Wolfsburg Edition Westfalia Campers, which had all options, were at the top of the price range. In addition to the camper models, a Carat trim level was available for 1990 and 1991 model years. This model included all options available for the Transporter configuration. Some models featured optional aluminum alloy wheels. South African models Production of the T3 continued in South Africa until June 2002, when, due to the economies of scale, Volkswagen SA were obliged to discontinue production after parts supply started to become an issue. The South African T3s post-1991 had a face-lift which included modified front door sheet metal, bigger side windows behind the B pillars, and different rear grilles in the D pillars. The bodyshell is a true RHD design lacking the unused door track cover on the offside and LHD wiper arm mount points as found on earlier models (which were originally designed as an adaptation of a LHD Twin-sliding door bodyshell). On models with 5-cylinder engines, the boot floor was raised to accommodate the taller engine and has small storage areas either side of the engine hatch. Internal changes include a fully padded dashboard featuring a smaller glove box and updated vacuum-powered ventilation controls operated by round knobs rather than slide levers, the fuse box was also relocated to the right-hand side of the steering column. At the front of the vehicle twin-headlamps in both round and rectangular configurations were fitted along with a full width lower grille incorporating the indicator lenses, which were changed from amber to smoked lenses from 1999 onwards, this grille and headlight combination was not found anywhere else in the world. These later South African T3s became known as Big Window T3s due to their larger side windows. In January 1991 the 2.1 Wasserboxer engines were replaced with five-cylinder Audi engines in the \\"Microbus\\" and \\"Caravelle\\", while a VW 1.8 inline-four cylinder engine was used in the \\"Kombi\\" and \\"Van\\" models. A 2.1 Wasserboxer Syncro Big Window model was also added, in Microbus or Caravelle trim. 89 big window syncros were assembled/sold in 1992, the big window body was used in the syncro from 1990 and in 1991, mixed in the \\"German\\" small window body, so exact numbers of big window syncros are unknown. The 89 only figure is a myth, 89 were sold in 1992. The syncro model was discontinued in 1992. There were also 4 or 5 factory, VWSA, built 5 cyl 2.5i syncros, with k-jetronic fuel injection, 16\\" rear trailing arms and brakes and 15\\" wheels. One was in a small window body, 3x are known to survive, 1x small window, and 2x big window syncros. The five- cylinder T3's came out initially with a 2.5 litre k-jet tronic fuel-injected engine in 1991, but this was replaced in March 1995 with a 2.6 litre with an improved fuel injection system and two styles of 15\\" alloy wheels as standard (Rhein or Starburst) along with larger ventilated front disc brakes. The automatic option for the 2.5 was dropped, leaving only the five-speed manual. A slightly lower spec 2.3 five-cylinder fuel-injected model was introduced four months after the 2.6 but was equipped with a 4-speed transmission and modified wrap-around steel bumpers. There was also a basic bus, with an i4 slant 1.8 carburetor engine, the 1.8 carb motor was a Golf derived motor, fitted into the bus like an i4 diesel in a t3. It was called the \\"volksie bus\\", it was a basic bus, with steel 15\\" rims, single round headlights, steel wrap-around bumpers, no aircon or pas. Near the end of production, a top of the range Caravelle 2.6i known as the \\"Exclusiv\\" incorporated two rear-facing seats in place of the centre bench seat, a fridge and a folding table in the back of the vehicle and Carat 2 alloy wheels. A Microbus 2.6i with similar features, but with Rhein alloy wheels were known as the \\"Activ\\". The last T3 off the production line in Uitenhage on Friday 16 June 2002 was a gold- coloured Microbus 2.6i which Volkswagen SA retained for their AutoPavilion, Place of Cars and Legends, which first opened its doors in 2004. The vehicle was later written off in a transporter roll-over accident in November 2006, after returning from a display in Cape Town. ;Five-cylinder Audi Engines used: * 1.8 i4 (AAX) 70kw @5200rpm * 2.3i i5(AFU) 90kW * 2.5i i5(AAY) 100kW * 2.6i i5(ADV) 100kW @5200rpm Approximately 45 WBX6 3. 2i Oettinger engines were imported to South Africa. Safety and Crash Tests In 1994, the Swedish insurance company, Folksam tested a Vanagon T3 in a head-on collision with a Volvo 700 series wagon (estate). The crash test was full-frontal (50/50) at 31 mph (58 Km/H). The result was that the driver of the Volvo would have received a head injury criterion (HIC) of 3868. An HIC of 1000 is considered deadly. The Vanagon driver would receive a HIC of only 155. Furthermore, the \\"chest impact\\" for the Volvo driver was 65. A chest impact of 60 is considered deadly. The Vanagon driver's impact was only 30.[Allianz-Zentrum fur Technik Gmbh Crashverhalten von Frontlenkern der 1 Tonnen Klasse 4 June 1984]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUOM-_K-ODo Furthermore, the German engineering testing laboratory for the insurance industry Allianz Zentrum f√ºr Technik (AZT) performed tests on 4 June 1984 in Japan. The results were published in the September 1984 ADAC Motorwelt journal. The Vanagon/Caravelle with subjected to crash tests into a fixed 40% barrier at 35 Km/H, which corresponds to a head-on collision at 50-55 Km/H. According to AZT, this test is said to be representative of 90% of all accidents. A series of these crash tests were performed, which compared the T3 to similar vans manufactured by Nissan, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, and two vans from Toyota. The written results stated, \\"The Volkswagen Transporter type 2 affords excellent passenger safety\\". \\"The legs were not endangered. And the legroom was only slightly restricted.\\" All doors opened easily. With regard to repair of the vehicles after the crash tests, the five Japanese vehicles were declared a \\"total loss\\" or \\"write-offs\\". Regarding the Vanagon, the report states \\"It would be possible to fully repair the VW type 2 at reasonable cost\\". In a 47 mph (75 Km/H) crash between the front of a Volkswagen LT31 (structurally the same as a T3) and rear of a stationary full-size Chevrolet Impala, the rear of the Impala was completely destroyed with the rear trunk being pushed up to just behind the driver's seat. Yet, the VW remained \\"operational\\" (drivable) and \\"the doors could be opened relatively easily\\" And \\"the deformation of the interior was negligible\\", as declared by the testing agency. In an \\"overturn\\" test of \\"a fully equipped VW (Type 2 T3) Westfalia customized camping vehicle\\" traveling 'sideways' at a speed of 31 mph (50 Km/h) on a specially designed 'sled' that 'launched' the vehicle causing two complete rollovers, the report found that \\"the roof remained fully intact and the doors remained closed\\". The report went on to say, \\"If passengers wear seatbelts, the danger of injury in this kind of accident is relatively low\\". In another rollover test, the T3 was rolled down a 32ft high (10 M) hill. This is equivalent to a 3-story building. This resulted in the van flipping over 4 1/2 times. It was reported, \\"the shape of the body and the roof remained intact.\\" These vans were made with a \\"forward deformation zone\\" consisting of four \\"side members\\" below and in front of the passenger compartment making a four-pronged forked frame with a \\"deformation element\\" which is mounted in front of this making it extremely effective at absorbing impact. The front cab has extensive protection by means of four vertical struts that connect an impact-absorbing box section cross- member. Additionally, there is another box framed horizontal strut on the inside of the vehicle that attaches to the door frames. And another yet goes through the sides of the doors to help protect passengers from lateral impact. The steering wheel has two energy-absorbing buckle points, with a detachable steering column that prevents the steering wheel from being pushed into the cabin. And the spare tire, which is mounted on the underside in the front of the vehicle, is also used to absorb shock. Today The T3 has a large cult following, especially the Westfalia camper version, and many owners have had the VW engines replaced, due to their reputation of being underpowered and unreliable, particularly the Wasserboxer. Subaru engines are one of the most popular engines to install to increase power and reliability, as their overhead camshaft four-cylinder boxer engines are very similar in size and configuration to the original VW pushrod engines. Other conversions have included Porsche 911 engines, VW Rabbit diesel engines, Golf/Jetta petrol engines and Ford Zetec engines. Five-cylinder Audi engines were used in South Africa on higher-trim vans after the Wasserboxer engine was discontinued in 1991, until the T3 was discontinued in 2002.

It is the main river of Moravia, which derives its name from it. The river originates on the Kr√°lick√Ω Snƒõ≈æn√≠k mountain in the north-eastern corner of Pardubice Region, near the border between the Czech Republic and Poland and has a vaguely southward trajectory. The lower part of the river's course forms the border between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and then between Austria and Slovakia. Etymology Though the German name March may refer to Mark, \\"border, frontier\\" (cf. English march), the river's name more probably is derived from Proto-Indo-European *mori, \\"waters\\" (mare). It was first documented as Maraha in an 892 deed. History The shores of the Morava have been inhabited for a very long time. The village of , on the Austrian part of the river, was the location of a human settlement already 30,000 years ago. Agriculture began to be practiced in the Morava valley approximately 7,000 years ago, and fortified settlements began to appear during the New Stone Age. The lower part of the river, downstream of the confluence with the Thaya at Hohenau an der March, which today marks the Austro-Slovakian border, is one of the oldest national boundaries still extant in continental Europe: it was the eastern boundary of the Carolingian Empire with the Avar Khaganate around 800, and from the 10th century onward marked the border of the Imperial marcha orientalis, later Duchy of Austria, with the Kingdom of Hungary (within the Habsburg Monarchy during 1526-1918 because of imperial expansion). During the Cold War, this section of the river was part of the Iron Curtain, forming the frontier between Austria and Czechoslovakia. =1997 flooding= In July 1997, the Morava basin (especially its northern and eastern part) was affected by heavy stratiform rain, which lasted several days and caused catastrophic floods, which also affected the Oder River basin in Poland and Germany. In the Czech Republic, 49 people lost their life, more than 250 villages had to be evacuated and the total damage was 63 billion crowns. =History of the river= File:NHM - Stillfried Skelette.jpgSkeletons of a family (9th century BC) of the Urnfield culture site at Stillfried File:Schloss Hof 3.

The lowlands formed by the river are the Upper Moravian Vale or Hornomoravsk√Ω √∫val and then the Lower Morava Valley or Dolnomoravsk√Ω √∫val in Moravia, the Morava Field or Marchfeld in Lower Austria, and the Z√°horie Lowland or Z√°horsk√° n√≠≈æina in Slovakia. The latter three are actually continuous parts of one large basin, forming the major part of the Vienna Basin. In the Czech Republic, there are some larger towns lying upon Morava, particularly Olomouc, Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ, Otrokovice, Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ and Hodon√≠n. Brno, the second largest city of Czech Republic, lies within the river basin. The catchment area of the river has a population of 3,5 million people. Downstream from Hodon√≠n, the river flows along sparsely inhabited, forested border area, all the way to its outfall into the Danube, just below the Dev√≠n Castle at the outskirts of the Slovak capital Bratislava. After 354 km of its course, Morava feeds the Danube by an average discharge rate of 120 m3/s, gathered from a drainage area of 26 658 km2. The river's longest tributary by far is the Thaya (in German) or Dyje (in Czech), flowing in at the tripoint of Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The biggest tributary from the left is Beƒçva. The Morava is a lowland river with a basin that consists to 51 percent of plains; mountains make up only seven percent of the basin while 35 percent are considered highland. The average slope of the river is 1.8‚Ä∞ and at the confluence 4‚Ä∞. The bedrock of the river basin is mostly crystalline bedrock and flysch. The Morava river is unusual in that it is a European blackwater river. =Course of the river= Image:Pramen Moravy (1).JPGThe source of the Morava on Kr√°lick√Ω Snƒõ≈æn√≠k Image:DOE Devin.jpgThe confluence of the Morava and the Danube Image:Kostel ƒåeskobratrsk√© c√≠rkve evangelick√©, Olomouc.jpgMorava in Olomouc Image:Zusammenfluss von March und Thaya, Dreil√§ndereck AT-CZ-SK 01.jpgThaya-Morava confluence - intersection of three borders, Austrian, Czech and Slovak Ecology The Morava river forms an important link between the Danube Valley and the plains of northern Europe, for animals as well as, at least historically, for humans. Its weak slope across flat plains furthermore means that the river is prone to meander and flood, creating vast floodplains. Because of these reasons, the floodplains of the Morava river are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems in Europe. Its richness in plant and animal species (some 12,000 species have been identified) ranks it second in diversity only to the Danube Delta. During the 20th century however, large tracts of the river, especially downstream from Litovel, have been regulated with the ensuing effect of loss of inundation areas (floodplains). Since the river basin is densely populated and, especially the Czech part, industrialised, the river also receives a lot of wastewater. Agriculture also contributes to spreading nitrogen and other nutrients into the river. Nevertheless, the central part of the river has retained much of its natural character and in later years conscious efforts have been made to protect the nature and ecosystem of the river basin. =Ecology of the river= Image:Morava's flooded forest 01.jpgFlooded forest Image:Fr√ºhlingshochwasser untere Marchauen.jpgFlooded meadow File:Angerner und D√ºrnkruter Marchschlingen 13.jpgOne of many oxbow lakes of the Morava File:Tabule Oskovec II..JPGNature park Str√°≈ænick√© Pomorav√≠ in Czech Republic, one of several protected natural areas along the Morava See also *March of Austria *March of Moravia References  External links  * Austria‚ÄìSlovakia border Czech Republic‚ÄìSlovakia border International rivers of Europe Moravia Rivers of Lower Austria Rivers of Slovakia Rivers of the Olomouc Region Rivers of the Pardubice Region Rivers of the South Moravian Region Rivers of the Zl√≠n Region Tributaries of the Danube Rivers of Austria Border rivers ","title":"Morava (river)"},{"id":"960256","text":"In art, an underpainting is an initial layer of paint applied to a ground, which serves as a base for subsequent layers of paint. Underpaintings are often monochromatic and help to define color values for later painting. There are several different types of underpainting, such as veneda, verdaccio, morellone and grisaille.Underpaint. In: Underpainting gets its name because it is painting that is intended to be painted over (see overpainting) in a system of working in layers. There is a popular misconception that underpainting should be monochromatic, perhaps in gray-scales. A multi-color underpainting was thought to be more useful by artists such as Giotto (whose technique is described in detail by Cennino Cennini), as well as by Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden (whose technique has been studied with modern scientific analysis). This technique was pioneered by Titian in the High Renaissance. The colors of the underpainting can be optically mingled with the subsequent overpainting, without the danger of the colors physically blending and becoming muddy. If underpainting is done properly, it facilitates overpainting. If it seems that one has to fight to obscure the underpainting, it is a sign that it was not done properly.

In 2007, employees were issued the wristbands upon signing a loyalty oath. According to a senior CFC officer, the consequence of not getting such a wristband was \\"I will lose my job.\\" A loyalty oath is a pledge of allegiance to an organization, institution, or state of which an individual is a member. In the United States, such an oath has often indicated that the affiant has not been a member of a particular organization or organizations mentioned in the oath. In the United States =Civil War and Reconstruction= During the Civil War the United States federal government required all naval shipyard workers to sign a loyalty oath. During the American Civil War, political prisoners and Confederate prisoners of war were often released upon taking an \\"oath of allegiance\\". Lincoln's ten percent plan featured an oath to \\"faithfully support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and the union of the States thereunder\\" as a condition for a Presidential pardon. During Reconstruction, retroactive loyalty oaths were proposed by Radical Republicans, which would have barred former Confederates and Confederate sympathizers from federal, state, or local offices. Beginning in 1862 all U.S. Naval shipyard employees were required to sign a loyalty oath as a condition of employment. =Roosevelt/Truman era= Page one of Executive Order 9835, signed by Harry S. Truman in 1947 In support of Roosevelt's National Recovery Administration, 100,000 school children marched to Boston Common and swore a loyalty oath administered by the mayor, \\"I promise as a good American citizen to do my part for the NRA. I will buy only where the Blue Eagle flies.\\" Loyalty oaths were common during World War II. Another use of loyalty oaths in the United States was during the 1950s and 1960s. The Red Scare during the 1950s and the Congressional hearings chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy helped to sustain a national mood of concern about communist agents and a fear such agents may injure the U.S. government through espionage, outright violence, or speech.  Executive Order 9835 \\"Loyalty Order\\" (1947) On March 21, 1947, concerned with Soviet subversive penetration and infiltration into the United States government by American citizens who held oaths of allegiance to a foreign power during wartime, President Harry S Truman instituted a Loyalty Program by signing Executive Order 9835, also known as the \\"Loyalty Order.\\" It required loyalty oaths and background investigations on persons deemed suspect of holding party membership in organizations that advocated violent and anti-democratic programs. The University of California loyalty oath (1950) The Levering Act was a law enacted by the U.S. state of California in 1950. It required state employees to subscribe to a loyalty oath that specifically disavowed radical beliefs. It was aimed in particular at employees of the University of California. in January 1950, 750 faculty members had approved a resolution to oppose the university's regents and create a committee to coordinate legal action against the university should an oath be required. Several teachers resigned in protest or lost their positions when they refused to sign the loyalty oath. Among those who left were the psychologist Erik Erikson and the classical scholar Ludwig Edelstein, both of them Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. In August 1950, the regents fired 31 faculty members who refused to sign the oath. Those who were terminated sued, and by 1952 had been rehired when the university declined to pursue its case against them in court. One of the fired faculty members, the physics professor David Saxon went on with his career and was appointed president of the entire University of California system in 1975, a job he held until 1983. Garner v. Board of Public Works (1951) Typically, a loyalty oath has wording similar to that mentioned in the U.S Supreme Court decision of Garner v. Board of Public Works:Garner v. Board of Public Works, 341 U.S. 716 (1951) > I further swear (or affirm) that I do not advise, advocate or teach, and > have not within the period beginning five (5) years prior to the effective > date of the ordinance requiring the making of this oath or affirmation, > advised, advocated or taught, the overthrow by force, violence or other > unlawful means, of the Government of the United States of America or of the > State of California and that I am not now and have not, within said period, > been or become a member of or affiliated with any group, society, > association, organization or party which advises, advocates or teaches, or > has, within said period, advised, advocated or taught, the overthrow by > force, violence or other unlawful means of the Government of the United > States of America, or of the State of California.

Speiser v. Randall (1958) In Speiser v. Randall,Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513 (1958) the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the State of California's loyalty oath, as required by a California law enacted in 1954, as a condition of exemption from property tax. In applying for property tax exemption as a veteran of World War II, ACLU lawyer Lawrence Speiser had refused to sign the loyalty oath. The court ruled that because the state required the claimant to show they are not advocating state overthrow and hence are not criminals within the applicable laws, the loyalty oath requirement to obtain the tax exemption is unconstitutional. The burden of proof for a criminal action rests on the state and not on the individual private citizen. =1960s= The oaths were repeatedly challenged on grounds that they violated the principles of freedom of speech and freedom of association. The United States Supreme Court avoided addressing these problems during the McCarthy Era. During the 1960s, it began striking down such oaths on the basis of vagueness and undue breadth. October 16, 1961 Tobias Simon and Howard Dixon argued Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction before the Supreme Court.This is a link to the argument from Oyes Cramp v. Bd. Of Public Instruction - Oral Argument In 1962 the Court struck down the Florida requirement that teachers swear \\"I have not and will not lend my aid, support, advice, counsel or influence to the Communist party\\". This decision was followed in 1964 by its lack of support for two oaths, one of which required teachers to promote respect for the flag, reverence for law and order, and loyalty to the institutions of the United States and the State of Washington. Arizona and New York teacher oaths affirming lack of association with subversive organizations were struck down in 1966 and 1967. New York Education Law Section 3002 requires that any ‚Äòteacher, instructor or professor in any [state] school or institution in the public school system ‚Ä¶ or in any school, college, university or other educational institution‚Äô sign an oath pledging support for the federal and state constitutions. The law does not apply to foreign nationals, but only to United States citizens. The law was enacted in 1934 in response to a nationwide campaign by the American Legion.David Halberstam, \\"27 on Adelphi Faculty File Suit Challenging State Loyalty Oath\\", New York Times, November 30, 1966, pg. 27. The law was challenged by a group of 27 faculty members from Adelphi University in 1966 because the oath constrained free speech, and because it selectively applied to faculty members but not staff. For unknown reasons, Adelphi faculty had never been required to sign the oath until 1966 when a staff member in the New York State Education Department discovered the oversight. On January 22, 1968, after moving through the judicial system, the United States Supreme Court affirmed an earlier District Court decision upholding the constitutionality of the law.\\"JUSTICES UPHOLD A TEACHERS' OATH; Back State Law Requiring a Constitutional Pledge\\", New York Times, January 23, 1968, pg. 21. This was the first occasion on which the Supreme Court evaluated the constitutionality of oaths of this type. The last major loyalty oath case heard by the court was decided in 1972, when it upheld a requirement that State of Massachusetts employees swear to uphold and defend the Constitution and to \\"oppose the overthrow of the [government] by force, violence, or by any illegal or unconstitutional method\\". =1970s‚Äì1990s= =2000s= 2004 Bush presidential campaign During the 2004 presidential campaign, the campaign of George W. Bush sometimes required all attendants at its rallies to take an oath. Those who refused to take the oath were not allowed to attend the rally. The \\"loyalty oath\\" was actually a pledge of endorsement. These endorsements were used during some of the campaign rallies in 2004. The Bush campaign asserted that the oath was valid because the president was conducting a partisan campaign event. Opponents countered that the oath was intrusive to individual conscience and denied general public access to the president. California The California state constitution requires all state workers who are US citizens to sign a loyalty oath as a term of employment.California Constitution, Article XX , Section 3 On February 28, 2008, the California State University, East Bay fired Marianne Kearney-Brown, a Quaker, for refusing to do so without inserting a reservation that her defense of the state and country would be done \\"nonviolently.\\"Quaker teacher fired for changing loyalty oath, San Francisco Chronicle, February 29, 2008 She was reinstated a week later, when she agreed to sign the oath when accompanied by a document prepared by the university that included the clarification \\"Signing the oath does not carry with it any obligation or requirement that public employees bear arms or otherwise engage in violence.\\"Pacifist Cal State teacher gets job back, San Francisco Chronicle, March 8, 2008 The text of that oath begins: \\"STATE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.\\" Arizona Arizona requires all employees of the state, its counties and localities to sign an oath of loyalty to the country and the state. The oath requirement predates statehood; it was successfully challenged in the 1960s over wording banning Communist Party membership, and was rewritten in 2003. Ohio In the March 2008 State of Ohio presidential primary, some people might have been required to sign a loyalty oath in order to vote. Voters who wish to switch their party affiliation on Primary Election Day and who are challenged are supposed to sign a statement \\"stating that the person desires to be affiliated with and supports the principles of the political party whose ballot the person desires to vote.\\" The statement is signed under penalty of \\"election falsification.\\" If the challenged person refuses to sign the statement under penalty of election falsification, he is given a provisional ballot. The Cleveland Plain Dealer, among others, thus describes the nature of the statement and effect of \\"election falsification\\": Anyone who signs this loyalty oath, but does not intend to honor it, can be prosecuted for \\"election falsification\\", a fifth- degree felony. The statute, however, describes the offense differently: \\"No person, either orally or in writing, on oath lawfully administered or in a statement made under penalty of election falsification, shall knowingly state a falsehood as to a material matter relating to an election in a proceeding before a court, tribunal, or election official, or in a matter in relation to which an oath or statement under penalty of election falsification is authorized by law...\\" Thus the requirement is, arguably, more a statement of current intent than a loyalty oath's promise of future support. Israel Avigdor Lieberman proposed that Israel's citizens should sign a loyalty oath or lose their right to vote. In his The Jewish Week article, Lieberman tried to explain his party's \\"no loyalty ‚Äì no citizenship\\" campaign by writing: \\"During Operation Cast Lead in Gaza, I was appalled by the calls for the destruction of the State of Israel and for renewed suicide bombings that some Israeli Arab leaders called for at pro-Hamas rallies. Although 'responsible citizenship' had always been part of our platform, I realized that this was a burning issue that had to take top priority.\\" He explained his \\"responsible citizenship\\" platform and compared his position to the express policy of nations around the world, saying: \\"In the U.S., those requesting a Green Card must take an oath that they will fulfill the rights and duties of citizenship.\\" On 10 October 2010 the Israeli cabinet approved a loyalty oath bill requiring all future non-Jews applying for an Israeli citizenship to swear loyalty to Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. However, on October 18, prime minister Netanyahu ordered Justice minister Ya'akov Ne'eman to extend Cabinet-level debate on the bill in order to add amendments which make the loyalty oath universal to both Jewish and non-Jewish immigrants who seek citizenship. This inclusion of Jewish immigrants was supported by the Anti- Defamation League.

He investigated unexplained disappearances and other unusual events related to the Bermuda Triangle to answer queries he was getting as a research librarian, and ended up writing a book debunking most of the mysteries touted by other writers about that location. Early life and education Kusche was born in Racine, Wisconsin, and his family moved to the Phoenix, Arizona area when he was six. Interested in aviation, Kusche qualified for a commercial pilot's license at age 19, was a commercial pilot by age 21, a flight instructor by age 24, and an instrument instructor. In 1964, Kusche graduated from Arizona State University (ASU). He completed a training course to become a commercial flight engineer, but on the day he was supposed to report for work, he decided he didn't like the prospect of a career sitting in front of hundreds of switches and dials unable to see out of the airplane. He resigned and returned to Arizona to become a high school math teacher and librarian. Later, he acquired a master's degree in library science and began working at ASU's Hayden Library in June, 1969. Career Kusche is the author of Larry Kusche's Popcorn Cookery, a 1977 cookbook detailing recipes involving popcorn, including baked goods made from ground-up popcorn \\"flour\\", and Shape Up Your Hips and Thighs. Kusche took a leave-of-absence to complete his first book. After the success of the Bermuda Triangle book, Kusche abandoned his career as a librarian to become a writer. He has worked as a technical writer in the Phoenix area. After the publication of his investigative books, Kusche became a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). =Bermuda Triangle= As a research librarian at ASU, Kusche received queries for all types of information from students writing term papers. In the early 1970s, he became interested in the Bermuda Triangle mystery, as he was confronted by numerous queries related to the Triangle. This prompted Kusche and fellow librarian Debbie Blouin to start gathering information, mostly by writing hundreds of letters to request information from official sources. Initially, the two librarians began selling (for $2) a bibliography of the information about the Bermuda Triangle that they had acquired. Later, it occurred to Kusche that somebody should put down all of the information they had gathered into a book. When the publishing company Harper and Row ordered a copy of the bibliography, Kusche sent them a copy with a note scribbled on it asking if they were interested in a book about the subject that he was writing ‚Äì and they were. Initially intrigued by the mysteries surrounding the Triangle, Kusche's research convinced him that virtually all the incidents had been caused by storms or accidents, or they happened outside the Triangle, or no proof could be found that they ever occurred at all. His conclusion was that the Triangle was a \\"manufactured mystery,\\" the result of poor research and reporting, and the occasional deliberate falsification of facts. Kusche originally included a long chapter in his Bermuda Triangle book about Flight 19, five Navy Avenger torpedo airplanes on a training mission out of Fort Lauderdale Naval Air Station that disappeared in the Atlantic Ocean on December 5, 1945. Kusche later expanded this chapter into a book, The Disappearance of Flight 19. He studied the Navy's report of the investigation, interviewed many of the Navy personnel who were involved at the time, and flew the likely route of the missing aircraft himself. At the time, the lost flight of five torpedo bombers was said to be a victim of the mysterious forces in the Triangle. Kusche explained why the flight leader erroneously thought he was in the Florida Keys, why he said his compass had failed, and why no wreckage has yet been found.

The attack resulted in a ceasefire between Russia and Chechen separatists, and peace talks (which later failed) between Russia and the Chechens. Initial attack Basayev's men crossed into Stavropol Krai concealed in a column of military trucks. At about noon on 14 June, they stormed the main police station and the city hall, where they raised Chechen flags over government offices. After several hours, in the face of Russian reinforcements, the Chechens retreated to the residential district and regrouped in the city hospital. There they took hostage between 1,500 and 1,800 people (some estimates reaching as high as 2,000 or even 2,500), most of them civilians (including about 150 children and a number of women with newborn infants). On their way to the hospital they shot 100 civilians that refused to cooperate. –ë—É–¥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫ Hostage crisis Basayev issued an ultimatum, threatening to kill the hostages unless his demands were met. These included an end to the First Chechen War, and direct negotiations by Russia with the Chechen representatives. Also, Basayev demanded that the Russian authorities bring reporters to the scene and allow them to enter the Chechen position in the hospital. Russian president Boris Yeltsin immediately vowed to do everything possible to free the hostages, denouncing the attack as \\"unprecedented in cynicism and cruelty.\\"ASSAULT AT HIGH NOON, TIME, 26 June 1995 At about 8 pm on 15 June, the Chechens killed a hostage.

The forces employed were MVD police (\\"militsiya\\") and Internal Troops, along with spetsnaz (special forces) from the Federal Security Service (FSB), including the elite Alpha Group. The strike force attacked the hospital compound at dawn on the fourth day, meeting fierce resistance. After several hours of fighting in which many hostages were killed by crossfire, a local ceasefire was agreed on and 227 hostages were released; 61 others were freed by the Russian troops. A second Russian attack on the hospital a few hours later also failed, and so did a third, resulting in even more casualties. The Russian authorities accused the Chechens of using the hostages as human shields. Yeltsin's human rights advisor Sergey Kovalyov described the scene: \\"In half an hour the hospital was burning, and it was not until the next morning that we found out what happened there as a result of this shooting. I saw with my own eyes pieces of human flesh stuck to the walls and the ceiling and burned corpses...\\" Resolution of the crisis On 18 June, negotiations between Basayev and Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin led to a compromise which became a turning point for the First Chechen War. In exchange for release of the hostages, Russia agreed to halt military actions in Chechnya and begin negotiations.The Chronicles of Hell The released hostages were especially angered by Yeltsin's decision to let the rebels go free.Yeltsin draws bitter wrath of Chechens CNN, 22 April 1996 Yeltsin meanwhile had gone to the summit of the Group of Seven in Halifax, Canada. After meeting with Yeltsin, the Group of Seven condemned violence on both sides of the Chechen conflict. When asked about the crisis by a journalist, Yeltsin denounced the rebels as ‚Ä≥horrible criminals with black bands on their foreheads‚Ä≥ (‚Ä≥–≠—Ç–æ –æ–≥–æ–ª—Ç–µ–ª—ã–µ –±–∞–Ω–¥–∏—Ç—ã, –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–µ—à—å, —Å —á—ë—Ä–Ω—ã–º–∏ –ø–æ–≤—è–∑–∫–∞–º–∏‚Ä≥). On 19 June, most of the hostages were released. Basayev's group, with 120 volunteer hostages (including 16 journalists and nine State Duma deputies), traveled uneventfully to the village of Zandak, inside Chechnya, near the border with Dagestan. The remaining hostages were then released; Basayev, accompanied by some of the journalists, went to the village of Dargo, where he was welcomed as a hero. The raid is widely seen as having been the turning point in the war. It boosted morale among Chechen separatists, shocked the Russian public, and discredited the Russian government. The initiated negotiations gave the hostage-takers the critically needed time to rest and rearm. Until the end of the conflict, the Russian forces never regained the initiative. Casualties and damage According to official figures, 129 civilians were killed and 415 were injured in the entire event (of whom 18 later died of their wounds).History of Chechen rebels' hostage taking Gazeta.Ru, 24 October 2002 This includes at least 105 hostage fatalities. However, according to an independent estimate 166 hostages were killed and 541 injured in the special forces attack on the hospital.Russia: A Timeline Of Terrorism Since 1995 , Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 30 August 2006Adam Dolnik, Understanding Terrorist Innovation: Technology, Tactics and Global Trends, 2007 (p. 105) At least 11 Russian police officers and 14 soldiers were killed.

Political aftermath The government's handling of the Budyonnovsk was perceived as inept by many Russians. The State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament passed a motion of no confidence by 241 to 72. However, this was seen as purely symbolic, and the government did not resign. Still, the debacle cost both Stepashin and interior minister Viktor Yerin their jobs; they resigned on 30 June 1995. Basayev's force suffered 11 men killed and one missing; most of their bodies were returned to Chechnya in a freezer truck.

Grayson was the author of Birds of the Pacific Slope (1853‚Äì69), which he considered to be a completion of John James Audubon's Birds of America. Early life Grayson was born August 20, 1819, in the northwest corner of Louisiana, on the Ouachita River, where his father had a cotton plantation. At his local school, the teachers were poorly trained, so later on, his father sent him to St. Mary's College in St. Louis, Missouri. There, they discouraged him from studying art. Moving west After his father died, Mr. Grayson used his inherited funds to invest in a small store. Ignoring it for the most part, it went out of business fairly quickly. After meeting frontiersmen in his college years, he developed an insatiable urge to move west. After he married his wife, Frances J. Timmons, on July 21, 1842, they decided to move to California. They had a child in 1845, Edward B. Grayson, and moved to St. Louis to begin the journey. In April 1846, Grayson led a party of migrants out of Independence, Missouri. Other groups joined along the way. At Fort Bridging, a conman, L.W. Hastings, persuaded one of the groups to take a shortcut through a mountain pass. They ended up being the Donner Party. The party Grayson led reached Fort Hall, Idaho. In between there and California, Grayson lost half his group. In late 1846, they reached San Francisco. Early California days Once Grayson settled in San Francisco, he instantly joined a military group led by Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo. During this given period of time, he became a colonel. After he came back from the war, he took no breaks in settling down. He invested in several San Franciscan business ventures, and established the town of Grayson along the San Joaquin river. However, because he had no interest in business, most of these ventures failed. Taxa named after Grayson Two bird species and several other taxa have been named in honor of Grayson. They are mainly from the Revillagigedo Islands and other islands offshore Pacific Mexico. As with much island fauna, several are endangered or extinct: Birds: * Micrathene whitneyi graysoni - Socorro elf owl (probably extinct since c. 1970) * Mimus graysoni - Socorro mockingbird (critically endangered) * Parula pitiayumi graysoni - Socorro tropical parula * Zenaida graysoni - Socorro dove (extinct in the wild) Other: * Cambarus graysoni - a Cambaridae crayfish * Ochrotrichia graysoni - a Hydroptilidae caddisfly * Sylvilagus graysoni - Tres Marias cottontail rabbit (endangered) Research resources * Guide to the Andrew Jackson Grayson Papers at The Bancroft Library  * External links * Grayson Spends Christmas in Mazatlan on 1866. 1819 births 1869 deaths American ornithologists American bird artists 19th-century American painters American male painters 19th-century male artists ","title":"Andrew J.

He has written under several pseudonyms, including \\"John Vincent\\" and \\"Nicholas Adams\\". He lives in Long Island, New York. While his wife is a US citizen, Peel continues to travel under a British passport. Career During the 1980s, Peel wrote a licensed spin-off novel based on the popular 1960s TV series The Avengers, titled Too Many Targets. He is also known for his various books based on Doctor Who, Star Trek and James Bond Jr. (written as \\"John Vincent\\"). =Doctor Who books= A friend of the television writer Terry Nation, Peel wrote novelisations of several Doctor Who stories for Target Books featuring Nation's Daleks; he is reportedly one of the few writers to have been willing to do so, given the high percentage of the author's fee that Nation's agents demanded for the rights to use the Daleks. For similar reasons, Peel is one of the few novelists to have used the Daleks in full-length, original Doctor Who novels, examples of which include War of the Daleks (1997) and Legacy of the Daleks (1998), written for the BBC Books Eighth Doctor Adventures range. Neither novel was especially well received by fans of the series, in part due to Peel's re-writing of Dalek history as depicted in the TV series (in particular the destruction of Skaro in the 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks), to bring their story more into line with Nation's vision. With the publication of Timewyrm: Genesys (1991), Peel became the first author to write a full-length Doctor Who novel, featuring the Doctor, not to be based on either a TV or radio script. He had been selected by editor Peter Darvill-Evans to launch the Virgin New Adventures range, to resume the story of the Doctor's travels from where the now-cancelled TV series had left off. He also wrote the Evolution (1994) for their sister range, Missing Adventures (featuring previous Doctors and companions), and also The Gallifrey Chronicles (1991, not to be confused with the Eighth Doctor Adventures book), a compendium of the history of the Doctor's planet, Gallifrey.

It was endemic to Socorro Island in the Revillagigedo Islands off the west coast of Mexico. The last sighting in its natural habitat was in 1972. There are not more than 200 and probably fewer than 100 purebred birds in captivity. A reintroduction program is in the early stages of preparation.BLI (2004), Schmechel (2006) It is a close relative of the mourning and eared doves, particularly the formerJohnson & Clayton (2000) and was at one time considered a subspecies. In captivity, it hybridizes with the former and almost all privately owned birds as well as several of the captive breeding programs are known or strongly suspected to be hybrids. These are excluded from the reintroduction program as there is evidence of unique adaptations in the Socorro species. The scientific name commemorates Z√©na√Øde Laetitia Julie Bonaparte and the American ornithologist and artist Andrew Jackson Grayson. Description The Socorro dove isSchmechel (2006) a medium-sized, principally terrestrial dove with long legs for a zenaida dove. It is long and weighs on average. In overall color pattern, it agrees with its relatives. It is considered to be a stronger-colored insular representative of the mourning dove. The male is deep cinnamon on its head and underparts, with an ear streak like its relatives. The nape is blue-grey and the neck has an iridescent pink patch, most prominent after moult. The upperparts are rufous brown. Female and juvenile coloration is slightly duller. The most conspicuous differences from the mourning dove, darker coloration and more well-developed feet, were useful amid the dark lava rock and the shady forests of its island home, where native mammalian predators were absent but constant threats from red-tailed hawks and great frigatebirds were present.Brattstrom & Howell (1956) The advertising call begins with a disyllabic coo, followed by three single calls, and ends with another disyllabic coo: \\"Coo-oo, OO, OO, OO, Coo-oo\\". Each of these 5 elements takes a little less than one second. The arid and fairly barren Clari√≥n Island, some west of Socorro, has an endemic subspecies of the mourning dove, Zenaida macroura clarionensis. These birds are roughly intermediate in appearance between the Socorro dove and the mainland mourning doves. It is highly likely that they represent a later colonization by mourning doves (rather than earlier stock), which evolved its phenotype independently from but in parallel with the Socorro birds. This would mean that predation by great frigatebirds is significant enough to select towards a cryptic darkening of the plumage, as these are the only predators of Z. m. clarionensis. On a semidesert island such as Clari√≥n, birds would be expected to evolve towards lighter plumage, to better withstand the heat and lack of reliable freshwater sources, in accordance with Gloger's Rule. The upper elevation limit of the doves is 950 m. Ecology There is marked behavioral difference to the mourning dove. When Andrew Jackson Grayson discussed the species, he called it the \\"solitary dove\\" because he never saw more than one male and one female together. The doves, particularly the adult males, chase away their young as soon as these can fend for their own and the partners split for the time being. This too is believed to be in adaptation to the former dominance of aerial predators, lest local concentrations of birds, let alone young, inexperienced ones, would present easy targets for the hawks. Typical of many birds on islands lacking mammals, Socorro doves show little fear of humans or, fatally, cats. The last habitat in which this dove was found is the low seasonally humid forest above 500 m ASL.BLI (2007) Before the introduction of cats, it seasonally descended into the lowlands where it was \\"common\\" in March 1953 for example. It may be that this coincided with the peak of the breeding season, when many birds had dependent young and dispersed widely to gather more varied food. This was the case in the Socorro mockingbird, the other mid-sized native landbird of Socorro, which apparently has very similar habitat preferences. Its last refuge was dominated by endemic Guettarda insularis, Ilex socorroensis and Sideroxylon socorrense, as well as black cherry (Prunus serotinaProbably ssp. capuli according to biogeography, Brattstrom & Howell (1956) contra CMICD (2007)), Ficus cotinifolia fig trees and Psidium socorrense guavas, apparently all native on Socorro. At least at the time of the last record, it seemed to be dependent on intact understorey of Euphorbiaceae (spurges and relatives)Endemic Acalypha umbrosa and Croton masonii, native Euphorbia anthonyi, E. incerta and manchineel (Hippomane mancinella), and perhaps also introduced Mexican fireplant (Euphorbia heterophylla), E. hirta var. hirta, E. hyssopifolia and E. thymifolia: CMICD (2007) and ferns,Adiantopsis radiata, Asplenium formosum, Asplenium sessilifolium, Mexican resurrection fern (Pleopeltis polypodioides var. aciculare), Polypodium alfredii, Polystichum muricatum, Pteridium caudatum, the Socorro endemic Botrychium socorrense and the Revillagigedos endemic Cheilanthes peninsularis var. insularis maybe because cats hunt less efficiently in these dense tangles. It is frugivorous and, as is often the case in Columbidae, might have played an important role in the reproduction of the trees which dominate its habitat. One of these (S. socorrense) is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN.WCMC (1998) In particular, it was found to associate with the fig trees.Brattstrom & Howell (1956), BLI (2007), CMICD (2007) Virtually nothing is known about breeding in the wild. However, each generation is estimated to be about 6.6 years. Parallels in altitudinal migration with the equally solitary mockingbird might be taken as indication that the breeding activity peaked around March through April. In captivity, the female generally lays two white eggs in a nest box 1‚Äì2.5 m above ground. The incubation lasts from 14 to 17 days, and the young birds fledge after around 14 to 20 days. Extinction in the wild The Socorro dove is thought to have been extirpated mainly by feral cats, but high levels of understorey grazing by sheep could have limited the population. Human hunting might have temporarily brought down numbers, though little permanent settlement exists on Socorro. Cats were introduced apparently in the early 1970s. They do not seem to have been present in 1953.Brattstrom & Howell (1956), BLI (2004, 2007) The species reproduces no less willingly in captivity than other Zenaida doves, provided its different ecological needs are addressed. Most of the surviving birds are in zoos and other facilities in Germany and the United States. On October 30, 2006, the Socorro dove was successfully bred at the London Zoo. The bird was named \\"Arnie\\", after Arnold Schwarzenegger, with reference to his famous line \\"I'll be back\\" (on Socorro Island), although Arnie was subsequently discovered to be female. It is hoped that the descendants of Arnie and her relatives can someday soon be reintroduced into the wild. As of early 2006, it was being prepared to remove the sheep and to rid the island of cats. In the meantime, with the maintenance of the remaining birds, stock for reintroduction is being provided. Reintroduction efforts In order to protect these birds and eventually reintroduce them into the wild, various reintroduction and conservation efforts have germinated. In 1994, the birds' native island of Socorro was declared a biosphere preserve.(Stattersfield et al. 1998, Mart√≠nez-G√≥mez et al. 2003 In addition, as the number of birds in captivity is only slightly above 100, various associations have begun breeding programs. These include the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) as well as zoos in Frankfurt and Cologne.Baptista, L. F.; Mart√≠nez-G√≥mez, J. E. 1996 In 2013, the breeding program was successfully introduced into Mexico by the EAZA in collaboration with various government agencies such as the SEMAR, SEMARNAT, and the Mexican Navy. In 2013, six doves were brought to the Africam Safari in Mexico, the first time since their extinction on Socorro that the doves have been brought to Mexican soil. =Specific actions= The original plan was to reintroduce the birds into Mexico in 2008, but was delayed due to import restrictions and permits. A stock of viable individuals was kept in the US, until finally they were transferred to Mexico in 2013. In 2005 plans were outlined to assess the level of soil erosion on Socorro as a result of vegetation loss. In 2010, by using hunting and telemetry, all sheep had been eradicated from the island.Latofski-Robles et al., 2014 Currently, the problem of cats and house-mice has yet to be resolved on Socorro Island.IUCN Island Invasives: Eradication and Management Avian Malaria and trichomoniasis were detected during screens of other dove populations on neighboring islands in December 2003 and January 2004. As a result, recommendations for protection of the reintroduction population were put forward. In 2008 the Edinburgh and Paignton Zoos sent 12 chicks from their breeding program to the Albuquerque Zoo as part of the collective aggregation effort. In 2006, there was an outbreak of avian influenza in Europe, and therefore 12 doves were sent to Albuquerque Biological Park to create a separate reserve population.http://www.birds.com/blog/edinburgh-zoo-working-hard-to-save-dove- species/ Construction of aviaries on Socorro Island began in 2003 and ended in 2005. In addition to efforts to control cats, humans, and other animals on Socorro Island, efforts are also underway to control locust swarms on the island.Bell, D. A.; Yanga, S.; Martinez-Gomez, J.E.; Pliego, P.E. 2005 Outbreaks of Schistocerca piceifrons have occurred at least twice a year on the island since 1994, and has resulted in damage to native flowers and vegetation.Song et al., 2006Estrada, L.

Born on December 1, 1946 in Istanbul, Hamarat attended the Austrian St. Georgs-Kolleg high school in Istanbul, and then graduated in Physics from the Middle East Technical University (ODT√ú) in Ankara. In 1972, he moved to Vienna, Austria for his Master's degree in Physics Engineering at the Vienna University of Technology there. In 1976, he went temporarily back to ƒ∞zmir, Turkey for military service. Since 1972 he has been living in Austria and has been an Austrian citizen since 1994. Recently, he is working for a telecommunication company in Vienna. During the sixteenth ICCF World Championship, he had amassed an unassailable 11 points out of 15 games with one game remaining. Hamarat was deadly on the black side of the Sicilian Sveshnikov, beating former CC World Champion Horst Rittner of Germany and Greek International Master Spyros Kofidis with it. At one time, Hamarat was supposed not to have lost a single game as White in over 40 years. However, this retroactively ceased to be the case, as correspondence chess games date from their year of initiation, and Hamarat eventually lost games playing with the white pieces against Edgar Prang (started in 2001) and Hans Marcus Elwert (started in 2002), though he apparently resigned these only after he became World Champion in January 2004. In 'over-the-board' chess, he played in the finals of the Turkish championships three times. In Vienna, he played in the top league. But since 1963 his main interest has been correspondence chess, \\"because I am a perfectionist\\", he says. In 1997, he earned the title of International Grandmaster of Correspondence Chess. Hamarat also plays backgammon professionally. He is one of the top players in Austria. He won several titles in international backgammon tournaments. Besides, he is also an expert in jazz music, and acts as a jazz DJ in Vienna. The Austrian mail authority issued a personified postage stamp with his picture in his honor.

Peel's life Caldbeck cottages, home of the huntsman John Peel. Caldbeck was a stopping place for travellers to whom the monks provided hospitality. St Kentigern's Church, Caldbeck, Wigton, Cumbria, UK Peel was born at Park End, near Caldbeck, Cumberland; his family moved a short time after to the Greenrigg farm. He was baptised on 24 September 1777, but most sources suggest he was born the previous year. Peel married in 1797 to Mary White. Some of the White family's property at Ruthwaite (near Ireby) passed into his hands, which secured Peel a comfortable income. However, he was, as many of his friends admitted, prone to dissipation and he devoted himself primarily to hunting. Peel was a farmer by profession, and kept a pack of fox hounds. Peel hunted pine martens and hares in addition to foxes. By the end of his life (13 November 1854, most likely due to a fall while hunting) he had accrued large debts, which his friends helped him pay off. John Peel did occasionally ride to hounds, his mount being a 14 hand dun crossbred gelding named 'Dunny'. 'Dunny' would often be abandoned for hours during the hunt when the going became too rough to ride over, standing patiently waiting for his master to return. Peel's niece Nancy Wilson (who was brought up in the Peel household) was also known to hunt with her Uncle John on horseback, 'mounted on a grey pony and garbed in a green habit', meaning she rode sidesaddle, which was the proper custom for ladies at the time. But Peel did on many occasions follow the old Cumberland custom, known as 'Chasing the Ace', chasing after the hounds on foot. Peel became a moderately well-known figure, owing to the song written about him. Some of the local gentry, after his death, were glad to take on his sons as servants, and the story of Peel romanticized hunting activities for many. He died in 1854 and is buried in the churchyard of St Kentigern's Church, Caldbeck. In 1977 his grave was vandalised by anti-hunting activists. Peel Region, the equivalent of a county in Ontario, Canada may be named after him. It is believed that three inns were named after his hounds, Hark to Towler at Heywood, Hark to Bounty at Slaidburn, and the Hark to Bellman Clitheroe. Residents now passed of the area have always understood that John Peel hunted in the Clitheroe district, later arriving by train to Chatburn station, with hounds and horses, and from there to the Bellman Inn (less than 1/2 mile) for a tot of whisky before going hunting.

The Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Holy Children () is a lengthy passage that appears after Daniel 3:23 in some translations of the Bible, including the ancient Greek Septuagint translation. It is accepted as canonical scripture by Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians, but rejected by Protestants. (Catholics and Orthodox refer to books in their canons that are rejected by Protestants as \\"deuterocanonical\\" and refer to texts accepted by Protestants as \\"protocanonical\\"; but for Catholics and Orthodox, both sets are equally authoritative.) Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England has it listed as non-canonical (but still, with the other Apocryphal texts, \\"the Church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners\\", and the Anglican Church uses it liturgically). The passage is omitted from most Protestant Bibles as an apocryphal addition. The passage includes three main components. The first is the penitential prayer of Daniel's friend Azariah (called Abednego in Babylonian, according to ) while the three youths were in the fiery furnace. The second component is a brief account of a radiant figure who met them in the furnace yet who was unburned. The third component is the hymn of praise they sang when they realized their deliverance. The hymn includes the refrain, \\"Praise and exalt Him above all forever...\\", repeated many times, each naming a feature of the world. The \\"Song of the Three Holy Youths\\" is part of the hymn called a canon sung during the Matins and other services in Orthodoxy. It can be found in the Church of England Book of Common Prayer as the canticle called the Benedicite and is one of the traditional canticles that can follow the first scripture lesson in the Order of Morning Prayer. It is also an optional song for Matins in Lutheran liturgies, and either an abbreviated or full version of the Song is featured as the Old Testament Canticle in the Lauds liturgy for Sundays and Feasts in the Divine Office of the Catholic Church. Texts and origin The Prayer and accompanying Song are not found in the Hebrew and Aramaic text of the Book of Daniel, nor are they cited in any extant early Jewish writings. However, the passage does appear in certain ancient translations, notably the Greek, Syriac, and Latin versions. At the end of the 19th century, M. Gaster identified what appears to be an Aramaic original of the song and another, Bel and Draco, also missing from the canonical book of Daniel. The Aramaic text is part of a collection of ancient Jewish texts compiled by a rabbi of about 14th century, and it is known under the name of The Chronicles of Jerachmeel. The origins of these writings are obscure. Whether the accounts were originally composed in Hebrew (or Aramaic) or in Greek is uncertain, although many modern scholars conclude on the basis of textual evidence that there was probably an original Semitic edition. The date of composition of these documents is also uncertain, although many scholars favor a date either in the second or first century B.C.

The specific epithet commemorates the American ornithologist Andrew Jackson Grayson. Mimus graysoni shows its close relationship to the northern and tropical mockingbirds rather subtly. It is a much stouter bird, resembling some thrashers in habitus. It also has a distinct juvenile plumage, more rufous above and has a heavy pattern, especially below. This uncannily resembles, e.g., the gray thrasher (Toxostoma cinereum) from Baja California, but is apparently a case of convergent evolution. Systematics and taxonomy This is a rather distinct Mimus mockingbird and was for some time placed into a distinct genus, Mimodes. This was revealed to be incorrect based on analysis of mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequences. Rather, the present species is closely related to the northern and tropical mockingbirds. Its distinctiveness is the result of the strong selective pressure on its island home, which enforced the evolution of conspicuous adaptational autapomorphies. The juvenile plumage might also have been the result of genetic drift enforced maybe by resource partitioning in this aggressive bird. The standard model of molecular clocks cannot be applied for mimids as their rates of mutation seem to vary much over time. While it is the most phenotypically distinctive bird on Socorro, it also has the strongest ecological change from its ancestors; therefore its distinctiveness is not informative except supporting the theory that it is one of the older Socorro endemics. Thus, and because the adaptation to the peculiar conditions on Socorro may even have accelerated not only morphological but also molecular evolution ‚Äì see also founder effect -, it cannot be said with any certainty whether or not among Mimus, the Socorro species is a quite recent island offshoot of either of the mainland species. In any case, the three taxa are very close relatives. This serves to show that evolution does not move on at a constant speed; certainly not on a morphological level, and often neither on a molecular level either. Rather, the rate of evolutionary change varies, sometimes considerably, depending on the circumstances and the strength with which natural selection acts upon a founding population. Ecology and status The Socorro mockingbird today lives mainly in unmodified low forest above 600 m (2000 ft), where it prefers groves of Oreopanax xalapensis and the endemic Guettarda insularis, with an understorey dominated by Triumfetta socorrensis and the endemic Eupatorium pacificum. As late as March 1953 it was still \\"common\\" at lower elevations, foraging in arid open areas of the Croton masonii-prickly pearProbably Engelmann's Prickly Pear (Opuntia engelmannii): Brattstrom & Howell (1956) shrubland. In November of the same year, the birds had retired to the more humid forest in the uplands and were busy singing and defending territories. Today, they mainly remain in Ficus cotinifolia stands when visiting the lower elevations. The breeding season is extended, with nests in attendance between November and July, with the peak laying occurring in March and April. Three eggs are laid, which take no more 15 days to hatch. The birds are generally reluctant to fly and as late as the mid-20th century were still fatally unwary; if pressed they will rather hop away than fly and if they take wing, it is usually for a few meters only. This may be an adaptation to the fact that Socorro has no native terrestrial predators, but red-tailed hawks and great frigatebirds that not infrequently prey on mockingbird-sized birds. This species feeds on small invertebrates, the remains of land crabs (Gecarcinus planatus) and fruit, namely of the endemic shrubs Ilex socorrensis and Sideroxylon socorrense, the latter of which has also become rare. Flies are pecked up but do not seem to be snatched out of the air. Like many Mimidae, the Socorro mockingbird is an aggressive, solitary species living alone or with its partner. When they come together at a plentiful food source ‚Äì e.g. blowflies on a carcass ‚Äì there is a marked social hierarchy between birds and rarely are more than two or three actively feeding; the less dominant birds hang around nearby, waiting for their turn. The call is two medium followed by one lower whistle. Less often, a full song is given, consisting of a variable warbling tune, repeated several times as in many mockingbirds. It is not clear whether this species imitates other birds like its relatives do; in any case only the Socorro tropical parula, Socorro towhee and Socorro wren would seem to possess songs that might serve as models for the mockingbirds, and except the parula these are not often found in the mockingbird's core habitat. =Status and conservation= This species numbers fewer than 400 individuals altogether and is considered Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Mimus graysoni is mostly threatened by habitat loss caused by feral sheep and the locust Schistocerca piceifrons, and predation by feral cats which became established after 1953, probably in the early 1970s. It is not believed that the northern mockingbird which has colonized Socorro in the late 20th century is limiting the recovery of its relative; the two Mimus do not occupy the same habitat and even if they did, the native bird is larger and more powerful and would probably simply outcompete its mainland relative in native vegetation at least. The extermination of the sheep is underway in the hope of restoring the island ecosystem. On one hand, it seems that the Socorro mockingbird is a prolific species and would be able to increase in numbers quickly if habitat improves. On the other hand, its terrestrial habits make it vulnerable to cat predation and this may limit its recovery even if sheep are contained; it is not known for example in how far foraging in the lowlands ‚Äì now cat-ridden ‚Äì was important for robust breeding success. In addition, it can be expected that predation on this species by both the native red-tailed hawk as well as the feral cats has increased since the Socorro dove ‚Äì formerly a preferred prey item ‚Äì has become extinct in the wild. Cerro Evermann, Socorro's main volcano, is still active and erupts on a limited scale every few decades; as the mockingbirds seem to depend on upland forest habitat, a major eruption could place the species in jeopardy (see also San Benedicto rock wren). This threat is not considered significant compared to the problem of introduced species however. Notes References External links *BirdLife Species Factsheet.

In contrast, induction is reasoning from observed training cases to general rules, which are then applied to the test cases. The distinction is most interesting in cases where the predictions of the transductive model are not achievable by any inductive model. Note that this is caused by transductive inference on different test sets producing mutually inconsistent predictions. Transduction was introduced by Vladimir Vapnik in the 1990s, motivated by his view that transduction is preferable to induction since, according to him, induction requires solving a more general problem (inferring a function) before solving a more specific problem (computing outputs for new cases): \\"When solving a problem of interest, do not solve a more general problem as an intermediate step. Try to get the answer that you really need but not a more general one.\\" A similar observation had been made earlier by Bertrand Russell: \\"we shall reach the conclusion that Socrates is mortal with a greater approach to certainty if we make our argument purely inductive than if we go by way of 'all men are mortal' and then use deduction\\" (Russell 1912, chap VII). An example of learning which is not inductive would be in the case of binary classification, where the inputs tend to cluster in two groups. A large set of test inputs may help in finding the clusters, thus providing useful information about the classification labels. The same predictions would not be obtainable from a model which induces a function based only on the training cases. Some people may call this an example of the closely related semi-supervised learning, since Vapnik's motivation is quite different. An example of an algorithm in this category is the Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM). A third possible motivation which leads to transduction arises through the need to approximate. If exact inference is computationally prohibitive, one may at least try to make sure that the approximations are good at the test inputs. In this case, the test inputs could come from an arbitrary distribution (not necessarily related to the distribution of the training inputs), which wouldn't be allowed in semi- supervised learning. An example of an algorithm falling in this category is the Bayesian Committee Machine (BCM). Example problem The following example problem contrasts some of the unique properties of transduction against induction. File:labels.png A collection of points is given, such that some of the points are labeled (A, B, or C), but most of the points are unlabeled (?). The goal is to predict appropriate labels for all of the unlabeled points. The inductive approach to solving this problem is to use the labeled points to train a supervised learning algorithm, and then have it predict labels for all of the unlabeled points. With this problem, however, the supervised learning algorithm will only have five labeled points to use as a basis for building a predictive model. It will certainly struggle to build a model that captures the structure of this data. For example, if a nearest- neighbor algorithm is used, then the points near the middle will be labeled \\"A\\" or \\"C\\", even though it is apparent that they belong to the same cluster as the point labeled \\"B\\". Transduction has the advantage of being able to consider all of the points, not just the labeled points, while performing the labeling task. In this case, transductive algorithms would label the unlabeled points according to the clusters to which they naturally belong. The points in the middle, therefore, would most likely be labeled \\"B\\", because they are packed very close to that cluster. An advantage of transduction is that it may be able to make better predictions with fewer labeled points, because it uses the natural breaks found in the unlabeled points. One disadvantage of transduction is that it builds no predictive model. If a previously unknown point is added to the set, the entire transductive algorithm would need to be repeated with all of the points in order to predict a label. This can be computationally expensive if the data is made available incrementally in a stream. Further, this might cause the predictions of some of the old points to change (which may be good or bad, depending on the application). A supervised learning algorithm, on the other hand, can label new points instantly, with very little computational cost. Transduction algorithms Transduction algorithms can be broadly divided into two categories: those that seek to assign discrete labels to unlabeled points, and those that seek to regress continuous labels for unlabeled points. Algorithms that seek to predict discrete labels tend to be derived by adding partial supervision to a clustering algorithm. These can be further subdivided into two categories: those that cluster by partitioning, and those that cluster by agglomerating. Algorithms that seek to predict continuous labels tend to be derived by adding partial supervision to a manifold learning algorithm. =Partitioning transduction= Partitioning transduction can be thought of as top-down transduction. It is a semi-supervised extension of partition-based clustering. It is typically performed as follows: Consider the set of all points to be one large partition. While any partition P contains two points with conflicting labels: Partition P into smaller partitions. For each partition P: Assign the same label to all of the points in P. Of course, any reasonable partitioning technique could be used with this algorithm. Max flow min cut partitioning schemes are very popular for this purpose. =Agglomerative transduction= Agglomerative transduction can be thought of as bottom-up transduction. It is a semi-supervised extension of agglomerative clustering. It is typically performed as follows: Compute the pair-wise distances, D, between all the points. Sort D in ascending order. Consider each point to be a cluster of size 1. For each pair of points {a,b} in D: If (a is unlabeled) or (b is unlabeled) or (a and b have the same label) Merge the two clusters that contain a and b. Label all points in the merged cluster with the same label. =Manifold transduction= Manifold-learning-based transduction is still a very young field of research. See also * Epilogism References * V.

His novel The Way West won the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and his screenplay for Shane (1953) was nominated for an Academy Award. Biography Guthrie was born in 1901 in Bedford, Indiana. When he was six months old he relocated with his parents to Montana, where his father became the first principal of the Teton County Free High School in Choteau. His father was a graduate of Indiana University, his mother from Earlham College at Richmond, Indiana. A constant reader, Guthrie tried to write while in high school, \\"fiction pretty much, some essays, but I majored in journalism. My father had been a newspaper man for four years in this little town in Kentucky, and I guess he thought it was the way to become a writer\\". In 1919, Guthrie entered the University of Washington, then transferred to the University of Montana, where he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity and graduated with honors in 1923. He worked odd jobs for the next few years. In 1926, Guthrie took out a $300 bank loan and moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where he took a job at the Lexington Leader newspaper. For the next 21 years he worked as a reporter, the city editor, and an editorial writer for the Leader. Guthrie published his first novel Murders at Moon Dance in 1943. In 1944, while still at the Leader, Guthrie won the Nieman Fellowship from Harvard, and spent the year at the university studying writing. While at Harvard he made friends with English professor Theodore Morrison, \\"who knew so much about writing, probably more than I ever will.\\" Morrison mentored Guthrie and helped him transition from journalism to fiction. During his year at Harvard Guthrie began his novel The Big Sky, which was published in 1947. Guthrie later wrote, \\"It wasn't until I went to Harvard that I got in gear. Then I went back and worked for the newspaper for another year or so.\\" At the Lexington Leader Guthrie's boss was very understanding and as long as Guthrie performed his news duties satisfactorily he was allowed to take his afternoons off to write fiction. After publication of The Big Sky Guthrie left the paper and supported himself by teaching creative writing at University of Kentucky. During this time he published The Way West which won the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. He quit teaching in 1952 to devote his full-time to writing, and moved back to Choteau, Montana, because he said it was his \\"point of outlook on the universe\\". He split his residence between Choteau and Great Falls, Montana, an hour away from Choteau. Guthrie continued to write predominantly western subjects. He worked for a time in Hollywood, writing the screenplays for Shane (1953, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award) and The Kentuckian (1955). His other books included These Thousand Hills (1956), The Blue Hen's Chick (1965), Arfive (1970), The Last Valley (1975), Fair Land, Fair Land (1982), Murder in the Cotswolds (1989), and A Field Guide to Writing Fiction (1991). His first collection of short stories, The Big It and Other Stories, was published in 1960. Guthrie died in 1991, at age 90, at his ranch near Choteau.

He wrote more than 30 novels, several set during the American Civil War, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1956 for his 1955 novel, Andersonville. He also wrote the novel Gettysburg, set during the Civil War. Early life and education Kantor was born and grew up in Webster City, Iowa, the second child and only son in his family. He had a sister, Virginia. His mother, Effie (McKinlay) Kantor, worked as the editor of the Webster City Daily News during part of his childhood. His father, John Martin Kantor, was a native-born Swedish Jew descended from \\"a long line of rabbis, who posed as a Protestant clergyman\\". His mother was of English, Irish, Scottish, and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. (Later, MacKinlay Kantor wrote an unpublished novel called Half Jew.) republished on Mystery File Kantor's father had trouble keeping jobs and abandoned the family before Kantor was born. His mother returned to her parents in Webster City, Mr. and Mrs. Adam McKinlay, to live at their home with her children. As a child, the boy started using his middle name McKinlay as his given name. He changed its spelling, adding an \\"a\\", because he thought it sounded more Scottish, and chose to be called \\"Mack\\" or MacKinlay. He attended the local schools and described the Kendall Young Public Library as his \\"university\\". Kantor won a writing contest with his first story, \\"Purple\\". Marriage and family Kantor married Florence Irene Layne, and they had two children together. Their son Tim Kantor wrote a memoir of his father, titled My Father's Voice: MacKinlay Kantor Long Remembered (1988). His grandson, Tom Shroder wrote a biography of his grandfather titled, The Most Famous Writer Who Ever Lived: A True Story of My Family. (Blue Rider Press, 2016) Career =Stories, journalism, and novels= From 1928 to 1934, Kantor wrote numerous stories for pulp fiction magazines, to earn a living and support his family; these works included crime stories and mysteries. He sold his first pulp stories, \\"Delivery Not Received\\" and \\"A Bad Night for Benny\\", to Edwin Baird, editor of Real Detective Tales and Mystery Stories. He also wrote for Detective Fiction Weekly. In 1928, Kantor published his first novel, Diversey, set in Chicago, Illinois. In 1932, Kantor moved with his family from the Midwest to New Jersey, in the New York metropolitan area. He was an early resident of Free Acres, a social experimental community developed by activist Bolton Hall in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. \\"Free Acres had some famous residents in those heady early days: actors James Cagney and Jersey City‚Äìborn Victor Kilian, writers Thorne Smith (Topper) and MacKinlay Kantor (Andersonville), and anarchist Harry Kelly, who helped found the Ferrer Modern School, centerpiece of the anarchist colony at Stelton in present-day Piscataway.\\" In two years, he sold 16 short stories and a serialized novel to Howard Bloomfield, editor of Detective Fiction Weekly. He also acquired a professional agent, Sydney Sanders. Achieving some success by 1934, Kantor began to submit short stories to the \\"slick magazines\\" (glossies). His \\"Rogue's Gallery\\", published in Collier on August 24, 1935, became his most frequently reprinted story. It was during this decade that Kantor first wrote about the American Civil War, beginning with his novel Long Remember (1934), set at the Battle of Gettysburg. As a boy and teenager in Iowa, Kantor had spent hours listening to the stories of Civil War veterans, and he was an avid collector of first-hand narratives. His work was also part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics. During World War II, Kantor reported from London as a war correspondent for a Los Angeles newspaper. After flying with some bombing missions, he asked for and received training to operate the bomber's turret machine guns, although he was not in service and this violated regulations. Kantor interviewed numerous wounded troops, whose thoughts and ideas inspired a later novel of his. When Kantor interviewed U.S. troops, many told him the only goal was to get home alive. He was reminded of the Protestant hymn: \\"When all my labors and trials are o'er / And I am safe on that beautiful shore [Heaven], O that will be / Glory for me!\\" Kantor returned from the European theater of war on military air transport (MAT). After the war, the producer Samuel Goldwyn commissioned him to write a screenplay about veterans' returning home. No online access. Kantor wrote a novel in blank verse, which was published as Glory for Me (1945). After selling the movie rights to his novel, Kantor was disappointed that the film was released under the title The Best Years of Our Lives (1946), and that details of the story had been changed by the screenwriter Robert Sherwood. Kantor was said to have lost his temper with Goldwyn and walked off the Hollywood lot. The first 15 seconds of the movie note that it is \\"based upon a novel by MacKinlay Kantor\\", but the novel's title was not given. The film was a commercial and critical success, winning seven Academy Awards. Beginning in 1948, Kantor arranged an intensive period of research with the New York City Police Department (NYCPD). He was the only civilian other than reporters allowed to ride with police on their beat. He often rode on night shifts, working with the 23rd Precinct, whose territory ranged from upper Park Avenue to East Harlem, comprising a wide range of residents and incomes. These experiences informed most of his short crime novels, as well as his major work Signal Thirty-Two, published in 1950 with jacket art by his wife Irene Layne Kantor. Also in 1950 Kantor took up research into the post-war life of a war widow. In discussions with the chaplain at Mitchel Field, Kantor was referred to Margaret Stavish of Bellmore, NY, who had lost her B-24 pilot husband, Edward Dobson, KIA on November 18, 1943, and in 1947 married John Stavish, a veteran of the Pacific theater. Kantor then published their story, \\"V-J Day Plus Five Years,\\" in the August 1950 issue of Redbook Magazine. And see: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JE_Hill_Crew_plaque_photo.jpg Kantor was noted for his limited use of punctuation within his literary compositions. He was known for a lack of quotation marks and was influential in this regard on Cormac McCarthy, who said that Kantor was the first writer he encountered who left them out. Kantor was one of three primary influences on McCarthy's adopting his unique style. During his assignment with the U.S. troops in World War II, Kantor entered the Buchenwald concentration camp as they liberated it on April 14, 1945. During the next decade, that experience informed his research for and writing of Andersonville (1955), his novel about the Confederate prisoner of war camp. One of the problems he struggled with in Germany and afterward was how to think of the civilians who lived near Buchenwald. As he struggled to understand, he developed ideas which he expressed in his novel, where he portrayed some civilian Southerners sympathetically, in contrast to officers at the camp. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1956 for Andersonville (1955). In writing more than 30 novels, Kantor often returned to the theme of the American Civil War. He wrote two works for young readers set in the Civil War years: Lee and Grant at Appomattox (1950) and Gettysburg (1952). In the November 22, 1960, issue of Look magazine, Kantor published a fictional account set as a history text, entitled If the South Had Won the Civil War. This generated such a response that it was published in 1961 as a book. It is one of many alternate histories of that war. Kantor's last novel was Valley Forge (1975). =Films= In addition to journalism and novels, several of his novels were adapted for films by other writers. Kantor was credited as writing the screenplay for Gun Crazy (aka Deadly Is the Female) (1950), a film noir. It was based on his short story by the same name, published February 3, 1940, in The Saturday Evening Post. However, in 1992, it was revealed that Dalton Trumbo had written the Gun Crazy screenplay, as Trumbo, one of the Hollywood Ten, had been blacklisted as a result of his refusal to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings. Kantor passed his payment on to Trumbo to help him survive. Kantor acted in the film Wind Across the Everglades (1958). The film Follow Me Boys! (1966) was based on his novel God and My Country. =Publishing= He established his own publishing house, and published several of his works in the 1930s and 1940s. Death Kantor died of a heart attack in 1977, aged 73, at his home in Sarasota, Florida.

Tax-exempt status may provide complete relief from taxes, reduced rates, or tax on only a portion of items. Examples include exemption of charitable organizations from property taxes and income taxes, veterans, and certain cross-border or multi-jurisdictional scenarios. Tax exemption generally refers to a statutory exception to a general rule rather than the mere absence of taxation in particular circumstances, otherwise known as an exclusion. Tax exemption also refers to removal from taxation of a particular item rather than a deduction. International duty free shopping may be termed \\"tax-free shopping\\". In tax-free shopping, the goods are permanently taken outside the jurisdiction, thus paying taxes is not necessary. Tax-free shopping is also found in ships, airplanes and other vessels traveling between countries (or tax areas). Tax-free shopping is usually available in dedicated duty-free shops. However, any transaction may be duty-free, given that the goods are presented to the customs when exiting the country. In such a scenario, a sum equivalent to the tax is paid, but reimbursed on exit. More common in Europe, tax-free is less frequent in the United States, with the exception of Louisiana. However, current European Union rules prohibit most intra-EU tax-free trade, with the exception of certain special territories outside the tax area. Specific monetary exemptions Some jurisdictions allow for a specific monetary reduction of the tax base, which may be referred to as an exemption. For example, the U.S. Federal and many state tax systems allow a deduction of a specified dollar amount for each of several categories of \\"personal exemptions\\". Similar amounts may be called \\"personal allowances\\". Some systems may provide thresholds at which such exemptions or allowances are phased out or removed.26 USC 151, Allowance of deductions for personal exemptions. The amount per exemption is $3,650, subject to phase-out. UK tax free personal allowances vary. Exempt organizations  Some governments grant broad exclusions from all taxation for certain types of organization. The exclusions may be restricted to entities having various characteristics. The exclusions may be inherent in definitions or restrictions outside the tax law itself.As an example, UK charities law defines the types of organizations which may qualify as registered charities, and places limits on their actions. =Approaches for exemption= There are several different approaches used in granting exemption to organizations. Different approaches may be used within a jurisdiction or especially within sub-jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions grant an overall exemption from taxation to organizations meeting certain definitions. The United Kingdom, for example, provides an exemption from rates (property taxes), and income taxes for entities governed by the Charities Law. This overall exemption may be somewhat limited by limited scope for taxation by the jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions may levy only a single type of tax, exemption from only a particular tax. Some jurisdictions provide for exemption only from certain taxes. The United States exempts certain organizations from Federal income taxes,26 USC 501(a). The exemption from Federal income tax is longstanding. This exemption formed part of the Revenue Act of 1894. The 1894 Act was the first broadly applicable U.S. tax on corporate income, but was soon declared unconstitutional. Since ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, the exemption for charitable, religious, and educational organizations has been included in all subsequent Federal income tax law. See Belknap, Chauncey, \\"The Federal Income Tax Exemption of Charitable Organizations: Its History and Underlying Policy,\\" 1954, reprinted (very large file) as pages 2025-2043 of the Research Papers of the Commission on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs, Volume IV, 1977. but not from various excise or most employment taxes.26 USC Subtitle D excise taxes are imposed on particular goods or services, generally without exemptions. Certain of these taxes apply primarily to tax exempt organizations. See, e.g., 26 USC 4911, tax on excess expenditures to influence legislation. 26 USC 3101 and 3301 generally impose social security and unemployment taxes on all organizations. Note that income from certain types of services, such as services as a minister, may be exempt from the definition of income for these taxes. Employees of certain nonprofit and governmental organizations are eligible to participate in different sorts of deferred compensation plans than employees of other organizations. Compare 26 USC 401, IRS Publication 560 and others vs. 26 USC 403(b), IRS Publication 571. =Charitable and religious organizations = Many tax systems provide complete exemption from tax for recognized charitable organizations. Such organizations may include religious organizations (temples, mosques, churches, etc.), fraternal organizations (including social clubs), public charities (e.g., organizations serving homeless persons), or any of a broad variety of organizations considered to serve public purposes. The U.S. system exempts from Federal and many state income taxesNote that under the U.S. system each state is entitled to raise its own taxes. 43 of the states impose a [state income tax]. Some states incorporate or make reference to Federal definitions for parts of their tax laws. See, e.g.,. the income of organizations that have qualified for such exemption. Qualification requires that the organization be created and operated for one of a long list of tax exempt purposes,26 USC 501(c) which includes more than 28 types of organizations and also requires, for most types of organizations, that the organization apply for tax exempt status with the Internal Revenue Service,26 CFR 1.501(a)-1(a)(2). or be a religious or apostolic organization.26 USC 501(d).See IRS Publication 557. Note that the U.S. system does not distinguish between various kinds of tax exempt entities (such as educational versus charitable) for purposes of granting exemption, but does make such distinctions with respect to allowing a tax deduction for contributions.Tax exempt entities with gross receipts over US$25,000 are required to file annual tax returns on Form 990. Those with less than $25,000 must file a simplified return. The IRS granted an extension of time for such organizations to file for 2009 until October 15, 2010. Charities falling under that revenue threshold have had no regular filing mandate in the past. One list of small organizations is at http://www.501exempt.com. In November 2017, the GOP released a tax bill that would allow churches to keep their tax exemptions even if they endorse political candidates. The UK generally exempts public charities from business rates, corporation tax, income tax, and certain other taxes.For a discussion of UK taxation of charities, see the 1999 Review of Charity Taxation Consultation Document. =Governmental entities = Most systems exempt internal governmental units from all tax. For multi-tier jurisdictions, this exemption generally extends to lower tier units and across units. For example, state and local governments are not subject to Federal, state, or local income taxes in the U.S.26 USC 115 specifically excludes from taxable income all income of states or municipalities, as well as income of public utilities. This operates as an exemption from tax for state and municipal governments. =Pension schemes= Most systems do not tax entities organized to conduct retirement investment and pension activities for employees of one or more employers or for the benefit of employees.Examples include: a) The United States taxes beneficiaries of trusts, not trusts (with exceptions), but exempts under 26 USC 402 beneficiaries of a pension trust meeting certain qualification; b) Canada ; c) The United Kingdom exempts income and gains of a registered pension scheme from taxation under Income Tax Act section 186, as discussed in the Registered Pension Scheme Manual. In addition, many systems also provide tax exemption for personal pension schemes.See, e.g., 26 USC 409 providing exemption to owners of Individual Retirement Accounts until funds are distributed. =Educational institutions= Some jurisdictions provide separate total or partial tax exemptions for educational institutions.See, e.g., Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education chart of exemptions and benefits for private higher education institutions. These exemptions may be limited to certain functions or income. =Other not-for-profit entities= Some jurisdictions provide tax exemption for other particular types of organizations not meeting any of the above categories. =Reciprocal exemptions= Some jurisdictions allow tax exemption for organizations exempt from tax in certain other jurisdictions. For example, most U.S. states allow tax exemption for organizations recognized for Federal tax purposes as tax exempt. =Sales tax= Most states and localities imposing sales and use taxes in the United States exempt resellers from sales taxes on goods held for sale and ultimately sold. In addition, most such states and localities exempt from sales taxes goods used directly in the production of other goods (i.e., raw materials). :See also Sales taxes in the United States, tax-free shopping, tax holiday. Exempt individuals  Certain classes of persons may be granted a full or partial tax exemption within a system. Common exemptions are for veterans,See, e.g., New York City's veterans property tax exemption. clergymenSee, e.g., [26 USC 107] which excludes from income the rental value of a parsonage provided by a church to a clergyman. or taxpayers with children (who can take \\"dependency exemption\\" for each qualifying dependent who has lived with the taxpayer. The dependent can be a natural child, step-child, step-sibling, half-sibling, adopted child, eligible foster child, or grandchild, and is usually under age 19, a full-time student under age 24, or have special needs).Presti and Naegele Newsletter, February , 2012. The exemption granted may depend on multiple criteria, including criteria otherwise unrelated to the particular tax. For example, a property tax exemption may be provided to certain classes of veterans earning less than a particular income level.See the New York City rule cited above. Definitions of exempt individuals tend to be complex. In in the Hebrew Bible, King Saul includes tax exemption as one of the rewards on offer to whoever comes forward to defeat the Philistine giant Goliath. In the Ottoman Empire, tax breaks for descendents of Muhammad encouraged many people to buy certificates of descent or forge genealogies; the phenomenon of teseyy√ºd ‚Äì falsely claiming noble ancestry ‚Äì spread across ethnic, class, and religious boundaries. In the 17th century, an Ottoman bureaucrat estimated that there were 300,000 impostors; In 18th-century Anatolia, nearly all upper-class urban people claimed descent from Muhammad. The number of people claiming such ancestry ‚Äì which exempted them from taxes such as avarƒ±z and tekalif-i orfiye ‚Äì became so great that tax collection was very difficult. Exempt income  Most income tax systems exclude certain classes of income from the taxable income base. Such exclusions may be referred to as exclusions or exemptions. Systems vary highly.Contrast 26 USC 101-140 exclusions from gross income to UK non-taxable income. Among the more commonly excluded items are: *Income earned outside the taxing jurisdiction.See International tax for a discussion of territorial tax systems. Most systems exclude from the tax base income of nonresidents from sources outside the taxing jurisdiction. U.S. states and Canadian provinces provide for formulary apportionment of certain business income to achieve a similar result. See, e.g., the Multi State Tax Compact, discussed in a note below. Such exclusions may be limited in amount.See, e.g., 26 USC 911, 912. *Interest income earned from subsidiary jurisdictions.See, e.g., 26 USC 103, excluding from U.S. Federal taxable income certain types of interest income received on bonds issued by states or political subdivisions thereof. *Income consisting of compensation for loss.See, e.g., 26 USC 104, excluding compensation for sickness or injury. *The value of property inherited or acquired by gift.The transfer of such property is often taxed separately to the transferor or the transferee. See Estate tax and Gift tax. Some tax systems specifically exclude from income items that the system is trying to encourage. Such exclusions or exemptions can be quite specificSee, e.g., 26 USC 131 relating to certain foster care payments. or very general. Among the types of income that may be included are classes of income earned in specific areas, such as special economic zones, enterprise zones, etc. These exemptions may be limited to specific industries. As an example, India provides SEZs where exporters of goods or providers of services to foreign customers may be exempt from income taxes and customs duties. Exempt property  Certain types of property are commonly granted exemption from property or transaction (such as sales or value added) taxes. These exemptions vary highly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and definitions of what property qualifies for exemption can be voluminous.See, e.g., the Texas Sales Tax rules, providing very specific lists of items that are exempt from sales tax. For shortened list of examples of such, see the Grocery and Convenience Stores flyer from the state. Among the more commonly granted exemptions are: *Property used in manufacture of other goods (which goods may ultimately be taxable) *Property used by a tax exempt or other parties for a charitable or other not for profit purpose *Property considered a necessity of life, often exempted from sales taxes in the United States *Personal residence of the taxpayer,See, e.g., the Homestead Exemption granted in Florida. often subject to specific monetary limitations Conditions imposed on exemptions  Exemption from tax often requires that certain conditions be met. Multi-tier jurisdictions Many countries that impose tax have subdivisions or subsidiary jurisdictions that also impose tax. This feature is not unique to federal systems, like the U.S., Switzerland and Australia, but rather is a common feature of national systems.See, e.g., Japan's prefecture taxes, UK local rates, etc.. The top tier system may impose restrictions on both the ability of the lower tier system to levy tax as well as how certain aspects of such lower tier system work, including the granting of tax exemptions. The restrictions may be imposed directly on the lower jurisdiction's power to levy tax or indirectly by regulating tax effects of the exemption at the upper tier. Cross-border agreements Jurisdictions may enter into agreements with other jurisdictions that provide for reciprocal tax exemption. Such provisions are common in an income tax treaty. These reciprocal tax exemptions typically call for each contracting jurisdiction to exempt certain income of a resident of the other contracting jurisdiction. Multi-jurisdictional agreements for tax exemption also exist. 20 of the U.S. states have entered into the Multistate Tax Compact that provides, among other things, that each member must grant a full credit for sales and use taxes paid to other states or subdivisions. The European Union members are all parties to the EU multi-country VAT harmonisation rules.

She graduated in 1950 Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. degree from Newcomb College, the women's coordinate college of Tulane University. Career Grau's first collection of stories The Black Prince was nominated for the National Book Award in 1956. Nine years later, her novel The Keepers of the House was awarded the 1965 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The night she was called about the Pulitzer Prize, she thought it was a practical joke from a friend whose voice she thought she recognized. \\"'I was awfully short-tempered that morning because I'd been up all night with one of my children,' Grau said ... 'So, I said to the voice I mistook, \\"yeah and I'm the Queen of England too,\\" and I hung up on him.'\\" The Pulitzer Prize committee member did not give up and called her publisher Alfred A. Knopf. \\"The news got to me, but that was very embarrassing.\\" Themes Grau's writing explores issues of death, destruction, abortion, and miscegenation, frequently set in historical Alabama or Louisiana. Although she does not restrict her writing to the Deep South or to stories about women, she is recognized as an important writer in the fields of women's studies, feminist literature, and Southern literature. Personal life Grau married James K. Feibleman, a fellow writer and a professor of philosophy at Tulane University, in 1955. The pair were introduced by Grau's friend who was also a student of Feibleman. She legally changed her surname to his, but retained her maiden name when writing. Together, they had four children‚Äîtwo sons (Ian and William) and two daughters (Nora and Katherine). The family settled in Metairie, on the outskirts of New Orleans, and they remained married until his death in 1987. Grau died on August 3, 2020, at a retirement home in Kenner, Louisiana. She was 91 and had suffered from complications of a stroke.

She also held the Duchy of Touraine (1547-1558) in dower. She is called \\"Leonor\\" in Spanish and Portuguese and \\"El√©onore\\" or \\"Ali√©nor\\" in French. Life Eleanor and her siblings Eleanor was born in 1498 at Leuven, the eldest child of Philip of Austria and Joanna of Castile, who would later become co-sovereigns of Castile. Her father was also the son of the reigning Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and his deceased consort Mary of Burgundy, while her mother was the daughter of the Catholic Monarchs; namely Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile. Her siblings were Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, Queen Isabella of Denmark, Queen Mary of Hungary and Queen Catherine of Portugal. She was named after her paternal great-grandmother, Eleanor of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress. When she was a child, Eleanor's relatives tried to marry her to the future King of England, Henry VIII, to whom she was betrothed. However, when Henry's father died and he became King, Henry decided to marry Eleanor's aunt, Catherine of Aragon, who was the widow of King Henry's older brother, Arthur, Prince of Wales. Her relatives also tried to marry her to the French Kings Louis XII or Francis I or to the Polish King Sigismund I, but nothing came of these plans. Eleanor was also proposed as a marriage candidate for Antoine, Duke of Lorraine, in 1510. In 1517 Eleanor may have had a love affair with Frederick II, Elector Palatine. Her brother King Charles, who had succeeded their elderly grandfather King Ferdinand as King of Spain the year before, once discovered her reading a love letter from Frederick. Charles forced Eleanor and Frederick to swear in front of an attorney that they were not secretly married, after which he expelled Frederick from court. She followed her brother to Spain in 1517. = Queen of Portugal = Eleanor married her uncle by marriage, King Manuel I of Portugal, after a proposed marriage with her cousin, the future King John III of Portugal, did not occur. Her brother Charles arranged the marriage between Eleanor and the King of Portugal to avoid the possibility of Portuguese assistance for any rebellion in Castile. Manuel had previously been married to two of Eleanor's maternal aunts, Isabella of Aragon and Maria of Aragon. Manuel and Eleanor married on 16 July 1518. They had two children: the Infante Charles (born 18 February 1520 ‚Äì died 15 April 1521) and the Infanta Maria (born 8 June 1521, and who was later one of the richest princesses of Europe). She became a widow on 13 December 1521, when Manuel died of the plague. As Queen Dowager of Portugal, Eleanor returned to the court of Charles in Spain. Eleanor's sister Catherine later married Eleanor's stepson, King John III of Portugal. In July 1523, Eleanor was engaged to Charles III, Duke of Bourbon, in an alliance between Charles and Bourbon against France, but the marriage never took place. In 1526, Eleanor was engaged to King Francis I of France during his captivity in Spain. = Queen of France = Eleanor of Austria coat of arms as queen of France. In 1529, by the treaty called \\"La Paz de las Damas\\" (The Ladies' Peace), it was stipulated that the marriage should take place. She was married to Francis on 4 July 1530. They had no children. Eleanor left Spain in the company of her future stepsons, who were now to be released having been held hostage by her brother. The group met Francis at the border, where Eleanor and Francis were married, and then departed for an official entrance to Bordeaux. Eleanor was crowned Queen of France in Saint-Denis on 31 May 1531. She was dressed in purple velvet at her coronation. Eleanor was ignored by Francis, who seldom performed his marital obligations and preferred his lover Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly. At the official entrance of Eleanor to Paris, Francis displayed himself openly to the public in a window with his lover Anne for a period of two hours. Queen Eleanor performed as the queen of France at official occasions, such as at the wedding between her stepson Henry and Catherine de' Medici in 1533. She also performed charity and was praised for this. She also took her stepdaughters, Madeleine and Margaret, into her household to raise them further. As the French queen, Eleanor did not have any political power; however, she was used as a contact between France and the Holy Roman Empire. Queen Eleanor was present at the peace negotiations between Francis and Charles in Aigues-Mortes in 1538. In 1544, she was given the task of entering peace negotiations with Charles and their sister Mary. In November 1544, she visited Charles in Brussels. =Later life= As a queen dowager, Eleanor left France for Brussels in 1548. She witnessed the abdication of Charles in October 1555 and left for Spain with him and their sister Mary in August 1556. She lived with her sister in Jarandilla de la Vera, where they often visited their brother, who retired to a monastery nearby. In 1558, she met her daughter Maria in Badajoz for the first time in 28 years. Eleanor died in 1558 on the return trip from Badajoz.

It was the more expensive and more popular version of the Pensie Pinkie (made by Penn Racquet Sports). These balls are commonly used in street games developed in the mid-20th century, such as Chinese handball (a variation on American handball), stoop ball, hit-the-penny (involving trying to make a penny flip on a sidewalk), butts up, handball, punchball, half-rubber, Wireball and stickball (variations of baseball). Name The term arose from a New York City- accented pronunciation of Spalding, the sporting goods company that produced the balls. The name has become so common that Spalding now uses it in marketing, and it is now a registered trademark. History Spaldeens were popular with children from the 1930s through to the 1970s. In urban areas sparse in grass, Spaldeens became integral to many street games due to their bounciness and light weight. Citing the declining popularity of stickball, Spalding took the ball off the market in 1979, but it returned in 1999 to much fanfare. Colors Since its return in 1999 Spaldeens have been manufactured in a variety of colors in addition to pink. Some of them are black, blue, green, orange, purple, red, and yellow.

The clevis is a U-shaped piece that has holes at the end of the prongs to accept the clevis pin. The clevis pin is similar to a bolt, but is either partially threaded or is unthreaded with a cross-hole for a split pin. The tang is a piece that fits in the space within the clevis and is held in place by the clevis pin. The combination of a simple clevis fitted with a pin is commonly called a shackle, although a clevis and pin is only one of the many forms a shackle may take. Clevises are used in a wide variety of fasteners used in farming equipment and sailboat rigging, as well as the automotive, aircraft and construction industries. They are also widely used to attach control surfaces and other accessories to servo controls in airworthy model aircraft. As a part of a fastener, a clevis provides a method of allowing rotation in some axes while restricting rotation in others. Clevis pin A moused shackle There are two main types of clevis pins: threaded and unthreaded. Unthreaded clevis pins have a domed head at one end and a cross-hole at the other end. A cotter pin (USA usage) or split pin is used to keep the clevis pin in place. Threaded clevis pins have a partially threaded shank on one end and a formed head on the other. The formed head has a lip, which acts as a stop when threading the pin into the shackle, and a flattened tab with a cross-hole. The flattened tab allows for easy installation of the pin and the cross-hole allows the pin to be moused. A bolt can function as a clevis pin, but a bolt is not intended to take the lateral stress that a clevis pin must handle. Normal bolts are manufactured to handle tension loads, whereas clevis pins and bolts are designed to withstand shearing forces. Clevis pins should be closely fitted to the holes in the clevis to limit wear and reduce the failure rate of either the pin or the clevis. Twist clevis An assortment of shackles, with twist clevises in the middle A twist shackle provides a loop at a right angle to the axis of rotation. Older farming implements intended to be pulled by a team of draft animals often require a twist shackle to be hitched. Clevis hanger Clevis hanger A clevis hanger consists of one U-shaped clevis and a second V-shaped clevis with a hole in a flattened section at the base of the V, joined together with a bolt or pin. Clevis hangers are used as a pipe attachment providing vertical adjustment for pipes.Pipe Supports - Glossary Terms Piping Technology and Products (retrieved February 2012) Clevis bracket A clevis bracket generally takes the form of a solid metal piece with a flat rectangular base, fitted with holes for bolts or machine screws, and two rounded wings in parallel forming a clevis. Commonly used in aircraft and cars, clevis brackets allow mounting of rods to flat surfaces. Clevis hook A clevis hook is a hook, with or without a snap lock, with a clevis and bolt or pin at the base. The clevis is used to fasten the hook to a bracket or chain. Clevis rod end A clevis rod end is a folded or machined piece formed into a clevis and fitted with a hole at its base to which a rod is attached. In machined pieces, the hole is most often threaded. Twin clevis A twin clevis is a solid piece with two clevises directly opposite one another, each fitted with a pin. Twin clevises are commonly used to join two lengths of chain.

She won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for The Collected Stories of Jean Stafford in 1970. Biography She was born in Covina, California, to Mary Ethel (McKillop) and John Richard Stafford, a Western pulp writer. As a youth Stafford attended the University of Colorado Boulder and, with friend James Robert Hightower, won a one-year fellowship to study philology at the University of Heidelberg from 1936 to 1937. Her first novel, Boston Adventure, was a best-seller, earning her national acclaim. She wrote two more novels in her career, but her greatest medium was the short story: her works were published in The New Yorker and various literary magazines. In 1955 she won first place in the O. Henry Awards for her story In the Zoo. For the academic year 1964‚Äì1965, she was a Fellow on the faculty at the Center for Advanced Studies of Wesleyan University.Wesleyan.edu Stafford's personal life was often marked by unhappiness. She was married three times. Her first marriage, to the brilliant but mentally unstable poet Robert Lowell, left her with lingering emotional and physical scars. She was seriously injured in an automobile accident with Lowell at the wheel, a trauma she described in one of her best-known stories, \\"The Interior Castle,\\" and the disfigurement she suffered as a result was a turning point in her life. A second marriage to Life magazine staff writer Oliver Jensen also ended in divorce. Stafford enjoyed a brief period of domestic happiness with her third husband, A. J. Liebling, a prominent writer for The New Yorker. After his death, she stopped writing fiction. Death and legacy For many years Stafford suffered from alcoholism, depression, and pulmonary disease. By age sixty-three she had almost stopped eating and died of cardiac arrest in White Plains, New York, in 1979. She was buried in Green River Cemetery, East Hampton, New York. Several biographies of Jean Stafford were written following her death, notably David Roberts' Jean Stafford: a Biography (1988), Charlotte Margolis Goodman's Jean Stafford: The Savage Heart (1990), and Ann Hulbert's The Interior Castle: The Art and Life of Jean Stafford (1992).

It was formerly recognized as the family Myrsinaceae, or the myrsine family, consisting of 35 genera and about 1000 species. It is widespread in temperate to tropical climates extending north to Europe, Siberia, Japan, Mexico, and Florida, and south to New Zealand, South America, and South Africa. Plants are mostly mesophytic trees and shrubs; a few are lianas or subherbaceous. Their leathery, evergreen leaves are simple and alternate, with smooth margins and without stipules. They are often dotted with glands and resinous cavities. The latter may take the form of secretory lines. The plants are mostly monoecious, but a few are dioecious. Their small flowers are arranged in racemose terminal clusters, or in the leaf axils. The flowers have four or five sepals and petals. The floral envelope (perianth) has a distinct calyx and corolla. The calyx is regular and polysepalous. The nonfleshy petals of the corolla are more or less united, closely overlapping. The four or five stamens are usually isomerous with the perianth. The carpel has one style and one stigma, with the ovary unilocular, superior or semi-inferior. The one-seeded, indehiscent fruit is a thin-fleshed berry or drupe. North American species are the marlberry (Ardisia escalloniodes) and the Florida rapanea (Rapanea punctata). Plants in the subfamily have few economic uses. A few genera, such as Ardisia, Cyclamen, Lysimachia, and Myrsine, are grown as ornamental plants, especially Ardisia crispa and Myrsine africana. One species, Ardisia japonica (Chinese: Á¥´ÈáëÁâõ; pinyin: z«êjƒ´n ni√∫), is one of the 50 fundamental herbs in traditional Chinese medicine.

Opdam was born in October 1916 in Surabaya, Dutch East Indies. In 1936, he moved to the Netherlands. There he studied medicine and married Arnolda van Eyl, a teacher's daughter. During his wife's vacation in 1951, Opdam had an affair with the couple's maid, Nellie. Mrs. Opdam found out, but being a devoted Catholic, there was never any question of a divorce. Instead, Nellie was sacked. This did not stop Opdam from continuing his affair with the girl. In 1952, Mrs. Opdam's health declined steadily until she died on 24 September. Doctor Opdam claimed it was a brain tumor, but the colleague who performed the post-mortem disagreed and gave the cause of death as 'unknown'. Police were called to the case and a second examination of the body revealed Mrs. Opdam's body contained prussic acid. Johannes Opdam was arrested. During his trial, he at one point even accused his mother-in-law of committing the murder. On June 8, 1954, Opdam was convicted to life in prison. In the prison in Leeuwarden Opdam continued his dirty affairs. There he met Arie Lodder, who was also convicted for killing his wife. They agreed upon writing notes confessing each other's murders, to be used when one of them would die. In February 1958, Arie Lodder was found dead in his cell, which was next to that of Doctor Opdam's. Lodder too had been poisoned with prussic acid and on his body a note was found that he had taken a medicine Doctor Opdam had given him. In the meanwhile, both Doctor Opdam and the prison director had received a letter from Lodder, claiming that it was Lodder who had killed Mrs. Opdam. Opdam had obtained the chemicals to poison Lodder from his cousin-in-law. It is also possible that Lodder's parents had the poison delivered to the prison in Leeuwarden, thinking it was a medicine for their son. The letters and the trick did not set Opdam free, however. On the contrary, in 1961, he was again convicted to life in prison, this time for the murder of Arie Lodder. He remains the only one in Dutch juridical history to have been convicted twice to life in prison for two different murders.  References  *J.H.H.

At the age of six, he discovered the law of attraction and repulsion by playing with magnets made of steel.Michael Angelo Gomez, Black Crescent: The Experience and Legacy of African Muslims in the Americas, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 311 This insight led to a plan to create new people. He \\"saw an unlike human being, made to attract others, who could, with the knowledge of tricks and lies, rule the original black man.\\" By the age of 18, he had exhausted all knowledge in the universities of Mecca. He then discovered that the \\"original black man\\" contained both a \\"black germ\\" and a \\"brown germ\\". With 59,999 followers, he went to an \\"isle in the Aegean Sea called Pelan\\", which Muhammad identifies with Patmos. Once there, he established a despotic regime and set about breeding out the black traits, killed all darker babies, and created a brown race after 200 years. Yakub died at the age of 152, but his followers carried on his work. After 600 years of this deliberate eugenics, the white race was created.Elijah Muhammad, Message to the Blackman in America (summarized here) and Yakub: The Father of Mankind. See also, Dorothy Blake Fardan, Yakub and the Origins of White Supremacy, Lushena Books, 2001 The brutal conditions of their creation determined the evil nature of the new race: \\"by lying to the black mother of the baby, this lie was born into the very nature of the white baby; and, murder for the black people was also born in them‚Äîor made by nature a liar and murderer\\". The new race traveled to Mecca where they caused so much trouble they were exiled to \\"West Asia (Europe), and stripped of everything but the language....Once there, they were roped in, to keep them out of Paradise....The soldiers patrolled the border armed with swords, to prevent the devils from crossing.\\" For many centuries they lived a barbaric life, surviving naked in caves and eating raw meat, but eventually they were drawn out of the caves by Moses who \\"taught them to wear clothes\\". Moses tried to civilize them, but eventually gave up and blew up 300 of the most troublesome of them with dynamite.Elijah Muhammad, Message to the Blackman in America, Elijah Muhammad Books, 1973, p. 120. However, they had learned to use \\"tricknology\\" to usurp power and enslave the black population, bringing the first slaves to America. According to The Autobiography of Malcolm X, all the races other than the black race were by-products of Yakub's (spelled Yacub in the biography) work, as the \\"red, yellow and brown\\" races were created during the \\"bleaching\\" process;Nelson, Alondra, \\"A Black Mass as Black Gothic: Myth and Biosacience in Black Cultural Nationalism\\" in Lisa Gail Collins, Margo Crawford, New Thoughts on the Black Arts Movement, Rutgers University Press, 2006, pp. 140‚Äì141. however, the \\"black race\\" included Asian peoples, considered to be shared ancestors of the Moors. \\"Whites\\" were defined as Europeans. Elijah Muhammad also asserted that some of the new white race \\"tried to graft themselves back into the black nation, but they had nothing to go by.\\" As a result, they became gorillas. \\"A few were lucky enough to make a start, and got as far as what you call the gorilla. In fact, all of the monkey family are from this 2,000 year history of the white race in Europe.\\" According to NOI doctrine, Yakub's progeny were destined to rule for 6,000 years before the original black peoples of the world regained dominance, a process that had begun in 1914.Abraham/Mr. Yakub, NOI.comRaelist Admissiom from ALLAH Messager Yakub and Jacob The name Ya\`qub (Yakub) is the Arabic variant of the name of the Biblical Patriarch known as Jacob in English language versions of the Bible, and as ' in Biblical Hebrew. Fard Muhammad's Yakub has some parallels to the Biblical Jacob's role as the father of the tribes of Israel. The idea that Jews were an \\"artificial race\\" created by interbreeding and dependent on \\"tricks and lies\\" already existed in anti- Semitic theories of the time.Linda L. Clark, Social Darwinism in France, University of Alabama Press, 1984, p. 150 The story of Yakub includes Jews as part of a wider artificially created \\"white\\" race.Colin Kidd, The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600‚Äì2000, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 268. The NOI's claim that Jacob altered the skin color of a specific group of humans through selective breeding is similar to a story in Genesis 30:37‚Äì43 where Jacob alters the fur color of the goats and sheep in his uncle Laban's flocks. This story could be the origin of the NOI's story of Yakub. One major difference is that while the NOI says that Yakub employed selective breeding, Jacob used sympathetic magic in the Old Testament. In speeches by Malcolm X, Yakub is identified completely with Jacob. Referring to the story of Jacob wrestling with the angel, Malcolm X states that Elijah Muhammad told him that \\"Jacob was Yacub, and the angel that Jacob wrestled with wasn't God, it was the government of the day\\". This was because Yakub was seeking funds for his expedition to Patmos, \\"so when it says Jacob wrestled with an angel, 'angel' is only used as a symbol to hide the one he was really wrestling with\\". However, Malcolm X also states that John of Patmos was also Yakub, and that the Book of Revelation refers to his deeds: \\"John was Yacub. John was out there getting ready to make a new race, he said, for the word of the Lord\\".Malcolm X, Benjamin Karim, The End of White World Supremacy: Four Speeches by Malcolm X, Arcade Publishing, 1989, pp. 53‚Äì54 Sources Olmec heads claimed to demonstrate the existence of a large-headed \\"Negro race\\" in America Ernest Allen argues that \\"the Yakub myth may have been created out of whole cloth by Prophet Fard\\", but could conceivably have been influenced by a real historical event during the struggle between Muslims and Christians for control of Spain. Muslim leader Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur defeated the Franks at the Battle of Alarcos (1195). After the battle 40,000 European prisoners of war were taken to Morocco to labor on Yaqub's building projects. They were then set free and \\"allowed to form a valley settlement located somewhere between Fez and Marrakesh. On his deathbed Ya'qub lamented his decision to allow these Shibanis (as they came to be called) to form an enclave on Moroccan soil, thereby posing a potential threat to the stability of the Moorish empire.\\". Yusuf Nuruddin says that a more direct source was the doctrine of the \\"Yacobites\\" propounded by Timothy Drew's Moorish Science Temple, to which Fard had probably belonged before he founded the NOI. According to Drew, early pre-Columbian civilizations were founded by a West African Moor \\"named Yakub who landed on the Yucatan peninsula\\".Nuruddin, Yusuf, \\"African-American Muslims and the Question of Identity Between Traditional Islam, African Heritage, and the American Way\\", in Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad; John L. Esposito, Muslims on the Americanization Path?, Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 192. This derived from the then-current notion that the gigantic heads created by the ancient Olmec peoples of the Yucat√°n area had \\"negroid\\" features (see Olmec alternative origin speculations), which had led Leo Wiener to argue that they were from West Africa.Ort√≠z de Montellano, Bernard & Gabriel Haslip Viera & Warren Barbour, \\"They Were NOT Here before Columbus: Afrocentric Hyperdiffusionism in the 1990s\\". Ethnohistory, Duke University Press, issued by the American Society for Ethnohistory, 44 (2): pp. 199‚Äì234 > They [Drew's followers] said that the huge stone heads attested to the fact > that the Yakubites evolved into a race of scientific geniuses with large > heads (as depicted in the sculptures) and small bodies. This legend of > Yakub‚Äîa bigheaded scientist‚Äîfinds its way into the mythology of the Nation > of Islam, indicating that the founders of the NOI, W. D. Farrad and Elijah > Muhammad, were influenced by the Moorish Science Temple, and were possibly > even members. Harold Bloom in his book The American Religion argues that Yakub combines elements of the biblical God and the Gnostic concept of the Demiurge, saying that \\"Yakub has an irksome memorability as a crude but pungent Gnostic Demiurge\\".Bloom, Harold, The American Religion The Emergence of the Post Christian Nation, New York, Simon Schuster, 1992, p. 252. Nathaniel Deutsch also notes that Fard and Muhammad draw on the concept of the Demiurge, along with traditions of esotericism in Biblical interpretation, absorbing aspects of Biblical tales to the new narrative, such as the swords of the Muslim warriors keeping the \\"white devils\\" from Paradise, like the flaming sword of the angel protecting the Garden of Eden in Genesis. Edward Curtis calls the story \\"a black theodicy: a story grounded in a mythological view of history that explained the fall of black civilization, the Middle Passage from Africa to the Americas, and the practice of Christian religion among slaves and their descendants.\\"Edward E. Curtis IV, \\"Black Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam, 1960‚Äì1975\\", University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 2006, p. 11. Several commentators state that the story, by associating blacks with ancient high civilizations and whites with cave-dwelling barbarians and gorillas, both uses and spectacularly reverses the populist and scientific racism of the era which identified Africans as primitive, or closer to apes than whites. This drew on earlier criticisms of white supremacist Nordicism, creating a mythic version of \\"attacks on AngloSaxon lineage and behavior that had been voiced by more mainstream black thinkers during the nineteenth century....With these references the [NOI] Muslims replicated the images of European savagery in the Middle Ages that were so pervasive in nineteenth- century black racial thought.\\"Bay, Mia, The White Image in the Black Mind: African-American Ideas about White People, 1830‚Äì1925, Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 213. Deutsch says that \\"Muhammad anchored his radical doctrine within the context of an established scriptural tradition\\" of Biblical exegesis, which \\"was therefore a sophisticated form of resistance to white racism\\". In addition, \\"the long-standing Western tradition of identifying blackness and darkness with evil is thus dramatically reversed\\".Lawrence H. Mamiya, \\"Minister Louis Farrakhan and the Final Call: Schism in the Muslim Movement\\", Earle H. Waugh (ed) The Muslim Community in North America, University of Alberta Press,: Edmonton, 1983, p. 234. Role in the Nation of Islam The doctrine of Yakub was one of the reasons for splits in the Nation of Islam. Malcolm X in his Autobiography notes that, in his travels in the Middle East, many Muslims reacted with shock upon hearing about the doctrine of Yakub, which, while present in NOI theology, does not appear in mainstream Islam.Alex Haley, Autobiography of Malcom X, First Ballentine Books Trade edition, 1992, p. 192 He rejected the story in his later statements, asserting that anyone of any race who intentionally deprives others of basic human rights is a \\"devil\\".Dean E. Robinson, Black Nationalism in American Politics and Thought, Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 46. Warith Deen Mohammed, who took over the Nation of Islam after his father Elijah's death rejected it almost immediately, and tried to re-invent the Nation as a mainstream Sunni Islam movement. Louis Farrakhan reinstated the original Nation of Islam, and has reasserted his belief in the literal truth of the story of Yakub. In a 1996 interview, Henry Louis Gates, Chairman of Harvard University's Afro-American Studies Department, asked him whether the story was a metaphor or literal. Farrakhan claimed that aspects of the story had been proven accurate by modern genetic science and insisted that \\"Personally, I believe that Yakub is not a mythical figure‚Äîhe is a very real scientist. Not a big-head silly thing, as they would like to say.\\"Gates, Henry Louis, ‚ÄúFarrakhan Speaks‚Äù, Transition: An International Review, Summer 1996, pp. 140‚Äì167; Ostow, Mortimer, \\"Black Myths and Black Madness: Is Black Antisemitism Different?\\", in Alan Helmreich; Paul Marcus (ed)Blacks and Jews on the Couch: Psychoanalytic Reflections on Black- Jewish Conflict, Praeger Publishers, 1998, p. 86 Farrakhan's periodical The Final Call continues to publish articles arguing that modern science supports the accuracy of Elijah Muhammad's account of Yakub.\\"National Geographic Proves Teaching on Mr. Yakub\\", The Final Call, May 23, 2013; \\"Myth or high science? Is there evidence of Mr. Yakub?\\", The Final Call, Oct 24, 2010 The NOI splinter groups the Five-Percent Nation and the United Nation of Islam also believe in the Yakub doctrine. In culture =Drama= The American author and playwright Amiri Baraka's play A Black Mass (1965) takes inspiration from the story of Yakub. According to critic Melani McAlister, \\"the character of Yakub, now called Jacoub, is introduced as one of three 'Black Magicians' who together symbolize the black origin of all religions.\\" McAlister argues that, > Baraka turns the Nation's myth into a reinterpretation of the Faust story > and a simultaneous meditation on the role and function of art. As with > Faust, Jacoub's individualism and egotism are his undoing, but his failings > also signal the destruction of a community. Baraka's version of the story > also draws on the Frankenstein tale; he conflates the six hundred years of > Elijah Muhammad's ‚Äúhistory‚Äù into a single, terrible moment of the creation > of a monster.Melani McAlister, \\"Encounters: Culture, Media, and U.S. > Interests in the Middle East, 1945‚Äì2000, University of California Press, > Berkeley, CA, 2001, pp. 105‚Äì107 In Baraka's version the experiment creates a single Frankenstein-like \\"white\\" monster who kills Jacoub and the other magician-scientists and bites a woman, transforming her in a vampire-like way into a white-devil mate for himself. From this monstrous couple the white race is descended. =Rap= According to Charise L. Cheney, the doctrine of Yakub has had a significant influence in rap culture, referring to raps by Kam and Grand Puba. > This pseudoscientific theory of racial formation was embraced by rap > nationalists like former Ice Cube prot√©g√© Kam in his 1995 song ‚ÄúKeep tha > Peace.‚Äù A self-proclaimed member of the Nation, Kam presented organizational > doctrine as a way to explain the roots of black-on-black crime and gang > violence in America's inner cities: ‚ÄúI'm really not knowin' who to blame or > fault / for this tension / I mention this gump / Yakub's cavey / the blue- > eyed punk / playin' both sides against each other / now that's the real > mutha[fucka].‚Äù...

Chuck D of Public Enemy also refers to the story in his song \\"Party for Your Right to Fight\\", referring to the Yakub story by attributing the deaths of African American radicals to the ‚Äúgrafted devils‚Äù conspiring against the ‚ÄúBlack Asiatic Man.‚Äù Method Man of the Wu-Tang Clan promotes the story of Yakub in the Ol' Dirty Bastard's song \\"Raw Hide,\\" saying: \\"A mystery god that's the work of Yacub / The Holy Ghost got you scared to death kid boo!\\". In the Wu-Tang Clan's song \\"Gravel Pit\\", at the end of it, can be heard a vocal sample from a 1977 movie Short Eyes which says about Yakub: \\"Yakub, maker and creator of the devil. Swine merchant... your time is near at hand. Fuck with me and your time will be now. Your presence here affects the mind of my people like a fever. You, Yakub, are the bearer of 9,999 diseases, evil, corrupt, porkchop-eatin' brain!\\". Wu-Tang member Ghostface Killah also references the story of Yakub in his song \\"One\\" from his album Supreme Clientele. He raps: \\"A-yo, the Devil planted fear inside the black babies.\\" He concludes the verse with: \\"Dead meat placed on the shelves, we eat cold cuts / Fast from the hog y'all and grow up,\\" advocating the NOI's dietary practice of avoiding pork.Nation of Islam Nas raps \\"You devils will run back into the caves you came from\\" in his song \\"Message to the Feds, Sincerely, We the People\\" from his album Street's Disciple.

The pain may also extend into the back of the forearm and grip strength may be weak. Onset of symptoms is generally gradual. Golfer's elbow is a similar condition that affects the inside of the elbow. It is due to excessive use of the muscles of the back of the forearm. Typically this occurs as a result of work or sports, classically racquet sports. The diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms with medical imaging used to rule out other potential causes. It is more likely if pain increases when a subject tries to bend back the wrist when the wrist is held in a neutral position. It is classified as a chronic tendinosis, not a tendinitis. Treatment involves decreasing activities that bring on the symptoms together with physical therapy. Pain medications such as NSAIDS or acetaminophen may be used. A brace over the upper forearm may also be helpful. If the condition does not improve corticosteroid injections or surgery may be recommended. Many people get better within one month to two years. About 2% of people are affected. Those 30 to 50 years old are most commonly affected. The condition was initially described in 1873. The name \\"lawn tennis elbow\\" first came into use for the condition in 1882. Signs and symptoms * Pain on the outer part of the elbow (lateral epicondyle) * Point tenderness over the lateral epicondyle‚Äîa prominent part of the bone on the outside of the elbow * Pain from gripping and movements of the wrist, especially wrist extension (e.g. turning a screwdriver) and lifting movements Symptoms associated with tennis elbow include, but are not limited to, radiating pain from the outside of the elbow to the forearm and wrist, pain during extension of wrist, weakness of the forearm, a painful grip while shaking hands or torquing a doorknob, and not being able to hold relatively heavy items in the hand. The pain is similar to the condition known as golfer's elbow, but the latter occurs at the medial side of the elbow.\\"Tennis Elbow ‚Äì MayoClinic.com.\\" Mayo Clinic Medical Information and Tools for Healthy Living ‚Äì MayoClinic.com. 15 Oct. 2008.

Accessed 23 January 2018.\\"Tennis elbow\\", Mayo Clinic, Aug. 2, 2017. Accessed 23 January 2018. The medical term \\"lateral epicondylitis\\" is most commonly used for the condition. Since histological findings reveal noninflammatory tissue, the term ‚Äúlateral elbow tendinopathy,\\" \\"tendinosis,‚Äù or ‚Äúangio-fibroblastic tendinosis‚Äù have been suggested instead of ‚Äúlateral epicondylitis‚Äù. Causes Location of tennis elbow Tennis elbow is a type of repetitive strain injury resulting from tendon overuse and failed healing of the tendon. In addition, the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle plays a key role. Example of repetitive movement that may cause tennis elbow Early experiments suggested that tennis elbow was primarily caused by overexertion. However, studies show that trauma such as direct blows to the epicondyle, a sudden forceful pull, or forceful extension cause more than half of these injuries.KURPPA, K., WARIS, P. and ROKKANEN, P. Tennis elbow: Lateral elbow pain syndrome. Scand j. work environ. & health 5 (1979): suppl. 3, 15‚Äì18. A review of the etiology, occurrence and pathogenesis of \\"tennis elbow\\" is presented. Repeatedly mis-hitting a tennis ball in the early stages of learning the sport causes shock to the elbow joint and may contribute to contracting the condition. There are multiple aspects of tennis that may cause a player to develop ‚Äútennis elbow‚Äù. From a technical perspective, leading a backhand with your elbow, excessive pronation of the forearm when putting topspin on a forehand, and excessive flexion of the wrist on a serve can all greatly lead to tennis elbow. Other things that can be improved are: racquet type, grip size, string tension, type of court surface, and ball weight. Pathophysiology Histological findings include granulation tissue, microrupture, degenerative changes, and there is no traditional inflammation. Longitudinal sonogram of the lateral elbow displays thickening and heterogeneity of the common extensor tendon that is consistent with tendinosis, as the ultrasound reveals calcifications, intrasubstance tears, and marked irregularity of the lateral epicondyle. Although the term ‚Äúepicondylitis‚Äù is frequently used to describe this disorder, most histopathologic findings of studies have displayed no evidence of an acute, or a chronic inflammatory process. Histologic studies have demonstrated that this condition is the result of tendon degeneration, which replaces normal tissue with a disorganized arrangement of collagen. Therefore, the disorder is more appropriately referred to as tendinosis or tendinopathy rather than tendinitis. Colour Doppler ultrasound reveals structural tendon changes, with vascularity and hypo-echoic areas that correspond to the areas of pain in the extensor origin. The pathophysiology of lateral epicondylitis is degenerative. Non-inflammatory, chronic degenerative changes of the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle are identified in surgical pathology specimens. It is unclear if the pathology is affected by prior injection of corticosteroid. Tennis players generally believe tennis elbow is caused by the repetitive nature of hitting thousands of tennis balls, which leads to tiny tears in the forearm tendon attachment at the elbow.Craig Smith, \\"What is tennis elbow?\\", BBC Sport Academy. Accessed 23 January 2018. The extensor digiti minimi also has a small origin site medial to the elbow that this condition can affect. The muscle involves the extension of the little finger and some extension of the wrist allowing for adaption to \\"snap\\" or flick the wrist‚Äîusually associated with a racquet swing. Most often, the extensor muscles become painful due to tendon breakdown from over-extension. Improper form or movement allows for power in a swing to rotate through and around the wrist‚Äîcreating a moment on that joint instead of the elbow joint or rotator cuff. This moment causes pressure to build impact forces to act on the tendon causing irritation and inflammation. At least one author questions that lateral epicondylitis is caused by repetitive microtrauma/overuse, maintaining the theory is likely overstated and lacks scientific support. Other speculative risk factors for lateral epicondylitis include taking up tennis later in life, unaccustomed strenuous activity, decreased mental chronometry and speed and repetitive eccentric contraction of muscle (controlled lengthening of a muscle group). Diagnosis =Physical examination= To diagnose tennis elbow, physicians perform a battery of tests in which they place pressure on the affected area while asking the patient to move the elbow, wrist, and fingers. Diagnosis is made by clinical signs and symptoms that are discrete and characteristic. For example, when the elbow fully extended, the patient feels points of tenderness over the affected point on the elbow. The most common location of tenderness is at the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle from the lateral epicondyle (extensor carpi radialis brevis origin), 1 cm distal and slightly anterior to the lateral epicondyle. There is also pain with passive wrist flexion and resistive wrist extension (Cozen's test).Tennis elbow from the MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia =Medical imaging= X-rays can confirm and distinguish possibilities of existing causes of pain that are unrelated to tennis elbow, such as fracture or arthritis. Rarely, calcification can be found where the extensor muscles attach to the lateral epicondyle. Medical ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are other valuable tools for diagnosis but are frequently avoided due to the high cost. MRI screening can confirm excess fluid and swelling in the affected region in the elbow, such as the connecting point between the forearm bone and the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle. Prevention Where lateral epicondylitis is caused by playing tennis, another factor of tennis elbow injury is experience and ability. The proportion of players who reported a history of tennis elbow had an increased number of playing years. As for ability, poor technique increases the chance for injury much like any sport. Therefore, an individual must learn proper technique for all aspects of their sport. The competitive level of the athlete also affects the incidence of tennis elbow. Class A and B players had a significantly higher rate of tennis elbow occurrence compared to class C and novice players. However, an opposite, but not statistically significant, trend is observed for the recurrence of previous cases, with an increasingly higher rate as ability level decreases. Other ways to prevent tennis elbow: * Decrease the amount of playing time if already injured or feeling pain in outside part of the elbow. * Stay in overall good physical shape. * Strengthen the muscles of the forearm: (pronator quadratus, pronator teres, supinator muscle) and Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus and Brevis‚Äîthe upper arm: (biceps, triceps)‚Äîand the shoulder (deltoid muscle) and upper back (trapezius). Increased muscular strength increases stability of joints such as the elbow. * Like other sports, use equipment appropriate to your ability, body size, and muscular strength. * Avoid any repetitive lifting or pulling of heavy objects (especially over your head) Vibration dampers (otherwise known as \\"gummies\\") are not believed to be a reliable preventative measure. Rather, proper weight distribution in the racket is thought to be a more viable option in negating shock.http://www.racquetresearch.com/sevencri.htm#What Causes Tennis Elbow? Treatment Evidence for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis before 2010 was poor. There were clinical trials addressing many proposed treatments, but the trials were of poor quality. In some cases, severity of tennis elbow symptoms mend without any treatment, within six to 24 months. Tennis elbow left untreated can lead to chronic pain that degrades quality of daily living. =Physical therapy= There are several recommendations regarding prevention, treatment, and avoidance of recurrence that are largely speculative including stretches and progressive strengthening exercises to prevent re-irritation of the tendon and other exercise measures. One way to help treat minor cases of tennis elbow is simply to relax the affected arm. The rest lets stress and tightness within the forearm slowly relax and eventually have the arm in working condition‚Äîin a day or two, depending on the case. Eccentric exercise using a rubber bar is highly effective at eliminating pain and increasing strength.Reynolds, Gretchen, \\"Phys Ed:An Easy Fix for Tennis Elbow?\\", The New York Times, August 25, 2009, 11:54 pm The exercise involves grasping a rubber bar, twisting it, then slowly untwisting it. Although it can be considered an evidence-based practice, long-term results have not yet been determined. There are differences in opinions on whether it is okay if pain occurs during these exercises. Some suggest pain of less than 5/10 is okay. Moderate evidence exists demonstrating that joint manipulation directed at the elbow and wrist and spinal manipulation directed at the cervical and thoracic spinal regions results in clinical changes to pain and function. There is also moderate evidence for short-term and mid-term effectiveness of cervical and thoracic spine manipulation as an add-on therapy to concentric and eccentric stretching plus mobilisation of wrist and forearm. Although not yet conclusive, the short-term analgesic effect of manipulation techniques may allow more vigorous stretching and strengthening exercises, resulting in a better and faster recovery process of the affected tendon in lateral epicondylitis. Low level laser therapy, administered at specific doses and wavelengths directly to the lateral elbow tendon insertions, may result in short-term pain relief and less disability. =Orthotic devices= Counterforce orthosis reduces the elongation within the musculotendinous fibers Wrist extensor orthosis reduces the overloading strain at the lesion area Orthosis is a device externally used on the limb to improve the function or reduce the pain. Orthotics may be useful in tennis elbow, however long-term effects are unknown. There are two main types of orthoses prescribed for this problem: counterforce elbow orthoses and wrist extension orthoses. Counterforce orthosis has a circumferential structure surrounding the arm. This orthosis usually has a strap which applies a binding force over the origin of the wrist extensors. The applied force by orthosis reduces the elongation within the musculotendinous fibers. Wrist extensor orthosis maintains the wrist in the slight extension. This position reduces the overloading strain at the lesion area. Studies indicated both type of orthoses improve the hand function and reduce the pain in people with tennis elbow. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy, while safe, is of unclear benefit. =Medication= Although anti- inflammatories are a commonly prescribed treatment for tennis elbow, the evidence for their effect is usually anecdotal with only limited studies showing a benefit. A systematic review found that topical non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may improve pain in the short term (up to 4 weeks) but was unable to draw firm conclusions due to methodological issues. Evidence for oral NSAIDs is mixed. Evidence is poor for long term improvement from injections of any type, whether corticosteroids, botulinum toxin, prolotherapy or other substances. Corticosteroid injection may be effective in the short term however are of little benefit after a year, compared to a wait-and-see approach. A recent randomized control trial comparing the effect of corticosteroid injection, physiotherapy, or a combination of corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy found that patients treated with corticosteroid injection versus placebo had lower complete recovery or improvement at 1 year (Relative risk 0.86). Patients that received corticosteroid injection also had a higher recurrence rate at 1 year versus placebo (54% versus 12%, relative risk 0.23). Complications from repeated steroid injections include skin problems such as hypopigmentation and fat atrophy leading to indentation of the skin around the injection site. Steroid injections against appear to be more effective than shock wave therapy. Botulinum toxin type A to paralyze the forearm extensor muscles in those with chronic tennis elbow that has not improved with conservative measures may be viable. =Surgery= In recalcitrant cases surgery may be an option. Surgical methods include: *Lengthening, release, debridement, or repair of the origin of the extrinsic extensor muscles of the hand at the lateral epicondyle *Rotation of the anconeus muscle *Denervation of the lateral epicondyle *Decompression of the posterior interosseous nerve Surgical techniques for lateral epicondylitis can be done by open surgery, percutaneous surgery or arthroscopic surgery, with no evidence that any particular type is better or worse than another. Side effects include infection, damage to nerves and inability to straighten the arm. Prognosis Response to initial therapy is common, but so is relapse (25% to 50%) and/or prolonged, moderate discomfort (40%). Depending upon severity and quantity of multiple tendon injuries that have built up, the extensor carpi radialis brevis may not be fully healed by conservative treatment.

Epidemiology In tennis players, about 39.7% have reported current or previous problems with their elbow. Less than one quarter (24%) of these athletes under the age of 50 reported that the tennis elbow symptoms were \\"severe\\" and \\"disabling,\\" while 42% over the age of 50 did. More women (36%) than men (24%) considered their symptoms severe and disabling. Tennis elbow is more prevalent in individuals over 40, where there is about a four-fold increase among men and two-fold increase among women. Tennis elbow equally affects both sexes and, although men have a marginally higher overall prevalence rate as compared to women, this is not consistent within each age group, nor is it a statistically significant difference. Playing time is a significant factor in tennis elbow occurrence, with increased incidence with increased playing time being greater for respondents under 40. Individuals over 40 who played over two hours doubled their chance of injury. Those under 40 increased it 3.5 fold compared to those who played less than two hours per day. History German physician F. Runge is usually credited for the first description of the condition, calling it \\"writer's cramp\\" (Schreibekrampf) in 1873. Later, it was called \\"washer women's elbow\\".Science and Racket Sports Edited by: T. Reilly, M. Hughes and A.Lees. Published by E & FN Spon .

She was an Andrew Dickson White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University. She received the Tony Award for Best Play and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1989 for her play The Heidi Chronicles. Biography =Early years= Wasserstein was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, the daughter of Morris Wasserstein, a wealthy textile executive, and his wife, Lola (n√©e Liska) Schleifer, who moved to the United States from Poland when her father was accused of being a spy.\\"Wendy Wasserstein\\" jwa.org, accessed June 29, 2014 Wasserstein \\"once described her mother as being like 'Auntie Mame'\\".Simonson, Robert. \\"Wendy Wasserstein, Playwright Who Dramatized the Progress of a Generation of Women, Is Dead at 55\\" playbill.com, January 30, 2006 Lola Wasserstein reportedly inspired some of her daughter's characters. Wendy was the youngest of five siblings, including brother Bruce Wasserstein, a well- known investment banker. Her maternal grandfather was Simon Schleifer, a yeshiva teacher in W≈Çoc≈Çawek, Poland, who moved to Paterson, New Jersey and became a high school principal. Claims that Schleifer was a playwright are probably apocryphal, as contemporaries did not recall this and the assertion only appeared once Wasserstein had won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. A graduate of the Calhoun School (she attended from 1963 to 1967),\\"Wendy Wasserstein, '67\\" calhoun.org, accessed June 29, 2014 Wasserstein earned a B.A. in history from Mount Holyoke College in 1971, an M.A. in creative writing from City College of New York in 1973, and an M.F.A. in fine arts from the Yale School of Drama in 1976. In 1990 she received an honoris causa Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Mount Holyoke College\\"Wendy Wasserstein Pulitzer-Prize Winning Playwright, to Speak\\" mtholyoke.edu, September 20, 2001 and in 2002 she received an honoris causa degree from Bates College.\\"2002 About the Speakers\\" bates.edu, accessed June 29, 2014 =Career= Wasserstein's first production of note was Uncommon Women and Others (her graduate thesis at Yale), a play which reflected her experiences as a student at, and an alumna of, Mount Holyoke College. The play was workshopped at the Eugene O‚ÄôNeill Theater Center in 1977, and a full version of the play was produced in 1977 Off-Broadway with Glenn Close, Jill Eikenberry, and Swoosie Kurtz playing the lead roles. The play was subsequently produced for PBS with Meryl Streep replacing Close. While at Yale, she co-wrote a musical with fellow student Christopher Durang, When Dinah Shore Ruled the Earth. In 1989, she won the Tony Award, the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for her play The Heidi Chronicles. Her plays, which explore topics ranging from feminism to family to ethnicity to pop culture, include The Sisters Rosensweig, Isn't It Romantic, An American Daughter, Old Money, and her last work, which opened in 2005, Third. During her career, which spanned nearly four decades, Wasserstein wrote eleven plays, winning a Tony Award, a Pulitzer Prize, a New York Drama Critics Circle Award, a Drama Desk Award, and an Outer Critics Circle Award. In addition, she wrote the screenplay for the 1998 film The Object of My Affection, which starred Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd. Wasserstein is described as an author of women's identity crises. \\"Her heroines‚Äîintelligent and successful but also riddled with self-doubt‚Äîsought enduring love a little ambivalently, but they did not always find it, and their hard-earned sense of self-worth was often shadowed by the frustrating knowledge that American women's lives continued to be measured by their success at capturing the right man.\\" In a conversation with novelist A. M. Homes, Wasserstein said that these heroines are the starting points for her plays: \\"I write from character, so it begins with people talking, which is why I like writing plays.\\"Homes, A. M. \\"Wendy Wasserstein\\". Bomb. Spring 2001. Retrieved July 22, 2011. Wasserstein commented that her parents allowed her to go to Yale only because they were certain she would meet an eligible lawyer there, get married, and lead a conventional life as a wife and mother. Although appreciative of the critical acclaim for her comedic streak, she described her work as \\"a political act\\", wherein sassy dialogue and farcical situations mask deep, resonant truths about intelligent, independent women living in a world still ingrained with traditional roles and expectations. In 2007 she was featured in the film Making Trouble, a tribute to female Jewish comedians, produced by the Jewish Women's Archive. Wasserstein also wrote the books to two musicals. Miami, written in collaboration with Jack Feldman and Bruce Sussman, was presented at Playwrights Horizons in 1985‚Äì1986, and starred among others, Marcia Lewis, Phyllis Newman, Jane Krakowski, and Fisher Stevens.Playbill: Playwrights Horizons: Miami, Playbill Inc.

It is estimated to have about 1000 speakers (). Background The name Kujarg√© (also spelled Kujarke) is derived from the Sudanese Arabic word (, \\"sorcerer\\"), due to the Kujarke's reputation for practicing witchcraft among the Sinyar people. The speakers were reported to live mainly by hunting and gathering due to the climate, terrain, and unstable seasonal water supply of the Dar Fongoro area being inhospitable for intensive agriculture and animal husbandry. Honey was one of their main foods obtained through foraging. The Kujarge refer to themselves as Kujartenin Debiya. They are surround by the Daju-Galfig√© to the west, the Sinyar to the north, and the Fur-Dalinga, Fongoro, Formono, and Runga to the east and south. Historically, they had been ruled by the Daju sultans, and may have been slaves of the Daju. Also, Lebeuf (1959) reports that the Daju Nyala refer to the Darfur Birgid as Kajarg√©. Classification Kujarge is unclassified. It is known only from a 200-word list by Doornbos (1981). These include Chadic words, but low numerals and pronouns look very un-Chadic.Harald Hammarstr√∂m, 2010, 'The status of the least documented language families in the world'. In Language Documentation & Conservation, v 4, p 183 Blench (2008) notes that much of the basic vocabulary looks Cushitic, and speculates that Kujarge could even be a conservative language transitional between Chadic and Cushitic.Roger Blench, 2008. 'Links between Cushitic, Omotic, Chadic and the position of Kujarge'. (ms) The language had been classified as a member of the Mubi subgroup of Chadic by Paul Newman; however, Lionel Bender argued that its classification remained uncertain. There may have been a mix-up with Birgit, a nearby Mubi language which is also called Kujarge; when Newman was shown the 200-word list in 2006, he would not commit to it being Chadic. In addition, there appears to be a large amount of vocabulary that has not been identified as Afro-Asiatic; there is a possibility that it is a language isolate that has been largely relexified by Chadic and Cushitic.Roger Blench and Mauro Tosco, 2010. 'Cushitic, Omotic, Chadic and the position of Kujarge' , Workshop ¬´ Language Isolates in Africa ¬ª, Lyons Bla≈æek (2013) purports to show that Kujarge is an East Chadic language. Documentation and status In 1981, Dutch anthropologist Paul Doornbos had spent 4-5 hours eliciting a basic vocabulary list of Kujarke from a father and son (Arbab Yahia Basi, born Ndundra, who was 35 years old in 1981) in Ro Fat√°, near Foro Boranga, Darfur. The first 100 words were elicited from the informant's father, who was nearly deaf and had limited knowledge of Arabic, while the second 100 words were provided by the main informant, who may have mixed Kujarke with Daju and Fur. Part of the interview had also been done in Fur with the help of Doornbos' Fur research assistant. The two disagreed over the Kujarke elicitations, leading Doornbos to doubt the accuracy of the list. Doornbos also speculates that in 1981, Kujarke may have already been a dying language with few speakers left, although their population may have exceeded 1,000 people in 1981.Doornbos, Paul; Paul Whitehouse (ed). 2005. Kujarge field notes. (Unpublished 1981 field notes of Paul Doornbos transcribed by Paul Whitehouse in 2005) The father and son had also disagreed about the origins of the Kujarke people. According to the son, the Kujarke had originally lived in the mountain ranges to east of the Wadi Azum, namely the Jebel Kulli, Jebel Toya, Jebel Kunjaro, Jebel Turabu, Jebel Oromba, and Jebel Kire. Later, they were forced to migrate to Chad during the time of the Fur sultans. However, the father claimed that the original Kujarke homeland had only been in Chad. Due to the war in Darfur, most Kujarke may now be living in refugee camps in the Goz Be√Øda and Dar Sila regions of eastern Chad. However, the Kujarke have not been recorded as a separate group by any government or foreign aid organization. As a result, Kujarke may have been passing themselves off as Daju or Fur. The first time the Kujarke had been mentioned in over 25 years was when French anthropologist Jerome Tubiana had interviewed a Daju village chief in Tiero. The chief of Tiero mentioned that a Kujarke village had been burned to the ground by the Janjaweed in 2007 during an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Daju people. Nothing else is known about the current state of the Kujarke people. Ethnic group The Kujarke lived in proximity with the Sinyar, Daju, and Fur peoples. Although the Kujarke were mostly endogamous, Sinyar men may have also intermarried with Kujarke women, as Kijaar was the name of one of the 18 Sinyar clans. The Kijaar clan was located closer to the core Kujarke area of Jebel Mirra than all of the other Sinyar clans. The Kujarke are not Muslims and practice a secret religion that is yet unrecorded, as the Kujarke would lead visitors to a perimeter outside their village whenever they needed to perform their prayers.

Sadlier went on to serve Edward VI. Having signed the device settling the crown on Jane Grey in 1553, he was obliged to retire to his estates during the reign of Mary I. Sadlier was restored to royal favour during the reign of Elizabeth I, serving as a Privy Councillor and once again participating in Anglo-Scottish diplomacy. He was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in May 1568. Sutton House, Hackney, was built in 1535 by Sir Ralph Sadleir Family and early life Ralph Sadler was born in Hackney, Middlesex, the elder son of Henry Sadler, a minor official in the service of the Marquess of Dorset and Sir Edward Belknap. Henry Sadler was originally from Warwickshire, but later settled in Hackney. Ralph had a brother, John, who commanded a company at the Siege of Boulogne in 1544. At around seven years of age, Sadler was placed in the household of Thomas Cromwell, later Earl of Essex, where he received an excellent education. He was taught to read and write, becoming fluent in French, Latin and Greek and acquired a working knowledge of the law. He proved to be not only intelligent and resourceful, but also capable of great feats of horsemanship and was skilled at falconry. He was fortunate to find allocation of lodging at Court, without which an aspiring courtier had to seek permission from the King, and a potentially ruinous bill for accommodation near Hampton Court. He pleaded with Cromwell that banishment from court would mean utter disgrace and penury.History of the King's Works; Weir (2001), p.31 Roger Ascham compared Sadlier's appearance in terms of complexion, countenance and beard to Duke Maurice, although the Duke was taller. Sadlier is also represented by his tomb effigy at Standon, and he may have been painted by Hans Holbein the Younger.  Courtier and diplomat  Sadler began his career as secretary to Thomas Cromwell and went on to serve four Tudor monarchs. During his long career in royal service, he would hold many offices, including: * Clerk of the Hanaper 1535‚Äì1587 * Gentleman of the Privy Chamber by May 1536 * Ambassador to Scotland 1537, 1540, 1542 * Jointly (with John Godsalve, Gregory Railton and Francis Kempe) prothonotary, Chancery 1537 ‚Äì 1587? * Principal Secretary April 1540 ‚Äì April 1543 * Privy Councillor 1540‚Äì1553, 1566‚Äì1587 * Master of the Great Wardrobe 1543‚Äì1553 * Justice of the Peace Hertfordshire 1544‚Äì1547, 1558/59 ‚Äì 1561, Gloucestershire 1547, Hertfordshire 1562‚Äì1587 * Chamberlain or receiver, Court of General Surveyors by 1545 * Commissioner for Musters, Hertfordshire 1546, loan 1546, 1562, goods of churches and fraternities 1550, relief, Hertfordshire and London 1550, ecclesiastical causes 1572 * Steward of Hertford and Constable of Hertford Castle December 1549 ‚Äì 1554, 1559‚Äì1587 * Warden of the East and Middle Marches 1559‚Äì1560 * Custos rotulorum Hertfordshire. by 1562 ‚Äì 1587 * Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster 1568‚Äì1587 * Lord Lieutenant, Hertfordshire 1569 =In the service of Cromwell and the King, 1526 to 1539= By the time he was nineteen, Sadler was serving as Thomas Cromwell's secretary, learning about administration, finance and politics. In this role he handled Cromwell's household business and was also involved in drafting and writing his correspondence. By 1529, he had become one of Cromwell's most trusted friends and was appointed as an executor of his will. Between 1525 and 1529, his name appeared in Cromwell's correspondence in connection with suppression of monasteries. It is probably around this time that his talents came to the attention of the king. He was granted the manor and lands from the suppressed St Leonard's Priory in Bow. It was probably soon after Cromwell's elevation to the peerage, on 9 July 1536, that Sadler was named a gentleman of the Privy Chamber. In the same year, he became M.P. for Hindon, Wiltshire and his name also appears in the list of administrators named for Catherine of Aragon's will. In January 1537, Sadler was sent to Scotland to investigate complaints made by Margaret Tudor, the King's sister, against her third husband, Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven, and to improve Anglo-Scottish relations. He succeeded in both respects. On 1 April 1537, Ralph met James V of Scotland, newly married to Madeleine of Valois, at Rouen. The King was pleased with Sadler's work, and sent him again to Scotland, this time to discourage the King of Scotland, James V, from accepting Cardinal Beaton's proposed Franco- Scottish alliance. Sadlier failed in that respect, but the King was nonetheless impressed with his work. In 1539 he was elected knight of the shire (MP) for Middlesex. = Mr. Secretary: Henry VIII and Edward VI, 1540 to 1557 = In April 1540, Sadler was made principal secretary to the king, a position he held jointly with Thomas Wriothesley. In the same year, he was knighted, made a privy councillor, and began more than 30 years of service representing Hertfordshire in Parliament. He represented Preston in 1545. Sadler survived the fall from power and subsequent execution of his friend and mentor in 1540, however, during the power struggle following Cromwell's demise, he was arrested and sent to the Tower. On the evening of 17 January 1541, the Imperial ambassador, Eustace Chapuys and the French ambassador, Charles de Marillac reported to their masters that Sir Ralph Sadlier and Sir Thomas Wyatt had been arrested, as had another courtier Sir John Wallop. The following morning, they were taken from Hampton Court, with their hands bound, accompanied by 24 archers, to the Tower. Marillac noted that it \\"must be some great matter\\" for Wyatt \\"has for enemies all who leagued against Cromwell, whose minion he was.\\" Sadler was able to clear himself and was released in a few days, returning to the council chamber. He played a leading role in the examination of Catherine Howard and her relatives in November 1541, regained the King's trust and was knighted for his part in holding matters of state while the court went on a summer progress of the North in a tripartite ministry with Lords Audley and Hertford.Correspondance politique de MM De Castillon et de Marillac, ambassadeurs de France en Angleterre, 1537-42 (ed. Jean Kaulek, Paris, 1885); Weir (2001), pp.448-50 Together with his allies in the council, notably Thomas Cranmer, Sadlier gathered evidence in an unsuccessful attempt to discredit Norfolk and Gardiner, the men who had orchestrated Thomas Cromwell's downfall. = From courtier to career diplomat: Mission to Scotland = Mary of Guise discussed politics with Ralph Sadler in her Presence Chamber at Linlithgow Palace Sadler was sent into Scotland to several times. In 1540 he tried to embarrass and undermine the authority of Cardinal Beaton, an ally of France, with letters captured from his messenger Alexander Crichton of Brunstane whose ship had been forced by a storm to put into England. However, James V of Scotland refused to accept that the letters were compromising, and argued in favour of the Cardinal that he had a separate spiritual authority in Scotland apart from the King's own temporal powers. Later, when the Cardinal was present, James and Sadler compared the captured letters with Beaton's copies, and found a discrepancy. James V said he was thankful to Sadler and his uncle Henry VIII but still would not find fault in the Cardinal's actions.Arthur Clifford, Sadler State Papers, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 25-28, 42-44. Following the Battle of Solway Moss, Sadler was sent to Scotland again, in March 1543, to arrange a marriage between the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, and Edward, Prince of Wales. He was a successful negotiator for the Treaty of Greenwich, although the marriage was not concluded. On 22 March 1543 he rode from Edinburgh to Linlithgow Palace to see the queen for the first time. Mary of Guise showed him the queen out of her swaddling and Sadler wrote that the infant was \\"as goodly a child I have seen, and like to live\\". Mary reminded him that in turn Regent Arran wanted his son James Hamilton to marry Princess Elizabeth. Mary tried to work on him to intercede for Regent Arran to release Cardinal Beaton from imprisonment, alleging the Cardinal's political expertise could be employed to mutual benefit.Arthur Clifford, Sadler State Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 86-8. Henry VIII wanted English servants in Mary's household, and Sadler recommended \\"Lady Edongcomb\\" for this role, his friend the widow of Peter Edgecumbe of Cotehele.Arthur Clifford, Sadler State Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1809), p. 230. Ralph Sadler talked to Mary of Guise in her Audience Chamber at Stirling Castle On 10 August 1543 Sadler wrote to Henry VIII describing another visit to Mary of Guise and the infant Queen, this time at Stirling Castle; > \\"(Mary of Guise) is very glad that she is at Stirling, and much she praised > there about the house, and told me, \\"That her daughter did grow apace; and > soon,\\" she said, \\"she would be a woman, if she took of her mother;\\" who > indeed, is of the largest stature of women. And therefore she caused also > the child to be brought to me, to the intent I might see her, assuring your > majesty, that she is a right fair and goodly child, as any that I have seen > for her age.\\" Ralph Sadler left Edinburgh for the safety of Tantallon Castle By November Sadler, fearing for his safety as the mood in Edinburgh turned against England, moved to Tantallon Castle, which belonged to the Earl of Angus. Regent Arran sent the Rothesay Herald to Tantallon, ordering him to return Sadler to England, having \\"seen daily his great practices made to seduce and corrupt true faithful subjects of this realm to the opinion of England.\\"State Papers Henry VIII, 5:4 (London, 1836), p. 350 The Earl's kinsmen conveyed him to Berwick upon Tweed on 11 December 1543. All of his work in solidifying Anglo-Scottish relations came to nothing, and war followed after the Scottish rejection of Treaty of Greenwich in December 1543. Sadler was replaced by William Paget as Secretary of State in April 1543, owing to his frequent absences on diplomatic missions, but was appointed Master of the Great Wardrobe. He was treasurer for the war against Scotland with the Earl of Hertford during his punitive expedition to Edinburgh in May 1544. Sadler accompanied Hertford into Scotland, in the same role in September 1545. He accompanied Lord Hertford again, this time at the Battle of Pinkie in the post of High Treasurer of the Army. On 10 September 1547, in recognition of his services during the fighting, Sadler was made a knight banneret. Sadlier was present when Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, was arrested, and he also accompanied the force that put down Robert Kett's Norfolk Rebellion. When Henry VIII was preparing his will on Boxing Day 1546, he had already appointed Sadler onto the Council of Regency that was to rule England during Edward VI's minority and left him ¬£200 in his will.Weir (2001), p.499 In 1550 Sadler sold his mansion at Hackney. He was one of the signatories of Edward VI's will in 1553, proving one of the radicals in a Protestant government. He signed the device settling the crown on the Protestant Jane Grey, and was noted by Lord Burghley as one of those expected to act on her behalf. =Mary I and Elizabeth I, 1558 to 1587= Miniature of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots On the accession of the Catholic Mary I to the throne, after the resolution of the succession crisis, Sadler lost most of his offices, including master of the great wardrobe, he was removed from the commissions of the peace and excluded from the Privy Council. He was briefly under house arrest from 25 to 30 July 1553 before being granted a pardon on 6 October. For the rest of Mary I's reign he did not sit in any parliament, remaining in semi-retirement at Standon, Hertfordshire. During the reign of Elizabeth I, restored to royal favour, Sadler was sent to Scotland 8 August 1559 to arrange an alliance with the Scottish Protestants, and forward the cause of the Lords of the Congregation and Duke of Chatelherault. After the English became directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of Leith, he was one of the architects of the Treaty of Edinburgh. In 1568 he was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and when Mary, Queen of Scots, fled to England, Sadler was unwillingly appointed to meet with the Scottish commissioners regarding that problem. He was sent to arrest the Duke of Norfolk in Scotland in 1572 following the Rising of the Northern Earls. He was reluctantly appointed jailer of Mary, Queen of Scots. From summer 1584 to spring 1585, Mary was housed at Wingfield Manor and Tutbury Castle, under Sadler's charge. During that time, Elizabeth was nervous about Mary's plans against her. According to Andrea Clarke there was \\"a tangible, palpable sense of heightened levels of fear among Elizabeth‚Äôs government and ministers about her safety in the midst of the danger posed by Mary Queen of Scots, who for many Catholics was a figurehead\\". Sadler was instructed to restrict Mary's freedom. Francis Walsingham chided Sadler for taking Mary \\"hawkyng\\" and for giving her \\"more lybertye now then at any tyme when she was in the E of Shrewsbury chardge.\\" Sadler was required to post guards round the castle and to search the grounds \\"once or twice a moneth.\\" After the Babington Plot, Sadler was on the council that sentenced Mary to death. Marriage and issue Around 1534, Ralph Sadler married Ellen, daughter of John Mitchell, of Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, who at the time of their marriage was believed to be the widow of Matthew Barre (or Barrow) of Sevenoaks in Kent. The couple had three sons and four daughters: An unidentified man, perhaps Sir Ralph Sadler, 1535, Hans Holbein the Younger * Thomas Sadler of Standon, Hertfordshire, (c. 1536 ‚Äì 1607), named after Thomas Cromwell, who succeeded him married twice: :* Ursula, daughter of John Sherington of Lacock, Wiltshire :* Gertrude, daughter of Robert Markham, of Cotham, Nottinghamshire, by whom he had a son Ralph, and a daughter Gertrude, who married Walter Aston, 1st Lord Aston of Forfar * Edward Sadler of Temple Dinsley, (died 4 April 1584) married Anne, daughter and heir of Sir Richard Lee of Sopwell, Hertfordshire * Henry Sadler of Everleigh, Wiltshire, (c. 1538 ‚Äì 1618), married twice: :* Mary, daughter of Gilbert Everley :* Ursula, daughter of John Gill * Anne Sadler (died 1576), married George Horsey of Digswell, Hertfordshire * Mary Sadler married Thomas Bolle of Wallington, Hertfordshire * Jane Sadler (died c. 1587), married Edward Bash of Stanstedbury, Hertfordshire * Dorothy Sadler (died c. 1578), married Edward Elrington of Byrchall, Essex Sadler may have had an illegitimate son, Richard. =The return of Matthew Barre= St. Mary's Church, Standon, Hertfordshire, where Sadler is buried More than eleven years after Ralph and Ellen had married, Matthew Barre returned alive and well from Ireland and was overheard in a London tavern claiming to be the lawful husband of Sadler's wife. Ralph and his wife had seven surviving children, and he was now a very wealthy and influential person at court whose reputation was at stake. Sadler, a man devoted to his wife and children, was informed of the matter in October 1545 while on a diplomatic mission in Scotland. \\"Master Sadler took his matter very heavily,\\" the Lord Chancellor, Wriothesley reported to Secretary Paget. Ellen Mitchell and Matthew Barre had been legally married in 1526, in Dunmow in Essex. They had two daughters before Barre abandoned them and went to Ireland. Ellen stayed in Dunmow for about a year trying to find out where he had gone. She then became a servant of the prioress at the nunnery of Clerkenwell. Determined to find Matthew, she visited his birthplace and with his brothers made further enquiries, but without success. Despairing of an answer she returned to Clerkenwell. Not long afterwards a man belonging to the city of Salisbury positively assured her that her husband was dead. Recommended by the Prioress of Clerkenwell, Ellen entered the service of Thomas Cromwell's mother-in-law, Mercy Pryor, and was dwelling in his house when Ralph Sadler became enamoured of her. Ralph Sadler and Ellen married believing that Matthew Barre was dead. A version of Ellen's story was given by an Elizabethan writer, Nicolas Sander, and cast doubt on her character. Sander claimed that Ellen was related to Thomas Cromwell, and that she had worked for him as a laundress. The 17th-century historian Gilbert Burnet considered that Sander's story was a fiction. Sander was a Jesuit, a Catholic recusant writing with an agenda. He took delight in attempting to discredit leading public figures in England. There was no scandal surrounding the marriage between Ellen and Ralph when it took place. An investigation found that Ellen's first marriage was valid, and Sadler was therefore obliged to have his children legitimised by a private Act of Parliament. In 1546, this Act of Parliament 37 Hen. VIII, c.30 was passed on his behalf. The Act set aside Ellen's marriage to Matthew Barre and made her marriage to Ralph Sadler a true and proper union. Sadler managed to prevent the publication of the Act and its details never appeared among the statutes of the period. The only known contemporary reference to the Act appears in a transcript entitled The Unprecedented Case of Sir Ralph Sadleir in the Library of the Inner Temple.A Catalogue of the Printed Books and Manuscripts in the Library of the Inner Temple, arranged in classes (C. & W. Galabin, Ingram Court, London 1833), p. 116-18, at p. 118 (Hathi Trust), citing benchmark: Press 5, Shelf 3, No. 535, Vol. 6, p. 335. Matthew Barre disappeared from the scene. This episode damaged Sadler's reputation, but not irretrievably. His marriage to Ellen was saved and the couple lived on, without further incident, for many years.  Death  Sadler's wife was still living in 1569; however, there is no further record of her and there is no surviving tomb for her. Sir Ralph died 30 March 1587, reputedly, \\"the richest commoner in England.\\" His tomb lies beneath a magnificent wall monument in St. Mary's Church, Standon, Hertfordshire. He left the majority of his vast landholdings, including Standon and Buntingford, Hertfordshire, to his eldest son and heir, Thomas Sadlier. Henry Sadler received the manors of Hungerford, Berkshire, and Everley, Wiltshire, Jane Bash received a diamond ring and an annuity was provided for Richard Sadler.Richard Sadlier may have been an illegitimate son, or his grandson, the second son of Edward Sadler. see Works Sadler is one of the few Renaissance statesmen for whom extant Parliamentary orations survive, including a speech on succession in 1563 and one on subsidy in 1566. Copies of the orations appear the 1809 two-volume publication of his letters, which includes a biography by Walter Scott. Fictional portrayals Sadler is one of the major characters in Hilary Mantel's 2009 novel Wolf Hall, which gives a fictional portrayal of Sadler's youth and early manhood in the household of Thomas Cromwell. During the BBC 2 series, he is portrayed by Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Sadler also appears prominently in Bring Up the Bodies and The Mirror & the Light, Mantel's sequels to Wolf Hall. He is also a minor character in Philippa Gregory's book The Other Queen, with an account given of the time he spent as the Queen of Scots' gaoler. Ralph Sadler plays a large role in the Queenmaker Series by author Caroline Angus, based on Thomas Cromwell's life between 1529 and 1540, with Ralph Sadler rising at the royal court and as a Scottish ambassador for Henry VIII.

History  When Ezzelino III was elected podest√† of the commune in 1226, he was able to convert the office into a permanent lordship. Upon his death the Great Council elected as podest√† Mastino I, who succeeded in converting the signoria (seigniory) into a family inheritance, governing at first with the acquiescence of the commune, then, when they failed to re-elect him in 1262, he effected a coup d'√©tat and was acclaimed (\\"people's captain\\"), at the head of the commune's troops. In 1277 Mastino was killed by a faction of the nobles. The reign of his son Alberto as capitano (1277‚Äì1302) was an incessant war against the counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided by the House of Este. Of his three sons, Cangrande I inherited the podest√† position in 1308, only the last shared the government (1308) and made a name as warrior, prince and patron of Dante, Petrarch and Giotto. By war or treaty he brought under his control the cities of Padua (1328), Treviso (1329), and Vicenza. Territories held by the Scaligeri in 1336. Cangrande I was succeeded by his nephews Mastino II (1329‚Äì51) and Alberto. Mastino, the richest and most powerful prince of his generation in Italy, continued his uncle's policy, conquering Brescia in 1332 and carrying his power beyond the Po river. He purchased Parma (1335) and Lucca (1339). A powerful league was formed against him in 1337: Florence, Venice, the Visconti, the Este and the Gonzaga all joined, and after a three-year war, the Scaliger dominions were reduced to Verona and Vicenza. His son Cangrande II (1351‚Äì59) was a cruel and suspicious tyrant; not trusting his own subjects, he surrounded himself with German mercenaries, but was killed by his brother Cansignorio (1359‚Äì75), who beautified Verona with palaces, provided it with aqueducts and bridges and founded the state treasury. He also killed his other brother, Paolo Alboino. Fratricide among the Scaligeri continued when Antonio (1375‚Äì87), Cansignorio's natural son, slew his brother Bartolomeo. This aroused the indignation of the people, who deserted him when Gian Galeazzo Visconti of Milan made war on him. Having exhausted all his resources, he fled from Verona at midnight (October 19, 1387), thus ending the Scaliger domination. His son Can Francesco attempted fruitlessly to recover Verona (1390). Guglielmo (1404), natural son of Cangrande II, was more fortunate: with the support of the people, he drove out the Milanese, but he died ten days thereafter, and Verona then submitted to Venice (1405). The last representatives of the Scaligeri lived at the imperial court and repeatedly attempted to recover Verona by the aid of popular uprisings. After the Scaligeri had been ousted, two self-proclaimed members of the family, Giulio Cesare della Scala (also known as Julius Caesar Scaliger) and his son Joseph Justus Scaliger, made a reputation as humanist scholars, though their relationship to the historic Scaliger family is disputed. The church of Santa Maria Antica in Verona is surrounded with the tombs (arche) of the Scaligeri in the form of Gothic shrines, or tempietti, enclosing their sarcophagi: Cangrande della Scala is memorialized with an equestrian statue; Cansignorio by a marble Gothic monument by Bonino da Campione, 1374.

Players could choose which side they wished to fight for, the aliens or the humans, and could also choose one of three different vehicles; each having its own advantages and disadvantages. Although the game was fully playable for one person, it was primarily designed as an online game in which up to 8 players (up to 4 on each side) could play. Players move around the arena attempting to shoot each other, while also looking for power-ups for their vehicles. Typically, the game was played for a set number of minutes, after which the team with the most kills would be declared the winners. If a player was killed while playing the game, they simply respawn. Alien Front Online was originally slated for release in Japan, but was cancelled. A related game, simply titled Alien Front, was announced by Sega for the N-Gage in 2004, but was eventually canceled.

His son, John Herschel, described it as \\"a superb cluster resolvable into countless stars\\". The cluster is located 4.5¬∞ WSW of Theta Ophiuchi and is just visible as a fuzzy point of light using binoculars. Using a telescope with a aperture, the cluster shows an oval appearance with a core and a halo. M19 is one of the most oblate of the known globular clusters. This flattening may not accurately reflect the physical shape of the cluster because the emitted light is being strongly absorbed along the eastern edge. This is the result of extinction caused by intervening gas and dust. When viewed in the infrared, the cluster shows almost no flattening. It lies at a distance of about from the Solar System, and is quite near to the Galactic Center at only about away. This cluster contains an estimated 1,100,000 times the mass of the Sun and it is around 11.9 billion years old.

Billingsley was the Swimming-Diving Coach at Allen Park High School in Wayne County, Michigan from 1955 to 1957 where he molded the beginnings of a swimming program that led to Allen Park eventually capturing the Michigan High School Boys State Championship. Where he went, skills improved and motivations increased; an instructor in swimming and diving skills and students. Hobie Billingsley was Indiana University‚Äôs diving coach from 1959 to 1989, during which time his divers won more than 100 national diving titles. His Olympic gold and bronze medalists include Lesley Bush, Kenneth Sitzberger, Mark Lenzi, Cynthia Potter, Win Young, and Jim Henry. Mr. Billingsley founded the World Diving Coaches Association in 1968, and was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1983. He is considered by many to be one of the most influential figures in the history of diving. His legacy is carried on by his former divers who are now coaches at universities, high schools, and swim clubs throughout the United States. Mr. Billingsley is profiled in the award-winning and widely televised documentary Hobie‚Äôs Heroes ‚Äì 25th Anniversary Edition, which depicts the struggles and successes of young divers training under this legendary coach. Hobie Billingsley is one of only six diving coaches mentioned in the American Red Cross's Swimming and Water Safety [WSI Manual, 2004]; in the chapter on the history of the sport, Hobie is one of only two diving coaches with multiple mentions: he and Dick Kimball (University of Michigan) are credited with 'opening the door for women in varsity diving programs,' and he is cited as contributing to the sport of diving through analysis based on principles of physical laws of motion [both references, pg 20]. Following retirement from university coaching, Hobie continues to be active in the sport, training divers and coaches around the world, and is respected as a speaker on diving history, technique and ethics, and on sports in general. He has recently published the second edition of his Diving Illustrated, a seminal work offering detailed technical support for coaching diving.

The Italian word is ‚Äúimprimitura.‚Äù Ref: The Italian English Cambridge Dictionary (https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/ ) Also, as used by Vasari in: Cerasuolo, Angela, and Helen Glanville. 2017. Literature and artistic practice in the sixteenth century. pp. 124, 190, 242, 409, 410. In painting, imprimatura is an initial stain of color painted on a ground. It provides a painter with a transparent, toned ground, which will allow light falling onto the painting to reflect through the paint layers. The term itself stems from the Italian and literally means \\"first paint layer\\". Its use as an underpainting layer can be dated back to the guilds and workshops during the Middle Ages; however, it came into standard use by painters during the Renaissance, particularly in Italy. The imprimatura not only provides an overall tonal optical unity in a painting but is also useful in the initial stages of the work, since it helps the painter establish value relations from dark to light. It is most useful in the classical approach of indirect painting, where the drawing and underpainting are established ahead of time and allowed to dry. The successive layers of color are then applied in transparent glaze or semi-transparent layers. Care is taken not to cover the imprimatura completely allowing it to show through the final paint layers; this is effective in particular in the middle to dark shadow areas of the work. An imprimatura is usually made with an earth pigment such as raw sienna, and is often diluted with turpentine. The term imprimatura should not be confused with imprimatur, a term used in editing.

It was a derivative of their previous SEA II design, equipped with a more powerful Lorraine engine of 261 kW (350 hp). It made its first flight during the first quarter of 1918, probably near Plessis-Belleville. It was initially tested by Gustave Douchy, a flying ace of 9 victories, then by the pilots of the Centre d'essais en Vol at Villacoublay. The \\"Minist√®re de l'Armement et des Fabrications de guerre\\" (Ministry of Armament and War Production) soon placed an order for 1,000 machines, making the SEA IV the first Dassault-designed aircraft to reach production. Operational history On August 24, 1918, General Duval, commander of A√©ronautique at General Headquarters foresaw the need for two variants to equip the escadrilles at the beginning of 1919: the SEA IV A2 for observation and the SEA IV C2 for fighting. In October, General Headquarters ordered the commissioning of a flotilla to operate these aircraft, and therefore required production to reach 200 planes per month during the first quarter of 1919, to have a force of 400 on hand by April 1. The Armistice, however, meant that the initial order of 1,000 was cancelled, and in the end, only 115 examples were built. These C2s were used for a number of years by several escadrilles in the \\"Regiments d'Aviation\\" at Le Bourget. A further 25 were built by A√©roplanes Henry Potez as the Potez VII, a luxury touring aircraft, and one further example formed the basis of a racing aircraft.

At the height of its popularity in the 1980s and early 1990s, it was the most prominent horror publication in the world. The magazine was released in an age when horror fandom was still a burgeoning subculture; in the late 1970s, most horror publications were concerned with classic cinema, while those that focused on contemporary horror were largely fanzines. Fangoria rose to prominence by running exclusive interviews with horror filmmakers and offering behind-the-scenes photos and stories that were otherwise unavailable to fans in the era before the internet. The magazine would eventually rise to become a force itself in the horror world, hosting its own awards show, sponsoring and hosting numerous horror conventions, producing films, and printing its own line of comics. Fangoria began struggling in the 2010s due to various issues arising from the burgeoning internet which affected other publications as well, including difficulty in generating enough ad revenue to cover printing costs. Publication became sporadic beginning in fall 2015, and the magazine ran through a succession of editors in 2015‚Äì2016, culminating with the February 2017 announcement of Ken Hanley's December 2016 departure, after which the magazine ceased publication. The magazine remained dormant throughout 2017. In February 2018, it was announced that Fangoria had been purchased by Dallas-based entertainment company Cinestate who, under new editor-in-chief Phil Nobile Jr., relaunched the magazine as a print-based quarterly publication. Additionally, Cinestate branched the franchise out into films and books, releasing Puppet Master: The Littlest Reich as the first \\"Fangoria Presents\\" production and Our Lady of the Inferno as the first \\"Fangoria Presents\\" novel under a new literary imprint. In October 2018, Cinestate released the first new Fangoria magazine under their ownership, stylized as \\"Volume 2, Issue 1.\\" In August 2020, Tara Ansley and Abhi Goel acquired Fangoria from Cinestate under Fangoria Publishing, LLC. Planning Fangoria was first conceived of in 1978 by Kerry O'Quinn and Norman Jacobs under the name Fantastica as a companion to their science fiction media magazine Starlog; just as Starlog covered science fiction films for a primarily teenaged audience, Fantastica was intended to cover fantasy films for a similar audience. O'Quinn‚Äîa magazine publishing mogul who had earlier enjoyed tremendous success publishing soap opera fan magazines‚Äîanticipated a groundswell of interest in the fantasy genre, owing to the plans at that time for bringing Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian to the screen; that adaptation would not appear for another four years. The first issue was assembled under the editorship of \\"Joe Bonham\\", a pseudonym taken from the quadriplegic hero of Dalton Trumbo's pacifist novel Johnny Got His Gun. This was a cover for Rolling Stone contributor and screenwriter Ed Naha and writer Ric Meyers, best known for his encyclopedic Great Martial Arts Movies: From Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan. Shortly after the publishing trade press announced the coming launch of Fantastica, the publishers of a Starlog competitor, Fantastic Films magazine, brought suit on the basis of \\"unfair trade\\", contending that its young audience would be confused by the magazine's similar title. The launch of the magazine was delayed by several months as the court deliberated the issue. When, in early 1979, the decision was made in favor of the plaintiff, the publishers of Fantastica were without a usable name, and a pressing need to get the long-delayed issue to the printers. Some quick brainstorming sessions resulted in the name Fangoria, over the objections of Robert \\"Bob\\" Martin, who was hired as editor during the delay. The first issue went to print July 31, 1979, with a cover date of August. Publication =Early years= The first issue of Fangoria was entirely designed around the original 'fantasy film' concept for the magazine, and proved to be a notable publishing failure, as were the next five issues that followed, all continuing with the same conceptual approach. By the time issue four was released and issue six was in preparation, the publisher confided to Martin that the magazine was losing approximately US$20,000 per issue, an amount the small publisher could not sustain for long. Two phenomena allowed Martin to reshape the magazine and bring it back from its low-performing state. First was the immensely positive audience response to one of the articles that appeared in the first issue of Fangoria, an article that celebrated the craft of special makeup effects artist Tom Savini, and his very wet-looking special effects for the 1978 film Dawn of the Dead. Second was the response to the sense of defeat surrounding the magazine. With its demise all but certain, senior employees and the two owners of the publishing firm withdrew and allowed the untried young editor to take the lead, reshaping the book according to what he believed would work. The seventh issue, featuring a cover story on Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining, was the first issue of any US magazine to wholly concern itself with horror films produced in the latter part of the 20th century, with no trace of daintiness about its subject matter. It also was the first issue of Fangoria to achieve a profit. Fangoria Italy, Issue 1. 1990. Subsequent issues would sharpen the focus, but by issue twelve, the formula was well-set, and remains largely unchanged to this date. Martin continued as editor up to 1986, with co-editor David Everitt added in the early 1980s, and after leaving Fangoria worked with film director Frank Henenlotter on the screenplays for Frankenhooker and Basket Case 3: The Progeny. Everitt left the magazine shortly after Martin's departure, and was replaced by Starlog editor David McDonnell, who handled both magazines for several months before turning over the reins to longtime editor Tony Timpone. =1980s and 90s= In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Fangoria tested numerous international horror markets, releasing issues of the magazine modified for various foreign languages. These foreign editions (released in Italy, Japan, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere) lasted only a handful of editions before being discontinued. Additionally, in May 1988, a sister publication titled Gorezone was first published. A second sister publication, titled Toxic Horror followed in 1989. Gorezone was cancelled after twenty- seven issues and one special Tales from the Crypt-themed issue. Toxic Horror was cancelled after five issues. In 1990, Timpone brought in managing editor Michael Gingold, having been previously introduced to his horror-themed fanzine, Scareaphenalia.Fangoria - Meet The Staff In addition to his editorial duties at the magazine, Gingold posted the majority of the news updates on the magazine's official website. It was under Gingold and Timpone's tenure that Fangoria rose to its greatest level of prominence, enjoying widespread recognition and influence in the horror community. =2000s= Creative Group purchased Fangoria (and its parent publication Starlog) in the early 2000s, hoping to branch out the brand identity of the magazine to radio, television, and comics. On December 5, 2007, a warehouse operated by Kable News, in Oregon, Illinois, which contained all back issues of Fangoria and Starlog magazines, was destroyed by fire. As back issues of Fangoria are not re- printed, the only remaining back issues are now housed in private collections or those available on the secondary market. After several failed ventures, Creative Group filed for Chapter 11 on March 21, 2008.American LaFrance, Delphi, Haven, Marcal, Creative: Bankruptcy 08-10975, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan), March 24, 2008. In summer 2008, Fangoria and all of its related brands were purchased by The Brooklyn Company, Inc., led by longtime Fangoria president Thomas DeFeo.Fangoria announces sweeping new web initiative at fangoria.com, Fangoria.com, October 17, 2008. Under DeFeo's ownership, the magazine's brand identity was radically modified in early 2009. The most notable change was a drastic overhaul to the magazine's cover format, including the transformation of the company's long- standing logo. Starting with issue #281, the original Fangoria logo was re- designed and the trademark \\"film strip\\", tagline and additional embedded photos were removed. After consistent fan protest of the changes, the original logo returned starting with issue #305. The \\"film strip\\" photos returned briefly beginning with issue #309. In February 2010, Chris Alexander, a Toronto-based filmmaker and former writer for Rue Morgue, succeeded Tony Timpone as Fangoria's new editor. Under his management the magazine would explore more esoteric genre content, have its cover layout altered a few times, and several new staff members were hired. Alexander also brought back the original Fangoria logo. In 2011, Gorezone was revived with a special The Bloody Best of Gorezone issue before resuming regular publication with issue #28 in 2013. In 2012, Fangoria also began publishing a line of limited edition specials titled Fangoria Legends. =2015 print cessation= In late September 2015, Alexander stepped down as editor-in-chief and left the Fangoria staff. By October, Gingold, who was then serving as managing editor, was hired as the publication's new editor-in-chief. Eight months later, Gingold was fired after twenty-eight years with the magazine and the former managing editor, Ken Hanley, was named the new editor-in-chief. Many within the horror community responded witho shock at Gingold's termination and took it as a sign that the magazine had both lost touch with its fanbase and passed its glory days; Guillermo del Toro took to social media to voice his disappointment with the decision. On February 11, 2017, Hanley announced that he too was no longer involved with the magazine and that he had been on hiatus from the company since mid-December 2016. He also stated that he felt that if the magazine remained under its current ownership, there would likely never be another new issue, especially as a print edition. The last print edition of the magazine, issue #344, was released October 2015. After that issue, four additional issues were published exclusively in a digital format, leaving subscribers of the hard copy editions, as well as Gorezone subscribers, without the issues they paid for. Additionally, contributors such as Josh Hadley have stated that they remain unpaid for published articles and artwork. Fangoria responded to the statements made by Hanley and Hadley on February 13, in which president and owner Tom DeFeo thanked readers and subscribers for their patience and noted his intention to make amends with writers, artists, and subscribers that had been inconvenienced. The statement also noted that lack of sufficient ad revenue had been the reason for the disappearance of print editions but that DeFeo and his staff would continue their attempts to bring print editions back. =Cinestate acquisition and return to print= In February 2018, it was announced that Fangoria had been purchased by film producer Dallas Sonnier through his Texas-based entertainment company Cinestate. Sonnier named Phil Nobile Jr., of the \\"Birth.Movies.Death\\" website as its new editor-in-chief. The company further announced that they would bring back the magazine as a quarterly, exclusively print-based publication, and offer a one-year free subscription to anyone who never received the issues to which they were entitled under the old ownership. In addition to Gingold and Timpone returning as regular columnists, Cinestate further announced that the new writing staff would be composed of S. Craig Zahler, Grady Hendrix, Shudder curator Sam Zimmerman, Birth.Movies.Death's Meredith Borders, author and former Rue Morgue magazine writer Preston Fassel, horror historian Rebekah McKendry, and black feminist critic Ashlee Blackwell. Cinestate plans on branching the franchise into producing films, podcasts and novels. On May 19, 2018, the magazine announced its first licensed novel, Preston Fassel's Our Lady of the Inferno, under their new Fangoria Presents label. The book was released September 11, 2018, to generally positive reviews, ultimately being named one of the ten best horror novels of 2018 by Bloody Disgusting. A week later, on September 18, Fangoria released their second licensed novel, Michael J. Seidlinger's My Pet Serial Killer. In October 2018, Cinestate published their first issue of the magazine, stylized as \\"Volume 2, Issue 1,\\" featuring a cover story on the 2018 film Halloween. =Cinestate controversy and new ownership= In June 2020, The Daily Beast published an expos√© about producer Adam Donaghey's sexual misconduct on the set of a Cinestate film. In August 2020, Fangoria was acquired by Wanderwall Entertainment CEO Tara Ansley and entrepreneur Abhi Goel. The current quarterly printing will continue and editor-in-chief Phil Nobile Jr. and managing editor Meredith Borders will stay on. The new owners plan to launch a multimedia studio and produce and distribute fiction and non- fiction content. Other ventures Starting in 1985, Fangoria branched out into other media outlets including television, films, radio, and comic books. Beginning in 1985, Fangoria has sponsored annual horror movie conventions known as the Weekend of Horrors in Los Angeles, New Jersey, and Chicago (with Austin, Texas, added in 2008).Official Website of Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors Conventions These conventions were produced in association with Creation Entertainment. After breaking ties with Creation in 2009, Fangoria began their own conventions, titling them the \\"Trinity of Terrors\\". Fangoria's Blood Drive, Volume One In 1990, Fangoria Films was created with the goal of financing one feature film a year under this banner. The first film was 1990's Mindwarp, starring Bruce Campbell. They created Children of the Night in 1991 and Severed Ties in 1992, then ceased production.Motion Pictures produced by Fangoria Films, Internet Movie Database, Accessed: May 15, 2008 In 1996, Fangoria Films re-emerged as a distribution company, occasionally using their \\"Gore Zone\\" label, to release twenty low-budget horror features over the next ten years. In 2004‚Äì2005, Fangoria Films produced and distributed Fangoria's Blood Drive, two DVD compilations of award-winning short horror films. The first volume was hosted by musician-turned-filmmaker Rob Zombie, and the second by MuchMusic's (now called FUSE) Mistress Juliya. In 1991, Fangoria began honoring horror cinema with their annual Chainsaw Awards, which were voted on by readers of their magazine. The winners were announced at an awards show in Los Angeles, California, which was produced by Fangoria's managing editor, Michael Gingold. In association with FUSE TV, Fangoria first televised its Chainsaw Awards in 2006. The event occurred on October 15, and was aired on FUSE on October 22. The event was not renewed for 2007, although the awards continued in the magazine.Fangoria Announces Chainsaw Nominees!, Cinematical, August 26, 2006 From 1999 to 2003, they partnered with Bedford Entertainment to attain wider releases of certain Fangoria titles.Fangoria Takes Bite out of Film Market, Hollywood Reporter (Subscription required for full article), Accessed: May 16, 2008 Movies released during this time included I, Zombie: A Chronicle of Pain, The Last Horror Movie, Slashers, and Dead Meat.Motion Pictures distributed by Fangoria Films, Internet Movie Database, Accessed: May 15, 2008 Many of these films featured the Fangoria logo along the top of their video/DVD covers, while Fangoria's involvement in other releases was substantially more subdued. right From 2006 to 2009, Fangoria worked with Creative Group after it had purchased Fangoria in the early 2000s. Fangoria Entertainment was created as a result. This allowed both parties to agitate the Fangoria brand identity to a number of other media outlets in 2006. Creative Group also added a new \\"Vampire Skull\\" logo to Fangoria's properties, which was used extensively after its inception. In 2010, all of Creative Group's Fangoria brands were discontinued. From 2006 to 2007 there was Fangoria TV. Originally conceived as a network television station dedicated to horror films, it was eventually modified to fit a limited online format. From 2006 to 2009 there was Fangoria Radio. Debuting on Friday, June 23, 2006, it was a horror-themed talk radio program which aired on Sirius Radio Channel 108 and XM Radio Channel 139 on Friday nights. It was hosted by Dee Snider and Debbie Rochon, and regularly featured then-editor Tony Timpone. In June 2007, Fangoria Comics was launched. For various reasons, the line abruptly ended a month later in August.Fangoria Comics Shuts Down, Projects, Staff Relocate , Newsarama Press Release, September 26, 2007 Only two series were published: the two-issue series Fourth Horsemen,Fourth Horsemen, Grand Comics Database.

In 2011 Fangoria partnered with producer Carl Amari (The Twilight Zone Radio Dramas) to create Fangoria's Dreadtime Stories, a \\"Lights Out\\" style dark horror radio drama series hosted by Malcolm McDowell and featuring original music by Fangoria editor-in-chief Chris Alexander. The show was streamed off the Fangoria website and could also be heard on Sirius XFM. Fangoria.com The Fangoria online site features daily updates about the world of horror, allowing the Fangoria brand to remain relevant to those who do not typically read print magazines. The website also features several specialized horror blogs, including articles that continue Fangoria's long tradition of being supportive of LGBT people working in the horror industry. Former editor Tony Timpone was very vocally supportive of Clive Barker's coming-out process in the mid-1990s, and Fangoria.com continued this tradition for several years with Sean Abley's \\"Gay of the Dead\\" blog, where he interviewed several dozen members of the gay horror community, including Jeffrey Schwarz, Michael Varrati, JT Seaton, April A Taylor and Jeremy Owen. Following Cinestate's acquisition of Fangoria, the homepage briefly went offline, replaced by a short video announcing the magazine's return. Thereafter, the homepage has been a simple landing page offering subscribers the ability to contact the new staff, submit inquiries, or subscribe to the new publication. Fangoria Chainsaw Awards The Fangoria Chainsaw Awards are an award ceremony for horror films and thriller films. Beginning in 1992, the awards were expanded and an annual ceremony was inaugurated to give out the awards.Ken Williams, \\"Scary Filmsand Fansin Focus\\", Los Angeles Times, May 14, 1992.

It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types. Stromal cell-derived factors 1-alpha and 1-beta are small cytokines that belong to the chemokine family, members of which activate leukocytes and are often induced by proinflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide, TNF, or IL1. The chemokines are characterized by the presence of 4 conserved cysteines that form 2 disulfide bonds. They can be classified into 2 subfamilies. In the CC subfamily, the cysteine residues are adjacent to each other. In the CXC subfamily, they are separated by an intervening amino acid. The SDF1 proteins belong to the latter group. CXCL12 signaling has been observed in several cancers. The CXCL12 gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.  Structure  = Gene = The CXCL12 gene resides on chromosome 10 at the band 10q11.1 and contains 9 exons. This gene produces 7 isoforms through alternative splicing. = Protein = This protein belongs to the intercrine alpha (chemokine CXC) family. SDF-1 is produced in two forms, SDF-1Œ±/CXCL12a and SDF-1Œ≤/CXCL12b, by alternate splicing of the same gene. Chemokines are characterized by the presence of four conserved cysteines, which form two disulfide bonds. The CXCL12 proteins belong to the group of CXC chemokines, whose initial pair of cysteines are separated by one intervening amino acid. In addition, the first 8 residues of the CXCL12 N-terminal serve as a receptor binding site, though only Lys-1 and Pro-2 directly participated in activating the receptor. Meanwhile, the RFFESH motif (residues 12-17) in the loop region function as a docking site for CXCL12 receptor binding.  Function  CXCL12 is expressed in many tissues in mice including brain, thymus, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and bone marrow. CXCL12 is strongly chemotactic for lymphocytes. During embryogenesis, it directs the migration of hematopoietic cells from fetal liver to bone marrow and the formation of large blood vessels. It has also been shown that CXCL12 signalling regulates the expression of CD20 on B cells. CXCL12 is also chemotactic for mesenchymal stem cells and is expressed in the area of inflammatory bone destruction, where it mediates their suppressive effect on osteoclastogenesis. In adulthood, CXCL12 plays an important role in angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from the bone marrow through a CXCR4 dependent mechanism. CXCR4, previously called LESTR or fusin, is the receptor for CXCL12. This CXCL12-CXCR4 interaction used to be considered exclusive (unlike for other chemokines and their receptors), but recently, it was suggested that CXCL12 may also bind the CXCR7 receptor (now called ACKR3). By blocking CXCR4, a major coreceptor for HIV-1 entry, CXCL12 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 strains. = CNS = During embryonic development, CXCL12 plays a role in cerebellar formation through the migration of neurons. Within the CNS, CXCL12 contributes to cell proliferation, neurogenesis (nervous tissue development and growth), as well as neuroinflammation. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are stem cells that differentiate into glial and neuronal cells. CXCL12 promotes their migration to lesion sites within the brain, specifically over extensive ranges. Once at the site of damage, NPCs may begin stem cell based tissue repair to the lesion. The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis provides guidance cues for axons and neurites hence promoting neurite outgrowth (neurons forming projections) and neurogenesis. Like other chemokines, CXCL12 is involved with cell migration that contributes to inflammation. In regards to the CNS, CXCL12 plays a role in neuroinflammation by attracting leukocytes across the blood brain barrier. however, excessive production and accumulation of CXCL12 can become toxic and the inflammation produced may result in serious consequences.  Clinical significance  In humans, CXCL12 has been implicated in a wide variety of biomedical conditions involving several organ systems. Furthermore, CXCL12 signaling in conjunction with CXCR7 signaling has been implicated in the progression of pancreatic cancer. In the urinary tract system, methylation of the CXCL12 promoter and expression of PD-L1 may be powerful prognostic biomarkers for biochemical recurrence in prostate carcinoma patients after radical prostatectomy, and further studies are ongoing to confirm if CXCL12 methylation may aid in active surveillance strategies. In the field of oncology, melanoma associated fibroblasts are stimulated by stimulation of the A2B adenosine receptor followed by stimulation of fibroblast growth factor and increased expression of CXCL12. = Clinical marker = A multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the CXCL12 gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22). = Multiple Sclerosis = A neurological condition that results from a faulty interaction between the immune and nervous systems in multiple sclerosis. MS is characterized by demyelination of nerves due to the body's immune system attacking the CNS. Elevated levels of CXCL12 are observed in the cerebral spinal fluid of patients with MS. CXCL12 crosses the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and causes neuroinflammation that contributes to axonal damage and therefore the progression of multiple sclerosis. = Alzheimer's Disease = Though CXCL12 may be detrimental for those with MS, recent research is suggesting that this chemokine may be beneficial in decreasing the progression of patients with Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's is another neurological condition and the most common form of dementia where cognition significantly declines. One main characteristic of Alzheimer's is the accumulation of a brain plaque known as beta-amyloid. The neuroprotective aspects of CXCL12 in mice with these plaques/Alzheimer's. PAK is a protein associated with maintaining dendritic spines, which are essential at synapses in receiving information from axons. Mislocalization of PAK occurs in patients with Alzheimer's, however pretreatment of neurons in mice with CXCL12 showed a suppression of that mislocalization. Additionally, this pretreatment with CXCL decreased the prevalence of apoptosis and oxidative damage normally caused by the presence of the beta-amyloid plaque. =As a drug target= Chemokines and chemokine receptors, of which CXCR stands out, regulate multiple processes such as morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and immune responses and are considered potential targets for drug development. In the gastrointestinal tract system, the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis is under investigation as an anti-fibrotic therapy in the treatment for chronic pancreatitis. For instance, blocking CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12, with Plerixafor (AMD-3100) increased the effectiveness of combretastatin in a mouse model of breast cancer, presumably by preventing macrophages from being recruited to tumours.[15][16] AMD-3100 is also widely used in combination with G-CSF for mobilizing hematopoietic stem cells into the blood stream, allowing collection for bone marrow transplant.De Clercq E.

For instance, a roll of Industrials, Down, 20 will move the industrials stock from its start value of $1.00 to 80 cents. A roll of Grain, Up, 5 would move grain up to $1.05. Dividends are paid out only for any stocks that are at or above $1.00 in value. For instance, a five- cent dividend pays five cents for each share owned. Thus, if a roll is Oil, Dividend, 10, and you own a thousand shares of Oil at $1.25 apiece you will receive a dividend of $100. Note that the dividend is not affected by the value of the share, with only the rule being that stocks worth less than $1.00 do not pay out when a dividend is rolled for them. If a stock ever reaches $2.00 it splits. Everyone who owns the stock doubles the number of shares owned and the stock goes back to being worth $1.00. If a stock falls to being worth nothing all players lose their investment in that stock and must return their shares to the bank. The stock is then reset at $1.00. There are two basic strategies to making money at the game. The first is to buy whichever stocks are safely in dividend-paying territory. Using this method, if a stock splits and returns to the $1.00 value, the owner should sell out and reinvest in a stock that is safely above par. Similarly, if a stock drops below a dollar, the owner should sell the shares. This technique relies upon the rule that any money invested in a stock paying dividends will earn a greater return than shares that are not paying dividends. The second strategy is more risky, but can also be immensely profitable. It involves buying stocks when they are near the bottom of the board and at risk of being worth nothing. Since the dice-rolling system moves stocks by a fixed amount, rather than a percentage of their value, these stocks are very volatile. One thousand dollars will buy ten thousand shares of a ten-cent stock. While this stock could move down by ten or twenty and be wiped out, the most one would lose is a thousand dollars. However, there is an equal chance that the stock will move up, and a single roll of Up 20 will triple the original investment. The possible return on investing in a five-cent stock, the cheapest possible, is even higher.

Due to its relative isolation from the main islands in the group, Bokak's flora and fauna has been able to exist in a pristine condition.  Geography  It is located north of Majuro Atoll, the capital of the Marshall Islands, and northeast of Bikar Atoll, the closest atoll, making it the most northerly and most isolated atoll of the country. Wake Island is north-northwest. The land area is , and the lagoon measures . It consists of 36 islets. The total area is (including reef flat).Marshall Islands Atoll Information, Bokak (Taongi) Atoll  Physical features  Bokak Atoll - NASA NLT Landsat 7 (Visible Color) Satellite ImageThe atoll is roughly crescent-shaped, measuring about by , and oriented in a north‚Äìsouth direction. The atoll reef is unbroken except for a wide channel in the west. Ten islets lie on the eastern and southeastern reef. The more important named islets, from north to south, are North Island, Kamwome, Bwdije, Sibylla, Bokak, and Bwokwla. Sibylla is the largest, measuring approximately in length and up to in width. Kamwome Islet to the north-east of Sibylla is the second largest, while Bokak (Taongi), after which the atoll is named, lies to the south of Sibylla.UNEP 2008 World Database on Protected Areas Based on the results of drilling operations on Enewetak (Eniwetok) Atoll, in the nearby Ralik Chain of the Marshall Islands, Bokak may include as much as of reef material atop a basalt rock base. As most local coral growth stops at about below the ocean surface, such a massive stony coral base suggests a gradual isostatic subsidence of the underlying extinct volcano,Geoscience Research Institute which itself rises from the surrounding ocean floor. Shallow water fossils taken from just above Enewetak's basalt base are dated to about 55mya.Atoll Research Bulletin No. 260Bokak's perched lagoon sits above the mean tide level, resulting in an unusually calm surface. High boulder and sand ridges indicate a history of severe storms and are a feature of the islets. Inland on the wider islets are sand and rubble flats, while back from the lagoon sides are low sand and gravel ridges. Soils are mostly very immature, a mixture of coarser coral sand and gravel of various textures with very little humus accumulation. The lagoon is shallow, probably not exceeding depth, and has many coral heads and patch reefs, some reaching the surface. The lagoon water level is up to higher than the surrounding ocean due to an influx of wind-driven waters over the windward ocean reef and the presence of only one narrow reef passage on the leeward side. Water cascades over the coral-covered rim and flats of the sloping leeward reef. A massive algal ridge lines the outer edge of the windward reef, while the south and west reefs are coral-covered narrow flats where landings can be made in quiet weather. A very small algal rim, high, on lagoon shores of the westernmost islets, on east-facing lagoon reef-fronts and on the windward edges of coral patches in the lagoon, may be a feature unique to Taongi. This rim is maintained by the constant flow of water over the reef flat.  Climate  Bokak is the driest of the Marshall Islands atolls, having a semi-arid character. Mean annual temperature is approximately . Mean annual rainfall is less than , and falls primarily during the late summer. Prevailing winds are north to north-easterlies.  Vegetation  Lagoon shoreline at Sibylla Island, with coral rubble beach and edge of Naupaka shrubland.Bokak supports just nine plant species. All are native to the Marshall Islands and entirely undisturbed by introduced species. A combination of insufficient rainfall, excellent drainage, and high temperatures lead to an arid environment in which a freshwater Ghyben-Herzberg lens cannot form, and coconut palm is unable to grow.Atoll Research Bulletin No. 113 The most common formation is a low, sparse scrub forest of tree heliotrope (Heliotropium foertherianum), tall, with occasional taller trees. The understory typically comprises beach maupaka (Scaevola taccada), or sparse endemic bunchgrass, ihi (Portulaca molokiniensis), ilima (Sida fallax), or alena (Boerhavia herbstii), the latter being more abundant on broken coral gravel. A small stand of Pisonia grandis is found on Kamwome Islet and in another very small stand on Sibylla. Pure stands of very dense beach naupaka shrubland, sometimes with tree heliotrope, are predominant and cover 50-75% of southern, and nearly 100% of northeastern Sibylla. Heliotropium, Scaevola, and Sida dominated shrublands and the sandy bunchgrass savanna (Lepturus spp.) represent the finest examples of such vegetation in the Marshalls and probably the entire Pacific region. The aquatic vegetation of the shallow edges of the lagoon consists of sparse coralline algae, encrusting fragments of coral, shell etc., and patches of green seaweed.  Fauna  Female frigatebird on Sibylla Island.The atoll supports a large population of sea and shorebirds, with up to 26 species present. Species breeding during 1988 included the brown booby, red-footed booby, great frigatebird, red-tailed tropicbird, sooty tern, white tern, brown noddy, and possibly the reef heron. Migratory birds present included the bristle-thighed curlew, turnstone, wandering tattler, golden plover, and the sanderling. The densest bird populations are on three islets to the north of Sibylla: North (Kita), Kamwome and an unnamed islet. Bokak is the only known breeding ground of Christmas shearwater and possibly Bulwer's petrel.Red- footed booby on Sibylla Island Terrestrial species includes the Polynesian rat on Sibylla. The more aggressive black rat appears to be absent, despite wrecked fishing vessels on the eastern and north eastern reefs.Atoll Research Bulletin No. 446Alele Museum The snake-eyed skink and large hermit crabs are common. Grey reef shark near western pass In general, the aquatic fauna population is healthy, but of low diversity, possibly due to the atoll's isolation. Researchers have not seen any marine turtles, but Polynesian custom regarding harvesting assumed their presence.Atoll Research Bulletin No. 419. Examples of the giant clam family Tridacnidae are very abundant, except for the largest giant clam T. gigas. Smaller bivalves were present, but few Mollusks. The reef fish are primarily emperor breams, parrotfish, and red snappers. Also present are moray eel and grey reef shark. Approximately 100 stony coral species and two soft coral species are present.Marshall Islands Atoll Information, Bokak (Taongi) Atoll.  History  =Prehistory= Although humans migrated to the Marshall Islands about 2000 years ago,University of California, Berkeley there appear to be no traditional Marshallese artifacts present that would indicate any long term settlement. The harsh, desiccated climate, lack of potable water, and poverty of the soils indicate that the atoll will probably remain uninhabited. The atoll has traditionally been used for hunting and gathering, particularly seabirds, by inhabitants of other atolls in the northern Ratak chain. Along with the other uninhabited northern Ratak atolls of Bikar and Toke, Bokak was traditionally the hereditary property of the Ratak atoll chain Iroji Lablab. The exploitation of abundant sea turtles, birds, and eggs was regulated by custom, and overseen by the Iroji.Atoll Research Bulletin No. 11 =16th to 19th Century= The first European to record sighting Bokak was Toribio Alonso de Salazar, a Spanish explorer, on August 22, 1526, who commanded Loaisa expedition after the death of Loaisa and Elcano.Brand, Donald D.

Using the justification that uninhabited atolls were unclaimed, the Germans seized Bokak as government property, despite the protests of the Iroji. As Japan's economic vigor expanded under the Meiji Emperor, the German administration noted Marshallese complaints of Japanese bird poaching, more from the view of protecting German sovereignty, rather than the interests of the islanders. =20th century to present= In 1914, the Empire of Japan occupied the Marshall Islands, and transferred German government properties to their own, including Bokak. Like the Germans before them, the Japanese colonial administration did not attempt to exploit the atoll, and the Northern Radak Marshallese continued to hunt and fish unmolested. As a part of the 1940s Japanese militarization of the Marshall Islands, a small seaplane and communication outpost was established on Sibylla Island. During the early stages of the World War II, USN submarines operating in the area would periodically note patrols by Japanese aircraft.U.S.S.

In 1954, the experience of large scale fallout from the Castle Bravo nuclear test on Bikini Atoll led to a pre-planned aerial survey of atolls adjacent to the subsequent Castle Romeo test, timed at one and four hours after the shot. The aircraft were equipped with gamma radiation detectors designed to measure ground contamination from altitudes of . An overflight of Sibylla Island measured 1.0 mrem/hr (10 ŒºGy) an hour after the shot, dropping to 0.4 mrem/hr (4 ŒºGy) three hours later.Department of Health, Safety, and Security, DOE In 1957, Bokak was surveyed as a site for nuclear weapons testing as a part of Operation Hardtack, but due to the number of improvements required to develop it, was passed over in favor of reusing the Bikini, Enewetak, and Nevada test sites.U.S. Dept. of Energy OPENnet The atoll came under renewed consideration for use during Operation Dominic, but by that time the potential for political fallout from nuclear testing within a United Nations Trust Territory was deemed too great.U.S. Dept. of Energy OPENnet The atoll played a part in the disappearance of several men from Maui, Hawaii. On February 11, 1979, Scott Moorman and four companions set sail from Hana harbor in a 17-foot Boston Whaler, and went missing in subsequent high seas.

Load-bearing walls are one of the earliest forms of construction. The development of the flying buttress in Gothic architecture allowed structures to maintain an open interior space, transferring more weight to the buttresses instead of to central bearing walls. In housing, load-bearing walls are most common in the light construction method known as \\"platform framing\\". In the birth of the skyscraper era, the concurrent rise of steel as a more suitable framing system first designed by William Le Baron Jenney, and the limitations of load-bearing construction in large buildings, led to a decline in the use of load-bearing walls in large-scale commercial structures.  Description  A load-bearing wall or bearing wall is a wall that is an active structural element of a building, that is, it bears the weight of the elements above said wall, resting upon it by conducting its weight to a foundation structure. The materials most often used to construct load-bearing walls in large buildings are concrete, block, or brick. By contrast, a curtain wall provides no significant structural support beyond what is necessary to bear its own materials or conduct such loads to a bearing wall.  History  Load-bearing walls are one of the earliest forms of construction. The development of the flying buttress in Gothic architecture allowed structures to maintain an open interior space, transferring more weight to the buttresses instead of to central bearing walls. The Notre Dame Cathedral is an example of a load- bearing wall structure with flying buttresses. Application Depending on the type of building and the number of floors, load-bearing walls are gauged to the appropriate thickness to carry the weight above them. Without doing so, it is possible that an outer wall could become unstable if the load exceeds the strength of the material used, potentially leading to the collapse of the structure. The primary function of this wall is to enclose or divide space of the building to make it more functional and useful. It provides privacy, affords security, and gives protection against heat, cold, sun or rain. =Housing= In housing, load-bearing walls are most common in the light construction method known as \\"platform framing\\", and each load-bearing wall sits on a wall sill plate which is mated to the lowest base plate. The sills are bolted to the masonry or concrete foundation. PSL lumber installed to replace a load-bearing wall at the first floor of a three-story building. The top plate or ceiling plate is the top of the wall, which sits just below the platform of the next floor (at the ceiling). The base plate or floor plate is the bottom attachment point for the wall studs. Using a top plate and a bottom plate, a wall can be constructed while it lies on its side, allowing for end-nailing of the studs between two plates, and then the finished wall can be tipped up vertically into place atop the wall sill; this not only improves accuracy and shortens construction time, but also produces a stronger wall. =Skyscrapers= Due to the immense weight of skyscrapers, the base and walls of the lower floors must be extremely strong. Pilings are used to anchor the building to the bedrock underground. For example, the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building as well as the world's tallest structure, uses specially treated and mixed reinforced concrete. Over of concrete, weighing more than were used to construct the concrete and steel foundation, which features 192 piles, with each pile being 1.5 m diameter √ó 43 m long ( √ó ) and buried more than deep.

Specifically, any probabilistic, polynomial-time algorithm (PPTA) that is given the ciphertext of a certain message m (taken from any distribution of messages), and the message's length, cannot determine any partial information on the message with probability non-negligibly higher than all other PPTA's that only have access to the message length (and not the ciphertext).S. Goldwasser and S. Micali, Probabilistic encryption & how to play mental poker keeping secret all partial information, Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 1982. This concept is the computational complexity analogue to Shannon's concept of perfect secrecy. Perfect secrecy means that the ciphertext reveals no information at all about the plaintext, whereas semantic security implies that any information revealed cannot be feasibly extracted.Goldreich, Oded. Foundations of Cryptography: Volume 2, Basic Applications. Vol. 2. Cambridge university press, 2004. History The notion of semantic security was first put forward by Goldwasser and Micali in 1982. However, the definition they initially proposed offered no straightforward means to prove the security of practical cryptosystems. Goldwasser/Micali subsequently demonstrated that semantic security is equivalent to another definition of security called ciphertext indistinguishability under chosen- plaintext attack.S. Goldwasser and S. Micali, Probabilistic encryption. Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 28:270-299, 1984. This latter definition is more common than the original definition of semantic security because it better facilitates proving the security of practical cryptosystems. Symmetric-key cryptography In the case of symmetric-key algorithm cryptosystems, an adversary must not be able to compute any information about a plaintext from its ciphertext. This may be posited as an adversary, given two plaintexts of equal length and their two respective ciphertexts, cannot determine which ciphertext belongs to which plaintext. Public-key cryptography For an asymmetric key encryption algorithm cryptosystem to be semantically secure, it must be infeasible for a computationally bounded adversary to derive significant information about a message (plaintext) when given only its ciphertext and the corresponding public encryption key. Semantic security considers only the case of a \\"passive\\" attacker, i.e., one who generates and observes ciphertexts using the public key and plaintexts of her choice. Unlike other security definitions, semantic security does not consider the case of chosen ciphertext attack (CCA), where an attacker is able to request the decryption of chosen ciphertexts, and many semantically secure encryption schemes are demonstrably insecure against chosen ciphertext attack. Consequently, semantic security is now considered an insufficient condition for securing a general-purpose encryption scheme. Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack (IND-CPA) is commonly defined by the following experiment: # A random pair (pk,sk) is generated by running Gen(1^n). # A probabilistic polynomial time-bounded adversary is given the public key pk , which it may use to generate any number of ciphertexts (within polynomial bounds). # The adversary generates two equal-length messages m_0 and m_1, and transmits them to a challenge oracle along with the public key. # The challenge oracle selects one of the messages by flipping a fair coin (selecting a random bit b \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}), encrypts the message m_b under the public key, and returns the resulting challenging ciphertext c to the adversary. The underlying cryptosystem is IND-CPA (and thus semantically secure under chosen plaintext attack) if the adversary cannot determine which of the two messages was chosen by the oracle, with probability significantly greater than 1/2 (the success rate of random guessing). Variants of this definition define indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack and adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA, IND-CCA2). Because the adversary possesses the public encryption key in the above game, a semantically secure encryption scheme must by definition be probabilistic, possessing a component of randomness; if this were not the case, the adversary could simply compute the deterministic encryption of m_0 and m_1 and compare these encryptions with the returned ciphertext c to successfully guess the oracle's choice. Semantically secure encryption algorithms include Goldwasser-Micali, El Gamal and Paillier. These schemes are considered provably secure, as their semantic security can be reduced to solving some hard mathematical problem (e.g., Decisional Diffie-Hellman or the Quadratic Residuosity Problem). Other, semantically insecure algorithms such as RSA, can be made semantically secure (under stronger assumptions) through the use of random encryption padding schemes such as Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP).

Barris did not style the 1966 Batmobile, although his company built it. Early history George and his brother Sam (1924‚Äì1967) were born in Chicago in the 1920s. Barris was three years old when their father, a Greek immigrant from Chios, sent the brothers to live with an uncle and his wife in Roseville, California, following the death of their mother. By age 7, Barris was making models of cars employing balsa wood and modifying their design and appearance with careful attention to details so his entries won contests sponsored by hobby shops. The brothers worked at the Greek restaurant owned by their family, and were given a 1925 Buick for their help. Although it was not in good shape, they swiftly restored it to running condition, and began to experiment with changing its appearance. This became the first Barris Brothers custom car. They sold it at a profit to buy another project vehicle. Before George had graduated from high school, demand for their work was growing, and they had created a club for owners of custom vehicles, called the Kustoms Car Club. This was the first use of the spelling \\"kustom\\", which would become associated with Barris. Barris attended San Juan High School and \\"rushed to sweep floors at a local auto body shop as soon as school let out\\". Barris resisted his family's desire for him to work at its Greek restaurant in a Sacramento suburb. He moved to Los Angeles after turning 18 years old to \\"become part of the emerging teen car culture\\" and opened the \\"Barris Custom Shop\\" on Imperial Highway in Bell, California. Sam entered the Navy during World War II. Sam joined George in Los Angeles after being discharged. The two built their \\"kustom\\" designs for private buyers, and George also built and raced his own cars briefly. These activities brought them to the attention of the movie industry, and they were soon asked to create cars both for personal use by the studio executives and stars and as props for films, their first being used in 1958's High School Confidential. They also made the acquaintance of Robert E. Petersen, founder of Hot Rod and Motor Trend magazines and, much later, of the Petersen Auto Museum. His car shows further publicized the Barris style, as did the car customizing how-to articles George wrote and Petersen published. Custom cars and early popularity Hudson In 1951, Sam had customized a new Mercury coupe for himself, and a customer who saw it ordered a similar car. This vehicle, known as the Hirohata Merc for its owner, was shown at the 1952 General Motors Motorama auto show and was so popular it overshadowed the best work of Detroit's top designers. It also established the early 1950s Mercury as a popular basis for custom car design. In addition, Sam built Ala Kart, a 1929 Ford Model A roadster pickup. After taking two AMBR (America's Most Beautiful Roadster) wins in a row, the car made numerous film and television appearances, usually in the background of diner scenes. Sam decided to leave the business in the 1950s, but George had married and he credited his wife Shirley with major assistance in promoting the company, which eventually became Barris Kustom Industries. It began to license its designs to model car manufacturers such as Aurora, Revell, MPC, and AMT, which spread the Barris name into every hobby, department, and discount store in the United States and also into the minds of millions of eager model builders. In the early 1960s, Barris, along with other well-known customizers (Gene Winfield, Dean Jeffries and the Alexander Brothers) reworked production cars for Ford's \\"Custom Car Caravan\\" and \\"Lincoln/Mercury's Caravan of Stars\\". The traveling exhibits were designed to appeal to younger car buyers, both current and future. Barris also used the body of Pulsator (designed by Nye Frank) on his snowmobile dragster show car Ice Kutter.Taylor, Thom. \\"Pulsator Twin Engine Dragster\\", in \\"Beauty Beyond the Twilight Zone\\", p.36. Barris is the subject of the title story in writer Tom Wolfe's first collection of essays The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine- Flake Streamline Baby. Auto customizing for films and celebrities The Batmobile as seen in the 1960s Batman TV series. Photo by Jennifer Graylock According to Barris, some of his first film work consisted of making soft aluminum fenders for a Ford police car that crashes into the rear of a Mercedes Benz convertible driven by Cary Grant's character in North by Northwest. The idea was to give the collision a comedic quality while also preventing serious damage to the expensive Mercedes. He also built and supplied cars for the 1958 film High School Confidential and loaned some of his customs for the \\"future\\" scenes in the 1960 film adaptation of H. G. Wells' The Time Machine. Other Barris-built film cars included a modified Dodge Charger for Thunder Alley, a Plymouth Barracuda for Fireball 500, the futuristic Supervan for a film of the same name, a gadget-filled Mercury station wagon for The Silencers, and a sinister rework of a Lincoln Continental Mark III for The Car. In the 1960s, the Barris firm became heavily involved in vehicle design for television production. At the beginning of the decade, Barris, who loved extravagant design, had purchased the Lincoln Futura, a concept car of the mid-1950s which had been built by Ghia of Italy. It remained in his collection for several years, until he was rather unexpectedly asked by ABC Television to create a signature vehicle for their Batman television series. Time was very short, as filming would begin in a few weeks, leaving insufficient time for a new design from scratch. Instead, Barris decided the Futura was a perfect base on which to create the Batmobile. Barris hired custom builder Gene Cushenberry to modify the car, which was ready in three weeks. The show was a hit, and the car gained notoriety for Barris. He retained ownership of the Batmobile until an auction on January 19, 2013, when Barris sold it for $4,620,000. This same car went on sale on JamesEdition in July 2016 and includes a batcycle as well. Other television cars built by Barris Kustom Industries include the Munster Koach and casket turned dragster (the \\"Drag-U-La\\") for The Munsters, an Oldsmobile Toronado turned into a roadster used in the first season of Mannix, a 1921 Oldsmobile touring car turned into a truck for The Beverly Hillbillies, the fictional \\"1928 Porter\\" for the NBC comedy My Mother the Car, Updated KITTs for later seasons of Knight Rider and replicas of 1914 Stutz Bearcats for Bearcats!. George Barris was responsible for the frame of the original Batmobile and other famous customized automobiles he created for various celebrities. Barris created a customized gold Rolls Royce for actress Zsa Zsa Gabor. The golden Rolls-Royce displayed the detailed work of Barris and included hand-etched window glass by Robb Rich showing butterflies, roses, and hummingbirds. Barris built many novelty vehicles for other celebrities; these include golf carts for Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Ann-Margret, Glen Campbell, and Elton John; and 25 modified Mini Mokes for a record company contest involving the Beach Boys. He would also modify cars for Hollywood stars and others. Some examples include a Cadillac limousine for Elvis Presley, custom Pontiac station wagons for John Wayne, a Cadillac Eldorado turned into a station wagon for Dean Martin. and a pair of \\"his & hers\\" 1966 Ford Mustang convertibles for Sonny and Cher. With the cooperation of American Motors, in 1969 he modified an AMX coupe into the AMX-400 show car which was later used in a 1972 episode of Banacek. In the 1990s NASA contacted Barris to discuss an original Moonscope vehicle he designed back in 1966 and became a successful plastic car model for collectors. Its 6-wheel spider suspension and large wedged tires caught the attention of engineers preparing for the Martian rovers and eventual human Mars vehicles. Edward Lozzi, former White House Press Advance Office staffer and spokesperson for George Barris, who would later become a media consultant to Apollo Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, negotiated the request with NASA and stated, \\" NASA contacted my office and requested the original designs of the Moonscope from Barris. They revealed they were interested in studying the Barris designs for the Martian vehicles. Barris gave them permission and NASA sent people to meet with him\\". Between 2002 and 2006, Barris also designed two custom Cadillac hearses for episodes of the cable television series Monster Garage. Barris' company often builds replicas of non-Barris designed vehicles from other TV series, including The Monkees Monkeemobile, Starsky & Hutch (Ford Torino, Power Rangers (Turbo Vehicles) and Knight Rider KITT. Barris also designed and built the \\"Wagon Queen Family Truckster\\", based on a 1979 Ford Country Squire station wagon, for the 1983 film National Lampoon's Vacation. Later career George Barris signing autographs at the 2008 SEMA show in Las Vegas, seated next to \\"Miss Hurst Shifter\\" Linda Vaughn In 2005 The New York Times had Barris customize a Toyota Prius, one of the most popular cars in the U.S. yet according to the Times, one of the most unattractive. The budget was $10,000, and a further condition was not to chop the body or interfere with the hybrid mechanics in any way. In April 2010, the special George Barris design edition of the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro Spirit was introduced to the public for the first time at a VIP media event at Community Chevrolet, one of the largest Chevrolet dealerships in the United States. On November 29, 2012, Barris Kustom and George Barris announced the sale of the Number 1 Batmobile at the Barrett-Jackson car show and auction held in Scottsdale, Arizona. The world-famous vehicle went on the auction block, on January 19, 2013. The final sale price, after a very intense bidding war, was $4.6 million to car collector Rick Champagne from Arizona. Back to the Future controversy Over a decade after the release of Back to the Future Part III, one of the DeLorean time machine stunt cars used in the film was sent to Barris for restoration purposes to be put on display at the Petersen Auto Museum in Los Angeles. The car was returned to Universal Studios in 2003. Barris later purchased a stock DeLorean and converted it into a replica of the Back to the Future DeLorean, which he used to promote himself and his company. While Barris never officially stated that he had anything to do with the Back to the Future films, he did like to indulge in stating that he had built a Back to the Future DeLorean, but never disclosed that it was a replica car. In 2007, Universal Studios officials sent Barris a cease and desist order demanding that he never again make misrepresentations regarding any involvement with the Back to the Future films. They called upon Barris to remove images of the flying DeLorean from his company's website and restrict his display of replicas of the gull-wing car used by Michael J. Fox in the popular 1985 movie and its sequels. Back to the Future writer/producer Bob Gale went on record stating that \\"George Barris had absolutely nothing to do with the design or construction of the DeLorean time travel vehicle.‚Äù The DeLorean was designed on paper by Ron Cobb and Andrew Probert, and it was built under the supervision of special effects supervisor Kevin Pike and construction coordinator Michael Scheffe.\\" Personal life and death Barris was married to Shirley Nahas from 1958 until her death in 2001. They had two children. He died on November 5, 2015, in his sleep at his home in Encino, Los Angeles, California, fifteen days away from his 90th birthday.

It is one of the brightest globulars that is visible in the night sky. The brightest stars are 11th magnitude, with hundreds of stars bright enough to resolve with an 8\\" telescope.Burnham's Celestial Handbook, vol.3, p.1594-1599 M22 is located just south of the Ecliptic, and northwest of Lambda Sagittarii (Kaus Borealis), the northernmost star of the \\"Teapot\\" asterism. M22 was one of the first globulars to be discovered, on August 26, 1665 by Abraham Ihle and it was included in Charles Messier's catalog of comet-like objects on June 5, 1764. It was one of the first globular clusters to be carefully studied first by Harlow Shapley in 1930. He discovered roughly 70,000 stars and found it had a dense core. Then Halton Arp and William G. Melbourne continued studies in 1959. Because of the large color spread of its red giant branch (RGB) sequence, which is similar to that observed in Omega Centauri, it became the object of intense scrutiny starting in 1977 with James E. Hesser et al. M22 is one of the nearer globular clusters to Earth at a distance of about 10,600 light-years away. It spans 32' on the sky which translates to a spatial diameter of 99 ¬± 9 light-years. 32 variable stars have been recorded in M22. It is projected in front of the galactic bulge and is therefore useful for its microlensing effect on the background stars in the bulge. Despite its relative proximity to us, this metal-poor cluster's light is limited by dust extinction, giving it an apparent magnitude of 5.5 making it the brightest globular cluster visible from mid-northern latitudes (e.g. Europe and most of North America). However, due to its southerly declination, M22 never rises high in the sky and so appears less impressive to northern hemisphere observers than other summer sky globulars such as M13 and M5. M22 is very unusual in that it is one of only four globulars (the others being M15, NGC 6441 and Palomar 6) that are known to contain a planetary nebula. It was discovered using the IRAS satellite by Fred Gillett et al.,in 1986 as a pointlike source (IRAS 18333-2357) and subsequently identified as a planetary nebula in 1989 by Gillett et al. The planetary nebula's central star is a blue star. The planetary nebula (designated GJJC1) is estimated to be a mere ~6,000 years old. Two black holes of between 10 and 20 solar masses each have been discovered, initially with the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico, and corroborated by the Chandra X-ray telescope, in 2012. Their detection implies that gravitational ejection of black holes from clusters is not as efficient as was previously thought, and leads to estimates of a total 5 to 100 black holes within M22. Interactions between stars and black holes could explain the unusually large core of the cluster.

Its current members are JuJu and Psycho Les. JuJu (born Jerry Tineo on December 14, 1968) is a Dominican American from Corona and Psycho Les (born Lester Fernandez on April 10, 1970) is a Colombian American from Jackson Heights. The Beatnuts are the only Latino members of the Native Tongues collective. Although only peripheral members, they are routinely acknowledged by Q-Tip. The Beatnuts were originally a trio before Fashion (born Berntony Smalls on January 13, 1970), now known as Al' Tariq, left the group to start a solo career. V.I.C. (Groove Merchantz, Ghetto Pros) was also a member of The Beatnuts' production team for a while. History =Origins= JuJu and Psycho Les grew up in different communities in Queens, New York. Psycho Les started producing beats and DJing at age 15 under aliases including DJ Les Jams and DJ Incredible. At a high school in Flushing, Queens, a friend DJ Loco Moe introduced Les to fellow producer JuJu. While crate digging, both Beatnuts ran into Afrika Baby Bam from the Jungle Brothers. Afrika introduced them to Native Tongues members including De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest and the Jungle Brothers. At this time, JuJu and Psycho Les were DJing parties under the alias Beat Kings. The Jungle Brothers claimed that they were not kings, but rather two nuts for their comical nature and the fact that they were crazy enough to carry hundreds of records to every show they played. They thus changed their name and \\"it stuck.\\" The two Beatnuts members later met up with rapper Kool Fashion. =Early production work= The Beatnuts entered the recording industry in 1990 producing two tracks for the British alternative hip hop/electronica group Stereo MCs as well as a song for British rapper Monie Love. Over the next two years, they produced songs for rappers including Common, Pete Nice & DJ Richie Rich and Kurious, as well as a full album for Chi-Ali. As of 1992, JuJu had not appeared on a record, but fellow Beatnuts rappers Fashion and Psycho Les appeared on tracks that he produced. In 1993, The Beatnuts produced more songs for the artists they had previously collaborated with as well as Fat Joe, Supr√™me NTM and Da Youngsta's. At the same time, The Beatnuts made their name as remix specialists by remixing songs for MC Lyte, Da Lench Mob, Naughty by Nature, Jomanda and others. =Debut albums= The Beatnuts' early production work earned them a record deal with Combat Records in 1992. The Beatnuts planned on releasing a \\"mini-LP\\" through that label, but its release was delayed when Kool Fashion was sentenced to six months of jail for drug convictions.Allmusic. All Music Guide to Hip-Hop: The Definitive Guide to Rap & Hip-Hop, Backbeat Books (2003). . After Fashion completed his sentence, The Beatnuts left Combat Records and signed deals with Violator Management and Relativity Records. On April 6, 1993, The Beatnuts released their debut album, Intoxicated Demons: The EP, through their new label. It featured 11 songs, including the two singles \\"Reign of the Tec\\" and \\"No Equal\\". The album was characterized by its hedonistic party-style lyrics and sample-heavy jazz beats. It was a critical success receiving favorable reviews by Allmusic, The Source and Entertainment Weekly. Intoxicated Demons was followed in 1994 with the eponymous full-length album The Beatnuts: Street Level. Street Level followed its preceding EP in style, but slightly surpassed its commercial success by charting on the Billboard 200. It featured two singles, \\"Props Over Here\\" and \\"Hit Me with That\\", neither of which were commercial hits. Street Level was the last Beatnuts album released before Fashion left the group to become a devout Muslim and solo artist under the alias Al' Tariq. He left The Beatnuts on good terms and collaborated with his former group on future albums. =Commercial breakthroughs= The Beatnuts did not follow up their 1994 album until releasing Stone Crazy in 1997. Although it contained \\"Off the Books\\", a single that charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and featured a standout performance by Big Pun, the album was not a critical success. Leo Stanley of Allmusic attributed its mediocre reception to its lack of energy‚Äînot its \\"jazz-inflected rhythms and hardcore rhyming\\". Chris Ryan of Rolling Stone conceded that the album was still \\"something of a breakthrough\\" for The Beatnuts in spite of itself. Two weeks after the release of Stone Crazy, The Beatnuts released Hydra Beats, Vol. 5, a small-scale instrumental album. Vol. 5 was one album in a series of vinyl instrumental albums released by underground label Hydra Entertainment. 1998 saw the release of The Spot, a remix EP that revamped songs from the first three non-instrumental Beatnuts albums. It additionally featured sequels to older Beatnuts tracks and one new song, \\"Treat$\\". It was released in anticipation of 1999's A Musical Massacre, The Beatnuts' most commercially and critically successful album. A Musical Massacre reached #35 on the Billboard 200 due to its hit single \\"Watch Out Now\\". The album is hailed for its \\"eclectic\\" and \\"textured\\" beats as well as its \\"rough, rugged, and raunchy\\" lyrics with slightly more content variation than past releases. After Sony released The Beatnuts's first hits compilation, 1999's World Famous Classics, The Beatnuts did not record another album until 2001's Take It or Squeeze It. Their 2001 album contained two slightly popular singles, \\"No Escapin' This\\" and \\"Let's Git Doe\\", but was unable to match the commercial or critical success of A Musical Massacre. Reviews by both Allmusic and Rolling Stone claimed that Take It or Squeeze It had a mix of inventive production and clich√©d gangster rhymes. =Return to underground= The Beatnuts' official logo. It is inspired by a similar symbol on the cover art of Hank Mobley's The Turnaround.Emery, Andrew. The Book of Hip Hop Cover Art, Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. (2004). . In November 2001, it was announced that Loud Recordswhose father label Relativity Records had released all Beatnuts albums since their 1993 debuthad cut ties with The Beatnuts. The decision was followed by the release of two greatest hits: 2001's Beatnuts Forever and 2002's Classic Nuts, Vol. 1. While The Beatnuts were free agents, a rumor surfaced that JuJu and Psycho Les were going to collaborate with Al' Tariq under the group alias 'Intoxicated Demons'. The Beatnuts did not reunite with Al Tariq, but instead signed with the underground label LandSpeed Records. In 2002, they released The Originators, a commercial failure that did not reach the Billboard 200 or contain charting singles. The album was still a critical success because of its catchy hooks and creative beats. Steve Juon of RapReviews.com remarked on the correlation between The Beatnuts' critical and commercial success: > If they are less known and don't sell as well being on an indie imprint like > LandSpeed Records, it will still be worth it if the increased quality of > their beats and rhymes remain this high. Instead of remaining on LandSpeed Records, The Beatnuts signed to Penalty Recordings before releasing their 2004 album Milk Me. Although Penalty was also an underground label, Milk Me was still able to scrape the bottom of the Billboard 200. The album was almost unanimously held to be solid. Nonetheless, three singles and an Akon guest appearance did not propel the album to the commercial success of prior Beatnuts albums. \\"Watch Out Now\\" controversy Milk Me contained the song \\"Confused Rappers\\", a track that dissed Jennifer Lopez for allegedly stealing the beat from The Beatnuts' \\"Watch Out Now\\" on her 2002 hit \\"Jenny from the Block\\". The song criticizes Lopez's singing ability and looks, but ultimately criticizes the track's producers, Trackmasters and Cory Rooney, for allegedly stealing the beat. Although The Beatnuts did eventually receive royalties, Psycho Les is still critical of the track's producers. The beats on both \\"Watch Out Now\\" and \\"Jenny from the Block\\" sample the Enoch Light cover of \\"Hi-Jack\\" by Fernando Arbex of the Spanish group Barrab√°s. Barrab√°s created the original drum and bass lines, with the flute transposition of the melodic loop (the famous sample in the Beatnuts and Jennifer Lopez tracks) introduced in the Herbie Mann and Enoch Light covers. =Recent endeavors= In March 2007, Psycho Les released his debut solo album Psycho Therapy (The Soundtrack) on Pit Fight Records. Psycho Les additionally joined with Al Tariq and Problemz to form the group Big City. In June, they released The City Never Sleeps on Nature Sounds. Later that year, The Beatnuts had a track included on the Official Joints mixtape, a collection of previously unreleased songs by NYC rappers. In December, JuJu was arrested in Stockholm, Sweden for an alleged assault. He was detained for 36 hours for a \\"minor assault\\" after performing a concert. On September 30, 2008, Pit Fight Records released U.F.O. Files, a compilation of previously unreleased Beatnuts songs. July 24, 2009, The Beatnuts performed with Slick Rick and Rahzel at the Roseland Theater in Portland, Oregon. Presented by Global Market Productions the show included all elements of hip hop: beat boxing, break dancing, DJing, MC battles and graffiti art. In October 2009, Deez Nuts, a semi-autobiographical theatre production conceived by Sacha Jenkins and starring The Beatnuts ran for 3 nights at the Ohio Theatre as part of the New York Hip-Hop Theater Festival. The Beatnuts recently partnered with the West Coast Hip hop group Tha Alkaholiks to make a super crew known as the Liknuts and are currently touring. Both JuJu and Psycho Les contributed beats for Tony Touch's The Piece Maker 3: Return of the 50 MC's,Tony Touch - The Piece Maker Volume 3: Return of The 50 MC's Style The Beatnuts are known for their sample-heavy beats and explicit party-ready lyrics. In early records, the beats had a jazz and funk-influenced sound, but later songs were influenced by Latin music. Critics have commented that The Beatnuts have consistently good beats, but lack in terms of lyrics. JuJu addressed this in a 2004 interview: Their production is noted as some of the most accomplished, if unheralded, in all of hip hop, often intricately detailed (as in their finely honed work for Mos Def on two tracks from Black on Both Sides) but more regularly barnstorming, club-friendly, flourish-laden party music. The Beatnuts are noted for being unabashedly, bullishly ribald and in-your-face performers. Recent Beatnuts albums are characterized by more Latin influences.

Johannes de Sacrobosco, also written Ioannis de Sacro Bosco ( 1195 ‚Äì 1256), was a scholar, monk and astronomer who was a teacher at the University of Paris. He wrote a short introduction to the Hindu-Arabic numeral system which became the most widely read introduction to that subject in the later medieval centuries (judging from the number of manuscript copies that survive today).\\"The Spread of the [Hindu‚ÄìArabic Numerals in Europe\\"] in The Hindu‚ÄìArabic Numerals, by D. E. Smith and L. C. Karpinski, 1911, pages 58‚Äì59 and 134‚Äì135. He also wrote a short astronomy textbook, Tractatus de Sphaera, which was widely read and influential in Europe during the later medieval centuries as an introduction to astronomy. In his longest and most original book, Sacrobosco correctly described the defects of the then-used Julian calendar, and, three centuries before its implementation, recommended a solution much like the modern Gregorian calendar. Very little is known about the education and biography of Sacrobosco. For one thing, his year of death has been guessed at 1236, 1244, and 1256, each of which is plausible and each lacking adequate evidence. Place of birth The country in which he was born is uncertain. In the year 1271 Robertus Anglicus stated that Sacrobosco was born in England.Johannes de Sacrobosco biography by the University of Cambridge. That could be true, yet there is neither good supporting nor good contradicting evidence for it. On the basis of the testimony of someone writing in year 1271, a birthplace in England can be taken as having more likelihood than other possibilities. Among other possibilities, several different tenuous efforts have been made to figure out his birthplace from his appellative de Sacrobosco. Long after his death, Johannes de Sacrobosco was called and sometimes still is called by the name John of Holywood or John of Holybush, a name which was constructed by post-hoc reverse translation of the Latin sacro bosco, where sacro = \\"holy\\" (sacred), and bosco = \\"wood\\". \\"Sacrobosco\\" as such is an unknown town or region. One traditional report, that he was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, is due to a 16th-century author, John Leland,Pedersen, \\"In Quest of Sacrobosco\\" and was discredited by William Camden: Halifax means 'holy hair', not 'holy wood'. Sacrobosco has been identified, by Thomas Dempster, with an Augustinian canon from Holywood Abbey, Nithsdale (in fact a Premonstratensian house); which would be a reason for imagining him to have been born in Scotland.Johannes de Sacrobosco biography by the University of St. Andrews He is also claimed by Holywood, County Down, this being based on a suggestion of Richard Stanihurst. However, Pederson attributes this assertion to Holywood being known to Stanihurst. Pederson's book mentioned that in 1639 James Ware assumed that the birthplace of Sacrobosco was near Dublin. Stanihurst and even Pederson were probably unaware that the seat of the Sacrobosco/Hollywood family in Ireland was in Artane, a suburb of Dublin (\\"The History of the County of Dublin\\" by John D'Alton published in 1838). Local historical records in Ireland seem to indicate that Sacrobosco was a member of the Artane Hollywoods and was born in Artane Castle.Parish of Holywood A similar claim is made for Holywood, County Wicklow, though there is no known historical document which supports this. Life The story that he was educated at the University of Oxford is no more documented than the stories on his place of birth. According to a seventeenth-century account, he arrived at the University of Paris on 5 June 1221, but whether as an arts student or as a licentiate (one having a Master of Arts degree from another university and thus qualified to teach) is unclear. In due course, he began to teach the mathematical disciplines at the University of Paris. The year of his death is uncertain, with evidence supporting the years 1234, 1236, 1244, and 1256. The inscription marking his burial place in the monastery of Saint-Mathurin in Paris described him as a computist, one who was an expert on the calculation of Easter. :De Sacrobosco qui computista Joannes :Tempora discrevit, iacet hic a tempore raptus. :Tempora qui sequeris, memor esto quod morieris. :Si miser es, plora: miserans pro me procor ora. Tractatus de Sphaera Line engraving done in year 1584. It pretends to depict Johannes de Sacrobosco. About 1230, his best-known work, Tractatus de Sphaera (On the Sphere of the World) was published. In this book, Sacrobosco gives a readable account of the Ptolemaic universe. Ptolemy's (updated) Almagest had been translated into Latin in 1175 by Gerard of Cremona from the Arabic translation held in Toledo and copies had quickly found their way to Paris. In addition Sacrobosco was able to draw on translations of the Arabic astronomers Thabit ibn Qurra, al-Biruni, al-Urdi and al-Fargani. Sacrobosco's sphere was the imaginary backdrop of the stars in the sky, which was the meaning of the word 'world' at that time, not the earth as we know it. Though principally about the heavens it also contains a clear description of the Earth as a sphere, in the first chapter. The Sphere was required reading by students in all Western European universities for the next four centuries. Algorismus Sacrobosco's Algorismus aka De Arte Numerandi is thought to have been his first work, and the date is estimated at about 1225, and before 1230. The Hindu‚ÄìArabic methods of numerical calculation had arrived in Latin Europe during the previous fifty years but had not been disseminated on a wide scale. Sacrobosco's Algorismus was the first text to introduce Hindu‚ÄìArabic numerals and procedures into the European university curriculum. De Anni Ratione What Sacrobosco may be most famous for is his criticism of the Julian calendar. In his book on computus, entitled in Latin De Anni Ratione (English: On reckoning the years), dated circa 1235, he maintained that the Julian calendar had accumulated an error of ten days and that some correction was needed. The Julian calendar was instituted in the 1st century BC. The Julian calendar year contained 365.25 days, with the 0.25 day provided for by a Leap year once every fourth year. However, the more precise length of a solar year is about 365.2422 days. The imprecise 365.25 days had resulted in an accumulated error of about 10 days by the 13th century. Sacrobosco made no proposal on how to get rid of the accumulated error. But looking to the future, he proposed to leave one day out of the calendar every 288 years to prevent continuing error. Sacrobosco's data were not quite as accurate as those of the Alfonsine tables which were produced a few decades later in the 1270s based on the Arabic Tables of Toledo. The astronomer Campanus of Novara in 1268 did similar work, again making use of Arabic astronomy sources. Sacrobosco too was influenced by Arabic astronomical sources, but not the same sources, and there is no indication in his writings that he could read Arabic.

Born in Berlin, Ontario, (the city would change its name to Kitchener in 1916), she was educated at the Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate Institute and the University of Toronto.page 174, Great Women Mystery Writers, 2nd Ed. by Elizabeth Blakesley Lindsay, 2007, publ. Greenwood Press, She moved to the United States after marrying Kenneth Millar (better known under the pen name Ross Macdonald). They resided for decades in the city of Santa Barbara, which was often used as a locale in her later novels under the pseudonyms of San Felice or Santa Felicia. The Millars had a daughter, Linda.Flash From the Past: Famous 20th century private eye is rooted in Kitchener July 10, 2020 Styles and themes Millar's books are distinguished by depth of characterization. Often we are shown the rather complex interior lives of the people in her books, with issues of class, insecurity, failed ambitions, loneliness or existential isolation or paranoia often being explored. Unusual people, mild societal misfits or people who don't quite fit into their surroundings are given much interior detail. In some of the books (for example in The Iron Gates) we are given insight into what it feels like to be losing touch with reality and evolving into madness. In general, she is a writer of both expressive description and economy, often ambitious in conveying the sociological context of the stories. Millar often delivers \\"surprise endings,\\" but the details that would allow the solution of the surprise have usually been subtly included, in the best genre tradition. Her books focus on subtleties of human interaction and rich psychological detail of individual characters as much as on plot. Millar was a pioneer in writing about the psychology of women. Even as early as the '40s and '50s, her books have a mature and matter-of-fact view of class distinctions, sexual freedom and frustration, and the ambivalence of moral codes depending on a character's economic circumstances. Read against the backdrop of Production Code-era movies of the time, they remind us that life as lived in the '40s and '50s was not as black-and-white morally as Hollywood would have us believe. Many websites cite her as working as a screenwriter for Warner Brothers just after World War II, but no further details are given as to what she may have worked on, even on imdb.com. Around that time, Warners bought the option on her novel The Iron Gates, with its portrait of a woman descending into madness, but reportedly Bette Davis and other prominent Warner Brothers actresses ultimately turned it down because the memorable protagonist is missing for the last third of the story. The film was never produced. In the early '60s, two of her novels (Beast in View and Rose's Last Summer, the latter starred Mary Astor) were adapted for the anthology TV series Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Thriller. While she was not known for any one recurring detective (unlike her husband, whose constant gumshoe was Lew Archer), she occasionally used a detective character for more than one novel. Among her occasional ongoing sleuths were Canadians Dr. Paul Prye (her first invention, in the earliest books) and Inspector Sands (a quiet, unassuming Canadian police inspector who might be the most endearing of her recurring inventions). In the California years, a few books featured either Joe Quinn, a rather down- on-his-luck private eye, or Tom Aragon, a young, Hispanic lawyer. Most of Millar's books are still in print in America. Starting in 2016, Soho Syndicate has published a large selection of omnibus re-issues grouped by theme. Many are available as single ebooks. Awards and recognition In 1956, Millar won the Edgar Allan Poe Awards, Best Novel award for Beast in View. In 1965 she was awarded the Woman of the Year Award by the Los Angeles Times. In 1983, she was awarded the Grand Master Award by the Mystery Writers of America in recognition of her lifetime achievements. In 1987, critic and mystery writer H.R.F Keating included Millar's Beast In View in his Crime & Mystery: The 100 Best Books. He wrote: > \\"Margaret Millar is surely one of late twentieth-century crime fiction's > best writers, in the sense that the actual writing in her books, the prose, > is of superb quality.

It stars Roger Livesey, Deborah Kerr and Anton Walbrook. The title derives from the satirical Colonel Blimp comic strip by David Low, but the story itself is original. The film is renowned for its Technicolor cinematography.  Plot  Major-General Clive Wynne-Candy (Roger Livesey) is a senior commander in the Home Guard during the Second World War. Before a training exercise, he is \\"captured\\" in a Turkish bath by soldiers led by Lieutenant \\"Spud\\" Wilson, who has struck pre-emptively. He ignores Candy's outraged protests that \\"War starts at midnight!\\" They scuffle and fall into a bathing pool. An extended flashback ensues. Boer War In 1902, Lieutenant Candy is on leave from the Boer War. He receives a letter from Edith Hunter (Deborah Kerr), who is working in Berlin. She complains that a German named Kaunitz is spreading anti-British propaganda, and she wants the British embassy to intervene. When Candy brings this to his superiors' attention, they refuse him permission to go to Berlin, but he goes anyway. In Berlin, Candy and Edith go to a caf√©, where he confronts Kaunitz. Provoked, Candy inadvertently insults the Imperial German Army officer corps. The Germans insist he fight a duel with an officer chosen by lot: Theo Kretschmar- Schuldorff (Anton Walbrook). Candy and Theo become friends while recuperating from their wounds in the same nursing home. Edith visits them regularly and, although it is implied that she has feelings for Clive,This is suggested by Michael Powell in the DVD commentary track. she becomes engaged to Theo. Candy is delighted, but soon realises that he loves her himself. First World War In November 1918 Candy, now a brigadier general, believes that the Allies won the First World War because \\"right is might\\". While in France, he meets nurse Barbara Wynne (Kerr again). She bears a striking resemblance to Edith. Back in England, he courts and marries her despite their twenty-year age difference. In July 1919 Candy tracks Theo down at a prisoner of war camp in Derbyshire. Candy greets him as if nothing has changed, but Theo snubs him. On 26 August about to be repatriated to Germany, Theo apologises and accepts an invitation to Clive's house. He remains sceptical that his country will be treated fairly. Barbara dies in August 1926, and Candy retires in 1935. Second World War In November 1939, Theo relates to a British Immigration official how he was estranged from his children when they became Nazis. Before the war, he refused to move to England when Edith wanted to; by the time he was ready, she had died. Candy vouches for Theo. Candy reveals to Theo that he loved Edith and only realised it after it was too late. He admits that he never got over it. Theo meets Candy's MTC driver, Angela \\"Johnny\\" Cannon (Kerr again), personally chosen by the Englishman; Theo is struck by her resemblance to Barbara and Edith. Candy, restored to the active list, is to give a BBC radio talk regarding the retreat from Dunkirk. Candy plans to say he would rather lose the war than win it using the methods employed by the Nazis: his talk is cancelled. Theo urges his friend to accept the need to fight and win by whatever means are necessary, because the consequences of losing are so dire. Candy is again retired, but, at Theo's and Angela's urging, turns his energy to the Home Guard. Candy is instrumental in building up the Home Guard. His house is bombed in the Blitz and replaced by an emergency water supply cistern. He moves to his club, where he relaxes in a Turkish bath before a training exercise he has arranged. The brash young lieutenant who captures Candy is Angela's boyfriend, who used her to learn about Candy's plans and location. She tries to warn Candy, but is too late. Theo and Angela find Candy sitting across the street from where his house stood. He recalls that after being given a severe dressing down by his superior for causing the diplomatic incident, he declined the man's invitation to dinner, and often regretted doing so. He tells Angela to invite her boyfriend to dine with him. Years before, Clive promised Barbara that he would \\"never change\\" until his house was flooded and \\"this is a lake\\". Seeing the cistern, he realises that \\"here is the lake and I still haven't changed\\". Candy salutes the new guard as it passes by.  Cast  Cast notes: *Making their second appearance in The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp were director Michael Powell's golden cocker spaniels, Erik and Spangle, who had previously appeared in Contraband (1940), and went on to be seen in the Powell and Pressburger films I Know Where I'm Going! (1945) and A Matter of Life and Death (US: Stairway to Heaven, 1946).,  Production  According to the directors, the idea for the film did not come from the newspaper comic strip by David Low but from a scene cut from their previous film, One of Our Aircraft Is Missing, in which an elderly member of the crew tells a younger one, \\"You don't know what it's like to be old.\\" Powell has stated that the idea was actually suggested by David Lean (then an editor) who, when removing the scene from the film, mentioned that the premise of the conversation was worthy of a film in its own right.Michael Powell, commentary on the Criterion Collection Laserdisc (also available on the Criterion DVD) Powell wanted Laurence Olivier (who had previously appeared in Powell and Pressburger's 49th Parallel and The Volunteer) to play Candy. However, the Ministry of Information refused to release Olivier‚Äîwho was serving in the Fleet Air Arm‚Äîfrom active service, telling Powell and Pressburger, \\"...we advise you not to make it and you can't have Laurence Olivier because he's in the Fleet Air Arm and we're not going to release him to play your Colonel Blimp\\". Powell wanted Wendy Hiller to play Kerr's parts but she pulled out due to pregnancy. The character of Frau von Kalteneck, a friend of Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff, was played by Roger Livesey's wife Ursula Jeans. Although they often appeared on stage together, this was their only appearance together in a film. Further problems were caused by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who, prompted by objections from James Grigg, his secretary of state for war, sent a memo suggesting the production be stopped. Grigg warned that the public's belief in the \\"Blimp conception of the Army officer\\" would be given \\"a new lease of life\\". After Ministry of Information and War Office officials had viewed a rough cut, objections were withdrawn in May 1943. Churchill's disapproval remained, however, and at his insistence an export ban, much exploited in advertising by the British distributors, remained in place until August of that year. The film was shot in four months at Denham Film Studios and on location in and around London, and at Denton Hall in Yorkshire. Filming was made difficult by the wartime shortages and by Churchill's objections leading to a ban on the production crew having access to any military personnel or equipment. But they still managed to \\"find\\" quite a few Army vehicles and plenty of uniforms. Michael Powell once said of The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp that it is At other times he also pointed out that the designer was German, and the leads included Austrian and Scottish actors. The military advisor for the film was Lieutenant General Sir Douglas Brownrigg (1886‚Äì1946) whose own career was rather similar to Wynne-Candy's, as he had served with distinction in the First World War, was retired after Dunkirk and then took a senior role in the Home Guard.  Original release and contemporary reception  The film was released in the UK in 1943. The premi√®re, organised by Lady Margaret Alexander, took place on 10 June at the Odeon cinema, Leicester Square, London, with all proceeds donated to the Odeon Services and Seamen's Fund. The film was heavily attacked on release mainly because of its sympathetic presentation of a German officer, albeit an anti- Nazi one, who is more down-to-earth and realistic than the central British character. Sympathetic German characters had previously appeared in the films of Powell and Pressburger, for example The Spy in Black and 49th Parallel, the latter of which was also made during the war. The film provoked an extremist pamphlet, The Shame and Disgrace of Colonel Blimp, by \\"right-wing sociologists E. W. and M. M. Robson\\", members of the obscure Sidneyan Society, which proclaimed it \\"A highly elaborate, flashy, flabby and costly film, the most disgraceful production that has ever emanated from a British film studio.\\" The film was the third most popular movie at the British box office in 1943, after In Which We Serve and Casablanca.Robert Murphy, Realism and Tinsel: Cinema and Society in Britain 1939-48 2003 p 206 Due to the British government's disapproval of the film, it was not released in the United States until 1945 and then in a modified form, as The Adventures of Colonel Blimp or simply Colonel Blimp. The original cut was 163 minutes. It was reduced to a 150-minute version, then later to 90 minutes for television. One of the crucial changes made to the shortened versions was the removal of the film's flashback structure.As may be seen in the shortened version available at some national libraries like the BFI Restorations In 1983, the original cut was restored for a re-release, much to Emeric Pressburger's delight. Pressburger, as affirmed by his grandson Kevin Macdonald on a Carlton Region 2 DVD featurette, considered Blimp the best of his and Powell's works. Nearly thirty years later, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp underwent another restoration similar to that performed on The Red Shoes. The fundraising was spearheaded by Martin Scorsese and his long-time editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, also Michael Powell's widow. Restoration work was completed by the Academy Film Archive in association with the BFI, ITV Studios Global Entertainment Ltd. (the current copyright holders), and The Film Foundation, with funding provided by The Material World Charitable Foundation, the Louis B. Mayer Foundation, Cinema per Roma Foundation, and The Film Foundation. The restored film was shown around the world.  Reputation and analysis  Although the film is strongly pro-British, it is a satire on the British Army, especially its leadership. It suggests that Britain faced the option of following traditional notions of honourable warfare or to \\"fight dirty\\" in the face of such an evil enemy as Nazi Germany.As is shown in the film in Theo's speech to Clive after Clive's broadcast is cancelled There is also a certain similarity between Candy and Churchill and some historians have suggested that Churchill may have wanted the production stopped because he had mistaken the film for a parody of himself (he had himself served in the Boer War and the First World War). Churchill's exact reasons remain unclear, but he was acting only on a description of the planned film from his staff, not on a viewing of the film itself. Since the highly successful re-release of the film in the 1980s, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp has been re-evaluated. The film is praised for its dazzling Technicolor cinematography (which, with later films such as The Red Shoes and Black Narcissus, would arguably become The Archers' greatest legacy), the performances by the lead actors as well as for transforming, in Roger Ebert's words; \\"a blustering, pigheaded caricature into one of the most loved of all movie characters\\". David Mamet has written: \\"My idea of perfection is Roger Livesey (my favorite actor) in The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (my favorite film) about to fight Anton Walbrook (my other favorite actor).\\"David Mamet, Bambi vs. Godzilla, 2007, p. 148 Stephen Fry saw the film as addressing \\"what it means to be English\\", and praised it for the bravery of taking a \\"longer view of history\\" in 1943.Stephen Fry, interviewed by the Daily Telegraph, 2003 Anthony Lane of the New Yorker said in 1995 that the film \\"may be the greatest English film ever made, not least because it looks so closely at the incurable condition of being English\\".Anthony Lane, The New Yorker, 20 March 1995 The film appears in Empires list of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time at number 80.

Raised in the Lost City of the Jedi for the first twelve years of his life, Ken eventually joins the Rebel Alliance, where Luke discovers him. Ken is the son of the mutant Triclops and, therefore, grandson of Emperor Palpatine. * Trioculus is the self-proclaimed son and heir of Palpatine. As his moniker implies, he has three eyes: two in the same place as a normal human and a third on his forehead. He attempts to procure the glove worn on the hand that Darth Vader lost in his duel with Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi. This glove is rumored to bestow great power upon its holder. Trioculus is killed by a droid replica of Princess Leia. * Triclops is Palpatine's illegitimate son, named because of his three eyes. He is sent into solitary exile because the Emperor fears Triclops' potential mastery of the dark side of the Force. During his exile, The Empire administers shock treatment therapies which eventually drove the boy insane, and he is sent an insane asylum. There, he meets the nurse Kendalina, a Jedi Princess, and the two conceive a child. Kendalina is murdered, and their son, Ken, is taken away. Triclops is forced to work for the slave lord Trioculus. After pledging pacifism and his desire to see the Empire's demise, Triclops is taken in by the Alliance. When they learn he was fitted with an implant that transmits images to Imperial Probe droids, they feed him disinformation. Triclops escapes before they can destroy the implant, leaving only an impassioned letter to his son, Ken. * Grand Moff Hissa is an Imperial Moff who plots to take over the reins of the empire by using Trioculus as a puppet dictator. He loses his legs during a scuffle with the Rebellion, in which he falls into a vat of acid; thereafter, he uses a hovering wheelchair to get around. * Supreme Prophet of the Dark Side Kadann is a bearded dwarf who prophesies that the next Emperor would wear the glove of Darth Vader, hence Trioculus' interest in it. Part of Kadann's success as a prophet is due to a network of bribe-payers and other people who help his prophecies come true. In the Dark Side Sourcebook, it is revealed that this Kadann was once a Jedi who was secretly turned to the dark side before the Great Jedi Purge. He pledged his loyalty to Palpatine, and was thus spared and became one of his chief advisors. Kadann foresees the Emperor's death at Endor and tries to warn him; this warning went disregarded, of course. ISBN Information * The Glove of Darth Vader, 1st edition paperback, 1992.

It typically has a or rhythmic time signature, and two or three parts repeating in patterns such as ABAB or ABCAC. Its lyrics are marked by nostalgia, sadness, and laments for lost love. The typical orchestra has several melodic instruments and is given a distinctive air by the small button accordion called the bandoneon. It has continued to grow in popularity and spread internationally, adding modern elements without replacing the older ones. Among its leading figures are the singer and songwriter Carlos Gardel and composers/performers Francisco Canaro, Juan D'Arienzo, Carlos Di Sarli, Osvaldo Pugliese, and √Åstor Piazzolla. History of tango The origins of tango are unclear because little historical documentation from that era exists. However, in recent years, a few tango aficionados have undertaken a thorough research of that history and so it is less mysterious today than before. It is generally thought that the dance developed in the late 19th century in working-class neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, Argentina and Montevideo, Uruguay and was practiced by Uruguayan and Argentine dancers, musicians, and immigrant laborers. Music Argentine tango music is much more varied than ballroom tango music. A large amount of tango music has been composed by a variety of different orchestras over the last century. Not only is there a large volume of music, there is a breadth of stylistic differences between these orchestras as well, which makes it easier for Argentine tango dancers to spend the whole night dancing only Argentine tango. The four representative schools of the Argentine tango music are Di Sarli, d'Arienzo, Troilo and Pugliese, all four descendent from Italian immigrant families. They are dance orchestras, playing music for dancing. When the spirit of the music is characterized by counterpoint marking, clarity in the articulation is needed. It has a clear, repetitive pulse or beat, a strong tango-rhythm which is based on the 2x4, 2 strong beats on 4 (dos por cuatro). √Åstor Piazzolla stretched the classical harmony and counterpoint and moved the tango from the dance floor to the concert stage. His compositions tell us something of our contemporary life and dancing it relates much to modern dance. While Argentine tango dancing has historically been danced to tango music, such as that produced by such orchestra leaders as Osvaldo Pugliese, Carlos di Sarli, Juan d'Arienzo, in the '90s a younger generation of tango dancers began dancing tango steps to alternatives to tango music; music from other genres like, \\"world music\\", \\"electro-tango\\", \\"experimental rock\\", \\"trip hop\\", and \\"blues\\", to name a few. Tango nuevo dance is often associated with alternative music, see nuevo tango, but it can be danced to tango as well. List of tango bandleaders during the Golden Age of tango: Dance San Telmo, Buenos Aires. Argentine tango dancing consists of a variety of styles that developed in different regions and eras, and in response to the crowding of the venue and even the fashions in clothing. Even though the present forms developed in Argentina and Uruguay, they were also exposed to influences re- imported from Europe and North America. There are records of 18th and early 19th century tango styles in Cuba and Spain,Jos√© Luis Ortiz Nuevo El origen del tango americano\\" Madrid y La Habana 1849 while there is a flamenco tangos dance that may share a common ancestor in a minuet-style European dance. Consequently, there is a good deal of confusion and overlap between the styles as they are now danced - and fusions continue to evolve. Argentine tango is danced in an embrace that can vary from very open, in which leader and follower connect at arm's length, to very closed, in which the connection is chest-to-chest, or anywhere in between. Tango dance is essentially walking with a partner and the music. Dancing appropriately to the emotion and speed of a tango is extremely important to dancing tango. A good dancer is one who transmits a feeling of the music to the partner, leading them effectively throughout the dance. Also, dancers generally keep their feet close to the floor as they walk, the ankles and knees brushing as one leg passes the other. Argentine tango dancing relies heavily on improvisation; although certain patterns of movement have been codified by instructors over the years as a device to instruct dancers, there is a \\"basic step\\" called \\"basico\\". One of the few constants across all Argentine tango dance styles is that the follower will usually be led to alternate feet. Another is that the follower rarely has his or her weight on both feet at the same time. In many modern variations of Argentine Tango, particularly in Europe, teachers of Tango may establish a \\"basic step\\" in order to help students to learn and pick up the \\"feel\\" of the dance. Argentine tango is danced counterclockwise around the outside of the dance floor (the \\"line of dance\\") and dance \\"traffic\\" often segregates into a number of \\"lanes\\"; cutting across the middle of the floor is frowned upon. In general, the middle of the floor is where one finds either beginners who lack floor navigation skills or people who are performing \\"showy\\" figures or patterns that take up more dance floor space. It is acceptable to stop briefly in the line of dance to perform stationary figures, as long as the other dancers are not unduly impeded. The school of thought about this is, if there is open space in front, there are likely people waiting behind. Dancers are expected to respect the other couples on the floor; colliding or even crowding another couple, or stepping on others' feet is to be avoided strenuously. It is considered rude; in addition to possible physical harm rendered, it can be disruptive to a couple's musicality. Ballroom tango steps were standardized by dance studios. The steps have been relatively fixed in style for decades. However, Argentine tango has been an evolving dance and musical form, with continual changes occurring every day on the social dance floor in Argentina and in major tango centers elsewhere in the world. Argentine tango dance is, still based heavily on improvisation. While there are patterns or sequences of steps that are used by instructors to teach the dance, even in a sequence every movement is led not only in direction but also speed and quality (a step can be smooth, pulsing, sharp, ... etc.). Although Argentine tango evolves mostly on the dance floor, the government of Argentina does host an annual competition of Argentine tango dance in Buenos Aires, attracting competitors from around the world. Open embrace Close embrace =Elements= Embrace A striking difference between Argentine tango and ballroom tango is in the shape and feel of the embrace. Ballroom technique dictates that partners arch their upper bodies away from each other, while maintaining contact at the hip, in an offset frame. In Argentine tango, it is nearly the opposite: the dancers' chests are closer to each other than are their hips, and often there is contact at about the level of the chest (the contact point differing, depending on the height of the leader and the closeness of the embrace). In close embrace, the leader and the follower's chests are in contact and they are dancing with their heads touching or very near each other. In open embrace, there can be as much space as desired between the partners, but there should always be complete contact along the embracing arms to give optimum communication. Since Argentine tango is almost entirely improvisational, there needs to be clear communication between partners. Even when dancing in a very open embrace, Argentine tango dancers do not hold their upper bodies arched away from each other; yet, each partner is not always over their own axis, there are even styles that demand a constant leaning against each other. Whether open or closed, a tango embrace is not rigid, but relaxed, like a hug. Cross system walk. Parallel system walk. Walking One characteristic of Argentine tango is the walk outside of the legs of the follower. The inside walk belongs originally to the American Tango. It is seen in Argentine Tango, but it does not belong to it originally . Another difference is that the leader may freely step with his left foot when the follower steps with her left foot. In English, this is sometimes referred to as a \\"crossed\\" (e.g. \\"walking in the crossed system\\") or \\"uneven\\" walk in contrast to the normal walk which is called \\"parallel\\" or \\"even.\\" In ballroom tango, \\"crossed system\\" is considered incorrect unless the leader and follower are facing the same direction . Furthermore, the flexibility of the embrace allows the leader to change his weight from one foot to another while the follower's weight remains unchanged. This is another major difference with ballroom tango, where a weight change by one partner usually leads to a weight change by the other. The nomenclature originated with the Naveira/Salas \\"Investigation Group.\\" Early on, they used 'even/uneven' to describe the arrangement of legs in the walk (or turn). By the mid-1990s, they began using 'parallel/crossed' and later 'normal/crossed'. In dance the changing of feet is named contrapaso, or \\"contra-step\\". This change can be made off or on the normal beat.  Figures  Unlike the majority of social dances, Argentine tango does not have a basic step; instead is a completely improvised dance combining various elements in a spontaneous manner, as determined by the lead. To be able to improvise, the dancer needs to learn the lead and implementation of the different single elements of Tango, so they can be produced later by leading appropriately in space and music. The elements are just a few as caminar (walk), cruce (cross), ochos (figure-eight), ganchos (leg hooks), giros (turns), contragiros (turns in the other direction), sacadas (displacements), boleos (this expression comes from boleadoras, balls linked with cords, thrown to hunt animals), llevadas de pie (moving foot by foot), cortes (cuts), and quebradas (breaks). Well-known and simple combinations are called figura b√°sica (basic figures), especially when they contain just one element. Some of the elements are named as a figure. Cabeceo C√≥digos and yeta Argentine tango developed set of codes and superstitions throughout its history. 1\\\\. The Invitation to Dance An invitation to dance is traditionally done by ‚Äúcabeceo,‚Äù a head nod by one dancer met with eye contact. It is done during a cortina or early in the tanda. The advantage of the cabaceo is that it allows for unwanted dances to be avoided, and prevents any embarrassment that comes with a rejected dance. 2\\\\. How many songs do I dance with my partner? Argentine tango is danced in sets of songs, known as a ‚Äútanda.‚Äù A tanda is a set of three to four songs of one type of music- either tango, vals or milonga. If you accept a dance, you are expected to finish all of the songs with that partner. ‚ÄúBreaking the tanda‚Äù is viewed as incredibly rude, and it should not be done. Dancing two or more tandas with the same person is usually not done. It implies interest in your partner, and is seen as a flirtatious act. 3\\\\. When does the tanda end? After three to four songs, the tanda is flowed by a ‚Äúcortina‚Äù (curtain). It is traditionally a non-tango song that lasts approximately a minute. During this time the dancers return to their seats. Traditionally, it is frowned upon to dance to the music of a cortina. 4\\\\. Give Priority To Those Currently Dancing Never walk across the dance floor while people are dancing. When you get up to meet your dance partner, move to the outside edge of the dance floor. It is important to be mindful of those already dancing. 5\\\\. The Right Of Way On The Dance Floor Entering the line of dance in a crowded dance floor can be tricky. It is important to establish eye contact with the dancer approaching at your left before you enter the line of dance to avoid collision. 6\\\\. Distance Between Couples Always be mindful of the distance between you and your partner, and the couple ahead of you. Do not dance too closely to the couple ahead of you, or there could be a collision if they make a turn. Conversely, do not allow that distance to become too large. Never move backwards into the space of the couple behind you. 7\\\\. When The Dance Floor Becomes Crowded It is important to adapt your movements to the size of the crowd dancing. In a crowded social setting, the follower's feet should largely remain on the floor in order to avoid hitting anyone. Minimize large sweeping steps to avoid possibly hit another couple. 8\\\\. Small Talk It is frowned upon to talk whilst dancing. Small talk is appropriate in between songs, or if you are sitting and not dancing. 9\\\\. Feedback/ teaching It is not appropriate to give or receive feedback during Milongas. Correcting someone during this time takes away from the mutual enjoyment of the dance. Pr√°cticas and classes provide opportunities for this type of interaction. 10\\\\. Yetas Somewhat related is \\"yeta\\" - superstitions. For example, one doesn't dance to the well-known tango \\"Adi√≥s Muchachos\\" as it is (falsely) believed the last one sung by Carlos Gardel before his untimely accident leading to his death. Argentine Tango Etiquette today: While many of the c√≥digos largely remain unchanged, the dance continues evolve alongside modernity. In the history of Argentine tango, dancing two or more tandas with the same person was usually not done as it was seen as a flirtatious act. This is one ‚Äúrule‚Äù that is seen as more flexible in the modern era. This is especially true in smaller communities of tango dancers. Furthermore, tango has adapted to ever-changing fashion styles, and more casual clothing for men and women are accepted, although many make an effort to dress up for Milongas. The music played for cortinas is distinct, and cannot be confused with tango music. In Buenos Aires it is traditionally not acceptable to dance to cortinas. In the United States it is merely awkward to dance to them.  Vals and milonga  Argentine tango dancers usually enjoy two other related dances: vals (valsecito criollo argentino, vals porte√±o, vals tango) and milonga. Music for the vals is in time. Tango dancers dance the vals in a rather relaxed, smooth flowing dancing style in contrast to Viennese Waltz where the dancers often take 3 steps per measure and turn almost constantly. Experienced dancers alternate the smooth one-beat-per- measure walk with some double time steps (often incorrectly called syncopated walks), stepping on one- two- or (rarely) all three beats in a measure. Vals dancing is characterized by absence of pauses; continual turns (giros) in both directions are not done as in ballroom quick waltz, although turns are sometimes introduced for variety. Milonga, in time, has a strongly accented beat, and sometimes an underlying \\"habanera\\" rhythm. Dancers avoid pausing, and often introduce double time steps (incorrectly called syncopation and more appropriately called traspi√©s) into their walks and turns. Milonga dancing uses the same basic elements as tango, with a strong emphasis on the rhythm, and figures that tend to be less complex than some danced in other varieties of tango. Some tango instructors say that tango steps should not be used in milonga and that milonga has its own special rhythm and steps, which are quite different from tango. Milonga is also the name given to clubs and events specially for dancing tango. This double meaning of the word milonga can be confusing unless one knows the context in which the word \\"milonga\\" is used. People who attend milongas are known as milongueros. =Styles of Argentine tango dance=  Tango canyengue  Tango canyengue is a rhythmic style of tango that originated in the early 1900s and is still popular today. It is the original roots style of tango and contains all fundamental elements of traditional Argentine tango. In tango canyengue the dancers share one axis, dance in a closed embrace, and with the legs relaxed and slightly bent. Tango canyengue uses body dissociation for the leading, walking with firm ground contact, and a permanent combination of on- and off-beat rhythm. Its main characteristics are its musicality and playfulness. Its rhythm is described as \\"incisive, exciting, provocative\\".Jos√© Sebasti√°n Tallon El tango en su etapa de musica prohibida 1959 Since the beginning of the 21st century, the Argentine Canyengue movement (Movimiento Cultural Canyengue Argentino, MOCCA), has revived the style. In its contemporary evolution, tango canyengue combines the original, grounded steps and close embrace with elegance, esthetics, and complicity between the two dance partners. The word canyengue comes from the Kikongo language and means \\"melting with the music\\". It came into use to describe the tango rhythm at the time of the first so-called 'orquestas t√≠picas' (including bandone√≥n, violin and piano).Athus Espindola, Diccionario del Lunfardo 2002 Leading exponents of tango canyengue: * Romolo Garcia (deceased) * El Negro Celso (deceased) * Rodolfo Cieri (deceased) and Maria Cieri * Luis Grondona * Marta Anton (deceased) and 'El Gallego' Manolo Salvador * Roxina Villegas and Adrian Griffero * Ernest Williams and Maricela Wilson * Omar and Monica Ocampo See also Movimiento Cultural Canyengue Argentino  Tango orillero  Tango orillero refers to the style of dance that developed away from the town centers, in the outskirts and suburbs where there was more freedom due to more available space on the dance floor. The style is danced in an upright position and uses various embellishments including rapid foot moves, kicks, and even some acrobatics, though this is a more recent development.  Salon tango  Tango Salon does not refer to a single specific way of dancing tango. Rather, it is literally tango as it is danced socially in the salons (dance halls) of Buenos Aires. Salon tango was danced throughout the Golden Era of Argentine Tango (1935‚Äì1952) when milongas (tango parties) were held in large dance venues and full tango orchestras performed. Salon tango is often characterized by slow, measured, and smoothly executed moves, never moving against the line-of-dance, and respecting the space of other dancers on the floor around them. The emphasis is on precision, smoothness, musicality, good navigation, and following the c√≥digos (tango etiquette) of the salons. The couple embraces closely, with some variants having a flexible embrace, opening slightly to make room for various figures and closing again for support and poise. The walk is the most important element, and dancers usually walk 60%-70% of the time during a tango song. When tango became popular again after the end of the Argentine military dictatorships in 1983, this style was resurrected by dancers from the Golden Era: * Carlitos (Carlos) and Rosa Perez. The legendary teacher couple at Club Sunderlad, Buenos Aires. Almost all World Tango Championship winners have taken lessons from them. * Carlos Est√©vez \\"Petr√≥leo\\" ‚Ä† * Gerardo Portalea ‚Ä† * Jose \\"El Turco\\" Brahemcha * Jose \\"Lampazo\\" Vazquez ‚Ä† * Luis \\"Milonguita\\" Lemos ‚Ä† * Miguel Balmaceda ‚Ä† * Mingo and Esther Pugliese * Osvaldo Cartery ‚Ä† and Luisa \\"Coca\\" In√©s * Toto Faraldo * Pedro \\"Tete\\" Rusconi ‚Ä† * Ram√≥n \\"Finito\\" Rivera ‚Ä† * Virulazo ‚Ä† * In the milongas at Club Sin Rumbo, Sunderland, Club Glorias Argentinas, Salon El Pial and Salon Canning. One variant of Tango Salon is the Villa Urquiza style, named after the northern barrio of Buenos Aires where the clubs Sin Rumbo and Sunderland are located. Some argentinian dancers or couples who were or are current practitioners and teach the Villa Urquiza style of tango are: * El Chino Perico (one of the old milongueros) * Mar√≠a and Carlos Rivarola * The Dispari family with Jorge Dispari and Marita 'La Turca' and their daughters Samantha Dispari and Geraldine Rojas with their respective couples, Santiago Fina and Ezequiel Paludi. * Miguel Angel Zotto and Milena Plebs * Andr√©s Laza Moreno * Osvaldo Zotto‚Ä† and Lorena Ermocida * The Rodriguez family with Jorge and Liliana Rodr√≠guez their daughter Malena, and son Javier Rodr√≠guez. * The Miss√© family (Andrea Miss√© ‚Ä†, Sebasti√°n Miss√© with Andrea Reyero, Gabriel Miss√© and Stella Miss√©) * Carlos Perez and Rosa Forte * Fabi√°n Peralta * Adri√°n and Amanda Costa. Teaching in Europe. They live in France as of 2014. Studied under Jorge Dispari and Marita 'La Turca'. * Jos√© Luis Gonz√°lez (CL) and Paulina Cazab√≥n (CL). They live in Chile as of 2015 and tour in Europe (mainly France). * Juan Martin Carrara (UY) and Stefania Colina (UY). They live in Uruguay as of 2015 and tour in Europe * Carlos Rodriguez de Boedo (AR) and Brigita Urbietytƒó (LT). They live in Kaunas, Lithuania as of 2015 and teach mostly in Baltic and eastern countries. * Chiche Nu√±ez (AR). He lives in Berlin, Germany as of 2015. * Alper Erg√∂kmen and Selen S√ºrek. They live in Ankara, Turkey as of 2015 and teach mostly in Europe. * Ney Melo. He lives in US as of 2015. Millonguero embrace with upper body contact and lean.  \\"Estilo milonguero\\" (tango apilado/confiteria style; estilo del centro de Buenos Aires)  This is a close-embrace style named by Susana Miller in the 1990s.Susana Miller, Susana Miller - director of La Academia de Tango Ideal for crowded dance floors, it is danced chest-to- chest, knees relaxed, back straight, with the partners leaning - or appearing to lean - slightly toward each other to allow space for the feet to move. The center line of the leader's and follower's spines are directly in front of each other, requiring that each dancer turn their head to their left slightly to find space over their partner's right shoulder. The follower's left arm reaches directly up over the leader's shoulder without resting any body weight on the leader's shoulder. The leader's left hand and the follower's right hand clasp in the same manner as other styles of Argentine Tango, with elbows pointed down (contrasting with elbows up and pointed back as in ballroom tango), with little or no pressure applied by the arms or hands. The leader's right arm is held high across the follower's shoulder blades to help facilitate the upper chest connection, to avoid pulling the follower's lower torso and hips in toward the leader, thus allowing more flexibility of movement in the mid and lower spine and better extension of the follower's legs. In the case of followers that are not tall enough to place their head over the leader's shoulder, it is recommended that the follower's head be turned to the right and touch the left side of the head to the leader's chest, and the follower's left arm may wrap around the outside right arm (although this is generally not preferred as it limits the leader's flexibility of movement, and is a danger on crowded dance floors to have the follower's elbow sticking out). It is generally not recommended for a leader to dance milonguero style with a follower that is too tall for the leader to see over the follower's shoulder since it would be very difficult to navigate around the dance floor. A style of Carlitos Espinoza can be considered a modern development of tango milonguero.  Tango nuevo  Starting in the 1990s in Buenos Aires, the Tango Investigation Group (later transformed into the Cosmotango organization) founded by Gustavo Naveira and Fabi√°n Salas applied the principles of dance kinesiology from modern dance to analyze the physics of movement in Argentine tango. Taking what they learned from this analysis they then began to explore all the possibilities of movement within the framework of Argentine Tango. From the work of these founders of the Tango Nuevo movement, there was shift in all styles of tango away from teaching what to dance toward teaching how to dance. File:Homer tango linear voleo.jpgLinear boleo File:Homer tango volcada close.jpgVolcada lead in closed embrace Though widely referred to as a tango style outside of Argentina, Tango Nuevo is not considered a style of dancing tango by the founders of the movement. It refers only to the method of analysis and teaching developed through the application of the principles of dance kinesiology to Argentine Tango. In 2009, Gustavo Naveira published an essay New Tango in which he states, \\"There is great confusion on the question of the way of dancing the tango: call it technique, form, or style. The term tango nuevo, is used to refer to a style of dancing, which is an error. In reality, tango nuevo is everything that has happened with the tango since the 1980s. It is not a question of a style... The words tango nuevo express what is happening with tango dancing in general; namely that it is evolving.\\"Tango, A History of Obsession, Virginia Gift, 2008, (self published, appeared first in 2009) Therefore, as the Gustavo Naveira and other founders of the Tango Nuevo movement have said, all styles of tango, which have now been influenced by the analysis of the dance, are all Tango Nuevo. Despite the insistence by the founders of the Tango Nuevo movement that it is not a single style, it has become an accepted term by many that it is a separate and distinct style of tango. Practitioners of tango nuevo are Gustavo Naveira, Norberto \\"El Pulpo\\" Esbr√©s, Fabi√°n Salas, Sebasti√°n Arce, Mariana Montes, Mariano 'Chicho' Fr√∫mboli, Luc√≠a Mazer, Eugenia Parrilla. All of these dancers have highly individual styles that cannot be confused with each other, yet are all referred to by many as the tango nuevo style.  Tango traditional  A very pure and early form of tango, on base as walking rhythmically, not on the beat but with rhythm.  Tango con corte y quebrada  Tango which adds cortes and quebradas, cuts and breaks. The quebradas later on has been put in a more esthetic style (estilizar) and are today included into the category of poses de tango, or tango poses.  Tango de fantas√≠a  This style mostly evolved over the 1940-1950 time span. The term Tango de Fantas√≠a refers to music, dance, and dresses; it tries to codify a tango form different from the traditional one. Dancers added little sits and fast footwork ‚Äì doing fantasies, as some people called it. The related men's suit with a white border is named traje de fantas√≠a. In music, Osmar H√©ctor Maderna's was referred to as Tango de Fantas√≠a due to his arrangements which included fancy solos. During the same time period, people used to refer to the non- traditional Argentinian folklore by a similar expression: Folklore de Proyecci√≥n. Show tango A tango show in Buenos Aires Show tango, and Tango de Escenario (stage tango) is a more theatrical form of Argentine tango developed to suit the stage. In theory, all styles can be performed on stage, but the movement has to take stage elements into accounts, such as diagonals, centres, fronts, placement of lights, etc. Often, show tango routines includes embellishments, acrobatics, and solo moves that would be impractical on a social dance floor. Stage tango can be partially improvised, but in order for the general choreography to fit the set stage, some parts need to be rehearsed as a set routine. Stage Tango still has to be led like it is led in all other Tango styles; otherwise the couple is missing the main ingredient of the dance, namely, the typical intimate connection; this connection becomes visible only when the leader and follower enter their roles ‚Äì whether the show is choreographed or not. Tango on stage should not be confused with Tango de Fantasia or tango acrobatico, which is a particular style of tango that is only suitable for stage dancing.Nicole Nau-Klapwijk: Tango Dimensionen, Kastell Verlag GmbH 1999, Nicole Nau-Klapwijk: Tango, un baile bien porte√±o, Editorial Corregidor 2000, = Examples of tango shows = * Tango Javier Rodrigues & Geraldine Rojas Carlitos Espinoza & Noelia Hurtado * Tango vals Ariadna Naveira & Fernando Sanchez Javier Rodriguez & Geraldine Rojas Sebastian Arce & Mariana Montes Chicho Frumboli & Juana Sepulveda Resurgence outside Argentina Sunday afternoon tango at Plaza Dorrego in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of San Telmo. =France= In 1983, the dance show Tango Argentino, staged by Claudio Segovia and Hector Orezzolli, opened in Paris, France, starring dancers Juan Carlos Copes and Maria Nieves, N√©lida y Nelson, Eduardo y Gloria, Mar√≠a y Carlos Rivarola, Norma y Luis Pereyra, Mayoral y Elsa Maria, Carlos y In√©s Borges, Pablo Veron, Miguel Zotto and Milena Plebs, and Virulazo and Elvira. =United Kingdom= Argentine tango dancing in the UK began in the early 1990s in response to the hugely popular internationally touring shows \\"Forever Tango\\" and \\"Tango Argentino\\". Enthusiastic Anglo-Argentine milonguero (dance hall tango dancer) Andrew Potter who had followed \\"Forever Tango\\" to London and stayed for its extensive run, got together with some Londoner friends to start the city's first-ever tango milonga (tango dance party/hall) in The London Welsh Centre at 157 Grays Inn Road, known as \\"Tango The Argentine Way\\" which would pack out every Friday night. From that moment, the tango dances and classes proliferated throughout the capital and then throughout the rest of the UK. =US= In 1985, the French dance show Tango Argentino transferred to Broadway in New York City. Cast members gave classes to a number of students, including Robert Duvall. Paul Pellicoro provided a dance center for the performers to teach new students. At the same time, Danel and Maria Bastone were teaching tango in New York, and Orlando Paiva was offering tango classes in Los Angeles. For further lessons, Duvall sought out Nestor Ray, a dancer who Duvall had seen perform in the documentary film Tango mio. In 1986, Nora and Raul Dinzelbacher visited San Francisco, coming from La Paz, Entre R√≠os and Buenos Aires aboard a cruise ship where they were dancing tango and chacarera professionally. Al and Barbara Garvey took tango classes from them as well as from Jorge and Rosa Ledesma from Quilmes, Buenos Aires; all in the style of choreographed show tango. In 1987, the Garveys traveled to Buenos Aires to discover the traditional improvisational social dance style at a large milonga (Centro Akarense) filled with older dancers in Villa Urquiza.Tango List. Barbara Garvey. Re: [TANGO-L] Going to Bs As (Detecting sham and incompetent Teachers) June 27, 2003 Upon returning home to Fairfax, California, the Garveys continued tango lessons and began organizing milongas around the San Francisco Bay Area. They co-founded the Bay Area Argentine Tango Association (BAATA) and published a journal. In 1986, Brigitta Winkler appeared in her first stage performance, Tangoshow in Montreal. Though based in Berlin, Winkler traveled often to teach at tango festivals in North America throughout the following two decades. Winkler was a seminal influence of Daniel Trenner. Montreal's first tango teachers, French-born Lily Palmer and her Argentine friend, Antonio Perea, offered classes in 1987. The Dinzelbachers settled in San Francisco in 1988, in response to the demand for tango teachers following a visit to San Francisco by the touring production of Tango Argentino. Nora and Raul Dinzelbacher taught a core group of students who would later become teachers themselves, including the Garveys, Polo Talnir and Jorge Allende. In 1989, the Dinzelbachers were invited to Cincinnati by Richard Powers, to introduce and teach Argentine tango at a weeklong dance festival. The following year, Powers moved his festival to Stanford University and asked the Dinzelbachers back. Unfortunately, Raul Dinzelbacher, 40 years old, collapsed and died at the end of the third day of the festival. Nora Dinzelbacher was devastated but threw herself into her work, forming a dance performance troupe and teaching. She asked a student, George Guim, to become her assistant. They taught at a week-long dance festival in Port Townsend, Washington. Throughout 1990, Luis Bravo's Forever Tango played in eight West Coast cities, increasing viewer's interest in learning the tango. Carlos Gavito and his partner Marcela Duran invented a dramatically different tango embrace in which both dancers leaned forward against each other more than was traditionally accepted. Gavito's ultimate rise to fame came from this starring appearance in Forever Tango. In 1991, Richard Powers asked Nora Dinzelbacher to help him transform \\"Stanford Dance Week\\" into \\"Stanford Tango Week\\". The two produced the popular annual festival until the University abruptly cancelled it after its 1997 run. In 1998, with Bob Moretti, a retired USAF Lt. Col. and one of her students, Nora began a new festival in the same vein: \\"Nora's Tango Week\\", held in Emeryville, California. Moretti would continue to co-produce the festival until his death on June 22, 2005, just days before that year's Tango Week. In the first half of 1994, Barbara Garvey's BAATA mailing list grew from 400 to 1,400 dancers. Garvey places the critical mass of the San Francisco Bay Area's tango resurgence at this point. The number of regional milongas went from three per month to 30.Tango List Barbara Garvey. Re: [TANGO-L] Revival of Tango in North America July 25, 2003] Forever Tango returned to the United States late in 1994, landing in Beverly Hills, then San Francisco, where it ran for 92 weeks. From there the show went to New York where it became the longest-running tango production in Broadway history. In June 1995, Janis Kenyon held a tango festival at Northwestern University. Kenyon had attended Stanford Tango Week in 1993, where she met Juan Carlos Copes and Maria Nieves. The pair were invited to teach at Kenyon's 1995 Chicago event. The next year, Kenyon moved her festival to Columbus, Ohio, where she featured Osvaldo Zotto. In February 1997, Clay Nelson (a two-time attendee at Stanford Tango Week) organized his first ValenTango festival in Portland, Oregon; \\"Tango Fantasy on Miami Beach\\" was formed by Jorge Nel, Martha Mandel, Lydia Henson and Randy Pittman as Florida's first tango festival; and the Portland October Tangofest was launched, again by Clay Nelson. 1999 saw a split in Miami: Nel and Mandel scheduled their \\"United States Tango Congress\\" to open a month prior to the Tango Fantasy event. Daniel Trenner has been credited with bringing improvisational social Argentine tango to the United States. Like the Garveys, he first went to Buenos Aires in 1987, where he went to a milonga in Palermo and saw the traditional improvisational style being danced. Trenner was introduced to Miguel and Nelly Balmacera, a couple who would become his first tango teachers. Being fluent in both Spanish and English he was able to study with many Argentine tango masters, including Gustavo Naveira and Mingo Pugliese. He made video tapes of the lessons he took and translated the Spanish instruction into English. In the late 1980s, Trenner brought his newfound appreciation of traditional tango back to New York and conducted classes. In 1991, Trenner began working with Rebecca Shulman in performing and teaching tango. (Shulman would go on to be a co-founder and director of TangoMujer in New York and Berlin.) In 1995, Trenner taught for ten weeks in Colorado, followed by some 15 of those students accompanying him to Buenos Aires. Out of this experience, \\"Tango Colorado\\" was formed by Tom Stermitz and other tango aficionados from Denver, Boulder and Fort Collins, and a twice-yearly tango festival was organized in Denver. Trenner had planted the seed and moved on. In this way, Trenner has been called the Johnny Appleseed of tango.Tom Stermitz. Re: [TANGO-L]; Revival of Tango in North America / Pellicoro Book, July 25, 2003] In February 2009, the popular ABC series Dancing with the Stars announced that the Argentine tango would be added to the list of dances for its eighth season, following the initiative by its British parent show Strictly Come Dancing the previous year. There are numerous tango festivals in the United States: Seattle Tango Magic, Denver Memorial Day, Portland Valentango in Portland, Oregon, Denver Tango Festival in Denver, Colorado, Boston Tango Festival in Boston.

He established himself as an action star with supporting roles as a mysterious cowboy drifter in Guns of the Magnificent Seven (1969), and as a deputy sheriff in the western Wild Rovers (1971), before receiving worldwide fame for his roles as a mafia hitman in Charley Varrick (1973), real-life Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser in the classic action film Walking Tall (1973), brute force detective Mitchell in Mitchell (1975), deputy sheriff Thomas Jefferson Geronimo III in Final Justice (1985), and as chief Jerry Karlin in the action-comedy Fletch (1985). Life and career Baker was born in Groesbeck, Texas, the son of Edna (n√©e McDonald) and Doyle Charles Baker.Joe Don Baker Biography (1936‚Äì) He attended the University of North Texas and graduated with a business degree in 1958. Baker served a tour of duty in the United States Army. In the 1963-1964 Broadway season, he appeared on stage in Marathon '33 at the ANTA Theatre in New York City.Playbill, vol. 1 (January 1964) No. 1, Marathon ‚Äô33, p. 27. His career had its roots in television, though he did appear in several movies, including a part in the 1967 film Cool Hand Luke. He appeared in many television series, graduating to featured guest roles in such series as The Big Valley (in which he played a Harvard-educated Native American with a penchant for fighting) and Mod Squad (where he appeared as an illiterate vending machine robber). He was the title character in the 1971 TV movie Mongo's Back in Town, starring Telly Savalas. At nearly 6'3\\" tall (189 cm), Baker was often cast in Westerns, both on film and television. While working regularly on television on shows like Bonanza and Gunsmoke, he appeared in supporting roles in such films Guns of the Magnificent Seven (1969) and Blake Edwards' Wild Rovers, but his film career didn't start to quicken until he scored the role of Steve McQueen's younger brother in Sam Peckinpah's Junior Bonner, a film about a contemporary rodeo cowboy, which was released in late 1972. His breakthrough came with the 1973 film Walking Tall, directed by Phil Karlson. (He also starred in the filmmaker's final work, Framed, two years later.) Released in February as a regional exploitation picture, Walking Tall clicked with audiences and became an unexpected hit, picked up for national distribution with a new TV ad campaign using the slogan, \\"When was the last time you stood up and applauded a movie?\\" The film eventually earned $23 million at the box office. Baker's performance was praised by influential film critic Pauline Kael, but he turned down the sequel. Later that year, his work in Charley Varrick helped solidify Baker's reputation. He also co-starred with Robert Duvall in the 1973 crime film The Outfit and starred in the 1974 adventure film Golden Needles. Baker has given many performances in a career spanning four decades. In 1980, he became the first actor to receive $1 million to star in a television series, the short-lived Eischeid (known as \\"Chief Of Detectives\\" in the UK). Baker played \\"The Whammer,\\" a baseball player modeled after Babe Ruth, in the 1984 baseball drama The Natural which starred Robert Redford. In 1985, he portrayed the corrupt Chief Jerry Karlin in Fletch. In the UK, he played CIA agent Darius Jedburgh in the BBC Television drama serial Edge of Darkness. He was nominated for \\"Best Actor\\" by the British Academy Television Awards, losing to his co-star Bob Peck. Martin Scorsese directed him as a private detective in 1991's Cape Fear, hired by a man (Nick Nolte) whose family is being threatened by a psychopathic ex-convict (Robert De Niro). Baker received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of North Texas in 1994. While actor Carroll O'Connor was undergoing heart bypass surgery, Baker took his place on the television series In the Heat of the Night. Baker appeared as Captain Tom Dugan, a retired police captain who filled in while O'Connor's character was away at a police convention. More recently, he has had appearances in Joe Dirt, The Dukes of Hazzard and Strange Wilderness. In 2009, Baker delivered another performance in The Cleaner on A&E;, playing an alcoholic military veteran attempting to help a friend cope with the loss of his son. He hires William Banks (played by Benjamin Bratt) to help him start back down the road to sobriety. Baker played \\"King\\" in 2012's Mud with Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon and Sam Shepard. =James Bond series= In 1987, Baker played the villainous arms dealer Brad Whitaker in the Bond film The Living Daylights, starring Timothy Dalton as 007. In 1995 and 1997, Baker returned to the series, this time playing a different character, CIA agent Jack Wade, in GoldenEye and Tomorrow Never Dies, with Pierce Brosnan as Bond. Baker is one of four actors to appear as both a Bond ally and a villain, the others being Charles Gray, who appeared as Henderson in You Only Live Twice and Ernst Stavro Blofeld in Diamonds Are Forever; Walter Gotell, who appeared as Morzeny, the SPECTRE Island trainer, in From Russia with Love and as General Gogol, the head of the KGB, in six films between 1977 and 1987; and Richard Kiel as Jaws, in The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker, assisting 007 in the latter film.

It is owned by The McClatchy Company. History The paper was first published as the Idaho Tri-Weekly Statesman on July 26, 1864, by James S. Reynolds; it began publication from a log cabin on the current site of Boise City Hall. Reynolds owned and operated the paper for its first eight years, selling to Judge Milton Kelly in 1872. Kelly's 17-year run ended in 1888, with the expansion to daily publication, and a name change: The Idaho Daily Statesman. That summer, Kelly sold the paper to the Cobb family, which went on to run the paper for 70 years. Calvin Cobb published the Statesman until his death in 1928, when control was transferred to his daughter Margaret Cobb Ailshie. The paper's history site says \\"Ailshie insisted on a lively editorial policy, deploring 'a dull newspaper'\\". Cobb Ailshie died in 1959, and general manager James Brown took control of the paper.

De La Beche was claiming that since Carboniferous fossils were found deep in the Greywacke strata, which itself was older than the Carboniferous period, this method of dating rocks was not viable. Murchison, on the other hand, claimed that De La Beche did not place the fossils correctly, as they were occurring quite near the top of the strata as opposed to deep within it. De La Beche soon agreed with Murchison's argument as to the placing of fossils but maintained that since a layer of Old Red Sandstone, present in other formations, was missing between the layer of older rock and this new formation, there was still insufficient evidence to suggest the formation was not part of the older Silurian strata. There followed much debate and some extensive investigations which ranged as far as Russia, where in 1840 Murchison discovered a layer similar to the one found in Devon placed between well-defined Silurian and Carboniferous deposits. This discovery put an end to the controversy and led to the definition of a new period called Devonian. Further reading * Rudwick, Martin J. S.

The first idea, the thesis, is a formal statement illustrating a point; it is followed by the second idea, the antithesis, that contradicts or negates the first; and lastly, the third idea, the synthesis, resolves the conflict between the thesis and antithesis. It is often used to explain the dialectical method of German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,Robert C. Solomon (1986), In the Spirit of Hegel, Oxford UP, p. 23. but Hegel never used the terms himself; instead his triad was concrete, abstract, absolute. The thesis, antithesis, synthesis triad actually originated with Johann Fichte.\\"Review of Aenesidemus\\" (\\"Rezension des Aenesidemus\\", Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, February 11‚Äì12, 1794). Trans. Daniel Breazeale. In History of the idea Thomas McFarland (2002), in his Prolegomena to Coleridge's Opus Maximum,Samuel Taylor Coleridge: Opus Maximum. Princeton University Press, 2002, p. 89. identifies Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781) as the genesis of the thesis/antithesis dyad. Kant concretises his ideas into: * Thesis: \\"The world has a beginning in time, and is limited with regard to space.\\" * Antithesis: \\"The world has no beginning and no limits in space, but is infinite, in respect to both time and space.\\" Inasmuch as conjectures like these can be said to be resolvable, Fichte's Grundlage der gesamten Wissenschaftslehre (Foundations of the Science of Knowledge, 1794) resolved Kant's dyad by synthesis, posing the question thus: * Are synthetic judgments a priori possible?  No synthesis is possible without a preceding antithesis. As little as antithesis without synthesis, or synthesis without antithesis, is possible; just as little possible are both without thesis. Fichte employed the triadic idea \\"thesis‚Äìantithesis‚Äìsynthesis\\" as a formula for the explanation of change.Harry Ritter, Dictionary of Concepts in History. Greenwood Publishing Group (1986), p.114 Fichte was the first to use the trilogy of words together, in his Grundriss des Eigent√ºmlichen der Wissenschaftslehre, in R√ºcksicht auf das theoretische Verm√∂gen (1795, Outline of the Distinctive Character of the Wissenschaftslehre with respect to the Theoretical Faculty): \\"Die jetzt aufgezeigte Handlung ist thetisch, antithetisch und synthetisch zugleich.\\" [\\"The action here described is simultaneously thetic, antithetic, and synthetic.\\"] Still according to McFarland, Schelling then, in his Vom Ich als Prinzip der Philosophie (1795), arranged the terms schematically in pyramidal form. According to Walter Kaufmann (1966), although the triad is often thought to form part of an analysis of historical and philosophical progress called the Hegelian dialectic, the assumption is erroneous: Gustav E. Mueller (1958) concurs that Hegel was not a proponent of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, and clarifies what the concept of dialectic might have meant in Hegel's thought. According to Mueller, the attribution of this tripartite dialectic to Hegel is the result of \\"inept reading\\" and simplistic translations which do not take into account the genesis of Hegel's terms: Karl Marx (1818‚Äì1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820‚Äì1895) adopted and extended the triad, especially in Marx's The Poverty of Philosophy (1847). Here, in Chapter 2, Marx is obsessed by the word \\"thesis\\";marxists.org: Chapter 2 of \\"The Poverty of Philosophy\\", by Karl Marx it forms an important part of the basis for the Marxist theory of history. Writing pedagogy In modern times, the dialectic of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis has been implemented across the world as a strategy for organizing expositional writing. For example, this technique is taught as a basic organizing principle in French schools: Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis has also been used as a basic scheme to organize writing in the English language. For example, the website WikiPreMed.com advocates the use of this scheme in writing timed essays for the MCAT standardized test: See also ;Books * Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences * Science of Logic * The Phenomenology of Spirit ;People * Heinrich Moritz Chalyb√§us * ;Topics * Aufheben * Fusion of horizons * Truth References External links *Dialectical Inquiry *A passage from Karl Marx' works using the terms 3 (number) Hegelianism Philosophical phrases Quotations from literature Theories of history Words and phrases introduced in the 18th century ","title":"Thesis, antithesis, synthesis"},{"id":"960686","title":"Grammy Award for Best Traditional World Music Album"},{"id":"960687","title":"Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album"},{"id":"960697","text":"Ross McKitrick (born 1965) is a Canadian economist specializing in environmental economics and policy analysis.

White's imposing mass of pawns in the centre often includes pawns on c4, d4, e5, and f4. Grandmaster (GM) Nick de Firmian observes of Alekhine's Defence in MCO-15 (2008), \\"The game immediately loses any sense of symmetry or balance, which makes the opening a good choice for aggressive fighting players.\\"Nick de Firmian, Modern Chess Openings, Fifteenth Edition, 2008, p. 159. .

Four years later, the editors of the Fourth Edition of Modern Chess Openings () wrote: > Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the > 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defence introduced by Alekhine ... . > Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his > King's Knight to be driven about the board in the early stages of the game, > in the expectation of provoking a weakness in White's centre pawns.R.C. > Griffith and M.E. Goldstein, Modern Chess Openings, Fourth Edition, 1925, p. > 1. In addition to Alekhine, another early exponent of the defence was Ernst Gr√ºnfeld.  Use  The Alekhine's Defence was more popular in the past. For instance, Fischer used it in several games against Boris Spassky in the World Chess Championship 1972, and Korchnoi also included the defence in his , leading to its respectable reputation. Nowadays, Alekhine's defense is not so common at the top level. De Firmian observes, \\"The fashion could quickly change if some champion of the opening takes up the cause, as the results Black has obtained in practice are good.\\" The opening's current highest-rated proponent is GM Vassily Ivanchuk, although Lev Alburt played it at grandmaster-level almost exclusively during his career and was responsible for many contributions in both theory and practice. Currently, grandmasters Shabalov and Minasian use the opening with regularity, while Aronian, Adams, and Nakamura will use it on occasion. Carlsen does not employ the opening frequently, but he has used it occasionally in competitive games, most notably he defeated the former World Chess Champion Topalov in Linares 2008 employing the Alekhine's defence. A game by Napol√©on Bonaparte from the 19th century shows the oldest known example of Alekhine's Defense being employed in a game. Napol√©on won the game.  Main line: 2.e5 Nd5  After the usual 2.e5 Nd5, three main variations of Alekhine's Defence use 3.d4, but there are other options for White at this point. Two of the main lines are the Exchange Variation and the Four Pawns Attack. The Exchange Variation continues 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6. White has some advantage. Black can capitalise on the half-open centre with ...g6, ...Bg7 with ...Bg4 eventually being played. The Four Pawns Attack continues 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.f4. White has a somewhat larger space advantage though the centre is not fixed. Black has a number of options. Black can play ...Qd7 with ...0-0-0 and ...f6 putting pressure on White's d-pawn. Black can play ...Nb4 with ...c5 hoping to exchange the d-pawn. Finally, Black can play ...Be7 with ...0-0 and ...f6 attacking the centre. Minor variations include O'Sullivan's Gambit, 3.d4 b5 (intending 4.Bxb5 c5 5.dxc5 Qa5+), and 3.d4 d6 4.Bc4, the Balogh Variation. = Four Pawns Attack: 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.f4 = The Four Pawns Attack is White's most ambitious try, and the variation which perhaps best illustrates the basic idea behind the defence: Black allows White to make several tempo- gaining attacks on the knight and to erect an apparently imposing pawn centre in the belief that it can later be destroyed. The game can become very since White must either secure his advantage in space or make use of it before Black succeeds in making a successful strike at it. Black must also play vigorously because passive play will be crushed by the white centre. The Four Pawns Attack is not particularly popular because many White players are wary of entering a sharp tactical line which Black may have prepared. The main line continues 5...dxe5 6.fxe5 Nc6 7.Be3 Bf5 8.Nc3 e6 9.Nf3. An alternative is the sharp Planinc Variation, 5...g5. Black hopes for 6.fxg5 dxe5, wrecking White's centre and leaving him with weak pawns. The line is named after GM Albin Planinc, who championed it in the 1970s. It was then taken up in the 1990s by correspondence player Michael Schirmer, whose games were noted in a recent book on Alekhine's Defence by British GM and Alekhine exponent Nigel Davies. = Exchange Variation: 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6 = The Exchange Variation is less ambitious than the Four Pawns Attack. White trades pawns, accepting a more modest spatial advantage. Black's main decision is whether to recapture with the solid 5...exd6, which will lead to a fairly strategic position, or the more ambitious 5...cxd6 when Black has a preponderance of pawns in the centre. The third recapture 5...Qxd6 is also possible since the fork 6.c5 can be answered by 6...Qe6+, but the line is considered inferior since Black will sooner or later need to deal with this threat. In the sharper 5...cxd6 line, Black usually aims to attack and undermine the white pawn on d4, and possibly c4 as well. To do this, a usual plan involves a fianchetto of the to g7, playing the other bishop to g4 to remove a knight on f3 which is a key defender of d4, while black knights on b6 and c6 bear down on the white pawns on c4 and d4. Cox gave the game Jainy Gomes‚ÄìGuillermo Soppe, S√£o Paulo 2001 to illustrate Black's intentions. A popular setup from White to prevent Black's plan is the Voronezh Variation (named after the Russian city Voronezh, where the line was invented, by players such as Grigory Sanakoev). The Voronezh is defined by the opening sequence 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6 cxd6 6.Nc3 g6 7.Be3 Bg7 8.Rc1 0-0 9.b3. White's setup delays so that Black has trouble developing pieces in a fashion that harasses White's pieces and assails the centre pawns; for instance there is no knight on f3 which can become a target after ...Bg4, and no bishop on d3 which may be a target after ...Nc6‚Äìe5. While 9...Nc6 is Black's most common reply according to ChessBase's database, after 10.d5 Ne5 Black's knight lacks a target, and will soon be chased out with f2‚Äìf4, and this line has scored very poorly for Black. The main line in the Voronezh, and the second most common reply, is 9...e5 10.dxe5 dxe5 11.Qxd8 Rxd8 12.c5 N6d7 (This retreat is forced since 12...Nd5?? loses the knight due to the 13.Rd1 pin) when Black must play carefully to unentangle and challenge the white pawn on c5. Other lines against the Voronezh include 9...f5 leading to sharp play. Other solid moves such as 9...e6, ...Bd7, ...Bf5, and ...a5 are possible as well. According to John Cox, the 9...e5 line is adequate, but Black needs to know the line well. The Voronezh was recommended by John Emms and noted as a big problem by Nigel Davies, leading many players to opt for the more solid 5...exd6 line. However, the line offers Black less opportunity for counterplay. In this line Black usually develops the king bishop via ...Be7 and ...Bf6, because Bg5 can be bothersome against a fianchetto setup with ...g6 and ...Bg7, e.g. 6.Nc3 g6 7.Nf3 Bg7 8.Bg5. = Modern Variation: 3.d4 d6 4.Nf3 = The Modern Variation is the most common variation of the Alekhine Defence. As in the Exchange Variation, White accepts a more modest spatial advantage, and hopes to be able to hang on to it. There are a number of possible Black responses: *4...Bg4, pinning the knight is the most common response, which White usually parries with 5.Be2. Black will often voluntarily surrender the by ...Bxf3 because the white knight is a fairly strong piece, and capturing it undermines the white centre pawns. Champions of this line include Lev Alburt, Vlatko Kovaƒçeviƒá and the late Vladimir Bagirov. *4...g6, preparing to fianchetto a bishop to oppose White's central pawn mass, is also often seen. This variation was played in the thirteenth game of the Match of the Century between Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer. (The nineteenth game of the same match featured the more common 4...Bg4.) Alburt has also played this line frequently.Burgess, Chapter 9, Alburt Variation. White usually replies with 5.Bc4, the Keres Variation. *4...dxe5 (the Larsen Variation) eliminates the advanced pawn, but brings forward the white knight after 5.Nxe5. Challenging this knight immediately with 5...Nd7 can lead to the sharp sacrificial line 5.Nxe5 Nd7 6.Nxf7 Kxf7 7.Qh5+ Ke6. The sacrifice is, at the very least, good enough to draw after 8.Qg4+; Larsen tried the suicidal 8...Kd6? against Fischer during the Santa Monica Blitz tournament in 1966, and lost quickly after 9.c4.Fischer‚ÄìLarsen Santa Monica blitz, 1966 Black should therefore acquiesce to the perpetual check with 8...Kf7 9.Qh5+ Ke6 etc. Instead, 8.c4 can be played if White is aiming to win. White can also simply retreat the knight with 5.Nf3. If Black does not want to allow the sacrifice, other options after 5.Nxe5 are 5...g6 (the Kengis Variation) and 5...c6 (the Miles Variation). The idea behind both moves is to challenge the e5-knight with ...Nd7 only after the sacrifice on f7 has become unsound. The Kengis variation looks more natural but White has several sharp ideas such as 6.c4 and the wild 6.Qf3!?. Therefore, 5...c6 has become more common; despite the passive look this waiting move discourages White's most ambitious continuations. Now 6.c4 can be met with the very interesting 6...Nb4!? while 6.Bc4 can either transpose to quieter lines of the Kengis or give rise to independent variations in which Black avoids the king's bishop fianchetto. White's most popular move is 6.Be2 (6.Bd3!?) when Black continues with either the immediate 6...Nd7 or 6...Bf5. Against the latter an aggressive possibility (introduced by Kasparov against Short and then improved by Judith Polgar) is 7.g4!?. In top-level chess, the line with 5...c6 has largely displaced 4...Bg4 as the main line. *4...c6 is passive but solid, creating a position that is difficult to attack. In most variations, Black can play ...Bg4 to transpose into the 4...Bg4 line. = Balogh Variation: 3.d4 d6 4.Bc4 = The first recorded use of this variation was Canal‚ÄìColle, Carlsbad 1929. White resigned after Black's 40th move. Unlike several other sidelines, 4.Bc4 is fairly popular. The line contains some traps that can snare the unwary. For example, 4...dxe5 5.dxe5 Nb6?? loses the queen to 6.Bxf7+ Instead, the main line is 4...Nb6 5.Bb3, when Black has usually played 5...dxe5 6.Qh5 e6 7.dxe5 (the \\"old main line\\" according to Cox) or 5...Bf5 when White can among other things try the obstructive pawn sacrifice 6.e6. In either case, White obtains attacking chances, and so Taylor recommends 5...d5 followed by 6...e6 to reach a position akin to the French Defence.Taylor, chapter 8 \\"Fourth or fifth move sidelines\\" = Two Pawns Attack: 3.c4 Nb6 4.c5 = The Two Pawns Attack (also known as the Lasker Attack or the Chase VariationBurgess, Graham, The Complete Alekhine, 1992 B.T. Batsford Ltd., p.45. Taylor, Chapter 7, The Chase Variation ‚Äì Back to the Centre) is also an ambitious try. White may gain attacking prospects, but it might cost a pawn to do so.DeFirmian, Nick and Walter Korn, Modern Chess Openings, 1990 M-Mate Chess. . Referred to as the Two Pawns Attack in lines 28‚Äì30. White's pawns on c5 and e5 secure a spatial advantage, but the d5-square has been weakened. Unlike the Four Pawns Attack, the white centre is not as fluid and the game takes on a more strategic character. Aesthetically, 4.c5 looks positionally suspect, since White's pawn advances have severely weakened the d5-square.Taylor, Page 182. White's intention is to grab space and mobility so that those strategic deficiencies are of little consequence. Black must play 4...Nd5, whereupon White will usually challenge the knight with moves like Bc4 and Nc3. Black can defend the knight with ...c6 or ...e6, sometimes playing both. Typically, Black then challenges White's pawns on e5 and c5 with moves like ...d6 and ...b6. The statistics presented by Cox show this variation scoring poorly for White, with all of Black's main defences scoring at least 50%. = Two Knights Variation: 3.Nc3 = In the Two Knights Variation, White immediately accepts doubled pawns after 3...Nxc3 for some compensation. After 4.dxc3 this compensation is rapid piece development. Although the line after 4...d6, challenging the e-pawn often can lead to fairly dull positions, the position remains open and Black can quickly succumb with poor defence, for example after 5.Bc4 dxe5?? 6.Bxf7+!, White wins the queen on d8. After 4.bxc3 White's compensation for the doubled pawns is a big centre that can be used as a basis for a kingside attack. The resulting pawn structure leads to position similar to that of the Winawer variation of the French Defence. If Black does not want to defend against White's attacking opportunities against 3...Nxc3 4.dxc3, then 3...e6 is a reasonable alternative that was Alekhine's choice when meeting the Two Knights, and this defence has been advocated by Taylor.Taylor, chapter 9 \\"Third Move Sidelines\\" If White plays 4.d4, then 4...Nxc3 forces White into the bxc3 line reminiscent of the French. If 4.Nxd5 exd5, Black will quickly dissolve the doubled pawns with ...d6, and the resulting position will tend to be drawish. = Minor sidelines after 2.e5 Nd5 = In Endre Steiner‚ÄìAlexander Alekhine, Budapest 1921, the first high level game with the Alekhine Defence, White played 3.d4 d6 4.Bg5. Cox recommends 4...h6 5.Bh4 dxe5 6.dxe5 Bf5, followed by ...Nc6 and ...Ndb4, targeting c2. Another rare line, but one that scores well in practice is 3.d4 d6 4.Be2, preventing Black from playing 4...Bg4 while retaining the option of making the pawn advance f2‚Äìf4. After 3.c4 Nb6 4.a4, White aims at chasing the black knight away followed by a pawn sacrifice that impairs Black's development, for example by 4...d6 5.a5 N6d7 6.e6. It is possible for Black to allow this, but it is simpler to prevent it by 4...a5. White's main continuation is to deploy the for duties on the kingside with 5.Ra3, followed by Rg3 at some point when the attack on g7 is supposed to tie Black down from developing the bishop to e7. However, after 5...d6 6.exd6 exd6 7.Rg3 Bf5, Black can carry through with 8...Be7 anyway, since after 9.Rxg7 the rook would be trapped and lost to 9...Bg6 and 10...Bf6. The idea for this unusual early \\"rook lift\\" probably originated with the well- known American International Master Emory Tate. http://www.thechessdrum.net/palview5/tatevariation(selected).htm Women's World Champion GM Maria Muzychuk, World Junior Champion GM Lu Shanglei and GM Nazar Firman have experimented with this line and achieved some success with it. = Alternatives to 2...Nd5 = After 2.e5, 2...Nd5 is almost universally played. The two other knight moves that do not it to the queen on d1 are 2...Ng8 and 2...Ne4. *2...Ng8, undeveloping the knight immediately, was named the \\"Brooklyn Defence\\" in honour of his hometown by GM Joel Benjamin, who calls this his \\"pet line\\".Joel Benjamin, American Grandmaster: Four Decades of Chess Adventures, Gloucester Publishers, 2007, p. 167. . Although Black might be said to be giving odds of three moves, White only has a small advantage according to theory.Most opening treatises do not mention this line. According to Nunn's Chess Openings, White gets a slight advantage after 3.d4 d6 4.Nf3 Bg4 5.h3. John Nunn, Graham Burgess, John Emms, and Joe Gallagher, Nunn's Chess Openings, Everyman Publishers, 1999, p. 129 n. 30. . The first recorded use of the Brooklyn Variation was in 1905 in Vienna where Aron Nimzowitsch with white checkmated Adolf Albin on the 34th move. *Very dubious is 2...Ne4?, which John L. Watson and Eric Schiller dub the \\"Mokele Mbembe\\". They analyse 3.d4 f6 4.Bd3 d5 5.f3 Ng5 6.Bxg5 fxg5 7.f4! g6! 8.Nf3! g4 (they also analyse 8...gxf4 9.Ng5! e6 10.Qg4! Qe7 11.0-0 and 8...Bg4 9.h3, both leading a large advantage for White) 9.Ng5 Bh6 10.Nxh7 Rxh7 11.Bxg6+ Rf7 12.Qd3 Bf8 13.f5 e6 14.f6 Qd7 15.h3! g3 16.Qxg3, with a winning advantage for White.John Watson and Eric Schiller, The Big Book of Busts, Hypermodern Press, 1995, pp. 120‚Äì21. . Nunn's Chess Openings concludes that White gets a large advantage with 3.d4 f6 (or 3...e6 4.Nh3 h6 5.Qg4 d5 6.f3 h5 7.Qf4 g5 8.Nxg5 Nxg5 9.Qxg5 Be7 10.Qg7) 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Qh4 d5 6.Bd3.John Nunn, Graham Burgess, John Emms, and Joe Gallagher, Nunn's Chess Openings, Everyman Publishers, 1999, p. 129 n. 30. .  2.Nc3  Instead of chasing Black's knight, White may defend the e4-pawn, either directly or through tactical means. 2.Nc3 is by far White's most common alternative to 2.e5; in fact Cox noted that he saw this move in over half his games with the Alekhine. It is often played by amateurs and those wishing to avoid a theoretical battle on territory more familiar to their opponents. Cox, however, wrote that many White players are bluffing, and in fact know nothing about either the Vienna Game or the Four Knights Game, to which the game can easily transpose if Black plays 2...e5, citing one book which recommended 2.Nc3 while assuring readers that 2...e5 is uncommon. Another transposition Black may enter is 2...d6, which usually leads to the Pirc Defence. The independent Alekhine line is 2...d5, known as the Scandinavian Variation. After 2...d5, 3.exd5 Nxd5 4.Bc4, 4...Nb6 or 4...Nxc3 is considered roughly equal, while 4...e6 is solid but blocks in the light-squared bishop. 4.g3 has been played by the Danish correspondence player Ove Ekebjaerg, when Harald Keilhack recommends 4...Nxc3 5.bxc3 Qd5! 6.Qf3! (6.Nf3 Qe4+ is awkward in light of 7.Be2 Bh3 or 7.Qe2 Qxc2) Qe6+! 7.Qe2 (\\"on 7.Be2 or 7.Ne2, 7...Bd7 is unpleasant\\") Qxe2+ 8.Nxe2 Bd7! 9.Bg2 Bc6 10.0-0 Bxg2 11.Kxg2 Nc6 12.d3 g6 13.Rb1 0-0-0 14.c4 Bg7, when \\"Black has a rather comfortable position\\", as in Ekebjaerg‚ÄìAlcantara Soares, corr. 1989.Harald Keilhack, \\"Knight on the Left: 1.Nc3\\", Schachverlag Kania, 2005, pp. 239‚Äì40. . More combative after 2...d5 is 3.e5, when Black can choose among 3...d4, 3...Nfd7 (transposing to the Steinitz variation of the French Defence after 4.d4 e6, but 4.e6!? is a sharp alternative), 3...Ne4!?, and even 3...Ng8. After 3...d4 can follow 4.Nce2 Ng4, or 4.exf6 dxc3 5.fxg7 cxd2+ leading to quick castling for White. While most grandmasters play the mainline 2.e5, Jonny Hector regularly plays 2.Nc3 against the Alekhine, and has scored well against the 2...d5 variation. His ideas have left White with a theoretical edge. Textbook authors of the Alekhine Defence, including Davies, Cox, and Taylor, have therefore encouraged 2...e5 over 2...d5.  Other 2nd moves for White  *2.d3, the Maroczy Variation, is less common. Although , 2.d3 blocks in White's light-squared bishop, so the variation is considered somewhat passive. If White fianchettoes that bishop, transposition to a King's Indian Attack is likely. Lev Alburt and Eric Schiller call 2.d3 \\"insipid\\" and recommend 2...d5 (or 3.Nd2 e5 with a reversed Philidor's Defence) 3.e5 Nfd7 4.f4 (4.d4 c5 5.c3 Nc6 leaves Black a tempo up on the French Defence) c5 5.Nf3 e6 6.g3!? Nc6 7.Bg2 Be7 8.0-0 b5 with .Lev Alburt and Eric Schiller, The Alekhine for the Tournament Player, American Chess Promotions, 1985, pp. 130‚Äì31. . *2.Qe2 e5 with an equal game. *2.Bc4, the Krejczik Variation, is rarely seen, since it allows Black to gain the and seize in the . Alburt and Schiller write that after 2...Nxe4 3.Bxf7+ (the Krejcik Gambit) Kxf7 4.Qh5+ Kg8 or 4...g6 5.Qd5+ e6 6.Qxe4 Bg7 7.Qf4 Ke8! \\"Black has nothing to worry about.\\"Alburt and Schiller 1985, p. 131. If Black does not want his king chased about, playable alternatives are 2...e5 (transposing to the Bishop's Opening), 2...d5 and 2...e6. *2.Bd3 aims to transpose into a Kopec System. *2.c4 gambits the e4-pawn in favour of superior development after 2...Nxe4 3.Nf3. While very rare, the line has been played a few times in grandmaster play, including a transposition to the King's Indian Defence after 2...g6 3.Nc3. *2.f3 is also rare, but players who like to play the black side of the Latvian Gambit can in effect wind up playing it after 1.e4 Nf6 2.f3 e5 3.f4!?.Taylor, chapter 10 Alekhine Declined *2.Nf3, the John Tracy Gambit, is a poor choice, leading to the loss of the for doubtful compensation.

It is on the River Goyt and southeast of Manchester, north of Macclesfield and southeast of Stockport. In 2011, it had a population of 23,686. Historically in Cheshire, the town lies along the Peak Forest Canal, containing the Marple Lock Flight and Marple Aqueduct. The Roman Lakes to the southeast of the town centre attracts anglers and walkers. Marple is served by two railway stations, Marple and Rose Hill, providing access to the rail network in Greater Manchester and beyond. It is also close to the Middlewood Way, a cycle path following the former Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway line south from Rose Hill to Macclesfield. History =Etymology= The first reference to Marple in written history was to Merpel, believed to be derived from the Old English maere pill, meaning 'the stream at the boundary'. =Early history= Scientists estimate that the earliest residents of the area settled several millennia ago. There are clues to their existence around the Ludworth area where there are standing stones and tumuli. This was confirmed around 1998 when an archaeological dig in Mellor revealed many clues about the existence of Marple's earliest residents. All Saints' Church, a grade II listed building from 1811 The area was predominantly within the Macclesfield Forest, and was omitted from the Domesday Book survey. The first mention of the area was in 1122 in a deed for the sale of land. In 1220 the land passed to the Vernon family where it remained for several generations. The pre-Industrial Revolution inhabitants of the village mostly worked on small farms and others specialised in linen weaving and hatting. After 1790, Samuel Oldknow transformed much of this lifestyle, with the construction of lime kilns and mills. This formed part of the Industrial Revolution. The population of the village began to rise with the construction of terraces to house mill workers and the formation of a village centre filled with private businesses. Samuel Oldknow also played a large role in the development of the town in addition to his mills; there is still a street named Oldknow Road in Marple today. He built workers' cottages and churches, introduced aspen trees to the area, and assisted in the constructions of the Macclesfield and Peak Forest Canals. Marple Aqueduct, which opened in 1800, carries the Peak Forest Canals over the River Goyt, was designed by Benjamin Outram, a pioneer in the building of canals and tramways. Seven men lost their lives during its construction. Samuel Oldknow died in 1828; his mill was destroyed by fire in 1892. These navigations accelerated Marple's growth, but eventually declined into disrepair when the railway arrived in 1865. They have since been restored for use by leisure narrowboats, now forming part of the Cheshire Ring. =Recent history= Footbridge over the River Goyt In the early 1900s the town prospered from the success of cotton in nearby Stockport and Manchester; the canals in the area served as a link with other industrial towns. In 1936, Marple Urban District, at the time part of Cheshire, annexed from Derbyshire the parish of Ludworth and Mellor. Marple grew as a residential suburb of Stockport after the arrival of frequent bus and rail services in the 1920s. Geography The area, close to Derbyshire, covers just over of countryside, ranging from heavily wooded valleys to hill-top moorland. It rises from around above sea level at the River Goyt to at Cobden Edge. On a clear day it is possible to view the Beetham Tower in Manchester as well as the city centre, the Winter Hill TV transmitter and the surrounding counties of Cheshire, Derbyshire, Lancashire and West Yorkshire and the mountains of North Wales from the top of these hills. Governance Motril, Spain, twinned with Marple In 1866 Marple became a civil parish in Cheshire and in 1894 the parish formed an urban district.Vision of Britain ‚Äì Marple parish (historic map) In 1974 the urban district was abolished and its former area was transferred to Greater Manchester to form part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport. Marple is represented on Stockport Borough Council in two three-member electoral wards called Marple North and Marple South by six councillors; four Liberal Democrats and two Conservatives. Stockport Borough Council has 63 councillors in 21 wards, of whom 26 are Liberal Democrats, 21 are Labour, 13 are Conservative, and 3 others, as of May 2015. For the United Kingdom Parliament, Marple is in the Hazel Grove constituency, which is represented by William Wragg, a Conservative, elected in 2015, gaining the seat from the Liberal Democrats. Marple is twinned with the town Motril in the province of Granada in Spain. =Public services= Water is supplied to the area by United Utilities. The nearest NHS hospital is Stepping Hill in Stockport, which is run by the Stockport NHS Foundation Trust. Marple has a police station, served by Greater Manchester Police, close to the library and Memorial Park. It also has a fire station, run by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, located behind the Asda supermarket in the town centre. Culture and community Regent Cinema, Marple Since 1932, Marple has had a cinema in a building designed in 1878 as a place of worship or refuge. The building was purchased in 1932 by the 'Marple Cinema Company' and became the Regent Cinema. It remains open as one of the few independent cinemas in the UK. The town has two brass bands: the Marple Band and the Hawk Green (Marple) Band. =Film appearances= In 2008, Marple was used as the setting for the BBC drama Sunshine. Marple featured in a 2010 BBC documentary on Dr Beeching which described the long-term effects of axing much of the UK railway network in the 1960s. The programme highlighted the transport issues and how getting a direct train from Marple to Stockport was now impossible and the road traffic made the journey one of the most difficult in the UK. Landmarks Junction of Peak Forest Canal and the Macclesfield Canal in Marple Marple is notable for its series of 16 canal locks, known as Marple Lock Flight, close to the village centre. The Peak Forest Canal skirts the village, north running alongside Marple Memorial Park and Brabyns Park until it reaches the Marple Aqueduct and on to Dukinfield Junction, and south towards Bugsworth Basin. Macclesfield Canal meets the Peak Forest Canal at Marple Junction, and heads towards Birmingham. The two canals form part of the Cheshire Ring canal system; the canals served as a vital link during the Industrial Revolution. Nowadays they provide an area of relaxation for walkers, anglers and boaters. The Roman Lakes leisure complex is popular with walkers, anglers, nature lovers and horse riders. It is located in the valley bottom close to Strines. The area was named in the Victorian era as an attraction to tourists not because it had links with the Romans (also true of Roman Bridge, a packhorse bridge over the Goyt). In the area closest to the river there was a mill built by Samuel Oldknow; it is now ruined and overgrown. In 2011, volunteers uncovered the wheelpit and entrance footings to the mill and are currently seeking funds to continue the exploration. The wheelpit, which when built was the largest in the world, is now viewable. The Middlewood Way is a 10-mile walking and cycling path between Marple and Macclesfield, following the line of the former Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway. =Marple Hall= Marple Hall is located close to where Marple Hall School now stands. The remains of the hall can be explored, though very little remains. The hall was the ancestral home of the Bradshaws and passed to the Isherwoods. It was demolished in 1959 after it was offered to the council in 1954 by the writer Christopher Isherwood, who had inherited it. By this time the hall had been ransacked by vandals and looters. Much of the estate is now residential housing or the school. The old hall foundations can be seen on the corner of Marple Hall Drive. There is a plaque on a piece of stone which is the only remaining lintel from the house. The shutters from its windows are restored and on display in Marple Library. The hall overlooked the River Goyt and it is still possible to walk from there to the river following a pathway which once led to the Dooley Lane entrance to the estate. Nearby Brabyn's Hall suffered a similar fate. Wyberslegh Hall, now in private ownership, stood ruined for a time. In a letter, Agatha Christie explained to a fan that whilst she was staying with a sister in Cheshire (her elder sister Margaret \\"Madge\\" had married Sir James Watt of Abney Hall) they went to a sale at Marple Hall. There Christie bought two Jacobean oak chairs which she still possessed at the time of writing, and wanting a name for her old maid character in The Thirteen Problems, she thought of Jane Marple.https://www.marplelocalhistorysociety.org.uk/stories-from-the- archive/stories-of-people/294-what-s-in-a-name.html Transport Rose Hill Marple railway station Stagecoach's 384 service towards Stockport The town lies along the A626, which runs between Glossop and Heaton Chapel. It has a junction in the centre of Marple with the B6101, which heads south to New Mills. =Public transport= The town falls within the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive area, with public transport provided by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM). Marple is served by two railway stations: Marple railway station and Rose Hill Marple railway station (originally on the now-defunct Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway). Both railway stations are now located on the Hope Valley Line, with both providing services to Manchester Piccadilly. The Agatha Christie character Miss Marple was often incorrectly thought to be named after the railway station, at which Christie was once delayed, but her grandson Matthew Pritchard cleared that up in July 2015 by bringing a letter to the station's 150th anniversary, which was coincidentally, the 125th anniversary of the author's birth. The actual source of the name was Marple Hall, as discussed in the Marple Hall section below. https://www.marplelocalhistorysociety.org.uk/stories-from-the-archive/stories- of-people/294-what-s-in-a-name.html The town has many bus services, most of which lead to Stockport via Offerton and Bredbury, and routes also provide links to Glossop, Stepping Hill Hospital, Hayfield and New Mills. Most routes are operated by Stagecoach Manchester and High Peak. Education Education in Marple is run by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. There are two primary schools, the secondary Marple Hall School which occupies the site of the ancestral home of the Bradshaw-Isherwood family. Marple Sixth Form College (formerly Ridge Danyers College) offers courses to young people and adults. There is also an independent school and nursery, Brabyns Preparatory School. Sport Marple Rugby Club has three adult teams, and a \\"Marple Minis Rugby\\" outfit with teams from age 7 to 17. Marple Cricket Club was formed in 1900 and has been based at Bowden Lane since 1951. The club is a member of the ECB Cheshire County Cricket League and its first team plays in the Premier Division. The club runs four senior teams, the first and second teams play on Saturdays and the third and fourth teams on Sundays. The club has a junior section. The cricket club built a squash section in the 1970s. The squash section has three courts and four teams playing regular club squash. Brabyns Tennis Club has four clay courts and three floodlit artificial grass courts, enabling year-round play. The club has several men's and ladies' teams in the Slazenger North East Cheshire League and mixed teams in the East Cheshire Winter League. There is a junior section and extensive coaching programme. Marple Golf Club, founded in 1892, is located in Hawk Green, Marple. It is an 18-hole private members' course.

It was the first major sea battle between ironclads and one of the last to involve deliberate ramming. The Italian navy fired roughly 1450 shots during the engagement, but failed to sink any Austrian ship while losing two ironclads. One of the main reasons for this poor performance was internal rivalry between the Italian fleet commanders: for example, Italian Vice Admiral Albini, with his ships, did not engage the enemy during the battle. The engagement was made up of several small battles: the main battle was between seven Austrian and four Italian ironclads and showed the ability of Austrian commander Tegetthoff to divide his more numerous opponents and then destroy the isolated ironclads. Background The battle occurred as part of the Third War of Italian Independence, in which Italy allied with Prussia in the course of its conflict against Austria. The major Italian objective was to capture Venice and at least part of its surrounds from Austria. The fleets were composed of a mix of unarmoured sailing ships with steam engines, and armoured ironclads also combining sails and steam engines. The Italian fleet of 12 ironclads and 17 unarmoured ships outnumbered the Austrian fleet of 7 and 11 respectively. The Austrians were also severely outmatched in rifled guns (276 to 121) and total weight of metal (53,236 tons to 23,538 tons).Stevens (1942), p. 257 A single turret ship took part in the action ‚Äî the Italian Affondatore. Piedmontese Count Carlo di Persano commanded the Italian fleet, while the Austrian fleet was commanded by Konteradmiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff. The fort on the island of Lissa was under the command of Oberst David Urs de Margina, an ethnic Romanian from Transylvania. The Italian fleet under Persano was divided into three divisions: Persano commanded the main battle force with 9 ironclads; his deputy, Albini, commanded a \\"support\\" division (engaged mainly in landings); and Admiral Vacca commanded a third \\"reserve\\" division with minor wooden ships. The attacking Austrian fleet was also split into three divisions. The 1st Division consisted of the armoured ships, while the 2nd consisted of the powerful but obsolete unarmoured wooden ship of the line and 5 frigates. The 3rd Division consisted of the smaller screw gunboats and armed merchantmen. The armed merchant cruiser Stadion was ahead of the fleet acting as a scout. The three Austrian divisions were formed up into three consecutive arrowhead or \\"V\\" formations; the armoured 1st division under Tegetthoff was in the van, the weaker gunboats and paddle steamers of the 3rd division to the rear, while the powerful but unarmoured vessels of Kommodor Petz's 2nd division were in the centre. The Austrian plan, due to their weaker firepower, was to close quickly into a mel√©e, and to use close range fire and ramming to sink a small portion of the Italian fleet, thereby breaking the Italian will to fight. The Italians, despite their numerical superiority, were not prepared for battle. They were busy preparing for landings on the island of Vis (Lissa) when the news that the Austrian fleet was at sea and seeking battle reached them. Persano cancelled the landings, ordered the fleet into line abreast but having second thoughts, cancelled that order (creating confusion among the Italian commanders) and ordered the fleet into three divisions in a line ahead formation, the same formation as at battles in the age of sail. The 1st division in the vanguard consisted of , and under Admiral Vacca, Captain 1st Class Fa√† di Bruno's 2nd division in the centre consisted of , and , and the 3rd division to the rear had the , and, at the extreme rear, Varese under Captain Augusto Riboty. In total, the Italians had 11 ironclads in the battle line. The other (wooden) ships were dispersed into the battleline. The exception was , which was on the far side of the 2nd squadron and out of the battleline. Persano may have intended this to be an uncommitted reserve. Before the battle Persano caused more confusion by deciding to transfer his flag to the and the 2nd and 3rd Divisions slowed to allow Re dItalia to lower her boats. However the signal to slow down never reached the 1st Division and they continued to steam on, allowing a gap to open in the Italian battle line. To compound the error Persano never signaled the change of flag, and throughout the action the Italians continued to look to the old flagship Re dItalia for orders rather than Affondatore. Battle Initial situation of the battle. Austrian ships are in red and Italian ships are in blue Having ignored warnings from his pickets of suspicious ships in sight, Persano had effectively allowed the Austrians to ambush his force while it was still forming. Tegetthoff, seeing a gap opening between the 1st and 2nd Divisions, forced his fleet into it and concentrated on raking the Italians and ramming. This meant that he allowed his T to be crossed. While the Austrians were approaching, Vacca's 1st Italian Division threw a heavy weight of fire at them. The Austrians could only reply with their chase guns. Because Persano was in the process of transferring his flag, no general order was given. The 2nd and 3rd Divisions did not join in and the Austrians crossed the killing area, suffering some serious damage but no ships were lost. Drache on the extreme right (starboard) wing of the Austrian 1st Division was hit 17 times by heavy shells, losing her mainmast and temporarily losing propulsion. Her captain, Heinrich von Moll, was decapitated by a heavy shell, but his subordinate, Karl Weyprecht, brought the ship back into the fight. By 10:43 am the Austrians had brought the Italian van to close action. , and on the Austrian left wing had engaged the Italian 1st Division, while the right wing of , and engaged the Italian 2nd Division. Persano, now on the most powerful warship in either fleet, Affondatore, stayed clear of the engagement.It has been pointed out the contradicting facts that the Affondatore was the most heavily hit Italian ship, and that even the Austrian battle report recognized that Persano exposed himself to the enemy fire (Storia Militare n. 215, Parma 2011, pp. 56‚Äì65) With the confusion in the Italian van, Kommodor von Petz took the opportunity to take his 2nd Division to the Italian rear and fall on their 3rd Division. The unarmoured wooden ships of the Austrian 2nd Division were facing modern ironclads armed with heavy guns, yet despite suffering heavy fire they held together. The screw frigate was hit 47 times, and her captain, Erik af Klint, was killed. was hit by a heavy shell below the waterline but still remained afloat, while was disabled by heavy Italian fire and set adrift. Seeing things going badly, Persano decided to ram the unarmoured screw battleship Kaiser rather than one of the armoured ships engaged with the Italian 2nd Division much nearer him. However, Kaiser managed to dodge Affondatore. Taking heart from his admiral, the captain of Re di Portogallo laid heavy fire on Kaiser with his rifled guns. At the last moment, von Petz turned into the ram, conducting a counter ram. The impact tore off Kaisers stem and bowsprit, leaving her figurehead embedded in Re di Portogallo. The Italian used the opportunity to rake Kaiser with fire, putting her mainmast and funnel into the sea. The smoke was so great that as they backed off for another ram they lost sight of each other and ended the duel. At roughly the same time, Tegetthoff threw his flagship Erzherzog Ferdinand Max (commanded by Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck) at first at the former Italian flagship, Re d'Italia, and then at Palestro. In both cases he scored only glancing blows, but these caused serious damage, especially to Palestro, which was dismasted and set afire. Tegetthoff (centre) at the Battle of Lissa, painting by Anton Romako. Palestros captain, Cappellini, pulled his ship out of the line. His crew refused to abandon their captain and Palestro finally blew up and sank at 2.30pm, with only 19 survivors out of a complement of 230. Meanwhile, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max was circling Fa√† di Bruno's , pouring on fire before surging forward and achieving a good impact with her ram, aided by the Italian having reversed in a poorly thought-out attempt to avoid crossing the Austrian's bows at the crucial moment. This put an hole below Re d'Italias waterline, and she struck her colours and sank two minutes later. According to legend, her captain shot himself after giving the order to strike the colours.Some eyewitnesses told that the captain jumped overboard; however, he drowned, being unable to swim. Storia Militare N. 215, pp. 64‚Äì65. As Erzherzog Ferdinand Max limped away, damaged after conducting three ramming attacks, Ancona closed on her attempting to ram. The Italian gunners got a full broadside off at point blank range, but while they had remembered the gunpowder, in the excitement they had forgotten to load the shot. After his encounter with Re di Portogallo earlier in the battle and having fought his way clear of Maria Pia, Kommodor von Petz's Kaiser found itself at close range with Affondatore. Despite being a perfect target for a ram, Kaiser survived when Persano ordered Affondatore to turn away.A participant to the battle explained this as being due to Affondatores turret poorly arrayed viewports, which led Persano and her captain to give confusing orders. Storia Militare n. 215, p. 61. Tegetthoff's victory was saluted by his mariners ‚Äì mainly Croats and Venetians, from Venetia, Istria and Dalmatia ‚Äì with the traditional Venetian cry of victory: \\"Viva San Marco!\\" (\\"Hurrah with Saint Mark!\\"). By 15:00, Tegetthoff had led his fleet into the harbour of Lissa, where the damaged Kaiser had already arrived, undisturbed by the Italian ships; despite Persano's orders to engage the Austrian vessels, both Albini and Vacca ignored the orders, as the latter candidly testified at Persano's trial.Storia Militare N. 215, p. 62 With his ships low on fuel and ammunition, and his crews spent, Persano led his fleet back towards his home port of Ancona. Kaisers encounter with Affondatore was the last major action of the battle. With two armoured ships sunk, the Italians withdrew, although there would be some exchange of long range fire for several hours.  Aftermath  In Italy, Persano announced a victory, causing much initial celebration until the real outcome of the battle was publicized. The outrage over the loss of two ironclads was huge and Persano after the battle was judged by the Italian Senate, condemned for incompetence and stripped of his rank, while Admiral Albini was merely relieved of command, and Admiral Vacca had to retire soon after for age limits.Storia Militare N. 215, pp. 63‚Äì65Bertoldi, Silvio. Sangue Sul Mare. (Mondadori 2006) Tegetthoff returned home a hero, was promoted Vizeadmiral, and is considered one of the greatest naval commanders in Austrian history. The Italian defeat was overshadowed by the crushing Prussian victory over the Austrian Army at K√∂niggr√§tz. Austria, humbled by Prussia and bullied by Napoleon III of France, agreed to cede Venetia to Italy despite the overall failure of the Italian war effort. Tegetthoff's efforts were instrumental in preventing the Italians from annexing some of the Dalmatian islands, which were once part of the Republic of Venice. The importance of ramming in the battle led to naval designers, over the next 50 years, equipping future warships (especially battleships and cruisers) with ram bows. This aggravated a number of incidents of ships being sunk by their squadron-mates in accidental collisions. Ramming never featured as a viable battle tactic again. The fixation on ramming may also have inhibited the development of gunnery. Modern commentators now take the view that Lissa occurred during a period of weapons development when armour was considerably stronger than the guns available to defeat it. This was compounded, on the Italian side, by poor gunnery and, on the Austrian side, by the fact that a number of their ships (including Ferdinand Max) had been forced to go into battle without their full armament owing to the Prussian embargo. Kaiser, remarkably, reported herself fit for action the morning after the battle. Her feat, an unarmored, wooden ship willingly engaging four ironclads at short range, appears to be unprecedented and was never repeated.

She was scrapped between 1893 and 1895. Alfredo Cappellini of Palestro was the namesake of an Italian armored gunboat launched in 1868 and an Italian monitor Alfredo Cappellini launched in 1915. Fa√† di Bruno of Re d'Italia was the namesake of an Italian armored gunboat launched in 1868 and a monitor launched in 1916. During World War II, an Italian submarine with his name was sunk in 1940 near Scotland. Augusto Riboty of Varese was the namesake of an Italian destroyer leader launched in 1916 (and which survived both world wars, finally being scrapped in 1951). Vizeadmiral von Tegetthoff was the namesake of an Austro-Hungarian center battery ironclad launched in 1878, a class of dreadnought battleships and the lead vessel of that class, launched in 1912. Ironically, at the end of World War I, the latter ship was given to the Italian Royal Navy, which in 1924‚Äì25 scrapped the ship that bore the name of the man who had defeated it in its first battle.

From 1993 to 2009, he was a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing and . In his congressional term, Knollenberg was known as a staunch supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement, President George W. Bush's stance on protecting manufactured goods and for voting against expanding SCHIP in the later years of his career. He was defeated by Gary Peters in the 2008 election by a margin of 52% to 43%. Early life Knollenberg was born in Mattoon, Illinois, the son of Helen E. (n√©e Kastl; 1903‚Äì1990), a teacher and William Herman Knollenberg Jr. (1902‚Äì1975), a farmer. He was raised a Catholic and grew up on a farm along with 12 siblings. He graduated from Eastern Illinois University in 1955. After graduation, he served in the United States Army from 1955 to 1957 as a corporal in Germany, where he specialized in petroleum chemistry. He then spent more than three decades as an insurance agent. Initially working for New York Life Insurance Company as an assistant manager and later for Sears, he founded his own agency, Knollenberg Agency in the late 1980s. He served as chairman of the Oakland County Republican Party from 1978 to 1982. Congressional career In 1992, Knollenberg signed on as campaign manager for Congressman William Broomfield, who had represented most of Oakland County in Congress since 1957. However, at a meeting with Knollenberg and other advisers, Broomfield announced he would not run for a 19th term. He then asked Knollenberg to run in his place in the 11th District, which had been renumbered from the 18th District after the 1990 census. Despite being the only candidate in the three-way Republican primary not holding elected office, Knollenberg won the nomination by over 13 points. As the 11th was one of the most Republican districts in Michigan and the nation at the time, he was virtually assured of becoming only the third person to represent the district. He was reelected six times without serious difficulty, never dropping below 55 percent of the vote. Knollenberg was re-elected to his seventh term in 2004 with 58% of the vote. In 2006, however, Knollenberg faced a tough campaign against Democrat Nancy Skinner, a liberal talk show host in the Detroit area, ultimately winning by six points. Two years later, in a more difficult election cycle for Republican candidates, Knollenberg lost re-election to former state senator Gary Peters. Generally, Knollenberg's voting record was conservative. He supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and led the campaign against President George W. Bush's steel tariffs. In 2002 he was awarded the Mkhitar Gosh Medal by the president of the Republic of Armenia. On September 29, 2008, he voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. =Committee assignments= *Appropriations Committee: Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (Ranking Member) =2006 election= Knollenberg (second to right) witnessing President George W. Bush signing the 'Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods' Act in 2006 Knollenberg was challenged in the 2006 Republican primary by moderate Republican Patricia Godchaux. Democratic candidate Nancy Skinner, a popular former radio-talk show host in the Detroit area, was her party's nominee for the 9th district. Matthew R. Abel of the Green Party and Adam Goodman of the Libertarian Party were third-party candidates also in the race. Prior to 2006, Knollenberg's election was widely considered to be relatively easy given the traditionally Republican leanings of Troy, the largest city in his district. The 2000s round of redistricting made Knollenberg's district much friendlier to Democrats. While the district lost heavily Democratic Southfield, it picked up equally Democratic Pontiac and lost a Republican-leaning spur of Wayne County. In the 2006 election, Knollenberg was nearly defeated, taking only 52 percent of the vote to Skinner's 46 percent. Abel received .9%, and Goodman received 1.3%. This was the closest a Democrat had come to winning the district in 48 years; in 1958 Broomfield only won a second term by 5.5 points. Knollenberg spent $2.7 million in his campaign. =2008 election= In January 2006, Congressman Knollenberg announced his intent to seek re-election in 2008. The narrowness of his 2006 reelection bid, combined with his district's changing demographics led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to target him for defeat. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee targeted Congressional Districts where Republicans garnered less than 55% of the vote. The Democratic nominee was Gary Peters, the former state lottery commissioner. Skinner initially made plans for a rematch, but bowed out to clear the field for Peters.\\"Skinner won't challenge Knollenberg\\". Detroit Free Press. February 25, 2008. In March 2008, Jack Kevorkian announced that he would challenge Knollenberg as an independent candidate.\\" Dr. Jack Kevorkian Will Run for US House as Independent\\", Ballot Access News, March 12, 2008 (accessed March 13, 2008). The Libertarian nominee was Adam Goodman and the Green nominee was Douglas Campbell. Kevorkian, Goodman and Campbell each raised and spent less money than the mandatory reporting threshold. On November 4, 2008, Knollenberg was defeated, garnering 43 percent of the vote to Peters' 52 percent. Knollenberg's candidacy was likely hurt by a heavy Democratic tide in the Detroit area; Barack Obama carried Oakland County by a 15-point margin, six percentage points more than Peters' margin over Knollenberg. A potential factor in Knollenberg's defeat was a series of advertisements criticizing his vote against expanding SCHIP. Personal life and death Knollenberg had two sons, Stephen and Martin with his wife, Sandra \\"Sandie\\" Moco, whom he married in September 1962 at St Frances Cabrini Church in Allen Park, Michigan. His son, Martin, was elected in November 2006 by a 58%-42% margin to the Michigan State House of Representatives from the 41st District. Knollenberg died on February 6, 2018, due to complications from Alzheimer's disease at a care facility in Troy, Michigan at the age of 84.

Graham played quarterback at the University of Notre Dame before transferring to Ohio State University. After his college football career, Graham had a lengthy career in the National Football League (NFL) during which he played for the New York Giants in two separate stints, as well as starting for the Arizona Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Steelers. He finished his career in 2002 with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Early years Graham attended Wheaton North High School in Wheaton, Illinois, where he was awarded the National High School Quarterback of the Year honor by The National Quarterback Club in 1986. Recruited by Notre Dame, he won his first career start for the Irish as a freshman against Boston College in 1987. However, the option-run offense implemented by coach Lou Holtz was an imperfect fit for the drop-back passer, and after his sophomore year he transferred to Ohio State, where he was the starter for the 1991 campaign in which the Buckeyes finished 8-4. Professional career Graham began his NFL career with the Giants in 1992, after the team drafted him in the eighth round of that year's NFL Draft. Due to injuries to starters Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler, Graham was forced into the starting lineup and started three games before he too was injured. He stayed with the team for two more years, only getting one more start, before leaving to play with the Detroit Lions in 1995. After not seeing any action, he signed with the Arizona Cardinals in 1996, where he eventually became the team's starting quarterback. In two separate stints as Cardinals quarterback, Graham threw for a combined 3,032 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. Graham returned to the Giants in 1998 to serve as backup to Danny Kanell, who had led the team to the NFC East title the previous year. He moved into the starting lineup in Week 12 after Kanell had led the Giants to a 3 - 7 record in the first ten games. Graham led the Giants to two wins in his first three starts, then secured a major upset over the then-undefeated and eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos in Week 15 by throwing a late touchdown pass to Amani Toomer to clinch the victory. Graham finished the season 5-1 as the team's starter, and won his final four starts. Graham started the 1999 season as the starter ahead of offseason acquisition Kerry Collins. He held a winning record in his nine starts, finishing 5-4, but struggled most of the year. After back-to-back ineffective performances he was benched during a Week 11 game against the Washington Redskins in favor of Collins. He did not see another snap as a Giant. Graham was released during the off-season (February 10, 2000) due to his lack of consistency and to create room under the salary cap. In February 2000 Graham was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers on a $5.1 million deal over three years to replace Mike Tomczak, who had been released in the off-season, as the backup for Kordell Stewart. In the wake of Stewart, who was having to cope with drastic changes to the offensive team members (including Tomczak, who had served as his mentor), having a mediocre 1999 season and a competitive first training camp, Steelers coach Bill Cowher (who, according to media rumors, was nearly fired by the Steelers organization for giving Stewart too many chances ) assigned Graham as the starting quarterback for the start of the 2000 season. Despite solid efforts, Graham performed less than impressive, beginning the season 0-3 due to Pittsburgh's defensive weaknesses. In the third game of the season vs. the Tennessee Titans, Graham threw for 254 yards in one of the best offensive showings for the Steelers in over two seasons before injuring his hip late in the game and being replaced by Stewart, who went on to lead the team to two straight victories as Graham recovered. This built a quarterback controversy among fans and media, as many of the Steeler faithful supported Graham ahead of Stewart despite Stewart's recent successes with the team (having led the team to the playoffs twice in his first two full years as starter). However, Graham struggled mightily upon his return to the Steelers and eventually lost whatever playing time he had earned. After platooning with Graham, Stewart returned to the starting position and Graham was cut at the end of the year. In 2001, he was signed by the Redskins. After initial starter Jeff George was cut, Graham became the team's second stringer for much of the season. In 2002, Graham was picked in the expansion draft by the Houston Texans to be their third-string quarterback. He never played again. Personal life His son, Taylor Graham, attended the New York Giants rookie minicamp in 2015 tryouts.

Early life  Jim Fitzpatrick was born in December 1944 to James and Elizabeth Fitzpatrick (n√©e O'Connor). His parents had married in the north Dublin suburb of Cabra in June 1943. During a period of childhood sickness, Fitzpatrick read and drew in bed, as well as his mother and great- aunt telling him stories of the Tuatha D√© Danann, C√∫ Chulainn and Fionn MacCumhaill. He was educated at the Franciscan College Gormanston, County Meath, just north of Dublin. His father was a photo-journalist and he is a grandson of political cartoonist Thomas Fitzpatrick.  Career  Portrait of Che Guevara (1968) Fitzpatrick's earliest work was the graphic portrait of Che Guevara, which was based on the photograph by Alberto Korda, entitled Guerrillero Heroico, was taken on 5 March 1960. Fitzpatrick met Guevara 5 years earlier in Kilkee Irish artist who made iconic Che Guevara image is selling his beachfront home In: The Independent, July 6 2018 during Guevara's visit to trace his Irish ancestry. Having initially tried to distribute the poster himself, Fitzpatrick chose to remove copyright from the image so that is could be used freely by left wing groups, stating that \\"I literally wanted it to breed like rabbits. I wanted it to spread.\\" In 1978, he wrote and illustrated a book called The Book of Conquests, the retelling of a cycle of Irish myths, the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn. The book is a retelling of the legends of the coming of the Tuatha d√© Dannan to Ireland and their fight with the Fir Bolg. The illustrations include intricate Celtic scroll work and knotwork, for which Fitzpatrick has become known. A second book, The Silver Arm, is based on the deeds of Nuada of the Silver Arm and Lugh in their fight with the Formor. Fitzpatrick has produced artwork for bands such as Thin Lizzy including their Jailbreak album in 1976, for Sin√©ad O'Connor's 2000 album Faith and Courage, for The Darkness' 2003 single \\"Christmas Time (Don't Let the Bells End)\\", Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone's 2013 album cover The Underground Resistance, and took the photograph for the cover of Louise Patricia Crane's 2020 album Deep Blue. He was commissioned by CityJet in 2007 to create images reflecting Ireland's culture, mythology, history and landscapes. In 2011, Fitzpatrick announced that he intended to copyright the iconic red and black Che Guevara graphic. He cited \\"crass commercial\\" use of the image for his decision and planned to hand over the copyright and all rights, in perpetuity, to the family of Guevara in Cuba.Humphries, Conor. \\"Irish artist bids to copyright Guevara image\\". Reuters. February 17, 2011. Retrieved 2011-3-1. The image remains available for free through Fitzpatrick's website for non- commercial usage. An Post released a stamp featuring Fitzpatrick's image of Guevara in 2017 to mark 50 years since its publication.  Meeting Guevara in Ireland  According to Fitzpatrick, in 1963 while a teenage student at Gormanston College he worked a summer job at the Marine Hotel pub in Kilkee, the remote town of his mother's birth. One morning Che Guevara walked in with two Cubans and ordered an Irish whiskey. Fitzpatrick immediately recognized him because of his interest in the Cuban Revolution. Knowing about the Irish diaspora and history in Argentina, Fitzpatrick asked Che vaguely about his roots. Che told Fitzpatrick that his grandmother was Irish and that his great- grandmother, Isabel, was from Galway, with other family being from Cork.Guevara's father also bore the Irish surname \\"Lynch.\\" Fitzpatrick describes Che as \\"curious\\" about Ireland \\"from a revolutionary point of view\\" and remarks that Che proclaimed his \\"great admiration\\" for the fact that, in his view, Ireland was the first country to \\"shake off the shackles of the British Empire\\". Apparently Che was stranded on an overnight flight from Moscow to Cuba, and had touched down at Shannon Airport, where the Soviet airline Aeroflot had a refueling base. Unable to depart because of thick fog, Che and his accompanying Cubans took the day off for an \\"unofficial\\" visit. It was this experience, according to Fitzpatrick, that gave him the impetus to follow the future actions of Che, including his ill-fated mission to Bolivia. In December 2008, Jim Fitzpatrick, along with local historian Anne Holliday and the Shannon Development, announced plans to commemorate Guevara's visit to Ireland, and specifically his time spent in Limerick. Early plans are focused on an exhibition of Guevara's visit at the City Museum, followed by the creation of a \\"permanent mark\\" symbolizing his time spent at Hanratty Hotel's ‚Äì White House pub in Shannonside. Fitzpatrick defended the move by remarking \\"we want to commemorate the fact Che Guevara spent some very important hours of his life here ‚Ä¶ this probably was Che's last hurrah.\\"Marking Che Guevara's Limerick Link Limerick Leader, December 4, 2008  Selected works  = Books = * The Book of Conquests 1978 p/b , 1991 p/b * The Silver Arm (1981) * The Children of Lir (with Michael Scott) (1992) * Erinsaga.

They are the only remaining private army in Europe, and act as the personal bodyguard to the Duke of Atholl; Chieftain of the Clan Murray, a family that has thrived in Perthshire for some 750 years. Although it has no official military role, this hand-picked body of local men are armed with Lee Metford rifles, and the regiment includes a pipe band. Joining the Highlanders is by invitation-only from the Duke, who specially selects men with ties to the estate or the local area. The regiment is not part of the British Army but under the command of the Duke of Atholl, and based in at Blair Castle, Blair Atholl. History =First raising as a regular regiment in the British Army= The regiment was raised in Perthshire by John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl as the 77th Regiment of Foot (or Atholl Highlanders, or Murray's Highlanders) in December 1777. The regiment was formed as a relief for other regiments serving in North America, and spent most of its existence in Ireland. The terms upon which the regiment was raised stated that the men were to be employed for either three years or the duration of the war in America. In 1781, the original three-year term ended, and the men expected the regiment to be disbanded. However, the regiment was transported to England and marched to Portsmouth to be embarked for service in India. Upon learning of this, the men mutinied, and the embarkation orders were countermanded. The regiment was marched to Berwick, where it disbanded in 1783. =Second raising as a private regiment of the Duke of Atholl= The Atholl Highlanders on parade in 2017 The full dress of the Atholl Highlanders More than 50 years later, in 1839, George Murray, 6th Duke of Atholl, as Lord Glenlyon, formed the regiment as a bodyguard which he took to the Eglinton Tournament at Eglinton Castle, Ayrshire. Three years later, in 1842, the regiment escorted Queen Victoria during her tour of Perthshire and, in 1844, when the Queen stayed as a guest of the Duke at Blair Castle, the regiment mounted the guard for the entire duration of her stay. In recognition of the service that the regiment provided during her two visits, the Queen announced that she would present the Atholl Highlanders with colours, thus giving the regiment official status, in perpetuity. The regiment's first stand of colours was presented by Lady Glenlyon in 1845. It received new colours in 1979 from Mrs David Butter, the wife of the Lord Lieutenant of Perth and Kinross. A third stand of colours was presented in 2006 by the Duchess of Atholl. Under the John Stewart-Murray, 7th Duke, the regiment regularly provided guards for royal visitors to Blair Castle (which was a convenient stopping point on the journey to Balmoral). The regiment also attended the Braemar Gathering, while an annual Atholl gathering was held in the first week in September in which the regiment paraded, then participated in various trials of strength and stamina. Following the First World War, parades of the regiment became fewer, although it did provide guards when the Crown Prince of Japan and King Faisal of Iraq visited Blair Castle in 1921 and 1933 respectively. After many years of inactivity the regiment remained in abeyance until in 1966, when it was reformed by Iain Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl. The 10th Duke made the decision to revive the regiment‚Äôs annual parade. To this effect eight local men mostly estate employees and all with previous military service training were invited to join, seven accepted. They paraded on 8 April 1966 at Blair Castle for the first time in 33 years. They marched past the Duke led by two Atholl Highlander pipers. In 1973 the regiment returned to the Braemar Gathering and took part in a march past in front of the Queen and other members of the royal family. The Atholl Gathering was re-introduced at Target Park in June 1984. It was feared that the regiment would be disbanded following the 10th Duke's death in 1996, until his successor, John Murray, 11th Duke of Atholl, wrote to the estate trustees insisting that he would continue his traditional role.Daily Mirror, March 20, 1996 The 11th Duke, although resident in South Africa, visited Blair Atholl almost every year to inspect the regiment's annual parade until his death. The 12th Duke continues this tradition. The Atholl Highlanders continue with the current Bruce Murray, 12th Duke of Atholl, as their Colonel in Chief.

Nf3 d5 :2. c4 White plans to bring the d5-pawn under attack from the , or entice it to advance to d4 and undermine it later. White will couple this plan with a kingside fianchetto (g3 and Bg2) to create pressure on the light squares in the . The opening is named after Czechoslovakian Richard R√©ti (1889‚Äì1929). The opening is in the spirit of the hypermodernism movement that R√©ti championed, with the center being dominated from the wings rather than by direct occupation. 1.Nf3 develops the knight to a good square, prepares for quick castling, and prevents Black from occupying the center by 1...e5. White maintains flexibility by not committing to a particular central pawn structure, while waiting to see what Black will do. But the R√©ti should not be thought of as a single opening sequence, and certainly not a single opening move, but rather as an opening complex with many variations sharing common themes. In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO), R√©ti Opening is classified as codes A04‚ÄìA09. History Scoresheet of R√©ti‚ÄìCapablanca, New York 1924 According to R√©ti the opening was introduced into master play in the early part of 1923.Schiller, Eric (1988). How to Play the R√©ti. Coraopolis, Pennsylvania: Chess Enterprises, Inc. . R√©ti used the opening most famously to defeat Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca, the reigning World Chess Champion, in a game at the 1924 New York tournament.Richard Reti vs Jose Raul Capablanca, New York 1924 Alexander Alekhine played the R√©ti in the 1920s, but at that time almost any game that began with Nf3 and c4 by White was considered to be the R√©ti. R√©ti popularized these moves against all defenses in the spirit of hypermodernism, and as the opening developed it gained structure and a clearer distinction between it and other openings. Hans Kmoch called the system of attack employed by R√©ti in the game R√©ti‚ÄìRubinstein, Carlsbad 1923,Richard Reti vs Akiba Rubinstein, Karlsbad 1923 \\"the R√©ti Opening\\" or \\"the R√©ti System\\". Savielly Tartakower called the opening the \\"R√©ti‚ÄìZukertort Opening\\", and said of 1.Nf3: \\"An opening of the past, which became, towards 1923, the opening of the future.\\" Classic method: 2.c4  In modern times the R√©ti refers only to the configuration Nf3 and c4 by White with ...d5 by Black, where White fianchettos at least one bishop and does not play an early d4.Modern Chess Openings, 15th edition, by Nick de Firmian, , p. 718 After 2.c4 (ECO code A09), Black's choices are: * 2...e6 or 2...c6 (holding the d5-point) * 2...dxc4 (giving up the d5-point) * 2...d4 (pushing the pawn) If Black takes the pawn, then in the same manner as the QGA, 3.e3 or 3.e4 regain the pawn with a slight advantage to White, as Black is left somewhat undeveloped. 3.Na3 and 3.Qa4+ are also good, and commonly played. This variety of White options limits the popularity of 2...dxc4. Trying to protect the pawn with 3...b5?! allows 4.a4! leaving white with a superior position. The alternatives - 2...d4, 2...c6, and 2...e6 - are more common, with the latter two generally leading to a Queen's Gambit type of position, and 2...d4 typically being answered with 3.e3 (sometimes leading to the Blumenfeld Gambit) or the interesting 3.b4!?

After 4...Be7, White can play 5.d4, transposing to a Closed Catalan.

Champions of the South Western League, whose last principal sponsor was the Carlsberg beer brand via St. Austell Brewery, were eligible for promotion to the lower division of the Western League, but the difficulties Cornish teams have travelling further afield have discouraged applications for promotion.

An imperial clansman of the house of Aisin Gioro, he began his career in the Imperial Clan Court. He conducted several peace treaties with Western powers, beginning with the Treaty of Nanking, which ended the First Opium War with Britain in 1842. Keying was sent to negotiate again in 1858 to settle the Arrow War with Britain and France, but the settlement was repudiated by the Daoguang Emperor and he was forced to commit suicide.  Early career  Keying was born on 21 March 1787.Gao Zhonghua (2005). Sushun yu Xianfeng zhengju. Jinan: Qilu shushe. p. 165, n. 1. A descendant of Nurhaci's ninth son Babutai (Duke Kexi of the First Rank), Keying was a member of the imperial house of Aisin Gioro, and belonged to the Manchu Plain Blue Banner in the Eight Banners. He held several prominent posts in the Qing government and was demoted several times because of corruption in office, but managed to regain his position as a leading official in the Qing court.  Opium Wars  Formal reception of Keying in Hong Kong, November 1845 In 1842, the Daoguang Emperor entrusted Keying to conclude a peace treaty with the Britain following the First Opium War, and he was chiefly responsible for negotiating and signing the Treaty of Nanking. The following year, he signed the Treaty of the Bogue to supplement the Treaty of Nanking. He also concluded the Treaty of Wanghia (1844) with the United States, the Treaty of Whampoa (1844) with France, and the Treaty of Canton (1847) with Sweden-Norway. This is the first group of what the Chinese later called the unequal treaties. In November 1845, Keying was well received in Hong Kong.Curiosities of Modern Travel: A Year-book of Adventure. London: David Bogue. 1847. p. 69. In 1858, the Xianfeng Emperor ordered Keying to negotiate a peace treaty with Britain and France to conclude the Second Opium War. During the negotiations, the British interpreters Horatio Nelson Lay and Thomas Francis Wade sought to expose Keying's duplicity by producing documents the British had captured in Guangzhou, in which Keying expressed his contempt for the British. Humiliated, Keying promptly left the negotiations in Tianjin for Beijing and he was later arrested for having left his post in contravention of imperial order.

Today, the valley's wines are protected by the U.S. Federal Government's Sonoma Valley and Carneros AVAs (or American Viticultural Areas). Sonoma Valley offers a wide range of year-round festivals and events, including the Sonoma International Film Festival. Points of interest include the Quarryhill Botanic Garden, Mission San Francisco Solano, Jack London State Historic Park, Sonoma State Historic Park and the Blue Wing Inn of 1840. Geography The valley is located in southeastern Sonoma County between the Mayacamas Mountains and Sonoma Mountains. It stretches from San Pablo Bay in the south to the city of Santa Rosa in the north. Sonoma Creek flows down the valley to the bay. The area includes the incorporated city of Sonoma and part of the city of Santa Rosa, as well as numerous unincorporated communities, including Kenwood and Glen Ellen near Santa Rosa and, near Sonoma, El Verano, Boyes Hot Springs, Fetters Hot Springs, and Agua Caliente. History Once a valley of the coastal Miwok, Pomo and Wintun peoples, called the \\"Valley of the Moon\\" in their legends, the valley was selected by the Franciscan order of Spain as the site to build the Mission San Francisco Solano, the northernmost mission in their chain of twenty-one missions built in Alta California. Established in 1823 and named to honor St. Francis Solanus, Mission Solano was the sole California mission established under the rule of a newly independent Mexico. Within two generations of the Spaniards' arrival, however, the indigenous societies of the region were dispossessed of their land and decimated by diseases to which Europeans were resistant. Soon after the Sonoma mission was built, it was secularized by the Mexican government, and, under the orders of Lieutenant, later General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, el Pueblo de Sonoma (the town of Sonoma) was laid out in the standard form of a Mexican town, centered around the historic plaza, which is still the town's focal point. Also known as \\"Valley of the Seven Moons\\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb9MZKfQYcQ The raising of the first California Bear Flag and Vallejo's arrest in 1846 by a band of Americans claiming to act on the orders of Col. John C. Fremont was the initial act that founded the Bear Flag Republic. Vallejo later transferred his allegiance with US statehood (1850), and with his amassed land holdings guided the development of the town and dispensed large ranches throughout the valley. California's first wineries were established here, including Buena Vista Winery (1857) and Gundlach Bundschu (1858). The other communities in the valley, such as Kenwood, Glen Ellen, Schellville, and Boyes Hot Springs, were founded later in the 19th century, some as resorts centered on the geothermic hot springs that still well up from deep within the earth. Boyes Hot Springs and Agua Caliente were popular health retreats for tourists from San Francisco and points beyond until the middle of the 20th century. Today the Sonoma Mission Inn in Boyes Hot Springs remains as a main destination resort, and the wineries, the historic sites, and the area's natural beauty are the main tourist attractions. In October 2017, Sonoma Valley was badly affected by the Tubbs Fire. Origin of the name The phrase \\"Valley of the Moon\\" was first recorded in an 1850 report by General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo to the California Legislature. According to Jack London, who had a ranch there, the Native American word Sonoma means \\"valley of the moon.\\" He used it for his book of the same name. But there are several other possible translations for Sonoma (see Sonoma County, California). According to the Miwok tribes that lived in the valley, and the Pomo, it meant \\"valley of the moon\\" or \\"many moons.\\" White settlers may have accidentally translated the words \\"many moons\\" into \\"valley of moons.\\" Miwok legends say that the moon seemingly rose from this valley, or was \\"nestled\\" in the valley, or may have even sprung up multiple times in one night. In the native languages there is also a constantly recurring ending tso-noma, from tso, the earth; and noma, village; hence tsonoma, \\"earth village.\\"Alfred Louis Kroeber, Handbook of the Indians of California, Dover Publications, New York City, N.Y. (1976) Other sources say Sonoma comes from the Patwin tribes west of the Sacramento River, and their Wintu word for \\"nose.\\" Per California Place Names, \\"the name is doubtless derived from a Patwin word for 'nose', which Padre Arroyo (Vocabularies, p. 22) gives as sonom (Suisun).\\" Spaniards may have found an Indian chief with a prominent protuberance and applied the nickname of Chief Nose to the village and the territory.Alfred L. Kroeber, AAE 29:354 [1932] The name may have applied originally to a nose-shaped geographic feature. Geology The Sonoma Valley is part of the Coast Range Physiographic provence. Basement rocks that make up the valley at great depth are the Great Valley Sequence shale, sandstone and conglomerate deposited in a continental slope- to abysmal plain environment via turbidite flows. The Cretaceous Great Valley Sequence overlies and contacts the Franciscan Complex along the Coast Range Thrust. The Jurassic-Cretaceous Franciscan Complex includes crumpled, uplifted terranes that have resulted from the subduction of the former oceanic Farallon Plate under the North American continent. During late Miocene- Pliocene time (~10 to ~4 million years) the area was attended by volcanism (Late Miocene Tolay Volcanics and Late Miocene - Pliocene Sonoma Volcanics) which are interbedded with the late Miocene-Pliocene Petaluma Formation. The (~9 to 4 million year old) Petaluma Formation was a fresh-water river system flowing from east to west and through the volcanics. At that time, volcanic lava flows and river sands and gravels were actively deposited together, hence \\"interbedded lavas and gravels\\". The volcanoes may have been similar to island arcs. The Petaluma Formation is found in outcrop from Sears Point to Santa Rosa (through Sonoma Mountain) and as far west as Cotati where it interfingers with a marine sandstone called the Wilson Grove Formation. Gravels in the Petaluma Formation did not come from rocks located in Napa, but have been sourced to mountains east of San Jose, California. This does not mean rivers flowed northward from San Jose to Sonoma; rather, strike-slip movement along the Hayward-Sonoma Valley-Carneros fault system has dislocated present-day Sonoma County north and away from the mountains in San Jose where the basin formed. The valley is drained by Sonoma Creek, whose headwaters rise in Sugarloaf Mountain State Park and discharge into the San Pablo Bay at the Napa Sonoma Marsh. Some of the principal tributaries to Sonoma Creek are Yulupa Creek, Graham Creek, Calabazas Creek, Bear Creek, Schell Creek and Carriger Creek. = Hydrogeology = In spring 2006, the United States Geological Survey in conjunction with the Sonoma County Water Agency completed a comprehensive basin-wide groundwater study to characterize groundwater resources in the Sonoma Valley. The report can be obtained on the USGS publications website. Currently, a Basin Advisory Panel, composed of stakeholders from agriculture, environmental groups, domestic well owners, municipalities and government is working to develop a groundwater management plan to protect groundwater resources in the valley.

It often leads to good endgames for Black, who has the better pawn structure. History The opening is named after the English player Horatio Caro and the Austrian player Marcus Kann who analysed it in 1886. Kann scored an impressive 24-move victory with the Caro‚ÄìKann Defence against German- British chess champion Jacques Mieses at the 4th German Chess Congress in Hamburg in May 1885: :1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 4.Bd3 Bxd3 5.Qxd3 e6 6.f4 c5 7.c3 Nc6 8.Nf3 Qb6 9.0-0 Nh6 10.b3 cxd4 11.cxd4 Nf5 12.Bb2 Rc8 13.a3 Ncxd4 14.Nxd4 Bc5 15.Rd1 Nxd4 16.Bxd4 Bxd4+ 17.Qxd4 Rc1 18.Kf2 Rxd1 19.Qxb6 axb6 20.Ke2 Rc1 21.Kd2 Rg1 22.g3 Kd7 23.a4 Rc8 24.b4 Rcc1 Jacques Mieses vs. Marcus Kann, Hamburg 1885 Chessgames.com Main line: 2.d4 d5 After 2.d4 d5 the most common moves are 3.Nc3 (Classical and Modern variations), 3.Nd2 (usually transposing into 3.Nc3), 3.exd5 (Exchange Variation), and 3.e5 (Advance Variation). =3.Nc3 and 3.Nd2= 3.Nc3 and 3.Nd2 usually transpose into each other after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4. Since the 1970s, 3.Nd2 has increased in popularity to avoid the Gurgenidze Variation (3.Nc3 g6); however, some players choose to allow it. Classical Variation: 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5  The most common way of handling the Caro‚ÄìKann, the Classical Variation (often referred to as the Capablanca Variation after Cuban grandmaster Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca), is defined by the moves: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 (or 3.Nd2) dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5. This was long considered to represent best play for both sides in the Caro‚ÄìKann. White usually continues: 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 h6 7.Nf3 Nd7 8.h5 Bh7 9.Bd3 Bxd3 10.Qxd3. Although White's pawn on h5 looks ready to attack, it can prove to be a weakness in an endgame.Schiller, p. 33 Much of the Caro‚ÄìKann's reputation as a defence stems from this variation. Black makes very few compromises in pawn structure and plays a timely ...c6‚Äìc5 to contest the d4-square. Variations with Black castling gave the Caro‚ÄìKann its reputation of being solid but somewhat boring. More popular recently are variations with Black castling and even leaving his king in the .

Retrieved on 2009-10-30. Modern Variation: 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7  Another solid line, this variation is characterised by the moves: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 (or 3.Nd2) dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7. At one time named after the first world champion Wilhelm Steinitz, nowadays the variation is variously referred to as the Smyslov Variation after the seventh world champion Vasily Smyslov who played a number of notable games with it, the Karpov Variation, after the twelfth world champion Anatoly Karpov, in whose repertoire it appeared quite often, or, most commonly, the Modern Variation. The short-term goal of 4...Nd7 is to ease by the early exchange of a pair of knights without compromising the structural integrity of Black's position. Play is similar to the Classical Variation except that Black has more freedom by delaying the development of his bishop, and is not forced to play it to the g6-square. However, this freedom comes at a cost as White enjoys added freedom in taking up space in the centre, and often plays the aggressive 5.Ng5 where Black's development is brought into question as well as the positional weakness of the f7-square. The famous last game of the Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov rematch where Kasparov committed a known blunder and lost was played in this very line. Specialist knowledge is a must to play this opening. Otherwise Black could fall prey to early attacks such as the quick mating for White, 5.Qe2 followed by 6.Nd6#. 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Nxf6+ The Bronstein‚ÄìLarsen Variation and Korchnoi Variation both begin with the moves: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6!? 5.Nxf6+. =Bronstein‚ÄìLarsen Variation: 5...gxf6 = Black has voluntarily opted for an inferior pawn structure and a practical necessity of castling queenside, while gaining dynamic compensation in the form of the open g-file for the rook and unusually active play for the Caro‚ÄìKann. It is generally considered somewhat unsound, though world championship challenger David Bronstein and former world championship candidate Bent Larsen employed it with some success. =Korchnoi Variation: 5...exf6 = Viktor Korchnoi played 5...exf6 many times (including his first world championship match with Anatoly Karpov), and this line has also been employed by Ulf Andersson. Black's 5...exf6 is regarded as sounder than 5...gxf6!? of the Bronstein‚ÄìLarsen Variation and offers Black rapid development, though also ceding White the superior pawn structure and long-term prospects (Black has to be cautious that the d-pawn is now a potential passed pawn in the endgame). Gurgenidze Variation: 3.Nc3 g6  The Gurgenidze Variation is 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 g6. Black prepares to fianchetto the bishop on g7, creating pressure against White's d4-pawn. After 4.Nf3 Bg7 White usually plays 5.h3 to prevent the ...Bg4 pin. This variation, originated by Bukhuti Gurgenidze, led to a rise in the popularity of 3.Nd2 during the 1970s. After 3.Nd2, 3...g6 is met by 4.c3, when the fianchettoed bishop has little to do. 3.Nd2 will usually transpose into the Classical Variation after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4. =Advance Variation: 3.e5 = The 3...Bf5 variation that follows with 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 has gained popularity after having previously been widely regarded as inferior for many years, owing chiefly to the strategic demolition that Aron Nimzowitsch (playing as White) suffered at the hands of Jos√© Capablanca in one of their games at the New York 1927 tournament.Nimzowitsch vs. Capablanca, New York 1927 Chessgames.com The Advance Variation has since been revitalized by aggressive lines such as the Bayonet Attack (4.Nc3 e6 5.g4), a popular line in the 1980s and later favoured by Latvian grandmaster Alexei Shirov, or the less ambitious variation 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 c5 6.Be3, popularised by English grandmaster Nigel Short and often seen in the 1990s. Another less popular but aggressive line is the Tal variation (4.h4 h5), popularised by grandmaster Mikhail Tal. The 3...c5 variation that follows with 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5!? is an important alternative and avoids the weight of theory associated with 3...Bf5. It was used by Mikhail Botvinnik in his 1961 match versus Mikhail Tal (though with a negative outcome for Botvinnik ‚Äì two draws and a loss). The line was christened the \\"Arkell/Khenkin Variation\\" in the leading chess magazine New in Chess yearbook 42 in recognition of the work these two grandmasters did and the success they were having with the variation. In comparison to the French Defence, Black lacks the tempo normally spent on ...e6; however, White can only exploit this by the weakening of his own central with 4. dxc5 when Black has good chances of regaining the pawn. =Exchange Variation: 3.exd5 cxd5 = The Exchange Variation is 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5. Main line: 4.Bd3 The Exchange Variation begins with 4.Bd3 (to prevent ...Bf5 while still developing) 4...Nc6 5.c3 Nf6 6.Bf4 Bg4 7.Qb3. This line is considered to offer equal chances, and was tried by Bobby Fischer. Some of the strategic ideas are analogous to the Queen's Gambit Declined, Exchange Variation, (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5) with colours reversed. Panov‚ÄìBotvinnik Attack: 4.c4  The Panov‚ÄìBotvinnik Attack begins with the move 4.c4. It is named after Vasily Panov and the world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. This system often leads to typical (IQP) positions, with White obtaining rapid development, a grip on e5, and kingside attacking chances to compensate for the long-term structural weakness of the isolated d4-pawn. The major variation in this line is 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.Nf3, when Black's main alternatives are 6...Bb4 (a position often transposing into lines of the Nimzo-Indian Defence) and 6...Be7, once the most common line. 6...Nc6?! is inferior as it is favourably met by 7.c5!, after which White plans on seizing the e5-square by advancing the b-pawn to b5, or by exchanging the black knight on c6 after Bb5. =Tartakower or Fantasy Variation: 3.f3 = The Tartakower or Fantasy Variation, 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.f3, somewhat resembles the Blackmar‚ÄìDiemer Gambit. 3...e6 is probably the most solid response, preparing to exploit the dark squares via ...c5, though 3....g6 has been tried by Yasser Seirawan. GM Lars Schandorff and GM Sam Shankland both prefer 3...dxe4 4.fxe4 e5 5.Nf3 Bg4 6.Bc4 Nd7 7.0-0 Ngf6 8.c3 Bd6 with play being sharp and double-edged, though recent theory suggest that 7.c3! is more critical, giving a small objective advantage for White. Interesting, though probably insufficient is 3...e5. This so-called 'Twisted Fantasy Variation' aims to exploit White's weaknesses on the a7‚Äìg1 diagonal, an idea similar to 3...Qb6, a variation championed by Baadur Jobava. Related to the Fantasy Variation are the gambits 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.f3, originated by Sir Stuart Milner-Barry, and 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Bc4 Nf6 5.f3 (von Hennig). Two Knights Variation: 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 (or 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3)  The Two Knights Variation 1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 (or 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3) was played by Bobby Fischer in his youth, but has since declined in popularity. White's intention is to benefit from rapid development as well as to retain options regarding the d-pawn. Black's logical and probably best reply is 3...Bg4. After 4.h3 Bxf3 5.Qxf3, the positional continuation, Black has the option of 5...Nf6 or 5...e6. The Retreat Line 4...Bh5 is but Black must be careful. In Noteboom‚ÄìMindeno 1927 Black lost quickly after 5.exd5 cxd5 6.g4 Bg6 7.Ne5 a6? (7...Nc6 is necessary) 8.h4 d4 9.h5! dxc3 10.hxg6 cxd2+ 11.Qxd2 Qxd2+ 12.Bxd2 and Black must lose .Noteboom vs. Mindeno, Holland 1927 Chessgames.com This variation sets a trap: if Black plays along the lines of the Classical Variation, he gets in trouble after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 (4...Nd7 is playable) 5.Ng3 Bg6?!

Black will probably play 2...d5 (see 1.e4 c6 2.c4 d5). This can transpose to the Panov‚ÄìBotvinnik (B14, given above, with 3.exd5 cxd5 4.d4) or Caro‚ÄìKann (B10, with the double capture on d5). Alternatively, Black may play 2...e5, the Open Variation (see 1.e4 c6 2.c4 e5). The 2.c4 line can also arise by transposition from the English Opening: 1.c4 c6 2.e4.

The swelling most commonly affects the arms, legs, face, intestinal tract, and airway and is usually not itchy. If the intestinal tract is affected, abdominal pain and vomiting may occur. Swelling of the airway can result in its obstruction. Without preventive treatment, attacks typically occur every two weeks and last for a few days. There are three main types of HAE. Types I and II are caused by a mutation in the SERPING1 gene, which makes the C1 inhibitor protein, while type III is often due to a mutation in the F12 (factor XII) gene. The result is increased levels of bradykinin, which promotes swelling. The condition may be inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal dominant manner or occur as a new mutation. Triggers for an attack may include minor trauma or stress, but attacks often occur without any obvious preceding event. Diagnosis of types I and II is based on measurement of C4 and C1-inhibitor levels. Management of HAE involves efforts to prevent attacks and the treatment of attacks if they occur. During an attack, supportive care such as intravenous fluids and airway support may be required. C1 inhibitor medications can be used for both prevention and treatment, while ecallantide and icatibant can be used to treat acute attacks. HAE affects approximately 1 in 50,000 people. The condition is typically first noticed in childhood. Type I and II affected females and males equally, while type III affects females more often than males. When the airway is involved, without treatment, the risk of death is about 25%. With treatment, outcomes are generally good. The condition was first described in 1888 by Canadian physician William Osler. Signs and symptoms Symptoms generally begin around puberty but can occur earlier. These individuals have recurrent swelling in the extremities, genitals, face, lips, larynx or GI tract. Some patients describe a sensation of fullness but not pain or itching in the affected area except for those with abdominal swellings who often experience acute abdominal pain. Others experience an intense amount of pain, described as radiating from the bone outward along with intense itching just beneath the skin and intense heat, regardless of the area targeted. Instances of swelling around the throat or larynx can cause difficulties in breathing should the swelling obstruct airways. This has been known to cause a large number of fatalities in those afflicted with the disorder. Episodes that attack the gastrointestinal tract can cause a number of complications including dehydration from being unable to keep anything down (which, depending on length of the episode, can prove fatal). Symptoms from GI tract swelling including violent vomiting, intense pain from the midsection, dehydration, and intense exhaustion. Some suffered of HAE suffer from 'wandering' attacks. These attacks will center around an extremity. For example: Should the sufferer's hand swell up, it will go through the normal swelling cycle before 'transferring' to either the connection limb (In this case wrist to forearm) or move to the opposite hand. Sufferers with this symptom may find their episodes last longer and may find their triggers more difficult to track.  Pathogenesis  Because HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, there is no sex difference in transmission and both sexes are equally likely to receive the mutated gene from their parents. In an example, a father (individual A) with a mutated gene for HAE, has the disease while his wife (individual B) with 2 non-mutated copies of the C1 inhibitor gene and does not have the disease. The possibility of a cross between them gives the possibilities as shown: two of their offspring will have the disease (HEA) while the others would not.Ferraro, M. F.; Moreno, A. S.; Castelli, E. C.; Donadi, E. A.; Palma, M. S.; Arcuri, H. A.; Lange, A. P.; Bork, K.; Sarti, W.; Arruda, L. K. Allergy. Oct2011, Vol. 66 Issue 10, p1384-1390. 7p. 2 Diagrams, 1 Chart. DOI: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2011.02658.x.Bafunno, Valeria; Bova, Maria; Loffredo, Stefania; Divella, Chiara; Petraroli, Angelica; Marone, Gianni; Montinaro, Vincenzo; Margaglione, Maurizio; Triggiani, Massimo. Annals of Human Genetics. March 2014, Vol. 78 Issue 2, p73-82. 10p. DOI: 10.1111/ahg.12052. The affected father who has HAE has a mutation on one of his genes (C1-INH). Each one of his children, regardless of sex, will have a 50% chance to inherit the mutated C1-INH gene from him. HAE is generally referred to as a \\"dominant\\" condition because it only takes a mutation in one of the two C1-INH genes in a carrier to cause the disease.[Genetic test indications and interpretations in patients with hereditary angioedema. Weiler CR, van Dellen RG. Mayo Clin Proc. 2006 Jul;81(7):958-72. Review.] The prevalence of HAE is relatively low ‚Äì between 1 in every 10,000 to 1 in every 50,000 persons. Most persons with HAE acquire a C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) mutation from one of their parents. A parent with HAE usually has a 50% probability of transmitting this condition on to one of his/her children of either sex as shown in the figure (HEA Inheritance). People with no previous history of can acquire HAE by spontaneous changes in the sperm or egg cell. In a review of patients who do not have a history of HAE in their family, but who have relatively low levels of mutated C1-INH with persistent angioedema, 25% of new patients who had HAE had C1-INH changes that do not show signs of inheritance. Diagnosis Recognizing HAE is often difficult due to the wide variability in disease expression. The course of the disease is diverse and unpredictable, even within a single patient over their lifetime. This disease may be similar in its presentation to other forms of angioedema resulting from allergies or other medical conditions, but it is significantly different in cause and treatment. When HAE is misdiagnosed as an allergy it is most commonly treated with steroids and epinephrine, drugs that are usually ineffective in treating a HAE episode. Other misdiagnoses have resulted in unnecessary exploratory surgery for patients with abdominal swelling and other HAE patients report that their abdominal pain was wrongly diagnosed as psychosomatic. HAE accounts for only a small fraction of all cases of angioedema. To avoid potentially fatal consequences such as upper airway obstruction and unnecessary abdominal surgery, the importance of a correct diagnosis cannot be over-emphasized. HAE should be considered if a patient presents with: * Recurrent angioedema (without urticaria) * Recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and vomiting * Laryngeal edema * Positive family history of angioedema A blood test, ideally taken during an episode, can be used to diagnose the condition. Measure: serum complement factor 4 (C4), C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) antigenic protein, C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) functional level if available. Analysis of complement C1 inhibitor levels may play a role in diagnosis. C4 and C2 are complementary components. =Types= There are three types of C1 inhibitor deficiency: HAE type I is primarily caused by a deficiency in blood proteins (C1 esterase inhibitors) which normally suppress activation of the complement system. The resultant over-stimulation of this system leads to the production of inflammatory anaphylatoxins, which affects the flow of body fluids between the vascular system and body tissues. This deficiency is responsible for approximately 80‚Äì85% of cases. HAE type II is a less frequently encountered form of this disorder and accounts for 15‚Äì20% of cases. In this type, atypical C1-inhibitor proteins are produced which are less capable of suppressing activation of the complement system. Like HAE type I, this results in over- stimulation of this system. HAE type III is rare and has only been documented recently. Unlike types I and II, this form does not appear to be connected with C1-inhibitor deficiency. This type mainly affects females and appears to be influenced by contact with estrogens and also by hormone replacement therapy (e.g. oral contraceptives). Its pathogenesis is credited to increased activity of the enzyme kininogenase, which leads to rise in the levels of bradykinin. Other patients with type III HAE have alterations in gene F12, which encodes a protein which participates in blood coagulation. Some patients with type III HAE have a mutation in the F12 gene which produces a protein involved in blood clotting.[Type III hereditary angioedema: defined, but not understood. Kaplan A. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2012 Sep;109(3):153-4. doi: 10.1016/j.anai.2012.07.007. No abstract available.] Due to the results of a genetic test on 4 affected German families, it is believed that this type of the condition is caused by a disease-causing gene in chromosome 5q.35.2-q35.3. Prevention Treatment with ACE inhibitors is contraindicated in this condition, as these drugs can lead to bradykinin accumulation, which can precipitate disease episodes. =Long-term= People in whom episodes occur at least once a month or who are at high risk of developing laryngeal edema require long-term prevention. There are several phase III clinical trials addressing HAE prophylaxis and therapy. These have led to the licensing of pdC1INH in many parts of the world; bradykinin receptor antagonists (icatibant) in Europe; kallikrein inhibitors (ecallantide and lanadelumab) in the United States; and recombinant C1-INH replacement therapy (rhC1INH; conestat alfa) in Europe. Tranexamic acid has been shown to be relatively ineffective therapy. Danazol prophylaxis remains an option but therapeutic agents are now being used more for prophylaxis because of danazol's adverse events.Hereditary angioedema: beyond international consensus - circa December 2010 - The Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Dr. David McCourtie Lecture For people requiring long-term prophylaxis, home therapy which allows people to self-administer the product, is considered an integral part of allowing patients a normal quality of life. In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved lanadelumab, an injectable monoclonal antibody, to prevent attacks of HAE types I and II in patients over age 12. Lanadelumab inhibits the plasma enzyme kallikrein, which liberates the kinins bradykinin and kallidin from their kininogen precursors and is produced in excess in individuals with HAE types I and II.https://www.drugs.com/newdrugs/fda- approves-takhzyro-lanadelumab-flyo-hereditary- angioedema-4809.htmlhttps://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/901177?nlid=124645_3901&src;=wnl_newsalrt_180824_MSCPEDIT&uac;=23521PV&impID;=1721425&faf;=1 =Short-term= Short-term prevention is normally administered before surgery or dental treatment. In Germany, C1-INH concentrate is used for this and given 1‚Äì1.5 hours before the procedure. In countries where C1-inhibitor concentrate is not available or only available in an emergency (laryngeal edema), high- dose androgen treatment is administered for 5‚Äì7 days. Management The aim of acute treatment is to halt progression of the edema as quickly as possible, which can be life-saving, particularly if the swelling is in the larynx. In Germany, most acute treatment consists of C1 inhibitor concentrate from donor blood, which must be administered intravenously; however, in most European countries, C1 inhibitor concentrate is only available to patients who are participating in special programs. In emergency situations where C1 inhibitor concentrate is not available, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) can be used as an alternative, as it also contains C1 inhibitor. Other treatment modalities can stimulate the synthesis of C1 inhibitor, or reduce C1 inhibitor consumption. Purified C1 inhibitor, derived from human blood, has been used in Europe since 1979. Several C1 inhibitor treatments are now available in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and two C1 inhibitor products are now available in Canada. Berinert P (CSL Behring), which is pasteurized, was approved by the F.D.A. in 2009 for acute attacks. Cinryze (ViroPharma), which is nanofiltered, was approved by the F.D.A. in 2008 for prophylaxis. Ruconest (Pharming) is a recombinant C1 inhibitor approved in the US and Europe that does not carry the risk of infectious disease transmission due to human blood-borne pathogens.Morgan The medication ecallantide inhibits plasma kallikrein and was approved by the F.D.A. (but not in Europe) for acute attacks in 2009. Icatibant inhibits the bradykinin B2 receptor, and was approved in Europe and the USA.Firazyr [package insert]. Lexington, MA: Shire Orphan Therapies, Inc; 2011. In HAE, specific stimuli that have previously led to attacks may need to be avoided in the future. It does not respond to antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine.  Prognosis  About 25% of those affected die in the first two decades of life, mainly due to lack of treatment. Epidemiology Data regarding the epidemiology of angioedema is limited. The incidence of HAE is one in 10,000‚Äì50,000 people in the United States and Canada. Mortality rates are estimated at 15‚Äì33%, resulting primarily from laryngeal edema and asphyxiation. HAE leads to 15,000‚Äì30,000 emergency department visits per year.From the: Pinnacle Health System, Harrisburg Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, 111 South Front Street, Harrisburg, PA 17101, Update on treatment for her\\"Update on treatment of hereditary angioedema\\" Buyantseva, Larisa, Sardana, Niti and Craig, Timothy Society and culture There are national associations for HAE patients and their families in a number of countries around the world. These national associations are members of the global organization HAEi - International Patient Organization for C1-Inhibitor Deficiencies. HAEi is dedicated to raising awareness of C1 inhibitor deficiencies around the world. It is a non-profit international network established to promote co-operation, co-ordination and information sharing between HAE specialists and national HAE patient associations in order to help facilitate the availability of effective diagnosis and management of C1 inhibitor deficiencies throughout the world. The Assistance Fund Inc. is an American nonprofit organization that offers co-pay assistance for medications that treat HAE and is open to any American Citizens or landed immigrants who have insurance. Research Clinical development of several new active substances, which intervene in the disease process in different ways, is currently ongoing. Pharming Group NV announced on 24 June 2010 that the European Medicines Agency has adopted a positive opinion on conestat alfa (trade name Ruconest), a C1-inhibitor for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks.Pharming: Pharming Receives Positive Opinion From European Medicines Agency On Rhucin Product name in Europe changed to Ruconest Ecallantide, a peptide inhibitor of kallikrein, has received orphan status for HAE and has shown positive results in phase III trials. Icatibant (marketed as Firazyr) is a selective bradykinin receptor antagonist, which has been approved in Europe and was approved in the US by the FDA in Aug 2011. After initial borderline results this drug was shown to be effective in phase III trials.

She is famous for her plea of love and help to Attila the Hun, which led to his proclamation of his claim to rule the Western Roman Empire. Coins attest that she was granted the title of Augusta not long after the accession of her brother in 426.Stewart Oost, Galla Placidia Augusta, p. 193 Family Honoria was the only daughter of later Emperor Constantius III and Galla Placidia. Her first two names were after her maternal aunts, Justa and Grata, the daughters of Valentinian I and Justina, and the third for the emperor who reigned at the time of her birth, her half-uncle Honorius.Stewart Oost, Galla Placidia Augusta, pp. 161f She had an older, maternal half-brother by the first marriage of Placidia to king Ataulf of the Visigoths, Theodosius, who was born in 414 but died early in the following year... Her younger brother, Valentinian III, was her full brother.Olympiodorus, fragment 34. Translated by C.D. Gordon, Age of Attila: Fifth Century Byzantium and the Barbarians (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), p. 43 Biography The historical record of most of her life is little more than brief mentions of or allusions to her presence. Oost notes that she accompanied her mother and younger brother as they set sail for Constantinople in Spring of 423, and that Honoria was with them when they joined the expeditionary force at Thessalonica in the Summer of 424 that would restore Galla Placidia and Valentinian to power in the West.Stewart Oost, Galla Placidia Augusta, pp. 177, 183 She was included in mosaics of the Imperial family, now lost, at Santa Croce in Gerusalemme and in a church dedicated to Saint John the Evangelist in Ravenna.Stewart Oost, Galla Placidia Augusta, pp. 270, 273 Last is Carmen I of Merobaudes written circa 443, although a fragmentary poem it clearly includes her in a description of the family of Valentinian III.Frank M. Clover, \\"Flavius Merobaudes: A Translation and Historical Commentary\\", Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series, 61, No. 1 (1971), p. 19 These details have led Stewart Oost to observe that Honoria came to feel \\"that life had condemned her to a dull and impotent backwater.\\"Stewart Oost, Galla Placidia Augusta, pp. 246f Honoria gained a reputation with older historians of being ambitious and promiscuous, using her sexuality to advance her interests. She regarded her brother as weak and indolent, based on the events of a brief period in her life. According to John of Antioch (writing in the 7th century), she seduced her chamberlain, Eugenius, but their affair was discovered.John of Antioch, fragment 199.2; translated by C.D. Gordon, Age of Attila, p. 104 According to the Chronicle of Marcellinus Comes, Honoria was sent to a convent in Constantinople; J. B. Bury has argued that her relegation to Constantinople never happened, pointing out that Marcellinus matched the indiction of the event to the wrong pair of consuls, putting this event 15 years too early.Bury, \\"Justa Grata Honoria,\\" Journal of Roman Studies, 9 (1919), pp. 10, 13 JSTOR Whether one agrees with Bury or not, it is certain that her brother decided to marry Honoria to a Roman senator named Bassus Herculanus who was considered \\"safe\\" and unlikely to use this connection to seize the throne. Faced with this unwanted marriage, Honoria sought the aid of Attila the Hun. She sent the Hunnish king a plea for help ‚Äì and her ring ‚Äì in the spring of 450. Though Honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage, Bury points out Attila chose to interpret her message as such.Bury, \\"Justa Grata Honoria,\\" pp. 11f He accepted, asking for half of the western Empire as dowry. When Valentinian discovered the plan, again only the influence of his mother Galla Placidia convinced him to exile, rather than kill, Honoria. He also wrote to Attila strenuously denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal.Stewart Oost, Galla Placidia Augusta, p. 284 For years Attila had been planning to invade Rome and Honoria's letter gave him the excuse to make his move. Attila sent an emissary to Ravenna in 451 to proclaim that Honoria was innocent, that the proposal had been legitimate, and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his. Attila made a similar demand in 452, which was followed by his failed invasion of northern Italy. Nothing of her life after her intrigue with Attila is recorded. One assumes that she was married to Herculanus, but in concluding his account of this incident, John of Antioch writes, \\"And so Honoria was freed from her danger at this time.\\" Pointing at the last three words of this sentence, Bury asks, \\"Does this imply that she incurred some punishment afterwards, worse even than a dull marriage?\\"Bury, \\"Justa Grata Honoria,\\" p. 12 Lastly, because her name does not appear in the list of important persons carried off to Carthage by the Vandals following their sack of the city, the capture of her sister-in-law and her nieces and the murder of her brother in 455, Oost suggests she was dead by then; whether of natural causes or by order of her brother the Emperor, Oost admits \\"we do not have evidence adequate\\" to decide.Stewart Oost, Galla Placidia Augusta, p. 285 Portrayals * She was portrayed by Sophia Loren in the 1954 film Attila. * She was portrayed by Kirsty Mitchell in the 2001 miniseries Attila. * She was portrayed by Ivelina Ivanova in the 2016 docudrama Barbarians Rising.

It differed from the better-known high treason in that high treason can only be committed against the Sovereign. In England and Wales, petty treason ceased to be a distinct offence from murder by virtue of the Offences against the Person Act 1828.Section 1 (repealing the previous statute) and section 2 (assimilating the offence to murder). It was abolished in Ireland in 1829.9 Geo.4 c. 31, sections 1 and 3. It never existed in Scotland. It has also been abolished in other common-law countries. Element of betrayal The element of betrayal is the reason why this crime was considered worse than an ordinary murder; medieval and post-medieval society rested on a framework in which each person had his or her appointed place and such murders were seen as threatening this framework. Many people had somebody subordinate to them and feared the consequences if the murder of superiors was not punished harshly. Codification in English law The common law offence was codified in the Treason Act 1351. Under that Act, petty treason was an aggravated form of murder. It consisted of: # a wife killing her husband, # a clergyman killing his prelate # a servant killing his master or mistress, or his master's wife.Hale p. 380 The Act abolished three other forms of petty treason which had existed under common law: # a wife attempting to kill her husband, # a servant forging his master's seal, or # a servant committing adultery with his master's wife or daughter. Counterfeiting gold or silver coin was also petty treason before the 1351 Act elevated this to high treason.Commentaries on the Laws of England, William Blackstone, Book 4 chapter 6 However the method of execution was not changed. Penalty The punishment for a man convicted of petty treason was to be drawn to the place of execution and hanged, but not quartered as in the case of high treason. The punishment for a woman was to be burned at the stake without being drawn there (the penalty for high treason was drawing and burning). In later years the law offered a modicum of mercy to women who were to be executed in this fashion: the executioner was equipped with a cord passed around the victim's throat and, standing outside of the fire, would pull it tight, strangling her before the flames could reach her. In a few instances, however, this could go wrong, with the cord burning through and the victim burning alive; the ensuing scandals contributed to the abolition of this punishment and its replacement by hanging in 1790.Treason Act 1790 Defences and rules of procedure The common law defence of provocation, by which a verdict of murder could be reduced to manslaughter, was also available in petty treason trials. The rules of evidence and procedure in petty treason trials were the same as in high treason trials, except that the Treason Act 1695 did not apply to petty treason.Commentaries on the Laws of England, William Blackstone, Book 4 chapter 14 Petty treason also differed from high treason in that the legal defence of benefit of clergy was available for petty treason until 1496,Benefit of Clergy Act 1496 (12 Hen. 7 c. 7) whereas it was never available for high treason.

Common uses include during childbirth, following trauma, and as part of end-of-life care. Onset of effect is typically within half a minute and lasts for about a minute. There are few side effects, other than vomiting, with short-term use. With long-term use anemia or numbness may occur. It should always be given with at least 21% oxygen. It is not recommended in people with a bowel obstruction or pneumothorax. Use in the early part of pregnancy is not recommended. Breastfeeding can occur following use. Nitrous oxide was discovered between 1772 and 1793 and used for anesthesia in 1844. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It often comes as a 50/50 mixture with oxygen. Devices with a demand valve are available for self-administration. The setup and maintenance is relatively expensive for developing countries. Medical uses Nitrous oxide (N2O) is itself active (does not require any changes in the body to become active), and so has an onset in roughly the lung‚Äìbrain circulation time. This gives it a peak action 30 seconds after the start of administration; Entonox should thus be used accordingly, i.e. inhalation should start 30 seconds before a contraction becomes painful in labour. It is removed from the body unchanged via the lungs, and does not accumulate under normal conditions, explaining the rapid offset of around 60 seconds. It is effective in managing pain during labor and delivery. Nitrous oxide is more soluble than oxygen and nitrogen, so will tend to diffuse into any air spaces within the body. This makes it dangerous to use in patients with pneumothorax or those who have recently been scuba diving, and there are cautions over its use with any bowel obstruction. Its analgesic effect is strong (equivalent to 15 mg of subcutaneous route morphine) and characterised by rapid onset and offset, i.e. it is very fast- acting and wears off very quickly. Contraindications N2O should not be used in patients with bowel obstruction, pneumothorax, middle ear or sinus disease, and should also not be used on any patient who has been scuba diving within the preceding 24 hours or in violently disturbed psychiatric patients. There are also clinical cautions in place for the first two trimesters of pregnancy and in patients with decreased levels of consciousness. Composition The gas is a mixture of half nitrous oxide (N2O or laughing gas) and half oxygen (O2). The ability to combine N2O (nitrous oxide is the common name; dinitrogen monoxide, systematic name) and oxygen at high pressure while remaining in the gaseous form is caused by the Poynting effect (after John Henry Poynting, an English physicist). The Poynting effect involves the dissolution of gaseous O2 when bubbled through liquid N2O, with vaporisation of the liquid to form a gaseous O2/N2O mixture. Inhalation of pure N2O over a continued period would deprive the patient of oxygen, but the 50% oxygen content prevents this from occurring. The two gases will separate at low temperatures (<4 ¬∞C), which would permit administration of hypoxic mixtures. Therefore, it is not given from a cold cylinder without being shaken (usually by cylinder inversion) to remix the gases. File:Entonox Shoulder.pngDistinct blue and white cap of an Entonox cylinder File:Entonox schrader valve.pngTypical Schrader valve attachment, making the gas usable only with demand based giving sets Administration The gas is self-administered through a demand valve, using a mouthpiece, bite block or face mask. Self- administration of Entonox is safe because if enough is inhaled to start to induce anaesthesia, the patient becomes unable to hold the valve, and so will drop it and soon exhale the residual gas. This means that unlike other anaesthetic gases, it does not require the presence of an anaesthetist for administration. The 50% oxygen in Entonox ensures the person will have a sufficient oxygen in their alveoli and conducting airways for a short period of apnea to be safe. History Administration of nitrous oxide, 1870 Pure N2O was first used as a medical analgesic in December 1844, when Horace Wells made the first 12‚Äì15 dental operations with the gas in Hartford. Its debut as a generally accepted method, however, came in 1863, when Gardner Quincy Colton introduced it more broadly at all the Colton Dental Association clinics, that he founded in New Haven and New York City. The first devices used in dentistry to administer the gas consisted of a simple breathing bag made of rubber cloth. Breathing the pure gas often caused hypoxia (oxygen insufficiency) and sometimes death by asphyxiation. Eventually practitioners became aware of the need to provide at least 21% oxygen content in the gas (the same percentage as in air). In 1911, the anaesthetist Arthur Ernest Guedel first described the use of self-administration of a nitrous oxide and oxygen mix. It was not until 1961 that the first paper was published by Michael Tunstall and others, describing the administration of a pre-mixed 50:50 nitrous oxide and oxygen mix, which led to the commercialisation of the product. In 1970, Peter Baskett recognised that pre-mixed nitrous oxide and oxygen mix could have an important part to play in the provision of pre-hospital pain relief management, provided by ambulance personnel. Baskett contacted the Chief Ambulance Officer for the Gloucestershire Ambulance Brigade, Alan Withnell, to suggest this idea. This gained traction when Baskett negotiated with the British Oxygen Company, the availability of pre-mixed nitrous oxide and oxygen mix apparatus for training. Regular training sessions began at Frenchay Hospital (Bristol) and a pilot study was run in Gloucestershire (in which ambulances were crewed by a driver and one of the new highly trained ambulance men), the results of this trial were published in 1970.Baskett PJ, Withnell A 'Use of Entonox in the ambulance service' British Medical Journal 1970 2(41) 41 - 43 Today the nitrous oxide is administered in hospitals by a relative analgesia machine, which includes several improvements such as flowmeters and constant-flow regulators, an anaesthetic vaporiser, a medical ventilator, and a scavenger system, and delivers a precisely dosed and breath-actuated flow of nitrous oxide mixed with oxygen. The machine used in dentistry is much simpler, and is meant to be used by the patient in a fully conscious state. The gas is delivered through a demand-valve inhaler over the nose, which will only release gas when the patient inhales through it. Society and culture Nitronox was a registered trademark of BOC between 1966 and 1999, and was reregistered by Hs Tm Inc since 2005 It is also colloquially known as \\"gas and air\\". Research Investigational trials show potential for antidepressant applications of N2O, especially for treatment-resistant forms of depression, and it is rapid- acting.

In Sk√°ldskaparm√°l he is given as a Sikling and a relative of Sigar who killed the hero Hagbard. Hversu Noregr bygg√∞ist specifies that the last Sigar was Siggeir's nephew. According to the V√∂lsunga saga, Siggeir married Signy, the sister of Sigmund and the daughter of king V√∂lsung. At the banquet Odin appears in disguise wearing a cape and a hood and sticks a sword in the tree Branstock. Then he said that whoever managed to pull the sword out could keep it. Siggeir and everyone else tried but only Sigmund succeeded. Siggeir generously offered three times the sword's value, but Sigmund mockingly refused. Siggeir was offended and went home the next day thinking of revenge. Siggeir invites Sigmund, his father V√∂lsung and Sigmund's nine brothers to a visit in Gautland to see the newlyweds three months later. When the V√∂lsung clan had arrived they were attacked by the Gauts (Geats) and king V√∂lsung was killed and his sons captured. Signy beseeched her husband to spare her brothers and to put them in stocks instead of killing them. As Siggeir thought that the brothers deserved to be tortured before they were killed, he agreed. He then let his shape-shifting mother turn into a wolf and each night devour one of the brothers, until only Sigmund remained. Signy had a servant smear honey on the face of Sigmund and when the she-wolf arrived she started licking the honey off Sigmund's face. As she licked, she stuck her tongue into Sigmund's mouth, whereupon Sigmund bit her tongue off, killing her. Sigmund then hid in the forests of Gautland and Signy brought him everything he needed. Signy gave Siggeir two sons and when the oldest one was ten years old, she sent him to Sigmund to train him to avenge the V√∂lsungs. The boy did not stand a test of courage so Signy asked Sigmund to kill her worthless son. The same thing happened to Siggeir's second son. Signy came to Sigmund in the guise of a witch and she and her brother committed incest and had the son Sinfjotli. After some adventures Sigmund and Sinfjotli killed Siggeir.

The twin tunnels form a two-lane dual carriageway connecting Dublin Port, which lies to the east of central Dublin, and the M50 motorway at junction 2, close to Dublin Airport. The tunnels are in length and total project length of . It had final cost of approximately ‚Ç¨752 million. The tunnel was officially opened on 20 December 2006; it was initially only open to HGVs.Port Tunnel to open on 20 December, RT√â News Port tunnel opens after last-minute delay, RT√â News It was opened to all traffic on 28 January 2007.Port Tunnel opens to all users, RT√â News Purpose Traffic congestion in central Dublin became severe at the end of the 20th century, with thousands of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) travelling to and from Dublin port via the city centre. The tunnel relieves surface road congestion in Dublin city centre by diverting HGVs from Dublin Port directly onto the motorway network. This has positive knock-on effects for bus users, pedestrians and cyclists travelling along the city quays, including better air quality and safer travel. To discourage commuters from using the tunnel, vehicles other than HGVs are heavily tolled at peak times. HGVs travelling north and west benefit from the expected six-minute journey time through the tunnel. A tunnel was chosen as it was decided that a surface relief road was not feasible. Dublin Bus routes 142, 33x and 41x use the tunnel to get to the port area of the city from the northern suburbs. Longer distance buses from Belfast, Derry and Letterkenny also use the route. Port tunnel project The tunnel was first suggested in the 1990s after a number of transportation and engineering studies and was included in the Dublin City Development Plan 1999 ‚Äì 2005\\\\. The project was approved following a public inquiry in 1999. The tunnel formed part of the National Development Plan and funds were provided under the plan to the National Roads Authority by the Department of Transport. The contract was managed by Dublin City Council and supervised by Brown & Root, a unit of Halliburton. The main contractor was a Japanese-British-Irish consortium Nishimatsu Mowlem IrishencoFollowing bankruptcy, the name and assets of this eponymous and long-standing Irish company were bought by Mowlem before construction of the tunnel began. Thereafter, Irishenco was possibly best described as an Irish-based branch of Mowlem, which was itself dissolved in 2006. (NMI), appointed in 2000. The tender price for construction of the tunnel was ‚Ç¨457 million. The final project cost was brought to ‚Ç¨752 million by land acquisition, design, insurance, legal and other services, plus supervision by Brown & Root. Construction commenced in June 2001 and the tunnel was originally due to open in 2005 after an elapsed time of 43 months. It eventually opened in December 2006, giving an elapsed time of 66 months. One reason for the project extension was to allay residents' noise concerns. Under some areas such as Griffith Avenue and the Cloisters, boring was restricted to 16 hours per day. Under Annadale Crescent it was reduced to 13 hours.

Tunnel design The tunnel was built in five sections including a pipe-jacked section under the Dublin-Belfast railway line. =Cut and cover= The \\"cut and cover\\" sections at both ends featured excavations as deep as 12 m into which horseshoe-shaped sections of reinforced concrete were cast in-situ and backfilled. The southern section, at Fairview, is 500 m long while the northern cut and cover channel from Whitehall Church to Shantalla extends over 1500 m. This work was undertaken by the Mowlem and Irishenco units of the consortium. =Tunnel boring= Both bored sections were initiated from a shaft 33 m deep and 57 m in diameter created at Collins Avenue by Mowlem in a joint venture with Intrafor of France. From here, the Tunnel boring machines (TBM), managed by Nishimatsu, were sent north through open clay and south through hard limestone. As is traditional, both machines were named after women ‚Äì Meghan for 650 m of open clay and Grainne for 2,600 m of limestone. TBM-1 \\"Grainne\\" headed south, passing under Griffith Avenue, Marino and Fairview. It was then dismantled, turned around and used to bore a second tunnel for the southbound carriageway. The machine, designed by Herrenknecht of Germany, was 156 m long, 12 m in diameter and was delivered to Dublin port in 105 parts carried by three ships, taking one week to unload. Combined, these bores resulted in the removal of 500,000 m¬≥ of rock. A similar process was followed northwards by the 60 m long TBM-2 \\"Meghan\\" boring from Collins Avenue to Whitehall Church, first creating the southbound carriageway. The bores were completed with breakthrough into the reception shaft on 18 November 2003 and 18 August 2004 for clay and rock, respectively. Much of the bored sections are 21‚Äì23 m below the surface, with the lowest point at Marino, towards the southern end, a point that also hosts the tunnel's drainage sump. =Pipe jacking= A particular challenge was faced near the southern portals where the tunnel passes under the Dublin to Belfast railway, a line that also carries suburban and commuter services. The railway was constructed on an elevated embankment made up of soft materials resting on alluvial deposits of sand and silt. Because the railway had to remain operational at all times, the cut and cover approach could not be used. Nishimatsu constructed a pipe-jacked supporting structure for the railway 3.5 m below the surface. The tunnel was then constructed in the supported space using horse-shoe sections and backfilled. This 60 m section took 24 months to complete and resulted in the adjoining Alfie Byrne road being raised by 1.5 m. It also resulted in one incident of subsidence that closed the railway for three hours. This closure cost the contractor ‚Ç¨300,000 in penalties ‚Äì ‚Ç¨28 per second. =Other works= A new entrance and exit for the Dublin port was constructed including a new bridge over the Tolka river that connects to the toll plaza and southern portals. A new junction and underpass facilitates traffic from the East Wall Road towards the tunnel. Citybound traffic approaching the tunnel on the M50 (formerly the M1 at this point) can utilise two tunnel-bound lanes or two surface lanes that continue as the N1 toward Whitehall. Traffic emerging at the southern portal approaches the toll plaza outside the port. Tunnel operation Following a tender process in 2005, the NRA selected Transroute International, part of France's Groupe Egis, to operate the tunnel for a period of five years with an optional renewal of two years. The service contract provided for operation, maintenance, safety, traffic management and toll collection. A new subsidiary, Transroute Tunnel Operations Ireland Ltd, was set up for the purpose. Tunnel operations, including tolling, employ between 50 and 60 people. The service contract was worth ‚Ç¨15 million to Transroute over the five-year period. The tunnel is currently operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland. Elsewhere, Egis was also selected to provide a central system to enable interoperability between different electronic toll collection systems in Ireland. Tolling The tunnel is tolled, with funds collected remitted to the Department of Transport. To facilitate the ban on 5-axled HGVs in Greater Dublin, there are no tolls for vehicles in excess of 3,500 kg MLW, or for vehicles capable of carrying 25 passengers or more. The original tolling scheme saw three stages of tolling:AA Roadwatch ‚Äì http://www.aaroadwatch.ie/news/story.asp?ID=1332 ‚Äì accessed 15 February 2009 22:27UTC *06:00‚Äì10:00 (Southbound) and 16:00‚Äì19:00 (Northbound) ‚Äì ‚Ç¨12 *10:00‚Äì22:00 (Southbound) and 06:00‚Äì16:00 - 19:00-22:00(Northbound) ‚Äì ‚Ç¨6 *22:00‚Äì06:00, and all day Saturday and Sunday, in both directions ‚Äì ‚Ç¨3 To alleviate congestion and due to extra capacity, these tolls have now been revised.

To date, tolls have been payable either on an ad-hoc basis by cash, credit or debit card or electronically by using a tolling tag from a provider such as eFlow. Cash payments are made either to a cashier, or by dropping coins only (5c denomination and above only) into an automatic counter in certain lanes. BGA Fleming award The project was joint winner in December 2003 of the British Geotechnical Association's international Fleming award for excellence in geotechnical design and construction. The award was for the innovative 'observational approach' used in optimising the design of the tunnel launch shaft in Whitehall, and for the soil-nailed open-cut section of the works accommodating the northern cut and cover tunnel. The award was shared with the recovery operation project for the World Trade Center, following the 2001 attack. Safety features There are 15 pedestrian crossing points (PCPs) situated 250 m apart with emergency telephone and fire fighting niches. Additional fire hose reels are located 125 m from each niche. There are four vehicle crossover points at 1 km intervals comprising a lay-by plus emergency and recovery area. These are located under Shantalla, Collins Avenue (site of the original launch shaft), Marino and Cloisters. GSM telephone and FM radio coverage is carried into the tunnel with break-in facilities over public broadcasts in the event of an emergency. There are 420 cameras attached to the vehicle management system (VMS). A maximum speed limit of 80 km/h (50 mph) is in place and HGVs are prevented from using the outside lane. Overheight vehicles are detected up to 3 km from the tunnel portals and automatic signage is then deployed to stop the vehicle. If necessary, barriers can be lowered to protect the portals. Controversies =Safety lapses= RT√â's Prime Time ran two reports (28 February and 4 March 2008) alleging that tunnel operator Transroute and the National Roads Authority were keeping the tunnel open in situations contrary to the tunnel safety manual. These included: *SCADA computer system failures *Failure of the tunnel's jet fans used for fire fighting (up to fifteen in one incident) *Blockage of vehicle crossover points with water containers The programme claimed that the tunnel safety manual had been re-written to allow the tunnel to remain open despite safety failures that would previously have required \\"immediate closure\\". =House damage= During the hard-rock boring works vibration caused some damage. Houses in the Marino area were surveyed before and after tunnelling and necessary repairs reimbursed. There were 241 claims and these were adjudicated by a loss adjuster. A fund of ‚Ç¨1.5 million was set aside. =City centre ban= Dublin City Council's policy was to introduce a ban on trucks in the city centre between 7am and 7pm, but it agreed to delay this ban for a period of two months until 19 February 2007. This was because of opposition from the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC), the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Dublin Port Company. The hauliers cited unreasonable traffic congestion on the M50, especially during the imminent widening of the northern section while IBEC and the Port Company were concerned about restrictions on free movement of goods. The Sunday Independent ran a story on 12 November 2006 revealing the ban came into force soon after as the Tunnel opened. The then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern reportedly put pressure on the Council to abandon their phased approach and initiate the ban in one go. The plan was criticised by opposition parties who said such a move would simply dump the problem onto an already \\"dangerously crowded M50\\". The M50 ring road around Dublin has since been widened to 4 lanes (3 running lanes and 1 interconnecting lane between exits) in each direction and all of the interchanges are free-flow or partially free-flow since the end of 2010. This in effect negates the concerns regarding capacity. =East Link tolls= One company located south of the Liffey, Marine Terminals Ltd, considered taking legal action against the Council if it went ahead with banning trucks from the city. This was because a ban would force the company to use the tunnel, which would mean crossing the privately owned and operated East-link toll bridge, incurring a ‚Ç¨4.80 charge each way. In response, the council agreed with National Toll Roads (NTR), the operator of the bridge at the time, to lift the toll for trucks. =Height controversy= Even before the commencement of construction, the tunnel was criticised for not being high enough. Critics argued that it would not be able to accommodate heavy goods vehicles higher than 4.65 m (15 ft) and that it should be built with an operating height of 5.5 m to accommodate virtually all sizes of trucks. Proponents of the chosen design argued that it made best economic sense and that it would be able to accommodate most heavy vehicles with only a minor percentage having to use the surface road network. Construction went ahead as planned, but speaking at the breakthrough ceremony, Jimmy Quinn of the Irish Road Haulage Association stated that a future generation may look back and say (about the tunnel not being high enough for very high trucks): \\"Maybe they should have done it when they were building it.\\" In its submission to the public inquiry, the Irish Road Haulage Association did not raise the issue of the operating height of the Port Tunnel. Among the 44 countries of the International Transport Forum (covering Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals), the 4.65m operating height of the Dublin Port Tunnel is the highest specified height. Thirty six countries have an operating height of 4m. Three countries (Finland, Iceland, FYRMacedonia) have an operating height not greater than 4.4m. Four countries (France, Norway, Sweden, UK) have not defined a height.

When the concrete was removed during remedial works, protective membranes were punctured, resulting in leaks. Once the membranes and concrete were re-instated, the leaks ceased. =Cost overruns= While it is often claimed that the project went over-budget, this is not actually the case. The tender price at ‚Ç¨457 million was for construction only while the total project cost was approximately ‚Ç¨752 million. In September 2005, it was reported that NMI was launching a claim for an additional ‚Ç¨300 million.Dublin Port Tunnel to top 1 billion euro ‚Äì sustainabledevelopments.ie The Council has stated that this claim will not be met and that the total project cost remains at ‚Ç¨752 million. =Relocation of Dublin Port= In October 2006, as the tunnel neared completion, the Progressive Democrats held a conference on their proposalA New Heart for Dublin , one-day conference, Dublin, 2006 to relocate Dublin Port to Bremore on the outskirts of Balbriggan, and to redevelop the port area for mixed high density uses.

Today, most of them are not considered historical. This list follows the generally accepted identification between the names G√∂tar (modern Swedish), Gautar (Old Norse) and Geatas (Old English), which is based both on tradition, literary sources and on etymology. However, unlike some translations it does not identify this tribe with the Goths. Both Old Norse and Old English records clearly separate the Geats from the Goths, while still depicting them as closely related to each other. From the Middle Ages until 1974, the king of Sweden claimed the title King of the Geats as \\"King of Sweden and Geats/Goths\\" or \\"Rex Sweorum et Gothorum\\". Danish monarchs used the similar title \\"King of the Goths\\" from 1362 until 1972.

Historical kings  When sources become more reliable, G√∂taland is an integrated part of the Swedish kingdom and from Stenkil and onwards most of the medieval Swedish kings actually belonged to Geatish clans (House of Stenkil, House of Sverker and the House of Bjelbo, possibly also the House of Eric). In the early high Middle Ages some kings in Sweden were titled rex Visigothorum and rex Gothorum, failing to hold the Swedish core provinces in Svealand. The non-Geatish King Ragnvald Knaph√∂vde was killed by the Geats as he despised them and travelled among them without Geatish hostages. *Ingold I, king of V√§sterg√∂tland (1081) *Halsten, king of V√§sterg√∂tland (1081) *Magnus the Strong, king of V√§sterg√∂tland (reigned 1125-1130) *Kol, king of √ñsterg√∂tland (see Ingold II) (early 12th century) *Karl Sverkersson, rex Gothorum before becoming king of all of Sweden. * since Magnus III of Sweden until accession of Charles XVI Gustav, Sweden's monarchs were officially titled King of the Goths; and quite parallelly, since Valdemar IV's conquest of Gotland until accession of Margrethe II of Denmark, Denmark's monarchs were similarly titled.

Yvon Dumont, (born January 21, 1951) is a Manitoba politician and office- holder. In 1993, he became the first member of Manitoba's M√©tis community to be appointed as the province's 21st Lieutenant Governor. He was born in St. Laurent, Manitoba. He became involved in the Manitoba Metis Federation in 1967, and became its Director for the Interlake region in 1972. He was chosen Executive Vice-President of the Federation in 1973, and served as its President from 1984 to 1993. Dumont was also a founding member of the Native Council of Canada in 1972, and served as President of the M√©tis National Council from 1988 to 1993. He has participated as a representative of the MMF at Canadian First Ministers' conference, and has been actively involved in constitutional debates concerning First Nations and M√©tis peoples. Dumont has rejected the integration of M√©tis services into larger Indigenous institutions, expressing concern that M√©tis distinctiveness could be lost. Dumont has also been a municipal councillor in St. Laurent, and was on the Board of Governors for the University of Manitoba. He received a Manitoba Metis Federation Award in 1993, and a National Aboriginal Achievement Award, now the Indspire Awards, in 1996. Dumont's appointment as Lt. Governor of Manitoba coincided with a national reappraisal of M√©tis leader Louis Riel's role in the province's creation. Once regarded as a rebel and an outlaw, Riel has in recent years been accepted as a Father of Confederation for his role in establishing a provisional government in the Red River Colony. The appointment of Dumont as Lt. Governor undoubtedly reflected this changed perspective. The position of Lt. Governor is largely ceremonial, and Dumont had very little influence over the Progressive Conservative government of Gary Filmon. Dumont was appointed to the Order of Manitoba in 2001. He ran again for the leadership of the MMF in 2003, but was defeated by David Chartrand. Arms References * Lt.

The first legal same-sex marriages performed in Ontario were of Kevin Bourassa to Joe Varnell, and Elaine Vautour to Anne Vautour, by Rev. Brent Hawkes on January 14, 2001. signed by Rev. Brent Hawkes The legality of the marriages was questioned and they were not registered until after June 10, 2003, Certificate of marriage, issued June 11, 2003. when the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Halpern v Canada (AG) upheld a lower court ruling which declared that defining marriage in heterosexual-only terms violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Ontario became the third jurisdiction in the world (after the Netherlands and Belgium) as well as the first jurisdiction in the Americas to legalize same-sex marriage.Sylvain Larocque \\"Gay Marriage: The Story of a Canadian Social Revolution\\", published by James Lorimer & Company Ltd, 2006 The first legal same-sex marriage registered in Ontario was that of Paula Barrero and Blanca Mejias, married by banns at the Emmanuel Howard Park United Church on September 29, 2001 and registered the same year. The officiant was Rev. Dr. Cheri DiNovo (who later served as MPP for Parkdale‚ÄìHigh Park from 2006 to 2017). The Office of the Registrar General apparently did not recognize the names as both being women and issued a marriage certificate. The marriage licence form requested only the names of the bride and groom, not the sex of the applicants. All of these marriages were authorized by calling the banns in the spouses' churches. The first civil marriage license issued to a same-sex couple was to Michael Stark and Michael Leshner, who had the usual waiting period waived and completed the formalities of marriage just hours after the court ruling, on June 10, 2003. Background In 1993, the Ontario Superior Court in Layland v. Ontario ruled that same-sex couples did not have the capacity to marry each other. However, that decision was non-binding as it was the same court taking up the issue in 2002. One of the judges in the most recent case wrote \\"with respect, the decisions to which I have referred assumed, without analysis, that the inability of persons of the same sex to marry was a question of capacity. The decisions are not binding on this court and, with respect, I do not find them persuasive.\\"Text of the rulingSummary of the decision from EGALE Canada The Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act, which would have granted same-sex couples a status comparable to civil unions, was proposed by the Government of Bob Rae in 1994, but was defeated. In October 1999, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario enacted a bill providing same-sex couples with the same statutory rights and responsibilities as applied to opposite-sex common-law spouses under 67 provincial laws as required by the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling in M v H. It introduced the term \\"same-sex partner\\", while preserving the opposite-sex definition of \\"spouse\\". It also included the right for same-sex couples to adopt children jointly.III. Adoption D. Legislative Approaches in Other Jurisdictions Court of Appeal ruling On July 12, 2002, in a 3-0 decision of the Ontario Superior Court, same-sex couples won the right to marry in the case of Halpern v Canada (AG). The Court ruled that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violated the equality provisions of the Charter of Rights, giving the Government of Canada a two-year stay of judgment in which to pass legislation implementing same-sex marriage; otherwise, same-sex marriage would come into force automatically. In 2003, the couples in Halpern appealed the decision, requesting that the decision take effect immediately instead of after a delay. On June 10, 2003, the Court of Appeal for Ontario confirmed that current Canadian law on marriage violated the equality provisions in Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in being restricted to heterosexual couples. The Appeals Court struck down the stay of judgment given in the 2002 ruling, thereby causing the judgment to come into effect immediately. Although marriage is a federal law, the court only had jurisdiction to implement the ruling within Ontario. The province thus became the first jurisdiction in North America to recognize same-sex marriage, and the third in the world. Consequently, the city of Toronto announced that the city clerk would begin issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples. The next day, the Attorney General of Ontario announced that the province would comply with the ruling. The court also ruled that two couples who had previously attempted to marry using an ancient common-law procedure called \\"reading the banns\\" would be considered legally married. Provincial legislation The Ontario Human Rights Code includes sexual orientation, family status and marital status as protected characteristics against discrimination. Sexual orientation was added to the Code in 1986, 10 years before its addition to the Canadian Human Rights Act. On February 24, 2005, the Spousal Relationships Statute Law Amendment Act, 2005 () was passed in the Legislative Assembly, which performed \\"housekeeping\\" on various Ontario laws, to bring their wording into line with the court ruling. As well, the bill ensures that no religious institution or clergy will be forced to perform a ceremony against their beliefs. There is no such provision for civil officials.

Their music combines traditional Portuguese music, fado, and influences of modern folk music. The songs' lyrics are often melancholic, related to the sea, travelling or absence, continuing a tradition of songs dating back to Medieval times (with obvious connection to cantigas de amigo among others). Madredeus founding members were Pedro Ayres Magalh√£es (classical guitar), Rodrigo Le√£o (keyboard synthesizer), Francisco Ribeiro (cello), Gabriel Gomes (accordion) and Teresa Salgueiro (vocals). Magalh√£es and Le√£o formed the band in 1985, Ribeiro and Gomes joined in 1986. In search of a female singer, they found Teresa Salgueiro in one of Lisbon's night clubs. Teresa agreed to join and, in 1987, Madredeus recorded their first album, Os dias da Madredeus. The first album was recorded in their rehearsal space, a converted abbey in Lisbon. The recording was especially strenuous due to deafening interruptions every 5 minutes from Lisbon's tram service, which ran directly above. In honour of this unavoidable presence in their every performance, they named themselves after the surrounding neighborhood, Madre de Deus (Mother of God), shortened to the vernacular Madredeus. In 1993, Pedro Ayres Magalh√£es left the band temporarily and was replaced in live concerts by Jos√© Peixoto (classical guitar). Magalh√£es rejoined the group later, making it a sextet with two guitarists. They released several albums and became very popular in Portugal, but remained relatively unknown abroad. This changed in 1994 when Wim Wenders, impressed by their music, asked Madredeus to perform in his movie Lisbon Story - the soundtrack gave the band international fame. Madredeus consequently toured Europe, South America, Africa and Asia. In 1994, Rodrigo Le√£o left the band to start a solo career, being replaced by Carlos Maria Trindade (keyboard synthesizer). In 1997, Francisco Ribeiro and Gabriel Gomes left the band as Madredeus' style started abandoning its fado roots with the release of O Para√≠so. At this time Fernando J√∫dice (Acoustic bass guitar) was invited to join them. The group would, again, be a quintet. In 1998, Madredeus contributed \\"Os Dias S√£o A Noite (Suso Saiz Remix)\\" to the AIDS benefit compilation album Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon produced by the Red Hot Organization. In November 2007, Teresa Salgueiro announced she had left Madredeus. In April 2012 Madredeus announced its new album Essencia. This album is a travel through Madredeus music for 25 years since it was formed. Madredeus announced too its new formation, composed of Beatriz Nunes (singer), Pedro Ayres de Magalh√£es (guitar), Carlos Maria Trinidade (synthesizer), Jorge Varrecoso (violin), Antonio Figueirido (violin) and Luis Clode (cello). With this new formation Pedro Ayres said in an interview: \\"The melody is much more supported, without losing harmonic and rhythmic sense and keeps walking Madredeus\\". Madredeus has sold over 3 million albums worldwide. Solo careers of former members Since leaving Madredeus in 2007, Teresa Salgueiro has released several solo albums. Former member and co-founder Francisco Ribeiro released his first solo album Desiderata: A Jun√ß√£o do Bem in 2009. He died on 14 September 2010 from cancer.

It was unveiled on 3 August 2003 in a ceremony attended by 2,008 people at Beijing's Temple of Heaven. Description The emblem draws on various elements of Chinese culture, depicting a traditional red Chinese seal above the words \\"Beijing 2008\\" and the Olympic rings. The seal is inscribed with a stylised calligraphic rendition of the Chinese character ‰∫¨ (jƒ´ng, meaning 'capital', from the name of the host city) in the form of a dancing figure. The curves are also claimed to suggest the body of a wriggling Chinese dragon. The open arms of the figure symbolise the invitation of China to the world to share in its culture. The figure also resembles that of a runner crossing the finish line. Red, the dominant colour of the emblem, is an important colour in Chinese society, often signifying prosperity. Design The logo was created by Guo Chunning, the vice-president of the \\"Beijing Armstrong International Corporate Identity\\" (AICI). There was only one seal among the 1,985 entries contributed by designers from China and overseas. Other entries included dozens of Great Walls, pandas and dragons.English hanban.edu.cn Other designers include Zhang Wu (Âº†Ê≠¶).

This is a milestone in the history of your Olympic quest. As this new emblem becomes known around the world and, as it takes its place at the centre of your Games, we are confident that it will achieve the stature of one of the best and most meaningful symbols in Olympic history.\\" The ceremony was delayed by several months because of the SARS outbreak in 2003.

He played college football for the UCLA Bruins, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American. He was drafted by the Ravens 4th overall in the 1996 NFL Draft. He was an 11-time Pro Bowl selection and a nine-time All-Pro. Ogden won Super Bowl XXXV with the Ravens in 2001. On February 2, 2013, Ogden was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the first inductee to spend his entire playing career as a Raven. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2012. Early years Ogden was born in Washington, D.C. He received his education at St. Albans School in Washington, excelling not only in high school football but also in track and field. He was a high school All-American in both football and track. He had high school-best throws of 19.23 meters (63.09 feet) in the shot put and 56.73 meters (186.12 feet) in the discus throw. College career Ogden decided to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) instead of the University of Florida because the Bruins football coaches would let him participate in track and field. As a sophomore, he helped UCLA to the 1993 Pac-10 Championship and Rose Bowl. He later won the 1996 NCAA Men's Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships in the shot put, with a personal best of 19.42 meters. Ogden had an outstanding career with the Bruins football team, starting as a left tackle for four years. In 23 games during his junior and senior years, he allowed just two sacks. In 1995, Ogden received the Outland Trophy and the Morris Trophy, was the UPI Lineman of the Year, and was a unanimous All-American. Ogden's father, an investment banker, told his son to accept UCLA's decision to move him from right to left tackle.Michael Lewis, The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game, at 257 (W.W. Norton & Co., Inc. 2007). Ogden's jersey was retired by UCLA, making him only the eighth player in school history to receive that honor. He was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 2006. On December 5, 2012 he was enshrined into the College Football Hall of Fame.Ogden Officially Enters College Football Hall of Fame , UCLABruins.com, December 5, 2012 Professional career During the 1996 NFL Draft, Ogden was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round with the fourth overall choice, the first-ever draft pick made by the Ravens. Ozzie Newsome wanted to select Ogden but owner, Art Modell wanted to select Lawrence Phillips. Phillips played in 3 NFL seasons and rushed for a career yardage total of 1,453. He was named a four-time All-Pro and an 11-time Pro Bowler at left tackle, earning trips to Hawaii in every season except his rookie year. During his career, Ogden caught two passes ‚Äì both for one yard and both for touchdowns. He also recovered 10 fumbles and recorded 10 tackles. Ogden also won a reputation for smiling. \\"He's a laugher,\\" joked former New York Giants DE Michael Strahan. \\"You see him, you think to yourself this guy is not mean enough to handle the mean guys out there in the NFL. Jonathan would rip your limbs off, and he'd smile...and wave your arm in front of you.\\" Ogden also threw his helmet in frustration several times. He is widely considered one of the best tackles to ever play the game. In 2001, Ogden won a Super Bowl ring with the Ravens when they defeated the New York Giants 34‚Äì7 in Super Bowl XXXV. Ogden announced his retirement on June 12, 2008Ogden ‚Äì \\"I'm a Raven for life\\" after a career that spanned 12 seasons, all with Baltimore. His retirement left Ray Lewis and Matt Stover as the last remaining Ravens from the team's inaugural season in Baltimore. At 6' 9\\", Ogden was tied with fellow Raven Jared Gaither and Bengals tackle Dennis Roland as the tallest player in the NFL at the end of his playing career. Ogden served as the Ravens' honorary captain at Super Bowl XLVII, which saw his former team win their second world championship. Personal life Ogden married Kema Hunt in 2004. The couple resides in Las Vegas. He established the Jonathan Ogden Foundation to benefit inner-city schools and help student- athletes take responsibility for their futures through lessons learned on the playing field, in the classroom, and throughout their local communities. On May 1, 2000, Ogden appeared on WWE Raw along with members of the Baltimore Ravens and attempted to win the WWF Hardcore Championship from Crash Holly after Holly was attacked by Steve Blackman, but was unsuccessful. In September 2009, Ogden was selected to Sporting News' Magazine's Team of the Decade (2000's). In 2010, he was placed 72nd on the list of NFL's top 100 players. He was present during the Ravens' Super Bowl XXXV reunion in 2010. Ogden has starred in commercials for Apple Ford, a dealership in Columbia, Maryland, and during his playing career, he appeared in TV advertisements for GEBCO, a local car insurance company. He also appeared in a 2012 advertisement with Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake in support of Maryland Question 7. The measure expanded gambling in the state.

It should not be confused with the nearby Large Sagittarius Star Cloud which lies about 10¬∞ to the south. The stars, clusters and other objects comprising M24 are part of the Sagittarius or Sagittarius-Carina arms of the Milky Way galaxy. Messier described M24 as a \\"large nebulosity containing many stars\\" and gave its dimensions as being some 1.5¬∞ across. Some sources, improperly, identify M24 as the small open cluster NGC 6603. The location of the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud is near the Omega Nebula (also known as M17) and open cluster Messier 18, both north of M24. M24 is one of only three Messier objects that are not actual deep sky objects. M24 fills a space of significant volume to a depth of 10,000 to 16,000 light-years. The star cloud is the most dense concentration of individual stars visible using binoculars, with around 1,000 stars visible within a single field of view. In telescopes it is best seen at low magnification, with a field of view of at least 2 degrees. Described as \\"a virtual carpet of stellar jewels\\", M24 is visible to the naked eye whenever the Milky Way itself is visible as well. It holds a collection of numerous types of stars that are visible through the galaxy's obscuring band of interstellar dust. The light of M24 is spread out over a large area, which makes estimating its brightness difficult. Older references give the star cloud's magnitude as 4.6, but more recent estimates place it a full two magnitudes brighter, at 2.5. HD 167356 is the brightest star within the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, a white supergiant with an apparent magnitude of 6.05. This star is an Alpha-2 Canum Venaticorum variable, showing small changes in brightness as it rotates. There are three other stars in M24 with visual magnitudes between 6.5 and 7.0. The star cloud incorporates two prominent dark nebulae which are vast clouds of dense, obscuring interstellar dust. This dust blocks light from the more distant stars, which keeps them from being seen from Earth. Lying on the northwestern side is Barnard 92, which is the darker of the two. Within the star field, the nebula appears as an immense round hole devoid of stars. American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard discovered this dark nebula in 1913. Along the northeast side lies Barnard 93, as large as Barnard 92 though less obvious. There are also other dark nebulae within M24, including Barnard 304 and Barnard 307. The Small Sagittarius Star Cloud also contains two planetary nebulae, M 1-43 and NGC 6567. Located within a spiral arm of the Milky Way, Messier 24 holds some similarities with NGC 206, a bright, large star cloud within the Andromeda Galaxy.

Biography Liba was born in Winnipeg, and began his journalistic career working for the Portage la Prairie Daily Telegraph and the Neepawa Press. He joined the Winnipeg Tribune in 1960, and became its city editor in 1967. An executive assistant to the leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party between 1968 and 1973, working under Gildas Molgat, Robert Bend and Israel Asper, in 1974 he joined Asper's CanWest group of companies, eventually becoming president and CEO of CKND-TV in Manitoba and SaskWest TV in Saskatchewan. He served on the Board of Directors of Atomic Energy of Canada from 1981 to 1986 with Marc Lalonde. In 1993 he was appointed executive vice-president of CanWest Global Communications Corp and was promoted to executive director of corporate affairs in 1997. He also served two terms as chairman of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, and was also president of the Western Association of Broadcasters and the Broadcasters Association of Manitoba. President of his own company, Peli Ventures Inc., from 1975 he was actively involved in several social and philanthropic groups in the Winnipeg area. In 1984 Liba was appointed a member of the Order of Canada and in 1998 was inducted into the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. The appointment as Manitoba's lieutenant- governor may have been, in part, a reflection of Canadian prime minister Jean Chr√©tien's friendship with Israel Asper. The position is largely ceremonial, and Liba had very little influence over the governments of Gary Filmon and Gary Doer. Liba was made the first member of the Order of Manitoba in 1999, and received the Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee Medal in 2004. He stepped down as lieutenant-governor just before the federal election of 2004, and was replaced by outgoing Liberal MP John Harvard. Liba died on June 21, 2007 at his cottage at Lake of the Woods.

The swelling may occur in the face, tongue, larynx, abdomen, or arms and legs. Often it is associated with hives, which are swelling within the upper skin. Onset is typically over minutes to hours. The underlying mechanism typically involves histamine or bradykinin. The version related to histamine is due to an allergic reaction to agents such as insect bites, foods, or medications. The version related to bradykinin may occur due to an inherited problem known as C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, medications known as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or a lymphoproliferative disorder. Efforts to protect the airway may include intubation or cricothyroidotomy. Histamine-related angioedema can be treated with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine. In those with bradykinin-related disease a C1 esterase inhibitor, ecallantide, or icatibant may be used. Fresh frozen plasma may be used instead. In the United States the disease affects about 100,000 people a year. Signs and symptoms Angioedema of half of the tongue Angioedema of the face, most strikingly in the upper lip. The skin of the face, normally around the mouth, and the mucosa of the mouth and/or throat, as well as the tongue, swell over the period of minutes to hours. The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands. The swelling can be itchy or painful. There may also be slightly decreased sensation in the affected areas due to compression of the nerves. Urticaria (hives) may develop simultaneously. In severe cases, stridor of the airway occurs, with gasping or wheezy inspiratory breath sounds and decreasing oxygen levels. Tracheal intubation is required in these situations to prevent respiratory arrest and risk of death. Sometimes, the cause is recent exposure to an allergen (e.g. peanuts), but more often it is either idiopathic (unknown) or only weakly correlated to allergen exposure. In hereditary angioedema, often no direct cause is identifiable, although mild trauma, including dental work and other stimuli, can cause attacks. There is usually no associated itch or urticaria, as it is not an allergic response. Patients with HAE can also have recurrent episodes (often called \\"attacks\\") of abdominal pain, usually accompanied by intense vomiting, weakness, and in some cases, watery diarrhea, and an unraised, nonitchy splotchy/swirly rash. These stomach attacks can last one to five days on average and can require hospitalization for aggressive pain management and hydration. Abdominal attacks have also been known to cause a significant increase in the patient's white blood cell count, usually in the vicinity of 13,000 to 30,000. As the symptoms begin to diminish, the white count slowly begins to decrease, returning to normal when the attack subsides. As the symptoms and diagnostic tests are almost indistinguishable from an acute abdomen (e.g. perforated appendicitis) it is possible for undiagnosed HAE patients to undergo laparotomy (operations on the abdomen) or laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) that turns out to have been unnecessary. HAE may also cause swelling in a variety of other locations, most commonly the limbs, genitals, neck, throat and face. The pain associated with these swellings varies from mildly uncomfortable to agonizing pain, depending on its location and severity. Predicting where and when the next episode of edema will occur is impossible. Most patients have an average of one episode per month, but there are also patients who have weekly episodes or only one or two episodes per year. The triggers can vary and include infections, minor injuries, mechanical irritation, operations or stress. In most cases, edema develops over a period of 12‚Äì36 hours and then subsides within 2‚Äì5 days. Diagnosis The diagnosis is made on the clinical picture. Routine blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver enzymes) are typically performed. Mast cell tryptase levels may be elevated if the attack was due to an acute allergic (anaphylactic) reaction. When the patient has been stabilized, particular investigations may clarify the exact cause; complement levels, especially depletion of complement factors 2 and 4, may indicate deficiency of C1-inhibitor. HAE type III is a diagnosis of exclusion consisting of observed angioedema along with normal C1 levels and function. The hereditary form (HAE) often goes undetected for a long time, as its symptoms resemble those of more common disorders, such as allergy or intestinal colic. An important clue is the failure of hereditary angioedema to respond to antihistamines or steroids, a characteristic that distinguishes it from allergic reactions. It is particularly difficult to diagnose HAE in patients whose episodes are confined to the gastrointestinal tract. Besides a family history of the disease, only a laboratory analysis can provide final confirmation. In this analysis, it is usually a reduced complement factor C4, rather than the C1-INH deficiency itself, that is detected. The former is used during the reaction cascade in the complement system of immune defense, which is permanently overactive due to the lack of regulation by C1-INH. Angioedema is classified as either hereditary or acquired. =Acquired angioedema= Acquired angioedema (AAE) can be immunologic, nonimmunologic, or idiopathic. It is usually caused by allergy and occurs together with other allergic symptoms and urticaria. It can also occur as a side effect to certain medications, particularly ACE inhibitors. It is characterized by repetitive episodes of swelling, frequently of the face, lips, tongue, limbs, and genitals. Edema of the gastrointestinal mucosa typically leads to severe abdominal pain; in the upper respiratory tract, it can be life-threatening. =Hereditary angioedema= Hereditary angioedema (HAE) exists in three forms, all of which are caused by a genetic mutation inherited in an autosomal dominant form. They are distinguished by the underlying genetic abnormality. Types I and II are caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene, which result in either diminished levels of the C1-inhibitor protein (type I HAE) or dysfunctional forms of the same protein (type II HAE). Type III HAE has been linked with mutations in the F12 gene, which encodes the coagulation protein factor XII. All forms of HAE lead to abnormal activation of the complement system, and all forms can cause swelling elsewhere in the body, such as the digestive tract. If HAE involves the larynx, it can cause life-threatening asphyxiation. The pathogenesis of this disorder is suspected to be related to unopposed activation of the contact pathway by the initial generation of kallikrein and/or clotting factor XII by damaged endothelial cells. The end product of this cascade, bradykinin, is produced in large amounts and is believed to be the predominant mediator leading to increased vascular permeability and vasodilation that induces typical angioedema \\"attacks\\". Pathophysiology Bradykinin plays a critical role in all forms of hereditary angioedema. This peptide is a potent vasodilator and increases vascular permeability, leading to rapid accumulation of fluid in the interstitium. This is most obvious in the face, where the skin has relatively little supporting connective tissue, and edema develops easily. Bradykinin is released by various cell types in response to numerous different stimuli; it is also a pain mediator. Dampening or inhibiting bradykinin has been shown to relieve HAE symptoms. Various mechanisms that interfere with bradykinin production or degradation can lead to angioedema. ACE inhibitors block ACE, the enzyme that among other actions, degrades bradykinin. In hereditary angioedema, bradykinin formation is caused by continuous activation of the complement system due to a deficiency in one of its prime inhibitors, C1-esterase (aka: C1-inhibitor or C1INH), and continuous production of kallikrein, another process inhibited by C1INH. This serine protease inhibitor (serpin) normally inhibits the association of C1r and C1s with C1q to prevent the formation of the C1-complex, which - in turn - activates other proteins of the complement system. Additionally, it inhibits various proteins of the coagulation cascade, although effects of its deficiency on the development of hemorrhage and thrombosis appear to be limited. The three types of hereditary angioedema are: * Type I - decreased levels of C1INH (85%); * Type II - normal levels, but decreased function of C1INH (15%); * Type III - no detectable abnormality in C1INH, occurs in an X-linked dominant fashion and therefore mainly affects women; it can be exacerbated by pregnancy and use of hormonal contraception (exact frequency uncertain). It has been linked with mutations in the factor XII gene. Angioedema can be due to antibody formation against C1INH; this is an autoimmune disorder. This acquired angioedema is associated with the development of lymphoma. Consumption of foods that are themselves vasodilators, such as alcoholic beverages or cinnamon, can increase the probability of an angioedema episode in susceptible patients. If the episode occurs at all after the consumption of these foods, its onset may be delayed overnight or by some hours, making the correlation with their consumption somewhat difficult. In contrast, consumption of bromelain in combination with turmeric may be beneficial in reducing symptoms.University of Maryland Medical Center. Angioedema. The use of ibuprofen or aspirin may increase the probability of an episode in some patients. The use of acetaminophen typically has a smaller, but still present, increase in the probability of an episode. Management = Allergic = In allergic angioedema, avoidance of the allergen and use of antihistamines may prevent future attacks. Cetirizine is a commonly prescribed antihistamine for angioedema. Some patients have reported success with the combination of a nightly low dose of cetirizine to moderate the frequency and severity of attacks, followed by a much higher dose when an attack does appear. Severe angioedema cases may require desensitization to the putative allergen, as mortality can occur. Chronic cases require steroid therapy, which generally leads to a good response. In cases where allergic attack is progressing towards airway obstruction, epinephrine may be life- saving. = Drug induction = ACE inhibitors can induce angioedema. ACE inhibitors block the enzyme ACE so it can no longer degrade bradykinin; thus, bradykinin accumulates and can cause angioedema. This complication appears more common in African-Americans. In people with ACE inhibitor angioedema, the drug needs to be discontinued and an alternative treatment needs to be found, such as an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), which has a similar mechanism but does not affect bradykinin. However, this is controversial, as small studies have shown some patients with ACE inhibitor angioedema can develop it with ARBs, as well. = Hereditary = In hereditary angioedema (HAE), specific stimuli that have previously led to attacks may need to be avoided in the future. It does not respond to antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine. Acute treatment consists of C1-INH (C1-esterase inhibitor) concentrate from donor blood, which must be administered intravenously. In an emergency, fresh frozen blood plasma, which also contains C1-INH, can also be used. However, in most European countries, C1-INH concentrate is only available to patients who are participating in special programmes. The medications ecallantide and icatibant may be used to treat attacks. In 2017 these medications cost between 5,700 and 14,000 per dose in the United States, prices that tripled in two years. In those given icatibant, specialists monitor is recommended. = Acquired = In acquired angioedema, HAE types I and II, and nonhistaminergic angioedema, antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid or Œµ-aminocaproic acid may be effective. Cinnarizine may also be useful because it blocks the activation of C4 and can be used in patients with liver disease, whereas androgens cannot. = Prophylaxis = Future attacks of HAE can be prevented by the use of androgens such as danazol, oxandrolone or methyltestosterone. These agents increase the level of aminopeptidase P, an enzyme that inactivates kinins; kinins (especially bradykinin) are responsible for the manifestations of angioedema. In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved lanadelumab, an injectable monoclonal antibody, to prevent attacks of HAE types I and II in people over age 12. Lanadelumab inhibits the plasma enzyme kallikrein, which liberates the kinins bradykinin and kallidin from their kininogen precursors and is produced in excess in individuals with HAE types I and II. History Heinrich Quincke first described the clinical picture of angioedema in 1882, though there had been some earlier descriptions of the condition.Marcello Donati. De medica historia mirabili. Mantuae, per Fr. Osanam, 1586J. L. Milton. On giant urticaria. Edinburgh Medical Journal, 1876, 22: 513-526. William Osler remarked in 1888 that some cases may have a hereditary basis; he coined the term \\"hereditary angio-neurotic edema\\". Reprint: The link with C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency was proved in 1963. Epidemiology There are as many as 80,000 to 112,000 emergency department (ED) visits for angioedema annually, and it ranks as the top allergic disorder resulting in hospitalization in the U.S.\\"Emergency Medicine, Allergy Physicians Partner to Create New Standards\\" (July 3, 2014).

The play concerns a group of seven-year-olds playing in the Forest of Dean one summer afternoon in 1943. It ends abruptly when the character Donald is burnt to death partly as a result of the other children's actions. Perhaps the most striking feature of the play is that, although the characters are children, they are played by adult actors. Potter first used this device in Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965) and returned to it in Cold Lazarus (1996). The dialogue is written in a Forest of Dean dialect, which Potter also uses extensively in other dramas incorporating a Forest of Dean setting, most notably A Beast with Two Backs (1968), Pennies from Heaven (1978) and The Singing Detective (1986). Cast The stars of the original production were: Robin Ellis (John), Michael Elphick (Peter), Colin Welland (Willie), John Bird (Raymond), Helen Mirren (Angela), Janine Duvitski (Audrey), Colin Jeavons (Donald). The screenplay has also been adapted for the theatre. The play is now a standard text for GCSE Drama in Great Britain. Title The title comes from the 40th poem in A.E. Housman's A Shropshire Lad. The poem is read by Potter himself at the end of the BBC version of the play. ::Into my heart an air that kills ::From yon far country blows: ::What are those blue remembered hills, ::What spires, what farms are those? ::That is the land of lost content, ::I see it shining plain, ::The happy highways where I went ::And cannot come again. \\"Blue remembered hills\\" is also the title of Rosemary Sutcliff's autobiography (1983).

He is best known as the founder and editor of Climate Audit, a blog devoted to the analysis and discussion of climate data. He is most prominent as a critic of the temperature record of the past 1000 years and the data quality of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He is known in particular for his statistical critique, with economist Ross McKitrick, of the hockey stick graph which shows that the increase in late 20th century global temperatures is unprecedented in the past 1,000 years.  Early life and education  McIntyre, a native of Ontario, attended the University of Toronto Schools, a college-preparatory school in Toronto, finishing first in the national high school mathematics competition of 1965. He went on to study mathematics at the University of Toronto and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1969. McIntyre then obtained a Commonwealth Scholarship to read philosophy, politics and economics (PPE) at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, graduating in 1971. Although he was offered a graduate scholarship, McIntyre decided not to pursue studies in mathematical economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Career  McIntyre worked for 30 years in the mineral business, the last part of these in the hard-rock mineral exploration as an officer or director of several public mineral exploration companies. He was a policy analyst for several years for the governments of Ontario and of Canada. He was the president and founder of Northwest Exploration Company Limited and a director of its parent company, Northwest Explorations Inc. When Northwest Explorations Inc. was taken over in 1998 by CGX Resources Inc. to form the oil and gas exploration company CGX Energy Inc., McIntyre ceased being a director. McIntyre was a strategic advisor for CGX in 2000 through 2003. McIntyre says that during his career his skills in statistical analysis enabled him to analyse mineral prospecting data and out-bet his rivals.Pearce, p. 14. Prior to 2003 he was an officer or director of several small public mineral exploration companies. He retired from full-time work, but still sometimes engaged in mining consultancy. He is an active squash player and once won a gold medal in the World Masters Games in squash doubles. In April 2011, Trelawney Mining and Exploration Inc. of Toronto, Ontario announced the appointment of McIntyre to their board of directors and then later to chairman in June 2011. In September 2011, McIntyre was appointed to the board of directors of Augen Gold Corp., which was shortly acquired by Trelawney Mining and Exploration Inc. in November 2011. In October 2011, McIntyre was appointed to the board of directors of Southeast Asia Mining Corp. and later resigned in May 2012. Trelawney Mining and Exploration Inc. was acquired by Iamgold Corporation in June 2012.  Hockey stick graph controversy  In 2002, McIntyre became interested in climate science after a leaflet from the Canadian government warning of the dangers of global warming was delivered to his residence. McIntyre states that he noticed discrepancies in climate science papers that reminded him of the false prospectus that had duped investors involved in the Bre-X gold mining scandal. The Canadian government pamphlets were based on the IPCC Third Assessment Report section, which prominently displayed the hockey stick graph based on the 1999 reconstruction by Mann, Bradley and Hughes (MBH99). McIntyre began studying Mann's research, which had produced the graph, and met Ross McKitrick. They gained considerable publicity for two papers disputing the data and methods set out in the Mann, Bradley and Hughes 1998 journal article (MBH98). McIntyre has remarked on how his suspicions of this graph were aroused: \\"In financial circles, we talk about a hockey stick curve when some investor presents you with a nice, steep curve in the hope of palming something off on you.\\" McIntyre & McKittrick's papers were cited by Senator Jim Inhofe and Representative Joe Barton to support their political criticisms of the MBH studies, and Representative Sherwood Boehlert requested the National Academy of Sciences in the United States to arrange an investigation. The outcome was the North Report, published in 2006, which endorsed the MBH studies with a few reservations. The principal component analysis method criticised by McIntyre & McKittrick had a small tendency to bias results so was not recommended, but it had little influence on the final reconstructions, and other methods produced similar results. McIntyre and McKittrick co-authored further comments, gave congressional testimony, and made numerous presentations disputing the data and methods of various multi-proxy studies.  ClimateAudit.org  McIntyre's blog has as a recurrent topic the struggle to obtain underlying data from peer reviewed papers. McIntyre has stated that he started Climate Audit so that he could defend himself against attacks being made at the climatology blog RealClimate. An earlier website, Climate2003, provided additional information for papers co-written by McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, including raw data and source code, and comments by McIntyre. On 26 October 2004 McIntyre commented on climate2003.com, \\"Maybe I'll start blogging some odds and ends that I'm working on. I'm going to post up some more observations on some of the blog criticisms.\\" On 1 December Mann and nine other scientists launched the RealClimate website. On 2 February McIntyre set up his Climate Audit blog, having found difficulties with posting comments on the climate2003.com layout. Climate Audit was co-winner of a 2007 Weblog Award for \\"Best Science Blog\\", receiving 20,000 votes in the online poll. = Auditing = Stephen McIntyre has been highlighted by the press, including The Wall Street Journal. In 2007, McIntyre started auditing the various corrections made to temperature records, in particular those relating to the urban heat island effect. He discovered a discontinuity in some U.S. records in the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) dataset starting in January 2000. He emailed GISS advising them of the problem and within a couple of days GISS issued a new, corrected set of data and thanked McIntyre for \\"bringing to our attention that such an adjustment is necessary to prevent creating an artificial jump in year 2000\\". The adjustment reduced the average temperatures for the continental United States by about 0.15 ¬∞C during the years 2000-2006. Changes in other portions of the record did not exceed 0.03 ¬∞C; it made no discernible difference to the global mean anomalies. McIntyre later commented: > My original interest in GISS adjustment procedures was not an abstract > interest, but a specific interest in whether GISS adjustment procedures were > equal to the challenge of \\"fixing\\" bad data. If one views the above > assessment as a type of limited software audit (limited by lack of access to > source code and operating manuals), one can say firmly that the GISS > software had not only failed to pick up and correct fictitious steps of up > to 1 deg C, but that GISS actually introduced this error in the course of > their programming.

While GISS > can (and has) patched the particular error that I reported to them, their > patching hardly proves the merit of the GISS (and USHCN) adjustment > procedures. These need to be carefully examined. = Role in the Climatic Research Unit controversy = Colby Cosh, writing for Maclean's magazine, believes McIntyre's criticisms of climate science are at the heart of the Climatic Research Unit email controversy in November‚ÄìDecember 2009. McIntyre is mentioned over 100 times in the hacked Climatic Research Unit (CRU) emails. In the emails, one climate researcher dismisses him as a \\"bozo\\". Others speculate over his funding, and argue about whether to ignore or counterattack him, although, according to Cosh, some unnamed scientists acknowledge that his criticisms have merit. The Associated Press analysis of the CRU e-mails stated: \\"Some e-mails said McIntyre's attempts to get original data from scientists are frivolous and meant more for harassment than doing good science. There are allegations that he would distort and misuse data given to him. McIntyre disagreed with how he is portrayed. 'Everything that I've done in this, I've done in good faith,' he said.\\" The independent Science Assessment Panel's chair, Lord Oxburgh, said at a press conference that the repeated Freedom of Information (FOI) requests made by Steve McIntyre and others could have amounted to a campaign of harassment, and the issue of how FOI laws should be applied in an academic context remained unresolved. In May 2010 BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin wrote that McIntyre \\"arguably knows more about CRU science than anyone outside the unit ‚Äî but none of the CRU inquiries has contacted him for input.\\" In March McIntyre had submitted evidence to the Independent Climate Change Email Review (chaired by Sir Muir Russell), and points he raised were discussed in the Review report published on 7 July 2010.The Independent Climate Change Email Review, an independent review funded by the UEA, chaired by Sir Muir Russell New Statesman named McIntyre as 32nd of its \\"50 People Who Matter 2010\\", citing his role in the email controversy. It said \\"The influence might not be positive, but there's no doubt he has shaped the debate.\\"  Selected publications     *  See also  * Global warming controversy * Instrumental temperature record ¬ß Calculating the global temperature  References   External links  ;McIntyre's websites and publications * ClimateAudit ‚Äî McIntyre's blog * Hockey Stick Studies ‚Äî McIntyre's compilation of Papers, Presentations etc. * Publications by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick (at McKitrick's site). * Article detailing the Wegman and North Reports with links and summarization * McIntyre's biography (.doc file, last updated in 2003) * The M&M; Project: Replication Analysis of the Mann et al.

Biography He was born on August 13, 1894, in St. Louis, Missouri. The family moved to California when Musick was 9, and he first took flight during boyhood experiments. Musick attended Los Angeles Poly for three years and continued for two years afterwards at night while working as an automobile mechanic. Musick would switch careers to become an aircraft mechanic in 1914 for the Glenn L. Martin Company. In 1938, he and his wife (the former Cleo Livingston) were living in San Francisco; they had no children. =Career= After attending an air show at Dominguez Field in January 1910, Musick built his first airplane with friends in 1912; it reached an altitude of and promptly crashed. In 1913, he learned to fly aircraft at a flight school in Los Angeles and began flying as an exhibition pilot in 1915. In June 1917 he joined the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps (later called the United States Army Air Service) in San Diego as a flight instructor for the duration of World War I, and was later transferred to airfields in Wichita Falls, Texas, and Miami, Florida. He then accepted a commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Marine Flying Corps on August 28, 1918 at Miami, Florida. After the war, he founded his own flying school in Florida and surpassed the 10,000 flying hours mark. Cuban franked Air Mail cover flown and autographed by PAA Capt. Edwin Musick on the first northbound flight of FAM 4 from Havana to Key West, Florida. October 29, 1927 Musick also flew for several airlines starting in 1920‚Äì21: Aeromarine Airways, where he studied navigation, and Mitten Air Transport, shuttling between Philadelphia and Washington DC. In October 1927, Musick joined Pan American as it was just starting operations. He made the company's inaugural mail flight to Havana, Cuba from Key West, Florida, on October 28 of that year. Musick was promoted to chief pilot for Pan American's Caribbean Division in 1930. In 1934, Musick was chosen to make the trial flights for the new Sikorsky S-42 flying boat. During these stringent test flights, Musick collected 10 world records for seaplanes; one of the test flights was a non-stop flight of . =Trans-Pacific Clipper flights= Pan American Clipper flying over the incomplete western suspension span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, c.1935 Musick's work on these trials led to him piloting the first two trans-Pacific survey routes for Pan American in 1935, laid out by Pan Am executives Juan Trippe, Andr√© Priester, and Charles Lindbergh and initially plotted by the chartered , which also carried prefabricated buildings, equipment, and supplies to establish air bases. The first survey flight from Alameda to Honolulu, landing at 10:21 AM Pacific Standard Time on April 17, 1935, took 18 hours, 21 minutes, breaking a record held jointly by six Navy aircraft; the aircraft, named Pan American Clipper, carried a consignment of 10,000 letters, the first shipment of airmail to Hawaii. Flight time was extended by half an hour as the aircraft circled over Honolulu upon arrival, to the delight of onlookers. Musick commanded a six-man crew, which included navigator Fred Noonan. The second survey flight departed Honolulu for Midway Atoll on June 15, 1935; the flight returned to Alameda on June 22. Later survey flights pushed the route to Wake Island, returning to Alameda on August 28, and Guam, returning on October 24. The Guam round-trip flight was commanded by R. O. D. Sullivan, Musick's first officer for the April flight. Musick shaking hands with a representative of the Dole Food Company in a publicity photograph staged by the nose of China Clipper (c.1936) Musick also commanded the first commercial trans-Pacific flight, carrying mail to the Philippines; the Martin M-130 China Clipper departed from Alameda on November 21, 1935 and landed in Manila on November 29, 6 days, 7 hours, and 40 minutes later, logging nearly 60 hours of flight time. The aircraft flew the trans-Pacific route surveyed in the four earlier flights, with stops in Honolulu, Midway, Wake, and Guam. Compared to the first survey flight, the initial leg to Honolulu was slowed by strong headwinds and arrived after 21 hours, 13 minutes of flight time. China Clipper returned to Alameda on December 6. He was also responsible for surveying a route to New Zealand and Australia in 1937 via Hawaii, Kingman Reef, and American Samoa; The S-42B Pan American Clipper II had arrived in Honolulu for that flight on March 18, 1937, with one of the four engines stopped due to an oil leak, requiring several days to repair. Upon his arrival in Auckland on March 29, the famously terse Musick responded to the crowd of 30,000 who had turned out the greet the flight with the brief statement \\"We are glad to be here.\\" Because of his exploits with Pan American, Musick was one of the best known pilots of the 1930s, even making the cover of Time Magazine on December 2, 1935. He received the Harmon Trophy in 1936 to recognize the first commercial flight of China Clipper. At one point during the 1930s, Musick held more flying records than any other pilot. At the time of his death, Captain Musick had reportedly flown about two million transocean miles in airline service. =Final flight= Samoan Clipper at Alameda (1937) Musick and his crew of six died in the crash of the Sikorsky S-42 Samoan Clipper (ex-Pan American Clipper II) near Pago Pago, American Samoa, on a cargo and survey flight returning from Auckland, New Zealand. Approximately 38 minutes after take-off on January 11, 1938, the aircraft reported an engine oil leak and Musick turned back toward Pago Pago after securing that engine. Their anticipated time of return was 8:30 AM local time (GMT-11). The final radio transmission from the crew was that they were dumping fuel to lighten the aircraft in preparation for a precautionary landing at 8:27 AM; shortly afterwards, an explosion tore the aircraft apart in flight. Unnamed Pan Am officials speculated at the time that the dump valves, located underneath the wing, may have vented vaporized fuel near the engines' exhaust ports, resulting in an explosion and loss of the flying boat. Once the aircraft had missed its planned return time, a search was launched for the aircraft; floating debris surrounded by an oil slick was found approximately 12 hours later, approximately northwest of Pago Pago by the U.S. naval seaplane tender . Debris was limited to charred pieces of the aircraft and its equipment; a Pan American Airways officer's jacket, later identified as belonging to the radio officer, was also recovered. However, the bodies of the seven crewmen, Capt. Edwin C. Musick, First Officer Cecil Sellers, flight officer Paul S. Brunk, navigation officer Frederick J. MacLean, radio officer Thomas D. Finley, flight engineer John W. Stickrod, and mechanic John A. Brooks were never recovered. Musick Light on Kanton Island After the crash, Pan Am abandoned plans for a base at Pago Pago and instead built a refueling station at Kanton Island, one of the Phoenix Islands in Kiribati, completing construction in July 1939. The alternate route was enabled by the arrival of the Boeing 314 Clippers, which had a longer range than the prior S-42 and M-130 Clippers. Legacy Musick Light, a lighthouse on Kanton Island, was the first structure to be dedicated for Musick, in July 1938. Musick Point in Auckland Harbour was also named after him in 1942. During World War II, a Liberty ship was christened on February 11, 1944. In 2019, the Air/Sea Heritage Foundation launched a search for the wreck of Samoan Clipper in collaboration with Search, Inc. and Ocean Exploration Trust. The search, conducted from , concluded on July 20 with nothing found.

It refers to constant-speed motion along a unit-radius great circle arc, given the ends and an interpolation parameter between 0 and 1\\\\. Geometric Slerp Slerp has a geometric formula independent of quaternions, and independent of the dimension of the space in which the arc is embedded. This formula, a symmetric weighted sum credited to Glenn Davis, is based on the fact that any point on the curve must be a linear combination of the ends. Let p0 and p1 be the first and last points of the arc, and let t be the parameter, 0 ‚â§ t ‚â§ 1\\\\. Compute Œ© as the angle subtended by the arc, so that , the n-dimensional dot product of the unit vectors from the origin to the ends. The geometric formula is then : \\\\operatorname{Slerp}(p_0,p_1; t) = \\\\frac{\\\\sin {[(1-t)\\\\Omega}]}{\\\\sin \\\\Omega} p_0 + \\\\frac{\\\\sin [t\\\\Omega]}{\\\\sin \\\\Omega} p_1. The symmetry lies in the fact that . In the limit as Œ© ‚Üí 0, this formula reduces to the corresponding symmetric formula for linear interpolation, : \\\\operatorname{Lerp}(p_0,p_1; t) = (1-t) p_0 + t p_1.\\\\,\\\\\\\\! A Slerp path is, in fact, the spherical geometry equivalent of a path along a line segment in the plane; a great circle is a spherical geodesic. Oblique vector rectifies to Slerp factor. More familiar than the general Slerp formula is the case when the end vectors are perpendicular, in which case the formula is . Letting , and applying the trigonometric identity , this becomes the Slerp formula. The factor of in the general formula is a normalization, since a vector p1 at an angle of Œ© to p0 projects onto the perpendicular ‚ä•p0 with a length of only . Some special cases of Slerp admit more efficient calculation. When a circular arc is to be drawn into a raster image, the preferred method is some variation of Bresenham's circle algorithm. Evaluation at the special parameter values 0 and 1 trivially yields p0 and p1, respectively; and bisection, evaluation at ¬Ω, simplifies to , normalized. Another special case, common in animation, is evaluation with fixed ends and equal parametric steps. If pk‚àí1 and pk are two consecutive values, and if c is twice their dot product (constant for all steps), then the next value, pk+1, is the reflection . Quaternion Slerp When Slerp is applied to unit quaternions, the quaternion path maps to a path through 3D rotations in a standard way. The effect is a rotation with uniform angular velocity around a fixed rotation axis. When the initial end point is the identity quaternion, Slerp gives a segment of a one-parameter subgroup of both the Lie group of 3D rotations, SO(3), and its universal covering group of unit quaternions, S3. Slerp gives a straightest and shortest path between its quaternion end points, and maps to a rotation through an angle of 2Œ©. However, because the covering is double (q and ‚àíq map to the same rotation), the rotation path may turn either the \\"short way\\" (less than 180¬∞) or the \\"long way\\" (more than 180¬∞). Long paths can be prevented by negating one end if the dot product, , is negative, thus ensuring that ‚àí90¬∞ ‚â§ Œ© ‚â§ 90¬∞. Slerp also has expressions in terms of quaternion algebra, all using exponentiation. Real powers of a quaternion are defined in terms of the quaternion exponential function, written as and given by the power series equally familiar from calculus, complex analysis and matrix algebra: : e^q = 1 + q + \\\\frac{q^2}{2} + \\\\frac{q^3}{6} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{q^n}{n!} + \\\\cdots . Writing a unit quaternion q in versor form, , with v a unit 3-vector, and noting that the quaternion square v2 equals ‚àí1 (implying a quaternion version of Euler's formula), we have , and . The identification of interest is , so that the real part of q is , the same as the geometric dot product used above. Here are four equivalent quaternion expressions for Slerp. : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{Slerp}(q_0, q_1, t) & = q_0 (q_0^{-1} q_1)^t \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = q_1 (q_1^{-1} q_0)^{1-t} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = (q_0 q_1^{-1})^{1-t} q_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = (q_1 q_0^{-1})^t q_0 \\\\end{align} The derivative of with respect to t, assuming the ends are fixed, is log(q1q0‚àí1) times the function value, where the quaternion natural logarithm in this case yields half the 3D angular velocity vector. The initial tangent vector is parallel transported to each tangent along the curve; thus the curve is, indeed, a geodesic. In the tangent space at any point on a quaternion Slerp curve, the inverse of the exponential map transforms the curve into a line segment. Slerp curves not extending through a point fail to transform into lines in that point's tangent space. Quaternion Slerps are commonly used to construct smooth animation curves by mimicking affine constructions like the de Casteljau algorithm for B√©zier curves. Since the sphere is not an affine space, familiar properties of affine constructions may fail, though the constructed curves may otherwise be entirely satisfactory. For example, the de Casteljau algorithm may be used to split a curve in affine space; this does not work on a sphere. The two-valued Slerp can be extended to interpolate among many unit quaternions, but the extension loses the fixed execution-time of the Slerp algorithm. Source code The below C++ code illustrates an implementation of the Slerp algorithm that handles some common edge cases. Quaternion slerp(Quaternion v0, Quaternion v1, double t) { // Only unit quaternions are valid rotations. // Normalize to avoid undefined behavior. v0.normalize(); v1.normalize(); // Compute the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. double dot = dot_product(v0, v1); // If the dot product is negative, slerp won't take // the shorter path. Note that v1 and -v1 are equivalent when // the negation is applied to all four components. Fix by // reversing one quaternion. if (dot < 0.0f) { v1 = -v1; dot = -dot; } const double DOT_THRESHOLD = 0.9995; if (dot > DOT_THRESHOLD) { // If the inputs are too close for comfort, linearly interpolate // and normalize the result. Quaternion result = v0 + t*(v1 - v0); result.normalize(); return result; } // Since dot is in range [0, DOT_THRESHOLD], acos is safe double theta_0 = acos(dot); // theta_0 = angle between input vectors double theta = theta_0*t; // theta = angle between v0 and result double sin_theta = sin(theta); // compute this value only once double sin_theta_0 = sin(theta_0); // compute this value only once double s0 = cos(theta) - dot * sin_theta / sin_theta_0; //  sin(theta_0 - theta) / sin(theta_0) double s1 = sin_theta / sin_theta_0; return (s0 * v0) + (s1 * v1); } The following is the same algorithm except in Python. It uses NumPy and can calculate multiple slerp interpolations between the two quaternions. import numpy as np def slerp(v0, v1, t_array): \\"\\"\\"Spherical linear interpolation.\\"\\"\\" # >>> slerp([1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,1], np.arange(0, 1, 0.001)) t_array = np.array(t_array) v0 = np.array(v0) v1 = np.array(v1) dot = np.sum(v0 * v1) if dot < 0.0: v1 = -v1 dot = -dot DOT_THRESHOLD = 0.9995 if dot > DOT_THRESHOLD: result = v0[np.newaxis,:] + t_array[:,np.newaxis] * (v1 - v0)[np.newaxis,:] return (result.T / np.linalg.norm(result, axis=1)).T theta_0 = np.arccos(dot) sin_theta_0 = np.sin(theta_0) theta = theta_0 * t_array sin_theta = np.sin(theta) s0 = np.cos(theta) - dot * sin_theta / sin_theta_0 s1 = sin_theta / sin_theta_0 return (s0[:,np.newaxis] * v0[np.newaxis,:]) + (s1[:,np.newaxis] * v1[np.newaxis,:]) References External links   Computer graphics algorithms Quaternions Interpolation Rotation in three dimensions Spherical geometry Articles with example Python (programming language) code ","title":"Slerp"},{"id":"960936","text":"The Hippopotamus Defence is a name for various irregular chess opening systems in which Black moves a number of pawns to the sixth rank, often developing pieces to the seventh rank, and does not move any pawns to the fifth rank in the opening.

He was 60 years old, a year younger than Joshua Millner, the oldest gold medalist at that time. When the 1912 Summer Olympics came to his native country, Sweden, he was a member of the single shot running deer team which again won the gold medal. He also won bronze again at the individual double shot running deer event, but came joint fourth in the individual single shot event, which was won by his son Alfred Swahn. At 64 years and 258 days of age, he became the oldest gold medallist ever, a record he still holds. At the 1920 Summer Olympics, he became the oldest athlete ever to compete in the Olympics at the age of 72. His best results were in the team competitions: a fourth place in the single shot running deer event, and a second place in the double shot running deer contest. With this silver medal, he is also the oldest medallist of all time (not counting the art competitions).

He established the Joe Hill House of Hospitality in Salt Lake City, Utah and practiced tax resistance. Biography Hennacy was born in Negley, Ohio, to Quaker parents, Benjamin Frankin Hennacy and Eliza Eunice Fitz Randolph, and grew up as a Baptist. He studied at three different institutions, (a year at each one): Hiram College in Ohio in 1913, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1914, and The Ohio State University in 1915. During this time Hennacy was a card-carrying member of the Socialist Party of America and in his words \\"took military drills in order to learn how to kill capitalists.\\"Ammon Hennacy, an anecdotal sketch by Don Dedera He was also the secretary of Hiram College's Intercollegiate Socialist Society.\\"In the Colleges ‚Äì The Middle West\\".The Intercollegiate Socialist, Vol. 2, No. 2. (December-January, 1913-1914), 24. At the outbreak of World War I Hennacy was imprisoned for two years in Atlanta, Georgia for resisting conscription. While in prison the only book he was allowed was the Bible. This inspired him to radically depart from his earlier beliefs; he became a Christian pacifist and a Christian anarchist. He led a hunger strike and was punished with eight months in solitary confinement. Hennacy believed that adherence to Christianity required being a pacifist and, because governments constantly threaten or use force to resolve conflicts, this meant being an anarchist. Cartoon by Art Young, first published in The Masses in 1917 and later reprinted in Ammon Hennacy's autobiography In 1919 Hennacy married his first wife, Selma Melms, under common law. He later described her as the \\"daughter of the Socialist sheriff of Milwaukee, leader of the Yipsels, as the young Socialists were called, and secretary to the President of the State Federation of Labor.\\" In May 1920, Hennacy graduated from the socialist Rand School of Social Science. In 1921, Hennacy and Melms hiked around the United States passing through all 48 of the contiguous states. He settled down in 1925, buying a farm and raising his two children. In 1931, he began social work in Milwaukee and organised one of the first social worker unions. He refused to use force or self-defense even when threatened during his work, preferring instead to use nonresistance. During this time, he also refused to sign up for the draft for World War II and declared that he would not pay taxes. He also reduced his tax liability by taking up a lifestyle of simple living. Between 1942 and 1953, Hennacy worked as a migrant farm labourer in the southwest United States. In 1952, he was baptized as a Roman Catholic by Father Marion Casey at St. Anastasia Church with Dorothy Day as his godmother. Hennacy moved to New York City in 1953, and became the associate editor of the Catholic Worker. Hennacy engaged in many picketing protests while in New York. At that time, he wrote a critical review of Witness, memoir of Whittaker Chambers, and later wrote more about his dislike of Chambers, whose wife Esther Shemitz his first wife Selma and he had known through the Rand School of Social Studies. He illegally refused to participate in New York City's annual air raid drills, and he picketed against the Atomic Energy Commission's war preparations in Las Vegas, Cape Kennedy, Washington, D.C., and Omaha. In 1958, Hennacy fasted for 40 days in protest of nuclear weapons testing. In 1961, Hennacy moved to Utah and organised the Joe Hill House of Hospitality in Salt Lake City. While in Utah, Hennacy fasted and picketed in protest of the death penalty and the use of taxes in war. Following a divorce from Selma in 1964, Hennacy married his second wife, Joan Thomas, in 1965. In the same year he left the Roman Catholic Church, though he continued to call himself a \\"non- church Christian\\". He wrote about his reasons for leaving and his thoughts on Catholicism, which included his belief that \\"Paul spoiled the message of Christ\\" (see Jesusism). This essay and others were published as The Book of Ammon in 1965, which has been praised for its \\"diamonds of insight and wisdom\\" but criticised for its rambling style. In 1968, Hennacy closed the \\"Joe Hill House of Hospitality\\" and turned his attention to further protest and writing. His second and last book, The One-Man Revolution in America, was published in 1970 and consists of seventeen chapters with each one devoted to an American radical. These included Thomas Paine, William Lloyd Garrison, John Woolman, Dorothy Day, Eugene Debs, Malcolm X, Mother Jones, Clarence Darrow and Albert Parsons. Ammon Hennacy died from a heart attack on January 14, 1970. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated and the ashes scattered over the graves of the Haymarket anarchists in Waldheim Cemetery in Chicago. Political and ethical beliefs Ammon Hennacy was a pacifist, a Christian anarchist, and an advocate of anarchism and nonresistance. He was extremely critical of what he described as the \\"institutional church\\". He did not drink or smoke and was a vegetarian. Much of his activism was anti-war, anti-nuclear proliferation, and against the death penalty. Hennacy never paid federal income taxes because they pay for the military and war. He lived a life of voluntary simplicity and believed in what he called his \\"One-Man Revolution\\" against violence, sin, and coercion. He also refused to accept the legitimacy of the judiciary. Dorothy Day said \\"Tolstoi and Gandhi, and Jesus became his teachers\\".The Long Loneliness by Dorothy Day, HarperCollins, p. 265. Influence on folk When Ani DiFranco gathered stories by Utah Phillips to make the 1996 album The Past Didn't Go Anywhere, she included his story about Hennacy, under the title \\"Anarchy\\". Hennacy helped shape Phillips, who often told this story. Film * Page, Marcus P. Blaise (2005) Bibliography * The Autobiography of a Catholic Anarchist (1954) Catholic Worker Books, New York.

The radio station building. Musick Point is the headland of the peninsula that forms the eastern shore of the Tamaki River in Bucklands Beach, a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand. In 1942 Musick Point was named after Ed Musick, a famous aviator,who visited NZ in 1937,Musick Point - Early History (from the New Zealand Association of Radio Transmitters (NZART) website. Retrieved 2007-10-02.) although the headland is also known as Te Waiarohia, after an ancient MƒÅori stronghold. Today it is occupied by a golf club and the Musick Memorial Radio Station. The peninsula itself (known as Te Naupata in MƒÅori)Manukau Council webpage terminates between the Motukorea Channel and the Tamaki Strait in the WaitematƒÅ Harbour, Auckland. The residential areas of Bucklands Beach and Eastern Beach lie immediately to the south.  History  The headland was originally used by MƒÅori of the Ngai Tai iwi (tribe), who dug a ditch across the peninsula as part of Te Waiarohia PƒÅ (sometimes recorded as Te Naupata Pa), until it was overrun by the neighbouring Ngapuhi iwi in 1821. Parts of the ditch are still clearly visible. The beaches and the sea were plentiful sources of food for the local population. In 1836, , including the point, were bought by William Thomas Fairburn, a missionary, for 90 blankets, 24 adzes, 24 hoes, 14 spades, 80 pounds (money), of tobacco, 24 combs, and 12 plain irons.Deed No.347 - Auckland District Vii Records (private land purchases), 23 January 1836 The land was later parcelled up and sold on. During the early settlers era it was called East Head. Today it is a favorite spot for walking, wedding photos, sightseeing over the harbour and for recreational fishing, as well as being the site of a golf course.  Radio station  Musick Point is the site of the Musick Memorial Radio Station, a building in the Streamline Moderne style, which was opened in 1942 to communicate with ships and aircraft. The station was the headquarters of the maritime coast station Auckland Radio ZLD, and of aviation radio ZLF. The isolation of Musick Point, with its absence of man-made electrical interference, made it an ideal radio receiving site and was a welcome improvement over Auckland Radio's previous location in the Chief Post Office in downtown Auckland, which suffered interference from Auckland's electric tramway. Transmitters for the radio station were established a few kilometres away from Musick Point, in Oliver Road, Bucklands Beach, with remote control by the operators at the Point. ZLD and ZLF were initially operated by the New Zealand Post Office before the aviation radio service was taken over by the Civil Aviation Corporation, which moved it to Auckland Airport at Mangere. Later, ownership of Auckland Radio changed to Telecom NZ Ltd, and Spark still uses the building for cellular services. During World War II, a secondary radio bunker was built 300m south of the main building in case the main station was bombed. Because the area was isolated a water tower was built to store water for the small group of houses and the single workers accommodation that was built at the same time as the station, about 500m to the south of the main radio building. Following the closure of all New Zealand coast radio stations in 1993, the equipment of Auckland Radio ZLD, including most of the Oliver Road transmitters, was acquired by the non-profit Musick Point Radio Group.Musick Point Radio Group The Group, which includes several former Musick Point operators and technicians, has a long-term lease on the building, and has reactivated the station on the amateur (ham) radio bands using some of the former ZLD transmitters along with a range of modern equipment. At a 2003 rededication of the building a plaque recognizing the \\"engineering heritage value\\" of the station was presented by the Institute of Professional Engineers New Zealand. In recognition of the station's historical importance, the Group has been issued the amateur radio callsigns ZL1ZLD and ZL1ZLF. The Group maintains a radio museum in the building and operates a low-power FM broadcast station with recorded information about Musick Point. One of MPRG's projects was keeping the traditional marine radiotelegraph frequency of 512 kHz alive, and it had a special licence to operate on this frequency which is outside the normal amateur radio bands. These transmissions ceased in mid 2013 when amateurs were allocated a new 630 metre band (427‚Äì479 kHz) and authority to operate on 512 kHz was withdrawn.

It tracked through the Caribbean, struck the Yucat√°n peninsula of Mexico as a major hurricane, and moved west-northwest into the Gulf of Mexico, briefly gaining Category 5 intensity. It was the strongest hurricane during the 1967 Atlantic hurricane season. The hurricane made landfall just north of the mouth of the Rio Grande River as a Category 3\\\\. It spawned 115 tornadoes across Texas, which established a new record for the highest amount of tornadoes produced by a tropical cyclone. Due to its slow movement over Texas, Beulah led to significant flooding. Throughout its path, at least 59 people were killed and total damage reached $234.6 million (1967 USD), of which $200 million occurred in the United States, $26.9 million occurred in Mexico, and $7.65 million occurred in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Meteorological history On August 22, 1967, an ESSA-5 satellite image depicted an area of enhanced convection‚Äîshower and thunderstorm activity‚Äîeast of the Western High Plateau in Cameroon over central Africa. Reaching the western slopes of the mountains two days later, the tropical wave became more coherent with clouds condensing along its axis. As it moved over west Africa, cyclonic rotation became apparent about above the surface. A research paper published in 1969 refers to the disturbance as a depression as it neared the west coast of Africa; however, this significantly differs from the official Atlantic hurricane database which does not mention the system at that time, as a surface circulation likely did not exist. Regardless, the system emerged over the Atlantic Ocean around 12¬∞N on August 28, as represented by barometric pressure falls in Dakar, Senegal. Once over water, the system interacted with the Intertropical Convergence Zone and continued westward along an undulating path with no further organization. It was not until a United States Navy weather reconnaissance plane flew into the disturbance on September 4, while it was located east of the Lesser Antilles, that signs of development were apparent. Corresponding observations from ships in the region on September 5 confirmed the existence of a 1010 mbar (hPa; 28.23 inHg) low-pressure area. In light of this, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC that day, with its center situated roughly 175 mi (285 km) east-northeast of Barbados. A slow-moving system, the depression steadily organized as it approached the Lesser Antilles. Observations from aircraft reconnaissance indicated that the system attained gale-force winds by 12:00 UTC on September 7, resulting in its upgrade to a tropical storm. It was also assigned the name Beulah, making it the second named storm of the 1967 season. Shortly after being named, Beulah clipped the southern coast of Martinique and entered the eastern Caribbean Sea. Feeding off the warm waters of the Caribbean, the cyclone quickly strengthened and reached hurricane intensity by 18:00 UTC on September 8\\\\. Rapid deepening ensued thereafter with the storm's central pressure falling to 940 mbar (hPa; 27.75 inHg) the following day as it passed 100 mi (160 km) south of Puerto Rico. At this time winds were estimated to be at least 140 mph (225 km/h), ranking Beulah as a Category 4 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale. Upon reaching this strength, weather radar imagery from San Juan, Puerto Rico showed that Beulah featured a 15 mi (24 km) wide eye surrounded by an intense eyewall about 8 mi (13 km) thick. Radar images of Hurricane Beulah from 21:30 UTC on September 9 to 03:30 UTC on September 10, depicting its eyewall replacement cycle During the evening of September 9 Beulah turned westward as weak ridge developed over the Bahamas, between it and the newly formed Tropical Storm Doria. The powerful storm weakened somewhat as an eyewall replacement cycle began to take shape. During this phase, the inner-eye of Beulah contracted to roughly 3‚Äì4 mi (5‚Äì6 km) in diameter while a second eyewall spanned an area 28 mi (45 km) across. The smaller eye soon dissipated and the larger one became the single, dominant feature by the morning of September 10\\\\. The completion of this marked the first time that an eyewall replacement cycle was observed in its entirety. The aforementioned westward turn placed the Dominican Republic in the line of danger, an area still reeling from the devastating effects of Hurricane Inez just one year prior. However, the storm unexpectedly collapsed as it approached the Barahona Peninsula and struck the area as a greatly weakened, though still significant, hurricane with estimated winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) around 18:00 UTC on September 11. Skirting the southern coast of Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula, Beulah further degraded to a tropical storm by the morning of September 12\\\\. Unseasonably strong wind shear associated with the jet stream, resulting from an upper-level trough to the north, and the cyclone's interaction with land were responsible for the dramatic degradation. By the time it had cleared Haiti, Beulah was no more than a minimal tropical storm with winds near 40 mph (65 km/h). Its pressure had also risen by roughly 60 mbar (hPa; 1.77 inHg) to 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53 inHg). Originally seen as a threat to Jamaica, northeasterly flow induced a southerly component to the track and pushed the cyclone south of the island on September 13\\\\. The shear previously impeding organization abated on September 14 and a ridge re- established itself to Beulah's north, allowing the storm to resume a west- northwest to northwest track. The upper-level changes led to a favorable environment for intensification and Beulah regained hurricane strength by 12:00 UTC on September 14 while located about 425 mi (685 km) south-southeast of Havana, Cuba. A composite satellite image on September 17 depicting Hurricanes Beulah (bottom), Doria (middle), and Chloe (top). Moving through the climatologically favorable western Caribbean, Beulah quickly regained major hurricane status on September 15 with winds estimated at 115 mph (185 km/h). The storm's pressure fell to 964 mb (hPa; 28.47 inHg) on September 16 before some weakening took place. Beulah ultimately made landfall on Cozumel island with winds of at least 100 mph (160 km/h) later that day and struck the mainland Yucat√°n Peninsula hours later. Despite moving over land, little weakening took place by the time the hurricane emerged over the Gulf of Mexico about 24 hours later. The hurricane maintained its intensity throughout September 18 as it moved west-northwest to southern Tamaulipas, Mexico. However, on September 19, a pronounced phase of rapid intensification took place as Beulah turned northwest to the Rio Grande Valley region. Aircraft reconnaissance throughout the day found falling pressures and ultimately measured a value of 923 mbar (hPa; 27.25 inHg) around 18:00 UTC. This was the second-lowest pressure ever recorded by aircraft at the time, behind a 920 mbar (hPa; 27.17 inHg) measurement in Hurricane Hattie of 1961. Beulah was estimated to have achieved its peak intensity shortly thereafter as a Category 5 hurricane with winds estimated at 160 mph (260 km/h). Regarded as the third- largest hurricane on record at the time, Beulah moved along a slowing, erratic, and somewhat cycloidal path. Slight weakening ensued as it neared land and Beulah ultimately made its final landfall south of Brownsville, Texas near the mouth of the Rio Grande River around 13:00 UTC on September 20\\\\. No direct measurements exist at the core of the hurricane as it moved ashore; however, based on a minimum pressure of 951 mbar (hPa; 28.09 inHg) in Brownsville, the hurricane likely struck land at an intensity below that value. A vessel anchored in the Port of Brownsville measured peak wind gusts of 136 mph (219 km/h), equivalent to a low-end Category 4 hurricane. According to the National Hurricane Center, Beulah struck as a Category 3 and had a pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 28.05 inHg), though a conclusive estimate awaits re-evaluation as part of the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project. Once over land, the hurricane slowly weakened as it remained relatively close to the coast. Winds dropped below hurricane-force on September 21, roughly 24 hours after landfall. The system subsequently stalled near Alice, Texas before turning to the southwest. After diminishing to a tropical depression late on September 22, Beulah's circulation finally dissipated over the mountainous terrain of Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico. Preparations NIMBUS satellite image of Hurricane Beulah over the Eastern Caribbean on September 9 =Hispaniola= Following Beulah's rapid intensification on September 9, a hurricane watch was issued for the whole of Hispaniola on September 9, with emphasis on a threat to the southern coast. Warnings were soon raised for areas between Barahona and Cabo Enga√±o in the Dominican Republic. Across the Dominican Republic, an estimated 200,000 people evacuated from coastal areas. =United States= Beginning on the afternoon of September 17, people were advised to remain off the beaches of Padre, Mustang, and St. Joseph Islands. Immediate evacuation of Port Aransas and Mustang, Padre, and St. Joseph Islands was advised on the morning of September 19.

Immediate evacuation of Rockport and Live Oak and Lamar Peninsulas was advised in the evening of September 19. These areas and the towns of Ingleside and Aransas Pass were nearly completely evacuated. About 50 persons remained in Rockport. The evacuation of the University of Corpus Christi was advised on the morning of September 20, and Corpus Christi Beach and parts of Flour Bluff were also evacuated.

Owing to effective evacuations, only two people lost their lives in the Dominican Republic. The core of Beulah impacted areas devastated by Hurricane Inez a year prior, and left extensive damage in its wake. Early reports indicated that more than 1,000 people were left homeless across the Barahona Peninsula. Flash flooding affected the southern coasts of both the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Beulah had limited impact on Jamaica as it brushed the island as a weak tropical storm. According to newspapers, gale-force winds affected the nation though there were no reports of damage. =Mexico= Rainfall from Hurricane Beulah across Mexico and Texas Striking Cozumel Island and the Yucatan Peninsula on September 17 as Category 2 hurricane, Beulah caused considerable damage and killed 11 people across the region.

The Puerto Morelos lighthouse on the Riviera Maya was undermined by the storm; it was never torn down and the leaning tower remains a tourist attraction in the area.Lougheed, p. 6 In M√©rida, Yucat√°n, winds were recorded up to 75 mph (120 km/h). Under the force of the powerful winds, several structures collapsed across the Peninsula, resulting in six fatalities. Nearly every buildings on Cozumel Island sustained damage, roughly half of which lost their roofs. Four people were also killed in Playa del Carmen. Along the coast, Beulah's storm surge flooded areas within of the coastline, washing out roads and leaving \\"graveyards of boats.\\" Throughout the Yucatan Peninsula, an estimated 5,000 people were left homeless and at least 30,000 were affected by the storm. Throughout Mexico, Beulah killed 19 people. Economic losses across Tampico reached 500 million pesos. =United States= In Texas upon landfall, an to storm surge inundated lower Padre Island. The force of the storm tide made 31 cuts completely through the barrier island. Padre Island suffered significant devastation, and the island's sensitive ecosystem was altered by the storm. The highest sustained wind was reported as , recorded in the town of South Padre Island, across the Laguna Madre from Port Isabel.

Design and development Sikorsky S-42, aircraft registration NC-822M, \\"Brazilian Clipper\\", Pan American Airways, 1934 During the inaugural flight of Sikorsky's previous flying boat, the S-40, on November 19, 1931, the pilot and Pan American Airways consultant, Charles Lindbergh, who considered the S-40 a monstrosity, engaged designer Igor Sikorsky in a conversation about what he thought the next airplane should look like.Daley, Robert, An American Saga, 1980, Random House, New York, , pages 102-103Delear, Igor Sikorsky: His Three Careers in Aviation, Dodd, Mead & Co., 1969 The conversation continued that night at the hotel in Jamaica. Sikorsky argued that design development should be incremental and that the safe approach would be a larger S-40. Lindbergh argued that a sleeker design, with a range in still air of 2,500 miles, was needed.Daley, Robert, An American Saga, 1980, Random House, New York, , page 103 In June 1931 Pan Am president Juan Trippe had requested designs from six aircraft companies for an aircraft able to span the oceans. The new design would need increased lifting capacity to carry enough fuel and 300 pounds of mail, but no passengers, for a 2,500 miles (4,023 kilometers) nonstop flight against a 30 mph (48 km/h) wind, at a higher cruising speed than the norm for similar flying boats at that time. Of the six companies tenders had been sent to, only Sikorsky and Martin provided submissions.Daley, Robert, An American Saga, 1980, Random House, New York, , pages 109-110 Sikorsky offered the S-42. The other offer was the more ambitious Martin M-130. The new Sikorsky design, the S-42, had major aerodynamic improvements over the S-40. Igor Sikorsky said, \\"in its very outline the S-42 represents simplicity. Diverting sharply from the past Sikorsky designs, external bracings have been reduced to a minimum. The tail, instead of being supported by outriggers, is attached directly to the hull.\\" The S-42 had a high wing loading which required flaps to provide acceptable takeoff and landing speeds. Though Lindbergh approved of the S-42, it fell far short of his proposed range. Stripped of all accommodations, with extra fuel tanks in the fuselage, the S-42 was just able to fly proving flights across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.Gunston, Bill, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Propeller Airliners, 1980, Windward, London, , page 86 Pan Am would have to wait for the Martin M-130 to have an airliner capable of flying the Pacific with a payload.Daley, Robert, An American Saga, 1980, Random House, New York, , pages 169-175 Pan Am's S-42s were used primarily on the Miami - Rio de Janeiro route. In 1937 S-42s also operated a New York-to-Bermuda service. 1940 saw S-42 flights between Seattle and Alaska. An S-42 was also used between Manila and Hong Kong.Daley, Robert, An American Saga, 1980, Random House, New York, , page 320 British Marine Aircraft Ltd. was formed in February 1936 to produce S-42A flying boats under license in the United Kingdom but nothing came of this. The company built a factory on the western side of the Hamble peninsula with a slipway to Southampton Water. When the deal fell through, the company was sold to Henry Folland, who renamed it Folland Aircraft Limited.Cruddas, Colin, In Hampshire's Skies, 2001, Tempus Publishing Limited, The Mill Brimscome Port.

Operational history 1937 ad for S-42 Clipper Flying for Pan American Airways, a total of ten S-42s were built, manufactured by the Vought-Sikorsky Aircraft Division of the United Aircraft Corporation in Stratford, Connecticut. The prototype first flew on March 30, 1934. Pan American was the sole customer for the S-42. The S-42 Pan Am Clipper surveyed the route from the US West Coast to China, making the first survey flight from Alameda, California to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in April 1935. However, S-42 aircraft never flew revenue passenger service from California to Hawaii; trans-Pacific routes were served by the larger Martin M-130 and, later, Boeing 314 Clippers. In March 1939 a Pan Am S-42 was scheduled to leave Miami at 0730, stop overnight in San Juan, Port of Spain, Belem and Recife, and arrive at Rio de Janeiro at 1530 on the fifth day. (It returned to Miami, and passengers to Buenos Aires continued on DC2/DC3s.) In early 1942 the U.S. Navy acquired one S-42 which it used as a transport in the Caribbean and to South America. All Sikorsky S-42s were either scrapped or destroyed in accidents. In 1947, inventor Lemuel Stewart purchased the fuselage of S-42 NC-822M Brazilian Clipper from Pan Am for $750.00, converted it to a six-room houseboat, and kept it docked in a boat canal in Miami, Florida. Its ultimate fate is unknown.\\"Clipper Makes Home for Floridians.\\" Wilbur Jennings via AP Newsfeatures, Paducah Sun-Democrat, Paducah, KY, April 30, 1947. {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text- align:center;font-size:90%;\\" + style=\\"font-size:125%;\\"  Sikorsky S-42 aircraft of Pan American Airways - !

Notable accidents and incidents A PAA S-42 taking off On April 11, 1936, a Pan Am S-42 crashed on takeoff from Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago, killing three of 25 on board. The pilot swerved to avoid a fishing boat that was in his path but one pontoon struck the boat and the aircraft overturned. On January 11, 1938, Pan Am Flight 1, an S-42B named Samoan Clipper (formerly Pan American Clipper II), exploded near Pago Pago, American Samoa. The flying boat developed an engine problem shortly after takeoff. The pilot elected to dump fuel before making an emergency landing, but the aircraft exploded while fuel dumping was in progress. All seven crew members (including famous aviator Captain Ed Musick), died in the crash. On October 3, 1941, Pam Am Flight 203, an S-42A named Dominican Clipper, crashed on landing in the harbour at San Juan, Puerto Rico, killing two of 27 on board. After the approach to San Juan, the aircraft hit the water in a nose-low attitude while moving sideways; after the first contact the aircraft swerved violently to the right and broke apart. On December 8, 1941, a Pan Am S-42B named Hong Kong Clipper II (formerly Bermuda Clipper and Alaska Clipper) was destroyed on the water at Kai Tak Airport, Hong Kong, during a Japanese bombing raid. On July 27, 1943, a Pan Am S-42B named Bermuda Clipper (formerly Pan American Clipper III) caught fire and burned out while docked at Manaus; there was no one on board. On August 8, 1944, Pan Am Flight 218, an S-42 named Hong Kong Clipper (formerly West Indies Clipper and Pan Am Clipper I) on a return trip from San Juan to Miami with intermediate stops at Port-au-Prince and Antilla, Cuba, crashed shortly after taking off from Antilla. After striking, bow first, the flying boat left the water in a slightly nose-high attitude, then returned, and by the third time, stalled. There were 17 fatalities (all passengers) out of the 26 passengers and five crew. Specifications (S-42) See also References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Davies, R.E.G. Pan Am: An Airline and its Aircraft.

Brown is a nightclub and stage performer as well as a comic actor, and a regular cast member of the television series Laugh-in. Brown is mostly remembered for his chubby physique, wide ingratiating smile, mobile facial expressions, and easy pleasant joking style. Brown is most famous, however, for his role as building superintendent Nathan Bookman on the 1970s CBS sitcom, Good Times. Bookman was often the brunt of fat jokes via the show's main character J. J. Evans (Jimmie Walker). Brown portrayed Bookman until the series was cancelled in 1979. Other television shows Brown has appeared on include The Flip Wilson Show, The Jeffersons, Family Matters, Sister, Sister, The Jamie Foxx Show and Martin. Brown also used to go to school with Walter Dean Myers when he lived in Harlem as a boy. In the early 1970s, Brown starred in a television commercial for the Write Brothers pen, a short-lived product of the Papermate pen company. The commercial consisted of an elaborate musical number, \\"Write On, Brothers, Write On\\", led by Brown as a schoolteacher who encourages his chorus line of students to use this pen for their school assignments. In 1997, Brown contributed his voice to the introduction of the compilation album Comedy Stew: The Best of Redd Foxx. In the introduction, Brown tells of how Norman Lear had considered Brown to play the role of Lamont in Sanford and Son, but was unavailable to do so because of his prior commitment to Laugh-In, leading Lear to give the role to Demond Wilson instead.

The seventeenth storm, tenth hurricane, and the fifth and final major hurricane of the very active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Roxanne developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea from an area of low pressure on October 7. The depression curved northward, causing it to avoid landfall in Central America. By October 9, the depression intensified enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Roxanne. On the following day, Roxanne turned west-northward, where it promptly intensified into a hurricane. As Roxanne headed generally westward, it began to rapidly deepen, and reached Category 3 intensity less than 24 hours after becoming a hurricane. Shortly thereafter, Roxanne made landfall near Cozumel, Mexico at its peak intensity, which caused severe damage. Roxanne rapidly weakened while traversing the Yucatan Peninsula, and when it emerged into the Bay of Campeche on October 12, the storm was a Category 1 hurricane. Further weakening occurred, and Roxanne was downgraded to a tropical storm later that day. Roxanne tracked northwestward and eventually re-intensified into a hurricane on October 14. Thereafter, Roxanne began to meander erratically in the Gulf of Mexico; the storm turned abruptly southeastward, and remained nearly stationary offshore of the Yucatan Peninsula. Following day, Roxanne curved back northwestward and weakened back to a tropical storm on October 17. Roxanne completed a cyclonic loop across the Gulf of Mexico on October 18. Further weakening occurred, and Roxanne was downgraded to a tropical depression on October 19. A cold front in the Gulf of Mexico turned Roxanne abruptly southward, and the storm dissipated just offshore of Veracruz on October 21. Roxanne was the first October hurricane that formed and reached Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS) in the western Caribbean Sea since Hurricane Hattie in October 1961. Due to its slow and erratic movement, Roxanne dropped heavy rainfall in many areas of southern Mexico, and some areas reported over of precipitation. Heavy rainfall, in turn, led to extensive flooding, which destroyed crop, washed out roads, and damaged at least 40,000 homes. In addition, significant coastal flooding also occurred, as storm surge for nearly a week caused water to travel inland for hundreds of yards. High winds also occurred over the Yucatan Peninsula, with one station reporting hurricane-force winds on October 11. Overall, it is estimated that Roxanne caused $1.5 billion (1995 USD) in damage, although not all damage could be distinguished from Hurricane Opal. In addition, 29 fatalities were reported. Meteorological history A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September 26\\\\. It moved westward, producing an area of convection, or thunderstorms, over the central Caribbean Sea by October 4\\\\. By two days later, the system had a broad circulation located between the coast of Honduras and the Cayman Islands. An upper-level trough, left behind after Hurricane Opal exited the region, interacted with the tropical wave and the circulation, which gradually became better organized; the origins were complex, but common for disturbances over the western Caribbean. By October 7, banding features developed within the convection. Late that day, the system organized enough for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to designate it Tropical Depression Nineteen, located off the northeast tip of Nicaragua. A day later, the Hurricane Hunters confirmed the development of the circulation. While in its formative stages, the depression moved northward, steered by a nearby upper-level low, amid weak steering currents caused by a subtropical ridge over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Early on October 9, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Roxanne. Roxanne was initially affected by winds from the north, which dislocated the circulation from the convection. As the nearby upper-level low moved into Central America, Roxanne was able to intensify, developing outflow all around the storm. Initially, the storm threatened western Cuba and the Cayman Islands, steered by a weak trough over Florida, which moved eastward and was replaced by a ridge in the area. This turned Roxanne westward toward the Yucat√°n Peninsula. At the same time it was turning, Roxanne developed a well- defined eye in the center of its convection. At 06:00 UTC on October 10, the storm intensified to hurricane status. Roxanne intensified further, based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters. Early on October 11, the NHC estimated peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h); this made Roxanne the first hurricane since Hurricane Hattie in 1961 to develop in the western Caribbean and intensify to a major hurricane. Shortly after Roxanne reached peak intensity, the hurricane made landfall just north of Tulum, a small town near Cozumel, Mexico. Roxanne making landfall on the Yucat√°n Peninsula Moving westward across the Yucat√°n Peninsula, Roxanne weakened but maintained hurricane status as it emerged into the Bay of Campeche on October 12. Although the storm remained well-organized, it lost most of its deep convection and intensity. The storm drifted in the body of water, steered by a ridge to the north. On October 12, Roxanne weakened to tropical storm status. The storm continued northwestward and turned more to the north, steered by a cold front. Roxanne redeveloped an eye feature, and it re-intensified into a hurricane on October 14. The hurricane turned to the southeast, after the cold front bypassed the system and the ridge rebuilt. Over the next day, Roxanne stalled off the northwest coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Drier air, wind shear, and upwelling caused the hurricane to weaken back to a tropical storm. By late on October 17, the circulation had little convection associated with it. The storm moved northwestward for a few days, until an approaching cold front steered Roxanne to the south on October 19; by that time, Roxanne had weakened to tropical depression status. On October 21, the circulation of Roxanne was dissipating as it moved onshore Veracruz. Preparations Early in Roxanne's existence, its northward movement presented a threat to the western Caribbean. As a result, the government of the Cayman Islands declared a tropical storm warning for all of the islands on October 9; On the same day, the government of Cuba issued a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning for Pinar del R√≠o and the Isle of Youth. The advisories were canceled after the storm turned away from the area. Parts of Mexico were under tropical cyclone warnings and watches for ten days. On October 9, the government of Mexico raised hurricane watches for coastal areas between Chetumal, Quintana Roo and Cabo Catoche. Early on October 10, a hurricane warning was declared for areas west of Cabo Catoche to Progreso, Yucat√°n. By the afternoon, the hurricane watch was extended past Progreso to Ciudad del Carmen, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning the next day. A new tropical storm warning was issued by the government of Belize that evening for areas north of Belize City; however, this warning was discontinued early on October 11 as the center of Roxanne was not expected to pass near the area. With Roxanne maintaining its intensity over the Yucat√°n, the Mexican government issued a hurricane warning from Coatzacoalcos to Tuxpan, as the storm was initially projected to go more westward. When Roxanne was looping off the northwest Yucat√°n peninsula, a hurricane warning was issued from Progreso to Tampico. The last warnings were downgraded on October 19, when Roxanne weakned to a tropical depression. In the Yucat√°n Peninsula, thousands of residents and tourists were urged to evacuate from coastal areas. In the city of Canc√∫n, roughly 12,000 tourists and 3,900 residents relocated to safer areas; however, some refused to leave and decided to wait out the storm in hotels. On Cozumel, most hotel guests decided to ride out the storm instead of evacuate. There, most homeowners and businesses stored all loose items indoors and boarded up windows. An emergency alert was issued to hundreds of fishermen off the Yucat√°n coastline to move to port immediately. In the state of Campeche, 150 shelters were opened and able to accommodate roughly 15,000 people. However, more than 20,000 people sought refuge from the storm throughout the state. Impact Roxanne Rainfall across Mexico Roxanne affected the Yucat√°n Peninsula less than two weeks after Hurricane Opal formed in the area. The combined damage between the two hurricanes was estimated at US$1.5 billion. At least two locations in Mexico reported sustained hurricane force winds from Roxanne - M√©rida, Yucat√°n and Para√≠so, Tabasco. At the former location, an automatic weather station recorded a wind gust of 202 km/h (125 mph) on October 11\\\\. Roxanne dropped heavy rainfall along its path. Near Champot√≥n, Campeche, a pluviometer recorded of precipitation, the highest total in the country related to Roxanne. Locations in Veracruz and Tabasco also recorded over of rainfall. While Roxanne was moving ashore eastern Mexico, it produced an estimated storm surge of . Waves washed into hotel lobbies in Cancun and Cozumel. In the Gulf of Mexico, waves struck the Mexican coast while Roxanne drifted offshore for a few days, pushing water hundreds of yards inland. Waves eroded the eastern portion of Ciudad del Carmen, while the western portion of the island gained sand. Roxanne caused 29 deaths, with six of them coming from the sinking of the pipelay derrick barge DLB 269 with 245 people on board.Michael Krieger (2003): All the Men in the Sea. The Untold Story of One of the Greatest Rescues in History, Simon and Schuster Roxanne caused widespread flooding and agriculture damage in eastern Mexico, notably in Campeche, Tabasco, Veracruz. Along the coast, high waves wrecked docks, fishing stalls, and nets while damaging dozens of boats. Across eastern Mexico, Roxanne damaged more than 40,000 homes. Crops were destroyed, cattle drowned, and roads were either washed out or blocked by mudslides. The road between the City of Carmen and Campeche was completely destroyed. Rainfall and storm surge combined with overflowing rivers caused the worst flooding in Campeche since 1927. Floodwaters damaged the aqueduct for Ciudad del Carmen. Throughout the state of Tabasco, nearly half of the highways sustained significant damage. Governor Roberto Madrazo Pintado estimated that it would cost roughly $60 million to repair them. Roxanne caused the state owned Pemex to shut down 90% of its drilling in the Gulf of Mexico during its pass as well as halt all shipments from three oil terminals in the southeastern region of the gulf.HighBeam As a result, Mexico lost millions of dollars. Oil production dropped from 2.838 million barrels a day in September to 1.976 million barrels a day in October or 30.4%.http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=50&pid;=57&aid;=1&cid;=&syid;=1995&eyid;=1996&freq;=M&unit;=TBPD (A rough guess using a price of the Maya Crude averaging about $13.77/b,http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s;=WEPCMXMAY&f;=W 30 days in September, and 862,000 barrels a day of lost output yields $356 million, which in 2011 dollars equals about $530 million.) Oil production didn't completely recover in November, so there were some additional losses, but did completely return in December. Aftermath Due to the scale of the damage in Mexico, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Roxanne, meaning it will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced on the naming list with Rebekah, which was used for the first time in 2019. The Mexican government allocated 16 million pesos to people affected by Roxanne, as well as 55 million pesos to fishermen.

He served as a federal Member of Parliament from 1988 to 2004, and was appointed the 23rd Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba just before Canada's 2004 federal election. Career Harvard was a broadcast journalist from 1957 to 1988. He worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for eighteen years and was for many years the host of a popular call-in show in Winnipeg called Talk Back, on CJOB radio. Coincidentally, his predecessor as lieutenant-governor, Peter Liba, worked as a journalist for CBC's competitor CanWest. Member of Parliament Harvard was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1988 election as a Liberal, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative George Minaker by 18,695 votes to 16,993 in the middle-class suburban riding of Winnipeg‚ÄîSt. James (in the previous election, the Liberal candidate had finished third). Harvard sat as a backbench member of the parliamentary opposition from 1988 to 1993. The Liberal Party won the 1993 federal election, and Harvard was easily re-elected in Winnipeg‚ÄîSt. James, defeating his nearest competitor, Reformer Peter Blumenschein, by about 13,000 votes. He was not appointed to cabinet, but was named Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services in 1996. Harvard was again re-elected without difficulty in the federal election of 1997, running in the redistributed riding of Charleswood‚ÄîAssiniboia. He was named parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food after the election, serving until 1998. Harvard faced his most difficult bid for re-election in the 2000 campaign, narrowly defeating Canadian Alliance challenger Cyril McFate by 13,901 votes to 11,569. Progressive Conservative Curtis Moore finished third with 9991 votes, causing many to regard the riding as winnable for a \\"united right\\" in the next election. Harvard supported Paul Martin for the Liberal Party leadership over a period of several years, and it was perhaps for this reason that he was never called into the cabinet of Jean Chr√©tien. As early as 2000, Harvard publicly suggested that Chr√©tien should consider resigning as party leader. When Martin became prime minister on December 12, 2003, Harvard was sworn into the Privy Council as parliamentary secretary to the minister of international trade. Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba Harvard resigned his parliamentary seat on May 6, 2004. It is rumoured that this was done at the urging of Winnipeg mayor Glen Murray, who was seeking the Liberal candidacy for a Winnipeg-area riding in the upcoming federal election. It was announced the next day that Harvard would be appointed lieutenant-governor of Manitoba, and he was sworn in on June 30. Murray was unable to retain the seat for the Liberals. The position of lieutenant-governor is largely ceremonial, and Harvard held very little direct influence over the government of Manitoba. While serving as the LG, as is the tradition, he and his then-spouse, Her Honour, Lenore Berscheid, resided in Government House (Manitoba) in Winnipeg. Later life and death In October 2005, Harvard was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Manitoba. In August 2009, after his term ended, he was succeeded by Lieutenant-Governor by Philip S. Lee. Harvard died at the age of 77 on January 9, 2016 (cancer).http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/Free-Press-Head-Start- for-Monday-Jan-11-364672851.html Arms References External links * 1938 births 2016 deaths Liberal Party of Canada MPs Lieutenant Governors of Manitoba Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Manitoba Members of the Order of Manitoba Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Politicians from Winnipeg 21st-century Canadian politicians ","title":"John Harvard (politician)"},{"id":"961016","title":"Water polo at the 1908 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"961022","text":"Edgar Johnson Goodspeed (1871‚Äì1962) was an American theologian and scholar of Greek and the New Testament. He taught for many years at the University of Chicago, whose collection of New Testament manuscripts he enriched by his searches. The University's collection is now named in his honor. He is widely remembered for his translations of the Bible: The New Testament: an American Translation (1923), and (with John Merlin Powis Smith) \\"The Bible, An American Translation\\" (1935), the \\"Goodspeed Bible\\". He is also remembered for his translation of the Apocrypha, and that translation was included in The Complete Bible, An American Translation (1939). Finally, Harper & Brothers issued his widely heralded The Apostolic Fathers: An American Translation (1950). Edgar J. Goodspeed was born in Quincy, Illinois.

It is located at 550 metres (1,804 ft) in the south-west of Piedmont, at the confluence of the rivers Stura and Gesso. Cuneo is bounded by the municipalities of Beinette, Borgo San Dalmazzo, Boves, Busca, Caraglio, Castelletto Stura, Centallo, Cervasca, Morozzo, Peveragno, Tarantasca and Vignolo. It is located near six mountain passes: *Colle della Maddalena at *Colle di Tenda at - Tunnel of Tenda at , long *Colle del Melogno at *Colle San Bernardo at *Colle di Nava at *Colle di Cadibona at . History Cuneo was founded in 1198 by the local population, who declared it an independent commune, freeing themselves from the authority of the bishops of Asti and the marquisses of Montferrat and Saluzzo. In 1210, the latter occupied it, and in 1231 the Cuneesi rebelled. In 1238, they were recognized as a free commune by Emperor Frederick II. In 1259, the independence of Cuneo ceased forever, as it gave itself, also to take protection against its more powerful neighbours, to Charles I of Anjou, who was then King of Naples and Count of Provence. Together with Alba, it was the main Angevine possession in Northern Italy; Angevine rule interrupted by periods under the control of Saluzzo, Savoy, and the Visconti of Milan) was ended in 1382 when Cuneo was acquired by the Duchy of Savoy. Cuneo became an important stronghold of the expanding Savoy state. The city was thus besieged several times by France: first in 1515 by Swiss troops of Francis I of France, then again in 1542, 1557, 1639, 1641, 1691 and, during the War of the Austrian Succession, in 1741. Cuneo resisted each siege successfully. The city was taken by France only during the Napoleonic Wars and was made the capital of the Stura department. After the restoration of the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the unification of Italy, Cuneo became the capital of its namesake province in 1859. During World War II, from 1943 to 1945, it was one of the main centres of partisan resistance against the German occupation of Italy. In 1943, Cuneo's Jewish residents were briefly arrested and imprisoned at the nearby Borgo San Dalmazzo concentration camp by the order of Minister of the Interior Guido Buffarini Guidi. They were freed before the Minister's orders came into effect and most community members fled Cuneo into hiding. However, on December 9, 1944, the Cuneo Police Department reopened the camp and imprisoned the remaining Jewish residents of Cuneo most of whom were then deported to Auschwitz. Few survived according to reports. Italian partisans liberated Cuneo from the German and Italian fascist occupation on April 25, 1945. The retreating fascist forces murdered the remaining six Jewish prisoners being held at Cuneo's local prison.P. Bianchi- Andrea Merlotti, Cuneo in et√† moderna (2003), 103‚Äì13, 301‚Äì14A.

However, it is situated more than above sea level, which helps to make summers more bearable: the hottest month, July, has an average temperature of . The coldest, January, averages . Annual precipitation is about , distributed over 81 days. The rainfall pattern is similar to that of Turin, with two maxima‚Äîone primary and one secondary (spring and autumn) and two minima (summer and winter). The driest month is July, . Snowfalls are frequent owing to high elevation and wind patterns. Cuisine and food Cuneo's specialty is Cuneesi al rhum, small meringues with dark chocolate coating and a rum-based chocolate filling. They are a creation of Andrea Arione (1923), who also registered the name, and sold them in the bar still located in the central square, Piazza Galimberti; another claim makes them a creation of pastry chef Pietro Galletti from Dronero.

Sub-category N2 is used for vehicles between 3,500 kg and and N3 for all goods vehicles over 12,000 kg as defined in Directive 2001/116/EC. The term medium goods vehicle is used within parts of the UK government to refer to goods vehicles of between 3,500 and 7,500 kg which according to the EU are also \\"large goods vehicles\\". Commercial carrier vehicles of up to 3,500 kg are referred to as light commercial vehicles and come into category N1. Confusingly though, parts of the UK government refer to these as \\"large goods vehicles\\" (also abbreviated \\"LGV\\"), with the term LGV\\" appearing on tax discs for these smaller vehicles. Tax discs use the term \\"HGV\\" or \\"LGV\\" for vehicles over 3.5 tonnes. To cross boundaries in the EU, LGVs must not exceed 44 tonnes laden weight or longer than , but longer and heavier vehicles (LHVs) are used within some EU states, where they are known as Gigaliner, EuroCombi, EcoLiner, innovative commercial vehicle, mega-truck, and other names. They are typically long and weigh up to 70 tonnes, and the implications of allowing them to cross borders was considered in 2011. Driver licensing =European Union= It is necessary to have an appropriate European driving licence to drive a large goods vehicle in the European Union. There are four categories: *Category C1 allows the holder to drive a large goods vehicle with a maximum authorised mass (gross vehicle weight) of up to with a trailer having a maximum authorised mass of up to . This licence can be obtained at 18 years of age and is the replacement for the HGV Class 3 in the UK (the old HGV Class 3 being any two-axle goods vehicle over 7,500 kg). *Category C1+E allows the holder to drive a large goods vehicle with a maximum authorised mass (gross vehicle weight) of up to 7500 kg with a trailer over 750 kg maximum authorised mass, provided that the maximum authorised mass of the trailer does not exceed the unladen mass of the vehicle being driven, and provided that the combined maximum authorised mass of both the vehicle and trailer does not exceed . *Category C allows the holder to drive any large goods vehicle with a trailer having a maximum authorised mass of up to 750 kg. This is effectively the new GV Class 2 in the UK, the old HGV Class 2 being any rigid goods vehicle with more than two axles. A driver can commence training for a Category C licence from 18 years old. *Category C+E: allows the holder to drive any large goods vehicle with a trailer having a maximum authorised mass of over 750 kg. This licence could only be obtained after 6 months' experience with a Class 2 truck, but more recently the law has changed so that it is now possible to take the tests back-to-back (Category C first then C+E the following week). This is the new Class 1 licence. Operator Licensing Operation of heavy goods vehicles for commercial reasons in European Union requires an operator's licence. This allows member states to regulate companies operating these vehicles enforcing number of safety requirements which includes driver's hours regulations and vehicle safety standards. Obtaining appropriate operator's licence is a minimum requirement to use HGV or LGV on public road in European Union. UK Drivers who passed a Category B (car) test before 1 January 1997, will have received Categories C1 and C1+E (Restriction Code 107: not more than ) through the Implied Rights issued by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) (more commonly known as Grandfather Rights). All UK LGV licence holders must undergo a strict medical examination and eye test on application, at age 45 and every 5 years thereafter. On reaching 65 years of age, a medical examination must be performed on an annual basis. =Canada= In the Canadian province of Ontario, drivers holding a Full Class A licence can drive any truck/tractor trailer combination, a combination of motor vehicle and towed vehicles where the towed vehicles exceed a total gross weight of and has air brakes, or a vehicle pulling double trailers. Drivers holding a Class B (school bus), C (regular bus) or D (heavy truck) licence can drive a truck with a gross weight or registered gross weight exceeding or any truck and trailer combination exceeding 11,000 kg gross weight or registered gross weight provided the towed vehicle is not over 4,600 kg. =New Zealand= There are four classes of heavy vehicle licence: 2, 3, 4 and 5. Classes 1 and 6 are for light vehicles and motorcycles, respectively. The classes describe the characteristics of the vehicle, the weight limits and the maximum number of axles. Drivers must begin with a class 2 (medium rigid vehicle) learner licence before progressing to a class 3 medium combination vehicle licence or a class 4 heavy rigid vehicle licence. A class 5 (heavy combination vehicle) licence can only be earned after driving with a class 4 licence for a specific time-frame (depending on age), or completing an accelerated course. As New Zealand has a graduated driver licensing system, drivers must pass a theory test before being allowed to drive on the road. They can then drive with a supervisor for six months followed by a practical test, or they can complete an accelerated heavy vehicle course. Safety LGVs and their drivers are covered by strict regulations in many jurisdictions; for example, to improve safety, limit weight to that which will not excessively wear the transport infrastructure (roads, bridges, etc.). The heavy weight of these vehicles leads to severe consequences for other road users in crashes; they are over-involved in fatal crashes, and in a 2013 study in London, were found to cause a disproportionate number of the annual casualty toll of cyclists.

Elections to the House of Representatives =Special election (2001)= After his father, Republican U.S. Congressman Bud Shuster, resigned from congress in January 2001 following a strong rebuke from the House ethics committee for his relationship with a transportation lobbyist, Bill Shuster ran for Pennsylvania's 9th congressional district. On February 18, 2001, he won the Republican nomination with 59% of the vote, defeating State Representative Patrick Fleagle (32%) and Blair County Commissioner John Eichelberger (9%). On May 15, 2001, Shuster won the special election, defeating Democratic Centre County Commissioner Scott Conklin 52%‚Äì44%. Shuster won nine of the district's eleven counties. Conklin won Centre (58%) and Clearfield (55%). To date, it is the last time that a Democrat has come close to winning what has long been one of the most Republican districts in Pennsylvania. =Bush era elections (2002, 2004, and 2006)= In the redistricting after the 2000 Census, Centre County was taken out of the district while portions of Somerset, Cambria, Indiana, Fayette, and Cumberland Counties were added to the district. In November 2002, the district reverted to form, and Shuster won his first full term, defeating John R. Henry 71%‚Äì29%. Unlike 2002, Shuster was challenged in the 2004 Republican primary. He defeated businessman Michael DelGrosso 51%‚Äì49%. In November, he won re- election to his second full term, defeating Democrat Paul Politis 70%‚Äì30%, winning every county in the district. Shuster won re-election to his third full term in 2006, defeating Democrat Tony Barr 60%‚Äì40%. He lost only three counties: Clearfield, Cambria, and Fayette. =Obama era elections (2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014)= Shuster won re-election to his fourth full term in 2008, defeating Democrat Tony Barr again, 64%‚Äì36%. This time he won all fourteen counties. In 2010, Shuster won re-election to his fifth full term, defeating Democrat Tom Conners 73%‚Äì27%, winning all fourteen counties. After redistricting following the 2010 Census, the 9th moved even further to the west, gaining portions of Westmoreland, Greene, and Washington Counties. Shuster won re-election to his sixth full term, defeating Democrat Karen Ramsburg 62%‚Äì38%. With the 113th Congress, elected in 2012, Bill Shuster became Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, a position he would hold for the following 2 Congresses. In 2014, Shuster was in a primary with Bedford County businessman Art Halvorson and Franklin County project manager Travis Schooley. The primary was held on May 20, 2014. Shuster won with 53% of the vote. Art Halvorson received 34% and Travis Schooley received 13%. In 2015, Shuster, who was the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman, said he was dating Shelley Rubino, the vice president of government affairs for Airlines for America (A4A), a lobbying group for airlines. Politico said their relationship had started in summer 2014 and had signed an agreement that Rubino would not lobby Shuster or his staff. Shuster, however, had other ties to A4A, having hired a former A4A executive onto the aviation subcommittee, and Shuster's chief of staff is married to an executive of A4A. Politico also noted the similarity to his father's conflicted lobbyist relationship and resignation. =Trump era election (2016) and retirement= In 2016, Shuster won reelection in what would later turn out to be his eighth and final full term. He was challenged by Arthur Halvorson in the Republican primary, with Shuster only barely winning a majority, at 50.6%, in the two-way race. Described as \\"one of the more bizarre and nasty congressional campaigns\\", Shuster's ex-wife was in his campaign ads, defending him and their family. In a set of events that even Shuster's opponent described as unprecedented, Halvorson received enough write-ins in the Democratic primary to become the Democratic Party's candidate in the 9th District. Halvorson, who is considered to be further to the right than Shuster, accepted the Democratic nomination, but vowed to caucus as a conservative Republican if elected to Congress. In the general election, Shuster beat Halvorson again, this time with 63.3% of the vote.2016 congressional election in PA-9 on Ballotpedia Shuster announced in January 2018 that he wouldn't be seeking reelection later that year, and that he thus would be retiring with the end of the 115th Congress in January 2019. The Congressman, who has been Chairman of the House Transportation Committee since 2013, said he would be spending his final year in the House working with President Trump on what he describes as a \\"massive infrastructure bill\\". Shuster cited his desire to pass such a bill, and the fact that worrying about getting reelected would distract from that, as reasons for his retirement. Time in the House of Representatives =Political positions= Shuster has been a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee since being elected in 2001 and was selected to be chairman of the committee for the 113th Congress. His father had chaired the committee from 1995 to 2001. In 2013, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee as well, Shuster was an opponent of the $380 million Medium Extended Air Defense System project, which has been deemed too expensive by the Army to complete. Shuster held a 90.64 percent lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union in 2012. He opposes abortion, consistently receiving a 0 percent rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood and a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee. A strong supporter of gun rights, Shuster has supported the interests of Gun Owners of America and received an A rating from the National Rifle Association in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012. Shuster does not rate highly with education unions. The National Education Association has given Shuster a grade of F and he was given a rating of 25 percent by the National Association of Elementary School Principals in 2007. Shuster has received the \\"Spirit of Enterprise Award\\" from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and rated highly on the scorecards of the National Tax Limitation Committee and American Farm Bureau Federation. Shuster was a state co-chair for the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney. In May 2013, Shuster introduced H.R. 2125, the No IRS Implementation of Obamacare Act; the bill sought to bar the stated that the Internal Revenue Service violated the public trust and cannot be relied on to implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Shuster sponsored The Water Resources and Redevelopment Act of 2013 (WRRDA). He sponsored this bill from his position as the House Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. In January 2014, Shuster created a bipartisan panel of legislators to examine ways to use public-private partnerships to carry out various types of projects, such as water infrastructure, transportation and economic development, according to Ripon Advance.(2014-01-21). \\"Shuster seeks to enhance public-private partnerships \\". Ripon Advance. Retrieved January 21, 2014. =Legislation sponsored= * Home Heating Emergency Assistance Through Transportation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4076; 113th Congress) ‚Äì Shuster introduced this bill on February 25, 2014. The bill would create an emergency exception to existing Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulations. The exceptions would allow truckers to drive for long hours if they are delivering home heating fuels, such as propane, to places where there is a shortage. Shuster argued in favor of the bill saying that the bill \\"will provide relief for millions of Americans suffering from the current propane and home heating fuel emergency.\\" According to the Congressman, an \\"exceptionally cold winter\\" increased demand on propane, \\"which is used for heating approximately 12 million homes in the United States.\\" * Transparent Airfares Act of 2014 (H.R. 4156; 113th Congress) ‚Äì Shuster introduced this bill on March 6, 2014.

Shuster spoke in favor of the bill, describing it as a bill that \\"ensures the men and women of the Coast Guard have the tools they need to carry out their critical missions, enforce our laws on U.S. waters and on the high seas, and safeguard our Nation's maritime interests around the world.\\" =Committee assignments= * Committee on Armed Services  Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities * Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure (Chairman)  Subcommittee on Highways and Transit  Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials  Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment =Caucus memberships= * Army Corps Reform Caucus * Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus ‚Äì Co-Chairman * Depot Caucus * Intelligent Transportation Caucus *United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus * Older Americans Caucus * Sportsmen's Caucus * Congressional Cement Caucus * Ohio River Basin Congressional Caucus * Republican Main Street Partnership.

The population of the civil parish as taken at the 2011 Census was 909. It lies at an altitude of in the valley of the River Derwent in the Peak District National Park. On the west side of the valley is the high Sir William Hill, and to the south-east lies the gritstone escarpment of Froggatt Edge. Grindleford became a parish in 1987, merging the parishes of Eyam Woodlands, Stoke, Nether Padley and Upper Padley. The nearest city to Grindleford is Sheffield, the centre of which is about away. For rail travellers, the Sheffield suburb of Totley is less than three miles away at the other end of the Totley Tunnel, the second-longest rail tunnel in the UK. Grindleford railway station (actually located in Upper Padley, half a mile away from the village) is at the western portal of the rail tunnel, on the scenic Hope Valley Line between Sheffield and Manchester. Grindleford is popular with walkers and climbers due to its proximity to a variety of landscapes, including open moorland, wooded river valleys (including Padley Gorge), several gritstone escarpments, and the broad Hope Valley. Visitors seeking refreshment are well catered for by a number of establishments, including the Sir William Hotel, the Maynard Hotel and Bar, the National Trust Longshaw Estate Visitor Centre, and Grindleford Station Cafe (in the old station house).  Education  The village has one school, Grindleford Primary School. It was rated as \\"good\\" in its March 2018 Ofsted report.

It is a medium-sized tree in the family Loganiaceae that grows in open habitats. Its leaves are ovate and in size. It is a major source of the highly poisonous, intensely bitter alkaloids strychnine and brucine derived from the seeds inside the tree's round, green to orange fruit.Oudhia, P., 2008. Strychnos nux-vomica L. [Internet] Record from PROTA4U. Schmelzer, G.H. & Gurib-Fakim, A. (Editors). PROTA (Plant Resources of Tropical Africa / Ressources v√©g√©tales de l‚ÄôAfrique tropicale), Wageningen, Netherlands. The seeds contain approximately 1.5% strychnine, and the dried blossoms contain 1.0%. However, the tree's bark also contains brucine and other poisonous compounds. Strychnos is promoted within alternative medicine as a treatment for many conditions, but the claims are not supported by medical evidence. The use of strychnine is highly regulated in many countries, and it is mostly used in baits to kill feral mammals. Most accidental poisoning is caused by breathing in the powder or by absorption through the skin.  Description and properties  Seeds of S. nux-vomica Strychnos nux- vomica is a medium-sized tree with a short, thick trunk. The wood is dense, hard white, and close-grained. The branches are irregular and are covered with a smooth ashen bark. The young shoots are a deep green colour with a shiny coat. The leaves have an opposite decussate arrangement (each opposing pair of leaves at right angles to the next pair along the stem), are short stalked and oval shaped, have a shiny coat, and are smooth on both sides. The leaves are about long and wide. The flowers are small with a pale green colour and a funnel shape. They bloom in the cold season and have a foul smell. The fruit are about the size of a large apple with a smooth and hard shell that when ripened is a mild shade of orange in colour. The flesh of the fruit is soft and white with a jelly-like pulp containing five seeds covered with a soft, woolly substance. The seeds have the shape of a flattened disk completely covered with hairs radiating from the center of the sides. This gives the seeds a very characteristic sheen. The seeds are very hard, with a dark gray horny endosperm where the small embryo is housed that gives off no odor but possesses a very bitter taste. Seedling of nux vomica  Ecology  The fruit is eaten by monkeys and birds, such as the gray langur.  Uses  The strychnine-containing seeds have been used in arrow poison. = Herbalism = Bark of Strychnos nux-vomica Strychnos is promoted within herbal medicine as being a treatment for a wide range of maladies, including cancer and heart disease. There is, however, no evidence it is useful for treating any condition. Indeed, these seeds contain strychnine poison. The plant appears on the Commission E list of unapproved herbs because it has not been proven to be safe or effective and thus is not recommended for use. In Ayurveda (the Indian system of folk medicine), hudar is a mixture containing Strychnos nux-vomica. The seeds are first immersed in water for five days and then in milk for two days followed by their boiling in milk. The level of toxic alkaloids in the unprocessed Strychnos seeds used in traditional medicines can be determined using established HPLC methods and HPLC-UV methods.

He is best known for his advocacy of transportation projects, including Interstate 99. Early life and career Shuster was born in the Pittsburgh suburb of Glassport, Pennsylvania, the son of Grace (n√©e Greinert) and Prather Leroy Shuster. He received his B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh in 1954, where he became a member of Sigma Chi, an M.B.A. from Duquesne University in 1960, and a Ph.D. from American University in 1967. Shuster's official congressional biography states that he served in the United States Army from 1954 to 1956. However, he was the author of several books, one of which was titled Believing in America published in 1983. In this book Shuster states that he was the class president at the University of Pittsburgh and was recruited by the local CIA office on campus and that this was his actual first employment. Shuster describes his role as that of infiltrating civil rights groups eerily similar to COINTELPRO operations of the FBI. Shuster claimed that communist groups were penetrating the civil rights movement to provoke the police into attacking the demonstrators who were marching for equal rights for African-Americans. He claimed communists did this to embarrass the United States in front of the world. His book completely contradicts his later claims to have been in the military. After leaving behind college and military life, Shuster entered the business world. He became a vice-president at RCA, and he made a fortune when he started his own computer business. Congressional service In 1972, Shuster decided to enter politics when he entered the Republican primary for the 9th District. The district had previously been the 12th, represented by five-term Republican J. Irving Whalley, who was retiring. He defeated popular state senator D. Elmer Hawbaker of Mercersburg in the Republican primary‚Äìthe real contest in what has long been one of the most Republican districts in Pennsylvania. The 9th and its predecessors have been in Republican hands for all but six years since 1927. He breezed to election that November. Shuster's election to Congress was on the coattails of President Nixon's sweeping re- election victory. As the Watergate revelations against those closest to the president mounted, Shuster adamantly supported the president. Even after the Saturday Night Massacre, in which independent counsel Archibald Cox was fired because he refused to back down in the face of an order by the president to withdraw a subpoena for White House tapes, an event which severely eroded Congressional Republican support and set in motion the impeachment process, Shuster chose to strike out against Cox. On October 31, 1973, Shuster introduced House Resolution 677, which called for an investigation by Congress of Archibald Cox and the staff of the Special Prosecutor's office \\"to determine the extent of criminal violations\\" and send the findings to the Justice Department for prosecution. He accompanied the resolution with a statement about Cox: \\"This pompous, pious, self-righteous, supposedly independent special prosecutor is far worse than just political.\\" The resolution was referred to the House Judiciary Committee on November 15, 1973, where it died. A year later, even as many Republicans went down to defeat in the face of anti-Watergate backlash, Shuster won a second term with 56 percent of the vote. In Congress, Shuster was one of the opponents of the automobile airbag.Mary Russell, House Signals Opposition to Airbags, Washington Post, June 13, 1978 He ran for the position of Minority Whip in 1980, losing to Trent Lott. Shuster chaired the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure from 1995 to 2001. Shuster usually skated to re-election. His bid for a second term would be the only time he would drop below 60 percent of the vote. His most notable challenger came in 1984 when Nancy Kulp, the actress who played Miss Jane Hathaway on The Beverly Hillbillies won the Democratic nomination. Kulp, a native of Pennsylvania, had returned to her home state upon her retirement from acting and received support from her friends in Hollywood. Kulp's former co-star Buddy Ebsen, a Republican, contacted the Shuster campaign and volunteered to record radio spots declaring, \\"Hey Nancy, I love you dearly but you're too liberal for me ‚Äì I've got to go with Bud Shuster.\\" Shuster went on to win re-election with two- thirds of the vote. It would be the next-to-last time he would face any opposition at all; from 1986 to 2000, only one Democrat even filed to run against him. Shuster is best known for taking on his party leadership and President Bill Clinton in the 1990s to keep more of the taxes on motor fuels and air travel in the dedicated federal trust funds they were supposed to go to by law. Shuster won both battles, even though then-Speaker Newt Gingrich and Clinton united to oppose him, wanting to keep the funds available for borrowing for other programs.Patriot-News of Harrisburg, Jan. 7, 2001. Those victories meant during his time as chairman numerous transportation projects were funded, including Interstate 99, the only Interstate highway to have its route number (a violation of the usual Interstate numbering standard) written into law. The route was later named the \\"Bud Shuster Highway\\" by Governor Robert Casey. When the transportation authorization bill known by its initials as \\"BESTEA\\" was under consideration, his fellow members joked the letters stood for the \\"Bud E. Shuster Transportation for All Eternity Act\\" for its many \\"pork barrel\\" projects. In 1996, Shuster was the focus of an ethics investigation by the Congressional Accountability Project stemming from the complex relationship between Representative Shuster and Ann Eppard, a former Shuster aide turned lobbyist, and Rep. Shuster's interventions with federal agencies on behalf of a business partner of his sons. In 1998 Eppard was indicted for taking bribes to influence federal action on Boston's Big Dig highway construction project. In addition, she was accused of having embezzled money from Shuster's reelection committee when she served as its assistant treasurer.Charles R. Babcock and Eric Pianin, Ex-Aide to Rep. Shuster Indicted, Washington Post, April 10, 1998 In 1999 Eppard pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor charge of receiving improper compensation and paid a $5,000 fine.Associated Press, Former Shuster Aide, Lobbyist Plead Guilty, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, November 2, 1999 Eppard died on December 24, 2005.Altoona Mirror, Obituary, Ann M. Eppard, December 27, 2005 Retirement Shuster resigned from Congress on February 3, 2001, just a month after being sworn in for a 15th term. While he claimed health problems, he had also been forced to give up his chairmanship due to a Republican policy of a six-year term limit for committee chairs. He was succeeded by his son Bill, elected in a special election that May. After politics Shuster retired from politics, but he serves as Visiting Assistant Professor of Political Science at Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania, from which he received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree.

It was originally released in January 1968 by Columbia Records. Synopsis The first side of the original LP presented a trilogy of three related plays, presented as continuously connected tracks progressing in time. The second side presented a longer, separate play. =\\"Temporarily Humboldt County\\"= The first section runs 9 min 14 sec, and satirizes the displacement of the American Indians (David Ossman and Phil Austin), first by Spanish conquistadors, then by American frontiersmen, and finally by the US government forcing them onto a reservation, which it uses as a \\"cobalt testing range\\". The title comes from friends of the Firesign Theatre telling them that the local Indians in Humboldt County, California added \\"temporarily\\" to the name as a way of saying no one could really own the land. The section ends with a bomb explosion, followed by the sound of wind blowing. =\\"W. C.

The commune's spiritual leader, the perpetually drunk/stoned \\"Tiny Doctor Tim\\" (Proctor), is a parody of Timothy Leary. Philip Proctor's impersonation of W. C. Fields actually appeared on the first track, dedicating the cobalt testing range; this track title parodies the Beatles song \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\". =\\"Le Trente-Huit Cunegonde\\"= This 7 min 19 sec track segues into a future world in which the 1960s hippie counterculture has now replaced the mainstream cultural establishment. Police (Proctor and Bergman) patrol searching for \\"non-groovy\\" people not in possession of drugs, such as a grandmother (Austin) whom they arrest to be \\"returned for re- grooving\\". A teenager named Malcolm X John Lennon (Austin) is still being breast-fed by his mother (Proctor), and gets in trouble with his school principal (Proctor) for studying instead of hanging out and \\"relating\\" with his peers by smoking marijuana.

Kennedy (Proctor) chairs a committee which also returns people for re-grooving, and the \\"Secretary of Peace\\" (Ossman) directs bomber aircraft to drop copies of Naked Lunch on Nigeria. =Side two: \\"Waiting for The Electrician or Someone Like Him\\" = This single, 17 min 48 sec track begins as a Turkish language instruction record, and immediately follows its listener on a Kafkaesque trip overseas. An unnamed innocent (Austin) is manipulated by mysterious strangers and authority figures into situations beyond his control. (In the written script, the character is called simply \\"P.\\" for Phil, a reference to Kafka's use of \\"K.\\" in The Castle.) A highlight of side two is the \\"Beat the Reaper\\" sketch, a mock game show in which the contestant (Austin) is injected with a disease and must guess what it is in order to win the antidote; if the contestant fails to self-diagnose, he is sent home with the disease.

It is positioned near the open cluster Messier 11 and is across. About 25 stars are visible in a telescope with a aperture. M26 spans a linear size of 22 light years across with a tidal radius of , and is at a distance of 5,160 light years from the Earth. The brightest star is of magnitude 11 and the age of this cluster has been calculated to be 85.3 million years. It includes one known spectroscopic binary system. An interesting feature of M26 is a region of low star density near the nucleus. A hypothesis was that it was caused by an obscuring cloud of interstellar matter between us and the cluster, but a paper by James Cuffey suggested that this is not possible and that it really is a \\"shell of low stellar space density\\". In 2015, Michael Merrifield of the University of Nottingham said that there is, as yet, no clear explanation for the phenomenon.

View over Alba in the distance from Rodello's hilltop. Alba (; ) is a town and comune of Piedmont, Italy, in the province of Cuneo. It is considered the capital of the UNESCO Human Heritage hilly area of Langhe, and is famous for its white truffle and wine production. The confectionery group Ferrero is based there. The city joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in October 2017.  History  :For the ecclesiastical history, see Roman Catholic Diocese of Alba Pompeia Alba's origins date from before the Roman civilization, connected probably to the presence of Celtic and Ligurian tribes in the area. The modern town occupies the site of ancient Alba Pompeia, the name given after being officially recognized as a town by the Roman consul Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo while constructing a road from Aquae Statiellae (Acqui) to Augusta Taurinorum (Turin). Alba was the birthplace of Publius Helvius Pertinax, briefly Roman emperor in 193. After the fall of the Western Empire, the city was repeatedly sacked by Ostrogoths, Burgundians, Byzantines, Lombards, Franks, Hungarians and Saracens. In the 11th century it became a free commune (or city-state) and was a member of the Lombard League. Montferrat and the Visconti fought over the town; later it became a possession of the Gonzaga. Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy conquered it twice, while later France and Spain battled for its possession. The Treaty of Cherasco (1631) assigned Alba definitively to Savoy. During Napoleonic Wars, it was part of the Republic of Alba (1796) and of the Subalpine Republic, both French clients, before being annexed to the French Empire in 1802. It was an arrondissement center in firstly Tanaro department between 1802-1805, later in Stura one between 1805-1814 before liberation by Austrian troops. It was returned to Kingdom of Sardinia (Duchy of Savoy's name after gaining Sardinia in 1720) in 1814. Alba won a Gold Medal for Military Valour for the heroic activity of its citizens in the Italian resistance movement during the course of World War II. On 10 October 1944, the town was liberated by partisans who established a Republic of Alba which for a few weeks was able to maintain its independence from the Fascist Republic of Sal√≤. The republic lasted to 2 November 1944, when Republic of Salo retook it. It was finally liberated by French troops on 2 May 1945. Geography Approximately located at about 50 km from the cities of Turin and Cuneo, Alba is placed on the right side of the river Tanaro. The climate is typically more drought than in other lands at the north of the Po river.  Main sights  Of the Roman city, which had a polygonal form, parts of the fortified gate and remains of some edifices with marble and mosaics can still be seen. Other attractions include: *Palazzo Comunale (13th century): city hall housing a Nativity (1501) by Macrino d'Alba; adjacent is the Bishop's Palace. *City towers (14th and 15th centuries): Alba was once known as the \\"City with hundred towers\\". *Duomo of San Lorenzo (12th-century): Roman Catholic cathedral built in Romanesque style, probably atop an Ancient Roman temple. It was restructured multiple times over the centuries, starting in the 15th century in a reconstruction patronized by bishop Andrea Novelli. The current appearance derives from a controversial 19th-century restoration; however, the three portals and the crypt remain from the original edifice. The church is well known for its wood- carved choir made in 1512 by Bernardino Fossati. The current belfry, from the 12th century, includes entirely the original bell tower. *San Domenico (13th-14th centuries): Gothic architecture church housing much of the most salient sacred artworks in town. It has a noteworthy portal with a triple arch within a pointed arch, a polygonal apse and traces of Renaissance frescoes. During the Napoleonic Wars it was used a stable, but reconsecrated on 22 June 1827. *St John the Baptist (San Giovanni Battista): Baroque architecture church housing a Madonna of the Graces (1377) by Barnaba da Modena and a Madonna with Saints (1508) by Macrino d'Alba. *Santa Maria Maddalena (late-18th century): small late-Baroque church designed by Bernardo Antonio Vittone and housing the relics of Blessed Margaret of Savoy. The city museums include the Federico Eusebio Civic Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences.  Economy  In addition to traditional agriculture, Alba is a very important center of wine. In the area of Alba, in fact, there are 290 wineries that cultivate an area of of land, producing an average of 61,200 hL of wine annually.VinoStore.it The wines of Alba are among the most renowned in Italy and are divided into: * DOC: Barbera, Dolcetto, Nebbiolo. * DOCG: Barbaresco, Barolo, Moscato. The city has a thriving economy, boasting the confectionery industry's world-renowned Ferrero, the publishing house Societ√† San Paolo and the textile firm Miroglio. The town also houses the largest cooperative credit bank of Italy, by number of partners, the Banca d'Alba, and the international food chain Eataly. UniEuro, the Italian chain of stores specializing in household electrical appliances and acquired by Dixons Retail in 2002, was also established in Alba.

In the sky it is less than a degree to the northwest of the 3rd magnitude star Kaus Borealis.

It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764, and can be seen from Earth by using binoculars. The star cluster is situated in the highly crowded area of Milky Way near Gamma Cygni, at a distance of 7,200 (most sources including Mallas/Kreimer and Burnham, and agreeing with early estimates or R.J. Trumpler 1930) or 4,000 light years (the latter from Kenneth Glyn Jones and the Sky Catalogue 2000.0). The Night Sky Observer's Guide by Kepple and Sanner gives a deviating value of 6,000 light years ‚Äì the uncertainty due to poorly known absorption of the cluster's light. According to the Sky Catalog 2000, Messier 29 is included in the Cygnus OB1 association, and is approaching us at 28 km/s. Its age is estimated at 10 million years, as its five hottest stars are all giants of spectral class B0. The Night Sky Observer's Guide gives the apparent brightness of the brightest star as 8.59 visual magnitudes. The absolute magnitude may be an impressive -8.2 mag, or a luminosity of 160,000 Suns. The linear diameter was estimated at only 11 light years. Its Trumpler class is III,3,p,n (as it is associated with nebulosity), although G√∂tz gives, differently, II,3,m, and Kepple/Sanner gives I,2,m,n. The Sky Catalogue 2000.0 lists it with 50 member stars; earlier Becvar gave only the number of 20 members. This cluster can be seen in binoculars. In telescopes, lowest powers are best. The brightest stars of Messier 29 form a \\"stubby dipper\\", as Mallas says it. The four brightest stars form a quadrilateral, and another three, a triangle north of them. It is often known as the \\"cooling tower\\" due to its resemblance to the hyperboloid-shaped structures. A few fainter stars are around them, but the cluster appears quite isolated, especially in smaller telescopes. In photographs, many faint Milky Way background stars appear. Messier 29 can be found quite easily as it is about 1.7 degrees south and a little east of Gamma or 37 Cygni (Sadr). In the vicinity of Messier 29, there is some diffuse nebulosity which can be detected in photographs.

It consists of approximately 500 students and 80 faculty members, some of whom are practicing architects. It is based in the quarter- mile long () former Santa Fe Freight Depot in the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles, and offers community events such as outreach programs, free exhibitions, and public lectures.  History  SCI-Arc was founded in 1972 in Santa Monica by a group of faculty and students from Department of Architecture at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, who wanted to approach the subject from a more experimental perspective than traditional schools offered. Originally called the New School, SCI-Arc was based on the concept of a \\"college without walls\\" and it remains one of the few independent architecture schools in the world. Initially, instead of academic hierarchies the School favored a horizontal relationship between professors and students, who took responsibility for their own course of study.

Although SCI-Arc was once unaccredited and its finances unstable‚ÄîMoss joked, \\"We used to be considered one step ahead of the IRS, one step ahead of creditors\\"‚Äîthe school is now fully accredited, and its finances improved to the point that SCI-Arc was able to pay $23.1 million to buy its campus building in 2011. \\"The main thing is to figure out a way for SCI-Arc to keep growing without losing its character and pedigree,\\" D√≠az Alonso said in an interview following his appointment as Director.  Downtown Los Angeles campus  North End of SCI-Arc from Santa Fe Ave The open nature of SCI-Arc's program is reflected in the series of industrial buildings that have housed the school, where students are encouraged to design and construct their own studio environments, and occasionally full-scale projects. The school has been based in three locations‚Äîthe first (1972-1992) a small industrial building in Santa Monica and later moved into the second, a much larger (architecturally unique concrete post & beam) industrial building (1992-2000) in Marina del Rey. In 2001, it moved to its current home, the 60,000-square-foot 1907 Santa Fe Freight Depot designed by Harrison Albright on the eastern edge of Downtown Los Angeles. When SCI-Arc arrived, the building was a stripped-down concrete shell. Today the building is on the National Register of Historic Places and the school has become an anchor for the city's Arts District. The school conducts design projects that engage with under-served members of the community. To these ends, SCI-Arc has been awarded a $400,000 grant by ArtPlace to develop two on-campus public performance/lecture spaces, as well as development for a third public venue in the surrounding arts district. Across the street, \\"One Santa Fe,\\" a 438-unit apartment complex designed by Michael Maltzan Architecture (MMA) opened in 2014.  School culture  Normal scene during SCI-Arc's finals weeks SCI-Arc attracts students from nearby and throughout the world in pursuit of the educational programs that the school offers. Most students have already completed some college level work; some already hold professional architectural degrees. SCI-Arc is serious about educating and challenging its students‚Äîbut does it so in an unconventional atmosphere. It is not uncommon to see a student using his or her skateboard to get from one end of the building to the other, or to be working on a model with his or her dog napping nearby. Students actively engage in preparing the SCI-Arc Gallery exhibitions, help fellow graduating students in setting up their models for thesis presentations, and contribute to workshops that result in projects throughout the school, such as the graduation pavilion and other unique structures. Students have access to their SCI-Arc studio spaces 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Academics  SCI-Arc offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), including a five-year Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) program, a 3-year Master of Architecture (M.Arch 1) open to applicants who hold a bachelor's degree or equivalent in any field of study, and a 2-year Master of Architecture (M.Arch 2) open to applicants with a prior undergraduate degree in architecture. In the fall and spring terms, design studios, seminars and workshops led by SCI-Arc faculty and visiting instructors offer students a multitude of choices and perspectives. During the summer term, some courses are also open to upper- level students from other architecture programs and to the public. Summer at SCI-Arc features two intro to architecture programs open to the public: Design Immersion Days, a four-week intense design and architecture workshop for high school students, and MAKING+MEANING, a four-week foundation program in architecture that introduces the principles of architecture in a hands-on exploration of spatial experimentation, design methodologies and the creative process. In addition to its undergraduate and graduate programs, SCI-Arc offers four one-year postgraduate programs in fields including architectural technologies, entertainment and fiction, design of cities, and theory and pedagogy. SCI-Arc's undergraduate and graduate programs culminate in two public events in which students present their thesis projects to renowned critics from around the world, including Peter Cook, Greg Lynn, and Pritzker Prize recipient Thom Mayne. \\"SCI-Arc has long been one of this country‚Äôs best experimental labs in which designers speculate about the future of the human- made environment, and its thesis projects are its calling cards.\\"  Public programs  SCI-Arc's public programs invite the community into the school to foster debate and understanding of architecture's capacity to transform the world. A recent program and exhibition, \\"LA in Wien/Wien in LA,\\" investigated the architecture of Los Angeles and Vienna and their respective influences on one another in over the last century. It brought together six esteemed international architects‚ÄîHitoshi Abe, Peter Cook, Eric Owen Moss, Thom Mayne, Peter Noever, and Wolf Prix of Coop Himmelb(l)au‚Äîto share their perspectives and experiences in a discussion led by Anthony Vidler. The full scope of SCI- Arc public programs includes lectures, exhibitions, faculty talks and other opportunities for interaction between the school and the community.  Lecture series  Each semester's lecture series produces an eclectic selection of speakers from multiple disciplines, including architects, artists, film- makers, engineers, theoreticians, and performers. Speakers are selected by a forum of students, faculty, alumni, and administrators and the lectures are free and open to the public. Lectures are followed by a dinner in honor of the speaker, allowing students and faculty to interact more personally with the invited speaker. SCI-Arc lectures are broadcast for live viewing on the internet.  SCI-Arc Robot House  SCI-Arc's Robot House, initiated by faculty members Peter Testa and Devyn Weiser, builds upon the school's strengths to create a next generation platform for experimentation and speculation on the future of architecture. Situated conceptually and physically between studio and shop, academy and industry, the lab focuses on multi-robot cooperation and collaboration using six state-of-the-art Sta√ºbli robotic systems. The Robot House offers a new design interface extending beyond a production facility. It creates unprecedented emulation, simulation and animation environments in which computational geometry, material agency and fabrication logistics merge. The introduction of video, vision and sensing technologies with the lab's robotic systems support feedback and exchanges between matter, data and form. Projects explore additive free-form fabrication tied to advanced composite materials. The robots themselves, relatively small in size and dexterity, support a reconfigurable 3D workspace with a wide range of applications including on-site construction.

It was discovered by the French astronomer Charles Messier in 1764, who described it as a circular nebula without a star. In the New General Catalogue, compiled during the 1880s, it was described as a \\"remarkable globular, bright, large, slightly oval.\\" This cluster can be easily viewed with a pair of 10√ó50 binoculars, forming a patch of hazy light some 4 arcminutes wide that is slightly elongated along the east‚Äìwest axis. With a larger instrument, individual stars can be resolved and the cluster will cover an angle of up to 12 arcminutes across with a compressed core one arcminute wide. It is best observed around August. M30 is located at a distance of about 27,100 light-years from Earth, and is about 93 light-years across. The estimated age is roughly 12.93 billion years and it has a combined mass of about 160,000 times the mass of the Sun. The cluster is following a retrograde orbit through the inner galactic halo, suggesting that it was acquired from a satellite galaxy rather than forming within the Milky Way. It is currently located at a distance of about from the center of the galaxy, compared to an estimated for the Sun. The M30 cluster has passed through a dynamic process called core collapse and now has a concentration of mass at its core of about a million times the Sun's mass per cubic parsec. This makes it one of the highest density regions in the Milky Way galaxy. Stars in such close proximity will experience a high rate of interactions that can create binary star systems, as well as a type of star called a blue straggler that is formed by mass transfer. A process of mass segregation may have caused the central region to gain a greater proportion of higher mass stars, creating a color gradient with increasing blueness toward the middle of the cluster.

The complex opened on March 22, 1975, and has been expanded and renamed over the years. In 2013 plans were announced for a three-year renovation and expansion of the complex, and on September 29, 2015, the name officially changed to Disney Springs. The 120-acre complex includes four distinct areas: Marketplace, The Landing, Town Center, and West Side. Buses and water taxis operated by Disney Transport provide transportation between Disney Springs and other areas of Walt Disney World. History =Early expansion; multiple rebrandings= Aerial view of Disney Springs as of May 8, 2016 Characters in Flight observation balloon ride The Lake Buena Vista Shopping Village, which opened on March 22, 1975, was originally envisioned as an area shopping mall. Two years after its opening, the complex was renamed Walt Disney World Village. With the advent of new management under Michael Eisner in 1984, Disney began looking for ways to keep vacationers on Walt Disney World property longer, and prevent them from leaving for entertainment beyond Disney's borders. To compete with the popular Church Street Station clubs in downtown Orlando, Disney announced the addition of Pleasure Island, featuring nightclubs showcasing Disney's quality and creativity, to Walt Disney World Village on July 21, 1986. Construction began the following August and Pleasure Island was opened on May 1, 1989, the same day as the Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park. Later that year, the complex was renamed Disney Village Marketplace. In the mid-1990s, the growth of Walt Disney World created the potential for further expansion, leading to a $1 billion investment in projects across the resort. The first World of Disney store opened October 2, 1996, in Marketplace.Smith, Dave. Page 620. Disney A to Z - The Updated Official Encyclopedia. 1998. Retrieved from On June 20, 1995, major enhancements and expansions were announced for the area, with the Disney Village Marketplace and Pleasure Island being combined into a newly branded district named Downtown Disney. The re-branding was introduced on September 7, 1997. On September 15, Downtown Disney West Side, a expansion, opened as a third shopping, dining, and entertainment area featuring venues such as La Nouba (the former Cirque Du Soleil show in residence which closed at the end of 2017), DisneyQuest, and Virgin Megastore. Major changes to the complex also included the conversion of Mickey's Character Shop into the World of Disney, becoming the world's largest Disney store, in addition to the expansion and upgrade of the AMC Pleasure Island Theatres, as well as the opening of Rainforest Cafe and Planet Hollywood. On September 27, 2008, the Pleasure Island nightclubs closed. The Downtown Disney complex gained a sister district in California on January 12, 2001, with the addition of Downtown Disney at the Disneyland Resort. Similar complexes also exist at other Disney resorts: Disney Village, which opened on April 12, 1992, at Disneyland Resort Paris; Ikspiari, which opened on July 7, 2000, at the Tokyo Disney Resort; and Disneytown at Shanghai Disney Resort. =Renovation, expansion, and renaming= The Springs of Disney Springs - Town Center (from The Landing). Welcome Center in gabled building on left. On March 14, 2013, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts chairman Tom Staggs announced that Downtown Disney would be redesigned and renamed as Disney Springs. The 3-year renovation and expansion project would include 150 new tenants, two parking structures, and a near- doubling of mall area. Prior to this announcement, the last renovation of Downtown Disney had been in 1997. In order to facilitate the construction of the area and the increase in capacity, two large parking structures were constructed in previous surface parking lot areas. New construction features include new bridges connecting the complex to Disney's Saratoga Springs resort, with further bridges connecting The Landing to the Marketplace, The Springs, Town Center and West Side. High Line structures were built across the West Side in order to provide both theme and shade. In addition, a new bus terminal, with dedicated bus lanes on Buena Vista Drive, was built; Buena Vista Drive was widened, and a new exit ramp built from Interstate 4 directly to Disney Springs, as part of the traffic upgrade. The complex was renamed Disney Springs on September 29, 2015. Town Center, built just south of The Landing in the surface parking lots, was opened on May 15, 2016, completing the major construction on the project. On March 17, 2020, Disney Springs was closed until at least the end of March 2020 due to the coronavirus epidemic. It was also announced that the Disney Springs NBA Experience and NBA Store would be temporarily closed as well. Disney reported that it remains to be seen if some restaurants and retail stores \\"may remain open.\\" However, these facilities are not owned by Disney Springs or Disney. By April 3, Disney Springs and other Disney theme parks still remained closed.https://www.disneysprings.com/ On May 7, 2020, it was announced that Disney Springs will begin a phased reopening on May 20. Areas Disney Springs is divided into four areas: Marketplace, The Landing, Town Center, and West Side. The complex is bordered by Lake Buena Vista to the north and the parking garages and surface lots to the south. Walt Disney Imagineering took inspiration for Disney Springs from real coastal towns found throughout Florida, such as St. Augustine and Coral Gables. Creative director Dave Hoffman said about the area, \\"Each neighborhood reflects its function and [the fictional] time period when it was developed.\\" According to the town's fictional history, Disney Springs was settled in the mid-1800s by a cattle rancher who discovered the town's namesake springs and the town subsequently expanded from the springs outwards.

The first restaurant in the Earl of Sandwich chain is located here. T-Rex Cafe is a dinosaur-themed restaurant operated by Landry's Restaurants, which features animatronic dinosaurs. It opened on October 14, 2008. Landry's Restaurants also operates Rainforest Cafe at this location. A walkway spanning the Village Lake and connecting Rainforest Cafe with the Lego Store‚ÄîThe Marketplace Causeway‚Äîwas constructed and opened in 2015. =The Landing= The Landing depicts the fictional town's transportation hub and marina. The Landing features nautical-themed restaurants and shops, including Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar‚Äîan aviation-themed dive bar based on the character from the Indiana Jones films‚Äîand The Boathouse, which serves as the port for the amphibious automobiles that offer cruises of Lake Buena Vista. The Landing was in the site of Pleasure Island, a nighttime entertainment district with two comedy clubs and four dance clubs. These areas closed permanently on September 27, 2008. On November 18, 2010, Disney announced a project named Hyperion Wharf, which was planned to replace the Pleasure Island complex. Pleasure Island would have undergone extensive renovations and re-theming to transform into the early twentieth century wharf-themed entertainment area. New shopping and dining locations would have also been added. In July 2011, it was announced that these plans were delayed. The plans were later canceled because it was deemed better to totally overhaul the Downtown Disney area. With the advent of Disney Springs, the former Pleasure Island was redesigned as The Landing in 2015. The Empress Lilly The former Empress Lilly, now the Paddlefish restaurant The structure originally known as the Empress Lilly is a static full-size replica of a paddle steamer riverboat on Village Lake. It is 220 feet long and 62 feet wide. Though it resembles a paddle steamer boat, it is actually a boat-shaped building on a submerged concrete foundation. It opened on May 1, 1976, when it was christened by Walt Disney's widow, Lillian Disney, for whom it was named. It originally housed four separate entertainment and dining areas. In the mid-1990s, Levy Restaurants signed a contract to operate the \\"ship\\" for 20 years. On April 22, 1995, the Empress Lilly closed. All interiors were ripped out and the old smokestacks and paddlewheel were removed because they had rusted and rotted; these were not replaced. The restaurant opened as Fulton's Crab House on March 10, 1996. Fulton's Crab House closed for major renovations in 2016 to be remodeled into a new restaurant, Paddlefish. As part of the renovation, the exterior was altered greatly, while retaining the original shape of the ship, and new smokestacks and paddlewheels were installed. =Town Center= Town Center depicts the fictional town's central business district, featuring Spanish Revival architecture from the 1920s. The Town Center area also features the namesake \\"springs\\", which are artificial. The area debuted in 2016, having been built on former surface parking lots, and features many well known retailers. The area will open in multiple phases, with the first phase having opened on May 15, 2016. Retailers to have opened in the first phase of Town Center include Anthropologie, Uniqlo (the first of its kind in the Southeastern United States), Sephora, L'Occitane en Provence, Pandora, UGG, Johnston & Murphy, ZARA and Kate Spade and Trophy Room among many others. =West Side= West Side depicts the town's exposition center, having been developed in the 1950s, according to the town's fictional history. The expansion of the existing AMC Theatres Pleasure Island 24 venue opened with Downtown Disney West Side in 1997. Renovations began in late 2010, which created theaters offering food service. The complex was renamed AMC Downtown Disney 24. In 1997, there were plans to open a Planet Movies by AMC entertainment complex at this location by combining the Planet Hollywood restaurant with a re-branded AMC megaplex. These plans were abandoned due to Planet Hollywood's continued financial problems. The complex has now been renamed AMC Disney Springs 24. DisneyQuest was located in this area until it closed on July 2, 2017, and subsequently demolished. The NBA Experience, which was built on the DisneyQuest site, opened on August 12, 2019.  Incidents  * On December 25, 2015, a fight broke out at Bongo's Cuban Cafe between a 70-year-old man and restaurant staff. The man was escorted out of the restaurant after he grabbed a worker's bicep, which left a mark. The man was arrested a short time later outside Starbucks Coffee. At some point during the fight, someone falsely reported hearing gunshots at the restaurant. This rumor spread quickly, leading to mass panic. The suspect was found without a weapon and was charged with battery.

It opened on January 12, 2001; a component of the Disneyland Resort expansion project alongside the Disney California Adventure theme park and Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa. Location and history Downtown Disney connects the two Disneyland Resort theme parks with its three resort hotels, running from the western side of the property's Esplanade to the Disneyland Hotel. West Street, which bordered Disneyland's western side, was rechristened Disneyland Drive and lowered to accommodate a pedestrian bridge that connects much of Downtown Disney to the Disneyland Hotel and Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel. A Disneyland Monorail System station sits adjacent to the pedestrian bridge. The area has featured several shops and restaurants, ranging from popular retail brands to many Disney-operated shops including a World of Disney store running beneath much of the Grand California Hotel. Downtown Disney has featured as many as 30 shops, but there have been changes due to announcements in late 2017.https://wdwinfo.com/news-stories/more-changes- coming-to-downtown-disney-in-2018 In July 2019, parking for Downtown Disney was relocated to south of the Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel (Simba parking lot). In addition, a pedestrian bridge linking the Pixar Pals and Mickey and Friends parking structures to the shopping district was opened on September 13, 2019. = Canceled Fourth Hotel = In 2017, plans were announced for a fourth resort hotel at the property. Situated in front of the Disneyland Hotel, the new hotel would displace much of the westernmost portion of Downtown Disney and would have featured 700 rooms. The cost of construction for the hotel would have been offset by up to $267 million in tax rebates over 20 years, allowing the resort to keep a percentage of the transient occupancy tax levied on Anaheim hotels. In Summer of 2018, several large Downtown Disney tenants closed in preparation for the new hotel's construction - an AMC Theatres cinema, Rainforest Cafe and ESPN Zone restaurants, and smaller tenants including Earl of Sandwich and a Starbucks location. Weeks after the closures took place, growing tensions between Disney and the City of Anaheim over the subsidy and the hotel's location led to the project being put on hold. Days after the announcement that the project was postponed, Disneyland requested that the tax subsidies be rescinded. The Anaheim City Council voted to rescind the tax subsidies days later. After weeks of inactivity at the hotel's proposed site, Disney announced in October 2018 that the fourth hotel project had been canceled. In October 2018, Earl of Sandwich and Starbucks reopened. As of July 2020, the hotel's proposed site remains abandoned.

In October 2012, the museum was rebranded as the China Art Museum when it moved to the China pavilion at Expo 2010 on the former Shanghai Expo 2010 lands. The Shanghai Art Museum building is the former clubhouse building of the Shanghai Race Club.The Shanghai Race Club. It sits on the western edge of People's Park, north of People's Square, which was once the Shanghai race course. The Shanghai Art Museum was the original home of the Shanghai Biennale, founded in 1996 by Fang Zengxian, then director of the museum. The former museum building is being converted to house the Shanghai History Museum, which had been left without a home due to redevelopment since 1999. History of the Shanghai Art Museum building The Shanghai Art Museum building is located on the south side of Nanjing Road (West). The building has an area of 2,200 sq m. The building was constructed in 1933, as the clubhouse for the Shanghai Race Club race course. The horse race course was reputed to be the third most profitable industry during the 1930s (during the Republic of China era). In 1955, the building was renovated and a terrace was constructed on the roof. The goal was mainly to enable the architects to build wider stairs leading to the clock tower, so that youth can easily visit the tower. The building has one of the most prominent clock towers in the city after the Customs House clock tower on the Bund. The clock tower at the Art Museum has historically been associated with decay and corruption in the city, as it was often inaccurate. However, it was renovated in 2006 and has been accurate since then. Events Shanghai Art Museum was the home to the Shanghai Biennale, which started from 1996. The Shanghai Biennale is considered one of the most important cultural events in Shanghai. In 2012, the Shanghai Biennale moved to the new Power Station of Art.

In common use, \\"cane\\" may refer to any plant with a long, thin stem. However, the cane used for furniture is derived from the rattan vine native to Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia. The vines typically grow to 100‚Äì300 ft in length; most have a diameter less than 1 in. Before export, the rattan stems are cut to uniform lengths and the bark is removed in narrow strips of to in. Sugar cane and bamboo (sometimes called \\"cane\\" in the southern United States) should not be confused with rattan cane. Rattan vine looks somewhat similar to bamboo but is quite different in that bamboo is hollow and holds itself upright while rattan is a solid flexible vine that needs the support of surrounding structure to elevate itself off the forest floor. It climbs to the top of canopies of the forest to reach sunlight with the help of large rugged thorns that grab hold of surrounding trees. Sometimes much of the length of these rugged vines are draped along the forest floor from tree to tree in search of a suitable structure to climb. Mistakenly some people confuse furniture or chair caning with wicker. To clarify, chair caning is specifically the craft of applying rattan cane or rattan peel to a piece of furniture such as the backs or seats of chairs, whereas wicker or wicker work is a reference to the craft of weaving any number of materials such as willow or rattan reeds as well as man made paper based cords.

M32 is a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and was discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749. M32 measures 6.5 ¬± 0.2 thousand light-years in diameter at the widest point.Diameter = distance √ó sin(diameter_angle) = 6.5 ¬± 0.2 thousand light-years. diameter The galaxy is a prototype of the relatively rare, compact elliptical (cE) galaxy class. Half the stars concentrate within an effective radius of only 100 parsecs. Densities in the central stellar cusp increase steeply, exceeding 3√ó107 M‚äô pc‚àí3 at the smallest radii resolved by HST, and the half-light radius of this central star cluster is around 6 parsec.Graham, A.W. and Spitler, L.R., Quantifying the coexistence of massive black holes and dense nuclear star clusters Like more ordinary elliptical galaxies, M32 contains mostly older faint red and yellow stars with practically no dust or gas and consequently no current star formation. It does, however, show hints of star formation in the relatively recent past. In this image of the Andromeda Galaxy, Messier 32 is to the left of the center. Origins The structure and stellar content of M32 are difficult to explain by traditional galaxy formation models. Theoretical arguments and some simulations suggest a scenario in which the strong tidal field of M31 can transform a spiral galaxy or a lenticular galaxy into a compact elliptical. As a small disk galaxy falls into the central parts of M31, much of its outer layers will be stripped away. The central bulge of the small galaxy is much less affected and retains its morphology. Gravitational tidal effects may also drive gas inward and trigger a star burst in the core of the small galaxy, resulting in the high density of M32 observed today. There is evidence that M32 has a faint outer disk, and as such is not a typical elliptical galaxy. Newer simulations find that an off-centre impact by M32 around 800 million years ago explains the present-day warp in M31's disk. However this feature only occurs during the first orbital passage, whereas it takes many orbits for tides to transform a normal dwarf into M32. The observed colours and stellar populations of M32's outskirts do not match the stellar halo of M31, indicating that tidal losses from M32 are not their source. Taken together, these circumstances may suggest that M32 already began in its compact state, and has retained most of its own stars. At least one similar cE galaxy has been discovered in isolation, without any massive companion to thresh it. Another hypothesis is that M32 would be in fact the largest remnant of a former spiral galaxy, M32p, which was then the third largest member of the Local Group. According to this simulation, M31 (Andromeda) and M32p merged about two billion years ago, which could explain both the unusual makeup of the current M31 stellar halo, and the structure and content of M32. Distance measurements At least two techniques have been used to measure distances to M32. The infrared surface brightness fluctuations distance measurement technique estimates distances to spiral galaxies based on the graininess of the appearance of their bulges. The distance measured to M32 using this technique is 2.46 ¬± 0.09 million light-years (755 ¬± 28 kpc). However, M32 is close enough that the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method may be used to estimate its distance. The estimated distance to M32 using this technique is 2.51 ¬± 0.13 million light-years (770 ¬± 40 kpc). For several additional reasons, M32 is thought to be in the foreground of M31, rather than behind. Its stars and planetary nebulae do not appear obscured or reddened by foreground gas or dust. Gravitational microlensing of M31 by a star in M32 was observed in one event. Black hole M32 contains a supermassive black hole.

He was worshiped from the early Old Kingdom period.Pat Remler: Egyptian Mythology, A to Z. Chelsea House, New York 2010, , p. 177-178.  Description  Shesmu was seldom depicted but when he was he appeared as a man with a lion's head holding a butcher's knife. In later times he appeared as a lion. If only his name was mentioned it often appeared with the determinative of an oil press, and sometimes only the oilpress was depicted.Hans Bonnet: Reallexikon der √§gyptischen Religionsgeschichte. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 2000, , p. 679.  Worship  Shesmu was a god with a contradictory personality. On one hand, he was lord of perfume, maker of all precious oil, lord of the oil press, lord of ointments and lord of wine. He was a celebration deity, like the goddess Meret. Old Kingdom texts mention a special feast celebrated for Shesmu: young men would press grapes with their feet and then dance and sing for Shesmu. On the other hand, Shesmu was very vindictive and bloodthirsty. He was also lord of blood, great slaughterer of the gods, and he who dismembers bodies. In Old Kingdom Pyramid Texts, several prayers ask Shesmu to dismember and cook certain deities in an attempt to give the food to a deceased king. The deceased king needed the divine powers to survive the dangerous journey to the stars.George Hart: The Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses. Routledge, London/New York 2005, , pp. 146-147. Shesmu present offerings However, the interpretation remains open if the word \\"blood\\" is to be taken literally, as the ancient Egyptians symbolically offered red wine as \\"the blood of the gods\\" to several deities. This association was based simply on the dark red color of the wine, a circumstance that lead to connections of Shesmu with other deities who could appear in red colors. Examples include deities such as Ra, Horus, and Kherty. The violent character of Shesmu made him a protector among the companions of Ra's nocturnal barque. Shesmu protected Ra by threatening the demons and brawling with them. In the Pyramid Texts, he does similar things. It appears that starting in the New Kingdom, Shesmu's negative attributes became gradually overshadowed by the positive ones, although on a 21st Dynasty papyri his wine press appears to be filled with human heads in place of grapes (a depiction which was common earlier, on Middle Kingdom Coffin Texts). Then later, on the 26th Dynasty sarcophagus of the Divine Adoratrice Ankhnesneferibre, Shesmu is recorded as a fine oil maker for the god Ra. And even later, during the Greco-Roman period, the manufacture of the finest oils and perfumes for the gods became Shesmu's primary role.  Cult  Shesmu's main cult center was located at the Fayum. Later, there were further shrines erected at Edfu and Dendera.

TransUnion collects and aggregates information on over one billion individual consumers in over thirty countries including \\"200 million files profiling nearly every credit-active consumer in the United States\\". Its customers include over 65,000 businesses. Based in Chicago, Illinois, TransUnion's 2014 revenue was US$1.3 billion. It is the smallest of the three largest credit agencies, along with Experian and Equifax (known as the \\"Big Three\\"). TransUnion also markets credit reports and other credit and fraud-protection products directly to consumers. Like all credit reporting agencies, the company is required by U.S. law to provide consumers with one free credit report every year. History TransUnion was originally formed in 1968 as a holding company for the railroad leasing organization, Union Tank Car Company. The following year, it acquired the Credit Bureau of Cook County, which possessed and maintained 3.6 million credit accounts. In 1981, a Chicago-based holding company, The Marmon Group, acquired TransUnion for approximately $688 million.Marmon Group In 2010, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Advent International acquired it from Madison Dearborn Partners In 2014, TransUnion acquired Hank Asher's data company TLO. On June 25, 2015, TransUnion became a publicly traded company for the first time, trading under the symbol TRU. TransUnion eventually began to offer products and services for both businesses and consumers. For businesses, TransUnion updated its traditional credit score offering to include trended data that helps predict consumer repayment and debt behavior. This product, referred to as CreditVision, launched in October 2013. Its SmartMove‚Ñ¢ service facilitates credit and background checks for consumers who work as landlords. In September 2013, the company acquired eScan Data Systems of Austin, Texas, to provide post-service eligibility determination support to hospitals and healthcare systems. The technology was integrated into TransUnion's ClearIQ platform, which tracks patients demographic and insurance related information to support benefit verification. In November 2013, TransUnion acquired TLO LLC, a company that leverages data in support of its investigative and risk management tools. Its TLOxp technology aggregates data sets and uses a proprietary algorithm to uncover relationships between data. In 2014, a TransUnion analysis found that reporting rental payment information to credit bureaus can positively affect credit scores. As a result, TransUnion initiated a service called ResidentCredit, making it easy for property owners to report data about their tenants on a monthly basis. These reports include the amount each tenant pays, the timeliness of their last payment, and any remaining balance the tenant currently owes. As a result, some companies have started reporting rent payment information to TransUnion. In 2015, TransUnion acquired Trustev, a digital verification company specializing in online fraud for $21 million, minus debts. As part of its fraud protection products, it also offers business a tool called DecisionEdge that aggregates the data needed to prevent fraud through a system that customizes the information needed to finalize a transaction. For consumers, TransUnion offers credit monitoring and identity theft protection tools. The company's app offers a function called CreditLock that allows an individual to unlock and lock their credit to help protect against fraudulent activity. In 2017, TransUnion acquired FactorTrust, a consumer reporting agency specializing in alternative credit data. In mid- April 2018, TransUnion announced it intended to buy UK-based CallCredit Information Group for $1.4 billion, subject to regulatory approval. In August 2020, TransUnion is teaming up with Signal, a communications firm headquartered in Chicago, to improve its capabilities. Signal 's purchase reflects a further commitment by TransUnion to develop leadership in person- based, identity-enabled marketing strategies following its TruSignal acquisition in 2019 and Tru Optik investment. Legal and regulatory issues In 2003, Judy Thomas of Klamath Falls, Oregon, was awarded $5.3 million in a successful lawsuit against TransUnion. The award was made on the grounds that it took her six years to get TransUnion to remove incorrect information in her credit report.Block, Sandra. \\"Fixing errors in credit report is no small task\\", USA Today, 2005-08-27. In 2006, after spending two years trying to correct erroneous credit information that resulted from being a victim of identity theft, a fraud victim named Sloan filed suit against all three of the US's largest credit agencies. TransUnion and Experian settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. In Sloan v. Equifax, a jury awarded Sloan $351,000. \\"She wrote letters. She called them. They saw the problem. They just didn't fix it,\\" said her attorney, A. Hugo Blankingship III.Baldas, Tresa. \\"Consumer Lawsuits Against Credit Bureaus Are Multiplying\\", The National Law Journal, 2006-08-16. TransUnion has also been criticized for concealing charges. Many users complained of not being aware of a $17.95/month charge for holding a TransUnion account. In March 2015, following a settlement with the New York Attorney-General, TransUnion, along with other credit reporting companies, Experian and Equifax, agreed to help consumers with errors and red flags on credit reports. Under the new settlement, credit-reporting firms are required to use trained employees to respond when a consumer flags a mistake on their file. These employees are responsible for communicating with the lender and resolving the dispute. In June 2017, a California jury ruled against Transunion with a $60 million verdict in the largest Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) verdict in history. The San Francisco federal court jury awarded $60 million in damages to consumers who were falsely reported on a government list of terrorists and other security threats. The plaintiffs' team of attorneys at Francis & Mailman, P.C. partnered with another California-based firm in the class action.

The technique is most associated with the twelve-tone technique, created by its 'total thematicism' where a tone-row (melody) generates all (harmonic) material. It was also used by Alexander Scriabin, though from a diametrically opposed direction, created by his use of extremely slow harmonic rhythm which eventually led to his use of unordered pitch-class sets, usually hexachords (of six pitches) as harmony from which melody may also be created. (Samson 1977) It may also be observed in Igor Stravinsky's Russian period, such as in Les Noces, derived from his use of folk melodies as generating material and influenced by shorter pieces by Claude Debussy, such as Voiles, and Modest Mussorgsky.

He was 22 years old when he died. Whelan was born in Dublin. He was one of seven children born to John and Elizabeth Whelan; his father had died in 1943, when Whelan was just eight years old. He was not a confident flyer and just before the aeroplane took off from Munich, he was heard to say: \\"This may be death, but I'm ready.\\" Club career Whelan (back row, far left) in a Manchester United team photo in 1957 Whelan began his career with Home Farm before joining Manchester United as an 18-year-old in 1953. He was capped four times for the Republic of Ireland national team, but did not score. His brother John played for Shamrock Rovers and Drumcondra F.C.. He made his first appearance for United during the 1954‚Äì55 season and quickly became a regular first team player, and went on to make 98 first-team appearances in four seasons at United, scoring 52 goals. He was United's top scorer in the 1956‚Äì57 season, scoring 26 goals in the First Division and 33 in all competitions as United won their second successive league title and reached the semi-finals of the European Cup and FA Cup. Such was the strength of the competition in the United first team that he was soon being kept out of the side by Bobby Charlton. He travelled with the United team to Belgrade for the fateful European Cup tie against Red Star Belgrade, the day before the Munich air disaster, but did not play in the game. Legacy Whelan's grave in Glasnevin Cemetery, decorated with a Manchester United scarf On 8 December 2006, the railway bridge on Fassaugh Road/Dowth Avenue junction in Cabra, Dublin 7, close to Dalymount Park was renamed in his honour. The campaign to have the bridge renamed was initiated and organised by members of the Cabra, GAA club, Naomh Fionbarra (Irish language spelling) (St. Finbarr's) and sanctioned by Dublin City Council in early 2006. It is close to St. Attracta Road, the street in which he was born. The unveiling ceremony was performed by Whelan's Manchester United teammate at the time of the aircrash, Sir Bobby Charlton.

He was born in Highfields near Doncaster in the West Riding of Yorkshire, in September 1935, one of three children born to miner William Pegg and his wife Jessie. His father also played amateur football to a high standard during the 1930s, winning a number of trophies with local football teams. He signed for United on leaving school in 1950 and made his first team debut in the Football League First Division against Middlesbrough on 6 December 1952, at the age of 17, and by the age of 20 he was a regular member of the first team. In 1956, at the age of 21, he collected a First Division title medal. The following season, he picked up another league title medal and also helped United's reach the semi-finals of the European Cup, also collecting a runners-up medal in the FA Cup. He was the club's first-choice outside left until the final few months before the disaster (when he was displaced by Albert Scanlon) and had collected two League Championship winner's medals in the two seasons leading up to the Munich air disaster. He also helped them reach the European Cup semi-finals twice. His performance against Real Madrid in the 1956-57 semi-finals reportedly inspired the Spanish giants to sign a new left-back specifically to combat Pegg's talents in the future, although his death less than a year later meant that he never played against them again. He was capped once for the England national football team, his solitary appearance coming in 1957, and was tipped by many to succeed Tom Finney, who was nearing the end of his international career, in the England team as England's regular left winger. Still only 22 years old when he died, he was one of the youngest people to die out of the 23 who lost their lives at Munich. He was born in the village of Highfields, north of Doncaster and he was buried in the nearby Redhouse Cemetery. A memorial chair was dedicated in his memory at St. George's Church in Highfields and when that church was closed the chair was moved to All Saints' Church in Woodlands which now serves both villages. Pegg's sister, Irene Beevers, contributed to a 1998 ITV documentary, The Busby Babes: End of a Dream, which commemorated the 40th anniversary of the tragedy. She, Pegg's brother and Pegg's other sister, Doreen Robinson (who now lives in Australia) visited the scene of the Munich air crash in September 2005, on what would have been his 70th birthday, to pay tribute to their brother. He was also outlived by both of his parents, though they have both since died; his father died in 1980 and his mother in 2006. They are both buried alongside him.

Equifax collects and aggregates information on over 800 million individual consumers and more than 88 million businesses worldwide. In addition to credit and demographic data and services to business, Equifax sells credit monitoring and fraud prevention services directly to consumers. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Equifax operates or has investments in 24 countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. With over 10,000 employees worldwide, Equifax has US$3.1 billion in annual revenue and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol EFX. Like all credit reporting agencies, the company is required by U.S. law to provide consumers with one free credit report every year. Equifax was the subject of more than 57,000 consumer complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from October 2012 to September 17, 2017, with most complaints relating to incomplete, inaccurate, outdated, or misattributed information held by the company. In September 2017, Equifax announced a cyber-security breach, which it claims to have occurred between mid-May and July 2017, where cybercriminals accessed approximately 145.5 million U.S. Equifax consumers' personal data, including their full names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and driver license numbers. Equifax also confirmed at least 209,000 consumers' credit card credentials were taken in the attack. On March 1, 2018, Equifax announced that 2.4 million additional U.S. customers were affected by the breach, increasing the number of affected to 147.9 million Americans. The company claims to have discovered evidence of the cybercrime event on July 29, 2017. Residents in the United Kingdom (15.2 million) and Canada (about 19,000) were also impacted. The vulnerability in which Chinese hackers leveraged was ,CVE-2017-5638 the hackers managed to stay in Equifax systems undetected for approximately 134 days. In March 2018, the Security and Exchange Commission accused Jun Ying, Equifax's former CIO, of illicit insider trading, by selling company stock before the breach was publicly disclosed. After an investigation by the FBI, Ying pleaded guilty, was sentenced to four months of prison plus a year of supervised release, and was fined $55,000.00 and ordered to pay restitution of $117,117.61 in June 2019. An Equifax manager, Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu, also pleaded guilty to insider trading and received a sentence of 8 months of home confinement. In July 2019, The New York Times, the New York Post and other media reported Equifax had agreed to pay approximately $650 million to settle with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to resolve investigations by several state attorneys general, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the FTC, and a consumer class-action lawsuit related to the data breach. By September 2019, however, Equifax had added qualifications and \\"hurdles\\" to its claims process which put in doubt whether the previously announced cash settlement of $125 per affected consumer would actually be awarded. On 19 December 2019, a federal judge in Atlanta awarded class-action attorneys representing consumers approximately $77.5 million, suggesting that individual consumers might expect to receive around six or seven dollars. History Equifax was founded by Cator and Guy Woolford in Atlanta, Georgia, as Retail Credit Company in 1899. By 1920, the company had offices throughout the United States and Canada. By the 1960s, Retail Credit Company was one of the nation's largest credit bureaus, holding files on millions of American and Canadian citizens. Even though the company continued to do credit reporting, the majority of its business was making reports to insurance companies when people applied for new insurance policies, such as life, auto, fire and medical insurance. RCC also investigated insurance claims and made employment reports when people were seeking new jobs. Most of the credit work was then being done by a subsidiary, Retailers Commercial Agency. Retail Credit Company's information holdings and willingness to sell its information attracted criticism in the 1960s and 1970s. These included that it collected \\"...facts, statistics, inaccuracies and rumors ... about virtually every phase of a person's life; his marital troubles, jobs, school history, childhood, sex life, and political activities.\\" The company was also alleged to reward its employees for collecting derogatory information on consumers.\\"Separating Equifax from fiction\\", Wired, September 1995, retrieved September 13, 2007 In 1970, after the company had computerized its records, which led to wider availability of the personal information it held, the U.S. Congress held hearings that led to the enactment of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This legislation gave consumers rights regarding information stored about them in corporate databanks. It is alleged that the hearings prompted the Retail Credit Company to change its name to Equifax in 1975 to improve its image. Equifax expanded into commercial credit reports on companies in the United States, Canada and the UK, where it came into competition with companies such as Dun & Bradstreet and Experian. The insurance reporting was phased out. The company also had a division selling specialist credit information to the insurance industry but spun off this service, including the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (CLUE) database as ChoicePoint in 1997. Equifax formerly offered digital certification services, which it sold to GeoTrust in September 2001. Also in 2001, Equifax spun off its payment services division, forming the publicly listed company Certegy, which subsequently acquired Fidelity National Information Services in 2006. Certegy effectively became a subsidiary of Fidelity National Financial as a result of this reverse acquisition merger (See Certegy and Fidelity National Information Services for further information). In October 2010, Equifax announced it was acquiring Anakam, Inc, an identity verification software company headquartered in San Diego, California, which invented and pioneered SMS (text-message based) two-factor authentication. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Equifax purchased eThority, a business intelligence (BI) company headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina, in October 2011. eThority is partnering with TALX, a St. Louis-based business unit of Equifax, and will remain in Charleston.

Credit reports provide detailed information on the personal credit and payment history of individuals, indicating how they have honored financial obligations such as paying bills or repaying a loan. Credit grantors use this information to decide what sort of products or services to offer their customers, and on what terms. Equifax also provides commercial credit reports containing financial and non-financial data on businesses of all sizes. Equifax collects and provides data through the National Consumer Telecom and Utilities Exchange (NCTUE), an exchange of non-credit data including consumer payment history on telecommunications and utility accounts. In 1999, Equifax began offering services to the credit consumer sector in addition, such as credit fraud and identity theft prevention products. Equifax and other credit monitoring agencies are required by law to provide US residents with one free credit file disclosure every 12 months; the Annualcreditreport.com website incorporates data from U.S. Equifax credit records. Equifax also offers fraud prevention products based on device fingerprinting such as \\"FraudIQ Authenticate Device.\\"  Security Failings  According to Hon. Michael Crapo, Chairman of the committee, \\"The amount of data that the private industry and Government collect and store is very concerning. There is intrinsic vulnerability in collecting and storing personal financial information, and we need to have a meaningful discussion on how to protect and limit access to it.\\" = 2016 advance-warnings of insecure systems = According to an October 2017 report from Motherboard, around December 2016, a security researcher examining Equifax's servers found that an online portal, created for Equifax employees only, was accessible to the open Internet. The same types of sensitive private information of American consumers (names, birth dates, social security numbers, etc.) were exposed as in the May‚ÄìJuly breach, according to Motherboard. Additionally, the security researchers said they were able to gain shell access on Equifax's servers and discovered and reported to Equifax additional vulnerabilities. According to the reporting, despite receiving this warning from the security researcher, the affected portal was not closed until six months later in June, well after the March and May‚ÄìJuly breaches had begun. Moreover, the employee portal was reportedly not the same server targeted in the later breaches, which Motherboard speculates may suggest multiple breaches by more than one party may have occurred. =March 2017 security breach= On September 18, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Equifax had been the victim of a \\"major breach of its computer systems\\" in March 2017, and that in early March it had begun \\"notifying a small number of outsiders and banking customers\\" about this attack.Riley, Michael, Anita Sharpe, and Jordan Robertson, \\"Equifax Suffered a Hack Almost Five Months Earlier Than the Date It Disclosed\\", Bloomberg News, September 18/19, 2017. According to Bloomberg, a person familiar with the breach believed this early-March intrusion may have been carried out by the same party that breached Equifax's computer systems again in May. According to Bloomberg, Equifax enlisted Mandiant (owned by FireEye, Inc.) to assist in investigating the March attack. The same cybersecurity firm was hired following the May‚ÄìJuly breach. =May‚ÄìJuly 2017 data breach= Between May and July 2017, yet-identified hackers were able to use a known exploit on one of Equifax' web servers that had yet to be updated to access the credit records of more than 140 million Americans as well as some British and Canadian citizens before the breach was detected and shut down. Equifax disclosed the breach on September 7, 2017 after determining the means and scope of the breach. The event was considered \\"one of the biggest data breaches in history.\\"\\"The end of the cloud is coming\\", VentureBeat, Victor Charypar, November 4, 2017 Several consumers filed lawsuits in small-claims court against Equifax due to the breach, while Equifax later came to a $575 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to offer either a cash payment or credit monitoring for those affected by the breach. The data from the breach has yet to be seen on black markets or the dark web by security experts, making it difficult to identify the origin of the breach. However, in February 2020, the United States Department of Justice indicted four members of China's People's Liberation Army on nine charges related to the breach, which China has denied. =2017 exposure of Argentine consumer data= In September 2017, Brian Krebs revealed that the Argentine arm of Equifax had left private data from approximately 14,000 consumers, and more than 100 staff members, available to anyone who entered \\"admin\\" as both the username and password for one of its online systems. =2017 withdrawal of vulnerable mobile apps= On September 7, 2017, the same day as Equifax announced a large security breach, Equifax removed its official mobile apps from the Apple App Store and from Google Play. While these apps themselves were not reportedly connected to that breach, they had security flaws of their own, being vulnerable to man-in-the- middle attacks owing to some parts using HTTP instead of HTTPS. =2017 exposure of American salary data= On October 8, 2017, Krebs reported that The Work Number, a website operated by Equifax's TALX division, exposed the salary histories for employees of tens of thousands of US companies to anyone in possession of the employee's Social Security Number and date of birth. For roughly half the US population, both of the latter pieces of data are known to be in possession of criminals, following Equifax's May‚ÄìJuly 2017 security breach. In July 2019, Equifax settled with the Federal Trade Commission for $700 million. This number contains a $380,500,000 consumer restitution fund, part of the class action lawsuit. =Website malware= On October 12, 2017, Equifax's website was reported to have been offering visitors malware via drive-by download. The malware was disguised as an update for Adobe Flash. At that time, only 3 out of 65 top anti-malware products provided protection against the particular malware, meaning that many visitors were at risk of having their computers infected if visiting the Equifax website. On October 13, 2017, the attack was revealed to have been performed by hijacking third- party analytics JavaScript from Digital River brand FireClick. Also on October 13, 2017, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service was reported to have suspended a $7.2 million contract with Equifax, as a result of the attack. Lawsuits and fines The company has been fined by the Federal Trade Commission on two occasions for violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\\"FCRA\\"). In 2000, Equifax, along with Experian and TransUnion, was fined $2.5 million for blocking and delaying phone calls from consumers trying to get information about their credit. In 2003, the FTC took Equifax to court for the same reason and settled its lawsuit with the company for a fine of $250,000.Equifax Fined $250,000 Fine By FTC , NBC 10, August 3, 2003, retrieved September 13, 2007 In July 2013, a federal jury in Oregon awarded $18.6 million to Julie Miller of Marion County against Equifax for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In her lawsuit, Miller alleged Equifax had merged her credit reports with another person with a different Social Security number, date of birth, and address. Miller contacted Equifax repeatedly in writing and over the telephone, but Equifax refused to delete dozens of false collection accounts from Miller's credit report. The award included $18.4 million in punitive damages, and $180,000 in compensatory damages. Miller's lawyer, Justin Baxter, explained that the false reporting damaged Miller's reputation, she was denied credit, and her private information was given to businesses Miller had no relationship with. The jury's verdict is believed to be the largest award in an individual case under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. An Equifax spokesperson said that Equifax is considering appealing the jury's verdict. A federal judge reduced the award to $1.62 million in 2014. In 2014, Equifax and Heartland Bank were sued by Kimberly Haman of the St. Louis area for reporting she was dead. A Heartland Bank spokesperson said the bank \\"immediately investigated and contacted the credit reporting agencies after Haman reported\\" she was still alive. An Equifax \\"spokesperson told the Post-Dispatch that Equifax blocked the Heartland account information from appearing on Haman's credit report after a reporter's inquiry.\\" In April 2014, Equifax was sued in New York federal court by God Gazarov, who claimed the company erroneously reports him as having no credit history because of his unusual first name. On November 4, 2017, it was reported that a group of five Oklahomans had sued the company, claiming that Equifax \\"violated laws which require financial institutions to protect the security of their customers' personal information.\\"\\"Oklahomans File Lawsuit Against Equifax\\", NewsOn6, November 4, 2017 Equifax selected the law firm DLA Piper to work on the case in D.C. It had turned to Edelman for earlier crisis control after the October 2017 privacy breach.\\"Equifax Picks DLA Piper\\", Kevin McCauley, O'Dwyer's, October 23, 2017 Consumer lawsuits claiming damages under the FCRA have been successful in small claims court. Equifax software engineer Sudhakar Reddy was charged with insider trading for purchasing options prior to the disclosure of the 2017 data breach. In January 2020, Equifax agreed to a global settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and 50 U.S. states and territories. For those that were affected by the data breach, there were open suggestions to file claims against it. The settlement includes up to $425 million to help people affected by the data breach. Equifax ultimately reached a settlement with regulators for up to $700 million.

Tieguanyin produced in different areas of Anxi have different gastronomic characteristics. Name The tea is named after the Chinese Goddess of Mercy Guanyin, who is known in Japan as Kannon and in Korea as Gwan-eum. Guanyin is an embodiment of Avalokite≈õvara Bodhisattva. Other spellings and names include \\"Ti Kuan Yin\\", \\"Tit Kwun Yum\\", \\"Ti Kwan Yin\\", \\"Iron Buddha\\", \\"Iron Goddess Oolong\\", and \\"Tea of the Iron Bodhisattva\\". It is also known in its abbreviated form as \\"TGY\\". Legends There are two legends behind this tea: Wei and Wang. =Wei legend= In Fujian's Anxi County, there was a run-down temple which held an iron statue of Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. Every day on the walk to his tea fields, a poor farmer named Wei would pass by and reflect on the temple's worsening condition. ‚ÄúSomething has to be done,‚Äù he thought. Being poor, Wei did not have the means to repair the temple. One day, he brought a broom and some incense from his home. He swept the temple clean and lit the incense as an offering to Guanyin. \\"It's the least I can do,\\" he thought to himself. And he did this twice a month for many months. One night, Guanyin appeared to him in a dream, telling him of a cave behind the temple where a treasure awaited. He was to take the treasure and share it with others. In the cave, the farmer found a tea shoot. He planted it in his field and nurtured it into a large bush, from which the finest tea was produced. He gave cuttings of this rare plant to all his neighbors and began selling the tea under the name Tieguanyin, Iron Bodhisattva of Compassion. Over time, Wei and all his neighbors prospered; the run-down temple of Guanyin was repaired and became a beacon for the region. From this time onwards Mr. Wei took joy in the daily trip to his tea fields, never failing to stop in appreciation of the beautiful temple. =Wang legend= Wang was a scholar who accidentally discovered the tea plant beneath the Guanyin rock in Xiping. He brought the plant back home for cultivation. When he visited the Qianlong Emperor in the 6th year of his reign, he offered the tea as a gift from his native village. The emperor was so impressed that he inquired about its origin. Since the tea was discovered beneath the Guanyin Rock, he decided to call it the Guanyin tea. Processing of Tieguanyin tea Processing Chart of Tieguanyin tea. The processing of Tieguanyin tea is complex and requires expertise. Even if the tea leaf is of high raw quality and is plucked at the ideal time, if it is not processed correctly, its true character will not be shown. This is why the method of processing Tieguanyin tea was kept a secret. # plucking tea leaves () # sun withering () # cooling () # tossing () # withering, this includes some oxidation. () # fixation () # rolling () # drying () After drying some teas go through the added processes of roasting and scenting. Varieties By roasting level: * Jade Tieguanyin (lightly baked Tieguanyin) is a newer type of Tieguanyin developed in the 1990s and has a light green jade color. It produces a very flowery aroma and taste. It is more similar to green tea than Oolong. * Thoroughly baked Tieguanyin is the original style. It has a more complex taste profile and warm aroma, but the traditional baking technique has not been passed on well, so quality ones of this style are less seen in the market than \\"moderately baked\\" and \\"lightly baked\\" versions. * Moderately baked Tieguanyin is a new breed that some argue has a good balance of floral aroma and complex taste, but it stores poorly. By harvest time: * Spring Tieguanyin is harvested around Li Xia (Start of Summer) and has the best overall quality. * Autumn Tieguanyin is harvested in the autumn and has strong aroma but less complex taste. * Summer Tieguanyin is harvested in summer and is considered lower-quality. Summer Tieguanyin can be further divided into two types: one harvested in June to July, one harvested in August. * Winter Tieguanyin is harvested in winter. Production of Winter Tieguanyin is very low. Other categories: * Guanyin Wang (Guanyin \\"King\\") is the best of Jade Tieguanyin and Autumn Tieguanyin. Types Based on the different roasting methods and locations, there are various types of Tieguanyin. *Anxi Tieguanyin Tea ÂÆâÊ∫™ÈâÑË¶≥Èü≥ ‚Äì Recently, this oolong is typically close to a green tea, with only a little oxidation. With a very flowery and fresh delicate aroma character, the tea liquid is golden yellow. In the past, the tea was traditionally more heavily roasted. *Muzha Tieguanyin Tea Êú®ÊüµÈâÑË¶≥Èü≥ ‚Äì This traditional oolong is roasted and has a stronger taste and with roast nutty character; the tea liquid is reddish brown. In Taiwan, the name Iron Goddess Tea is also used to describe a type of oolong tea that is roasted using the Iron Goddess Tea method, regardless of the type of tea leaves used. Therefore, Taiwanese Iron Goddess Tea could be made with Iron Goddess Tea leaves, or without. Market value The top varieties of Tieguanyin rank among the most expensive tea in the world, with one variety reportedly sold at around 3000 USD per kilogram. According to one source, it set the record for most expensive tea ever sold in the United Kingdom. However, that variety of Tieguanyin did not outsell a rarer Da Hong Pao oolong, which is the most expensive tea sold on the global market.

In 1970, Martinez and Palomo discovered the cell coat in animal cells, which is known as the glycocalyx. Most animal epithelial cells have a fuzz-like coating on the external surface of their plasma membranes. This coating consists of several carbohydrate moieties of membrane glycolipids and glycoproteins, which serve as backbone molecules for support. Generally, the carbohydrate portion of the glycolipids found on the surface of plasma membranes helps these molecules contribute to cell‚Äìcell recognition, communication, and intercellular adhesion.McKinley, M. & V.D. O‚ÄôLoughlin. Human Anatomy. McGraw-Hill, 2012. 3rd ed. p. 30-31. The glycocalyx is a type of identifier that the body uses to distinguish between its own healthy cells and transplanted tissues, diseased cells, or invading organisms. Included in the glycocalyx are cell-adhesion molecules that enable cells to adhere to each other and guide the movement of cells during embryonic development.Saladin, Kenneth. \\"Anatomy & Physiology: The unity of form and function.\\" McGraw Hill. 5th Edition. 2010. p. 94-95 The glycocalyx plays a major role in regulation of endothelial vascular tissue, including the modulation of red blood cell volume in capillaries.Reitsma, Sietze. \\"The endothelial glycocalyx: composition, functions, and visualization.\\" European Journal of Physiology. 2007. Vol. 454. Num. 3. p. 345-359 The slime on the outside of a fish is an example of glycocalyx. The term was initially applied to the polysaccharide matrix coating epithelial cells, but its functions have been discovered to go well beyond that. In vascular endothelial tissue The glycocalyx is located on the apical surface of vascular endothelial cells which line the lumen. When vessels are stained with cationic dyes such as Alcian blue stain, transmission electron microscopy shows a small, irregularly shaped layer extending approximately 50‚Äì100 nm into the lumen of a blood vessel. Another study used cryotransmission electron microscopy and showed that the endothelial glycocalyx could be up to 11 Œºm thick. It is present throughout a diverse range of microvascular beds (capillaries) and macrovessels (arteries and veins). The glycocalyx also consists of a wide range of enzymes and proteins that regulate leukocyte and thrombocyte adherence, since its principal role in the vasculature is to maintain plasma and vessel-wall homeostasis. These enzymes and proteins include: *Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (endothelial NOS) *Extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3) *Angiotensin converting enzyme *Antithrombin-III *Lipoprotein lipase *Apolipoproteins *Growth factors *Chemokines The enzymes and proteins listed above serve to reinforce the glycocalyx barrier against vascular and other diseases. Another main function of the glycocalyx within the vascular endothelium is that it shields the vascular walls from direct exposure to blood flow, while serving as a vascular permeability barrier.Van de Berg, Bernard M., Max Nieuwdorp, Erik S.G. Stroes, Hans Vink. \\"Glycocalyx and endothelial (dys) function: from mice to men.\\" Pharmacological Reports, 2006, 57: 75-80. Its protective functions are universal throughout the vascular system, but its relative importance varies depending on its exact location in the vasculature. In microvascular tissue, the glycocalyx serves as a vascular permeability barrier by inhibiting coagulation and leukocyte adhesion. Leukocytes must not stick to the vascular wall because they are important components of the immune system that must be able to travel to a specific region of the body when needed. In arterial vascular tissue, the glycocalyx also inhibits coagulation and leukocyte adhesion, but through mediation of shear stress-induced nitric oxide release. Another protective function throughout the cardiovascular system is its ability to affect the filtration of interstitial fluid from capillaries into the interstitial space.Drake-Holland, Angela & Mark Noble. \\"The Important New Drug Target in Cardiovascular Medicine ‚Äì the Vascular Glycocalyx.\\" Cardiovascular & Haematological Disorders-Drug Targets, 2009, 9, p. 118-123 The glycocalyx, which is located on the apical surface of endothelial cells, is composed of a negatively charged network of proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids.Van de Berg, Bernard M., Max Nieuwdorp, Erik S.G. Stroes, Hans Vink. Glycocalyx and endothelial (dys) function: from mice to men. Pharmacological Reports, 2006, 57: 75-80. Disruption and disease Because the glycocalyx is so prominent throughout the cardiovascular system, disruption to this structure has detrimental effects that can cause disease. Certain stimuli that cause atheroma may lead to enhanced sensitivity of vasculature. Initial dysfunction of the glycocalyx can be caused by hyperglycemia or oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which then causes atherothrombosis. In microvasculature, dysfunction of the glycocalyx leads to internal fluid imbalance, and potentially edema. In arterial vascular tissue, glycocalyx disruption causes inflammation and atherothrombosis.Drake-Holland, Angela & Mark Noble. \\"The Important New Drug Target in Cardiovascular Medicine ‚Äì the Vascular Glycocalyx.\\" Cardiovascular & Haematological Disorders-Drug Targets, 2009, 9, p. 118‚Äì123 Experiments have been performed to test precisely how the glycocalyx can be altered or damaged. One particular study used an isolated perfused heart model designed to facilitate detection of the state of the vascular barrier portion, and sought to cause insult-induced shedding of the glycocalyx to ascertain the cause-and-effect relationship between glycocalyx shedding and vascular permeability. Hypoxic perfusion of the glycocalyx was thought to be sufficient to initiate a degradation mechanism of the endothelial barrier. The study found that flow of oxygen throughout the blood vessels did not have to be completely absent (ischemic hypoxia), but that minimal levels of oxygen were sufficient to cause the degradation. Shedding of the glycocalyx can be triggered by inflammatory stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Whatever the stimulus is, however, shedding of the glycocalyx leads to a drastic increase in vascular permeability. Vascular walls being permeable is disadvantageous, since that would enable passage of some macromolecules or other harmful antigens.Annecke, T., et al. \\"Shedding of the coronary endothelial glycocalyx: effects of hypoxia/reoxygenation vs ischaemia/reperfusion.\\" British Journal of Anaesthesia, 2011. 107 (5): 679‚Äì86 Fluid shear stress is also a potential problem if the glycocalyx is degraded for any reason. This type of frictional stress is caused by the movement of viscous fluid (i.e. blood) along the lumen boundary. Another similar experiment was carried out to determine what kinds of stimuli cause fluid shear stress. The initial measurement was taken with intravital microscopy, which showed a slow-moving plasma layer, the glycocalyx, of 1 Œºm thick. Light dye damaged the glycocalyx minimally, but that small change increased capillary hematocrit. Thus, fluorescence light microscopy should not be used to study the glycocalyx because that particular method uses a dye. The glycocalyx can also be reduced in thickness when treated with oxidized LDL.Gouverneur, Mirella. Dissertation. \\"Fluid shear stress directly stimulates synthesis of the endothelial glycocalyx : perturbations by hyperglycemia.\\" 2006. University of Amsterdam. p. 115‚Äì153 These stimuli, along with many other factors, can cause damage to the delicate glycocalyx. These studies are evidence that the glycocalyx plays a crucial role in cardiovascular system health. In bacteria and nature 201x201px A glycocalyx, literally meaning \\"sugar coat\\" (glykys = sweet, kalyx = husk), is a network of polysaccharides that project from cellular surfaces of bacteria, which classifies it as a universal surface component of a bacterial cell, found just outside the bacterial cell wall. A distinct, gelatinous glycocalyx is called a capsule, whereas an irregular, diffuse layer is called a slime layer. This coat is extremely hydrated and stains with ruthenium red. Bacteria growing in natural ecosystems, such as in soil, bovine intestines, or the human urinary tract, are surrounded by some sort of glycocalyx-enclosed microcolony.Costerton & Irvin. Bacterial Glycocalyx in Nature and Disease. Annual Reviews Microbiology, 1981. Vol. 35: p. 299-324 It serves to protect the bacterium from harmful phagocytes by creating capsules or allowing the bacterium to attach itself to inert surfaces, such as teeth or rocks, via biofilms (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae attaches itself to either lung cells, prokaryotes, or other bacteria which can fuse their glycocalices to envelop the colony). In the digestive tract A glycocalyx can also be found on the apical portion of microvilli within the digestive tract, especially within the small intestine. It creates a meshwork 0.3 Œºm thick and consists of acidic mucopolysaccharides and glycoproteins that project from the apical plasma membrane of epithelial absorptive cells. It provides additional surface for adsorption and includes enzymes secreted by the absorptive cells that are essential for the final steps of digestion of proteins and sugars. Other generalized functions *Protection: Cushions the plasma membrane and protects it from chemical injury *Immunity to infection: Enables the immune system to recognize and selectively attack foreign organisms *Defense against cancer: Changes in the glycocalyx of cancerous cells enable the immune system to recognize and destroy them. *Transplant compatibility: Forms the basis for compatibility of blood transfusions, tissue grafts, and organ transplants *Cell adhesion: Binds cells together so that tissues do not fall apart *Inflammation regulation: Glycocalyx coating on endothelial walls in blood vessels prevents leukocytes from rolling/binding in healthy states.Near-Wall {micro}-PIV Reveals a Hydrodynamically Relevant Endothelial Surface Layer in Venules In Vivo - Smith et al. 85 (1): 637 - Biophysical Journal *Fertilization: Enables sperm to recognize and bind to eggs *Embryonic development: Guides embryonic cells to their destinations in the body References  External links  * Smart carbohydrate chemistry as a means to understand glycocalyx biology ‚Äì Video by the Lindhorst group at Beilstein TV Cell biology Polysaccharides Glycobiology Polymers ","title":"Glycocalyx"},{"id":"961297","text":"The Shanghai Grand Theatre Jean-Marie Charpentier (27 April 1939 - 24 December 2010) was a French architect and urban planner.

It was probably discovered by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654 and included by Charles Messier in his catalog of comet-like objects in 1764. Messier described it as, \\"A cluster of small stars a little below the parallel of Œ≥ (Andromedae). In an ordinary telescope of 3 feet one can distinguish the stars.\\" Based on the distance modulus of 8.38, this cluster is located at a distance of about 470 parsecs, or 1,500 light years. For stars in the range from 0.12 to 1.0 solar masses, M34 contains an estimated 400 members. It spans about 35' on the sky which translates to a true radius of 7.5 light years. The cluster is just visible to the naked eye in very dark conditions, well away from city lights. It is possible to see it in binoculars when light pollution is limited. The age of this cluster lies between the respective ages of the Pleiades open cluster at 100 million years and the Hyades open cluster at 800 million years. Comparisons between the observed stellar spectra and the values predicted by stellar evolutionary models gives an age estimate of 200‚Äì250 million years for M34. This is roughly the age at which stars with 0.5 solar masses enter the main sequence. By comparison, stars like the Sun enter the main sequence after 30 million years. The average proportion of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium is termed the metallicity by astronomers. This is expressed by the logarithm of the ratio of iron to hydrogen, compared to the same proportion in the Sun. For M34, the metallicity has a value of [Fe/H] = +0.07 ¬± 0.04. This is equivalent to a 17% higher proportion of iron compared to the Sun. Other elements show a similar abundance, with the exception of nickel which is underabundant. At least 19 members of this cluster are white dwarfs. These are stellar remnants of progenitor stars of up to eight solar masses that have evolved through the main sequence and are no longer engaged in thermonuclear fusion to generate energy. Seventeen of the white dwarfs are of spectral type DA or DAZ, while one is a type DB and the last is a type DC.

It is a heraldic cross variant which developed from earlier forms of eight- pointed crosses in the 16th century. Although chiefly associated with the Knights Hospitaller (Order of St. John, now the Sovereign Military Order of Malta), and by extension with the island of Malta, it has come to be used by a wide array of entities since the early modern period, notably the Order of Saint Stephen, the city of Amalfi, the Polish Order of the White Eagle (1709) and the Prussian order Pour le M√©rite (1740).

Numerous other modern orders of merit have used the eight-pointed cross. The British colony of Queensland, Australia, adopted the Maltese cross as the state badge and on the flag in 1876 for reasons unknown; use of it continutes through to statehood. The eight points of the eight-pointed cross have been given a number of symbolic interpretations, such as representing the eight Langues of the Knights Hospitaller (Auvergne, Provence, France, Aragon, Castille and Portugal, Italy, Germany, and the British Isles).\\"The Maltese Cross and its significance\\" GuidetoMalta.net, History. Accessed 17 July 2013. or alternatively the \\"eight obligations or aspirations\\" of the knights. Websites operated by both the German Order of Saint John (Johanniterorden) and the British Venerable Order of St John associate the eight points with the Eight Beatitudes. An undated leaflet published by The Venerable Order's main service organisation, St John Ambulance, has also applied secular meanings to the points as representing the traits of a good first aider.

Twenty-five emblem designs were tested, but the emblem depicting four blurred rotor blades, referred to as the \\"Maltese cross\\", was selected as the standard heliport marking pattern by the Army for military heliports, and by the FAA for civil heliports. However, in the late 1970s, the FAA administrator repealed this standard when it was charged that the Maltese cross was antisemitic. In the United States today, some helipads still remain bearing their original Maltese cross emblems. The eight-pointed cross is also used to identify the final approach fix in a nonprecision instrument approach (one that lacks precision vertical guidance), in contrast to the use of a lightning bolt-type icon, which identifies the final approach fix in a precision approach. =Maritime= The vessel classification society for the United States, the American Bureau of Shipping, will assign the Maltese cross symbol to vessels and offshore units for which the hull construction and/or the manufacture of its machinery and components and any associated required testing, as applicable, is carried out under ABS survey. =Medical= Several orders that are descended from the original Order of St John set up first aid and ambulance services.

Passengers holding tickets to a London fare zone marked with a Maltese cross can make one journey from the London Terminal at which they arrived to the zone in question. Eponymy The \\"Maltese cross flower\\" (Lychnis chalcedonica) is so named because its petals are similarly shaped, though its points are more rounded into \\"heart\\"-like shapes. The flower Tripterocalyx crux-maltae was also named for the Maltese cross.CalFlora Botanical Names: T. crux-maltae The Geneva drive, a device that translates a continuous rotation into an intermittent rotary motion, is also sometimes called a \\"Maltese cross mechanism\\" after the shape of its main gear. Similar crosses Standard form of the cross patt√©e Cross of Saint Florian, often mistaken for a Maltese cross Eight-pointed crosses have been adapted for use in the cross of Saint Lazarus and as part of the flag of Wallis and Futuna. It has been the official badge (combined with an ellipsoid in the center) of the Delta Phi fraternity since 1833. A similar cross is also used by the Veterans of Foreign Wars organization. A variant of the Maltese cross, with three V-shaped arms instead of four, was used as the funnel symbol of the Hamburg Atlantic Line and their successors German Atlantic Line and Hanseatic Tours in 1958‚Äì1973 and 1991‚Äì1997. A five-armed variant is the \\"Cross\\" of the French Legion of Honour (Croix de la L√©gion d'honneur). A seven-armed variant, known as the \\"Maltese asterisk\\", is used as the basis of Britain's Order of St Michael and St George. Other crosses with spreading limbs are often mistakenly called \\"Maltese\\", especially the cross patt√©e. The royal warrant which created the Victoria Cross prescribed a Maltese cross, but the medal has always in fact been a cross patt√©e. The official symbol of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity is the cross patt√©e, though the organization's founder thought it was a Maltese cross when the organization was formed in 1865. The Nestorian cross also is very similar to both of these. The Firefighter's Cross sometimes mistakenly called the Cross of Saint Florian, for the patron saint of firefighters, is often confused with the Maltese cross (for example, the New York City Fire Department so calls it);History and Heritage / Origin of The Maltese Cross Accessed 17 July 2013. although it may have eight or more points, it also has large curved arcs between the points. The Philadelphia Fire Department, among others, incorporates the Firefighter's Cross into its insignia, as does the International Association of Fire Fighters. The Maltese cross should not be mistaken for the George Cross, awarded to Malta by George VI of the United Kingdom in 1942, which is depicted, since 1964, on the national flag of Malta.

It consists of a monomolecular layer composed of identical proteins or glycoproteins. This structure is built via self-assembly and encloses the whole cell surface. Thus, the S-layer protein can represent up to 15% of the whole protein content of a cell. S-layer proteins are poorly conserved or not conserved at all, and can differ markedly even between related species. Depending on species, the S-layers have a thickness between 5 and 25 nm and possess identical pores with 2‚Äì8 nm in diameter. The terminology ‚ÄúS-layer‚Äù was used the first time in 1976. The general use was accepted at the \\"First International Workshop on Crystalline Bacterial Cell Surface Layers, Vienna (Austria)\\" in 1984, and in the year 1987 S-layers were defined at the European Molecular Biology Organization Workshop on ‚ÄúCrystalline Bacterial Cell Surface Layers‚Äù, Vienna as ‚ÄúTwo-dimensional arrays of proteinaceous subunits forming surface layers on prokaryotic cells‚Äù (see \\"Preface\\", page VI in Sleytr \\"et al. 1988\\"). For a brief summary on the history of S-layer research see references  Location of S-layers  50px. * In Gram-negative bacteria, S-layers are associated to the lipopolysaccharides via ionic, carbohydrate‚Äìcarbohydrate, protein‚Äìcarbohydrate interactions and/or protein‚Äìprotein interactions. * In Gram-positive bacteria whose S-layers often contain surface layer homology (SLH) domains, the binding occurs to the peptidoglycan and to a secondary cell wall polymer (e.g., teichoic acids). In the absence of SLH domains, the binding occurs via electrostatic interactions between the positively charged N-terminus of the S-layer protein and a negatively charged secondary cell wall polymer. In Lactobacilli the binding domain may be located at the C-terminus. * In Gram- negative archaea, S-layer proteins possess a hydrophobic anchor that is associated with the underlying lipid membrane. * In Gram-positive archaea, the S-layer proteins bind to pseudomurein or to methanochondroitin.  Biological functions of the S-layer  For many bacteria, the S-layer represents the outermost interaction zone with their respective environment. Its functions are very diverse and vary from species to species. In many archaeal species the S-layer is the only cell wall component and, therefore, is important for mechanical and osmotic stabilization. Additional functions associated with S-layers include: * protection against bacteriophages, Bdellovibrios, and phagocytosis * resistance against low pH * barrier against high-molecular- weight substances (e.g., lytic enzymes) * adhesion (for glycosylated S-layers) * stabilisation of the membrane (e.g. the SDBC in Deinococcus radiodurans) * resistance against electromagnetic stress (e.g. ionizing radiations and high temperatures) * provision of adhesion sites for exoproteins * provision of a periplasmic compartment in Gram-positive prokaryotes together with the peptidoglycan and the cytoplasmic membranes * anti-fouling properties * biomineralization * molecular sieve and barrier function S-layer structure  While ubiquitous among Archaea, and common in bacteria, the S-layers of diverse organisms have unique structural properties, including symmetry and unit cell dimensions, due to fundamental differences in their constituent building blocks. Sequence analyses of S-layer proteins have predicted that S-layer proteins have sizes of 40-200 kDa and may be composed of multiple domains some of which may be structurally related. Since the first evidence of a macromolecular array on a bacterial cell wall fragment in the 1950s S-layer structure has been investigated extensively by electron microscopy and medium resolution images of S-layers from these analyses has provided useful information on overall S-layer morphology. High-resolution structures of an archaeal S-layer protein (MA0829 from Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A) of the Methanosarcinales S-layer Tile Protein family and a bacterial S-layer protein (SbsB), from Geobacillus stearothermophilus PV72, have recently been determined by X-ray crystallography. In contrast with existing crystal structures, which have represented individual domains of S-layer proteins or minor proteinaceous components of the S-layer, the MA0829 and SbsB structures have allowed high resolution models of the M. acetivorans and G. stearothermophilus S-layers to be proposed. These models exhibit hexagonal (p6) and oblique (p2) symmetry, for M. acetivorans and G. stearothermophilus S-layers, respectively, and their molecular features, including dimensions and porosity, are in good agreement with data from electron microscopy studies of archaeal and bacterial S-layers. In general, S-layers exhibit either an oblique (p1, p2), square (p4) or hexagonal (p3, p6) lattice symmetry. Depending on the lattice symmetry, each morphological unit of the S-layer is composed of one (p1), two (p2), three (p3), four (p4), or six (p6) identical protein subunits. The center-to-center spacing (or unit cell dimensions) between these subunits range from 4 to 35 nm.  Self-assembly  = In vivo assembly = Assembly of a highly ordered coherent monomolecular S-layer array on a growing cell surface requires a continuous synthesis of a surplus of S-layer proteins and their translocation to sites of lattice growth. Moreover, information concerning this dynamic process were obtained from reconstitution experiments with isolated S-layer subunits on cell surfaces from which they had been removed (homologous reattachment) or on those of other organisms (heterologous reattachment). = In vitro assembly = S-layer proteins have the natural capability to self-assemble into regular monomolecular arrays in solution and at interfaces, such as solid supports, the air-water interface, lipid films, liposomes, emulsomes, nanocapsules, nanoparticles or micro beads. S-layer crystal growth follows a non-classical pathway in which a final refolding step of the S-layer protein is part of the lattice formation.  Application  Native S-layer proteins have already been used three decades ago in the development of biosensors and ultrafiltration membranes. Subsequently, S-layer fusion proteins with specific functional domains (e.g. enzymes, ligands, mimotopes, antibodies or antigens) allowed to investigate completely new strategies for functionalizing surfaces in the life sciences, such as in the development of novel affinity matrices, mucosal vaccines, biocompatible surfaces, micro carriers and encapsulation systems, or in the material sciences as templates for biomineralization.

It is situated in the East Wall area. East Point Business Park (pond) There are over 50 companies in the park with 6,000 employees. History The park is situated on land reclaimed from Dublin Bay and the River Tolka estuary. The first phase of the park was opened for business around 1996. The site where EastPoint is located was intended to be a location for a new City Airport in Dublin, similar to London City Airport. When this plan ultimately proved impractical, the site was acquired by Earlsfort Centre Developments. Earlsfort engaged Scott Tallon Walker to design the Park and the buildings and the landscaping was designed by Charles Funke. It became necessary, because of the route of the Dublin Port Tunnel, to construct a new bridge and causeway from Alfie Byrne Road to access the Park. The success of the initial phase of EastPoint led to Earlsfort and Dublin Port Company entering a joint venture to develop a further phase. This brought the size of the Park to Circa with Circa 140,000 square meters (1.5 m square feet) of mainly offices in 37 buildings. This also provided a further entrance to the Park from Bond Road thus enhancing access from the South City. Major companies Major companies based in East Point Office Park include among others Cisco, Google, Oracle, Enterprise Ireland, Deutsche Bank, CITRIX Systems, QuintilesIms, Ergo, FINEOS and Virgin Media Ireland. Enterprise Ireland leased one of the buildings within the park to serve as its new head office, in a move aimed at merging its four Dublin offices together at one central location, from the end of 2007. Transport The park is not served directly by any public transport. To alleviate this, a shuttle bus fleet provide free-of-charge service to Clontarf Road railway station during railway operating hours; and to near the Point Village stop on the Luas red line during peak hours. https://www.eastpoint.ie/Shuttle-Bus-and-Location  Location  EastPoint is Dublin‚Äôs only central office park, located less than 2 kilometres from the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC), the purpose-built Convention Centre Dublin overlooking the River Liffey, and other landmarks such as the 3Arena (formerly known as The O2) venue at the Point Village.

The close proximity to their stars and high surface- atmosphere temperatures resulted in the moniker \\"hot Jupiters\\". Hot Jupiters are the easiest extrasolar planets to detect via the radial-velocity method, because the oscillations they induce in their parent stars' motion are relatively large and rapid compared to those of other known types of planets. One of the best-known hot Jupiters is . Discovered in 1995, it was the first extrasolar planet found orbiting a Sun-like star. has an orbital period of about 4 days.  General characteristics  transit method, indicated with black dots) discovered up to Hot Jupiter with hidden water Though there is diversity among hot Jupiters, they do share some common properties. * Their defining characteristics are their large masses and short orbital periods, spanning 0.36‚Äì11.8 Jupiter masses and 1.3‚Äì111 Earth days. The mass cannot be greater than approximately 13.6 Jupiter masses because then the pressure and temperature inside the planet would be high enough to cause deuterium fusion, and the planet would be a brown dwarf. * Most have nearly circular orbits (low eccentricities). It is thought that their orbits are circularized by perturbations from nearby stars or tidal forces. Whether they remain in these circular orbits for long periods of time or collide with their host stars depends on the coupling of their orbital and physical evolution, which are related through the dissipation of energy and tidal deformation. * Many have unusually low densities. The lowest one measured thus far is that of TrES-4 at 0.222 g/cm3. The large radii of hot Jupiters are not yet fully understood but it is thought that the expanded envelopes can be attributed to high stellar irradiation, high atmospheric opacities, possible internal energy sources, and orbits close enough to their stars for the outer layers of the planets to exceed their Roche limit and be pulled further outward. * Usually they are tidally locked, with one side always facing its host star. * They are likely to have extreme and exotic atmospheres due to their short periods, relatively long days, and tidal locking. Atmospheric dynamics models predict strong vertical stratification with intense winds and super-rotating equatorial jets driven by radiative forcing and the transfer of heat and momentum. The day- night temperature difference at the photosphere is predicted to be substantial, approximately 500 K for a model based on HD 209458b. * They appear to be more common around F- and G-type stars and less so around K-type stars. Hot Jupiters around red dwarfs are very rare. Generalizations about the distribution of these planets must take into account the various observational biases, but in general their prevalence decreases exponentially as a function of the absolute stellar magnitude.  Formation and evolution  There are two general schools of thought regarding the origin of hot Jupiters: formation at a distance followed by inward migration and in-situ formation at the distances at which they're currently observed. The prevalent view is formation via orbital migration. = Migration = In the migration hypothesis, a hot Jupiter forms beyond the frost line, from rock, ice, and gases via the core accretion method of planetary formation. The planet then migrates inwards to the star where it eventually forms a stable orbit. The planet may have migrated inward smoothly via type II orbital migration. Or it may have migrated more suddenly due to gravitational scattering onto eccentric orbits during an encounter with another massive planet, followed by the circularization and shrinking of the orbits due to tidal interactions with the star. A hot Jupiter's orbit could also have been altered via the Kozai mechanism, causing an exchange of inclination for eccentricity resulting in a high eccentricity low perihelion orbit, in combination with tidal friction. This requires a massive body‚Äîanother planet or a stellar companion‚Äîon a more distant and inclined orbit; approximately 50% of hot Jupiters have distant Jupiter-mass or larger companions, which can leave the hot Jupiter with an orbit inclined relative to the star's rotation. The type II migration happens during the solar nebula phase, i.e. when gas is still present. Energetic stellar photons and strong stellar winds at this time remove most of the remaining nebula. Migration via the other mechanism can happen after the loss of the gas disk. = In situ = Instead of being gas giants that migrated inward, in an alternate hypothesis the cores of the hot Jupiters began as more common super-Earths which accreted their gas envelopes at their current locations, becoming gas giants in situ. The super-Earths providing the cores in this hypothesis could have formed either in situ or at greater distances and have undergone migration before acquiring their gas envelopes. Since super-Earths are often found with companions, the hot Jupiters formed in situ could also be expected to have companions. The increase of the mass of the locally growing hot Jupiter has a number of possible effects on neighboring planets. If the hot Jupiter maintains an eccentricity greater than 0.01, sweeping secular resonances can increase the eccentricity of a companion planet, causing it to collide with the hot Jupiter. The core of the hot Jupiter in this case would be unusually large. If the hot Jupiter's eccentricity remains small the sweeping secular resonances could also tilt the orbit of the companion. Traditionally, the in situ mode of conglomeration has been disfavored because the assembly of massive cores, which is necessary for the formation of hot Jupiters, requires surface densities of solids ‚âà 104 g/cm2, or larger. Recent surveys, however, have found that the inner regions of planetary systems are frequently occupied by super-Earth type planets. If these super-Earths formed at greater distances and migrated closer, the formation of in situ hot Jupiters is not entirely in situ. =Atmospheric loss= If the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter is stripped away via hydrodynamic escape, its core may become a chthonian planet. The amount of gas removed from the outermost layers depends on the planet's size, the gases forming the envelope, the orbital distance from the star, and the star's luminosity. In a typical system, a gas giant orbiting at 0.02 AU around its parent star loses 5‚Äì7% of its mass during its lifetime, but orbiting closer than 0.015 AU can mean evaporation of a substantially larger fraction of the planet's mass. No such objects have been found yet and they are still hypothetical. From top left to lower right: WASP-12b, WASP-6b, WASP-31b, WASP-39b, HD 189733b, HAT-P-12b, WASP-17b, WASP-19b, HAT-P-1b and HD 209458b.  Terrestrial planets in systems with hot Jupiters  Simulations have shown that the migration of a Jupiter-sized planet through the inner protoplanetary disk (the region between 5 and 0.1 AU from the star) is not as destructive as expected. More than 60% of the solid disk materials in that region are scattered outward, including planetesimals and protoplanets, allowing the planet-forming disk to reform in the gas giant's wake. In the simulation, planets up to two Earth masses were able to form in the habitable zone after the hot Jupiter passed through and its orbit stabilized at 0.1 AU. Due to the mixing of inner-planetary-system material with outer-planetary-system material from beyond the frost line, simulations indicated that the terrestrial planets that formed after a hot Jupiter's passage would be particularly water-rich. According to a 2011 study, hot Jupiters may become disrupted planets while migrating inwards; this could explain an abundance of \\"hot\\" Earth-sized to Neptune-sized planets within 0.2 AU of their host star. In 2015, two planets were discovered around WASP-47. One was potentially a large terrestrial planet, of less than 22 Earth masses and 1.8 Earth radii. The other is of similar mass at 15.2 Earth masses, but with 3.6 Earth radii it is almost certainly a gas giant. They orbit on either side of a previously discovered hot Jupiter, with the smaller, terrestrial planet closer in. A similar orbital architecture is also exhibited by the Kepler-30 system. Retrograde orbit It has been found that several hot Jupiters have retrograde orbits, in stark contrast to what would be expected from most theories on planetary formation, though it is possible that the star itself flipped over early in their system's formation due to interactions between the star's magnetic field and the planet-forming disc, rather than the planet's orbit being disturbed. By combining new observations with the old data it was found that more than half of all the hot Jupiters studied have orbits that are misaligned with the rotation axis of their parent stars, and six exoplanets in this study have retrograde motion. Recent research has found that several hot Jupiters are in misaligned systems. This misalignment may be related to the heat of the photosphere the hot Jupiter is orbiting. There are many proposed theories as to why this might occur. One such theory involves tidal dissipation and suggests there is a single mechanism for producing hot Jupiters and this mechanism yields a range of obliquities. Cooler stars with higher tidal dissipation damps the obliquity (explaining why hot Jupiters orbiting cooler stars are well aligned) while hotter stars do not damp the obliquity (explaining the observed misalignment). Ultra-hot Jupiters Ultra-hot Jupiters are hot Jupiters with a dayside temperature greater than 2200K. In such dayside atmospheres most molecules dissociate into their constituent atoms and circulate to the nightside where they recombine into molecules again. Ultra-short period planets Ultra-short period planets (USP) are a class of planets with orbital periods below one day and occur only around stars of less than about 1.25 solar masses. Confirmed transiting hot Jupiters that have orbital periods of less than one day include WASP-18b, WASP-19b, WASP-43b, and WASP-103b. Puffy planets Gas giants with a large radius and very low density are sometimes called \\"puffy planets\\" or \\"hot Saturns\\", due to their density being similar to Saturn's. Puffy planets orbit close to their stars so that the intense heat from the star combined with internal heating within the planet will help inflate the atmosphere. Six large-radius low-density planets have been detected by the transit method. In order of discovery they are: HAT-P-1b, COROT-1b, TrES-4, WASP-12b, WASP-17b, and Kepler-7b. Some hot Jupiters detected by the radial-velocity method may be puffy planets. Most of these planets are below two Jupiter masses as more massive planets have stronger gravity keeping them at roughly Jupiter's size. Even when taking surface heating from the star into account, many transiting hot Jupiters have a larger radius than expected. This could be caused by the interaction between atmospheric winds and the planet's magnetosphere creating an electric current through the planet that heats it up, causing it to expand. The hotter the planet, the greater the atmospheric ionization, and thus the greater the magnitude of the interaction and the larger the electric current, leading to more heating and expansion of the planet. This theory matches the observation that planetary temperature is correlated with inflated planetary radii.  Moons  Theoretical research suggests that hot Jupiters are unlikely to have moons, due to both a small Hill sphere and the tidal forces of the stars they orbit, which would destabilize any satellite's orbit, the latter process being stronger for larger moons. This means that for most hot Jupiters, stable satellites would be small asteroid-sized bodies. Furthermore, the physical evolution of hot Jupiters can determine the final fate of their moons: stall them in semi-asymptotic semimajor axes, or eject them from the system where they may undergo other unknown processes. In spite of this, observations of WASP-12b suggest that it is orbited by at least 1 large exomoon.  Hot Jupiters around red giants  It has been proposed that gas giants orbiting red giants at distances similar to that of Jupiter could be hot Jupiters due to the intense irradiation they would receive from their stars. It is very likely that in the Solar System Jupiter will become a hot Jupiter after the transformation of the Sun into a red giant. The recent discovery of particularly low density gas giants orbiting red giant stars supports this theory. Hot Jupiters orbiting red giants would differ from those orbiting main-sequence stars in a number of ways, most notably the possibility of accreting material from the stellar winds of their stars and, assuming a fast rotation (not tidally locked to their stars), a much more evenly distributed heat with many narrow-banded jets. Their detection using the transit method would be much more difficult due to their tiny size compared to the stars they orbit, as well as the long time needed (months or even years) for one to transit their star as well as to be occulted by it. Star-planet interactions Theoretical research since 2000 suggested that \\"hot Jupiters\\" may cause increased flaring due to the interaction of the magnetic fields of the star and its orbiting exoplanet, or because of tidal forces between them. These effects are called \\"star-planet interactions\\" or SPIs. The HD 189733 system is the best-studied exoplanet system where this effect was thought to occur. In 2008, a team of astronomers first described how as the exoplanet orbiting HD 189733 A reaches a certain place in its orbit, it causes increased stellar flaring. In 2010, a different team found that every time they observe the exoplanet at a certain position in its orbit, they also detected X-ray flares. In 2019, astronomers analyzed data from Arecibo Observatory, MOST, and the Automated Photoelectric Telescope, in addition to historical observations of the star at radio, optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavelengths to examine these claims. They found that the previous claims were exaggerated and the host star failed to display many of the brightness and spectral characteristics associated with stellar flaring and solar active regions, including sunspots. Their statistical analysis also found that many stellar flares are seen regardless of the position of the exoplanet, therefore debunking the earlier claims. The magnetic fields of the host star and exoplanet do not interact, and this system is no longer believed to have a \\"star-planet interaction.\\" Some researchers had also suggested that HD 189733 accretes, or pulls, material from its orbiting exoplanet at a rate similar to those found around young protostars in T Tauri star systems. Later analysis demonstrated that very little, if any, gas was accreted from the \\"hot Jupiter\\" companion.

He played college football for the University of Tennessee. He was drafted by the Bills in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft, and also played for the Tennessee Titans and Denver Broncos. He was a Pro Bowl selection in 2002. Early years Henry was a Parade All-American and \\"Mr. Florida Football\\" as a running back at Frostproof Middle-Senior High School. As a senior for the Bulldogs football team, he rushed for 4,087 yards and 42 touchdowns in 14 games. His team was state runner-up that year, to the Union County Tigers. In addition to football, Henry played basketball and ran track. College career Henry attended the University of Tennessee from 1997 to 2000. While at Tennessee, he played college football under head coach Phillip Fulmer. =1997 season= Henry did not play much in his freshman season due to a very crowded and talented backfield, which contained future NFL running backs Jamal Lewis and Shawn Bryson. He recorded two rushes for four yards on the season. =1998 season= In his sophomore season, Henry was a member of the 1998 National Championship team. In the National Championship, which was the Fiesta Bowl, Henry had 19 rushes for 28 yards and one reception for nine yards. His contributions did expand in his sophomore year. On the season, he had 176 rushing attempts for 970 yards and four touchdowns in regular season play. In addition, he had four receptions for 31 yards in regular season play. =1999 season= In the 1999 season, Henry continued to share the backfield with fellow running back Jamal Lewis and collected 916 yards and eight touchdowns. =2000 season= In Henry's senior season, in which he rushed for 1,314 yards and 11 touchdowns, he was named first-team All-SEC by the Associated Press and the Sporting News. Henry holds the school records for yards rushing (3,078), rushing attempts (556), and 100-yard performances (15). He was nicknamed \\"Cheese\\" by his strength & conditioning coach for being as tough and strong as a block of government cheese. Professional career =2001 NFL Draft= Henry was drafted in the second round with the 58th overall pick in the 2001 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills. He scored a 9 on the Wonderlic Cognitive Ability Test. =Buffalo Bills= With the Buffalo Bills, Henry became the fourth-leading rusher in franchise history, with 3,849 yards and 27 touchdowns with a 4.0 yards per carry average. Over time, he was passed up by Fred Jackson. He earned a Pro Bowl nomination in 2002 after he collected 1,438 yards and 13 touchdowns. In 2004, Henry was injured for part of the year and lost his starting job to the Bills' 2003 first round pick, Willis McGahee. Henry refused to accept becoming McGahee's backup and demanded a trade. Buffalo conceded to his demand and traded him to the Tennessee Titans. Henry then became the backup to Chris Brown. =Tennessee Titans= In July 2005, Henry was dealt to the Tennessee Titans for a third round draft pick in 2006. Henry was suspended four games during the 2005 season for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. After playing backup to Chris Brown for his first season with the Titans, Henry secured the role of starter, and, in 2006, achieved his first 1,000 yard season since 2003. On December 3, 2006, Henry became the 100th running back in NFL history to rush for more than 5,000 career yards. On Christmas Eve in 2006, Henry broke the 1,000 yard mark for the 2006 NFL season against his former team, the Buffalo Bills. Henry played a significant role in the Titans' win as he rushed for 135 yards total. This put Henry at 1,103 rushing yards for the season, with 1 game still remaining, despite being inactive for two games. He finished the 2006 NFL season with 1,211 yards rushing at 4.5 yards per carry. He got into the end zone seven times while only fumbling three times. In addition, he caught 22 passes for 179 yards, at an average of 8.1 yards per reception, giving him 1,282 all- purpose yards. Nevertheless, the Titans released him, which was seen as a cost-cutting move. =Denver Broncos= Not long after his release from the Titans, Henry signed with the Denver Broncos. Henry led the NFL in rushing after the first four games of the 2007 season before injuries would keep him in and out of the lineup throughout the remainder of the season. According to an article written by MyFOX Colorado, it was reported that Henry faced the possibility of being suspended for the remainder of the 2007 season for a positive marijuana test. At the time of the incident, both the Denver Broncos and the NFL refused to comment on the situation. Henry appealed the suspension and his case was taken to Federal courts, allowing him to play until a decision was made. Following the breaking news of Henry's reported positive failure, Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan publicly supported Henry. This led to Shanahan being fined $25,000 by the NFL. Henry won his appeal on December 4, 2007. Henry remained in the substance abuse program, but was not suspended. Henry stated the positive test result was due to second-hand smoke. Henry is reported as passing a lie detector test, as well as a hair follicle test regarding whether or not he smoked marijuana. On February 21, 2008, Henry restructured his contract with the Broncos prior to his scheduled $6 million bonus to stay with the team. Henry had previously stated, \\"I want to make it right to the Broncos, the fans and myself,\\" he said. \\"I want to be a Bronco and make it all right. I don't want to be anywhere else. I owe those people something for all that happened last year. I want to clear my name there. I'm so hungry to do right there.\\" On June 2, 2008, Henry was released from the Denver Broncos just one year into his five-year, $22.5 million deal. \\"We did not feel his commitment to the Broncos was enough to warrant a spot on this football team,\\" said head coach Mike Shanahan in a prepared statement. \\"He's just too inconsistent as a person. I'm not going to get into details what he did do or didn't do. If you don't do the little things, obviously you can't count on somebody. So that's why he's released.\\" At the time Henry was reported to be out of the country and had not yet participated in any Broncos off-season workouts.Broncos Release RB Travis Henry Broncos release RB Travis Henry - NFL - Yahoo! Sports On July 12, 2008, it was revealed that Henry had once again tested positive for marijuana and would be suspended for one year. The failed test was reportedly dated in May 2008, showing that he used marijuana five months after winning his appeal. The Broncos stated that the team was not aware of Henry's test results at the time he was released. =Suspension= On August 31, 2008, Henry was suspended for at least one year by the NFL for violating the league's substance abuse policy. He was reinstated by the NFL following his release from prison in August 2012. Personal life Henry was married once, at age 19, to a woman six years his senior; the marriage was later annulled. He was engaged in 2009, but no marriage has been reported as of January 2016.Travis Henry Says He's Broke After Having 9 Children By 9 Women NY Times, March 12, 2009 Henry has fathered at least 11 children by 10 different women.Michael David Smith (March 12, 2009) After Birth of Twins, Travis Henry Now Has 11 Kids by 10 Women FanHouse Henry has had on-going problems making his child support payments to the mothers of nine of his children.

He is the author of numerous non-fiction books such as The Dictionary of Imaginary Places (co-written with Gianni Guadalupi in 1980), A History of Reading (1996), The Library at Night (2007) and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey: A Biography (2008); and novels such as News From a Foreign Country Came (1991). Though almost all of Manguel's books were written in English, two of his novels (El regreso and Todos los hombres son mentirosos) were written in Spanish, and El regreso has not yet been published in English. Manguel has also written film criticism such as Bride of Frankenstein (1997) and collections of essays such as Into the Looking Glass Wood (1998). In 2007, Manguel was selected to be that year's annual lecturer for the prestigious Massey Lectures. For over twenty years, Manguel has edited a number of literary anthologies on a variety of themes or genres ranging from erotica and gay stories to fantastic literature and mysteries. Career Manguel was born to Pablo and Rosalia Manguel, both Jewish. He spent his first years in Israel where his father Pablo was the Argentine ambassador, returning to his native country at the age of seven. Later, in Buenos Aires, when Manguel was still a teenager, he met the writer Jorge Luis Borges, a customer of the Pygmalion Anglo-German bookshop in Buenos Aires where Manguel worked after school. As Borges was almost blind, he would ask others to read out loud for him, and Manguel became one of Borges' readers, several times a week from 1964 to 1968. In Buenos Aires, Manguel attended the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires from 1961 to 1966; among his teachers were notable Argentinian intellectuals such as the historian Alberto Salas, the Cervantes scholar Isaias Lerner and the literary critic Enrique Pezzoni. Manguel did one year (1967) at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Filosof√≠a y Letras, but he abandoned his studies and started working at the recently founded Editorial Galerna of Guillermo Schavelzon (who thirty-five years later, now established in Barcelona, was to become Manguel's literary agent). In 1969 Manguel travelled to Europe and worked as a reader for various publishing companies: Deno√´l, Gallimard and Les Lettres Nouvelles in Paris, and Calder & Boyars in London. =1970s= In 1971, Manguel, living then in Paris and London, was awarded the Premio La Naci√≥n (Buenos Aires) for a collection of short stories. The prize was shared with the writer Bernardo Schiavetta. In 1972 Manguel returned to Buenos Aires and worked for a year as a reporter for the newspaper La Naci√≥n. In 1974, he was offered employment as foreign editor at the Franco Maria Ricci publishing company in Milan. Here he met Gianni Guadalupi and later, at Guadalupi's suggestion, wrote with him The Dictionary of Imaginary Places. The book is a travel guide to fantasy lands, islands, cities, and other locations from world literature, including Ruritania, Shangri-La, Xanadu, Atlantis, L. Frank Baum's Oz, Lewis Carroll's Wonderland, Thomas More's Utopia, Edwin Abbott's Flatland, C. S. Lewis' Narnia, and the realms of Francois Rabelais, Jonathan Swift, and J.R.R. Tolkien. In 1976, Manguel moved to Tahiti, where he worked as editor for Les √âditions du Pacifique until 1977. He then worked for the same company in Paris for one year. In 1978 Manguel settled in Milford, Surrey (England) and set up the short-lived Ram Publishing Company. In 1979, Manguel returned to Tahiti to work again for Les √âditions du Pacifique, this time until 1982. =1980s‚Äì1990s= In 1982 Manguel moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada and lived there (with a brief European period) until 2000. He has been a Canadian citizen ever since. Here Manguel contributed regularly to The Globe and Mail (Toronto), The Times Literary Supplement (London), The Village Voice (New York), The Washington Post, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian Review of Books, The New York Times and Svenska Dagbladet (Stockholm), and reviewed books and plays for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Manguel's early impression of Canada was that it was \\"...like one of those places whose existence we assume because of a name on a sign above a platform, glimpsed at as our train stops and then rushes on.\\" (from Passages: Welcome Home to Canada (2002), with preface by Rudyard Griffiths). As well, though, Manguel noted that \\"When I arrived in Canada, for the first time I felt I was living in a place where I could participate actively as a writer in the running of the state.\\"Alberto Manguel by Robert Birnbaum, The Morning News In 1983, he selected the stories for what is perhaps his best-known anthology Black Water: The Book of Fantastic Literature. His first novel, \\"News From a Foreign Country Came\\", won the McKitterick Prize in 1992. In 1997, Manguel translated into English The Anatomist, first novel of the Argentine writer Federico Andahazi. He was appointed as the Distinguished Visiting Writer in the Markin-Flanagan Distinguished Writers Program at the University of Calgary from 1997 to 1999. Manguel was the Opening Lecturer at the \\"Exile & Migration\\" Congress, Boston University, in June 1999, and the Times Literary Supplement lecturer in 1997. =2000s= Manguel at Fronteiras do Pensamento (Frontiers of Thought) in 2014 In 2000, Manguel moved to the Poitou-Charentes region of France, where he and his partner purchased and renovated a medieval presbytery. Among the renovations was an oak-panelled library to house Manguel's nearly 40,000 books.Alberto Manguel ‚Äì Speaking at his and David Mason's lecture \\"You Are What You Read\\" at Kingston WritersFest, on Sat. 28 Sep. 2013, in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. In September 2020, the collection was donated to the Centre for Research in the History of Reading in Lisbon, Portugal with Manguel as its head.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books/article-alberto-manguel-to- donate-40000-works-to-lisbons-centre-for-research/ Manguel held the C√°tedra Cort√°zar at the Universidad de Guadalajara, Mexico, in 2007 and the S. Fischer Chair at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin, in 2003. In 2007, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Li√®ge. Manguel delivered the 2007 Massey Lectures which were later published as The City of Words and in the same year delivered the Northrop Frye-Antonine Maillet Lecture in Moncton, New Brunswick. He was the Pratt Lecturer at Memorial University of Newfoundland, in 2003. In 2008, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris honoured Alberto Manguel as part of its 30th Anniversary Celebrations, by inviting him to set up a 3-month long program of lectures, film and round tables. He writes a regular column for Geist magazine. Manguel's book \\"History of Reading\\" was referenced as a source of inspiration to the Book of Sand film. He suffered a stroke in December 2013, and reflected on the experience in a 2014 op-ed in The New York Times. In December 2015 he was named director of the National Library in his native Argentina, replacing Horacio Gonz√°lez.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/argentina- alberto-manguel-national-library/article34966600/. He held the post from July 2016 to August 2018.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books/article- alberto-manguels-resignation-from-argentinas-national-library-spurs/  Personal life  He was married to Pauline Ann Brewer from 1975-1986, and their children are Alice Emily, Rachel Claire, and Rupert Tobias. Upon divorcing Brewer in 1987, Manguel began seeing his current partner Craig Stephenson.  Bibliography  =Novels= *News from a Foreign Country Came. New York: C.

The Sakarya River creates a webbing of estuaries in the province. Sakarya is located in the Marmara Region. Its adjacent provinces are Kocaeli to the west, Bilecik to the south, Bolu to the southeast, and D√ºzce to the east. The capital of Sakarya is Adapazarƒ±. The climate is oceanic due to its close proximity to the Black Sea. Sakarya is situated on the Ankara-Istanbul Highway. It is connected through both road and rail. Sakarya is serviced by Istanbul's Sabiha G√∂k√ßen International Airport. The current mayor of Sakarya is Ekrem Y√ºce as of 2019.https://www.sakarya.bel.tr/ (AKP). *Surface area: 482,109.70 hectares *Population: 1,029,650 (TUƒ∞K ‚Äì 2019)http://www.tuik.gov.tr/UstMenu.do?metod=temelist *City traffic plate number: 54 The city of Sakarya, one of the most important cities in Turkey for its rapid growth and development, is also attention worthy for its natural beauties and cultural richness. It is one of the paradise-like spots of the country with its sea, beaches, lakes, rivers, highlands, thermal springs along with traditional Ottoman lifestyle districts such as Taraklƒ± and Geyve, and historical relics inherited from the Byzantine and Ottoman eras that are worth witnessing. The Turks conquered the city of Sakarya in the 13th century. There was intensive immigration from Caucasia and the Balkans in the 18th and 19th centuries. The last massive immigration was in 1989. Thanks to the developing industry and being at a transportation crossroads, the city still receives domestic migration today. Sakarya is notable in the Marmara Region. The city of Sakarya is surrounded with the city of D√ºzce in the East, Bolu in the South East, Bilecik in the South, Kocaeli in the West and the Black Sea in the North. The city of Sakarya has 16 districts which are; Adapazarƒ±, Akyazƒ±, Arifiye, Erenler, Ferizli, Geyve, Hendek, Karap√ºr√ßek, Karasu, Kaynarca, Kocaali, Pamukova, Sapanca, Serdivan, S√∂ƒü√ºtl√º and Taraklƒ±. Historical Hanƒ±meli Mansion in Tarakli Sakarya Museum  Access  Sakarya is located at the intersection of all the important roads and railways. The D-100 (E-5) highway which has an important role on domestic and international transportation and passes through the city East-ward all along together with TEM highway and the D-25 highway in the direction of Bilecik are the main transportation axis of the city. Kƒ±nalƒ±-ƒ∞stanbul-Sakarya-Ankara highway which originates from Edirne has an important role in an international scale. In Kƒ±nalƒ±, one branch of the highway is connected to Greece while the other branch is connected to Bulgaria. These are the distances to some of the main cities from Sakarya: 797 km to Adana, 583 km to Antalya, 102 km to Bilecik, 158 km to Bursa, 188 km to Eski≈üehir, 148 km to ƒ∞stanbul, 933 km to Trabzon, 306 km to Ankara, 114 km to Bolu, 486 km to ƒ∞zmir, 79 km to D√ºzce, 708 km to Muƒüla, 179 km to Zonguldak and 37 km to Kocaeli. There are 7 railway stations throughout a 65 km railway inside the city limits. The railway which connects Istanbul to Ankara and other Anatolian cities passes through Sakarya. The distance of Sakarya to Istanbul by railway is 141 km and 436 km to Ankara. If you prefer to travel to Adapazarƒ± by air, the nearest airport is the Sabiha G√∂k√ßen Airport in Kurtk√∂y ‚Äì Istanbul and Istanbul Atat√ºrk Airport in Ye≈üilk√∂y.  City of Sakarya  Adapazarƒ± was a village named \\"Ada\\" in 1573, a sub-district in 1646, a village inside Akyazƒ± in 1658, administrative district of a qadi in 1692, and again a sub-district in 1742. The residency area had the status of a district for 117 years between 1837 and 1954 during the Ottoman and Republican eras. Adapazarƒ±, being a district of Kocaeli for many years, separated from Kocaeli and took the name \\"Sakarya\\" on June 22, 1954 by the law number 6419. After Adapazarƒ± took the name Sakarya as being the center of the districts Akyazƒ±, Geyve, Hendek and Karasu, on December 1, 1954 the first governor Nazƒ±m √úner began active duty with ceremonies.  Sakarya Metropolitan Municipality  While Adapazarƒ± was experiencing a rapid growth and great development in the center of Akova, the city had to face a great destruction during the great Marmara earthquake on August 17, 1999. 3891 residents lost their lives while 26,551 buildings collapsed and almost 100,000 people were left homeless. The city was trying to be reborn from its ashes with the help of state/people collaboration when Adapazarƒ± Municipality which was founded in 1868 gained the status of Metropolitan Municipality on March 6, 2000 by publication of the council of the ministers' enactment number 593 on the Official Journal. Already present Adapazarƒ± Mayor Aziz Duran was brought to Adapazarƒ± Metropolitan Mayor Office. With the legal amendments made in 2004 and 2008 the range and service area of the Metropolitan Municipality were extended. In 2008 legislation was passed to change the name of Adapazarƒ± Metropolitan Municipality to Sakarya Metropolitan Municipality to prevent confusion. Sakarya Metropolitan Municipality is in service with its 16 districts and more than 870,000 people. * Adapazarƒ± * Akyazƒ± * Arifiye * Erenler * Ferizli * Geyve * Hendek * Karap√ºr√ßek * Karasu * Kaynarca * Kocaali * Pamukova * Sapanca * Serdivan * S√∂ƒü√ºtl√º * Taraklƒ± See also *East Marmara Development Agency  References   External links  * Sakarya governor's official website * Sakarya municipality's official website * Cark Caddesi * Sakarya weather forecast information * Sakarya University homepage ","title":"Sakarya Province"},{"id":"961381","text":"People playing an arcade game An arcade cabinet, also known as an arcade/coin- op machine, is the housing within which an arcade game's electronic hardware resides. Most cabinets designed since the mid-1980s conform to the Japanese Amusement Machine Manufacturers Association (JAMMA) wiring standard. Some include additional connectors for features not included in the standard. Parts of an arcade cabinet Because arcade cabinets vary according to the games they were built for or contain, they may not possess all of the parts listed below: *A display output, on which the game is displayed. They may display either raster or vector graphics, raster being most common. Standard resolution is between 262.5 and 315 vertical lines, depending on the refresh rate (usually between 50 and 60 Hz). Slower refresh rates allow for better vertical resolution. Monitors may be oriented horizontally or vertically, depending on the game. Some games use more than one monitor. Some newer cabinets have monitors that can display high-definition video. *An audio output for sound effects and music, usually produced from a sound chip. *Printed circuit boards (PCB) or arcade system boards, the actual hardware upon which the game runs. Hidden within the cabinet. Some systems, such as the SNK Neo-Geo MVS, use a main board with game carts. Some main boards may hold multiple game carts as well. *A power supply to provide DC power to the arcade system boards and low voltage lighting for the coin slots and lighted buttons. *A marquee, a sign above the monitor displaying the game's title. They are often brightly colored and backlit. *A bezel, which is the border around the monitor. It may contain instructions or artwork. *A control panel, a level surface near the monitor, upon which the game's controls are arranged. Control panels sometimes have playing instructions. Players often pile their coins or tokens on the control panels of upright and cocktail cabinets. *Coin slots, coin returns and the coin box, which allow for the exchange of money or tokens. They are usually below the control panel. Very often, translucent red plastic buttons are placed in between the coin return and the coin slot. When they are pressed, a coin or token that has become jammed in the coin mechanism is returned to the player. See coin acceptor. In some arcades, the coin slot is replaced with a card reader that reads data from a game card bought from the arcade operator. The sides of the arcade cabinet are usually decorated with brightly coloured stickers or paint, representing the gameplay of their particular game. Types of cabinets There are many types of arcade cabinets, some being custom-made for a particular game; however, the most common are the upright, the cocktail or table, and the sit-down. =Upright cabinets= Upright cabinets Upright cabinets are the most common in North America. They are usually made of wood and metal, about six feet or two meters tall, with the control panel set perpendicular to the monitor at slightly above waist level. The monitor is housed inside the cabinet, at approximately eye level. The marquee is above it, and often overhangs it. Controls are most commonly a joystick for as many players as the game allows, plus action buttons and \\"player\\" buttons which serve the same purpose as the start button on console gamepads. Trackballs are sometimes used instead of joysticks, especially in games from the early 1980s. Spinners (knobs for turning, also called \\"paddle controls\\") are used to control game elements that move strictly horizontally or vertically, such as the paddles in Arkanoid and Pong. Games such as Robotron: 2084, Smash TV and Battlezone use double joysticks instead of action buttons. Some versions of the original Street Fighter had pressure- sensitive rubber pads instead of buttons. If an upright is housing a driving game, it may have a steering wheel and throttle pedal instead of a joystick and buttons. If the upright is housing a shooting game, it may have light guns attached to the front of the machine, via durable cables. Some arcade machines had the monitor placed at the bottom of the cabinet with a mirror mounted at around 45 degrees above the screen facing the player. This was done to save space, a large CRT monitor would otherwise poke out the back of the cabinet, and possibly to avoid eye strain from looking directly up-close at the monitor. To correct for the mirrored image, some games had an option to flip the video output using a dip switch setting. Other genres of game such as Guitar Freaks feature controllers resembling musical instruments. Upright cabinet shape designs varies from the simplest symmetric perpendicular boxes as with Star Trek to complicated asymmetric forms. Games are typically for one or two players; however, games such as Gauntlet feature as many as four sets of controls. = Cocktail or table cabinets= A cocktail cabinet. This style is sometimes referred to as Japanese or Aussie style. Cocktail cabinets are shaped like low, rectangular tables, with the controls usually set at either of the broad ends, or, though not as common, at the narrow ends, and the monitor inside the table, the screen facing upward. Two-player games housed in cocktails were usually alternant, each player taking turns. The monitor reverses its orientation (game software controlled) for each player, so the game display is properly oriented for each player. This requires special programming of the cocktail versions of the game (usually set by dip switches). The monitor's orientation is usually in player two's favour only in two-player games when it's player two's turn, and in player one's favour all other times. Simultaneous, 4 player games that are built as a cocktail include Warlords, and others. Cocktail cabinet versions were usually released alongside the upright version of the same game. They were relatively common in the 1980s, especially during the Golden Age of Arcade Games, but have since lost popularity. Their main advantage over upright cabinets was their smaller size, making them seem less obtrusive, although requiring more floor space (more so by having players seated at each end). The top of the table was covered with a piece of tempered glass, making it convenient to set drinks on (hence the name), and they were often seen in bars and pubs. =Candy cabinets= A candy cabinet Owing to the resemblance of the plastic to hard candy, they are often known as \\"candy cabinets\\", by both arcade enthusiasts and by people in the industry. They are also generally easier to clean and move than upright cabinets, but usually just as heavy as most have 29\\" screens, as opposed to 20\\"-25\\". They are positioned so that the player can sit down on a chair or stool and play for extended periods. SNK sold many Neo-Geo MVS cabinets in this configuration, though most arcade games made in Japan that only use a joystick and buttons will come in a sit-down cabinet variety. In Japanese arcades, this type of cabinet is generally more prevalent than the upright kind, and they are usually lined up in uniform-looking rows. A variant of this, often referred to as \\"versus-style\\" cabinets are designed to look like two cabinets facing each other, with two monitors and separate controls allowing two players to fight each other without having to share the same monitor and control area. Some newer cabinets can emulate these \\"versus-style\\" cabinets through networking. =Deluxe cabinets= Deluxe cabinets. Most commonly used for games involving gambling, long stints of gaming, or vehicles, such as fighting games, flight simulators, and racing games. These cabinets typically have equipment resembling the controls of a vehicle (though some of them are merely large cabinets with fair features such as a great screen or chairs). Driving games may have a bucket seat, foot pedals, a stick shift, and even an ignition, while flight simulators may have a flight yoke or joystick, and motorcycle games handle bars and a seat shaped like a full-size bike. Often, these cabinets are arranged side-by-side, to allow players to compete together. Some of these cabinets are very elaborate, and include hydraulics which move the player according to the action on screen. Sega is among the biggest manufacturers of these kinds of cabinets, while Namco released Ridge Racer Full Scale, in which the player sat in a full size Mazda MX-5 road car. =Cockpit and environmental cabinets= These are close relatives to deluxe cabinets except the player sits inside the game itself. Examples of this can be seen on the Killer List of Videogames for games such as Star Wars, Sinistar or Discs of Tron. =Mini cabinets= The mini or cabaret is a squatter version of the upright cabinet. It may also have a smaller monitor. Mini cabinets spare bulk and are easier for small children to play than some full-size cabinets. =Countertop cabinets= Countertop or bartop cabinets are usually only large enough to house their monitors and control panels. They are often used for trivia and gambling-type games, and are usually found installed on bars or tables in pubs and restaurants. These cabinets often have touchscreen controls instead of traditional push-button controls. They are also fairly popular with home use, as they can be placed upon a table or countertop. = Large-scale satellite machines = Usually found in Japan, these machines have multiple screens interconnected to one system, sometimes with one big screen in the middle. These also often feature the dispension of different type of cards, either a smartcard in order to save stats and progress, or trading cards used in the game. Restoration Since arcade games are becoming increasingly popular as collectibles, an entire niche industry has sprung up focused on arcade cabinet restoration. There are many websites (both commercial and hobbyist) and newsgroups devoted to arcade cabinet restoration. They are full of tips and advice on restoring games to mint condition. =Artwork= Often game cabinets were used to host a variety of games. Often after the cabinet's initial game was removed and replaced with another, the cabinet's side art was painted over (usually black) so that the cabinet would not misrepresent the game contained within. The side art was also painted over to hide damaged or faded artwork. Of course, hobbyists prefer cabinets with original artwork in the best possible condition. Since machines with good quality art are hard to find, one of the first tasks is stripping any old artwork or paint from the cabinet. This is done with conventional chemical paint strippers or by sanding (preferences vary). Normally artwork cannot be preserved that has been painted over and is removed with any covering paint. New paint can be applied in any manner preferred (roller, brush, spray). Paint used is often just conventional paint with a finish matching the cabinet's original paint. Many games had artwork which was silkscreened directly on the cabinets. Others used large decals for the side art. Some manufacturers produce replication artwork for popular classic games‚Äîeach varying in quality. This side art can be applied over the new paint after it has dried. These appliques can be very large and must be carefully applied to avoid bubbles or wrinkles from developing. Spraying the surface with a slightly soapy water solution allows the artwork to be quickly repositioned if wrinkles or bubbles develop like in window tinting applications. =Control panels, bezels, marquees= Acquiring these pieces is harder than installing them. Many hobbyists trade these items via newsgroups or sites such as eBay (the same is true for side art). As with side art, some replication art shops also produce replication artwork for these pieces that is indistinguishable from original. Some even surpass the originals in quality. Once these pieces are acquired, they usually snap right into place. If the controls are worn and need replacing, if the game is popular, they can be easily obtained. Rarer game controls are harder to come by, but some shops stock replacement controls for classic arcade games. Some shops manufacture controls that are more robust than originals and fit a variety of machines. Installing them takes some experimentation for novices, but are usually not too difficult to place. =Monitors= While both use the same basic type of tube, raster monitors are easier to service than vector monitors, as the support circuitry is very similar to that which is used in CRT televisions and computer monitors, and is typically easy to adjust for color and brightness. On the other hand, vector monitors can be challenging or very costly to service, and some can no longer be repaired due to certain parts having been discontinued years ago. Even finding a drop-in replacement for a vector monitor is a challenge today, as few were produced after their heyday in the early 1980s. CRT replacement is possible, however, but the process of transferring the deflection yoke and other parts from one tube neck to the other also means a long process of positioning and adjusting the parts on the CRT for proper performance, a job that may prove to be too challenging for the typical amateur arcade collector. On the other hand, it may be possible to retrofit other monitor technologies to emulate vector graphics. Some electronic components are stressed by the hot, cramped conditions inside a cabinet. Electrolytic capacitors dry out over time, and if a classic arcade cabinet is still using its original components, they may be near the end of their service life. A common step in refurbishing vintage electronics (of all types) is \\"recapping\\" - i.e., replacing certain capacitors (and other parts) to restore, or ensure the continued safe operation of the monitor and power supplies. Because of the capacity and voltage ratings of these parts, it can be dangerous if not done properly, and should only be attempted by experienced hobbyists or professionals. If a monitor is broken, it may be easier to just source a drop-in replacement through coin-op machine distributors or parts suppliers. =Wiring= If a cabinet needs rewiring, some wiring kits are available over the Internet. An experienced hobbyist can usually solve most wiring problems through trial and error. Many cabinets are converted to be used to host a game other than the original. In these cases, if both games conform to the JAMMA standard, the process is simple. Other conversions can be more difficult, but some manufacturers such as Nintendo have produced kits to ease the conversion process (Nintendo manufactured kits to convert a cabinet from Classic wiring to VS. wiring).

The major cation in endolymph is potassium, with the values of sodium and potassium concentration in the endolymph being 0.91 mM and 154 mM, respectively. It is also called Scarpa's fluid, after Antonio Scarpa. Structure The inner ear has two parts: the bony labyrinth and the membranous labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth is contained within the bony labyrinth, and within the membranous labyrinth is a fluid called endolymph. Between the outer wall of the membranous labyrinth and the wall of the bony labyrinth is the location of perilymph. =Composition= Perilymph and endolymph have unique ionic compositions suited to their functions in regulating electrochemical impulses of hair cells. The electric potential of endolymph is ~80-90 mV more positive than perilymph due to a higher concentration of K compared to Na. The main component of this unique extracellular fluid is potassium, which is secreted from the stria vascularis. The high potassium content of the endolymph means that potassium, not sodium, is carried as the de-polarizing electric current in the hair cells. This is known as the mechano-electric transduction (MET) current. Endolymph has a high positive potential (80‚Äì120 mV in the cochlea), relative to other nearby fluids such as perilymph, due to its high concentration of positively charged ions. It is mainly this electrical potential difference that allows potassium ions to flow into the hair cells during mechanical stimulation of the hair bundle. Because the hair cells are at a negative potential of about -50 mV, the potential difference from endolymph to hair cell is on the order of 150 mV, which is the largest electrical potential difference found in the body. Function * Hearing: Cochlear duct: fluid waves in the endolymph of the cochlear duct stimulate the receptor cells, which in turn translate their movement into nerve impulses that the brain perceives as sound. * Balance: Semicircular canals: angular acceleration of the endolymph in the semicircular canals stimulate the vestibular receptors of the endolymph. The semicircular canals of both inner ears act in concert to coordinate balance. Clinical significance Disruption of the endolymph due to jerky movements (like spinning around or driving over bumps while riding in a car) can cause motion sickness.What makes people dizzy when they spin? A condition where the volume of the endolymph is greatly enlarged is called endolymphatic hydrops and has been linked to M√©ni√®re's disease.

He was previously a member of the Manitoba legislature, and a cabinet minister in the New Democratic government of Greg Selinger. Born in Norway House, Manitoba, he was placed in a residential school at the age of five. Robinson is a member of the Cross Lake First Nation, covered under Treaty 5. Robinson worked at a variety of jobs including dishwasher in Churchill, an addiction counsellor in British Columbia and a radio disc jockey. He has been active in Aboriginal issues for several years, and has worked for the Assembly of First Nations and the Brotherhood of Indian Nations, as well as other organizations promoting native rights within Canada. Before entering provincial politics, Robinson was also a producer and broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and worked for Native Communications Incorporated. In 1985, he co-authored a work entitled Infested Blanket, an historical indictment of the Canadian government's past dealings with Aboriginal peoples. Robinson entered provincial politics on September 21, 1993, winning a by-election in the northern riding of Rupertsland (he replaced Elijah Harper in the assembly). Running for the NDP, Robinson received 1697 votes; his closest opponent, Liberal George Munroe, received 1023. Robinson was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 1995, and served as the NDP's critic for Aboriginal and Northern Affairs. Also in 1995, he supported Lorne Nystrom for leader of the federal New Democratic Party. After the NDP won a majority government in the 1999 election, Premier Gary Doer named Robinson Minister of Aboriginal and Northern Affairs with responsibility for the Communities Economic Development Fund on October 5, 1999. Following a cabinet shuffle on September 25, 2002, he became Minister of Culture, Heritage and Tourism with responsibility for Sport. In 2003, Robinson supported Bill Blaikie's campaign to become leader of the federal NDP. In the 2003 provincial election, Robinson was re-elected with over 86% of the vote in his riding. He was returned again in the 2007 election. In 2007, he was reassigned as Minister of Culture, Heritage, Tourism and Sport.

History and geography R√∂tteln Castle near L√∂rrach The name translates to Margraves' Land, in reference to the Margraves of Baden. They ruled the area from the 12th century as a margraviate of the Holy Roman Empire until its elevation to the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1806, following the Empire's dissolution. Markgr√§flerland is the combination of three lordships: Badenweiler, R√∂tteln and Sausenburg. In 1556 the Markgraf (Margrave) became Protestant following the actions of the German monk Martin Luther. The river Rhine marks the frontier to France in the west and Switzerland in the south. Markgr√§flerland is considered to be part of the transnational metropolitan area that includes Freiburg, Basel, and Mulhouse. This region of Germany, also called the Dreil√§ndereck (three-country corner), includes many towns, but it is generally accepted that the center of the region is the town of M√ºllheim. Historically the region was a bit smaller, only reaching to Heitersheim in the north. The largest mountain in the region, the Blauen, lies on the outside border. Viticulture Aerial view of vineyards in Markgr√§flerland The region is known for its vineyards. A unique grape variety is the Gutedel grape, also known as Chasselas, which probably made its way into the region in 1780 from Vevey in Switzerland; this grape is also used in some of the viticulture on the northern shore of Lake Constance. Other popular varieties in the region include M√ºller-Thurgau, Grau Burgunder (Pinot gris), Weiss Burgunder (Pinot blanc), Sp√§tburgunder (Pinot noir) and Weissherbst. Other agricultural products include Spargel (white asparagus) and cherries. The region is often called by Germans the Tuscany of Germany, referring to the Tuscan region of Italy, due in part to its climate, milder than the rest of the nation. Language This region is home to the German dialect known as Alemannisch. The most famous writer of Alemannisch literature is Johann Peter Hebel. Cities and towns Location of the Markgr√§flerland region in Germany Markgr√§flerland includes (among others) the following locations: Auggen, Badenweiler, Ballrechten-Dottingen, Betberg, Binzen, Bollschweil, Britzingen, Buggingen, Dattingen, Dossenbach, Efringen-Kirchen, Eimeldingen, Gersbach, Hach, Hartheim am Rhein, Hammerstein, Hausen im Wiesental, Heitersheim, H√ºgelheim, Inzlingen, Kandern, Kleinkems, L√∂rrach, Malsburg, Marzell, M√ºllheim, Neuenburg, Neuenweg, Riedlingen, Schliengen, Schopfheim, Seefelden, Steinen, Sulzburg, Tegernau, V√∂gisheim, Weil am Rhein, Wies, Wieslet, Weitenau, Wollbach.

He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes a large swath of West Texas, including Lubbock and Abilene. According to a 2011 survey by the National Journal, Neugebauer was \\"the most conservative\\" member of the House. On September 17, 2015, Neugebauer announced he would not seek reelection to an eighth term in 2016. Early life, education and career Neugebauer was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and reared in Lubbock. His father was an insurance salesman and his mother a real estate agent and interior designer. He has two brothers, Jon and Bradley, and a sister, Virginia Volpe.Lubbock Avalanche Journal, Kathleene H. Smith Obituary, September 21, 2008. When Randy was nine years old, his parents divorced, and his father died in 1985 after remarrying. In 1963, his mother married Joe W. Smith, a bank manager.Abilene Reporter News, Neugebauers mother dies in Abilene, September 19, 2008. Neugebauer graduated from Coronado High School and later from Texas Tech University in 1972 with a Bachelor of Business Administration in accounting from the College of Business Administration (now Rawls College of Business). Like his mother, Neugebauer has long been involved in the real estate business, having served as president of the development company Lubbock Land before his election to Congress. He is a former president of the Texas Association of Builders from 1996 to 1997. Early political career From 1992 to 1998, Neugebauer was a Lubbock city councilman. He was mayor pro tempore from 1994 to 1996. While involved in Lubbock government, Neugebauer worked to reduce taxes and to privatize municipal services.

While immediate inquiries began to determine who shouted the words, more than 12 hours later, on March 22, 2010, Neugebauer publicly identified himself as the person, apologized for the incident and argued that his words were \\"It's a baby killer\\", referring to the bill, not Stupak himself. However, reporters and others in the room insisted Neugebauer precisely shouted \\"Baby killer!\\", referring to Stupak.CQ Politics, March 22, 2010, Trail Mix Stupak said that he does not \\"buy\\" Neugebauer's description of the outburst, said his words were \\"very clear\\", and believes Neugebauer should apologize for his remark on the floor of the US House. In contrast to Neugebauer's \\"baby killer\\" comment, Stupak and the Politifact watchdog group agree, \\"there will be no public funding of abortion in this legislation\\" that Neugebauer detests. The New York Times and Colorado Springs Gazette have compared Neugebauer's comment to Joe Wilson shouting \\"You lie!\\" during President Barack Obama's September 2009 address to Congress, and to racial and sexual slurs said to have been shouted at Democratic legislators outside the Capitol building by members of the public who opposed the bill during the 48 hours preceding Neugebauer's March 21, 2010, outburst. Neugebauer's comment was covered by media worldwide, including Canada's Macleans magazine, the United Kingdom's The Times, and Australia's Sydney Morning Herald. =Legislation sponsored= Neugebauer has sponsored the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 1155; 113th Congress) (), a bill meant to reduce the regulatory costs of complying with multiple states' requirements for insurance companies, making it easier for the same corporation to operate in multiple states. The bill would transform the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) into a clearing house that set up its own standards that insurance companies would be required to meet in order to do business in other states. In this new system, however, the insurance company would only have to meet the requirements of their home state and the NARAB (only two entities), not their home state and every other state they wished to operate in (multiple entities). Proponents of the bill argued that it would help lower costs for insurance companies and make insurance cheaper for people to buy. It passed the House on September 10, 2013. On April 26, 2013, Neugebauer introduced the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act Reauthorization of 2014 (H.R. 1786; 113th Congress), a bill that would reauthorize the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP), which was created to improve the understanding of windstorms and their impacts and to develop measures to reduce the damage they cause. =National World War II Memorial confrontation= On October 2, 2013, during the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, Neugebauer publicly scolded a National Park Service ranger who was enforcing the agency's closure of the National World War II Memorial due to the lapse in appropriations. His actions were widely criticized in the media,Bad Behavior in Washington, Editorial Board, Kansas City Star, October 4, 2013.Arguing with the Public Is Not a Good Look for GOP Congressmen, Dashiell Bennett, The Atlantic Monthly, October 3, 2013.Shutdown Showdown, Brandon Watson, Austin Chronicle, October 3, 2013.Lawmaker lambasted for his rant at ranger, Trish Choate, Wichita Falls Times Record News, October 4, 2013.GOP Congressman Makes Park Ranger Apologize for Shutdown, Neetzan Zimmerman, Gawker.com, October 3, 2013; accessed October 7, 2013.Congressman Confronts Park Ranger Over Closed WWII Memorial, Mark Segraves, October 3, 2013, 4 NBC Washington; accessed October 7, 2013. and he has responded that the phrase \\"The Park Service should be ashamed of themselves\\" was taken out of context.Texas congressman says 'beef' wasn't with ranger, Associated Press, Midland Reporter-Telegram, October 4, 2013. Political campaigns Neugebauer was elected to Congress after a hotly contested special election runoff in the spring of 2003. The seat came open after 18-year Republican incumbent Larry Combest announced his retirement not long after having been reelected to a 10th term in 2002. Although Combest had been the only Republican ever to represent this district, the 19th has long been one of the most conservative areas of Texas (indeed, in the entire nation), and it was virtually taken for granted that Combest would be succeeded by another Republican. The 19th has not supported a Democrat for president since 1964, and Combest's first bid for the seat was the only time in the previous two decades that a Democrat won more than 40 percent of the vote. Neugebauer was one of seven candidates to run in the primary, all Republicans, though the district was so heavily Republican that any Democratic candidate would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. Neugebauer stressed his conservative credentials; he described himself as a \\"pro-family, pro-life Christian who has a personal relationship with Jesus Christ\\" and believed that \\"our region's most precious resources are our values.\\"Archive of Neugebauer's campaign site Neugebauer led the primary field, but finished well short of a majority. He was forced into a runoff with Mike Conaway of Midland, the chairman of the Texas Board of Public Accountancy and a friend of President George W. Bush. In a close third-place finish in the first round of balloting was then-State Representative Carl Isett of Lubbock. In the runoff election, Neugebauer defeated Conaway by only 587 votes, becoming only the fourth person to represent the 19th since its creation in 1935. Soon afterward in 2004, Conaway won election to Congress in the newly reconfigured 11th District. Neugebauer ran for a full term in 2004, facing 26-year incumbent Democrat Charles Stenholm of Abilene. Stenholm had previously represented the Abilene-based 17th District, but that district had been dismantled in the 2003 Texas redistricting. The largest chunk of Stenholm's former territory, including most of Abilene, was thrown into Neugebauer's district. Although Stenholm had more seniority, the new district retained about 60 percent of Neugebauer's former territory, a disadvantage Stenholm was unable to overcome despite his seniority. Neugebauer won by 18 points, and was reelected four more times with little substantive opposition, each time taking well over 60 percent of the vote. =2010= In the 2010 Texas House of Representatives election, Neugebauer supported the election of the conservative Jim Landtroop to the District 85 seat. Landtroop had worked in past Neugebauer campaigns and is a member of the congressman's campaign finance committee. Landtroop upset the Democratic incumbent Joseph P. Heflin of Crosbyton but was himself unseated after one term in a revised district by Republican Ken King of Canadian in Hemphill County. =2012= Neugebauer faced opposition in the May 29 Republican primary from Chris Winn, who resigned as the Lubbock County Republican chairman to enter the race. Neugebauer defeated Winn, 45,372 (74.3%) to 15,675 (25.7%). =2014= In December 2013, Chris Winn announced that he would again challenge Neugebauer in the Republican primary scheduled for March 4, 2014. A third Lubbock Republican also filed for the seat, Donald R. May, a retired retinal surgeon. Neugebauer easily won re-nomination to a seventh term in the House. He polled 39,584 votes (64.4 percent); May and Winn trailed with 14,486 votes (23.6 percent) and 7,422 (12.1 percent), respectively. =2017= Press reports indicated that Neugebauer was under consideration to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the incoming Trump Administration.. The job was ultimately given to Mick Mulvaney. =Campaign funding= During the first seven years of his political career, from 2003 to February 2010, he has raised $6.4 million, most of these funds coming from the oil and gas, real estate, commercial banking and crop production/processing industries, and leadership PACs. His largest corporate and association donors have been the National Auto Dealers Association, National Association of Home Builders, Quantum Energy Partners, the National Beer Wholesalers Association and the National Association of Realtors. Outspoken against abortion during Congress' debate on health care reform legislation, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, Neugebauer has received a total of $3,000 during his career from people and committees associated with pro-life groups.Levinthal, Dave (March 22, 2010). \\"Baby Killer' Yeller Randy Neugebauer Far From Abortion Opponents' Favorite Candidate\\", Center for Responsive Politics. Investigation In October 2015, the Campaign for Accountability asked the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate Neugebauer for allegations of bribery and illegal gratuity related to $8,000 given to Neugebauer by Pay Day Loan financers for his co- sponsorship of H.R.1121 - Responsible Consumer Financial Protection Regulations Act of 2011 which provided additional protection and lack of regulation to Pay Day Loan lenders.

Some characters and issues presented in this work were continued in Townshend's later opus The Boy Who Heard Music, first presented on The Who's album Endless Wire and then adapted as a rock musical. Psychoderelict is Townshend's most recent solo album to date. History Released in 1993, Psychoderelict is a rock opera conceived by Townshend in 1991 as the follow-up to The Iron Man, but despite having recorded several demos, a bicycle accident in September 1991 forced him to delay work on the album until his wrist was able to heal properly. It is structured more like a radio play than the more \\"traditional\\" rock operas Townshend had recorded both with The Who (Tommy, Quadrophenia and the unreleased Lifehouse album) and as a solo artist (White City and The Iron Man). The album's central character is Ray High (real name Raymond Highsmith), a 60s rock star who has dwindled and turned into an alcoholic recluse. Ray's manager, Rastus Knight, worried at the rocker's dwindling bank account, attempts unsuccessfully to talk him into recording new material. Rastus complains about it to radio pop-music reporter Ruth Streeting, an outspoken critic of Ray's. Ruth says she has an idea to \\"fire him up\\" and Rastus offers her a cut off the profits if she can do it. Ruth sends Ray a letter posing as a 15-year-old girl named Rosalind Nathan, who dreams of being a star. She includes in her letter an erotic Polaroid of herself lying naked on her mother's grave when she was 12. Ray responds to her immediately, calling the photograph \\"stunning\\" and telling her that they both \\"share complicated problems.\\" He offers to help her if she will keep it a secret. He and \\"Rosalind\\" exchange several letters, where Ray opens his heart about his insecurity, his life's past tragedies, and his insights into the relationships between the performers, the public, and the press. He sends her a tape of \\"Flame,\\" a song he wrote for his secret \\"Gridlife\\" project. In his last letter he talks about Ruth Streeting, calling her \\"symbolic of the entire establishment\\" and saying \\"her disgust is the greatest motivator of the artist in me.\\" He confesses that he has fallen in love with her. Ruth, now sleeping with Rastus, laughs about it while being spanked. Ruth publishes the photograph in her \\"porno pen-pal story,\\" calling Ray a slime ball who took advantage of a young fan's innocence to solicit the photograph and \\"test out his weird theories.\\" The resulting controversy drives the re-release of Ray's records to huge sales. Rastus is delighted. \\"Rosalind's\\" version of \\"Flame,\\" off of her new Ruth Streeting-produced album, becomes a huge hit. Ruth promotes Rosalind as a \\"brilliant songwriter\\" while keeping the real writer of the song a secret, even from Rastus. Ruth receives her cut of the profits, and Rastus is on seventh heaven, once again rolling in money. Ray, upset about Ruth's expos√©, confronts them both. Ruth accuses Ray of \\"manipulating\\" Rosalind. Rastus says it all worked out for the best, they're back in calculator country. Ray insists that he was helping Rosalyn deal with a problem. Ruth insists Rosalind never had a problem and all Ray did was \\"help her become a fucking star.\\" In a meeting with Ruth at a bar, Raymond springs the surprise that he has known all along that Ruth and Rosalind are one and the same. It is heavily implied that Ruth fakes being attracted to Ray so that she can manoeuvre him into writing new material. Ruth, littering her language with endearments, is now producing \\"Gridlife\\" album, which contains a sample of the Who's famous \\"Baba O'Riley.\\" At the end of the play, Ray says that \\"Gridlife\\" was a vision, not a fiction, and that the apocalypse it foresaw is near. He wonders what happened to peace, love, and \\"all that hippie shit.\\" Commentary The album is a critical, perhaps satirical look at Townshend's own life: the dedication of his music to Meher Baba's teachings, and his Lifehouse project, which closely resembles the Gridlife project the Ray High character is working on. The album also makes use of Townshend's earlier song \\"Who Are You\\" which is sampled on the track \\"Meher Baba M4 (Signal Box)\\". Only one single proper was released from the album: \\"English Boy\\", both non- dialogue and dialogue versions, was released with a variety of B-sides and non-album songs, including \\"Psycho Montage\\" (a collection of dialogue from the album) and \\"Electronic Wizardry\\" (written and recorded in 1970 as a potential track for The Who's unreleased Lifehouse album), as well as demos for \\"Flame\\" and \\"Early Morning Dreams\\". \\"Don't Try to Make Me Real\\", \\"Outlive the Dinosaur\\" and \\"Now and Then\\" were all issued to radio stations with dialogue excised. A previously unreleased track, \\"Uneasy Street\\", was later released on the 1996 Pete Townshend compilation The Best of Pete Townshend: Coolwalkingsmoothtalkingstraightsmokingfirestoking. After slow sales of the initial dialogue intense release, a \\"music only\\" version was issued, though sales and reviews were still disappointing. Fan reception was divided: some felt that Townshend's ideas were too pretentious even for him, while others have embraced it as the first worthy concept since Who's Next. To date, it remains the final Pete Townshend solo album of all-original material, although further compilations have surfaced. The Ray High character would resurface in 2005 as the central character in The Boy Who Heard Music, a novella written by Townshend for his Web site; and again the following year in Townshend's mini rock opera adaptation of that story, Wire & Glass. That mini-opera would become the centrepiece of The Who's comeback album Endless Wire. Meher Baba instrumentals There are four instrumental tracks which originated from Townshend's 1970‚Äì1971 synthesizer demos for The Who's album Who's Next. Some of these experiments were released as \\"Baba O'Riley\\" that year and as \\"Who Are You\\" in 1978. On Psychoderelict, the Meher Baba instrumentals appear in this order: *\\"Meher Baba M3\\": features a hypnotic synthesizer backing that may have been created specifically for this album. During this song, Ray High can be heard on a tape machine, listening through songs he had demoed as early as 1970 (an obvious allusion to Townshend trawling through his archives for Psychoderelict). *\\"Meher Baba M4 (Signal Box)\\": a heavier track that sounds similar to \\"Who Are You\\", though this song undoubtedly features overdubs recorded by the musicians Townshend employed for Psychoderelict. *\\"Meher Baba M5 (Vivaldi)\\": an upbeat arrangement which draws its inspiration from classical composer Vivaldi. *\\"Baba O'Riley (demo)\\": a demo recording of the classic Who track, this time with the \\"Irish jig\\" finale that would later feature a violin solo.

The southern terminus is I-75 exit 192 near Perrysburg. From the southern terminus to exit 14, I-475 is co-signed with US Route 23 (US 23), and is signed the north/south section of I-475. From exit 14 to the eastern (northernmost) terminus at I-75 exit 204 in central Toledo, (north of downtown), it is signed the east/west section of I-475. Although I-475 crosses I-80/I-90 (the Ohio Turnpike), there is no interchange and one must drive a couple of miles through surface streets between I-475 exit 6 and I-80/I-90 exit 59\\\\. I-475 is named the Rosa Parks Highway in honor of Rosa Parks, who had helped organize the Montgomery bus boycott. Route description I-475 is a half-beltway bypassing downtown Toledo on its western side as mostly a north‚Äìsouth segment and a largely east‚Äìwest segment on the north side of Toledo. It has almost a half-square shape on the map consisting of the top and left sides of the square. It is much less direct than its parent I-75 through Toledo; the entire route of I-475 uses to connect exits apart on I-75. I-475 parallels what was US 23 on its north‚Äìsouth segment (US 23 has been realigned to it); it has Ann Arbor, Michigan, as a control city northbound (via US 23) and Columbus and Dayton as control cities southbound; it reaches neither of the three cities. On its northern segment it parallels State Route 120 (SR 120) and has Toledo as a control city to the east. Rural when built, it has much suburban-style development along its route. It has no direct access to the Ohio Turnpike, access to which requires the use of either SR 2 to and from the west, I-75 to or from the east, or surface streets to US 20\\\\. History I-475 was opened in sections with the first opened in 1967 between US 20, at the current I‚Äì75 interchange near Perrysburg, and US 24, near Maumee. By 1969 the second portion opened between US 24 and US 23, near Sylvania. In this year the southern terminus was moved from US 20, near Perrysburg, to the southern interchange with I‚Äì75. The final section opened in 1971 and was between US 23 and I‚Äì75 near downtown Toledo. Between 2010 and 2012, the easternmost sections of I-475 were reconstructed. This included the redevelopment of several overpasses, as well as the removal of an outdated interchange with Central Avenue in favor of an interchange with a newly constructed extension of ProMedica Parkway for easier access. Additional lanes were also added at the I-75/I-475 junction at I-475's eastern terminus. A single-point urban interchange was constructed in Sylvania Township at the US 20/SR 120 exit from July 2015 into November 2016. Beginning in October 2016, and ongoing as of November 2017, work began in Perrysburg on upgrading the interchange with SR 25 into a diverging diamond interchange.

I-475 is a bypass route that serves the downtown area of Flint while its parent, I-75, passes through the west side of the city. I-475 starts southwest of Grand Blanc and runs through suburbs of Flint before passing through downtown. There it intersects I-69 and crosses the Flint River. The freeway turns westerly to connect back to I-75 north of Flint near Mount Morris. This component freeway of the state trunkline highway system was planned in the 1950s and built in the 1970s. The trunkline was first named the Buick Freeway to honor David Dunbar Buick's contributions to Flint's early automotive industry as founder of Buick Motor Company. I-475 was renamed in 1981 the UAW Freeway, honoring the United Auto Workers, a labor union which was active in Flint. At the same time, the name of I-69 in Flint was changed from the \\"Chevrolet Freeway\\" to the \\"Chevrolet-Buick Freeway\\". Since 2001, I-475 has borne both the UAW and Buick names officially. Route description I-475 starts at a partial interchange with I-75 in Grand Blanc Township, southwest of Grand Blanc. From this start at exit 111, the freeway proceeds northward through a suburban residential area next to a baseball field complex. As I-475 continues northward, it has an interchange with Hill Road near the Crestwood Memorial Gardens cemetery and several commercial properties. North of the Maple Road underpass, the freeway crosses into the suburb of Burton where it runs for about before crossing into the city of Flint. The freeway then curves around to the northeast near Thread Lake, crossing over Saginaw Street. I-475 follows the western shore of the lake as it turns northward to run into downtown Flint. South of the four-level stack interchange with I-69, I-475 crosses over a line of the Canadian National Railway. North of this interchange, the freeway runs more northwesterly as it skirts the eastern edge of downtown Flint. Near the campus of the University of Michigan-Flint, I-475 curves to run parallel to the Flint River before crossing it next to an industrial area. There is an interchange complex on the northwest side of the river that provides access to Stewart Avenue and M-54 (Dort Highway). I-475 then runs north and northwesterly parallel to a rail line operated by Lake State Railway.Lake State Railway to lease 53 miles of CSX track in Michigan Trains, February 26, 2019 North of Carpenter Road, the freeway exits the city of Flint and enters Genesee Township. The Interstate turns to the west to cross into Mount Morris Township before meeting an interchange for Saginaw Street. There is one more interchange for Clio Road before I-475 terminates at a full interchange at exit 125 on I-75 and US Highway 23 (US 23). I-475 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along I-475 were the 57,400 vehicles daily north of the I-69 interchange in Flint; the lowest counts were the 18,637 vehicles per day west of the Clio Road interchange. As an Interstate Highway, I-475 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History Planning map for Interstate freeways in Flint A freeway along the I-475 corridor was proposed in the 1950s. The 1955 Yellow Book, an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System, contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Flint area, including a loop route freeway near the downtown area. Designated as part of the Interstate Highway System in 1957, I-475 construction was funded by the federal government. I-475 was first opened to traffic in the early 1970s. The first section was built between I-75/US 10 northward to M-21/M-78. The second section was built from I-75/US 10/US 23 to BUS M-54 along the north side of town. These two sections were opened on November 9, 1973 and September 26, 1974 respectively. The final section was opened between them in 1981. Memorial highway designations I-475 has carried two different memorial highway designations in its history, the Buick Freeway and the UAW Freeway. David Dunbar Buick was a Scottish-born immigrant who moved to Detroit with his parents at the age of two in 1856‚Äì57. He quit school to supplement the family's income after his father's 1860 death. In the 1880s, he was a plumbing supplier in the Detroit area, inventing a process that created a cheaper white bathtub. Buick produced a method for permanently coating cast iron with vitreous enamel which allowed the production of \\"white\\" baths at lower cost. He later sold his plumbing business and the patents to American Standard. Using the profits from this sale, Buick started working on gasoline engines, and later automobiles. He eventually moved his operations from Detroit to the Flint Wagon Works. William Durant managed the fledgling Buick Manufacturing Company, making it the number one car-building company in the country by 1908. Durant later built on the foundation of Buick's company to create General Motors. In honor of Buick's contributions to Flint's manufacturing base, the Flint City Commission proposed naming I-475 after Buick. The freeway passed by the city's Buick plant and many of the employees would use the new freeway on their commutes to work. The Michigan Legislature passed Concurrent Resolution 22 in 1969 to add the name. The United Auto Workers (UAW) was founded in Detroit on August 26, 1935. The labor union struggled to gain members until the Flint Sit-Down Strike in 1937. The strike started on December 30, 1936, when workers at the Fisher Body Plant No. 1 stopped loading tool dies on the night shift, locking themselves into the plant. The dies were destined for shipment to plants where union activity was much weaker than the UAW-organized plants in Flint. On January 3, 1937, workers at the plant sat down on the job; Fisher Plant No. 2 later joined in the sit-down strike. The heat was shut off at the plants, and on January 11, food deliveries were stopped, sparking a riot. Governor Frank Murphy mobilized 4,000 National Guard troops to keep peace at the plants. A second riot occurred at Chevrolet Plant No. 4 on February 1. The National Guard troops surrounded the 12 striking plants in Flint, but the governor never ordered them into action. President Franklin D. Roosevelt encouraged the two parties to sit down once more, and an agreement was signed, recognizing the UAW in the 17 striking plants across the country. A local politician wanted to honor not just the automotive pioneers in Flint, but the workers that worked in the plants. Since the UAW came to maturity in Flint as a result of the strikes, it was the appropriate location for a memorial highway designation. In 1980, the Michigan Legislature passed House Concurrent Resolution 583, renaming Flint's east‚Äìwest freeway (I-69) the \\"Chevrolet‚ÄìBuick Freeway\\" and I-475 the \\"UAW Freeway\\". I-475 was dedicated with its new name on Labor Day, 1981. Public Act 142 of 2001 consolidated the memorial highway designations of the state. In passing this act, the Michigan Legislature expanded the Chevrolet‚ÄìBuick Freeway to encompass all of I-69 in Genesee County. The act also restored Buick's name to I-475. Future The Genesee County Board of Commissioners has proposed to MDOT that I-475 should be connected to US 23 in the southern part of Genesee County. The board approved a study to investigate the economic impact of such an extension. The study will also examine how such an extension will impact an existing intermodal transportation hub at Bishop International Airport and a rail terminal being built at the former Buick City complex. Proposals for the freeway connection have been around since the late 1990s, but was indefinitely postponed in 2011.

The area is set amid the fresh-water bodies that make Northern Ontario famous; the largest of which are Horn Lake to the Northwest, Pickerel Lake to the Northeast, Three Mile Lake to the Southeast, and the joined Doe and Little Doe Lakes to the Southwest. History The steamship Glenada moored in Burk's Fall in 1920. The area around Burk's Falls was first settled by loggers during the 1860s. At that time, the only access to the region was via the Magnetawan River from Georgian Bay, or through the forests of the unsurveyed townships, north of Bracebridge. After 1875 the Rosseau-Nipissing Colonization Road allowed access from Muskoka, to the south. In 1879 steamboat service was established to the foot of the falls, from the historic village of Magnetawan. Railway service came to Burk's Falls in 1886, with the opening of Northern and Pacific Junction Railway, absorbed by the Grand Trunk Railway in 1888. The Village of Burk's Falls was incorporated in 1890. La future √ârabli√®re a Micha√´l Y sera a L'Ouest ! A steamship transits the swing bridge at Burk's Falls.

The series' production team built a full-size mock gas station and coffee shop at the western entrance of the town for filming, causing confusion among visitors thinking Corner Gas and The Ruby were real establishments. The town's grain elevator was also repainted with the name \\"Dog River\\" as it appears in the background of many episodes of the series. For an episode which aired in early 2007, then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper stopped in Rouleau to play a cameo role in the television show Corner Gas. The buildings used as sets for the program were allowed to fall into disrepair after the show wrapped up production. They were purchased by an entrepreneur, Sylvain Senecal, who converted them into a museum and souvenir shop. The set was demolished in November 2016.

In the Challenger Deep, he and Lt. Don Walsh of the United States Navy were the first people to explore the deepest part of the world's ocean, and the deepest location on the surface of Earth's crust, the Mariana Trench, located in the western North Pacific Ocean. Family life Jacques Piccard was born in Brussels, Belgium, to Auguste Piccard, who was himself an adventurer and engineer. Jacques' father Auguste twice beat the record for reaching the highest altitude in a balloon, during 1931‚Äì1932. The Piccard family thus had the unique distinction of breaking world records for both the highest flight and the deepest dive. * Jules Piccard (professor of chemistry)  Auguste Piccard (physicist, aeronaut, balloonist, hydronaut) * Jacques Piccard (hydronaut)  Bertrand Piccard (aeronaut, balloonist)  Jean Felix Piccard (organic chemist, aeronaut, and balloonist)  Jeannette Piccard (wife of Jean Felix) (aeronaut and balloonist) * Don Piccard (balloonist) Jacques's father, who had already set altitude records in his balloon, started using the buoyancy technique used in balloons for developing a submersible vehicle, the bathyscaphe. Jacques initially started out his career by teaching economics at University of Geneva while continuing to help his father improve the bathyscaphe to demonstrate its potential for operating in deep waters. During that period Piccard also completed a diploma at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva. Together, Piccard and his father built three bathyscaphes between 1948 and 1955, which reached record depths of 4,600 feet and 10,000 feet (the last one was bought by the government). With this success, the younger Piccard abandoned economics to collaborate with his father on further improving the bathyscaphe and demonstrating its practicality for exploration and research. Jacques's son Bertrand Piccard is continuing his family traditions. He commanded the first non-stop balloon flight around the world in March 1999 and the first solar-powered place flight around the world in December 2009. Challenger Deep mission Don Walsh (left) and Jacques Piccard (centre), in the Bathyscaphe Trieste. Jacques sought financial help from the U.S. Navy, which at that time was exploring various ways of designing submarines for underwater research. Jacques was welcomed to the U.S. to demonstrate his bathyscaphe, now named the Trieste. Impressed by his designs, the U.S. Navy bought the vessel and hired Piccard as a consultant. Recognizing the strategic value of a workable submersible for submarine salvage and rescue, the Navy began testing the Trieste for greater depths. With his Trieste able to reach depths of 24,000 feet, Piccard and his colleagues planned on an even greater challenge‚Äîa voyage to the bottom of the sea. On 23 January 1960, Piccard and Lt. Don Walsh reached the floor of the Mariana Trench located in the western North Pacific Ocean. The depth of the descent was measured at 10,916 meters (35,813 feet); later, more accurate, measurements during 1995 found the Mariana Trench to be slightly less deep at 10,911 m (35,797 ft). The descent took almost five hours. The bathyscaphe carried no scientific equipment and no experiments were conducted; the mission's purpose was to prove that the depth could be reached. The descent progressed without incident until 30,000 feet, when the crew heard a loud crack. They continued the dive, however, finally touching down in \\"snuff- colored ooze\\" at 35,800 feet. When they reached the featureless seabed, they saw a flat fish as well as a new type of shrimp. Marine biologists later disputed their observations, claiming that no fish could survive the 17,000 psi pressure at such depths. Upon discovering cracks in the viewing windows, Piccard cut the voyage short. After only a 20-minute stay on the bottom, they began dumping ballast for their return to the surface, and the damaged vessel returned to its escort ships without incident in three hours and 15 minutes. The historic dive received worldwide attention, and Piccard wrote an account of it, Seven Miles Down, with Robert Deitz, a renowned geologist who had helped plan the mission. A planned return expedition, however, never occurred. The Trieste was expensive to maintain and operate. It was incapable of collecting samples and could not take photographs and so had little scientific data to show for its voyages. The original vessel was retired in 1961, although a rebuilt version later located the remains of two lost U.S. Navy nuclear submarines, the Thresher and the Scorpion. Grumman/Piccard PX-15 / Ben Franklin Ben Franklin mission On 14 July 1969, just two days before the Apollo 11 launch, the Ben Franklin, also known as the Grumman/Piccard PX-15 mesoscaphe, was towed to the high-velocity center of the Gulf Stream off the coast of Palm Beach, Florida. Once on site, the Ben Franklin with its six-man, international crew descended to 1,000 feet off of Riviera Beach, Florida and drifted 1,444 miles north with the current for more than four weeks, surfacing near Maine.Piccard 1971 Crew members of the Grumman/Piccard PX-15 / Ben Franklin The crew consisted of Jacques Piccard as the mission leader; Erwin Aebersold, another Swiss, as Piccard's handpicked pilot and main assistant to Piccard and project engineer during the Franklin's design and construction. Grumman selected a Navy submariner named Don Kazimir to be captain. The U.S. Navy Oceanographic Office sent Frank Busby to conduct a bottom survey along the drift track over the Continental Shelf and the Royal Navy sent Ken Haigh, an acoustic specialist, who studied underwater acoustics and performed sonic experiments up and down the water column throughout the mission. The sixth man was Chet May from NASA. His specialty was \\"man working in space\\". Wernher von Braun learned about the Franklin mission, visited the submarine in Palm Beach, and considered the mission a kind of analogue to a prolonged mission in space, such as on the forthcoming Skylab. He appointed May as a NASA observer to accompany the mission and study the effects of prolonged isolation on the human crew.Benson, Charles Dunlap and William David Compton.

Named for the American patriot and inventor who was one of the first to chart the Gulf Stream, the 50-foot Ben Franklin was built between 1966 and 1968 in Switzerland for Piccard and the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation. It has been restored and now resides in the Vancouver Maritime Museum in Vancouver, Canada.  Influence and distinctions  thumb Ambient artists Matt Ruhlmann and Celer collaboratively released an album called Mesoscaphe in 2008, dedicated to the voyage of the Ben Franklin. He was awarded the Howard N. Potts Medal in 1972. In 1981, Piccard became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

In most of his novels (more prominently in Vidas secas) he depicts the precarious situation of the poor inhabitants of the Brazilian sert√£o. Life Graciliano Ramos de Oliveira was born in the city of Quebrangulo, in the Brazilian state of Alagoas, on October 27, 1892, to Sebasti√£o Ramos de Oliveira and Maria Am√©lia Ramos. Graciliano was the oldest of the couple's 16 children.√Årvore geneal√≥gica de Graciliano Ramos He would spend most part of his childhood travelling through different cities of Northeast Brazil. After finishing high school in Macei√≥, he became a collaborator of the newspaper Jornal de Alagoas in 1909, where he published a sonnet called \\"C√©ptico\\" under the pen name Almeida Cunha, and some other texts under many different pseudonyms. He also published texts in the magazine O Malho, under the pen name Feliciano de Oliven√ßa, and founded a short-lived periodical named Echo Vi√ßosense in 1906. In 1914 he moved to Rio de Janeiro, but had to return to Alagoas in September 1915, in order to live with his father, who became a salesman in the city of Palmeira dos √çndios. Also in 1915, he married his first wife, Maria Augusta de Barros, having with her four children. Maria Augusta died in 1920, due to troubles during childbirth. In 1927, Ramos was elected mayor of Palmeira dos √çndios: he took office in 1928 and would abdicate his post in 1930. Mesmerized by the high literary quality of his prefecture reports, Augusto Frederico Schmidt would approach Ramos into publishing his first novel, Caet√©s, that Ramos started to write circa 1925. He would finish Caet√©s in 1930, but did not publish it until 1933. In 1928, he married his second wife, Helo√≠sa Leite de Medeiros, having with her four more children. From 1930 to 1936 he lived once again in Macei√≥. In 1934 he published the novel S√£o Bernardo, and in the following year, he was arrested due to alleged (but never confirmed) participation in the Communist uprising of 1935. (Graciliano wrote an account of his time in prison named Mem√≥rias do C√°rcere, published a few months after his death in 1953.) After being freed from prison, he publishes with the help of associates such as Jos√© Lins do Rego his most famous novel, Ang√∫stia. In 1938 he publishes Vidas Secas and moves definitely to Rio de Janeiro, where he became in 1945 a member of the Communist Party of Brazil. In the subsequent years, he travelled alongside his wife to countries such as France, Portugal, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Also in 1945 he published an account of his childhood years, named Inf√¢ncia. Beginning in 1952, Graciliano's health gradually began to decline. He was diagnosed with lung cancer and, after an unsuccessful surgery, died on March 20, 1953. His wife Helo√≠sa would die 46 years later, in Salvador, Bahia. Graciliano is survived by one daughter and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. =Religion= Graciliano described himself as an atheist, although he enjoyed reading the Bible.

It was named after Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, a leading statesman and historian of the English Civil War. The main thoroughfares are Wilson Boulevard (one-way westbound) and Clarendon Boulevard (one-way eastbound). Boundaries and geography Because of the local street network configuration, many of Clarendon's 40-45 blocks resemble triangles rather than squares. The precise dimensions of Clarendon are not defined, and several different sets of boundaries are often used. These include: * Arlington County's Clarendon sector plan area (bounded roughly by Cleveland Street, 11th Street, Kirkwood Street, 13th Street, Highland Street and Wilson Boulevard) * the boundaries of the civic associations comprising the Clarendon Alliance association (i.e. Ashton Heights, Clarendon-Courthouse, Lyon Park and Lyon Village, and bounded by Lee Highway, Veitch Street, Wilson Boulevard, Arlington Boulevard, Glebe Road, Wilson Boulevard, and Kirkwood Street) * the area unsuccessfully proposed to have been incorporated as a city in the 1930s * the boundaries of the Clarendon-Courthouse Civic Association (Wilson Boulevard, N. Courthouse Road, Arlington Boulevard, and N. 10th Street) The central geographic/cultural/economic features of Clarendon are the Clarendon Metro station (on the Orange and Silver lines of the Metrorail system at Wilson Boulevard and Highland Street), Market Common Clarendon and the Whole Foods Market at Clarendon Boulevard and Edgewood Street. As Clarendon's profile both as a popular destination and marketing location have increased, its informal boundaries have expanded west toward Virginia Square and east toward Courthouse, two adjacent Metro station areas. History Map from 1900 by Howell & Taylor, showing Clarendon in Arlington, VAFirst platted in 1900 at the top of a hill on the Georgetown-Falls Church Road (now Wilson Boulevard), Clarendon evolved into Arlington County's original \\"downtown\\" after the arrival of electric trolleys in 1896. During the early 20th century, two interurban trolley lines converged in Clarendon a short distance west of today's Clarendon Metro station (see Northern Virginia trolleys). One of these trolley lines traveled between Rosslyn and Clarendon along the present routes of Lynn Street, Fairfax Drive and Clarendon Boulevard to a station at the present intersection of Clarendon Boulevard and Washington Boulevard. Metrorail's Orange Line now closely follows this line's former route. The other line traveled from downtown Washington, crossed the Potomac River over the Highway Bridge and traveled along Washington Boulevard to reach the Clarendon station. Trolleys from both lines traveled between Clarendon, Ballston and Falls Church along the present routes of Fairfax Drive, I-66 and the Orange Line. Some of these trolleys traveled as far as the towns of Vienna and Fairfax. Like many other interurbans around the country, these lines were to remain in service until the mid-1930s, when they succumbed to the automobile and Depression-era economics. The village of Clarendon was named and dedicated March 31, 1900. In 1920, the same year in which Arlington County adopted its name, a movement to incorporate Clarendon as a town was defeated in the courts. Clarendon street scene (2013) Over time, Clarendon became Northern Virginia's retail center. Department stores including J.C. Penney and Sears opened stores in Clarendon, and other retailers extended west along Wilson Blvd and Fairfax Drive to Virginia Square (anchored by Kann's Department Store) and, farther west, the Parkington Shopping Center anchored by the Hecht Company, which was later enlarged and renamed as the Ballston Common Mall. American Legion War Memorial at intersection of Wilson Boulevard and Clarendon Boulevard in Clarendon (2008) Built in 1937, the Arlington Post Office is the first known federal building constructed in the county after the American Civil War that is not within a larger federally-owned property.(1) (2) Previously Arlington's mail was handled in Washington, D.C.. Lobby murals depicting scenes about Arlington history were painted by Auriel Bessemer in 1939. In 2000, it was named in honor of Joseph L. Fisher, former U.S. representative from Virginia's 10th district. The building is a designated Arlington County landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.(1) (2) and Accompanying photo (3) By early 1975, two Vietnamese grocery stores had been opened in Clarendon, and in ensuing years Clarendon came to be known as \\"Little Saigon\\". Many Vietnamese refugees immigrated to the Washington D.C., and Arlington, due to the proximity to the nation's capital, and existing social, family, and business connections. This neighborhood was home to commercial uses of Vietnamese grocery stores, restaurants, department stores, cafes, and entertainment to serve the large Vietnamese population. Business was attractive to Vietnamese immigrants in this neighborhood due to the depressed rents during the time of construction of the WMATA Clarendon metro station. Vietnamese restaurants adjacent to Clarendon Metro like Queen Bee, and Cafe Dalat, closed in the end of 2005 and Little Viet Garden closed at the end of 2008. Nam Viet is the only restaurant that remains in 2014. Since the opening of the Clarendon Metro station in December 1979, Clarendon has become well known for its eclectic mix of unique shops, trendy bars, and small restaurants. More recently, luxury apartments, office buildings and upscale chain stores have been constructed and gentrified the area, although some of the original businesses do remain. The former Sears store's parking lot and automotive department, briefly considered as a site for a Home Depot, was developed as a mixed residential/commercial project that now includes townhouses, luxury apartments, and national chain retail stores. At least a half dozen restaurants closed in 2016. Clarendon today Intersection of Wilson Boulevard and N. Highland Street in Clarendon, with Clarendon Metro Station entrance and Olmsted Building in background (2008) Clarendon is also host to several local and County-wide events each year, including Arlington's Neighborhood Day parade (held the second Saturday in May), the Mardi Gras parade and Tax Blues Night. The largest annual event, \\"Clarendon Day,\\" is held on a Saturday in mid-October and features four live music stages, local restaurant and coffee house booths, clothing, jewelry, antiques and collectibles sales, children's games and rides, an ice-cream eating contest and other local traditions. Additionally, each spring Clarendon is host to the Clarendon Cup, part of the Armed Forces Cycling Classic, one of the largest one-day professional and amateur bicycle races in the U.S. A farmers market at Clarendon's Central Park is held Wednesday afternoons from spring through mid- December and features organic produce, baked goods, plants and herbs, homemade soaps and other items for sale.

It is mostly middle-class residential, but like most of Arlington County has been experiencing an economic renaissance and is now home to many upscale dwellings and retail and service establishments that also serve the nearby Fairlington, Parkfairfax, Nauck and Long Branch Creek areas. Geography Shirlington lies in the valley of Four Mile Run, a tributary of the Potomac River. The land rises toward Fairlington in the south and Nauck in the north. The area is bounded by I-395 on the east except for a small section of the city of Alexandria that lies to the west of the interstate. The only structure in that section, the Shirlington Gateway office building, has an Arlington address and is usually considered a part of Shirlington. To the north and west, starting in the east, Shirlington is bordered by South Glebe Road, 24th Street South, South Shirlington Road, South Four Mile Run Drive, and South Walter Reed Drive. On the west and south, starting in the west, Shirlington is bounded by South Arlington Mill Drive, the Arlington County Environmental Services facility, and the west side of Park Shirlington Apartments. Most residential, commercial, and retail development lies south of Four Mile Run while the area to the northeast, which is sometimes considered part of neighboring Nauck, is more light industrial. History 1988 aerial photo of Shirlington Shirlington began when Joseph Cherner, automobile dealer and banker, established the Shirlington Corporation to build a shopping center for nearby Fairlington and Parkfairfax. He began with a site on which the first store opened in June 1944.

The property's owner and the county spurred the creation of a Shirlington Phased Development Site Plan (PDSP) and the associated Shirlington Design Guidelines. A conceptual design for the area was established and almost of new mixed-use development was envisioned. Emphasis was placed on making the area pedestrian friendly with automobile parking located behind the commercial buildings. This plan was approved by the Arlington County Board in 2001. The development, a public- private partnership between developer Federal Realty Investment Trust of Rockville, Maryland (the operator of several other regional town-center-like developments such as Bethesda Row, Pentagon Row, and Rockville Town Center) and the county, began in the mid-2000s. As the plan was implemented, South 28th Street was extended westward and a building to house both the Signature Theatre and the Shirlington Library was constructed.

Although the circle is named after Shirlington, roughly half of it is located in Alexandria. The circle resembles roundabout interchanges common in the United Kingdom and Ireland but rare in the US. The circle includes multiple access points including ramps (slip roads) to and from I-395 (Exit 6) both north and southbound as well as a reversible direction ramp that provides access to and from the reversible high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes that run in the center of I-395. Four surface streets intersect with the circle; going counterclockwise (in the direction of traffic) from the north, they are: * Shirlington Road, which forms the border between Arlington County and Alexandria to the north of I-395. (The road, however, enters Arlington County just to the north of the interchange.) * Campbell Avenue (formerly 28th Street South) in Arlington County. * Quaker Lane (State Route 402), which forms the border between Arlington County and Alexandria to the south of I-395. * Gunston Road in Alexandria. Traffic generally follows roundabout rules, i.e., traffic inside the circle has the right-of-way and traffic entering the circle must yield. However, there are also traffic lights and stop signs regulating traffic flow and the I-395 off-ramps enter the circle from the interior of the circle, requiring a left merge into the traffic circle. The current circle and traffic arrangement have existed since a 1969-1972 reconstruction of Shirley Highway which widened the previous circle to allow for access to the then-proposed the Four Mile Run Expressway.Scott M.

It has a population of and an area of 4,360.56 km¬≤. The Tararua District Council was created by the amalgamation of the Dannevirke Borough, Eketahuna County Council, Pahiatua Borough Council, Pahiatua County Council and Woodville District Council in the 1989 local government reforms. The district's northwest boundary runs along the top of the Ruahine Range; its south-east boundary is the Pacific Ocean. The catchment of the Manawatu River generally defines the north and south extremities. The catchment is also the reason the majority of the district is in the Manawat≈´-Whanganui Region, although traditionally many of the people of the district regard themselves as living in either Hawke's Bay (in the north) or Wairarapa (in the south).  Towns and regional government  The district's chief town is Dannevirke, settled by immigrants from Denmark in the 19th century. It is also the centre for a Community Board. Other towns (from south to north along the main valleys) include Eketahuna and Pahiatua, which have their own Community Boards, and Woodville, Ormondville, and Norsewood. Near the coast are Pongaroa, Herbertville, ƒÄkitio, and Alfredton. While the vast majority (98.42% by land area) of Tararua District is part of the Manawatu-Wanganui Region, a small triangle of rural land (1.58% by land area) north of the Owahanga River in the southeast of the district is part of Wellington Region. According to the 2006 Census this area, known as Mara, has only 3 residents (down from 12 in 1996 and 2001). Demographics Tararua District had a population of 17,943 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,089 people (6.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 309 people (1.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 6,996 households. There were 8,916 males and 9,027 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.99 males per female. Of the total population, 3,876 people (21.6%) were aged up to 15 years, 2,883 (16.1%) were 15 to 29, 7,899 (44.0%) were 30 to 64, and 3,285 (18.3%) were 65 or older. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding. Ethnicities were 84.5% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 24.6% MƒÅori, 1.9% Pacific peoples, 2.7% Asian, and 1.4% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. The percentage of people born overseas was 8.7, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 49.6% had no religion, 36.7% were Christian, and 5.4% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 1,431 (10.2%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 3,897 (27.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $26,300. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 6,459 (45.9%) people were employed full-time, 2,298 (16.3%) were part-time, and 567 (4.0%) were unemployed.  \\"Forty-Mile Bush\\"  When Europeans settled the area, it was almost entirely forested and was called \\"Forty-Mile Bush\\". Industrious clearance has made it a busy pastoral district, although the region close to the Pacific coast is still sparsely populated. The original name lives on in that of the local National Provincial Championship rugby union team, Wairarapa-Bush.  Economy  Agriculture is the district's main industry. Other industries include textiles, food processing, and retailing. Commercial forestry is expected to become more important to the district's economy in the next few years.  Weather forecasts  Before 2006, weather forecasts on National Radio (as provided by MetService) had usually mentioned Hawke's Bay and Wairarapa but rarely if ever Tararua District, probably leaving Tararua District residents wondering which applied to them when the forecasts differed. Officially it is considered a sub-region of the Wairarapa district. Since early in 2006, Met Service policy is that a separate Tararua District forecast will be issued only if the expected weather in that area differs significantly from the other sub-regions (Masterton, Carterton, and South Wairarapa). However, by the time the forecast is actually broadcast over National Radio (at least until early March 2006), Tararua District is simply listed as a separate District if it is mentioned at all (commonly in the phrase \\"Tararua and Wairarapa\\"), and if it is mentioned separately or bracketed with other areas apart from Wairarapa there is no indication that the Wairarapa forecast excludes Tararua District.

He was the unsuccessful nominee of the Republican Party for Governor of Missouri in the 2008 election. Biography Hulshof was born in Sikeston, Missouri and is of Dutch, German, and Irish descent.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/hulshof.htm Hulshof attended the University of Missouri and earned his J.D. from the University of Mississippi School of Law. Prior to serving in Congress, Hulshof worked in the public defender's office and as a special prosecutor for the Missouri attorney general's office. As a special prosecutor, Hulshof was detailed to capital cases. In 1992, Hulshof sought to be nominated by the Boone County Republican Committee as a replacement for Prosecuting Attorney Joe Moseley, who had won election to a legislative seat and had to resign to take his new post. Hulshof was defeated by Kevin Crane. In 1994, the Ninth District Republican Committee selected Hulshof to replace University of Missouri political science professor Rick Hardy as GOP candidate for Congress. Despite a late start in the race, Hulshof captured 45% of the vote and nearly beat nine-term incumbent Democrat Harold Volkmer. The district had historically had a character similar to Yellow Dog Democrat districts in the South, but Volkmer was thought to be vulnerable after Hardy nearly unseated Volkmer in 1992 even as Bill Clinton easily carried the state. Hulshof immediately began preparing to challenge Volkmer again in 1996. Hulshof had to first win the Republican primary against Harry Eggleston. Hulshof won the primary by 168 out of 38,000 votes cast. During the general election, Volkmer attacked Hulshof as being a puppet of Newt Gingrich; Hulshof responded that Volkmer voted twenty times to raise taxes in twenty years. Hulshof won the election by a 49%‚Äì47% margin, becoming only the third Republican to win it since 1893. He would never face another contest anywhere near that close, and was reelected five more times, never dropping below 59 percent of the vote. Hulshof made known his desire to run for Governor of Missouri in 2004, but withdrew in favor of then-Secretary of State Matt Blunt, who won. Hulshof's voting record in the House was conservative. Among other issues, he voted against abortion and same-sex marriage, while supporting the death penalty and the Patriot Act.Kenny Hulshof voting record, ontheissues.org; accessed December 13, 2013. Hulshof is Roman Catholic, and is active in the St. Thomas More Newman Center on the campus of his alma mater, the University of Missouri. In 2005, Hulshof joined the all-Congressional band the Second Amendments, to play for U.S. troops stationed overseas during the period between Christmas and New Year's Eve. Hulshof played the drums. There had been rumors in Washington and back in Hulshof's district in Missouri that he might leave Congress to become the University of Missouri System president.\\"Hulshof going back to school\\" , stltoday.com; accessed December 13, 2013. Hulshof confirmed the rumors after his candidacy became common knowledge. However, the university's Board of Curators ended up voting to offer the position to another graduate, who declined the offer. The Board selected Gary D. Forsee for the President of the University of Missouri System in 2008. When Governor Blunt announced he would not be seeking re-election in 2008, Hulshof announced on January 29 that he would run for governor. Hulshof defeated State Treasurer Sarah Steelman in the Missouri Republican Gubernatorial primary, held on August 5, 2008, winning with a margin of 49% to 45%, with Scott Long receiving 5% and Jen Seivers 1%. Hulshof was defeated by four term Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon, the Democratic Nominee, in the General Election held on November 4, 2008.Profile, kmbc.com; accessed December 13, 2013. Hulshof now works for Kit Bond Strategies, based in St. Louis, Missouri. Court cases A 2008 Associated Press investigation found five cases where Hulshof was accused of prosecutorial misconduct, primarily withholding exculpatory evidence. At least two cases in which Hulshof served as prosecuting attorney have been overturned on judicial review and one case in which the judge set aside the conviction. In the first case Hulshof prosecuted Joshua Kezer for murder. He tried the case without physical evidence, DNA, fingerprints, a murder weapon, or any eyewitnesses. Kezer was convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison. Kezer was set free after a Cole County Circuit judge overturned the conviction. Hulshof publicly stated that he remained convinced of Kezer's guilt. The second case, overturned by the Missouri Supreme Court in January, 2013, involved the 1990 murder of a Livingston County woman in her home near Chillicothe. Mark Woodworth of Chillicothe, then 16 years old, was convicted in the shooting death of 40-year-old Cathy Robertson as well as the wounding of her husband. Hulshof, at the time an assistant Missouri Attorney General, was brought in as a special prosecutor in the original trial. On June 4, 2011, Hulshof was questioned regarding evidence in the Woodworth case. A special master determined that a series of letters written between the original trial judge and various prosecutors was not offered to Woodworth's defense attorneys. The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that there was a violation of the Brady v. Maryland evidence rules and overturned the conviction.

It is well known as part of the ski-region \\"Serfaus-Fiss-Ladis\\", which was formed when Serfaus teamed up with the two nearby municipalities of Fiss and Ladis in 1999. Serfaus is also known for its small hovertrain subway system, the Dorfbahn Serfaus. With four stations and a length of 1280 m (the second-shortest underground train line in the world) it allows for a complete ban of cars within the town, while at the same time maintaining the village's attractiveness to tourists, particularly skiers. Geography Serfaus is a small town located on a plateau 500m above the upper Inn valley in Tyrol, western Austria. Above the town a high ridge rises, linking Mount Furgler (3004 metres above sea level) with Mount Sch√∂njoch (2491m). On the opposite side of the valley is a 20 km-long ridge named Glockturmkamm with Pfroslkopf peak (3148m).  History  The oldest evidence of civilisation in the region of Serfaus dates from the Bronze Age. The remains of a 3200-year-old fireplace on the Komperdell, a nearby high alpine meadow, indicates that the area was used as a pasture or hunting ground. More archaeological research was undertaken at the \\"Zienerbichl\\" (a distinctive hill in the south-west of Serfaus), revealing traces of the period Late Antiquity and from the Middle Ages. Pre-Roman field names and some traces of the Celts bear witness to the early settlers of this region. Ancient historians described the area as Raetia and its inhabitants as Raeti. However, with the conquest of the area by the Romans in about 15 BC the Roman and Raetic cultures began to mix, creating the Romansh people. The Romansh language, which is still spoken in some parts of the Swiss Canton Graub√ºnden, has survived in many of the regional field names. In the 6th century the German-speaking Bavarii started to inhabit the plateau, gradually displacing Romansh from everyday communication. The village itself was first officially mentioned in the 11th century. The towns of See and Kappl in the Paznaun valley were partly settled via Serfaus. Up to 1891 See was also part of the rectory of Serfaus, which explains why there is still a graveyard for citizens of See in the village of Serfaus. Other important cultural landmarks include the pilgrimage church of St. Georgen. Built in the Middle Ages it is one of the oldest churches in the region. During the 19th century tourism started to flourish in Tyrol and after the Second World War tourism became the main source of income for the village. In 1942 fourteen houses were destroyed by a fire, which left 16 families (a total of 89 people) homeless and caused about 650,000 Reichsmarks worth of damage. The village was rebuilt after the Second World War, also allowing the new buildings more space in contrast to the old layout of a clustered Romansh village. To cope with the increased traffic due to growing tourism in the region, Serfaus banned private traffic in winter in the 1970s. For the transportation of guests (and especially skiers) a bus service was established. In order to provide an even quieter and more environmentally friendly means of transportation from the entrance of the town through to the cable-car station, the small underground train system, the Dorfbahn Serfaus went into operation in 1985. The use of the underground is free-of-charge and along its 1280m-long route it has four stops (Parkplatz, Kirche, Raika, Seilbahn) and can transport up to 1500 people per hour.  Demographics  As of January 2020, 1,139 people live in Serfaus. 88.3% are citizens of Austria. More than 90% of the population is Roman Catholic (statistics from 2019). Small minority religions are Protestantism, Eastern Orthodoxy and Islam.  Tourism  Serfaus main street As Serfaus is close to the Via Claudia Augusta and the Reschen Pass people are thought to have traveled through the area for hundreds of years. Moreover, the marian pilgrimage, which has been taking place since the Middle Ages, has caused some travel to and from the mountain village. The Theresian Cadasdre of 1776 lists Johannes Penz as having the \\"right to operate a tavern\\". By 1812 the inhabitants of Serfaus were asked to pay an extra tax for the lodging of foreigners in their taverns or private rooms. This shows that tourism was already present at these times, even if still only in its most basic form. Shortly after 1900 skiers started to discover the possibilities of the region and in 1912 plans were made to build a little ski hut on one of the high alpine meadows surrounding the village, the \\"K√∂lnerhaus\\" up at the \\"Komperdell\\". However, during the First World War and the following 1920s tourism developed very slowly. Tourism between the two world wars reached its peak in 1931/32 with 30,000 registered guests. As a result, the three taverns could not provide enough accommodation anymore and farmers started to rent out private rooms to guests in the region. Thus Serfaus had 150 registered beds in 1930. In 1940 a cable-car for transporting goods to the \\"K√∂lnerhaus\\" was installed and was turned into an aerial tramway seating five people in 1951. This caused a new increase of tourism in Serfaus and through the constant renewal and expansion of the infrastructure and the connection to the lifts of Fiss-Ladis the ski area now covers 190 km of pistes through 70 lifts. Today the town is one of the most popular ski and holiday areas in Tyrol.Klien, R., Tschuggmall, A., Klien, G.R. (2002) \\"Der Tourismus\\", in Klien, Robert, Serfaus, (Serfaus 2002), p. 445 - 461.

Estrella predicts \\"a death near water\\" for someone close to Angela. After leaving Estrella's booth, Jerry sees Estrella's sister Carmelita (Erina Enyo), a stripper who hypnotizes him with her icy stare, and he is compelled to see her act. Angela leaves the carnival, disgusted, with Harold in tow. After the show, Jerry is tricked backstage into Estrella's room with a note and she turns Jerry into a zombie by hypnotizing him with a spiraling wheel. Jerry then goes on a violent overnight rampage of which he will have no memory, killing Marge and fatally wounding Bill. The next day, Jerry attempts to strangle his girlfriend Angela as well. It develops that Estrella, with her henchman Ortega (Jack Brady), has been turning carnival patrons into zombies by throwing acid into their faces, disfiguring them, and then imprisoning them in her fortune-telling booth. Interspersed through the film are several song-and-dance production numbers in the carnival's nightclub, with songs like \\"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie\\" and \\"Shook Out of Shape.\\" Jerry, suspicious of his fragmented memory, confronts Estrella at the carnival. He is hypnotized a second time, and that night stabs a carnival showgirl and barker in the showgirl's home. Returning to Estrella, she throws acid in Jerry's face and attempts to imprison him, only to have her other zombies escape. The zombies immediately kill Estrella, Carmelita, Ortega and several performers before being shot by police. Jerry, himself partially disfigured but not completely a zombie, escapes the carnival and is pursued to the shoreline, where the police shoot him dead in front of Angela and Harold. Estrella's prediction of \\"a death near water\\" for someone close to Angela is fulfilled. Production and release = Title = At the time of release, The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies was the second longest titled film in the horror genre (Roger Corman's The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent being the first). This was not, however, the originally intended title of the film. As Steckler relates, the film was supposed to be titled The Incredibly Strange Creatures, or Why I Stopped Living and Became a Mixed-up Zombie, but was changed in response to Columbia Pictures' threat of a lawsuit over the name's similarity to Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, which was under production at the same time. Steckler later joked that he could have made 5 movies for what they probably spent on lawyers.Interview with Boyd Rice, Incredibly Strange Films, p51, RE/Search Publications, San Francisco 1986, The film was originally released by Fairway-International Pictures, Arch Hall, Sr.'s studio, who put it on a lower half of a double bill with one of his own pictures. Dissatisfied, Steckler bought the distribution rights back from Hall, purchased the rights to the Coleman Francis picture, The Beast of Yucca Flats and roadshowed the picture across the U.S. In order to get repeat customers, Steckler re-titled the film numerous times, with titles such as The Incredibly Mixed-Up Zombie, Diabolical Dr. Voodoo and The Teenage Psycho Meets Bloody Mary. = Studio = Much of the movie was filmed in an old, long-empty Masonic temple in Glendale, California, owned by actor Rock Hudson. The nine-story building was a series of makeshift \\"sound stages\\" stacked floor after floor, some big enough to create the midway scenes indoors. This was the studio that was used that year for production of The Creeping Terror, another low-quality monster movie. The Film Center Studios were popular with non-union producers, because they could turn off the elevator to lock out IATSE union agents, who found it difficult to climb the stairs to the seventh floor main stage. =Budget= During the filming of the movie, Steckler was in terrible need of funds, both for the movie and for rent, food and basic needs. Atlas King, who had grown close to Steckler, gave him three hundred dollars out of his own pocket. The station wagon Jerry drives in this movie was the Steckler family car. = Notable cast and crew = Brett O'Hara was usually a stand-in for Susan Hayward. Madame Estrella was the only \\"real\\" role of her career. Sharon Walsh was not originally meant to play Angela. Bonita Jade was given the role, but when it was time for her scene, she said she had to leave to meet her boyfriend, because he was performing and she always went to his gigs. Steckler was furious, and he pulled Walsh out of the chorus line, telling her she was now the female lead. Walsh had already appeared in several dance numbers during the movie and they had to \\"disguise\\" her with a new hairstyle. The cinematography/camera operating was done by three men who would go on to become major figures in cinematography: Joseph V. Mascelli, author of The Five Cs of Cinematography; Vilmos Zsigmond (listed as William Zsigmond), who won an Academy Award for his work on Close Encounters of the Third Kind; and L√°szl√≥ Kov√°cs (listed as Leslie Kovacs). In some screenings, employees in monster masks, sometimes including Steckler himself, would run into the theater to scare the audience (the gimmick was billed as \\"Hallucinogenic Hypnovision\\" on the film's posters).  Reception and legacy Boston theater in 1965 as the second film Ever since its release, many critics have cited it as the worst film ever made. The 2004 DVD The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made listed this film as the worst film of all time.The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made (Video 2004)-IMDb However, the film has since become a cult classic and has been celebrated by fans of camp or kitsch films. Leonard Maltin awarded the film two and a half out of a possible four stars (his most widely used rating), complimenting the film's use of colors and haunting atmosphere while criticizing the film's acting, dialogue, and simplistic plot. The rock critic Lester Bangs wrote an appreciative 1973 essay about Incredibly Strange Creatures in which he tries to explain and justify the movie's value: It currently has a 20% \\"Rotten\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The DVD release of Incredibly Strange Creatures features a commentary track by \\"drive-in movie critic\\" Joe Bob Briggs. A key group of the 1970s Melbourne post-punk little band scene named themselves after the film. The film was lampooned in 1997 by Mystery Science Theater 3000.

While Hideyoshi was on his deathbed, his son, Toyotomi Hideyori, was still only 5 years old and as such Hideyoshi needed to create the council in order to ensure his heir would be able to succeed him after coming of age. They also acted as advisers for the Five Commissioners (Japanese: ‰∫îÂ•âË°å Go- Bugy≈ç), which had also been established by Hideyoshi to govern Kyoto and the surrounding areas. Toyotomi Hideyoshi  Creation of the Council  = Leading up to the creation of the council = Hideyoshi had been slowly changing in demeanor as the invasions of Korea (in attempt to conquer both Korea and China) were failing. Hideyoshi himself had not joined the Korean Campaigns and assigned vassals in his command to head the campaign. He sent his final force of 140,000 to Korea in 1597, but the efforts were fruitless. Hideyoshi's execution of family members were also one of the reasons for questioning his sanity during this period. Before the birth of his son Hideyori, he had adopted his nephew, Toyotomi Hidetsugu, to be his heir in 1591 because Hidetsugu had helped Hideyoshi in his campaigns. Once Hideyori was born, he ordered Toyotomi Hidetsugu to commit ritual suicide on Mount K≈çya, this causing Hideyoshi's only possible heir to be his infant son Hideyori. The people closest to Hidetsugu, such as his family and retainers, were also put to death. In 1595 Toyotomi Hideyoshi officially announced five laws and ordinances (Japanese: Âæ°ÂÆö‰∫î„É∂Êù° Onkite Gokaj≈ç) to maintain the stability of the regime and overcome the upheaval of politics after the removal of Hidetsugu. On the \\"fifteenth day of the seventh month\\", the senior daimy≈ç under order gathered at Maeda Toshiie's residence in Fushimi to renew their pledge of loyalty to Hideyori. On the \\"fifth day of the eighth month\\", Hideyoshi issued an order to the Elders stating that children of various generals shall go to Osaka Castle, once Hideyori has moved there. Hideyoshi's health started to degenerate after falling ill in the later half of 1598. Realizing he would need to find a way to ensure the installation of his son as heir following his death, he called out to certain trusted daimy≈ç to grant his final request: There are also accounts that when Hideyoshi called upon Ieyasu to become a regent, he asked him to decide if Hideyori is fit to rule when he reaches a ripe age and that Ieyasu rejected this request. = Choosing the council = The members of the council were all daimy≈ç chosen due to their relation to the taik≈ç and the amount of power they held in the country. Hideyoshi chose powerful daimy≈ç to prevent authority being concentrated on a single daimy≈ç. Maeda Toshiie and Ukita Hideie were chosen due to their closeness with Hideyoshi as Maeda Toshiie was Hideyoshi's friend who had also served Oda Nobunaga. Maeda Toshiie was also chosen due to the respect he had from the Toyotomi family and Hideyoshi wanted to prevent Ieyasu from holding absolute power among the Five Elders. Ukita Hideie had been adopted under the name of Yuushi (Japanese:Áå∂Â≠ê) by Hideyoshi and his closeness with Hideyoshi also led him to be appointed as a member of the five elders. These daimy≈ç had also all served under Hideyoshi for many years in his house administration. Even before the creation of the council, Hideyoshi treated the five differently from other daimy≈ç. One of the reason was the absence of a Toritsugi (Japanese: ÂèñÊ¨°). Toritsugi acted as mediators that went between the daimy≈ç to help with the communication of orders. This allowed each daimy≈ç to talk directly to Hideyoshi, and it also meant that Hideyoshi would not intervene in the business of the daimy≈ç in ruling their own domain. For the Shimazu clan, Ishida Mitsunari was appointed as the toritsugi, which also meant that Mitsunari and/or Toyotomi had power to intervene in Shimazu‚Äôs domain. Hideyoshi expected the daimy≈ç under his control to govern their lands and serve military services. The larger the domains of the daimy≈ç were, the more experienced those daimy≈ç were at governing their lands and as such, Hideyoshi treated them differently compared to smaller daimy≈ç which needed Hideyoshi to intervene in local governance. In the 1588 Sword Hunt Policy (Japanese:ÂàÄÁã© katanagari), it is assumed that Hideyoshi only ordered to smaller class daimy≈ç to enforce the policy. The larger daimy≈ç followed even without orders, however Hideyoshi did not strictly expect them to enforce the policy. Initially the sword hunt was intended to confiscate weapons to restrict forces, ensuring that no one could take the country by force. Hideyoshi was able to rely on the large daimy≈ç that were experienced and equipped with large military forces to be able to suppress the local powers even if they were to rebel. In this way, Hideyoshi‚Äôs treatment of the larger daimy≈ç, Tokugawa, Maeda, Mori, and Uesugi, was exceptional. = Subgroups related to the council = Hideyoshi also appointed the Five Commissioners (Japanese: Go-Bugy≈ç) who were tasked to oversee the \\"basic business of the realm\\"; while the Elders were tasked to make sure that Hideyori would succeed Hideyoshi. During this time the Five Commissioners were Asano Nagamasa, Mashita Nagamori, Ishida Mitsunari, Natsuka Masaie and Maeda Gen'i. The Elders had assistants known as ch≈´ro (Japanese: ‰∏≠ËÄÅ) who acted as mediators, the Five Elders and the Five Commissioners. The ch≈´ro at this time were Nakamura Kazu-uji of Suruga, Ikoma Chikamasa of Takamatsu, and Horio Yoshiharu of Tottori. = Oath of Allegiance = On the \\"fifth day of the eighth month\\", 1598, the Commissioners and the Regents signed the following articles: Article 1. That they should serve Hideyori with the same single-minded loyalty they had shown to Hideyoshi Article 2. The rules of Hideyoshi's house shall not be altered. When in the administration of public affairs the Five Commissioners were unable to determine on a course of action they were to consult their master (Hideyori) through Ieyasu and Toshiie, or necessary if taking action, the Emperor has to be consulted. Article 3. There were to be no factions among them. Personal considerations and partiality of every kind were to be excluded from their counsel. Article 4. The Five Commissioners, or overseers, must strive to work together in the administration of public affairs, suppressing all petty jealousies and differences. Article 5. In settling matters the opinion of the majority was usually to be followed. But at the same time if the opinion of the minority showed no signs of being dictated by any personal interests, it should be duly considered. If it should happen that only a few of the overseers were present when some question was settled, the absentees had no right to object unless it was quite evident that the private interests of the Commissioners present at the meeting prejudiced their minds in a wrong direction. In that case another meeting might be called. Article 6. It goes without saying that all accounts had to be kept in a manner that was above suspicion. There were to be no irregularities and no pressing of personal interests in this line. Article 7. Whatever Hideyoshi desired to be kept secret, whether it were connected with his private life or with the Government, must on no account be allowed to leak out Article 8. If any of the Commissioners or their followers found that unconsciously they had acted contrary to the orders given to them, they were at once to report the same to their superior officers, who would then deal leniently with them. Hideyoshi used a talisman (Japanese: Ë≠∑Á¨¶ Gofu) called Kumano-goufu (Japanese: ÁÜäÈáéÁâõÁéãÂ∫ú) from Kumano Shrine when making an oath with daimy≈ç, and it is said that when Hideyoshi's death was near, he made the five elders to write vows to remain faithful to him after his death. This vow is known in Japanese as Kishomon (Japanese: Ëµ∑Ë≠âÊñá). = Origin of the name \\"Go-Tair≈ç\\" = After the death of Hideyoshi, the five commissioners, including Ishida Mitsunari referred to Ieyasu and the other elders as Go-bugyoshu (Japanese:Âæ°Â•âË°åË°Ü) and referred to the five commissioners as Toshiyoridomo (Japanese:Âπ¥ÂØÑÂÖ±) on Kishomon. He purposely used the term Go-bugyoshu to remind the elders that their job is to support Hideyori with their lives. On the other hand, Shimazu Yoshihisa referred to the five elders as Go-rojushu (Japanese: Âæ°ËÄÅ‰∏≠Ë°Ü) and Kato Kiyomasa called them the Nihon-Gotoshiyorishu (Japanese: Êó•Êú¨Âæ°Âπ¥ÂØÑË°Ü). They both called the five commissioners Go-bugyoshu (Japanese: Âæ°Â•âË°åË°Ü). People were calling them differently depending on their relationship with the five elders and the five commissioners, but there is no document that gives evidence that the Five Elders were actually called as Go-Tairo. The word Tairo (Japanese: Â§ßËÄÅ) was the name of the highest position that was temporarily a higher position than Roju (Japanese: ËÄÅ‰∏≠), under the Tokugawa Shogunate. It is believed that the Five Elders were referred to as the Go-Tairo after the title of Tairo was created in the Edo Period.  The Five Elders  (In Japanese names, the family name is written first) = Tokugawa Ieyasu = Tokugawa Ieyasu (Japanese: Âæ≥Â∑ù ÂÆ∂Â∫∑) was the founder and first sh≈çgun of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan, which effectively ruled Japan from the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Among the Five Elders, Ieyasu held the most power measured in koku. He was also entrusted by Hideyoshi with the order of Soufujirei (Japanese: ÊÉ£ÁÑ°‰∫ã‰ª§) to take control of Kanto and Okuryogoku (Mutsu Province and Dewa Province) in 1587. After the Hidetsugu Incident (Japanese:ÁßÄÊ¨°‰∫ã‰ª∂ Hidetsugu Jiken) in 1597, Ieyasu was appointed to act as Regent temporarily until Hideyori reached 15 years of age and requested him to reside in Fushimi. Before the establishment of the Council, Hideyoshi awarded the province of the Hojo to Ieyasu after the successful Odawara campaigns in the Kanto region. This action demonstrated the power that Hideyoshi had over Ieyasu. = Ukita Hideie = Ukita Hideie (Japanese: ÂÆáÂñúÂ§ö ÁßÄÂÆ∂) was the daimy≈ç of Bizen and Mimasaka Provinces (modern Okayama Prefecture). He was a military commander and feudal lord during Azuchi-Momoyama period. Also referred to as Hachir≈ç (ÂÖ´ÈÉé). He was banished to Hachij≈ç Island after the Battle of Sekigahara. At the age of 26, Ukita was elected to be one of the five elders when he returned from Imjin war, also known as the Japanese invasions of Korea. (Japanese: ÊÖ∂Âºî„ÅÆÂΩπ keicho no eki). While he was an elder, he was also serving as a daimy≈ç during the Warring States period (Japanese: Êà¶ÂõΩÊôÇ‰ª£ Sengoku Jidai). = Maeda Toshiie = Maeda Toshiie (Japanese: ÂâçÁî∞ Âà©ÂÆ∂) was one of the leading generals of Oda Nobunaga following the Sengoku period of the 16th century extending to the Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period. Referred to as Chikuzen in the letters by Hideyoshi. He became one of the Five Elders at the age of 53. Hideyoshi entrusted the province of Kaga and Etch≈´ to Toshiie after taking the province from the daimy≈ç Sassa Narimasa. While he was an elder, he also had a position as senior second rank (Japanese: Ê®©Â§ßÁ¥çË®Ä Gon-Dainagon) and had the authority to pass his opinions on to the national government. After the death of Maeda Toshiie, his son, Maeda Toshinaga was to succeed him as a member of the Five Elders. = Uesugi Kagekatsu = Uesugi Kagekatsu (Japanese: ‰∏äÊùâ ÊôØÂãù) was a Japanese samurai and daimy≈ç during the Sengoku and Edo periods. He was the primary lord of the feudal domain of Yonesawa. He was elected to be a part of five elders at the age of 43. Since the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583, he had cooperated with Hideyoshi by aiding him during battles, and he was one of the earliest daimy≈ç to render homage to Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi had made alliances with Uesugi because he had the potential power to attack Ieyasu from the Echigo province in the north. = M≈çri Terumoto = M≈çri Terumoto (Japanese: ÊØõÂà© ËºùÂÖÉ) was a Japanese daimy≈ç during the Azuchi-Momoyama period and the Edo period. He was a descendant of the feudal lord of the Choshu domain. He became one of the Five Elders at the age of 46. Terumoto fought against Hideyoshi before the latter's rise to power, but lacked enough supporters. Realizing that Hideyoshi would be the next leader of the country, he began to build trust by sending gifts to celebrate Hideyoshi's victory at the Battle of Shizugatake and helping him in the Kyushu Campaign in 1587. He was allied with Ishida Mitsunari at the Battle of Sekigahara and acted as the head general of the Western Army. = Kobayakawa Takakage = Kobayakawa Takakage (Japanese: Â∞èÊó©Â∑ù ÈöÜÊôØ) was a samurai and daimy≈ç (feudal lord) during the Sengoku period and Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period. At first he fought against Hideyoshi as he was the one holding the power in the M≈çri family, but after the Battle of Shizugatake, he decided to submit to Hideyoshi. Under Hideyoshi's rule, he was assigned to be in charge of Chikuzen province, which is modern day Fukuoka. Takakage handed over rule of the family to Hidetoshi (Hideaki) and retired, moved to Mihara. Takakage refurbished Najima Castle (Japanese: ÂêçÂ≥∂Âüé Najima J≈ç) and made it his own residence. Kobayakawa died on June 12, 1597 at the age of 65. Due to the death of Kobayakawa in 1597, he is often excluded from the list of the Five Elders or referred as the 6th Elder. After his death his nephew, M≈çri Terumoto, took his place on the council of Five Elders.

Maeda Toshiie was given the order to raise Hideyori in Osaka Castle until he came of age to take his place as Hideyoshi's successor. Tokugawa Ieyasu was also charged with the role of guardian of Hideyori, as well as to see to Hideyori being appointed to the role of Regent. Ukita Hideie was to be counted on as a loyal member of Hideyori's service. = Attending to political business = Ieyasu was appointed by Hideyoshi to act as Regent (Japanese:ÊëÇÊîø Sessh≈ç) until Hideyori reached maturity and could take his place as leader. Uesugi Kagekatsu and M≈çri Terumoto were to informed and consulted on all political matters as advisers. The Elders were to deal with the administering of punishment to any person who broke the law. All monetary transactions were to be supervised by the Elders, and the elders were tasked with to setting up an account for Hideyori when he came of age. = Withdrawal from Korea = After Hideyoshi's death the Council of Five Elders issued an order for the Japanese army at the Korean Peninsula to return. The Council feared disorder among Hideyoshi‚Äôs troops in Korea if they were to be told of his death and so, his death was not told to the armies in order to preserve their morale. After the withdrawal of Japanese armies which followed a military stalemate, the final peace negotiations to mark the end of war continued for several years.Turnbull, Stephen. Samurai Invasions of Korea 1592‚Äì1598, p. 85 = Other roles = Ieyasu and Toshiie were to clear up any difficulties in administration encountered by the Five Commissioners, further acting as advisers or mediators in administration matters. The sons of both Tokugawa Ieyasu and Maeda Toshiie (Tokugawa Iesada and Maeda Toshinaga respectively) were to assist their fathers with work related to the Five Elders, with plan of the latter being appointed as an Elder in the future. Changes to Oath of Allegiance document Tokugawa Ieyasu made some changes to Article 2 of the Oath of Allegiance document that no rules shall be amended, and that decisions were to be made by the majority in all cases. On the Article 6 of the Allegiance Document Ieyasu added the following statements: \\"No questions concerning landed estate will be dealt with during the minority of Hideyori. No petitions made to him will be sent in; neither will Ieyasu himself ask for any changes to be made in the matter of land-ownership nor will he accept any gifts of land from Hideyori during his minority.\\" Maeda Toshiie added the following words \\"When Hideyori shall have reached his majority, certain representations shall be made to him by the Five Commissioners and by Ieyasu in reference to the bestowal of land on those whose services deserve reward and in reference to the confiscation of land in the case of those who have acted unworthily.\\" = Power balance between the council = The power balance between the council depended on the position each members held and the amount of koku they held. Ieyasu was entitled with the position of inner minister (Japanese: ÂÜÖÂ§ßËá£ Naidaijin) in the fifth month of 1596. Maeda was acting as counselor of the first rank (Japanese: Â§ßÁ¥çË®Ä Dainagon)and the other three were counselors of the second rank (Japanese: ‰∏≠Á¥çË®Ä Chunagon). Ieyasu was in the highest position among the members and his ownership of a great amount of koku allowed him to secure his position among other Elders. In general, 10,000 koku was believed to be equivalent to having 250 soldiers in one's control, so the amount of Koku (Japanese: Áü≥) didn't only represent the income each daimy≈ç has, but show how much military power they held. Hideyoshi himself owned approximately 2,000,000 koku, which is not including the lands held by his most trusted vassals. Ieyasu was also known as a powerful military commander, and Hideyoshi's fear of Ieyasu and riots in favor of Ieyasu also led him to appoint Ieyasu as a member of the Council of Five Elders. The amount of potential income, measured in koku, that each council member held (one koku = 4.96 bushels or 278.3 liters of rice): * Tokugawa Ieyasu: 2,400,000 koku * Maeda Toshiie: 830,000 koku * Ukita Hideie: 570,000 koku * Uesugi Kagekatsu: 1,200,000 koku * Mori Terumoto: 1,120,000 koku  Tokugawa hegemony  Ieyasu engaged his sons and daughters into political marriages which became a cause of disagreement between the Elders and Commissioners. Ieyasu married his son Tadateru to the Date Masamune's daughter Irohahime. The cause for disagreement in these matters were due to statements in ‚ÄùThe wall writings of Osaka Castle\\" (Japanese: Â§ßÈò™Âüé‰∏≠Â£ÅÊõ∏ Osakajochu-kabegaki) of 1595 that marriages would need the consultation of both Elders and Commissioners. The Commissioners called for Ieyasu's resignation on the grounds of these marriages. One of the retainers, Ishida Mitsunari, complained about this matter to Maeda Toshiie. Ieyasu insisted that it was not a big matter; and this issue was resolved by Horio Yoshiharu, who happened to be a friend of Ieyasu. = Rise of conflict = After the death of Hideyoshi, friction generated between the council members. Two factions formed, the Bunchiha (Japanese: ÊñáÊ≤ªÊ¥æ) (those who wished for a state governed by a specialized civil service) and the Bundanha (Japanese: Ê≠¶Êñ≠Ê¥æ) (those in favor of a strong military authority), of these two factions Tokugawa Ieyasu was part of the bundanha. One year after Maeda Toshiie died, Ieyasu saw his chance to take control. The death of Maeda Toshiie in 1599 made Ieyasu the most experienced of the Five Elders. Finally, due to the fact that Uesugi Kagekatsu had been illegally constructing and restoring forts, Ieyasu was able to justify going to battle which led to the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Following the battle, in 1603, Ieyasu became Sh≈çgun while Hideyori was declared naidaijin. Ieyasu sent his granddaughter, Senhime to Osaka to marry Hideyori in order to stabilize the relationship between the two families.Mon) Tokugawa Ieyasu rose to power while originally working in the name of Toyotomi Hideyori. Eventually, after Ieyasu's power seemed to be threatened by Hideyori a long series of plots both against Ieyasu and Hideyori occurred followed by the multiple battles of the Siege of Osaka (1614-1615). Tokugawa Ieyasu reigned victorious against the Toyotomi clan, eliminating them completely, thus cementing his place as ruler of Japan.Mon) Following the Tokugawa victory at the Siege of Osaka in 1615, Ieyasu was not satisfied with destruction of Hideyori alone, but in order to make sure the Toyotomi clan would not be able to return to power in the future, he had as many as possible of the Toyotomi family killed, or in the case of Hideyori's daughter, placed in a nunnery. Ieyasu had Hideyori‚Äôs son Kunimatsu, who was 8 years old at the time, killed at the Rokuj≈ç riverbed (Rokuj≈ç-Gawara) in Kyoto.  In popular culture  The Council of Five Elders can also be seen in Japanese historical drama, Taiga Drama, which is broadcast by NHK. This topic is briefly mentioned in Gunshi Kanbei and Tenchijin, and more in detail in Sanadamaru. In the 31st episode of Sanadamaru, a brief explanation of why the Council of Five Elders didn't work out as Hideyoshi expected is explained and we can also see that Elders were referred as Otonashu(Japanese: ËÄÅË°Ü). The drama also shows that early death of Maeda Toshiie had led to Ieyasu gaining more power, and Ishida Mitsunari's lack of popularity among the Toyotomi family caused a lot people to support Ieyasu during the Battle of Sekigahara.

Following discussions with the Association of Manitoba Municipalities, Smith announced that the money would be distributed to different parts of the province on a per capita basis. Representatives from major cities brought forward an alternate proposal, wherein 90% of the funds would be made available on a per capita basis and 10% put directly toward public transit in urban centres.Mia Rabson, \\"Gas-tax decision 'copout,' says city\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 February 2005, A3; Mia Rabson, \\"Feds reopening gas-tax deal\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 March 2005, B5; Mia Rabson, \\"Municipalities won't speed OK for gas-tax deal\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 November 2005, B2.

The title implies autocephaly and in some cases it is the title of the head of an autonomous church. The word comes from ancient Greek Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒøŒªŒπŒ∫œåœÇ, pl. Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒøŒªŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ, derived from Œ∫Œ±Œ∏' ·ΩÖŒªŒøœÖ (kath'olou, \\"generally\\") from Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨ (kata, \\"down\\") and ·ΩÖŒªŒøœÇ (holos, \\"whole\\"), meaning \\"concerning the whole, universal, general\\"; it originally designated a financial or civil office in the Roman Empire.Wigram, p. 91. The name of the Catholic Church comes from the same word - however, the title \\"Catholicos\\" does not exist in its hierarchy. The Church of the East, some Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox churches, and some Eastern Catholic Churches historically use this title;The Motu Proprio Cleri Sanctitati Canon 335 for example the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Georgian Orthodox Church. In the Church of the East, the title was given to the church's head, the Patriarch of the Church of the East. It is still used in two successor churches, the Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East, the heads of which are known as Catholicos-Patriarchs. In the Armenian Church there are two catholicoi: the supreme catholicos of Ejmiadzin and the catholicos of Cilicia. The title Catholicos-Patriarch is also used by the primate of the Armenian Catholic Church.https://www.britannica.com/topic/catholicos In India, head of Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, an autocephalous Oriental Orthodox Church; and regional head of Malankara Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church, an autonomous Church within Syriac Orthodox Church, use this title. The first is known as Catholicos of the East and the latter as Catholicos of India.  Origin of the title  The earliest ecclesiastical use of the title Catholicos was by the Bishop of Armenia, head of the Armenian Apostolic Church, in the 4th century while still under the Patriarchate of Antioch. Among the Armenians, catholicos was originally a simple title for the principal bishop of the country; he was subordinate to the See of Caesarea in Cappadocia. Sometime later, it was adopted by the bishops of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in Persia, who became the designated heads of the Church of the East. The first claim that the bishop of Selucia-Ctesiphon was superior to the other bishoprics and had (using a later term) patriarchal rights was made by Patriarch Papa bar Gaggai (or Aggai, c. 317-c. 329). In the 5th century this was claim strengthened and Isaac (or Ishaq, 399-c.410), who organized the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, used the title of bishop of Selucia-Ctesiphon, Catholicos and Head over the bishops of all the Orient. This line of Catholicos founded the Church of the East and the development of the East Syriac Rite. At the beginning of the fourth century, Albania and Georgia (Iberia) were converted to Christianity, and the principal bishop of each of these countries bore the title of catholicos, although neither of them was autocephalous. They followed the Armenians in rejecting the Council of Chalcedon. At the end of the sixth, or beginning of the seventh, century the Georgian Catholicos asserted his independence and accepted Eastern Orthodoxy. Henceforward the Georgian Church underwent the same evolutions as the Greek. In 1783 Georgia was forced to abolish the office of its catholicos, and place itself under the Holy Synod of Russia, to which country it was united politically in 1801. The Albanian catholicos remained loyal to the Armenian Church, with the exception of a brief schism towards the end of the sixth century. Shortly afterwards Albania was assimilated partly with Armenia and partly with Georgia. There is no mention of any catholicos in Albania after the seventh century. It is asserted by some that the head of the Abyssinian Church, the Abuna, also bears the title of catholicos, but, although this name may have been applied to him by analogy, there is, to our knowledge, no authority for asserting that this title is used by the Abyssinian Church itself. Catholicos in various Churches =Autocephalous churches of East = The following are autocephalous churches of East Syriac Rite that claim succession to the Catholicos of the East of Selucia-Ctesiphon from the Church of the East. Referred to as Nestorian in Western texts, the term Nestorian was formally renounced in 1976 by Dinkha IV. Assyrian Church of the East , Gewargis III is the Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East. One of the oldest Christian churches, it is a modern successor of the historical Church of the East. It traces its origins to the See of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in central Mesopotamia, which tradition holds was founded by Saint Thomas the Apostle (Tooma Shlikha) as well as Saint Mari and Saint Addai in AD 33 as asserted in the Doctrine of Addai. It is one of the three Churches of the East that hold themselves distinct from Oriental and Eastern Orthodoxy. The Assyrian Church of the East does not use the word \\"orthodox\\" in any of its service books or official correspondence, nor does it use any word which can be translated as \\"correct faith\\" or \\"correct doctrine,\\" the rough translation of \\"orthodox\\". The adjectives \\"holy,\\" \\"catholic,\\" and \\"apostolic\\" were officially added to the Assyrian Church of the East's title in conformance with the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed which declares, \\"We believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church.\\" In this context, \\"holy\\" refers to being set apart for a purely sacred purpose; \\"apostolic\\" means founded by one of Jesus's own apostles; and \\"catholic\\" is the Greek word for \\"universal,\\" indicating a worldwide church. In India, it is more often called the Chaldean Syrian Church. In the West it is often called the Nestorian Church, due to its historical associations with Nestorianism, though the church itself considers the term pejorative and argues that this association is incorrect. The church declares that no other church has suffered as many martyrdoms as the Assyrian Church of the East. The founders of Assyrian theology were Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia, who taught at Antioch. The normative Christology of the Assyrian church was written by Babai the Great (551‚Äì628) and is clearly distinct from the accusations directed toward Nestorius: his main christological work is called the 'Book of the Union', and in it Babai teaches that the two (essences, or hypostases) are unmingled but everlastingly united in the one (personality) of Christ. Ancient Church of the East , Addai II is the Catholicos of the Ancient Church of the East, which split from the Assyrian Church of the East in the 1960s. =Eastern Orthodox Church= Georgian Orthodox Church The title of catholicos is also used in the Georgian Church, whose head carries the title Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia. * Catholicos of Georgian Orthodox Church  Ilia II is the current (as of 22 February 2012) Catholicos of the Georgian Orthodox Church. = Oriental Orthodox Churches =  Armenian Apostolic Church  In the Armenian Church there are two catholicoi: the supreme catholicos of Ejmiadzin and the catholicos of Cilicia. The Catholicos of Etchmiadzin presides over the Supreme Spiritual Council of the Armenian Apostolic Church and is the head of the world's 7 million Armenian Orthodox Christians. The primacy of honour of the Catholicossate of Etchmiadzin has always been recognized by the Catholicossate of Cilicia. * Catholicos of Etchmiadzin (Chief Shepherd and Pontiff to all Armenians dispersed throughout the worldOfficial Website of the Armenian Church ) of the Armenian Apostolic Church,  Karekin II is the current Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church. * Catholicossate of the Great House of Cilicia.

The park features water activities, camping facilities, and recreational trails and is located about south of Interstate 68 on U.S. Route 219. History Although settlers arrived in the area in the 1700s, it was the massive logging operations of the 20th century that stripped the land of its virgin forest. The park's forest of oaks and hickories was regenerated from the original timber stand. The Deep Creek Lake reservoir was created on a tributary of the Youghiogheny River with completion of the Deep Creek Dam by the Pennsylvania Electric Company in 1925. The state took charge of recreation on the lake in 1980, then purchased the land underlying the lake and buffer zone properties for $17 million in 2000. In September 2010, the Appalachian Regional Commission $20,000 in funding for a study of potential development at Deep Creek Lake. An official tourism website promoting Deep Creek Lake was launched soon after by the Garrett County Chamber of Commerce. Activities and amenities Lake activities include motor boating, water skiing, swimming, fishing, and canoeing. A campground has 112 campsites, 26 with electricity. Trails are used for hiking and mountain biking. The park's Discovery Center offers exhibits on local plants and wildlife, including the American black bears occasionally seen in the campground, the lake and its watershed, conservation issues, and local coal and logging activities in addition to the daily educational programs about nature and the environment presented by naturalists, rangers, and volunteers. =Johnny's Bait House= Johnny's Bait House was a business and facility that operated on the shore of Deep Creek Lake from 1955 to 2003. It was owned and operated by Johnny Marple and his wife Elaine. Johnny promoted and supported the fishing industry at Deep Creek Lake. In the early years, Johnny's was open year-round, supporting all fishing, including ice fishing, but eventually started closing during the winter months. Johnny's provided the Deep Creek Lake Fishing Report to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and many publications such as The Washington Post, Baltimore Sun, Field and Stream Magazine. and Star Democrat. Johnnys partnered with the Garrett County Promotion Council and founded the Garrett County Fishing Contest, a weekly event that continues to this day. The establishment also managed the official Deep Creek Lake Fishing records through 2003. During that time, multiple Maryland state freshwater fishing record catches were registered. Johnny assisted the State of Maryland Department of Natural Resources in the monitoring of fish population and the registration of fish tagged for population studies. Many of the collection of mounted fish from that time period are still on display in the Discovery Center of the Deep Creek Lake State Park. The former location of Johnny's is currently occupied by Bill's Outdoor Center.

California Birth Index, 1905‚Äì1995. Center for Health Statistics, California Department of Health Services, Sacramento, California. (July 1, 1925 ‚Äì March 27, 2011) was an American actor, best known for his two collaborations with director Alfred Hitchcock: Rope in 1948 and Strangers on a Train in 1951. Granger was first noticed in a small stage production in Hollywood by a Goldwyn casting director, and given a significant role in The North Star, a controversial film praising the Soviet Union at the height of World War II, but later condemned for its political bias. Another war film, The Purple Heart, followed, before Granger's naval service in Honolulu, in a unit that arranged troop entertainment in the Pacific. Here he made useful contacts, including Bob Hope, Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth. It was also where he began exploring his bisexuality, which he said he never felt any need to conceal. In 1948, Hitchcock cast him in Rope, a fictionalized account of the Leopold and Loeb murder case, which earned mixed reviews, but much critical praise for Granger. Hitchcock then cast him again in Strangers on a Train, as a tennis star drawn into a double murder plot by a wealthy psychopath, played by Robert Walker. Granger would describe this as his happiest film-making experience, and was deeply saddened by Walker's death shortly after shooting. Granger continued to appear on stage, film and television well into his 70s. His work ranged from classical drama on Broadway to several Italian-language films and major documentaries about Hollywood. He tended to find fault with his directors and scriptwriters, however, and his career remains defined by the two Hitchcock films. Early life Granger was born in San Jose, California, the son of Eva (n√©e Hopkins) and Farley Earle Granger, Sr. He lived at 1185 Hanchett Avenue in the Hanchett Residence Park neighborhood.Clark, Shannon E. \\"Page 105.\\" The Alameda: The Beautiful Way. San Jose, CA: Alameda Business Association, 2006. N. pag. Print. His wealthy father owned a Willys-Overland automobile dealership, and the family frequently spent time at their beach house in Capitola. Following the stock market crash in 1929, the Grangers were forced to sell both their homes and most of their personal belongings and move into an apartment above the family business, where they remained for the next two years. As a result of this financial setback and the loss of their social status, both of Granger's parents began to drink heavily. Eventually the remainder of their possessions were sold at auction to settle their debts, and the elder Granger used the last car on his lot to spirit away the family to Los Angeles in the middle of the night.Granger, Farley, Include Me Out. New York: St. Martin's Press 2007. , p. 14 The family settled in a small apartment in a seedy part of Hollywood, and Granger's parents worked at various temporary jobs. Their drinking increased, and the couple frequently fought. Hoping he might become a tap dancer, Granger's mother enrolled him at Ethel Meglin's, the dance and drama instruction studio where Judy Garland and Shirley Temple had started.Include Me Out, p. 15 Granger's father found work as a clerk in the North Hollywood branch of the California Department of Unemployment, and his salary allowed him to put a small down payment on a house in Studio City, where their neighbor was actor/dancer Donald O'Connor.Include Me Out, p. 16 At his office, Granger's father became acquainted with unemployment benefits recipient Harry Langdon, who advised him to take his son to a small local theatre where open auditions for The Wookie, a British play about Londoners struggling to survive during World War II, were being held. Granger's use of a Cockney accent impressed the director, and he was cast in multiple roles. The opening night audience included talent agent Phil Gersh and Samuel Goldwyn casting director Bob McIntyre, and the following morning Gersh contacted Granger's parents and asked them to bring him to his office that afternoon to discuss the role of Damian, a teenaged Russian boy in the film The North Star.Include Me Out, pp. 8‚Äì9 Granger auditioned for producer Goldwyn, screenwriter Lillian Hellman and director Lewis Milestone. Hellman was trying to convince Montgomery Clift to leave the Broadway play in which he was appearing, and when her efforts proved to be futile, the role was given to Granger. Goldwyn signed him to a seven-year contract for $100 per week.Include Me Out, pp. 19‚Äì13 Early career The studio publicity department was concerned audiences would confuse Granger with British actor Stewart Granger, so they suggested he change his name and offered him a list from which to choose. \\"The names were all interchangeable, like Gordon Gregory and Gregory Gordon. I didn't want to change my name,\\" Granger later recalled. \\"I liked Farley Granger. It was my father's name, and his grandfather's name. They kept bringing me new combinations, and finally I offered to change it to Kent Clark. I was the only one who thought it was funny.\\" Eventually the studio issued a press release announcing Farley Granger, a senior at North Hollywood High School, had been cast in The North Star after he responded to an ad in the local paper. \\"I thought that was a really dumb story,\\" said Granger. \\"The truth was much more interesting.\\"Include Me Out, p. 17 Making the film proved to be a fortunate start to Granger's career. He enjoyed working with director Milestone and fellow cast members Dana Andrews, Anne Baxter, Walter Brennan and Jane Withers, and during filming he met composer Aaron Copland, who remained a friend in later years. When released, the film was savaged by critics working for newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst, a staunch anti-Communist who felt the movie was Soviet propaganda.Include Me Out, pp. 20‚Äì24 For Granger's next film, he was loaned out to 20th Century Fox, where Darryl F. Zanuck cast him in The Purple Heart, in which he was directed by Milestone and again co-starred with Dana Andrews. Granger became a close friend of supporting cast member Sam Levene, a character actor from New York City who took him under his wing. He also became a friend of Roddy McDowall and found himself linked with June Haver in gossip columns and fan magazines.Include Me Out, pp. 25‚Äì28 Upon completion of The Purple Heart, Granger enlisted in the United States Navy. Following U.S. Navy Recruit Training in Farragut, Idaho, he sailed from Treasure Island in San Francisco to Honolulu. During the 17-day crossing, he suffered from chronic seasickness and lost 23 pounds, and upon arrival in Hawaii he was admitted to the hospital for several days of rehydration. As a result, the remainder of his military career was spent onshore, where he first was assigned to the cleanup crew at an enlisted men's club situated at the end of Waikiki Beach and then to a unit in Honolulu that worked with Army Special Services that was commanded by classical actor Maurice Evans, who put together and arranged entertainment for all the troops in the Pacific. It was here that he had the opportunity to meet and mingle with visiting entertainers such as Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Betty Grable, Rita Hayworth, Hedy Lamarr, Gertrude Lawrence, and many others.Include Me Out, pp. 29‚Äì37 It was during his naval stint in Honolulu that Granger had his first sexual experiences, one with a hostess at a private club and the other with a Navy officer visiting the same venue, both on the same night. He was startled to discover he was attracted to both men and women equally, and in his memoir he observed, > I finally came to the conclusion that for me, everything I had done that > night was as natural and as good as it felt ... I never have felt the need > to belong to any exclusive, self-defining, or special group ... I was never > ashamed, and I never felt the need to explain or apologize for my > relationships to anyone .... I have loved men. I have loved women.Include Me > Out, pp. 37‚Äì41 Granger returned to civilian life and was pleased to discover his parents had curbed their drinking and were treating each other more civilly. Goldwyn increased his weekly salary to $200 and presented him with a 1940 Ford Coupe. The actor was introduced to Saul Chaplin and his wife Ethel, who became his lifelong mentor, confidante and best friend.Include Me Out, pp. 48‚Äì53 Through the couple, Granger met Betty Comden, Adolph Green, Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein and Gene Kelly, who invited him to join his open house gatherings that included Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Frank Sinatra, Betty Garrett, Johnny Mercer, Harold Arlen and Stanley Donen. Most influential among his new acquaintances was director Nicholas Ray, who cast Granger in his film noir Thieves Like Us. The film was nearing completion in October 1947 when Howard Hughes acquired RKO Radio Pictures, and the new studio head shelved it for two years before releasing it under the title They Live by Night in a single theater in London. Enthusiastic reviews led RKO to finally release the film in the States in late 1949. During the two years it had remained in limbo, it had been screened numerous times in private screening rooms, and one of the people who saw it during this period was Alfred Hitchcock, who was preparing Rope.Include Me Out, pp. 57‚Äì60 Granger was in New York when he was summoned to return to Hollywood and discuss Rope with Hitchcock. The night before their initial meeting, Granger coincidentally met Arthur Laurents, who had written the film's screenplay, which was based on the play Rope's End, a fictionalized account of the Leopold and Loeb murder case. It was not until he began reading the script that he connected its author with the man he had met the previous night. Granger and Laurents met again, and Laurents invited the actor to spend the night. He declined, but when the offer was extended again several days later, he accepted. It proved to be the start of a romantic relationship that lasted about a year and a frequently tempestuous friendship that extended for decades beyond their breakup.Include Me Out, pp. 66‚Äì71 In Rope, Granger and John Dall portrayed two intellectuals who commit a murder simply to prove they can get away with it. The two characters and their former professor, played by Jimmy Stewart, were supposed to be homosexual, and Granger and Dall discussed the subtext of their scenes. Because The Hays Office was keeping close tabs on the project, however, the final script was so discreet that Laurents remained uncertain of whether Stewart ever realized that his own character was homosexual.Laurents, Arthur, Original Story By. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 2000. , pp. 115‚Äì116, 124‚Äì131 Hitchcock shot the film in continuous, uninterrupted 10-minute takes, the amount of time a reel of Technicolor film lasted, and, as a result, technical problems frequently brought the action to a frustrating halt throughout the 21-day shoot. The film ultimately received mixed reviews, although most critics were impressed by Granger, who in later years said he was happy to be part of the experience, but wondered \\"what the film would have been like had [Hitchcock] shot it normally\\" and \\"had he not had to worry about censorship.\\"Include Me Out, p. 71 Upon the completion of Rope, Goldwyn cast Granger, Teresa Wright, David Niven and Evelyn Keyes in Enchantment, which was panned for a weak script and indifferent direction by Irving Reis. It failed at the box office, as did his next project, Roseanna McCoy, during which he and Laurents parted ways.Include Me Out, pp. 79‚Äì83 While filming Side Street on location in Manhattan for Anthony Mann, Granger briefly became involved with Leonard Bernstein, who invited him to join him on his South American tour. By the time Granger completed the film, the composer/conductor had married Costa Rican pianist and actress Felicia Montealegre. The two men remained friends until Bernstein's death.Include Me Out, pp. 84‚Äì87 Leading roles Granger's next two films for Goldwyn, Edge of Doom and Our Very Own, were unpleasant working experiences, and the actor refused to allow the producer to loan him to Universal Pictures for an inferior magic carpet saga. When he was placed on suspension, he decided to accompany Ethel Chaplin, who had separated from her husband, and her daughter on a trip to Paris. At the last moment they were joined by Arthur Laurents, who remained behind when the group departed for London to see the opening of the New York City Ballet, which had been choreographed by Jerome Robbins. He and Granger engaged in a casual affair until the actor was summoned to return to New York to help publicize Our Very Own and Edge of Doom, both of which received dreadful reviews. Goldwyn cancelled the nationwide openings of the latter, hoping to salvage it by adding wraparound scenes that would change the focus of the film, and Granger refused to promote it any further. Once again placed on suspension, he departed for Europe, where he spent time in Italy, Austria and Germany with Laurents before being contacted about an upcoming film by Alfred Hitchcock.Include Me Out, pp. 91‚Äì107 In the trailer for Strangers on a Train, (1951). The project was Strangers on a Train, in which Granger was cast as tennis player and aspiring politician Guy Haines. He is introduced to psychopathic Bruno Anthony, portrayed by Robert Walker, who suggests they swap murders, with Bruno killing Guy's wife and Guy disposing of Bruno's father. As with Rope, there was a homosexual subtext to the two men's relationship, although it was toned down from Patricia Highsmith's original novel. Granger and Walker, whose wife Jennifer Jones had recently left him for David O. Selznick, became close friends and confidantes during filming, and Granger was devastated when Walker died from an accidental combination of alcohol and barbiturates prior to the film's release. It proved to be a box office hit, the first major success of Granger's career, and his \\"happiest filmmaking experience\\".Include Me Out, pp. 107‚Äì09 On December 31, 1950, Granger picked up close friend Shelley Winters to escort her to Sam Spiegel's traditional New Year's Eve gala. The actress kept him waiting for nearly two hours, and they argued while en route to the party. Once there, they went their separate ways, and Granger met Ava Gardner. The two left to hear Nat King Cole perform at a nearby nightclub and then went to Granger's home, where they began an intense affair that lasted until Gardner began filming Show Boat a month later.Include Me Out, pp. 112‚Äì13 Having reconciled, Granger and Winters went to New York City, where they audited classes at the Actors Studio and the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. Winters subscribed to the concept of method acting, but Granger felt an actor \\"had to be faithful to the text, not adapt it to some personal sense memory,\\" and their disagreement triggered more arguments.Include Me Out, pp. 114‚Äì16 Their plan to pursue individual training programs was disrupted when both were called back to Hollywood. Goldwyn cast Granger in I Want You, a drama about the effect the Korean War has on an American family still trying to recover from World War II. Granger thought the screenplay by Irwin Shaw was \\"not only dull, but felt dated,\\" but welcomed the opportunity to work with Dana Andrews and Dorothy McGuire. Goldwyn expected the film to be as successful as The Best Years of Our Lives, but it proved to be as \\"tepid and old-fashioned\\" as Granger feared and, opening after cease-fire negotiations with Korea had begun, no longer topical, and it died at the box office.Include Me Out, pp. 116‚Äì17 His subsequent projects ‚Äì a screwball comedy with Winters called Behave Yourself!, the Gift of the Magi segment of the anthology film O. Henry's Full House, and the musical film Hans Christian Andersen ‚Äì were no more successful.Include Me Out, pp. 118‚Äì36 During the filming of the latter, he appeared on set in a Camel commercial. Eager to work with Vincente Minnelli, Granger accepted a role opposite Leslie Caron and Ethel Barrymore in Mademoiselle, one of three segments in the 1953 MGM film The Story of Three Loves. The film's producer, Gottfried Reinhardt, also directed the other two segments, and he mercilessly edited Mademoiselle in order to give his stories more screen time.Include Me Out, pp. 138‚Äì39 Unhappy with the direction his career was taking, Granger sought solace with Shelley Winters, who was separated from Vittorio Gassman, and the two friends resumed their love affair, which at one point nearly had culminated in marriage. Their relationship was complicated, but Granger felt \\"it works for us.\\"Include Me Out, p. 140 Scene with Alida Valli in the film Senso, 1954 Granger's next project was Small Town Girl, a musical with Jane Powell, Ann Miller and Bobby Van. Upon its completion, he bought his release from Goldwyn, a costly decision that left him with serious financial difficulties. Granger was determined to move to Manhattan to study acting and perform on stage, but his agent convinced him to accept a role in Senso, directed by Luchino Visconti and co-starring Alida Valli. Filming in Italy lasted nine months, although Granger frequently was idle during this period, allowing him free time to explore Italy and even spend a long weekend in Paris, where he had a brief affair with Jean Marais. During his time in Venice, Granger renewed his friendship with Peggy Guggenheim, whom he had met during his earlier trip to Italy with Arthur Laurents, and he met Mike Todd, who cajoled him into making a cameo appearance as a gondolier in his epic Around the World in 80 Days. He finally returned to Hollywood exhausted but happy about the experience.Include Me Out, pp. 142‚Äì76 Upon his return to the States, Darryl F. Zanuck offered Granger a two-picture deal, and in quick succession he made The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing, in which he portrayed tycoon Harry Kendall Thaw, and The Naked Street, a melodrama the actor thought was \\"preachy, trite and pedestrian,\\" although he welcomed the opportunity to work with Anthony Quinn and Anne Bancroft.Include Me Out, pp. 177‚Äì78 In 1955, Granger moved to New York and began studying with Bob Fosse, Gloria Vanderbilt, James Kirkwood and Tom Tryon in a class taught by Sandy Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. During this period he made his Broadway debut in The Carefree Tree, a play with music based on an old Chinese legend. The cast included Janice Rule as Granger's love interest and Alvin Ailey, Frances Sternhagen, Jerry Stiller and Sada Thompson in supporting roles. The play closed after only 24 performances, but shortly after its demise Rule moved in with Granger, and before long they were making wedding plans. They gradually realized the love their characters had felt on stage actually had not carried over into real life, and the two went their separate ways, although they remained friends until her death in 2003.Include Me Out, pp. 106‚Äì08 With both his film and theatrical career foundering, Granger turned to television. He starred in Beyond This Place, an adaptation of the A.J. Cronin novel of the same title, with Shelley Winters and Peggy Ann Garner, and joined Julie Harris for a remake of The Heiress. He also was featured in episodes of Climax Mystery Theater, Ford Television Theatre, The 20th Century Fox Hour, Robert Montgomery Presents, Playhouse 90, Wagon Train, Kraft Television Theatre, The United States Steel Hour, and The Bell Telephone Hour, and in later years Get Smart, Run for Your Life, Ironside, The Name of the Game and Hawaii Five-O, among others. In 1959, Granger returned to Broadway as Fitzwilliam Darcy opposite Polly Bergen as Elizabeth Bennet in First Impressions, a musical adaptation of Pride and Prejudice with a book and direction by Abe Burrows. The tryout in New Haven was a disaster, and reviews were mixed. Things improved slightly during the Philadelphia run, but by the time the production reached New York, Bergen ‚Äì who was fighting bitterly with co-star Hermione Gingold ‚Äì was experiencing serious vocal problems, and some of her songs would be cut during each performance, creating confusion for the rest of the cast. Only two of seven critics wrote favorable reviews, Bergen was replaced by understudy Ellen Hanley, and the musical closed in less than three months.Include Me Out, pp. 193‚Äì200 Later that year, he was cast in The Warm Peninsula, a play by Joe Masteroff. Co-starring Julie Harris, June Havoc and Larry Hagman, it received fair reviews and closed after only 86 performances.Include Me Out, pp. 200‚Äì02 Later career Despite his three unsuccessful Broadway experiences, Granger continued to focus on theater in the early 1960s. He accepted an invitation from Eva Le Gallienne to join her National Repertory Theatre. During their first season, while the company was in Philadelphia, John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The President had attended NRT's opening night and post-performance gala in the nation's capital, so the news hit everyone in the company especially hard. Granger had become a close friend of production supervisor Robert Calhoun, and although both had felt a mutual attraction, they never had discussed it. That night they became lovers.Include Me Out, pp. 209‚Äì17 Granger finally achieved some success on Broadway in The Seagull, The Crucible, The Glass Menagerie, and Deathtrap. He starred opposite Barbara Cook in a revival of The King and I at the off- Broadway New York City Center,Include Me Out, pp. 204‚Äì06 and in 1979 he was cast in the Roundabout Theatre Company production of A Month in the Country. In 1986 he won the Obie Award for his performance in the Lanford Wilson play Talley & Son. In the early 1970s, Granger and Calhoun moved to Rome, where the actor made a series of Italian language films, most notably They Call Me Trinity. He also appeared on several soap operas, including One Life to Live, on which his portrayal of Will Vernon garnered him a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, The Edge of Night, and As the World Turns, produced by Calhoun. Granger acted alongside Mario Adorf in the Italian thriller film What Have They Done to Your Daughters? (La Polizia chiede aiuto), which was directed by Massimo Dallamano. In 1974, he appeared in an episode of the ABC police drama Nakia. Later he appeared in several documentaries discussing Hollywood in general and Alfred Hitchcock in particular. In 1995, he was interviewed on camera for The Celluloid Closet, discussing the depiction of homosexuality in film and the use of subtext in various films, including his own. In 2003, Granger made his last film appearance in Broadway: The Golden Age, by the Legends Who Were There. In it, he tells the story of leaving Hollywood at the peak of his fame, buying out his contract from Samuel Goldwyn, and moving to Manhattan to work on the Broadway stage. In 2007, Granger published the memoir Include Me Out, co-written with domestic partner Robert Calhoun (born 24 November 1930). In the book, named after one of Goldwyn's famous malapropisms, he freely discusses his career and personal life. Calhoun died of lung cancer in New York, New York on May 24, 2008, at age 77. Death Granger died of natural causes in his Manhattan apartment on March 27, 2011, at age 85. His body was cremated and his ashes given to family after a service at The Riverside restaurant.Wilson, Scott.

History Curtiss JN-4 Jennies of the 111th Observation Squadron, 1925 The Texas Air National Guard origins date to 14 August 1917 with the establishment of the 111th Aero Squadron as part of the World War I United States Army Air Service. The 111th served at Kelly Field, San Antonio, then after the 1918 Armistice with Germany was demobilized in 1919. The Militia Act of 1903 established the present National Guard system, units raised by the states but paid for by the Federal Government, liable for immediate state service. If federalized by presidential order, they fall under the regular military chain of command. On 1 June 1920, the Militia Bureau issued Circular No.1 on organization of National Guard air units.ANG Chronology 1908-2007, see also Brief History of the Minnesota Air National Guard and the 133rd Airlift Wing, 1. The unit was reorganized with the establishment of a permanent air service in 1920, forming in the old Houston Light Guard Armory. The 111th Observation Squadron received Federal Recognition on 29 June 1923, as part of the 36th Division, Texas Air National Guard. It is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. The 111th Observation Squadron was ordered into active service on 25 November 1940 as part of the buildup of the Army Air Corps prior to the United States entry into World War II. On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re-establish them as Air National Guard units.Rosenfeld, Susan and Gross, Charles J (2007), Air National Guard at 60: A History. Air National Guard history program AFD-080527-040 A North American F-51D Mustang of the 111th Fighter Squadron at Ellington Field, Houston, 1948 The modern Texas ANG received federal recognition on 27 January 1947 as the 136th Fighter Group at Love Field Airport, Dallas. It's 181st Fighter Squadron was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and its mission was the air defense of the state. Other units assigned to the 136th in 1947 were the 111th Fighter Squadron at Ellington Field, Houston, and the 182d Fighter Squadron at Kelly Field, San Antonio. They were also equipped with F-51D Mustangs. 18 September 1947, however, is considered the Texas Air National Guard's official birth concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act. On 1 July 1957 the 111th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in Houston was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 147th Fighter Group (Air Defense) was allotted by the National Guard Bureau, extended federal recognition and activated. On 1 August 1961 the 182d FIS in San Antonio was expanded to become the 149th Fighter-Interceptor Group. Lt. George W. Bush during his service in the Texas Air National Guard as an F-102 Delta Dagger pilot of the 111th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, at Ellington Field, Houston Today, the 136th Airlift Wing (136 AW) provides global airlift for Air Mobility Command; the 147th Attack Wing (147 AW) flies the MQ-9 Reaper reconnaissance/strike RPA and the 149th Fighter Wing (149 FW) flies the Block 30 F-16C/D Fighting Falcon tactical fighter-bomber. From 2001 through 2007, elements of every Air National Guard unit in Texas were activated in support of the Global War on Terror. Flight crews, aircraft maintenance personnel, communications technicians, air controllers and air security personnel deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, Qatar, Israel, and other locations throughout Southwest Asia. Additionally, in 2005 elements of all the units were activated to provide relief after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. =Notable former members= * George W.

The district consists of Southeast and South Central Missouri and includes the Bootheel, the Lead Belt and the Ozarks. Emerson is a member of the Republican Party. On January 22, 2013, Emerson resigned her seat in Congress to become the President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. She served as CEO until August 2015. With the defeat of Congressman Ike Skelton, Emerson became the dean, i.e., the longest-serving member, of Missouri's congressional delegation in 2011. Early life, education and career She was born Jo Ann Hermann in Bethesda, Maryland. She was a daughter of Albert \\"A.B.\\" Hermann, who played for the Boston Braves baseball team from 1923‚Äì1924 and was executive director of the Republican National Committee. She graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University.

She was a member of the moderate Republican groups the Republican Main Street Partnership and the Tuesday Group. On May 24, 2005, Emerson was one of 50 Republicans to vote in favor of overturning President George W. Bush's ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. She cast her \\"yea\\" vote the day after her mother-in-law died from Alzheimer's Disease, one of the illnesses for which scientists believe they can create better treatments from stem cell research. On July 12, 2007, Emerson was one of only four Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives who voted to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq by April 2008. On September 15, 2009, Emerson was one of seven House Republicans to vote in favor of the Democrats' proposed resolution to condemn U.S. Representative Joe Wilson (R-South Carolina) for shouting \\"You lie!\\" in the middle of President Barack Obama's joint address to the U.S. Congress on health care reform. Her margins of victory in the district have always been higher than those of GOP presidential candidates George W. Bush and John McCain as well as Republican gubernatorial candidates Kenny Hulshof, Matt Blunt and Jim Talent. Emerson announced in early December 2012 her plans to retire from Congress in February 2013 to assume a position with the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) as its president and Chief Executive Officer. Political campaigns When her husband Bill died in 1996, Jo Ann announced she would run for his vacant seat. However, Missouri state law prohibited her from filing in the Republican primary for the general election. In November, Jo Ann Emerson competed in two elections on the same day. She ran as a Republican against Democrat Emily Firebaugh in the special election to finish the last two months of her late husband's eighth term, and as an independent against Democrat Firebaugh and Republican Richard Kline in the general election for a full two- year term. She won both elections easily and has been reelected seven times without serious difficulty. She is the first Republican woman elected to the U.S. Congress from Missouri. She served the last two months of her husband's term as a Republican, then as an independent caucusing with the Republicans before officially becoming a Republican again at the onset of the new Congress in 1997. She was briefly the first independent elected to federal office in Missouri in 122 years and is the first, and so far only, woman to be elected and serve in Congress as an independent or third party member. Post- political career In August 2015, Emerson took a leave of absence from the NRECA for medical reasons and was succeeded by her former congressional chief of staff and chief operating officer, Jeffrey Connor, in an interim capacity in November, effectively stepping down. In June 2016, former U.S. Representative Jim Matheson was named to succeed Emerson as CEO and took over her post in July. In March 2017, Emerson received the Clyde T. Ellis Award, the highest honor bestowed on an individual by America's electric cooperatives. On her behalf, her husband, Ron Gladney, accepted the award. Personal life Hermann married future U.S. Representative Bill Emerson, a Republican from Cape Girardeau, on June 22, 1975. They had two daughters; Jo Ann also has five stepdaughters and a stepson. Bill was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1980 from Missouri's 10th Congressional District and, subsequent to redistricting, was reelected in 1982 from the 8th District. He died from cancer on June 22, 1996, a few months before the end of his eighth term. The Bill Emerson Memorial Bridge, which links Missouri to Illinois across the Mississippi River, was dedicated to commemorate his efforts to obtain federal funding for its construction. Following Bill's death, Jo Ann married Ron Gladney in 2000. From this marriage she gained two stepdaughters and a stepson. Sometime after leaving the NRECA in 2015, Emerson suffered a stroke while on a family vacation to Italy which left her paralyzed from the neck down. In 2020, while living in the Knollwood retirement community in Washington, D.C., she tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) amid the eponymous pandemic. She later tested negative.

He won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1962 for his novel The Edge of Sadness (1961). His ancestry was Irish, and his novels concerned the Irish-American experience and often dealt with the lives of politicians and priests. (24 March 1968). Prize Winning Author Edwin O'Connor Dies, Oxnard Press-Courier (Associated Press story) Early life O'Connor was born to a medical doctor in Providence, Rhode Island, but was raised in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. He was an alumnus of La Salle Academy and the University of Notre Dame. After graduation, he served in the United States Coast Guard during World War II. In 1946 he began working as a freelance author, selling his stories and reports to numerous magazines, including Atlantic Monthly. Writing career During the 1950s O'Connor began a career as a television critic for two Boston newspapers, a profession he would follow for the remainder of his life. He also published his first novel, The Oracle (1951). Soon afterward, he published the novel for which he is most remembered, The Last Hurrah (1956). The novel concerns a Boston Irish politician, Frank Skeffington, as related by a nephew whom he invites to accompany him on what is an eventually unsuccessful reelection campaign. Skeffington has a gentlemanly manner, lacing his talk with literary quotations. He is slightly corrupt but delivers service to his constituents. He is an expert at balancing the claims of the various Boston-area ethnic groups. However, his time has passed, and he loses the election. While it is not a roman √† clef, there is some similarity between the novel's Skeffington and the real life Boston Mayor James Michael Curley. The novel was adapted for film in 1958, with John Ford directing a screenplay by Frank S. Nugent.Crowther, Bosley. Spencer Tracy in 'The Last Hurrah'; Portrays Skeffington; John Ford Directs.

It is the story of a middle-aged priest in an unnamed New England port city with a cathedral that is probably modeled on Providence, his birthplace. I Was Dancing (1964) is a novel about an aging vaudevillian who tries to become reacquainted with his son after twenty years of casual neglect. His last novel, All in the Family, appeared in 1966. (It has no relation at all to the later television series of the same name.) It is a story of a Massachusetts family with a father who has political ambitions for his sons. As with The Last Hurrah, it is not a roman √† clef but the clan is certainly reminiscent of the Kennedy family. \\"Edwin O'Connor, the author of The Last Hurrah, summed up the era in his final novel, All in the Family: 'Corruption here had a shoddy, penny-ante quality it did not have in other states....Here everything was up for grabs and nothing was too small to steal....In our politics there seemed to be a depthless cushion of street-corner cynicism, a special kind of tainted, small-time fellowship which sent out a complex of vines and shoots so interconnected that even the sleaziest poolroom bookie managed, in some way, however obscure, to be in touch with the mayor's office or the governor's chair.'\\"Howie Carr (2013), The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century, with a new afterword, New York: Grand Central, p. 41, .

France Shoulder insignia of a police inspecteur g√©n√©ral (France) In the French Civil Service, an inspector general (inspecteur g√©n√©ral) is a member of a body of civil servants known as inspection g√©n√©rale, generally of a high level, charged with a nationwide mission to inspect some specific services and provide government officials with advice regarding that service. For example: * Inspection G√©n√©rale des Finances (IGF; Ministry of Finances) * Inspection G√©n√©rale des Affaires Sociales (IGAS; Social Security) * ' (IGA; various administrative departments, e.g. prefectures) * Inspection g√©n√©rale de l'√âducation Nationale (Ministry of National Education: teaching issues) * Inspection g√©n√©rale de l'administration de l'√âducation Nationale (ministries of National Education and Research: administrative issues) * French National Police internal affairs  Inspection g√©n√©rale de la Police Nationale (except Paris and close suburbs)  Inspection g√©n√©rale des services of the Prefecture of Police (Paris and surroundings). The inspection g√©n√©rale des Finances is particularly prestigious as a job appointment after studies at the √âcole Nationale d'Administration. In recent decades, many of its members have occupied various high positions in lieu of their traditional mission of inspection. The corps has come under increased criticism for this. Germany During World War II, Colonel General Heinz Guderian was appointed inspector general of armoured troops on 1 March 1943, reporting directly to Adolf Hitler. Since the reestablishment of the German armed forces after World War II, the inspector general of the federal armed forces (Generalinspekteur der Bundeswehr) is the highest-ranking soldier, responsible for the overall military planning and the principal military advisor to the federal minister of defense and the federal government. Head of the Command Staff of the Armed Forces (F√ºhrungsstab der Streitkr√§fte), his position is broadly equivalent to that of the American chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In the German federal police (Bundespolizei), the highest-ranking police officer is called inspector of the federal police as well, although this position is a more coordinating than commanding one. For all state alert police services there also exists an inspector (Inspekteur der Bereitschaftspolizeien der L√§nder). All of the sixteen German state police departements has an inspector, as the highest-ranking police officer. The state police presidents are normally not police officers, they are administration officials. The competence for police services in Germany is assigned to the federal states of Germany. The federal police is a coordinating police d√©partement with only a few competences, e.g. in border control or airport and trial security. In the scope of responsibility of the state police departments the federal police can only act with permission or request of the local state police. India Insignia of an Indian Police Service officer with rank of inspector general of police During the British rule in India, in 1861, the British Government introduced the Indian Councils Act 1861. The act created a new cadre of police, called Superior Police Services, later known as the Indian Imperial Police. The highest rank in the service was the Inspector General. Currently. in modern India, the inspector general of police or joint commissioner of police is a two-star rank officer and one of the most senior officers in the state police forces. All inspectors general and joint commissioners in state police forces are Indian Police Service officers. They are in some states the commissioner of police for the city, that is they head a police force for a particular city. Inspectors general in Central Armed Police Forces (BSF, CISF, CRPF, SSB, ITBP) are either Indian Police Service (IPS) officers or directly appointed gazetted officers (DAGOs), who are directly appointed Assistant Commandants (through UPSC entrance test from the year 2005 onwards). The rank insignia of an inspector general of police or joint commissioner of police is one star above a crossed sword and baton. The Indian Coast Guard also has the rank of inspector general. The coast guard regions are commanded by officers of the rank of inspector general.

Romania In Romania, inspector general is the title given to the head of the Romanian Police, Romanian Border Police, Romanian Gendarmerie and the Romanian General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations (whose central commands are called \\"general inspectorates\\"). Sweden In the Swedish Armed Forces the inspector general (generalinspekt√∂r or truppslagsinspekt√∂r) was the highest official for a military branch or combat arm. The first arm to have an inspector general was the artillery where the Master-General of the Ordnance had this function since 1634. Inspector general of the cavalry and inspector general of the service troops was founded in the 19th century. The infantry did not get an inspector general until 1914. The engineer troops and signal troops followed in 1937 and a surgeon general in 1941. In 1941 the commander of the coastal artillery was also renamed inspector general of the coastal artillery. In 1998 the previous inspectors general were abolished and the commanders of the major branches (army, air force and navy) was renamed \\"inspector general\\", renamed again to \\"branch inspector\\" in 2003 to resume the title commander in 2014.  Turkey  In Turkey the office of an Inpector General was created in 1927 and disestablished in 1952. He ruled with martial law and over all military, juridical and civilian matters. United Kingdom =Military= In the British tradition, an inspector general is usually a senior military officer responsible for the inspection of military units to ensure that they meet appropriate standards of training and efficiency. Unlike American inspectors general, they do not usually have an investigative or law enforcement function. For many years the Royal Air Force maintained a post of inspector general. =Police= The commanding officers of the Royal Irish Constabulary (and later of the Royal Ulster Constabulary until replaced by chief constable) and many Commonwealth police forces also bore the title of inspector general of police and it is still used in India and some other former British territories.

Inspector and variants of it are rank titles of officers in the police of Britain and most Commonwealth countries. United States logo for the Council of the Inspectors General In the United States, an inspector general leads an organization charged with examining the actions of a government agency, military organization, or military contractor as a general auditor of their operations to ensure they are operating in compliance with generally established policies of the government, to audit the effectiveness of security procedures, or to discover the possibility of misconduct, waste, fraud, theft, or certain types of criminal activity by individuals or groups related to the agency's operation, usually involving some misuse of the organization's funds or credit.

He worked as a lawyer before entering politics, and was a member of the Ukrainian Cultural and Educational Centre, the Canadian Shield Foundation and the Big Brother's Association of Manitoba. Chomiak was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1990 provincial election, in the north Winnipeg riding of Kildonan. He defeated Progressive Conservative candidate David Langtry by 210 votes; Progressive Party leader Sidney Green finished fourth. After the election, Chomiak joined with 19 other NDP MLAs as the official opposition to Gary Filmon's government. Chomiak was re-elected in the 1995 election, defeating Tory Robert Praznik 5812 votes to 3624. He again increased his margin of victory in the 1999 election, defeating PC candidate Shannon Martin by 6101 votes to 2542. The NDP won this election, and Chomiak was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Health and Minister responsible for Sport. He was relieved of responsibility for Sport on January 17, 2001. In 2003, Chomiak supported Bill Blaikie's campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party. In 2003, he was re-elected in the once-marginal riding of Kildonan with over 70% of the vote.

It takes its name from the broadleaf tree, which was once prolific throughout the area, although its most famous tree is the Bucket Tree, a large macrocarpa with the topiary of an upside-down bucket. Tawa is also known for its large number of churches, representing a wide range of Christian denominations. Within Tawa, there are a number of named areas: Lindenvale, Westhaven, Redwood and Southgate to the west and Linden, Greenacres and Sundale to the east of the central Tawa area. Geography and transportation Tawa is located in a wide section of a roughly north/south valley which opens up on the north into the Porirua Basin. The valley is about 4.5 km in length (north to south) and 2.5 km wide (east to west). The Belmont range, to the east, separates the Tawa valley from the Hutt Valley, while the Ohariu Valley is located to the west of Tawa. The northern entrance to Tawa is where Kenepuru Drive becomes Main Road, and its southern entrance is the Tawa exit of the Johnsonville-Porirua Motorway (State Highway 1). The Porirua Stream flows along the valley, fed by a number of tributaries, including the Takapu Stream. Loosely following the path of the Porirua Stream through the valley is the North Island Main Trunk line; the Kapiti Line of the Wellington suburban railway, operated by Tranz Metro. Slightly to the east, the Johnsonville-Porirua Motorway, a dual-carriageway section of State Highway 1, also follows a similar path. Both have played an important role in the suburb's development and in providing access. The literally named Main Road runs down the centre of the suburb and provides access to the smaller suburban streets. Main Road and Kenepuru Drive were part of State Highway 1 before the motorway was built in the 1950s. Tawa is served by the five suburban passenger railway stations of Kenepuru, Linden, Tawa, Redwood and Takapu Road, with a significant number of commuters travelling daily by train into the Wellington CBD to work. As a result, trains are a significant component of Tawa's public transport but the suburb is also served by a bus route linking Porirua and Johnsonville. Despite these bus and train services, a substantial area on Tawa's fringes remain over 400 metres from public transport, particularly in Redwood, Greenacres and Linden. Measured this way, while the parts of Tawa near the railway and Main Road are among the best-served suburbs in Wellington in terms of public transport, these areas on the fringes are among the worst served. As a result, park and ride facilities provided at Takapu Road, Redwood, and Tawa railway stations are normally full on weekdays and parking near Linden station is at a premium with all on-street parks close to the station occupied. In 2009 the Wellington City Council commenced work on a shared pedestrian cycle trail through Tawa to Porirua City Centre. The trail is a combination of new paths following the Porirua Stream and rail corridor and the widening of some existing footpaths. The Wellington City section of the trail, between Takapu Road railway station in the south and Kenepuru railway station in the north, was completed in 2013. The Porirua City section of the trail was built on an existing unsealed trail and completed about March 2014.Cycle & Walking Track Nearly Complete, 5 December 2013 Wellington City Council.

Retrieved 30 December 2016 Name origin and local government Before 1959, \\"Tawa\\" was known as \\"Tawa Flat\\", a reference to the flat and arable floor of the valley as it widened out in the Tawa area. The first known use of the name \\"Tawa Flat\\" was by John Woodman who used it as his address in the Electoral Roll for the Wellington Country District, published in the Wellington Provincial Gazette of 28 August 1854. As others living in the area gave their address in the 1854 roll as \\"Porirua Road\\", it is possible that John Woodman was the originator of the name. When New Zealand became a separate Colony from New South Wales in 1841, the Royal Charter established three provinces. The Tawa area became part of New Munster which included that part of the North Island south of the Patea River and the whole of the South Island. In 1846 the British Parliament passed the first New Zealand Constitution Act which reformed the provinces and the Tawa area became part of New Ulster which now included all of the North Island. The provinces were reformed again with the New Zealand Constitution Act of 1852 which established six provinces with Tawa included in the Wellington Province. Provincial Government was abolished in 1876 and replaced with 36 borough councils and 63 county councils. The Tawa area became part of the Porirua Riding of the Hutt County, formed in 1877. The Hutt County covered all the area south of the Waikanae River and West of the Remutaka Ranges that lay outside of Wellington City. As the population of local areas grew, a number of local boroughs were split off from the Hutt County. In 1908, a smaller Makara County with offices in Porirua was formed from the MƒÅkara and Porirua Ridings or the south-western part of the Hutt County. The new Makara County included Porirua, Titahi Bay, and Tawa Flat, and all of the area to the south lying to the west of Wellington City outside the areas covered by Wellington City and the new and independent boroughs of Miramar, Karori, Onslow, and Johnsonville.The break-up of Hutt County Te Ara The Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Retrieved 22 August 2016 In 1939, northern Tawa valley residents seeking to give a separate name to the northern part of the Tawa district met. They chose \\"Linden\\", from \\"Linden Vale\\", the name of the home of Mr Stuart Duncan, but originally named by Mr. Charles Duncan, a nurseryman. The name \\"Linden\\" was adopted in 1940 and the first Linden railway station was opened on 30 April 1941. In 1948, the Tawa Flat and Linden Progressive Associations and Porirua interests, led by Arthur Carman and Percy Clark, made a representation to the Local Government Commission asking for a single borough covering the whole of the Porirua Basin. The Commission did not accept this proposal but responded by giving the Tawa Flat-Linden area the status of a Town District able to elect its own Town Board. A roll of 1,700 electors was compiled and on 16 May 1951 the first Town board was elected. Urbanisation and population growth continued in the Tawa valley and in 1953 the population had reached 3,900, sufficient for an upgrade of the Town District to a borough. The upgrade to the Borough of Tawa Flat was approved in October 1953. Starting at the time of the Tawa Flat School and Tawa Flat District Centennial in 1955, there was a popular move to change the name of the \\"Borough of Tawa Flat\\" to the \\"Borough of Tawa\\" as more people now lived in the hilly areas on the sides of the valley or in Linden and only a minority lived in the area previously known as Tawa Flat. The New Zealand Geographic Board decided on 24 November 1958 \\"that on and after the 23rd of February 1959 the name of the Borough of Tawa Flat shall be Borough of Tawa.\\" From 1959, the area became known as Tawa and usage of Tawa Flat has been discontinued.Tawa Heritage, Wellington City Libraries. Retrieved 22 August 2016A little about the Tawa Borough Council, tawalink.com. Retrieved 22 August 2016 In 1988 the Local Government Commission proposed that Tawa amalgamate with Porirua City or Wellington City with no option to remain an independent borough allowed. The proposal was opposed by the Tawa Borough Council and a majority of residents. Despite efforts by Porirua City to entice Tawa residents to amalgamate with Porirua City many Tawa citizens indicated a preference for amalgamation with Wellington City. On 3 October 1988, the Local Government Commission decreed that the Borough of Tawa would amalgamate with Wellington City. The Tawa Community Board was set up in 1989 to replace the Borough Council.Tawa LinkTawa's amalgamation angst in 1989 The Dominion May 16, 2016. Retrieved 23 August 2016 Tawa now contributes, as part of Wellington city's Northern Ward, to elect three Wellington city councillors. Tawa retains a Community Board, which represents the suburb in matters of local and community affairs. The former Mayor of Wellington, Kerry Prendergast, originally came on to the Wellington City Council following time as a Tawa Borough councillor. History =Settlement= Tawa Flat was first settled by PƒÅkehƒÅ in the mid-19th century under the direction of Edward Gibbon Wakefield of the New Zealand Company. It was divided into 100-acre blocks, providing some of the 100-acre \\"in the country\\" blocks that accompanied the one-acre \\"in town\\" (i.e., central Wellington) blocks, similar to other New Zealand Company settlements. Much of the eastern side of the Tawa valley came to be owned by a single family until the demand for housing land overtook the benefits of farming the land. In 1951, a Town District was established covering Tawa and Linden. Within two years this had become Tawa Flat Borough. =Development= The development of Tawa, like many population centres, has been strongly tied with the development of transportation networks. Tawa was on the Old Porirua Road, developed from a MƒÅori track to a road in the 1840s. A single track railway line built by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company connected Tawa to Wellington from September 1885, and to Palmerston North from November 1886. It followed a circuitous route from Wellington via the Ngaio Gorge and Johnsonville. This line was incorporated into the New Zealand Railways Department network in December 1908. Tawa's first railway station, Tawa Flat station, opened on 24 September 1885 on what is now Duncan Street on the straight section of road about 180 metres north of the intersection of Duncan Street with the junction of Tawa Street and Tawa Terrace. 1930s and 40s: The Tawa Flat deviation From June 1937, the double-tracked Tawa Flat deviation diverted the North Island Main Trunk railway from Thorndon through Kaiwharawhara and two significant new tunnels to the Tawa valley to provide a shorter faster rail route with easier grades and higher speed curves. The old and new routes diverged in Thorndon and merged again north of the present day Tawa Railway Station near the front entrance to Tawa College. Part of the old rail route through Tawa, from Tawa Street to Tawa College, became the southern part of Duncan Street and the old railway alignment from Tawa Street to Takapu Road remained as a pleasant walking track. The new deviation provided two new railway stations that opened on 20 June 1937, one at Takapu Road and a new Tawa Flat Railway Station on an island platform built on the flat, below and 400 metres north of the old railway station. A crossing loop was provided at Tawa Flat with crossovers north and south of the station that allowed trains to terminate at Tawa Flat and return to Wellington or Porirua. A siding was provided to support local businesses. The new Tawa Flat station was equipped with an enclosed waiting room, toilets for men and women, and a stationmaster's office with a ticket sale window opening to the waiting room. A miniature lever frame allowed signals to be locally controlled. Trains between Kaiwharawhara and Tawa ran on double line automatic signalling and the tablet system remained in use on the single line section from Tawa to Porirua. With the completion of the deviation, the Johnsonville line from Wellington to Johnsonville was electrified and reopened as the Johnsonville Branch. The railway connection between Johnsonville and Tawa was severed on 19 June 1937.John Yonge (editor), New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, fourth edition (Essex: Quail Map Company, 1993), 16. The railway line from Tawa to Porirua remained single track with no stations between Tawa and Porirua until the new Linden station opened on 28 July 1940. Electrification of the North Island Main Trunk was completed from Wellington to Paekakariki in 1940 and a modern automatic signalling system installed to enable trains to operate at frequent intervals. From 1940, the shorter and faster train service to Wellington using passenger cars hauled by electric locomotives made Tawa a more desirable place to live. Arohata Women's Prison, located at the southern end of Tawa, was built in 1944 and was originally a women's borstal. It became a youth prison in 1981 and a women's prison in 1987. 1950s and 60s: improved train service, motorway opening, rapid population growth  A much improved, faster, and more frequent, rail service resulted from the Tawa Flat deviation in the late 1930s, electrification of the railway line with an automatic signalling system in 1940, and the arrival of additional electric multiple units in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The first multiple units operated on the line on 5 September 1949 but electric locomotive hauled trains continued to operate in peak periods as there were insufficient multiple units. It was now quicker and easier for residents of Tawa to commute to Wellington to work in the central Wellington area. Travel time by rail from Tawa to central Wellington was now shorter than from many Wellington City suburbs and the fares were competitive. On 15 December 1957, duplication of the railway line from Tawa to Porirua was completed and a new railway station on an island platform was opened at Linden. With the duplication to Porirua, double line automatic signalling was extended to Porirua and the miniature lever frame controlling the signalling in Tawa could now be \\"switched-in\\" when required for shunting of goods trains or other movements requiring the use of the crossovers or \\"switched-out\\" to automatic double track operation. This meant that Tawa station did not require manning for most through train movements. Two new railway stations were built in the 1960s to meet the growing demand for rail services: Kenepuru station opening on 8 April 1963 and Redwood station on 15 December 1963. Tawa was now served by five railway stations. A feature of the new Redwood station was the staggering of the platforms north and south of the level crossing at Tawa Street to avoid the excessive operation of the warning lights and bells and barrier arms at the Tawa Street level crossing. During the 1950s, the high-speed Johnsonville‚ÄìPorirua Motorway was built through Tawa on the eastern side of the valley. The first section that broadly followed the line of the old North Island Main Trunk railway from Johnsonville to the Tawa turnoff at Takapu Road at the southern entrance to Tawa was opened on 15 December 1951. The second section, from Takapu Road to Porirua, was opened about five years later and the Johnsonville bypass connecting the south end of the motorway to the top of Ngauranga Gorge about the same time. The first section reduced road travel times and considerably improved access to Wellington by eliminating the need to use the narrow winding road through the bottom of the valley and Glenside. The second section allowed through traffic to bypass Tawa reducing traffic on the Main Road in Tawa. The southern and northern accesses to Tawa were improved by straightening and widening narrow sections of the Main Road at Takapu Road and Kenepuru Drive between Linden and Porirua. Demand for new housing diminished in the 1930s and early 1940s, but from the mid-1940s a country-wide surge in marriage and birth rates occurred. With a shortage of suitable new housing areas in Wellington City, and with Tawa now more accessible with improved road and rail access, Tawa became a popular place for new private housing. Land was at a premium in the steep terrain of the Wellington region and the flat areas and moderate hills of Tawa were attractive. The Tawa microclimate, sometimes up to five degrees Celsius warmer than Wellington when the foehn effect occurs at the tail end of a southerly wind, was an added attraction. It could be fine and warm in Tawa when Wellington was cold and overcast. New subdivisions followed and the population expanded rapidly, and Tawa became one of the fastest-growing areas in the country. State housing subdivisions at Kenepuru and Hampton Hill in the late 1950s and early 1960s added to the population growth. Population growth and a need to ensure primary schools were within walking distance for children led to the opening of new schools. A new public primary school was opened at Linden in 1952 to take the pressure off the long-established Tawa School. Tawa College was opened in 1960 eliminating the need for Tawa students to travel to Porirua or into Wellington for Secondary Education. Tawa College was built on land that straddles the motorway, with the main school campus west of the motorway and additional playing fields to the east. A subway under the motorway links the two parts of Tawa College and provides public access. St. Francis Xavier School, a Catholic primary school, opened in Redwood in 1960. The demand for new primary schools continued in the 1960s: Hampton Hill School was opened in 1965 and Redwood School in 1966. 1970s to present day During the 1970s, Tawa experienced significant residential growth, Redwood and parts of Sundale in particular expanded outward. To meet the growth, Greenacres primary school opened in 1972 and Tawa Intermediate in 1975. The opening of Tawa Intermediate took pressure off the primary schools by catering for year 7 and 8 education that was previously provided by the primary schools. Since the 1990s, Tawa has been expanding more slowly. By the turn of the 21st Century, most of the green field residential growth in Tawa has been occurring to the east of the Motorway, mainly spreading eastward up toward the parallel Takapu Valley in the direction of the Belmont Range. Whilst green field residential growth has slowed, there has been significant infill housing as property owners, particularly owners of older quarter acre sections, subdivide their properties. Along with infill housing, the turn of the 21st century has seen the redevelopment of some of Tawa's previously industrial area including the development of Dress Smart - an outlet shopping centre - and the retirement village, Redwood village. Tawa's latest retail development is located on what is colloquially known as \\"Takapu Island\\"; a site located alongside the Tawa motorway off-ramp where a new supermarket was opened in September 2012. Conversely, one of Tawa's other shopping centres, Tawa Junction, closed in 2008 after a lengthy period with few occupants and has since been mooted as a location for another retirement village. On 27 November 1999 Tawa, along with Mount Eden and Mount Roskill, became the last place in New Zealand to vote in favour of becoming \\"wet\\" in local restoration polls. Voting to become \\"wet\\" allowed the purchase of alcohol within the suburb for the first time and since then several pubs and bars have opened.

The U.S. Navy, United States Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard were the only services to ever use enlistment bars. An enlistment bar was similar in appearance to a campaign clasp. The Good Conduct Loop was also a similar decoration, used by the United States Army. Navy The Navy first began issuing enlistment bars in 1884. The bar was pinned to the front of the Good Conduct Medal and listed a sailor‚Äôs duty assignment at the time of the issuance of the Good Conduct Medal. On the reverse of the enlistment bar was the sailor‚Äôs date of discharge. In 1931, the enlistment bar was revamped to display, on the front side only, the sailor‚Äôs date of discharge for the period of Good Conduct service. During the Second World War, enlistment bars were changed again to where the first enlistment bar would denote a subsequent decoration of the Good Conduct Medal. Such bars were inscribed to read ‚ÄúSECOND AWARD‚Äù, ‚ÄúTHIRD AWARD‚Äù and so on. In 1950, the Navy declared enlistment bars to be obsolete and began issuing service stars to denote multiple awards of the Good Conduct Medal. Marine Corps The Marine Corps issued enlistment bars for subsequent awards of the Good Conduct Medal, with the front of the bar displaying the number of the subsequent enlistment and the reverse of the bar displaying the dates of the enlistment for which the Good Conduct Medal was authorized. The Marine Corps discontinued enlistment bars in 1953 and began to use service stars to denote multiple awards of the Good Conduct Medal. Coast Guard Coast Guard enlistment bars were engraved in the same manner as those issued for the Navy Good Conduct Medal. The enlistment bars originally displayed duty assignments on front, with date of discharge on the reverse. During the Second World War, the Coast Guard followed suit with the Navy and began issuing enlistment bars engraved with the number of a subsequent Good Conduct award. The Coast Guard maintained this system until 1966, at which time enlistment bars were declared obsolete and replaced by service stars.

After two years, Jones was released by the Mets, and signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was released by the Pirates before the 1983 season started, thus ending his playing career. His career win-loss record was just ; he remains the only starting pitcher to win a Cy Young Award but retire with a losing record. He was named an All-Star in 1975 and 1976. After his retirement, Jones' uniform No. 35 was retired by the Padres on May 9, 1997. Post-playing career: coaching and catering Padres retired numbers, including Jones' No. 35, at Petco Park After retiring from Major League Baseball, Jones has coached young pitchers. His most prominent pupil was Barry Zito, a former Major League pitcher and the 2002 Cy Young Award winner while with the Oakland Athletics. He also is the owner of Randy Jones All American Grill, Randy Jones Big Stone Lodge, the home of his catering business Randy Jones Buckboard Catering. The Big Stone Lodge sells a barbecue sauce that bears Jones' name. Jones also is involved in the San Diego Padres local radio broadcast pregame and postgame show. In 1996, Jones was inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface. He was inducted as part of the inaugural class of the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 1999.

(1983). \\"Ukita Hideie\\", in Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan, Vol. 8, pp. 137‚Äì138. Son of Ukita Naoie, he married G≈çhime, a daughter of Maeda Toshiie. Having fought against Tokugawa Ieyasu in the Battle of Sekigahara he was exiled to the island prison of Hachij≈ç-jima, where he died. Rise to prominence Hideie's father Naoie was daimy≈ç of Bizen province and initially opposed, but later sided with Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Naoie died in 1581, and in 1582 Hideie became the head of the Ukita clan. As Hideie was still young, it was Hideie's uncle (Ukita Tadaie) who acted as leader of the Ukita army (under Toyotomi Hideyoshi) during the siege of Bitch≈´ Takamatsu Castle in 1582. Nobunaga was assassinated on June 2 of that year, but the siege continued until the castle fell two days later. Hideyoshi raced back to Kyoto, leaving the Ukita clan in charge of Bizen, Mimasaka and newly taken parts of Bitch≈´ Provinces. The Ukita were also to keep watch on M≈çri Terumoto to the west. He participated in the Invasion of Shikoku (1585). In 1586, Hideie was married to Hideyoshi's adopted daughter, G≈çhime. (She had been adopted by Hideyoshi from Maeda Toshiie.) Hideie joined Hideyoshi's military campaigns in Shikoku (1585), and the Siege of Odawara (1590). Following the unification of Japan under Hideyoshi, Hideie served as a chief commander in the Second Korean campaigns, returning in 1598 to serve as one of Hideyoshi's five counselors, along with Maeda Toshiie, Uesugi Kagekatsu, M≈çri Terumoto, and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Ukita Hideie hata-jirushi (left) Battle of Sekigahara Hideyoshi died in 1598, leaving his five-year-old son Hideyori as his successor and Tokugawa Ieyasu moved to take control. As he was very close to Hideyoshi, Ukita naturally sided with the Toyotomi loyalists under Ishida Mitsunari (the Western army). He took 17,000 men to fight in the Battle of Sekigahara. His army fought against Fukushima Masanori in what is said to have been one of the bloodiest confrontations in the battle. Ukita's troops were winning the battle, pushing back Masanori's army however, being unaware that his allies stationed nearby had made a secret deal with the enemy, his momentum was halted when his allies attacked and together with turncoats, Masanori's army took control of and won the battle. One of the defectors, Kobayakawa Hideaki, was granted Okayama Castle and surrounding Ukita territories by the Tokugawa as a reward for his betrayal, which is believed to have been the decisive factor in the Tokugawa victory. Hideie was angered by the betrayal and initially intended to hunt down Kobayakawa for a man-to-man duel but was stopped by his advisors. After escaping the battle, he went into hiding in Satsuma Province where his former allies protected him for several years. In 1603 however, Shimazu Tadatsune informed the Tokugawa shogunate of Hideie's location, and he was forced to appear before Tokugawa himself where he was sentenced to exile on the island of Hachij≈ç-jima, along with several supporters, including his two sons. Hideie's wife sought refuge with the Maeda clan and was able to correspond and send gifts (rice, sake, clothing) to her husband and sons from there. Hideie eventually outlived his wife and all of the Sengoku Jidai era samurai except Sanada Nobuyuki. He was offered a conditional pardon after Ieyasu's death, but declined and never returned to the mainland. His wife had died, the Toyotomi were defeated, there was no place to return to, his sons had fathered children on Hachijojima, and the Shogunate was to be inherited by members of the Tokugawa clan. There is no evidence to suggest that Hideie fathered any further children himself, but many of his sons' descendants emigrated back to the Japanese mainland when a full pardon was granted at the end of the Edo era.

Its major strength is the accurate calculation of atomic and molecular energies as well as properties using many-body techniques such as many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and, in particular coupled cluster techniques to treat electron correlation. The development of ACES II began in early 1990 in the group of Professor Rodney J. Bartlett at the Quantum Theory Project (QTP) of the University of Florida in Gainesville. There, the need for more efficient codes had been realized and the idea of writing an entirely new program package emerged. During 1990 and 1991 John F. Stanton, J√ºrgen Gau√ü, and John D. Watts, all of them at that time postdoctoral researchers in the Bartlett group, supported by a few students, wrote the backbone of what is now known as the ACES II program package. The only parts which were not new coding efforts were the integral packages (the MOLECULE package of J. Alml√∂f, the VPROP package of P.R. Taylor, and the integral derivative package ABACUS of T. Helgaker, P. Jorgensen J. Olsen, and H.J. Aa. Jensen). The latter was modified extensively for adaptation with Aces II, while the others remained very much in their original forms. Ultimately, two different versions of the program evolved. The first was maintained by the Bartlett group at the University of Florida, and the other (known as ACESII-MAB) was maintained by groups at the University of Texas, Universitaet Mainz in Germany, and ELTE in Budapest, Hungary. The latter has recently been renamed as CFOUR. Aces III is a parallel implementation that was released in the fall of 2008. The effort led to definition of a new architecture for scalable parallel software called the super instruction architecture. The design and creation of software is divided into two parts: # The algorithms are coded in a domain specific language called super instruction assembly language or SIAL, pronounced \\"sail\\" for easy communication. # The SIAL programs are executed by a MPMD parallel virtual machine called the super instruction processor or SIP. The ACES III program consists of 580,000 lines of SIAL code of which 200,000 lines are comments, and 230,000 lines of C/C++ and Fortran of which 62,000 lines are comments.

Biddle was born in Philadelphia in 1750. He began sailing at the age of 13 and joined the Royal Navy when he was 20. In 1773, he sailed the Arctic with Constantine Phipps and Horatio Nelson. When the Revolutionary War began in 1775, Biddle joined the Continental Navy and commanded several ships. In 1778 off the coast of Barbados, Biddle confronted , a 64-gun British warship. After a twenty-minute battle, Biddle's ship suddenly exploded, killing him and most of his men. Four ships of the U.S. Navy have been named in his honor. Early life Nicholas Biddle was born in Philadelphia in 1750, one of nine children to William Biddle (1698‚Äì1756) of the Biddle family, and Mary Scull (1709‚Äì1789). Biddle went to sea at the age of thirteen, as a ship's boy aboard a merchant vessel trading to the West Indies. In 1770 he joined the Royal Navy and served three years until resigning in 1773 to accompany Captain Constantine Phipps on his expedition to the Arctic Sea. While on this voyage Biddle became acquainted with Horatio Nelson, the future British admiral and fellow member of Phipps' expedition. American Revolutionary War In 1775 Biddle returned to North America to offer his services to the State of Pennsylvania in opposing British rule. With the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, the Pennsylvania Committee of Safety placed Biddle in command of the armed galley . In December 1775, Biddle was commissioned into the Continental Navy and made captain of the 14-gun brig . Biddle participated in the expedition against New Providence, and fought in the Continental Navy's action with on April 6, 1776. Biddle was highly critical of the action, noting that the lack of signalling by Commodore Esek Hopkins led to a \\"helter skelter\\" action. Biddle would later capture numerous vessels, including British army transports, on later cruises. Biddle later participated in a cruise of the Newfoundland Banks that was so successful in the taking of ships, that when Biddle returned to port he had only five sailors left on board his ship; the rest were crewing the prizes taken during the cruise. On June 6, 1776, Biddle was appointed by the Continental Congress to command , a 32-gun frigate then being built in Philadelphia. She was launched near the close of the year, and sailed early in 1777. In September 1777, Biddle captured and her three-ship convoy. On March 7, 1778, off Barbados, Randolph engaged the British 64-gun ship of the line . Rather than trying to flee from the more heavily armed opponent, Randolph engaged in battle in order to protect an American merchant convoy. An eyewitness reported the frigate held her own in the twenty-minute engagement, appearing, \\"to fire four or five broadsides to the Yarmouths one.\\" After Biddle was wounded, Randolph blew up suddenly, killing all but four of the 305 on board including Biddle. The loss of Randolph was a serious blow to the fledgling Continental Navy. His body was lost at sea and never recovered. His brother, Edward Biddle, was a staunch advocate for American independence, and his nephew, Nicholas Biddle, was an esteemed banker. Four ships of the United States Navy have been named in his honor. Cyrus Townsend Brady's book For Love of Country is based partly on the life of Nicholas Biddle.  In popular culture  Nicholas Biddle appears in the video game Assassin's Creed III as the primary target of the Naval Missions and the templar captain of during the American Revolution.

Lawes Lewis Edward Lawes (September 13, 1883 ‚Äì April 23, 1947) was a prison warden and a proponent of prison reform. During his 21-year tenure at Sing Sing Correctional Facility, he supervised the executions of 303 prisoners. Biography Lawes was born on September 13, 1883 in Elmira, New York. He was the only child of Henry Lewis Lawes (died 1925) and Sarah Abbott. His father worked as a prison guard at the New York State Reformatory, now called the Elmira Correctional Facility. Lawes ran away at 17 and joined the United States Coast Artillery. Afterwards, he worked at an insurance company before beginning his prison career as a guard at Clinton Prison in Dannemora, New York on March 1, 1905. On September 30, 1905, he married Katherine Stanley. He subsequently worked at first Auburn Prison, then Elmira Reformatory. In March 1915 he was named Superintendent of the City Reformatory on Hart Island in New York City. Lawes became warden of the Massachusetts State Prison in 1918. New York Governor Al Smith asked him to take over as Warden of Sing Sing. Lawes took charge on January 1, 1920. He was featured on the cover and in an article of Time magazine issue of November 18, 1929. His wife, Kathryn (1887-1937), died on October 31, 1937 at Ossining Hospital after she fell at the Cortlandt, New York end of the Bear Mountain Bridge. The heel of her shoe was caught between two boards and it caused her to fall and break her leg. She wasn't found until nighttime and she died from hypothermia. He remained at his post as Warden of Sing Sing for twenty-one years, instituting reforms, until he retired on July 16, 1941. He was replaced by Robert J. Kirby. Lawes became the president of the Boy Rangers of America in 1941. Lawes died of a cerebral hemorrhage on April 23, 1947 at age 63 in Garrison, New York. He was interred at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York. Writings Lawes wrote several books. Several of his works were made into films. His most famous book, Twenty Thousand Years in Sing Sing, was made into a 1932 movie under the same title, starring Spencer Tracy, and again in 1940 as Castle on the Hudson, featuring John Garfield. Over the Wall was produced in 1938 based on the life of one of his inmates, Alabama Pitts. Invisible Stripes in 1939, with George Raft, was based on his novel of the same name, while Humphrey Bogart starred in You Can't Get Away with Murder in 1939, an adaptation of Chalked Out, a play Lawes co-wrote.

He helped popularize Ukrainian music around the world. His name is sometimes transliterated as Oleksandr Koshyts (). At one time, a performance of Koshetz's Ukrainian National Chorus held the world record for audience attendance, excluding sporting events. His performance also popularized Mykola Leontovych's \\"Shchedryk\\" in his concert, which Peter Wilhousky later translated into the popular \\"Carol of the Bells\\". Biography = Early life and career = Koshetz was born in the village of Romashky in Kiev Guberniya. He graduated from the Kiev Theological Academy in 1901, then studied in the Lysenko School of Music and Drama, 1908‚Äì1910. He taught choral music at Kiev's Imperial Conservatory of Music, conducted the Sadovsky Theatre Orchestra, served as conductor and choirmaster of the Kiev Opera.Koshyts, Oleksandr article in the Encyclopedia of Ukraine. Last updated 2009. He also collected Ukrainian folk songs from central Ukrainian areas (notably around Kiev itself) as well as from the modern Russian area of Kuban, where he specially set out to see whether musical traditions of the Dnieper Cossacks are still present in their descendants, the Kuban Cossacks, who resettled there following the dissolution of the Zaporozhian Sich. In the latter case he too managed to collect a number of songs.–û–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –ö–æ—à–∏—Ü—å Article about Oleksandr Koshyts by Roman Koval = Ukrainian Republic Capella and emigration = Koshetz with the Ukrainian National Chorus, c. 1922-1924 After World War I, Koshetz was the co-founder and conductor of the Ukrainian Republic Capella (later renamed Ukrainian National Chorus). The choir toured Europe and the Americas in 1919‚Äì1924 and 1926‚Äì27, in support of the international Ukrainian community. In 1917 Koshetz married a former student and singer in his choirs Tetyana Koshetz (1892‚Äì1966) who was later to become a vocalist in the Ukrainian National Chorus, voice teacher, and after 1944 curator of the Ukrainian Cultural and Educational Centre in Winnipeg. It was Koshetz who introduced the song \\"Shchedryk\\" by Mykola Leontovych, at a concert in Kiev in 1919. Eventually the song became a Christmas classic under the name \\"Carol of the Bells\\". He moved to New York City in 1922 where he collected liturgical music, arranged and popularized Ukrainian folk music.

She won the Pulitzer Prize for her 1984 novel Foreign Affairs. Although better known as a novelist, she has also written numerous non-fiction books and articles, particularly on children's literature and the semiotics of dress. Personal life Lurie was born in Chicago but grew up in White Plains, New York, the daughter of Bernice (Stewart) and Harry Lawrence Lurie, a Latvian- born professor. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1947.\\"Biography Profile: Alison Lurie\\" Marquis Who's Who on the Web The next year she married Jonathan Peale Bishop, then a graduate student at Harvard. Bishop was a critic and essayist who, in the 1970s and later, became a writer of autobiographically-inflected books about Catholic Christianity. He taught at Amherst College, in Massachusetts (1957‚Äì61), and then at Cornell University (1961‚Äì). Lurie moved along with him. Lurie and Bishop have three sons; they divorced in 1985 after a long separation. She is currently married to the writer Edward Hower. She spends part of her time in London, part at Cornell, and part in Key West, Florida. In 1970, Lurie began to teach in the English Department at Cornell, where she was tenured in 1979. She taught Children's Literature (a new field in the 1970s) and writing. In 1989 she was named the F. J. Whiton Professor of American Literature at Cornell and is now a professor emerita. Fiction Lurie's published novels: * Love and Friendship (1962). Emmy Stockwell Turner and Miranda Fenn, two faculty wives at the all- male elite and isolated Convers College, juggle their love and friendship for their husbands and for a womanizing composer. *The Nowhere City (1965). Paul Cattleman, history grad student, moves to L.A. to work for the military- industrial complex and finds that neither the company nor his beatnik mistress has a sense of history; he returns to Harvard. His wife however, with the help of a womanizing psychiatrist, frees herself from disabling fears and decides to stay. *Imaginary Friends (1967). Roger Zimmern, a young sociology professor at an upstate New York university (Corinth), helps a senior professor investigate a group of small-town individuals who are receiving messages from Ro of the planet Varna. * Real People (1969). The writer Janet Belle Smith, wife of Clark Stockwell II, spends a summer at Illyria, an artist's colony, along with assorted poets, artists, musicians, and the critic Leonard Zimmern. In sorting out her platonic from her sexual love affairs, she realizes she needs to write about Illyria, even though that means she can never return there. *The War Between the Tates (1974). *Only Children (1979). In 1936, nine-year-old Mary Ann Hubbard (Miranda Fenn) and Lolly Zimmern (Lorin Jones), along with Lolly's teenaged half-brother Leonard, spend a Fourth of July in the country with their parents and a teacher. The parents flirt and contemplate adultery while the children learn what they can about themselves and the world. *Foreign Affairs (1984); Pulitzer Prize. *The Truth About Lorin Jones (1989); Prix Femina √âtranger. Polly Alter, divorced with a teenage son and attracted to a group of lesbians, is trying to write the story of the long-dead artist Lorin Jones. Was she a victim whose painting suffered from a series of overbearing men in her life, or an opportunist who exploited men to further her painting? Polly studies the New York art scene, New England elite college friends and teachers, Zimmern relatives, the ex-husband at Cape Cod, and the ex-lover in Key West. *Women and Ghosts (1994). A collection of nine short stories (or ten: a retelling of the myth of Medea ‚ÄúSomething Borrowed, Something Blue,‚Äù is not in all editions, but is available online) in which several female protagonists confront extreme emotional states, the unexplained and the supernatural. All settings are contemporary. Locales include New York, New England, London, Key West and New Delhi. Among the characters who narrate or figure in the stories are Ruth and Celia Zimmern, Gary Mumpson, Janet Belle Smith and assorted Stockwells, and Miranda Fenn. Miranda's son Charles marries Celia, Leonard Zimmern's daughter, in the story \\"In the Shadow.\\" The daughter of the beatnik (proto-hippie) Tylers of \\"Nowhere City\\" has married Clark Stockwell III, Janet's son, in \\"Waiting for the Baby.\\" Five stories appeared previously in various magazines.Lurie, Alison. Women and Ghosts. New York: Doubleday. 1994 *The Last Resort (1998). The naturalist Wilkie Walker allows his wife Jenny to remove him from Convers College to Key West, with the idea that the latter place might be favorable for suicide. Jenny on the other hand hopes he will continue to work on his books, on which she quietly collaborates. Jenny finds love with Lee Weiss (a Zimmern cousin) at Artemis Lodge, and Wilkie decides he might as well live. Barbie and Myra Mumpson are concerned about Myra's gay nephew. *Truth and Consequences (2006). Corinth University architecture professor Alan MacKenzie hurts his back at a department picnic and life changes for him and his wife Jane. They get some help from Bernie Kotelchuck and his wife Danielle (formerly Zimmern). After a period of balancing giving and receiving care, they find new loves in the visiting author Delia Delaney and her husband. Under Delia's influence, Alan becomes an artist. =Themes and characters= Lurie's novels, with their light touch and focus on portraying the emotions of well-educated adulterers, bear more resemblance to some 20th-century British authors, (e.g. Kingsley Amis, David Lodge) than to the big American authors of her generation.E.g. ‚ÄúComedies of Manners, Laced with Morals,‚Äù review of ‚Äò‚ÄôLast Resort‚Äô‚Äô by Mel Gussow, New York Times 9/5/1998: \\"...she has more in common with English authors from Evelyn Waugh to David Lodge than she does with many of her American contemporaries.\\". Her titles and the saga-like intertwining of her characters suggest high ambitions. Love and Friendship, the title of her first published novel, is shared with an early novel by Jane Austen; it takes on the problem of the American college as initiation rite into manhood, and the awkwardness of the role therein assigned to women. The next title, The Nowhere City, evokes both Thomas More‚Äôs Utopia (Greek for \\"nowhere\\") and Gertrude Stein‚Äôs comment about Oakland, California, \\"There is no there there.\\" Utopias are the subject of Imaginary Friends and Real People: the small group of spiritualists examined by a sociologist and the small group of artists examined by a writer. The War between the Tates and Foreign Affairs imply by their titles parallels between academic adulteries and political upheavals. The Truth about Lorin Jones and Truth and Consequences take us back to the problem of truth-telling, both in life and in art. A number of Lurie's characters are, like her, born in 1926, give or take a few years: Lorin Jones and Mary Ann/Miranda Fenn,Lorin Jones‚Äôs birth year is mentioned in Truth about Lorin Jones, p. 43 (Little, Brown hb edition), and she and Mary Ann are the same age. Janet Belle Smith (42 in Real People, 1969), Erica Tate (40 in 1969 and like Lurie a Radcliffe B.A.), Vinnie Miner (54 in Foreign Affairs, 1978, and like Lurie a professor of children's literature), and Wilkie Walker (70 in Last Resort, 1998). Since these characters have also followed Lurie from Amherst/Convers to Los Angeles to Cornell/Corinth and to London and Key West, inevitably one considers the possibility that some at least of these characters represent the author herself. Janet Belle Smith (Real People) and Delia Delaney (Truth and Consequences) are rather pretentious writers of whom Lurie makes fun some of the time, but they also reflect aspects of her experience as a writer.Lurie‚Äôs relation to Janet is obviously complex; in the biographical note printed in Real People, she dissociates herself explicitly from Janet, saying she herself is an \\"insensitive lady novelist\\" as opposed to sensitive Janet. At the same time, Janet‚Äôs experiences of Illyria presumably reflect Lurie‚Äôs own at Yaddo, and both make the decision to write about this forbidden topic and so be cast out of paradise. Janet toys during the first part of Real People with the idea of writing a series of ghost stories, one of which involves a fat ghost; Lurie‚Äôs only volume of short stories is called Women and Ghosts (1995) and this includes one called \\"Fat People.\\" Delia in Truth and Consequences, a highly theatrical Southern writer who seems far from Lurie‚Äôs character or persona, also writes ghost stories. One feels that Lurie‚Äôs ambivalence with regard to her heroines is what makes them so sharp and moving. =Adaptations= * The War Between the Tates was adapted as a television movie for NBC in 1977. It starred Elizabeth Ashley and Richard Crenna. *Imaginary Friends was adapted as a Thames Television series in 1987. The setting was moved from upstate New York to the English coast. *Foreign Affairs was adapted as a television movie in 1993, starring Joanne Woodward, Brian Dennehy, and Eric Stoltz.

Lip balm often contains beeswax or carnauba wax, camphor, cetyl alcohol, lanolin, paraffin, and petrolatum, among other ingredients. Some varieties contain dyes, flavor, fragrance, phenol, salicylic acid, and sunscreen. Overview The primary purpose of lip balm is to provide an occlusive layer on the lip surface to seal moisture in lips and protect them from external exposure. Dry air, cold temperatures, and wind all have a drying effect on skin by drawing moisture away from the body. Lips are particularly vulnerable because the skin is so thin, and thus they are often the first to present signs of dryness. Occlusive materials like waxes and petroleum jelly prevent moisture loss and maintain lip comfort while flavorings, colorants, sunscreens, and various medicaments can provide additional, specific benefits. Lip balm can be applied where a finger is used to apply it to the lips, or in a lipstick-style tube from which it can be applied directly. Lip balm was first marketed in the 1880s by Charles Browne Fleet, though its origins may be traced to earwax. More than 40 years prior to the commercial introduction of lip balm by Fleet, Lydia Maria Child recommended earwax as a treatment for cracked lips in her highly-popular book, Child observed that, \\"Those who are troubled with cracked lips have found this earwax remedy successful when others have failed. It is one of those sorts of cures, which are very likely to be laughed at; but I know of its having produced very beneficial results.\\"  Notable brands  * Burt's Bees * Blistex * Carmex * ChapStick * Labello * Lip Smacker * Lypsyl * EOS  Dependency  Some physicians have suggested that certain types of lip balm can be addictive or contain ingredients that actually cause drying. Lip balm manufacturers sometimes state in their FAQs that there is nothing addictive in their products or that all ingredients are listed and approved by the FDA. Snopes found the claim that there are substances in Carmex that are irritants necessitating reapplication, such as ground glass, to be false.Lip Balm entry on snopes.com  Mineral oil  In 2015, German consumer watchdog Stiftung Warentest analyzed cosmetics containing mineral oils. After developing a new detection method they found high concentrations of Mineral Oil Aromatic Hydrocarbons (MOHA) and even polyaromatics in products containing mineral oils with Vaseline products containing the most MOHA of all tested cosmetics (up to 9%). The European Food Safety Authority sees MOHA and polyaromatics as possibly carcinogenic. Based on the results, Stiftung Warentest warns not to use Vaseline or any product that is based on mineral oils for lip care.

Schaefer, III (University of Georgia). Utilizing Psi, one can perform a calculation on a molecular system with various kinds of methods such as Hartree-Fock, Post-Hartree‚ÄìFock electron correlation methods, and Density functional theory. The program can compute energies, optimize molecular geometries, and compute vibrational frequencies. The major part of the program is written in C++, while Python API is also available, which allows users to perform complex computations or automate tasks easily. Psi4 is the latest release of the program package - it is open source, released as free under the GPL through GitHub. Primary development of Psi4 is currently performed by the research groups of David Sherrill (Georgia Tech), T. Daniel Crawford (Virginia Tech), Francesco Evangelista (Emory University), and Henry F. Schaefer, III (University of Georgia), with substantial contributions by Justin Turney (University of Georgia), Andy Simmonett (NIH), and Rollin King (Bethel University). Psi4 is available on Linux releases such as Fedora and Ubuntu. Features The basic capabilities of Psi are concentrated around the following methods of quantum chemistry: * Hartree‚ÄìFock method * Density functional theory * M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset perturbation theory * Coupled cluster * CASSCF * multireference configuration interaction methods * symmetry-adapted perturbation theory Several methods are available for computing excited electronic states, including configuration interaction singles (CIS), the random phase approximation (RPA), time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), and equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CCSD). Psi4 has introduced the density-fitting approximation in many portions of the code, leading to faster computations and reduced I/O requirements.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1999 to 2016, and served as cabinet minister in the provincial governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger from 2003 to 2013. Rondeau is a member of the New Democratic Party. Rondeau did not seek re-election in the 2016 Manitoba election. Early life and career The son of Gaston Joseph Rondeau and Dorothy Jean Finch, he was born in Winnipeg, and was educated at John Taylor Collegiate. He holds a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of Winnipeg and has completed post-baccalaureate studies at the University of Manitoba. He was a teacher at Norway House High School from 1981 to 1984 and later taught at Cranberry Portage, before becoming coordinator of the Frontier School Division at the University of Winnipeg. Rondeau helped establish several learning centres and libraries throughout the province,Nick Martin, \\"Summer reading in cards for pupils\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 May 2002, A4; Nick Martin, \\"Literacy programs reap happy harvest\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 September 2002, A12. and founded a school-to-work transition program for young people from northern Manitoba.Allison Bray, \\"Getting a feel for the job\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 March 1996, A10. He also coached the Winnipeg Eagles Volleyball Club, and was coach and manager of the Manitoba Volleyball team in several North American Aboriginal Games.Aldo Santin, \\"Everything isn't just Ducky\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 April 1995; Marvin MacDonald, \\"Young swimmer's showing earns spot on national team\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 July 1993; Kim Guttormson, \\"Politicians jump at chance to aid Games' success\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 August 2002, A7. Politician =Government backbencher= Rondeau was first elected to the Manitoba Legislature in the 1999 provincial election with a dramatic victory in the west-end Winnipeg riding of Assiniboia, previously regarded as safe for the Progressive Conservative Party. On election night, the final vote totals showed Progressive Conservative incumbent Linda McIntosh winning re-election by two votes.\\"Northwest Winnipeg\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 September 1999, B3. After the institutional ballots were counted, however, Rondeau was declared elected by six votes.\\"Institutional vote bolsters to NDP majority\\", Globe and Mail, 25 September 1999, A5; David Kuxhaus, \\"NDP gains another seat\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 September 1999.

Rondeau indicated that one of the disqualified votes was marked with a happy face symbol instead of an \\"X\\". Rondeau entered the legislature as a backbench supporter of Gary Doer's government, and soon became known as a strong constituency worker.David Kuxhaus, \\"Manitoba Tories start long march to recapturing key PC constituency\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 September 2002, A4. He kept a strong interest in educational issues, and was a frequent participant in debates at the St. James-Assiniboia School Board.Some board members resented his involvement. See \\"School board feuding with MLA Rondeau interfering: St. James chairman\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 October 2000, A12. He represented the provincial government at Manitoba's 2001 Hire a Student Day event,\\"Looking for summer help?

Rondeau also played an important role in assuring passage of the provincial Canadian Forces Personnel Act. Rondeau is the first openly gay member of the Manitoba legislature, and was the keynote speaker of Winnipeg's 2000 Gay Pride Parade.\\"Exhibits, events highlight gay week\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 June 2000, A8. He encouraged the Doer government to introduce full legal equality for gay and lesbian couples during its first term, and strongly supported 2002 legislation that ensured full equality for all common-law relationships.\\"NDP gallops ahead on gay rights\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 June 2002, A14. He later became a vocal supporter of same-sex marriage, which was legalized in Canada in 2005.Patti Edgar, \\"300 rally to back gay marriage\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 October 2003, A3. Rondeau has said that his sexual orientation has never been controversial in his constituency, once telling a journalist, \\"People don't care one way or the other. I'm surprised, pleasantly surprised, that people don't make it an issue.\\"Aldo Santin, \\"NDP in fight for hard-won seat\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 May 2003, A11. Rondeau supported Jack Layton for the leadership of the federal New Democratic Party in 2003. =Minister of Healthy Living= Rondeau's narrow victory in 1999 made his seat a key Progressive Conservative target in the 2003 election, but he was re-elected with 63% of the vote, winning every poll but one. In November 2003, he was appointed as Minister of Healthy Living within the Department of Health, with special responsibility for Seniors and Healthy Child Manitoba. He became a strong advocate for public awareness and preventative medicine,Mia Rabson, \\"New minister taking a healthy approach\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 December 2003, B5. and indicated that the Doer government would consider removing the provincial sales tax from nutritional supplements and alternative foods.Daniel Lett, \\"Healthier foods may get PST break\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 May 2004, B5. In December 2003, Rondeau announced that Manitoba would ban all smoking from indoor public places and workplaces within a year. The initiative was described as the most ambitious anti-smoking strategy in Canada, and a February 2004 poll showed that many smokers were considering quitting in light of the ban.\\"Can province enforce smoking ban?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 November 2003, B2; Leah Janzen, \\"Ban spurs smokers to quit: poll\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 February 2004, A3.

The bill exempted tobacco shops as well as native reserves and casinos, which the government argued were outside provincial jurisdiction.Mia Rabson, \\"Smoking ban 'historic'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 March 2004, A1; \\"Smokers won't be completely out in the cold once Manitoba's new anti-smoking law takes effect\\", Broadcast News, 4 March 2004, 19:23. In March 2004, Rondeau announced that the Doer government had signed a $2.5-million contract to create a Prostate Centre at CancerCare Manitoba.Mia Rabson, \\"Cancer battle given boost\\", Winnipeg Free Press, B7. He later handled negotiations concerning whether or not the Manitoba government would provide funding for an abortion clinic in Winnipeg.Patti Edgar, \\"Clinic asks province to pay for abortions\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 April 2004, A3. Despite some initial reluctance, he announced in July 2004 that the government would fully fund abortions at Jane's Clinic, once owned by Henry Morgentaler.Daniel Lett, \\"Province funding abortions at clinic\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 July 2004, A1. In late April 2004, he announced that the provincial government would pay for child vaccinations against chicken pox, meningitis and pneumococcus.Mia Rabson, \\"Children will get vaccines for free\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 April 2004, A1. Rondeau and Fort Garry representative Kerri Irvin-Ross co-chaired public hearings on Manitoba's privacy laws in May 2004.\\"Privacy laws under attack\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 May 2004, A3. Later in the year, he announced that the government would establish a \\"Healthy Kids, Healthy Futures\\" committee of the legislature.Mia Rabson, \\"Government wants to get kids off the couch\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 September 2004, A4. =Minister of Industry, Economic Development and Mines= Rondeau was promoted to a full cabinet portfolio on October 12, 2004, as Minister of Industry, Economic Development and Mines. He indicated that Manitoba had the potential for strong economic growth in the mining sector, particularly in light of the need for raw materials in countries such as India and China. He also announced that he would work to reduce government bureaucracy in the sector, and make it easier for mining projects to get underway.Geoff Kirbyson, \\"Miners locate optimism\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 November 2004, C9. The mining sector reported dramatic growth in 2005, highlighted by a new investment from Inco and a new gold mine project in Bissett.Murray McNeill, \\"Mining exploration soars in province\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 July 2005, B7; Tara Perkins, \\"Inco to develop new nickel ore body at the Thompson mine in Manitoba\\", Canadian Press, 29 August 2005, 15:14; Bill Redekop, \\"Bissett going for gold: Biggest mine to open in 15 years creates jobs, hope\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 November 2005, B6.

He also expanded oil exploration in the province, removing the sales tax for drilling and exploration equipment.Martin Cash, \\"Province to eliminate sales tax on oil exploration equipment\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 March 2006, B5. Manitoba's oil sector grew at a record level in 2006, with 478 new wells started.Mia Rabson, \\"Oil industry shatters record 478 new wells dug last year in Manitoba\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 January 2007, A3. In 2004-05, Rondeau accused the federal government and federal Health Minister Ujjal Dosanjh of undermining Manitoba's online pharmaceutical industry, which was then shipping large quantities of medication to the United States of America.Mia Robson, \\"Feds would kill city jobs to safeguard drug supply\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 December 2006, A1. He argued that the government should compensate Manitoba for lost jobs if it chose to shut down the sector.Paul Egan, \\"Pay up for lost Net jobs, feds told\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 January 2005, A1. Rondeau later indicated that he would support a ban on bulk exports to America, but added that government intervention appeared to be unnecessary in any event.Michelle MacAfee, \\"Online pharmacists hope to make fresh start with new Tory government\\", Canadian Press, 5 February 2006, 15:57. As Industry minister, Rondeau was responsible for overseeing the troubled Crocus Investment Fund and faced difficult questions relating to the fund's management in early 2005.Paul Egan, \\"Ministers rebuff call to dump Crocus director\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 April 2005, A3. He acknowledged that the province was responsible for regulating Crocus, but argued that it had no involvement in the fund's day-to- day operations.\\"Man. government won't be named in class-action suit by Crocus shareholders\\", Canadian Press, 9 July 2005, 21:03; Larry Kusch, \\"Crocus class action won't touch province\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 July 2005, A1. =Minister of Science, Technology, Energy and Mines= After a cabinet shuffle on September 21, 2006, Rondeau was reassigned as Minister of Science, Technology, Energy and Mines. Soon after his appointment, he announced that the Doer government would spend $70M to clean up the province's abandoned mines.Mia Rabson, \\"$70M set aside to clean up toxic mine sites\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 September 2006, A6. Rondeau criticized the environmental strategy of Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government in late 2006, saying that Harper was not moving as assertively as had the previous government of Paul Martin.Paul Samyn, \\"Manitoba pans green plan East-west grid isn't mentioned\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 October 2006, A5. Notwithstanding this criticism, he indicated in early 2007 that Manitoba's share of a $1.5 billion federal Eco-Trust and Clean Air Fund will be at least $50 million, and could reach $100 million.Mia Rabson, \\"Province has wish list for federal green cash\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 February 2007, A3. He has said that the money will go to developing hydrogen technology for buses and providing energy efficiency programs for low-income Manitobans. Rondeau supports a proposed east-west Canadian power grid, and has endorsed the federal government's plan for a national ban on inefficient incandescent light bulbs by 2012.Dennis Bueckert, \\"Lights out for incandescent bulbs\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 April 2007, A9. In February 2007, he announced that anyone who registers an energy- efficient hybrid vehicle in Manitoba between 15 November 2006 and 15 November 2008 will receive a $2,000 rebate from the provincial government.Steve Pona, \\"Provincial rebates offered for hybrids\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 February 2007, B7. Rondeau was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election, as the New Democratic Party won a third consecutive majority government. He retained his position as Minister of Science, Technology, Energy and Mines, and was also appointed as interim Minister of Competitiveness, Training and Trade, a position he held until February 2008. Rondeau has said that Manitoba would neither raise Hydro rates nor implement a carbon tax to promote conservation, arguing that the goal could be achieved by other means.Mia Rabson, \\"Sierra Club says hike hydro rates and tax polluters\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 June 2007, 4. He announced a \\"pause\\" on further uranium exploration permits the following month, after health and environmental concerns were raised by the Northlands Dene First Nation.Dan Lett, \\"Dene seek to halt uranium exploration\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 July 2007, 5. He has also indicated that the provincial and federal governments will spend over half a million dollars to expand a biodiesel testing laboratory in Manitoba Hydro's East Selkirk plant,David Kuxhaus, \\"Biodiesel lab to get $614,000\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 July 2007, A13. and has announced legislation to encourage further growth within the sector.\\"Biofuels development in Manitoba would move forward with proposed changes to legislation\\", eSource Canada Business News Network, 11 October 2007. In late 2007, he wrote an editorial piece in support of a government policy requiring that 8.5% of the total volume of gasoline sold in Manitoba is to be ethanol. The mandate will take effect in 2008.Jim Rondeau, \\"Let's welcome new biofuel era\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 October 2007, B6.

The feature was filmed in Ultra Panavision 70 and exhibited in 70 mm Cinerama. Battle of the Bulge had its world premiere on December 16, 1965, the 21st anniversary of the titular battle, at the Pacific Cinerama Dome Theatre in Hollywood, California. The filmmakers attempted to condense the Ardennes Counteroffensive, a World War II battle that stretched across parts of Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg and lasted nearly a month, into under three hours, and shot parts of the film on terrain that did not resemble actual battle locations. That left them open to criticism for lack of historical accuracy, but they claimed in the end credits that they had \\"re-organized\\" the chronological order of events to maximize the dramatic story. Unlike most other World War II epics, Battle of the Bulge contains virtually no portrayals of actual senior Allied leaders, civilian or military. That is presumably because of controversies surrounding the battle, both during the war and afterward. Allied forces ultimately won the battle, but the initial German counteroffensive caught them by surprise and caused many casualties. Plot In December 1944, Military Intelligence officer and former policeman Lt. Col. Daniel Kiley (Fonda) and his pilot, Joe (Robert Woods), are flying a reconnaissance mission over the Ardennes forest. Spotting a German staff car, the plane buzzes the car and photographs the officer. Alarmed, the chauffeur flees the car, leaving the engine running. \\"Petrol is blood,\\" rebukes the German officer, marking a theme of the film, the German shortage of fuel. In a subterranean lair, it is revealed the officer is Col. Martin Hessler (Robert Shaw), a fictional Panzer tank commander who is loosely based on SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Jochen Peiper. Hessler is briefed by his superior, Gen. Kohler (Werner Peters), on a new German attack, piercing west against the American lines. Kohler points out a clock with a 50-hour countdown, which is the time allotted for the operation beyond which Germany has no resources for a full-scale attack. At the same time, German soldiers disguised as American troops, led by Lt. Schumacher (Ty Hardin), are tasked with seizing vital bridges and sowing confusion behind Allied lines. Meanwhile, Kiley returns to headquarters, where he warns that the Germans are planning another all-out offensive. His superiors, Gen. Grey (Robert Ryan) and Col. Pritchard (Dana Andrews), dismiss it out of hand since all available intelligence points to Germany not having the resources and manpower to launch another attack. Hessler, having become concerned about the abilities of his tank commanders after his orderly, Conrad (Hans Christian Blech), points out the staggering losses that Germany has sustained since the war began, reviews them, and discovers they are all young and lacking in experience. Overhearing his criticism, the commanders break into a chorus of Panzerlied, restoring Hessler's faith. Hoping to uncover more proof, Kiley visits an American infantry position on the Siegfried Line under the command of Maj. Wolenski (Charles Bronson). A patrol led by Lt. Weaver (James MacArthur) and Sgt. Duquesne (George Montgomery) capture some young and obviously-inexperienced German soldiers. Kiley concludes that experienced German troops have been replaced by these men and withdrawn for an offensive, but Pritchard dismisses that as well, rebukes Kiley for \\"crackpot hunches,\\" and is determined to relieve him of duty. Hessler launches his attack the next day. Awakened by the noise of German tanks, Wolenski leads his men into the wooded area of the Schnee Eifel, where they try to fight them off but are overrun. A group of Allied tanks, led by Sgt. Guffy (Telly Savalas), also attempts to slow the Panzers, but their tanks' weak guns and thin armor make them ineffective and so force him and his crew to retreat. On the trip back to Ambl√®ve, Guffy enlists one of his crew to help move black market goods from a nearby farmhouse before they fall into enemy hands. Lt. Schumacher and his disguised troops capture the only bridge over the Our River that can carry heavy tanks. Hessler continues his spearhead toward Ambl√®ve while he is observed by Kiley, who also discovers that a German truck is carrying empty fuel drums. Just before the Germans attack the town, Guffy finds Louise (Pier Angeli), his business partner, and they split the proceeds of their racket. As Guffy departs for the coming battle, Louise confesses her love for him, and he does the same for her. Schumacher later takes control of a vital intersection of three roads that connect Ambl√®ve, Malmedy, and the Siegfried Line. He sabotages the road signs, and the rear echelon of Wolenski's troops takes the wrong road to Malmedy. Almost the entire unit is captured and massacred by SS troops. Lt. Weaver manages to escape, but Duquesne is killed. US soldiers become suspicious when they witness Schumacher's \\"military police\\" lay explosives incorrectly on the Our bridge, and his masquerade is revealed although it is too late to stop Hessler. When Kohler orders Hessler to bypass Ambl√®ve, Hessler replies that the Americans have no concept of defeat and cites that they will ship things as trivial as a fresh chocolate cake to their front-line troops. He feels he can break their will to fight, and Kohler gives him the night to do so. Hessler's tanks and infantry storm Ambl√®ve and finally take the town. Although many Americans, including Wolenski, are captured, Grey, Pritchard, Kiley, and others escape to the Meuse River. American forces regroup and begin to reorganize for a counterattack. Guffy learns that Louise died in the German assault on Ambl√®ve. Facing the dangers of a foggy night, Col. Kiley conducts an aerial reconnaissance in an attempt to locate the main German spearhead. He orders Joe to shut off the engine and to glide in an attempt to listen for enemy tanks. Suddenly, through a gap in the fog, he spots Hessler's tank column heading toward American lines. Kiley radios in the coordinates, but his plane is hit by German fire and crashes near an American fuel depot, killing Joe and wounding Kiley. In Hessler's command vehicle, Conrad finally confronts the Colonel about his warmongering ways after Hessler boasts about the war going on forever and so Conrad's sons will have to become soldiers and fight. Hessler responds by transferring his longtime orderly to the fuel battalion, rather than having him shot for defeatist talk. Meanwhile, Gen. Grey's forces, with the Meuse at their back, prepare to fight off Hessler. The outgunned and underarmored American tanks are systematically destroyed, but the Germans expend much of their fuel. Guffy encounters Weaver, who has taken command of a small force of wounded men. The surviving Americans head to the depot, the same one in which the wounded Kiley is recovering. Aware of the German fuel shortages, Hessler leads a company of Tigers toward the fuel depot to capture its stocks, with Conrad watching him go. Weaver and the stragglers arrive first. Weaver recognizes Lt. Schumacher, still posing as American Military Police, whose men have taken control of the depot; but Schumacher fails to recognize him. At Weaver's signal, he and his men open fire on the disguised Germans and kill all of them. As Hessler's column approaches, the American defenders flood the road with gasoline and set it ablaze. The young German crews abandon their machines in terror, only to be either shot by the Americans or consumed by the flames. Abandoned by his crew, Hessler goes it alone, only for his tank to be exploded by a burning fuel drum. Grey arrives in time to see the Panzers burn. Out of fuel, the remaining Germans give up the attack and march back to Germany. Conrad, bringing up the rear, discards his rifle and cartridge belt and confidently marches on, his personal war is over.  Cast   Historical inaccuracies  The aviation reconnaissance scenes with Henry Fonda were filmed with one or more Cessna L-19 aircraft, which did not fly until December 1949. The scenes could not have been filmed with a Piper L-4, which was widely used during World War II, since the L-4 did not have an electric starter on the engine. It had to be started on the ground by someone pulling the propeller. Page 9, Technical Order 01-140DA-1, Pilot's Flight Operating Instructions - L-4A and L-4B The final tank battle is a rough depiction of the Battle of Celles on December 26, 1944, where the U.S. 2nd Armored Div. smashed the German 2nd Panzer Division. The film creates the false impression that large numbers of American tanks sacrificed themselves against heavy Tiger IIs and, in the process, lured the enemy off course, which caused them to run out of gas. In reality, they were already stranded. The tanks that were used, despite the claims of the producer in an interview in one of the DVD extras, are not historically accurate. Although the M24 Chaffee light tanks used in the scene were World War II-era vehicles, they were not used in the scale shown in the film but were relatively rare. The US M47 Pattons representing German King Tiger tanks and the M4 Shermans, as represented by the M24 Chaffees, contributed much to the myth of the superior size and firepower that US armor had to contend with. In World War II, although it was true that tank for tank, the Tiger II was superior to the Sherman, most of the anti-tank duties were actually the task of the tank destroyer units. Aside from the initial American encounters with the German offensive is the absence of cold weather and snow in which the real battle was fought. There is no trace of snow at all in the film's major tank battle scene, and some battle scenes were fought in flat and bare territory, unlike the mountainous, forested and grassy nature of the Ardennes. The film was shot on location in the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range and Madrid, Spain. The sequence with Schumacher and his men was based on Operation Greif, the plan to parachute English-speaking Germans using American equipment behind American lines to sow confusion and capture the bridges. Absent from the movie is the response by General Patton, whose Third Army relieved the siege of Bastogne. Also, there are no African-Americans in the movie even though the 761st Tank Battalion (The Black Panthers) played a role in Patton's Third Army. Indeed, there is no reference to British forces in the area although British troops were largely kept behind the Meuse River and thus almost entirely out of the fighting. Also not mentioned is General Eisenhower's decision to split the Bulge front into two, transferring temporary command of two American armies to Field Marshal Montgomery in the northern half of the Bulge; the film implies an all-American operation. There is also no mention of the role of Allied air power in hitting the Germans hard at the first sign of clear weather. In fact, in the film, the sky during the battle is clear and partly cloudy. The film's opening narration, by William Conrad, mentions both Montgomery and Patton but is inaccurate: \\"to the north, stood Montgomery's Eighth Army. To the south, Patton's Third Army.\\" In fact, Montgomery's northern command was actually the 21st Army Group. The Eighth Army, Montgomery's previous command, was actually in Italy at the time of the Battle of the Bulge. Although Patton actually was in charge of Third Army during the battle, it was part of a much larger American force in the south and was one of four American armies of the 12th Army Group under General Omar Bradley. The film recaptures the major aspects of the battle by depicting how the inexperienced replacement American units stationed in the Ardennes were initially overwhelmed and how confused the situation became. The film points out the superiority of heavy German tanks and their major weakness, a lack of fuel. Some early scenes, showing discussions among German officers, accurately depict the Third Reich's desperation to cut American-British supply lines to neutralize the Allies' huge logistical advantage. The characters of Kiley and Hessler were loosely based on Colonel \\"Monk\\" Dickson and Waffen-SS officer Joachim Peiper. However, both names were changed, as the fictional characters bore marked differences from their real-life inspirations. For example, Peiper did not die in a tank attack but lived until he was murdered by vigilantes in 1976.

It was the first commercial aircraft to be built in Czechoslovakia and was known as the Ae-10 Limousine. It was designed by Husnik and Vlasak and was intended to meet the growing need for aerial communication to and from the country. Behind the single nose-mounted engine was a cabin with seats for three and two tables, upholstered on the underside, and able to be inverted to provide another two seats if required. A double skinned firewall between the engine and cabin, together with double skinned surfaces to the walls, floor and roof and Triplex windows gave a (relatively) quiet ride. A rear window gave communication with the pilot, whose open cockpit was above and behind the cabin. The cockpit also accommodated the navigator who had a seat directly behind the pilot. The upper wings were in three sections with the small center section mounted on a tubular cabane and the lower wings were attached directly to the fuselage. Balanced ailerons were fitted to the top plane only and the petrol tank was fitted in the centre section. The fuselage was a deep rectangular section tapering to a vertical knife-edge at the rear, thus rendering a tail fin unnecessary. The tailplane carried two balanced elevators hinged to the stabilisers, and a balanced rudder was fitted to the top of the fuselage. The first example of the A.10 flew for the first time on 3 January 1922. The A.10 was important as one of ƒåeskoslovensk√© St√°tn√≠ Aerolinie - (Czechoslovak State Airlines) first aircraft, with five examples in service with the airline from the time of its inception in 1923 until 1928, on the Prague to Bratislava route.

Either \\"goal difference\\" or \\"points difference\\" is used, depending on whether matches are scored by goals (as in ice hockey and association football) or by points (as in rugby union and basketball). Early example of goal average being used to compare the performances of football clubs (March 1885) Goal difference (or points difference) is calculated as the number of goals (or points) scored in all league matches minus the number of goals or points conceded. Goal difference was first introduced as a tiebreaker in association football, at the 1970 FIFA World Cup, and was adopted by the Football League in England five years later. It has since spread to many other competitions, where it is typically used as either the first or, after tying teams' head-to-head records, second tiebreaker. Goal difference has often replaced the older goal average, or goal ratio. Goal average means the number of goals scored divided by the number of goals conceded. It was replaced by goal difference, which was thought to encourage more attacking play, encouraging teams to score more goals (or points) as opposed to defending against conceding. However goal average is still used as the tiebreaker in Australian rules football where it is referred to as \\"percentage\\". This is calculated as points scored divided by points conceded, and then multiplied by 100. If two or more teams' total points scored and goal differences are both equal, then often goals scored is used as a further tiebreaker, with the team scoring the most goals winning. After this a variety of other tiebreakers may be used. Goal difference v. goal average The different schemes can lead to strikingly different results. With the following matches: \\\\ \\\\ Under goal average, Team A would win: Under goal difference, Team B would win: Goal average was replaced by goal difference due to the former's encouragement of lower-scoring games. For example, a team that scores 70 while conceding 40 would have a lesser goal average (1.750) than another team that scores 69 while conceding 39 (1.769). Or, for the team that has scored 70 while conceding 40, conceding another would reduce the goal average by 0.043 (to 1.707), whereas scoring another would increase it by only 0.025 (to 1.775), making not conceding much more important than scoring again. Another issue with goal average is that, if a team has conceded no goals (e.g. Group 1 of the 1966 World Cup), the value cannot be calculated, as division by zero is undefined. Titles decided on goal difference =Netherlands top-flight= 2007, PSV Eindhoven and Ajax Heading into the final day of the 2006‚Äì07 Eredivisie season, three teams were still in contention to win the title, and with it a guaranteed place in the 2007‚Äì08 UEFA Champions League. PSV, looking to win their third straight league title, was the only one of the three to play its final match at home, against Vitesse Arnhem. Ajax, looking to win their first title since 2004, traveled to Willem II, while AZ faced Excelsior looking to win its first league title since 1981, after finishing in the top three in the previous two seasons. These final matches were played on April 29, 2007. AZ struggled against Excelsior (who would have to go through a relegation play-off after the end of the game) as they played almost 72 minutes of the match with only 10 men, as goalkeeper Boy Waterman was red- carded in the 18th minute. AZ came from behind twice, with Danny Koevermans tying the match in the 70th minute with his 22nd goal of the season. AZ had a chance to take the lead after its numerical disadvantage was leveled as Excelsior's Rene van Dieren was sent off for yellow card accumulation. AZ never took advantage and a goal from Johan Voskamp in the 90th minute gave Excelsior a shock 3‚Äì2 win. Meanwhile, in Tilburg, Ajax took the lead in the 18th minute with a goal from Urby Emanuelson. Ajax added a second goal in the 69th minute as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored his 21st goal of the season. Meanwhile, PSV scored twice in the first 10 minutes, but gave up a goal three minutes later and led only 2‚Äì1 at half-time. In the second half, Ibrahim Afellay scored in the 58th minute before another goal from Jefferson Farfan made the score 4‚Äì1 to PSV. Following Huntelaar's 69th-minute goal, PSV and Ajax were level on points and goal difference, but Ajax had a superior goals scored. But in the 77th minute, Philip Cocu put PSV up 5‚Äì1 and the team was up on goal difference (+50 to Ajax's +49). The scores stayed that way at full time, and so PSV won the 2006‚Äì07 Eredivisie in one of the most exciting finishes to a season in recent memory. =Iceland top-flight=  2010, Brei√∞ablik UBK, √çBV and FH Hafnarfj√∂r√∞ur  The 2010 √örvalsdeild season concluded on September 25, 2010, and three teams were still in contention to win the league title. Leading the table was Brei√∞ablik, based in K√≥pavogur, who knew that a win would give them their first ever league title. Trailing one point behind were √çBV from Vestmannaeyjar, who were looking to win their fourth league title, but its first since 1998. In third place was two-time defending champions FH, looking to win the league title, but trailing Brei√∞ablik by only two points. Brei√∞ablik traveled to Stjarnan and were held to a scoreless draw, but would get encouraging news. Playing their final game at Keflav√≠k, √çBV were losing 2‚Äì0 with 16 minutes remaining when Denis Sytnik scored for √çBV to cut the deficit to 2‚Äì1. But two late goals from Keflav√≠k's Magn√∫s √ûorsteinsson and Bojan Ljubicic denied √çBV a chance to overtake Brei√∞ablik, as √çBV lost to Keflav√≠k by 4‚Äì1. Meanwhile, a draw opened the door for FH as they traveled to Reykjav√≠k to face Fram needing to overturn an 11-goal difference. FH got two goals from Gunnar Kristjansson and a third from Atli Vi√∞ar Bj√∂rnsson (which would tie him with two players for the league lead with 14 goals). However, the 3‚Äì0 victory was not enough to deny Brei√∞ablik their first ever league title. =England top-flight= 2012, Manchester City and Manchester United The 2011‚Äì12 Premier League was generally a two- horse race contested between Manchester City and Manchester United for most of the season, with both clubs finishing 19 points ahead of third-placed Arsenal. City and United went into their final matches of the season level on points, but with City in first-place due to a goal difference superior by +8. The final matches were relegation threatened Queens Park Rangers at home for City, and Sunderland away for United. City were strong favourites, with United's manager Alex Ferguson stating City would have to do 'something stupid' not to beat QPR. A Manchester City win would guarantee the title due to a realistically unassailable superior goal difference. If not a win, then City just needed to match United's result at the Stadium of Light against Sunderland. United scored in the 20th minute, winning 1‚Äì0. City scored two goals in injury time to come from behind and win 3‚Äì2. 1989, Arsenal and Liverpool Arsenal won the league championship on goals-scored, after finishing level on points and goal-difference with Liverpool in the 1988‚Äì89 season. Arsenal defeated Liverpool 2‚Äì0 in the final game of the season to win the championship. =Hungary top-flight= 2014, Debreceni VSC and Gy≈ëri ETO FC Ahead of the final day of the 2013‚Äì14 Nemzeti Bajnoks√°g I season, Debrecen was on course to win its 7th league title since 2005 as its closest competitor Gyor had to overturn a 14-goal swing on the final matchday. Despite losing its season-finale 2‚Äì0 to Budapest Honved FC, Debrecen won the title as Gyor only won 5‚Äì0 against already-relegated Mez≈ëk√∂vesd-Zs√≥ry SE. =England lower division titles decided on goal difference= 1983‚Äì84, Second Division ‚Äì Chelsea‚ÄìSheffield Wednesday Chelsea 88 points and goal difference 50, Sheffield Wednesday 88 points and goal difference 38. 1989‚Äì90, Second Division ‚Äì Leeds United‚ÄìSheffield United Leeds United 85 points and goal difference 27, Sheffield United 85 points and goal difference 20. 1981‚Äì82, Third Division ‚Äì Burnley‚ÄìCarlisle United Burnley 80 points and goal difference 21, Carlisle United 80 points and goal difference 15. 2016‚Äì17, League 2 ‚Äì Portsmouth-Plymouth Argyle Portsmouth 87 points and goal difference 39, Plymouth 87 points and goal difference 25. (N.B. in 1996‚Äì97 Wigan Athletic and Fulham finished level on 87 points at the top of the Third Division, but Wigan Athletic were awarded the championship on most goals scored, which was the first tie breaker in use in the Football League between 1992 and 1999, although Fulham had the greater goal difference. Coincidentally Brighton and Hove Albion avoided relegation from the same division on goals scored at the expense of Hereford United, although Hereford had the better goal difference. It reverted to the Goal Difference method from the start of the 1999‚Äì2000 season.) =Scotland= 1986, Premier Division ‚Äì Hearts‚ÄìCeltic In 1986, Hearts lost 2‚Äì0 at Dundee on the final day of the season, which allowed Celtic to win the league championship on goal difference. Had the first tie-breaker been goal average, Hearts would have won the championship. 2003, Premier League ‚Äì Old Firm Rangers won the Scottish Premier League in 2003 on goal difference. In the final round of matches, Rangers played Dunfermline, while second-placed Celtic were playing at Kilmarnock. With Celtic and Rangers level on 94 points going into these matches, the Championship would be decided by which team, Celtic or Rangers, performed best during the final round of matches. If both teams won they would each finish on 97 points, and the League would be decided on goal difference. Rangers won 6‚Äì1 and Celtic won 4‚Äì0, which left Rangers with a goal difference of 73 (101 for and 28 against), and Celtic a goal difference of 72 (98 scored and 26 against) giving Rangers the title. Titles decided on goal average =England top-flight= 1953, First Division‚ÄìArsenal-Preston North End In the 1952‚Äì53 Football League Championship, Arsenal and Preston North End both finished on 54 points. Arsenal won the title with 97 goals for to 64 against, for an average of 1.516. Preston's 85 to 60 gave 1.417. =England lower divisions= 1950, Second Division‚ÄìSheffield United-Sheffield Wednesday Going into the last game of the 1949‚Äì50 season, Sheffield Wednesday needed a result against Tottenham Hotspur to secure second place and clinch promotion at the expense of their local rivals Sheffield United. The resulting 0‚Äì0 draw meant Wednesday won promotion by a goal average difference of just 0.008 ‚Äì a 1‚Äì1 draw would have left the two level on points and goal average, and a unique play-off match would have had to be played. =Scotland= 1953, Division A ‚Äì Rangers‚ÄìHibernian Rangers drew their last match of the 1952‚Äì53 season, against Queen of the South, 1‚Äì1, to finish level with Hibernian on 43 points. They won the title with a goal average of 80‚Äì39 to 93‚Äì51 (2.051 to 1.824). 1965, First Division ‚Äì Hearts‚ÄìKilmarnock Entering the final day of the 1964‚Äì65 season, Hearts were two points ahead of nearest rivals Kilmarnock, with two points awarded for a win. Hearts played Kilmarnock at Tynecastle in the last game, with Kilmarnock needing a 2‚Äì0 victory to win the league championship on goal average. Hearts could afford to lose 1‚Äì0 or 2‚Äì1, but lost 2‚Äì0 and Kilmarnock won the championship by a goal average of 1.88 to 1.84. Had goal difference been in use, Hearts would have been champions. =Yugoslavia= 1951, First League ‚Äì Red Star Belgrade‚ÄìDinamo Zagreb Red Star Belgrade won the 1951 Yugoslav First League championship ahead of Dinamo Zagreb with a 0.013 better goal average. Dinamo's final match against BSK Belgrade ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw, and the following day Red Star defeated Partizan 2‚Äì0, meaning that both teams finished on 35 points. Red Star's 50 goals for and 21 against gave a goal average of 2.381, while Dinamo's 45 to 19 gave 2.368. 1958, First League ‚Äì RNK Split‚ÄìBuduƒánost In the 1957‚Äì58 Yugoslav First League championship, RNK Split and Buduƒánost finished the season leveled on points and goal average. Both teams had 25 points, with Buduƒánost's 30 goals for and 36 against giving a goal average of 0.833, the same as RNK Split's 35 goals for and 42 against. A two-legged play-off match between the two was needed to decide who will enter relegation play-offs. The match in Split ended in a goalless draw, while in the return leg Buduƒánost defeated RNK Split 4‚Äì0. RNK Split entered the relegation play-offs and was relegated in their first season in the top flight.

It consists of a sealed glass tube with four electrodes. A small triggering pulse on the grid electrode switches the tube on, allowing a large current to flow between the cathode and anode electrodes. The vacuum version is called a vacuum krytron, or sprytron. The krytron was one of the earliest developments of the EG&G; Corporation. Description Unlike most other gas switching tubes, the krytron conducts by means of an arc discharge, to handle very high voltages and currents (reaching several kilovolts and several kiloamperes), rather than the low-current glow discharge used in other thyratrons. The krytron is a development of the triggered spark gaps and thyratrons originally developed for radar transmitters during World War II. The gas used in krytrons is hydrogen;\\"Trapping Low Energy in an Ion Trap\\" Harvard Ph.D. Thesis of Xiang Fei (Defended 10 May 1990), Chapter 4 noble gases (usually krypton), or a Penning mixture can also be used.Silicon Investigations Pulse Power Switching & EG&G; Krytron Tube Replacement Page. Siliconinvestigations.com (2010-02-22). Retrieved on 2010-06-05. Operation Diagram of a Krytron A krytron has four electrodes. Two are a conventional anode and cathode. One is a keep-alive electrode, arranged to be close to the cathode. The keep-alive has a low positive voltage applied, which causes a small area of gas to ionize near the cathode. High voltage is applied to the anode, but primary conduction does not occur until a positive pulse is applied to the trigger electrode (\\"Grid\\" in the image above). Once started, arc conduction carries a considerable current. The fourth is a control grid, usually wrapped around the anode, except for a small opening on its top. In place of or in addition to the keep-alive electrode some krytrons may contain a very tiny amount of radioactive material (usually less than of nickel-63), which emits beta particles (high-speed electrons) to make ionization easier. The radiation source serves to increase the reliability of ignition and formation of the keep-alive electrode discharge. The gas filling provides ions for neutralizing the space charge and allowing high currents at lower voltage.Krytron information on Tube Collector site The keep-alive discharge populates the gas with ions, forming a preionized plasma; this can shorten the arc formation time by 3‚Äì4 orders of magnitude in comparison with non-preionized tubes, as time does not have to be spent on ionizing the medium during formation of the arc path. The electric arc is self-sustaining; once the tube is triggered, it conducts until the arc is interrupted by the current falling too low for too long (under 10 milliamperes for more than 100 microseconds for the KN22 krytrons). Krytrons and sprytrons are triggered by a high voltage from a capacitor discharge via a trigger transformer, in a similar way flashtubes for e.g. photoflash applications are triggered. Devices integrating a krytron with a trigger transformer are available. =Sprytron= A sprytron, also known as vacuum krytron or triggered vacuum switch (TVS), is a vacuum, rather than gas-filled, version. It is designed for use in environments with high levels of ionizing radiation, which might trigger a gas-filled krytron spuriously. It is also more immune to electromagnetic interference than gas filled tubes. Sprytrons lack the keepalive electrode and the preionization radioactive source. The trigger pulse must be stronger than for a krytron. Sprytrons are able to handle higher currents; krytrons tend to be used for triggering a secondary switch, e.g., a triggered spark gap, while sprytrons are usually connected directly to the load. The trigger pulse has to be much more intense, as there is no preionized gas path for the electric current, and a vacuum arc must form between the cathode and anode. An arc first forms between the cathode and the grid, then a breakdown occurs between the cathode‚Äìgrid conductive region and the anode.Pulse Power Switching Devices. Electricstuff.co.uk. Retrieved on 2010-06-05. Sprytrons are evacuated to hard vacuum, typically 0.001 Pa. As kovar and other metals are somewhat permeable for hydrogen, especially during the 600 ¬∞C bake-out before evacuation and sealing, all external metal surfaces have to be plated with thick (25 micrometers or more) layer of soft gold. The same metallization is used for other switch tubes as well.Evaluation of non- cyanide gold plating process for switch tubes, Sandia Report, 1996 Sprytrons are often designed similar to trigatrons, with the trigger electrode coaxial to the cathode. In one design the trigger electrode is formed as metallization on the inner surface of an alumina tube. The trigger pulse causes surface flashover, which liberates electrons and vaporized surface discharge material into the inter-electrode gap, which facilitates formation of a vacuum arc, closing the switch. The short switching time suggests electrons from the trigger discharge and the corresponding secondary electrons knocked from the anode as the initiation of the switching operation; the vaporized material travels too slowly through the gap to play significant role. The repeatability of the triggering can be improved by special coating of the surface between the trigger electrode and the cathode, and the jitter can be improved by doping the trigger substrate and modifying the trigger probe structures. Sprytrons can degrade in storage, by outgassing from their components, diffusion of gases (especially hydrogen) through the metal components, and gas leaks through the hermetic seals; an example tube manufactured with internal pressure of 0.001 Pa will exhibit spontaneous gap breakdowns when the pressure inside rises to 1 Pa. Accelerated testing of storage life can be done by storing in increased ambient pressure, optionally with added helium, for leak testing, and increased temperature storage (150 ¬∞C) for outgassing testing. Sprytrons can be made miniaturized and rugged., Miniature triggered vacuum switches for precise initiation of insensitive loads in demanding environments, e2v 2012 Sprytrons can be also triggered by a laser pulse. In 1999 the laser pulse energy needed to trigger a sprytron was reduced to 10 microjoules.Stockpile Stewardship and Management ? United States Nuclear Forces. Globalsecurity.org. Retrieved on 2010-06-05. Sprytrons are usually manufactured as rugged metal/ceramic parts. They typically have low inductance (10 nanohenries) and low electrical resistance when switched on (10‚Äì30 milliohms). After triggering, just before the sprytron switches fully on in avalanche mode, it briefly becomes slightly conductive (100‚Äì200 amperes); high-power MOSFET transistors operating in avalanche mode show similar behavior.

Performance This design, dating from the late 1940s, is still capable of pulse-power performance that even the most advanced semiconductors (even IGBTs) cannot match easily. Krytrons and sprytrons are capable of handling high-current high-voltage pulses, with very fast switching times, and constant, low jitter time delay between application of the trigger pulse and switching on. Krytrons can switch currents of up to about 3000 amperes and voltages up to about 5000 volts. Commutation time of less than 1 nanosecond can be achieved, with a delay between the application of the trigger pulse and switching as low as about 30 nanoseconds. The achievable jitter may be below 5 nanoseconds. The required trigger pulse voltage is about 200‚Äì2000 volts; higher voltages decrease the switching delay to some degree. Commutation time can be somewhat shortened by increasing the trigger pulse rise time. A given krytron tube will give very consistent performance to identical trigger pulses (low jitter). The keep-alive current ranges from tens to hundreds of microamperes. The pulse repetition rate can range from one per minute to tens of thousands per minute. Switching performance is largely independent of the environment (temperature, acceleration, vibration, etc.). However, the formation of the keep-alive glow discharge is more sensitive, which necessitates the use of a radioactive source to aid its ignition. Krytrons have a limited lifetime, ranging, according to type, typically from tens of thousands to tens of millions of switching operations, and sometimes only a few hundreds. Sprytrons have somewhat faster switching times than krytrons. Hydrogen-filled thyratrons may be used as a replacement in some applications. Applications Krytrons and their variations are manufactured by Perkin-Elmer Components and used in a variety of industrial and military devices. They are best known for their use in igniting exploding-bridgewire and slapper detonators in nuclear weapons, their original application, either directly (sprytrons are usually used for this) or by triggering higher-power spark gap switches. They are also used to trigger thyratrons, large flashlamps in photocopiers, lasers and scientific apparatus, and for firing ignitors for industrial explosives. Export restrictions in USA Because of their potential for use as triggers of nuclear weapons, the export of krytrons is tightly regulated in the United States. A number of cases involving the smuggling or attempted smuggling of krytrons have been reported, as countries seeking to develop nuclear weapons have attempted to procure supplies of krytrons for igniting their weapons. One prominent case was that of Richard Kelly Smyth, who allegedly helped Arnon Milchan smuggle 15 orders of 810 krytrons total to Israel in the early 1980s. 469 of these were returned to America, with Israel claiming the remaining 341 were \\"destroyed in testing\\". Krytrons and sprytrons handling voltages of 2,500 V and above, currents of 100 A and above, and switching delays of under 10 microseconds are typically suitable for nuclear weapon triggers.Technologies underlying weapons of mass destruction DIANE Publishing In popular culture A krytron was the \\"MacGuffin\\" in Roman Polanski's 1988 film Frantic.

The scientific name refers to the East Indies, the species' natural habitat. In the Malay language, the tapir is commonly referred to as cipan, tenuk or badak tampung.bin Momin Khan, Mohd Khan. \\"Status and Action Plan of the Malayan Tapir (Tapirus indicus)\\" Tapirs: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan published by IUCN Tapir Specialist Group, 1997, page 1 General appearance and characteristics The animal is easily identified by its markings, most notably the light-colored patch that extends from its shoulders to its rear end. It is covered in black hair, except for the tips of its ears, which, as with other tapirs, are rimmed with white. This pattern is for camouflage; the disrupted coloration makes it more difficult to recognize it as a tapir, and other animals may mistake it for a large rock rather than prey when it is lying down to sleep.Woodland Park Zoo Animal Fact Sheet: Malayan Tapir (Tapirus indicus) Skeleton Photo of a Malayan tapir skull on display at the Museum of Osteology The Malayan tapir grows to between in length, not counting a stubby tail of only in length, and stands tall. It tipically weighs between , although some adults can weigh up to .Wilson & Burnie, Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife. DK ADULT (2001), Tapirus indicus, Animal Diversity WebAsian Tapir , Arkive The females are usually larger than the males. Like other tapir species, it has a small, stubby tail and a long, flexible proboscis. It has four toes on each front foot and three toes on each back foot. The Malayan tapir has rather poor eyesight, but excellent hearing and sense of smell. Underside of front (left) and back (right) hooves of the Malayan tapir It has a large sagittal crest, a bone running along the middle of the skull that is necessary for muscle attachment. It also possesses unusually positioned orbits, an unusually shaped cranium with the frontal bones elevated, and a retracted nasal incision. All of these modifications to the normal mammal skull are, of course, to make room for the proboscis. This proboscis caused a retraction of bones and cartilage in the face during the evolution of the tapir, and even caused the loss of some cartilages, facial muscles, and the bony wall of the nasal chamber. =Vision= Malayan tapirs have very poor eyesight, making them rely greatly on their excellent sense of smell and hearing to go about in their everyday lives. They have small, beady eyes with brown irises on either side of their faces. Their eyes are often covered in a blue haze, which is corneal cloudiness thought to be caused by repetitive exposure to light. Corneal cloudiness is a condition in which the cornea starts to lose its transparency. The cornea is necessary for the transmitting and focusing of outside light as it enters the eye, and cloudiness can cause vision loss. This causes the Malayan tapir to have very inadequate vision, both on land and in water, where they spend the majority of their time. Also, as these tapirs are most active at night and since they have poor eyesight, it is harder for them to search for food and avoid predators in the dark. = T. i. brevetianus variation = A small number of melanistic (all-black) Malayan tapirs have been observed. In 1924, an all-black tapir was sent to Rotterdam Zoo and was classified as a subspecies called Tapirus indicus brevetianus after its discoverer, Captain K. Brevet.Shuker, Dr. Karl P. N. Mysteries of Planet Earth, pages 11-12 In 2000, two melanistic tapirs were observed during a study of tigers in the Jerangau Forest Reserve in Malaysia.Mohd, Azlan J. \\"Recent Observations of Melanistic Tapirs in Peninsular Malaysia\\" . Tapir Conservation: The Newsletter of the IUCN/SSC Tapir Specialist Group, June 2002, Volume 11, Number 1, pages 27-28 The cause of this variation may be a genetic abnormality similar to that of black panthers that appear in populations of spotted leopards or spotted jaguars. However, unless, and until, more T. i. brevetianus individuals can be studied, the precise explanation for the trait will remain unknown. Lifecycle A juvenile tapir, still with dappled markings, asleep The gestation period of the Malayan tapir is about 390‚Äì395 days, after which a single offspring, weighing around 15 pounds (6.8 kg), is born. Malayan tapirs are the largest of the four tapir species at birth and grow more quickly than their congeners.Fahey, B. 1999. \\"Tapirus indicus\\" (On-line), Animal Diversity Web. Retrieved June 16, 2006. Young tapirs of all species have brown hair with white stripes and spots, a pattern that enables them to hide effectively in the dappled light of the forest. This baby coat fades into adult coloration between four and seven months after birth. Weaning occurs between six and eight months of age, at which time the babies are nearly full-grown, and the animals reach sexual maturity around age three. Breeding typically occurs in April, May or June, and females generally produce one calf every two years. Malayan tapirs can live up to 30 years, both in the wild and in captivity. Behaviour Malayan tapirs are primarily solitary creatures, marking out large tracts of land as their territory, though these areas usually overlap with those of other individuals. Tapirs mark out their territories by spraying urine on plants, and they often follow distinct paths, which they have bulldozed through the undergrowth. A Malayan tapir walking in middle of night at Taman Negara National Park, Pahang, Malaysia Exclusively herbivorous, the animal forages for the tender shoots and leaves of more than 115 species of plants (around 30 are particularly preferred), moving slowly through the forest and pausing often to eat and note the scents left behind by other tapirs in the area. However, when threatened or frightened, the tapir can run quickly, despite its considerable bulk, and can also defend itself with its strong jaws and sharp teeth. Malayan tapirs communicate with high-pitched squeaks and whistles. They usually prefer to live near water and often bathe and swim, and they are also able to climb steep slopes. Tapirs are mainly active at night, though they are not exclusively nocturnal. They tend to eat soon after sunset or before sunrise, and they will often nap in the middle of the night. This behavior characterizes them as crepuscular animals. Habitat, predation, and vulnerability Map of Malayan tapir distribution in the wild, data circa 2003 The Malayan tapir was once found throughout the tropical lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, and Vietnam. However, its numbers have decreased in recent years, and today, like all tapirs, it is in danger of extinction. Because of their size, tapirs have few natural predators, and even reports of killings by tigers are scarce.bin Momin Khan, Mohd Khan. \\"Status and Action Plan of the Malayan Tapir (Tapirus indicus)\\" Tapirs: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan published by IUCN Tapir Specialist Group, 1997, page 2 The main threat to the Malayan tapirs is human activity, including deforestation for agricultural purposes, flooding caused by the damming of rivers for hydroelectric projects, and illegal trade.Fact sheet on Malayan Tapir - Tapirus indicus , UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre, in association with the World Wildlife Foundation In Thailand, for instance, capture and sale of a young tapir may be worth US$5500.00. In areas such as Sumatra, where the population is predominantly Muslim, tapirs are seldom hunted for food, as their physical similarity to pigs has made tapir meat a taboo, but in some regions they are hunted for sport or shot accidentally when mistaken for other animals.Simon, Tamar. \\"The Tapir: A Big Unknown\\" article from Discovery Channel Canadian website , July 22, 1999. Protected status in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, which seeks to curb deliberate killing of tapirs but does not address the issue of habitat loss, has had limited effect in reviving or maintaining the population.
