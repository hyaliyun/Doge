Compost heaters are used primarily for demonstration purposes as small systems for heating a house. Local waste can be converted to energy. Types Using the heat of an external compost heap for warming up the inside of a house =Compost heap= The traditional compost heater exploits the heat of a large compost heap to warm a house. This type requires a big heap, intertwined with a spiral water hose. The circulating water conducts heat to the building, where it can be fed to a heating circuit. The heap must contain at least 8,000 liters of biomass to maintain a temperature during the winter. For this purpose, chipped wood is usually piled up and a water hose is passed through it. A microbiological degradation process generates heat for up to 24 months. The heat produces hot water, which is then fed to a heating circuit. With sufficient oxygen supply, the biomass is degraded by aerobic decomposition. The activity of the microorganisms can be regulated by the moisture content. =Hot water and biogas= The heat of a compost heap is used, and biogas is produced at the same time. Pain's 'Biomeiler' combines composting with biogas. The raw materials of Pain's compost heap were saplings, branches and underbrush. He developed the machines that grind these materials to the proper size. One of his machines, a tractor-driven model, earned fourth prize in the 1978 Grenoble Agricultural Fair.Another Kind of Energy or ComPost-Modernism - By Peter Bane. After Pain had ground the raw materials, Pain would construct a heap three metres high and six metres across (10 √ó 20 feet). The heap weighed approximately , and was mounted over a steel tank. This tank was 3/4 full of compost, which had first been steeped in water for two months. The hermetically sealed tank was connected by tubing to 24 truck tire inner tubes, gathered nearby to collect the methane gas. The gas was distilled by washing and compressing it through small stones in water. Pain used the gas for cooking and producing electricity. He also fueled a light van. Pain estimated that of brushwood would supply the gas equivalent of . of petrol. It took about 90 days to produce of gas - enough to keep two ovens and three burner stoves going for a year. The methane-fueled combustion engine drove a generator that produced 100 watts of electricity. This charged a battery, providing the light needed. Skepticism has been leveled at Pain's estimates for methane extractionTalk page on the Appropedia project: Jean Pain System and it is not known if anyone has been able to reproduce his results. Pain's compost heaps generated hot water via of pipe buried inside the compost mound. The pipe was wrapped around the methane generator with an inlet for cold water and an outlet for hot water. The heat from the decomposing mass produced of hot water heated to ‚Äî enough to meet central heating, bathroom and kitchen requirements. The heap composted for nearly 18 months, after which it was dismantled. The humus was used to mulch soils. =Heater silo= Using the heat of a compost heater silo for warming up the inside of a house The composting process runs in an airtight container inside a house. The heat can be radiated directly to the interiors of the house or distributed by a heating circuit. An additional water pipe can be vertically built into the silo for warming water. The silo is the central part of an in-house compost heater. In autumn the silo is filled up with fresh biomass, after which the silo delivers comfortable heat throughout the winter.The Compost Heater Silo project Inlet air and outlet air provide the necessary oxygen. The outlet air goes out of the house. Silo moisture is higher than in a regular compost heap. The decay process produces additional water, which is drained at the bottom of the silo. A part of this water enters the top of the silo for better distribution in the processing volume. If pumped periodically or continuously to the top to rinse through the silo, the whole system becomes a wet composting system.

This interest has become increasingly apparent in popular culture.  Background and history  The history of male grooming dates back to ancient Egyptian civilization. Scholars consider the discovery of copper razors and the practice of putting oil on the skin as the origins of \\"grooming\\". The growth of women's rights movements is a reason for the recent growth of interest in male grooming. As women entered the workforce, men increasingly paid attention to their own appearance and investing in \\"body capital\\". Trends Research Institute's publication \\"Interfashion Planning\\" states that, \\"Men's enthusiasm for good looks is not a sudden trend. It is because the importance of human relations in the rat race to modern men living in uncertain times is increasing.\\" Appearance is treated as an investment in differentiating oneself from one's competitors and as a path to self- development.\\" These fashion-conscious men are sometimes known as metrosexuals. = Korea = South Korea has become a center of cosmetics use by men due to \\"appearance competition\\", where men wear makeup to compete in tight job markets. The Korean Wave cultural phenomenon, which includes K-pop, has also strongly influenced male grooming. As pop idols in their 20s and so-called \\"flower boys\\" have grown in popularity, the perception of men's makeup has changed. While it was once common for men who wore makeup to be associated with drag queens or homosexuality in western cultures, Korean male idols, although they are boyish in appearance, otherwise project masculinity. Men are encouraged to copy the makeup of Korean male idols. In fashion and beauty magazines overseas, there are many articles on skin care and makeup tutorials inspired by Korean pop stars. = China = The \\"woman-like man\\" has become a new trend in China, where a growing number of young men are interested in makeup. The number of internet broadcasters and beauty bloggers who produce makeup videos for men has increased rapidly. Accordingly, the men's cosmetics industry has grown rapidly in China. According to German market-research firm Statista, the size of the men's cosmetics industry in China reached 201.3 billion yuan as of May 2018. Chinese e-commerce company JD.com said that the sales of beauty products for men has more than doubled since 2015. Mask packs, BB cream, and lipstick are popular products. = United States = Men's grooming has grown substantially in the US and is projected to grow over the next decade. According to Statista, by 2024 the global male grooming market is estimated to be worth about 81.2 billion U.S. dollars.  Types of grooming  = Cosmetics = Male Cosmetics in drug store Men's cosmetics products‚Äîtoners, fragrances, and lotions‚Äîhave gained a foothold in the mainstream market. In addition, cosmetics that can be used by either men or women have become popular. The Korean men's cosmetics market has steadily grown from 733 billion won, in 2010, to 1.23 trillion won, in 2016, and to 1.28 trillion won, in 2018. About 75% of Korean men use cosmetics more than once a week, according to global data from overseas market research institutions, which indicates that the percentage of men who use cosmetics in Korea is higher than that of other countries. According to a recent survey by Mintel, a global market research firm, 70% of 1,000 American men use sunscreen, and 67% of men use cosmetics for their facial skin.  Skin care  Even though men are increasingly taking care of their appearance, it is not easy to find information about men's cosmetics. Therefore, men often use relatively more available female cosmetics. However, men's skin being fundamentally different from women's, the use of female products can damage a man's skin. An oily face is considered one of the three biggest problems for men in their 20s to 40s. Thus, they are encouraged to use toner and lotion for oily skin types. BB cream  BB cream is used to heighten skin tone. Men's BB cream is characterized by its delicate and natural persistence. This covers skin defects, but does not look like one is wearing makeup. Eyebrows Interest in eyebrow trimming and eyebrow makeup has also increased. Eyebrows have become a major concern for job seekers. Sales of eyebrow beauty tools have increased in the last few years.  Lip balm Lip balm is a beauty item that is easily available to men who don't wear makeup. Colored lip balm is popular because it is used not only for moisturizing but also to help with one's skin tone. Colored lip balm is suitable for men who prefer a natural look because it can brighten one's lips with color that compliments their natural skin tone, but more subtly than lipstick or tint. = Hair = Barber shops are also one of the places that can assist modern grooming men. Barbers are licensed professionals who are trained to cut, shave, and style hair. Male grooming products‚Äîincluding pomades, shave products, powder, beard oil, and shampoo and conditioners‚Äîcan be purchased at barbershop. While most men in Korea are looking for women- oriented beauty salons, the U.S.-style barber shop has drawn in male customers as well. = Cosmetic surgery = Men are willing to go to the operating room to make a favorable impression.  Botox  Men with small wrinkles on their faces, such as around the eyes and mouth, are seeking Botox treatments, such as what women get. Middle-aged men get Botox surgery for skin regeneration and wrinkle removal in the hope of securing a new job.  Eyebrow tattoo  The eyebrows play a big role in facial expression to the extent that they are called \\"the roof of the face\\". Over 100,000 years, the role of eyebrows has become more important as the size of human faces has become smaller and the facial lines have become smoother. Dark eyebrows on a small face make other people more aware of facial expressions. Recently, there has been a trend of men tattooing their eyebrows. The process of a permanent eyebrow tattoo involves designing the eyebrows and filling with pigment.  Contouring injection surgery  Male contouring injection surgery removes fat from the face and creates clearly defined facial features.  Waxing/Laser procedure  Men are having laser treatments for permanent removal of facial and body hair.  Influence in society  = Increasing importance of personal appearance = When asked: \\"What do you think are the criteria for a nice man?\\", in a survey conducted by the Korea National Statistical Office, \\"look and fashion\\" accounted for 22.7%, followed by character, economy, and values. When asked, \\"What do you think of a well- dressed man?\\", 37.2% thought \\"cool\\" and 30.1% said, \\"I want to try\\". In addition, there is the phenomenon of men valuing appearance over ability. People are undergoing cosmetic surgery to make favorable impressions during interviews. As a result of the perception that a change in facial shape improves first impressions, facial contouring surgery is becoming popular across industries. = Corporate strategy = There has been a growth in corporate gifting to align with the demand for men's grooming products. Men with sharp features are finding opportunities in conventional advertising. Both men and women have changed their perception of men looking after their appearance in relation to being competitive in the job market and in marrying.

The goal is to improve modeling and simulation of the biological system to attain a better understanding of the nature's critical structural features, such as a wing, for use in future bioinspired designs. Bioinspiration differs from biomimicry in that the latter aims to precisely replicate the designs of biological materials. Bioinspired research is a return to the classical origins of science: it is a field based on observing the remarkable functions that characterize living organisms, and trying to abstract and imitate those functions.  History  Ideas in science and technology often arise from studying nature. In the 16th and 17th century, G. Galilei, J. Kepler and I. Newton studied the motion of the sun and the planets and developed the first empirical equation to describe gravity. A few years later, M. Faraday and J. C. Maxwell derived the fundamentals of electromagnetism by examining interactions between electrical currents and magnets. The studies of heat transfer and mechanical work lead to the understanding of thermodynamics. However, quantum mechanics originated from the spectroscopic study of light. Current objects of attention are originated in chemistry but the most abundant of them are found in biology, e.g. the study of genetics, characteristics of cells and the development of higher animals and disease. =The current field of research= Bio-inspiration is a solidly established strategy in the field of chemistry, but it is not a mainstream approach. Especially, this research is still developing its scientific and technological systems, on academic and industrial levels. This field dates back from the 1980s but in the 2010s, many natural phenomena have not been studied., Typical characteristics of bioinspiration =Function= Bio-inspired research is quite different from chemistry research. This research does not focus on complexity and microscopic things like molecular structure. It is based on observing and understanding the functions from the products of biological evolution. =A limitless source of ideas= There are various kinds of organisms and many different strategies that have proved successful in biology at solving some functional problem. Some kinds of high-level bio functions may seem simple, but they are supported by many layers of underlying structures, processes, molecules and their elaborate interaction. There is no chance to run out of phenomena for bio- inspired research. =Simplicity= Often, bio-inspired research about something can be much easier than precisely replicating the source of inspiration. For example, researchers do not have to know how a bird flies to make an airplane. =Transcultural field= Bio-inspiration returns to observation of nature as a source of inspiration for problem-solving and make it part of a grand tradition. The simplicity of many solutions emerge from a bio-inspired strategy, combined with the fact that different geographical and cultural regions have different types of contact with animals, fish, plants, birds and even microorganisms. This means different regions will have intrinsic advantages in areas in which their natural landscape is rich. So bio-inspired research is trans-cultural field.  Technical applications  There are many technical applications available nowadays that are bioinspired. However, this term should not be mixed up with biomimicry. For example, an airplane in general is bioinspired by birds. The wing tips of an airplane are biomimetic because its original function of minimizing turbulence and therefore needing less energy to fly, is not changed or improved compared to nature's original. Also, Nano 3D printing method is also one of the novel method for bioinspiration. Plants and animals have particular properties which are often related to their composition of nano- and micro surface structures. Many research have already been tried to mimic Salvinia molesta leaves for superhydrophobicity, gecko's toes which increase the amount of attractive Van der Waals force that lead to adhesiveness even on slippery surfaces, and moth antennae which inspire a new approach to detect chemical leaks, drugs and explosives.

Joseph attended the Ridley School of Art and the Royal College of Art in London. She painted portraits, interiors and urban landscapes in a style clearly influenced by Impressionism but often with a limited palette. Joseph was also an activist in both the women's suffrage movement and in support of Jewish charities. She was among the founders of the Ladies' Guild at the Hammersmith Synagogue in west London and also ran reading rooms in the Whitechapel area. After meeting Isaac Rosenberg in 1911, she helped pay for his studies at the Slade School of Art. Joseph was arrested at least once during the women's suffrage campaign. When her 1912 exhibition at the Baille Gallery, Some London and Country Interiors, was reviewed in the Jewish Chronicle a notice appeared on the same page apologising for her absence from the show's Private View reception on the grounds that \\"she was detained at Holloway Goal in connection with the Women's Suffrage Movement\\". In 1924, Joseph and her architect husband held a joint exhibition of drawings and paintings at the Suffolk Street Galleries. Throughout her life Joseph was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy, showing some twenty-five paintings between 1904 and 1938. She also exhibited with the Society of Women Artists, the New English Art Club and the Royal Society of British Artists. Joseph exhibited at the Paris Salon receiving an Honourable Mention on one occasion and in 1929 winning a silver medal. In 1946 the Ben Uri Gallery in London had a joint exhibition of works by Joseph and her brother Solomom and examples of her paintings were included in the Jewish Art of Great Britain 1845‚Äì1945 exhibition held at the Belgrave Gallery in 1978.

Ipsens Enke was a ceramics manufacturer based at Frederikssundsvej 78 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The company was founded by Peter Ipsen in 1843 and was continued by his widow Louise Ipsen and son Berthel Ipsen after his death in 1860. It achieved international success with its replica of antique Greek and Roman ceramics, winning awards at international expositions and opening its own shops in Paris and London. After the turn of the century, it collaborated with artists such as Thorvald Bindesb√∏ll, WillumsenJ and Axel Salto. It closed in 1955. History =Early history (1843‚Äì1860)= Peter Ipsen (1815-1860) initially apprenticed as a joiner in his home town but gave it up as a result of poor health to become an apprentice at the Royal Porcelain Manufactury in 1833. His sharp eye for shape made him a favourite of Gustav Friedrich Hetsch. He remained at the Royal Porcelain Manufactury after completing his apprenticeship six years later. [The factory in Utterslev] Ipsen established his own pottery on 15 April 1843 in N√∏rrebro. His products included flower pots, lamps, water coolers and tea sets as well as replica of antique Greek vases and vessels. He had no oven and therefore had to burn his output at the Royal Porcelain Manufactury. Ipsen initially experienced some difficulty selling his yellow, unglazed creations to the city's many porcelain vendors but demand slowly increased and by 1847 he was able to buy a small piece of land and build a new workshop at Frederikssundsvej in Utterslev. He opened a ceramics shop at Bredgade 31 the following year. In 1852, he was represented on an exhibition at Christiansborg Riding Grounds. He had maintained his He had close ties to Hetsch and Henrik Olrik. =International success under Louise and Berthel Ipsen (1860‚Äì1900)= [Louise Ipsen] [Advertisement for the company] [P. Ipsens Enke products in a catalogue from 1886] Ipsen died in 1860. His widow continued the company with Hermann Bonfils as manager. Peter and Louise Ipsen's son, Bertel Ipsen (1846-1917), became an apprentice under Bonfils om 1861. He became the formal manager of the company when Bonfils was drafted in 1865 but his mother continued to play a central role in the operations. The company was represented on the Nordic exhibitions in Malm√∂ in 1861 and Stockholm in 1866 and at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1756 and The Great Exhibition in London in 1870. In 1871, P. Ipsens Enke was granted the predicate Purveyor to the Court of Denmark. The company won a fold medal at a competition in Amsterdam in 1877. =20th century= P. Ipsens Enke was converted into a family-owned limited company (aktieselskab) in 1895. The company began a production of glazed stoneware with more modern designs in circa 1900. It collaborated with artists and designers such as Thorvald Bindesb√∏ll, Christian Joachim Jensen, Georg Jensen and Axel Salto. Stender, a publishing house, acquired the company after Berthel Ipsen's death in 1917. The company acquired Dalbyg√•rd Clay Pits on Bornholm in 1920. It closed in 1955. Works Works from P.

It follows main characters Eden, a veteran of the Iraq War who waits to die in a San Antonio burn center from severe injuries suffered in the conflict, and his wife Mary. She cares for their daughter and struggles with the decision of whether to take husband Eden off life support. The story is narrated by Eden's best friend, killed in the same explosion that badly injured Eden. It revolves around themes of intimacy and grief, and received a generally warm reception. Plot While on his second tour in Iraq, US Marine Corporal Eden is caught in the blast from an improvised explosive device while on patrol with his fellow Marine and best friend in their humvee. The blast kills everyone in the vehicle other than Eden, including the book's omniscient narrator. Eden suffers severe burns over the entirety of his body. Eden is transported back to the US for treatment, where he is confined to a hospital bed and suffers constant severe pain. Unable to communicate, he is \\"not alive, not dead, what it was didn‚Äôt have a name.\\" In the hospital, his wife Mary cares for Eden, and advocates his medical care. She \\"never leaves him,\\" and \\"soon Eden became like an appendage to her, one she spoke for ... His body became her own, and she anchored to it. Even as she refused to leave, she wanted him to die.\\" Among these challenges, she watches their daughter take her first steps among the sterile corridors of the military hospital. She struggles with the ultimate decision of whether to take Eden, \\"immobilized and practically catatonic\\", off the life support that tethers him to the world. From the vantage of the novel's narrator, the story explores Eden's inner consciousness. He has a stroke after Mary leaves for the Christmas holiday and his mind becomes \\"unlocked\\". The novel explores the history of the couple, including with the narrator; Eden's decision to reenlist in the military, and the experiences of Mary with the \\"war on terror as it‚Äôs waged at home\\". She is pregnant with the couple's child when Eden prepares to mobilize for his second time. Themes In describing the themes of the novel, Ackerman told NPR that although war sets the backdrop for the characters, the narrative is centrally one of intimacy: > ...and it's also about grief ‚Äî which I think is a type of faith, because > contained within grief is this assumption that if we make it through it, > that there will be healing on the other end. I'm not sure that that healing > always occurs, and when it doesn't occur, oftentimes we're left just waiting > in this type of liminal state ‚Äî hence the title of the book. Ackerman reflected that the choice of the name Mary was intentional, and an allusion to the biblical character, saying \\"I know lots of Marys, and I think we probably all do.\\" As quoted in Vogue, Ackerman described his work' foundation as grounded in \\"the cumulative loss of many friends and the larger questions of how we keep faith with each other.\\" Reception The Boston Globe described the novel as a \\"tight-knit, inward-looking reckoning with the costs of military sacrifice ‚Äî in emphatic flesh-and-blood terms.\\" In their list of anticipated books for the Fall of 2018, critic Ron Charles in The Washington Post praised Ackerman's prowess as \\"one of the best soldier-writers of his generation\\". Joshua Finnell in the Library Journal described Waiting for Eden as \\"a profound meditation on the liminal space between our past, present, and future,\\" and Alexander Moran of Booklist praised the work as \\"a deeply moving portrayal of how grief can begin even while our loved ones still cling to life.\\" In her review of essential books for the 2018 Fall season, Chloe Schama in Vogue described Waiting for Eden as \\"an unflinching guide to the mental, physical, and familial toll of war.\\" See also * Green on Blue, a 2015 novel also by Ackerman Notes References External links * Elliot Ackerman official website * Category:2018 American novels Category:Novels about death Category:Novels about marriage Category:Novels about war and conflict Category:Alfred A.

Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Assembly of the Republic. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The Prime Minister must control a majority of parliament in order to govern. The office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not a permanent position, existing only at the discretion of the Prime Minister. Unlike analogous offices in some other nations, such as a vice-presidency, the Deputy Prime Minister possesses no special constitutional powers under the Constitution of Northern Cyprus as such, though they will always have particular responsibilities in government. They do not assume the duties and powers of the Prime Minister in the latter's absence, illness, or death. The Deputy Prime Minister does not automatically succeed the Prime Minister when the latter is incapacitated, or resigns from the leadership of his or her party. The designation of someone to the role of Deputy Prime Minister may provide additional practical status within the cabinet, enabling exercise of de facto, if not de jure, power. In a coalition government, such as the √ñzg√ºrg√ºn cabinet between the National Unity Party and Democratic Party, the appointment of the leader of the smaller party (in this case, Serdar Denkta≈ü, leader of the Democratic Party) as Deputy Prime Minister is done to give that person more authority within the cabinet to enforce the coalition's agreed-upon agenda. The Deputy Prime Minister usually deputises for the Prime Minister at official functions. The current Erh√ºrman cabinet has Kudret √ñzersay as the Deputy Prime Minister, receiving the seniority as the leader of the second biggest party (People's Party) of the 4-party coalition. History Following the events in 1974, an executive committee was formed to govern Northern Cyprus on August 26, 1974. This committee later established the Autonomous Turkish Cypriot Administration. Rauf Denkta≈ü was both serving as the head of state and the head of government of ATCA. Osman √ñrek served as the Vice President and the Minister of Defence of ATCA, becoming the first deputy leader of the government. The position of Vice Presidency was abolished after the establishment of Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, since it was a semi-presidential republic. Following the establishment of TFSC, Vedat √áelik was appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence and Foreign Affairs of the first cabinet. However after the cabinet changes on July 7, 1977 the office of the Deputy Prime Minister of the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus was abolished. The first Deputy Prime Minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was √ñzker √ñzg√ºr who served at the First and Second Atun cabinets as the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of State. The position of the Deputy Prime Minister was abolished by the formation of the Eighth Eroƒülu Cabinet and reinstalled by the formation of the Yorgancƒ±oƒülu cabinet and used by the all following governments with the exception of Kalyoncu cabinet.

A 700-1400 base pair segment of DNA was found to have inserted itself into the gal and lac operons resulting in a strong polar mutation. This mechanism was then found to have the ability to insert other short genetic sequences into other locations within the bacterial genome often leading to a change in the expression of neighboring genes. Oftentimes it leads to the neighboring genes to simply shut off. However some of these segments also had strong start and stop signals which changed the regulation of neighboring genes leading in changes in the amount of transcription. What differentiated this form of genetic recombination from those dependent of genetic homology was that the process observed as illegitimate did not require the use of homologous segments of DNA. While not being entirely understood at the time, it was recognized to hold potential in generating changes in the chromosomal evolution.  Mechanism  = In prokaryotes = In prokaryotes, illegitimate recombination results in a mutation of the genetic sequence of the prokaryote. This process takes different forms in eukaryotes one of which is deletions. In a deletion mutation the prokaryotic organism undergoes illegitimate recombination resulting in the removal of a continuous segment of genetic code. However this form of mutation occurs infrequently among mutants of natural origin rather than those that have been induced. Illegitimate recombination can also occur due to the transduction of genetic material from a bacteriophage. In this case a bacteriophage will insert its genetic material into a bacteria in order to have it inserted into the bacterial genome at a point regardless of genetic homology. Another form of illegitimate recombination in prokaryotes is that of a duplication mutations of a genome. In this case a portion of the parental genome is inserted multiple times into the genome. This duplication either inserts the genetic material in the same orientation or opposite of the original parental segments as it is non- homology driven. = In eukaryotes = The mechanism of Illegitimate recombination is that of non-homologous end joining in which two strands of DNA not sharing homology will be joined together by the gene repair machinery. Upon recognition of a double strand break a protein complex will keep the two strands within close enough proximity in order to allow for repair of the strands. Next the ends of the DNA are repaired such that any incorrect or damaged nucleotides are removed. Once this happens the strands are able to be ligated together such that they are a single strand of DNA which previously had not been adjacent. This process is common for eukaryotic cells and tends to act as a repair mechanism, but can lead to these mutations if illegitimate recombination occurs. The illegitimate recombination will often take the form of large chromosomal aberrations within a eukaryotic organism as it has much larger segments of DNA than prokaryotic cells. As of such non-homologous end joining can cause illegitimate recombination which creates insertion and deletion mutations in chromosomes as well as translocation of one chromosomal segment to that of another chromosome. These large scale changes in the chromosome in eukaryotic organisms tend to have deleterious effects on the organism rather than conferring a type of genetic advantage.  Deleterious effects on organisms  Illegitimate recombination oftentimes has deleterious effects on an organism as it results in a large scale change on the genetic sequence of an organism. These changes will result in mutations as the joining of DNA not based on homology will most often place genetic elements in locations in which they previously had not been placed. This can disrupt the function of genes which may be essential to the function of an organism. In the case of cancer it has been found that tumors can be a result of illegitimate recombination resulting in hairpin formation which alters the gene function within the genome of tumor cells.  Applications  Illegitimate recombination is a tool which can be used in the laboratory as well as it is a useful research tool. Illegitimate recombination can generate random mutagenesis in order to generate a random alteration of the genetic sequence of an organism. The induction of this mutagenesis allows for the study of a genetic sequence by creating a mutation in a genetic segment altering the function of that genetic segment. This allows for the study of gene function through the analysis of differences between mutants and natural organisms to interpret what process a gene is linked to.

Biography Elvire de Bruijn was born in 1914 in Erembodegem, East Flanders, Belgium. He was officially inscribed as the daughter of his parents, and raised as a girl, but he soon was considerably taller and stronger than other girls his age, and by the age of 14 he realised that he was not like other girls. This deeply upset and troubled him, even contemplating suicide. From 1928 on, after he had finished his schooling, he started working in a cigarette company, but a few months later he began working in his parents' caf√©. In the evenings, he secretly began reading about his condition, not only in medical literature by e.g. Magnus Hirschfeld, but also in mythological and anthropological studies. Eventually he became convinced that he was a hermaphrodite. He started cycling in 1932. In 1933, he won the women's European Championship in Aalst, Belgium. In 1934 he won the Belgian Championship in Leuven, and the World Championships in Schaarbeek, in front of an estimated 100,000 viewers. He was by then the biggest Belgian star in women's cycling. But he felt more and more uncomfortable racing and winning against women, when he had \\"felt like a man, never like a woman\\". He continued racing to earn money, but deliberately finished second or third instead of winning. He learned about Zdenƒõk Koubek, a Czech athlete who after being a champion woman athlete had become a man. By 1936, he dropped his previous female name Elvire and started living as a man named Willy. But as he officially was still registered as a woman named Elvire, he repeatedly came into trouble and lost jobs which were not considered acceptable for women, like working in a hotel kitchen. By 1937, after being operated in Paris, he had officially become Willy de Bruijn, and his story is told in 4 articles titled \\"How I became a Man\\" in the newspaper De Dag in April 1937. He continued cycling, but without much success. He opened a pub in Brussels, \\"Caf√© Denderleeuw\\", where he presented himself as \\"Willy ex Elvira de Bruyn\\" and \\"Elvira de Bruyn, world champion cycling for women, became a man in 1937\\". In 1965, Willy de Bruijn was selling \\"smoutebollen\\" at the Belgian village at the New York World's Fair. He died in 1989 in Antwerp. A street was named after him in Brussels in July 2019 .

He was the founder of Abbey Dawn ‚Äì a bird sanctuary, museum, art gallery, and poet's retreat ‚Äì located approximately five miles east of Kingston, Ontario.  Early life  Robb was born on May 19, 1888 to Montreal-born parents William Doig Robb and Catharine Haggart Black. His father was an official at the Grand Trunk Railway. Robb was the third of six children his family lived near the Grand Trunk Railway Station called the Belleville Junction on Station Street in Belleville, Ontario. In 1894, the family moved to a more upscale neighbourhood at 60 Alexander Street. In 1897, the Robb family moved to Toronto to follow William's advancing career. Here, Robb attended Lansdowne Public School, and wrote his first poem at age 10. The Robb family returned to Belleville in 1900, where Robb attended Belleville High School. Robb hid his appreciation for poetry from friends ‚Äì he was active in debating, hockey, and football instead. Robb also developed an interest in birds, and established a private bird sanctuary in the gardens at the back of his Alexander Street home.Photograph of members of the Robb and Burrows families at their wedding on June 4, 1913.  Career  From 1906 to 1921, Robb was a salesman in Montreal. He started at the Canada Bronze Company and later joined the Canadian agency for the Anchor Packaging Company with four of his brothers in 1909. On June 4, 1913, Robb married Edna Ilene Burrows of Belleville. A year later, Robb served in the Great War as a Lieutenant in the Canadian Expeditionary Force from September 22 to December 31, 1914. Robb returned to Montreal where he and his wife had one daughter and two sons. In 1921, Robb retired from sales and joined a photographic expedition in the Magdalen Islands to photograph sea birds. When he returned to Montreal, he joined the Province of Quebec Society for the Protection of Birds. His involvement with the society resulted in his joining American Audubon Society field man Herbert K. Job in a successful photography trips to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. These trips inspired Robb to pursue poetry and writing, and despite protests from family he sold his business interests to his brothers and moved to the United States with his wife and children. While there he did free-lance work in Portland, Maine and then moved to Cazenovia, New York where he remained until 1924. = Edward VIII's Patronage = Robb returned to Canada in 1924 when Edward VIII, then Prince of Wales, expressed interest in his Robb's inspirations. He first heard about Robb's photographic work traveling on one of William Doig Robb's trains. Edward persuaded Robb to return to Ontario to focus on writing as he thought Canada in need of good poets. When Robb agreed he became the first poet to be honoured with the Prince of Wales as a patron. This relationship had not been established since the Middle Ages, and would last for 11 years. = Abbey Dawn = Robb returned to Belleville in 1924 and initiated 'Abbey Dawn,' a bird sanctuary located outside Belleville. Robb had been gifted one dozen wild geese from Bellevillian bird keeper Jack Miner, and found they had been shot to death one morning in 1928. Robb took his anger to Belleville's City Hall who had refused to recognize Robb's location as an official bird sanctuary. While there he flung a bag of the dead geese on the mayor's desk and later published a long and violent poem about Belleville, in which he damned the city and all its citizens. An image of a painting in the Wallace Havelock Robb collection of paintings of Canadian birds by Allan Brooks. After this incident, Robb relocated Abbey Dawn to a plot of land approximately five miles east of Kingston, Ontario. The land, first described as a 500-acre plateau of woodland, initially served as Robb's family's home farm where they managed 84 head of cattle and crops. Over time, the land developed into a retreat and study centre for visiting poets as well as a bird sanctuary and a museum of interesting Indigenous artifacts Robb had found in the area. Visitors paid a $.50 admission fee to see the artifacts, birds, art, and listen to Robb present his poetry. One of the artists he featured in his gallery was Allan Brooks, whom Robb shared a good friendship and business relationship. The site was also the first bird sanctuary for birds of prey in North America. Robb published his written work from the location, via Abbey Dawn Press, and the area eventually gained official recognition by the Government of Ontario as the Abbey Dawn Crown Game Reserve. The official description of the game reserve is below: Robb giving a poetry reading, 1925. _\\"In the Township of Pittsburgh in the County of Frontenac, being composed of parts of lots 5, 6, and 7, in Concession I, having an area of 500 acres, more or less, and described as follows: Commencing at the north- easterly angle of Lot 7; thence southerly along the easterly boundary of that lot a distance of 94 chains, more or less, to its intersection with the northerly limit of the right-of-way of that part of the King's Highway known as number 2; thence south 52¬∞58' west along that northerly limit a distance of 27 chains and 50 links, more or less, to the high-water mark on the northerly bank of a creek flowing through lots 5 and 6; thence westerly along that high- water mark a distance of 12 chains, more or less, to its intersection with the limit between the east and west halves of that lot 5; thence northerly along that limit a distance of 88 chains, more or less, to the northerly limit of that lot; thence easterly along the northerly limits of lots 5, 6, and 7, a distance of 48 chains and 50 links, more or less, to the place of commencement.\\"_ Abbey Dawn closed to the public in 1962 due to vandalism. Robb and his family continued to live there until his death in 1976.  Gitchi Nagamo  Gitchi Nagamo is the name of a bell Robb had cast for Abbey Dawn. Gitchi Nagamo is an Algonquin word meaning 'great sound,' which Robb further translated to 'a beautiful song.' The bell was cast in Crowden, England by Gillett and Johnston in 1936, and on the bell are the words cast from Robb's poem \\"Morningsong;\\" _I give my soul to the Silent Dawn, And it goes where the song of the birds has gone_ The bell was cast to Robb's specifications, and was mounted at Abbey Dawn. It was rung twice every day at dawn and dusk, at 4:30 daily for a pastoral and then again by visiting poets and pregnant women, and then again if they day were a holiday. It was also rung when a baby was baptized at the site. Robb conducted many baptisms at Abbey Dawn ‚Äì Robb claimed that poets were originally priests, and that long before Christianity, baptisms were name-giving ceremonies. Robb only baptized children of people who were not church-goers. Robb claimed this bell was a symbol of love and happiness, representative of 'the Bluebird of Happiness.' The bell was originally commissioned out of inspiration and respect for the 'first poet of North America,' who according to Robb is simply a 'redman'. = Work with Mohawk people = Close to Belleville is Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, a Mohawk reserve home to the Bay of Quinte Mohawks. Much of Robb's published work refers to a place called 'Kente,' which is the traditional name for the Bay of Quinte region (of which Belleville is a part). 'Quinte' is the current term for the area, having been morphed from the traditional Mohawk name. Robb and his wife lived with the Mohawks on this reservation for 3 1/2 years, learning the language and assisting with the preservation of the culture and its history. Robb has been identified for his efforts in preserving and celebrating Mohawk culture. Mohawks from Six Nations of the Grand River (near Brantford, Ontario) had gifted Robb the title of 'Honorary Pine Tree Chief,' and he held an honorary Mohawk name meaning 'Great White Eagle' as he was adopted as a brother of the Mohawks. Works of his that relate to Mohawk culture and lore include Thunderbird, Tecumtha, and Kayonakonte.  Death and legacy  Robb died January 29, 1976 at his home in Abbey Dawn. His obituary in the Kingston Whig-Standard described him as a \\"distinguished poet,\\" and a \\"poet-naturalist\\".' His obituary was also featured in The Globe and Mail on January 31, 1976 where he was remembered for his conservation work. His legacy remains as a vibrant Canadian poet. When performing his poems at events, he wore a 'wine-red-purple' gowned donned with native symbols on the arms. This gown was made and given to him by the woman's literacy club in Saint Catherine's. Robb had even received letters from Queen Elizabeth II congratulating him on his poetic work. The Queen had received a copy of 'Hail Canada!' after it was forwarded to her by the Governor General's residence in 1967. The letter of acknowledgement read 'Her Majesty was delighted to accept these poems. The Queen enjoyed reading them very much and thought they were a most appropriate commemoration of Canada's Centennial Year.' The Queen had also mailed Robb earlier in 1959, after Robb had written a poem about the royal yacht that the Queen was touring Canada in. The Queen had received a copy prior to her departure, and one week later Robb received a letter of thanks for the poem.  Published work  Wallace Havelock Robb published multiple collections of poetry about Canadian flora and fauna and Indigenous lore, including: *The Quill and Candle (1927) *The Door of Dawn (1937) *Indian Christmas Carol (1940) *Thunderbird (1949) *A Far Bell Calling (1949) *Indian lore of the Bay of Quinte (1952) *Tecumtha (1958) *Kayanokonte (1961) *Hail Canada!

It was held at the beginning of the GAA season. Twelve teams took part ‚Äì the nine Ulster county teams and three university teams, i.e. St Mary's University College, Belfast, Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University at Jordanstown (UUJ). The draw was made on 5 December 2018 with the fixtures confirmed following a meeting of Comhairle Uladh CCC later in the month. Donegal were the defending champions having defeated Tyrone in the 2018 decider. Tyrone were the 2019 champions beating Armagh in the final. Tyrone also won all five of their games. Competition format Group Stage The twelve teams are drawn into three sections of four teams, with each section containing three county teams and one university team. Each team plays the other teams in their section once, either home or away. Two points are awarded for a win and one for a draw. The points-ratio method (points for divided by points against) is used to determine the ranking of teams who are level on section points (as opposed to the more typical scoring differential). Knock-out Stage The winners of the three sections and the best of the runners-up in the three sections compete in the semi-finals with the two winners meeting in the final. Experimental rules On 24 November 2018 the GAA Central Council approved five experimental changes to the football playing rules which were amended slightly and trialled in the 2018‚Äì19 early season competitions organised by the four provincial councils (FBD League - Connacht, O'Byrne Cup - Leinster, McGrath Cup - Munster and McKenna Cup - Ulster). The rules trialled were ‚Äì # The maximum number of consecutive handpasses allowed is three. # A sideline free must be kicked forward except when it is inside the opposing team's 20 metre line. # An advanced mark (sometimes also referred to as an attacking mark, inside mark or offensive mark) may be taken where the ball is kicked in the area outside the opposing team's 45 metre line, travels more than 20 metres, and is caught cleanly without touching the ground in the area inside the opposing team's 45 metre line by an attacker or a defender. Up to fifteen seconds are allowed for the free resulting from the mark to be taken. # Ten minutes in a sin bin without replacement is imposed on a player who commits a black card offence. The offending player can re-enter the game or be substituted after the ten minutes have elapsed. # Kickouts must be taken from the 20 metre line but are not required to travel beyond the 45 metre line. The effectiveness of the new rules was reviewed by Central Council on 19 January 2019. Although one of the key aims of the experiment was to reduce the number of handpasses in gaelic football, they voted 25-23 to not continue with the rule that restricted the number of consecutive handpasses to three (which was previously trialled in the 1989 National Football League and quickly abandoned). This decision followed an almost universal campaign by GAA county team managers in the media against its permanent introduction The Gaelic Players Association (GPA) were also strongly against the three handpass rule. The remaining four experimental rules were trialled in the 2019 National Football League which began on 26 January 2019 and ended on 31 March 2019. There was little criticism of the four rules in the league games. Jim Gavin, the Dublin manager, said the decision to experiment in the league, the GAA's second tier inter-county competition, was \\"disrespectful\\". GAA rules only allow changes to the playing rules in years divisible by five which means that, at the earliest, the experimental playing rules could only be approved by Congress 2020 for implementation in the 2020 Championship. The three handpass rule was not used in the Dr. McKenna Cup final. Both Tyrone and Armagh agreed to play without the rule as it had been abandoned by Central Council in the hours just before the final.https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2019/0119/1024312-tyrone-battle- past-13-man-armagh-to-lift-mckenna-cup/ Group stage =Section A= =Section B= =Section C= =Ranking of section runners-up= Knock- out Stage =Semi-Finals= =Final= References Dr McKenna Cup Category:Dr McKenna Cup ","title":"2019 Dr McKenna Cup"},{"id":"58574296","text":"Majhawan is a constituency of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly covering the city of Majhawan in the Mirzapur district of Uttar Pradesh, India.

The institute is named after the Swiss entrepreneur Adolphe Merkle who created the foundation that partially funded the institute. History Dr. Adolphe Merkle, an entrepreneur from Fribourg, established the Adolphe Merkle Foundation in 2007 with the goal of strengthening research and teaching at the University of Fribourg. His contribution of 100 million Swiss francs constitutes one of the most important private donations to support academic research in Switzerland. In 2008, the Adolphe Merkle Institute was founded under its first director, Prof. Peter Schurtenberger, formerly a professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Fribourg and then appointed as the chair of Experimental Physics and Nanoscience at the Institute. He developed the vision of an interdisciplinary institute that focuses on soft nanomaterials and combines fundamental and application-oriented research. In 2010, Prof. Christoph Weder, who joined AMI as the chair for Polymer Chemistry and Materials in 2009, became director. The institute appointed Professors Alke Fink and Barbara Rothen-Rutishauser as co-chairs of BioNanomaterials and Michael Mayer as Professor of Biophysics. Prof. Schurtenberger left the institute to establish a new group at the University of Lund, and Ullrich Steiner was appointed as Professor of Soft Matter Physics. Since 2014, AMI is located on the University of Fribourg's P√©rolles campus. The Institute is housed in two renovated buildings that were previously a private clinic and an additional modern construction. Structure AMI is an interdisciplinary research center, focused on fundamental and application-oriented research in soft nano- and materials sciences. The institute is headed by an executive director and executive board, who report to a scientific advisory board and institute council. Administrative structures are said to be kept lean and AMI employs an industry liaison and technology transfer office for partners from industry and academia, dedicated personnel for EU project proposals and a communications officer. 50% of AMI staff are doctoral students and 20% postdoctoral researchers. The emphasis on interdisciplinarity is also reflected in how the research groups are constituted. They do not adhere to the traditional distinction of fields in the natural sciences but rather have interdisciplinary topics as their research focus. The principal investigators of the research groups have full professorships at the University of Fribourg's faculty of science. They teach at the Master's level but have a decreased teaching load in order to dedicate more time towards research activities at AMI. =Current Research Groups= *Polymer Chemistry & Materials (Prof. Christoph Weder) *BioNanomaterials (Prof. Alke Fink and Prof. Barbara Rothen-Rutishauser) *Biophysics (Prof. Michael Mayer) *Soft Matter Physics (Prof. Ullrich Steiner) =Former Research Groups= *Soft Nanoscience 2008-2010 (Prof. Peter Schurtenberger) *Nanoparticle Self-Assembly 2012-2017 (Prof. Marco Lattuada) *Macromolecular Chemistry 2013-2018 (Prof. Nico Bruns) Research Activities Conference talk at AMI AMI's research revolves around soft nanomaterials, such as such as nanoparticles, colloids, polymers, nanostructures, and nanopores, and emphasizes bio-inspired materials design, stimuli-responsive materials, optical materials, energy materials, sensing, the detection of nanoparticles in complex media, and the investigation of the interactions of nanomaterials with biological systems. The Polymer Chemistry & Materials group is conducting research on stimuli-responsive or smart polymers, supramolecular systems, bio-inspired materials, nanocomposites, and polymer mechanochemistry. The BioNanomaterials group's research focuses on bioprinting, hazard assessment of nanomaterials, nanoparticle analysis and nanobiomechanics. The BioPhysics group's research includes nanopores for single molecule analysis, bio-inspired voltage generation and pore forming peptides. The Soft Matter Physics group is investigating and manufacturing nanostructured materials made by polymer self-assembly, energy materials for solar cells and batteries, photonic and plasmonic effects arising from structured materials, bio-inspired materials and surfaces . In 2017 the institute had 33 active research projects. Topics of investigation include color-generation in insects, the effect of graphene on human lungs, bio- inspired drug delivery, record-breaking perovskite solar cells, and electric eel-inspired energy devices. Education For the master's students there is a strong early focus on 'hands-on' work in the AMI laboratories as well as the opportunity to join one of the research groups for their master's thesis. In 2015 AMI launched an interdisciplinary master's program at the interface of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology that emphasizes bio-inspired materials. A summer internship program for undergraduate students from universities in other European countries or The United States is also present and is run in collaboration with the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Bio- Inspired Materials of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF).

The Democrats lost vote share citywide and the Republicans gained one seat in City Council, but the Democratic acting mayor, James Hugh Joseph Tate, was elected to a full term and his party maintained their hold on the city government. The election was the first decline in the Democrats' share of the vote since they took control of the city government in the 1951 elections, and showed the growing tension between the reformers and ward bosses within their party. Background Since the 1951 election, Democrats in Philadelphia had held the mayor's office and a large majority of city council seats. Their victories in those years, which followed 67 years of Republican dominance, where achieved through a combination of reform-minded independents (including some former Republicans) and the Democratic organization led by Democratic City Committee chairman William J. Green, Jr. This coalition brought increasingly large victories to the Democratic Party throughout the 1950s. This pattern held through 1959 under reform mayors Joseph S. Clark Jr. and Richardson Dilworth, but by the early 1960s the coalition had begun to fray with reformers being increasingly marginalized. After Dilworth won reelection with 65% of the vote in 1959, grand jury investigations into City Hall corruption damaged the Democrats' chances in the 1961 election. The Democrats maintained power that year, but by smaller margins. Their reduced majorities and increased association with machine politics signaled the beginning of the end for the party's coalition with independent good government reformers. Dilworth's resignation in 1962 to run for governor made City Council President James Hugh Joseph Tate acting mayor. While Tate presented, in one author's words, \\"a rather neutral image in middle class wards,\\" he also was the first mayor since Bernard Samuel to have come up through the ranks of a political machine. The fading connection between the Democratic organization and good-government independents gave the Republicans their first hope for victory in years. Mayor James Tate had served as acting mayor since Dilworth's resignation on February 12, 1962. In 1963, he sought the Democratic nomination for election in his own right. Tate's attempt at a four-year term exposed a growing breach in the coalition of independent reformers and Democratic ward bosses that had cemented that party's grip on the electorate since 1951. The Democratic City Committee, led by Representative William J. Green Jr., endorsed Tate, but the opinion was not universal. Former mayor Clark, now a United States Senator, endorsed the primary challenge by a slate of Democratic candidates proposed by the Americans for Democratic Action, a left-leaning group of which he was a member. For mayor, the ADA and Clark pushed Walter M. Phillips, a former city representative and one of the architects of the Democrats' reform measures of the early 1950s. The contrast between Tate and Phillips was highlighted in the primary campaign. Tate, the self-made son of Irish-American factory workers, charged that Phillips saw government service as \\"a hobby\\" and claimed he was \\"too inexperienced and does not know enough to deal with the problems\\" of running a large city. Phillips in turn charged Tate with permitting corruption in city government, failing to improve schools, and driving out qualified city employees in favor of partisan patronage hires. In a low-turnout primary, the Democratic electorate sided with Tate, who tallied 128,840 votes to Phillips's 40,931 and perennial candidate H. Jerome Jaspan's 13,165. Tate's victory over Phillips, Clark later wrote, \\"marked the end of the 'independent' good- government influence in City Hall.\\" The Republican nomination was also easily won by the party organization's favored candidate, James T. McDermott. McDermott, who had lost a special election for city council in 1962, was a lawyer who had previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney. During the general election campaign, McDermott tried to take on the reform mantle, saying that Tate had worked to sabotage the good-government reforms of the Clark and Dilworth administrations. Tate, for his part, contrasted his experience with McDermott's and touted his endorsement by the AFL‚ÄìCIO. McDermott said that Tate \\"has never been off the public payroll in twenty-five years\\" and criticized the mayor's refusal to debate him. As the election neared, McDermott's attacks appeared to be working and political observers predicted a close race, possibly within 20,000 votes. While it was the closest race in years, the actual results were more solidly in favor of Tate, who won by nine percentage points. After a day of heavier-than-expected voter turnout, McDermott conceded that the mayor had won \\"fair and square.\\" Tate thanked labor leaders, ex-Mayor Dilworth, and chairman Green for their efforts, while extending a special thanks to President John F. Kennedy, who campaigned for Tate the previous week. Although the campaign focused on issues of corruption and bossism, race also played a role; local black leaders, including Cecil B. Moore, strongly supported Tate and claimed that McDermott had \\"written off the Negro vote.\\" City Council Philadelphians elected a seventeen-member city council in 1963, with ten members representing districts of the city, and the remaining seven being elected at-large. For the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates, and voters could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority party could only take five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. As in the mayor's race, a group of ADA-endorsed Democrats tried for nominations to City Council. In the at-large races, all five incumbents‚ÄîPaul D'Ortona, Leon Kolankiewicz, Walter S. Pytko, Marshall L. Shepard, and Mary Varallo‚Äîwere endorsed by the party's ward leaders, while liberals led by Clark pushed the candidacies of Lynwood F. Blount, Gordon Cavanaugh, Edmund B. Spaeth Jr., and Joy B. Takiff. Eight Democrats affiliated with neither of those factions also entered the race. The incumbents won easily, with vote totals ranging from 105,382 for Shepard to 71,852 for Pytko. The highest vote total for the insurgents was Takiff's 32,665. Incumbent Democrats in the 2nd, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 10th districts also fended off primary challenges easily. The Republicans nominated five for the at-large seats without opposition, including incumbents Thomas M. Foglietta and Virginia Knauer. After the primary, Sheriff William M. Lennox denounced the challengers, calling the ADA \\"utterly repugnant to the people of this great historic city\\" and saying that \\"this self-proclaimed reform group should answer the questions on its 'Red China' allegiance which it evaded throughout the campaign.\\" In the at-large seats during the general election, as in the mayor's race, the Democratic share of the vote decreased but they still reelected all five of their candidates. Republicans reelected incumbents Thomas Foglietta and Virginia Knauer to their two at-large seats. In the district races, there was more change. Republicans defeated incumbent Democrats in the two seats representing Northeast Philadelphia in races that The Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Joseph C. Goulden said turned on City Hall corruption and civil rights issues. The Democrats gained one seat back in the northwestern part of the city when Isadore H. Bellis narrowly defeated incumbent Stanley B. Smullen in a recently reconfigured 8th district. Democrats retained their hold on the remaining seven district seats, though with reduced majorities. Philadelphia city council districts after the 1963 election (Democrats in blue, Republicans in red.) Most votes for council at- large candidate by ward, 1963 City commissioners Philadelphia's City Hall In the race for city commissioners, each party nominated two candidates and the top three were elected. The office was a county office, a holdover from the time before consolidation of the townships in Philadelphia County into one city. The most important of the remaining duties of the commissioners in Philadelphia was the conduct of the city's elections; they also had responsibility for regulating weights and measures. Incumbent Democrats Thomas P. McHenry and Maurice S. Osser saw the same decline in their vote share as other Democrats did across the city, but held on to their seats on the city commission. Incumbent Republican Louis Menna edged out his running mate, Charles Wright, for the third seat. Two Socialist Labor Party candidates took a tiny share of the vote. Other offices and ballot measures Democrat William M. Lennox was reelected county sheriff, his fourth consecutive term. Louis Amarando, also a Democrat, was reelected clerk of the court of quarter sessions (a court whose jurisdiction was later transferred to the court of common pleas). The Democratic register of wills, John E. Walsh, Jr., also earned reelection. All three Democrats won their races by twelve or thirteen points, a decline from 1959, but still a safe majority. The Democrats also took nine of the fourteen magisterial district judge positions up for election that year (a local court, the duties of which have since been superseded by the Philadelphia Municipal Court) with incumbent Benjamin Segal leading the list. The ballot contained three questions authorizing more city borrowing: the first for $20.2 million to spend on land and buildings, the second for $16.9 million to spend on water and sewage systems, and the third for $5 million to spend on the Philadelphia Gas Works. All three passed by greater than two-to-one margins.

The site, now foundations and water power infrastructure remnants, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history The Maltby and Fowler families were prominent families in the 19th century history of the Northford village of North Branford. In 1830, Maltby Fowler, a scion of both families, opened a factory on the Farm River, which was engaged in the manufacture of buttons. In 1850, Fowler and his relatives Samuel and Julius Maltby began manufacturing tools and agricultural implements. E.C. Maltby, Julius' son, took over the business about 1860. He used coconut shells in the manufacture of ladles, and initially discarded the flesh of the nut. Kitchen experimentation produced a method for preserving the flesh by desiccation, with the result that dried shredded coconut also became a product of the factory. The Maltbys moved their business to Shelton in 1880. The plant was then taken over by David Stevens, who produced a popular series of Christmas cards that inaugurated their manufacture in Northford as one of its major industries.Gregan and Marx, p. 84 By the early 20th century, the factory was in decline. It was demolished about 1935, and the dam on the Farm River was washed away by flooding in 1971.

His scientific interests include quantum field theory, elementary particle physics, and cosmology. He is affiliated with the Institute for Nuclear Research (INR) of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Education Rubakov studied physics at Moscow State University, graduating in 1978. He subsequently began doctoral work at the INR, completing his thesis in 1981. Scientific achievements Rubakov is among the best known of contemporary Russian physical theorists, notable for his studies of the cosmological effects of gauge interactions and for the development of novel ideas of space-time and gravity. Rubakov first came to prominence for monopole catalysis of proton decay, a remarkable insight on contemporary field theory. 't Hooft and Polyakov had shown that some Grand Unified Theories predict the existence of massive magnetic monopoles. Rubakov pointed out such a monopole would induce proton decay, leaving an observable footprint in the form of electron neutrinos. The phenomenon was independently suggested by Curtis Callan and has become known as the Callan-Rubakov effect. Together with , Rubakov was one of the first to model spacetime and gravity using ideas from brane cosmology. Rubakov and Shaposhnikov conjectured that we live on a four- dimensional brane embedded in a higher-dimensional universe. Ordinary particles are confined in a potential well which is narrow along the additional dimensions, thereby localizing matter to the brane. His paper with Shaposhnikov and Vadim Kuzmin on the effect of electroweak non-conservation of baryon and lepton numbers at high temperatures is considered fundamental to modern theory about the early universe. He is the author of a well-regarded textbook on field theory and has mentored successful scientists such as .  Awards  Rubakov has been a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences since 1998. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2015.. In 1999 the Russian Academy of Sciences awarded Rubakov and Kuzmin the Friedmann Prize \\"for a series of works on the formation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe\\". He received the 2003 ITEP Pomeranchuk Prize \\"for pioneering contribution [sic] to developing and novel application of nonperturbative methods in field theory\\". In 2005 he was awarded the INR Markov Prize for fundamental physics with . In 2008 he won the J. Hans D. Jensen Prize of the University of Heidelberg, and the Bruno Pontecorvo Prize \\"for his essential contributions to the study of close interrelation among particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology, and to the elaboration of a fundamentally new theory of physical space\\". In 2010 he received the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Julius Wess Prize. The award was presented as part of a celebration of 50 years of teaching and research in particle physics at Karlsruhe, at which Rubakov gave a lecture entitled \\"Towards understanding the origin of inhomogeneities in the Universe\\" . In 2016 Rubakov was awarded the Demidov Prize \\"for fundamental theoretical contributions to the foundations of physics: quantum field theory, elementary particle physics, gravity, the theory of the early universe\\". In 2020 he received the Hamburg Prize for Theoretical Physics, donated with 137.036 Euro.

It was initially titled the East Middlesex Militia, but granted the Royal prefix in 1804. Purpose Like all British county militia units (formed in the 18th and 19th Centuries) the purpose of the unit was to act as a territorially based force of able bodied men to serve in Middlesex and in time of war would report for duty such as defending against invasion by the French. They were not supposed to serve overseas, although the county militias acted as feeder units for officers and recruits to the regular army in times of need.Ann Hudson, Volunteer soldiers in Sussex during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, 1793-1815, Sussex Archaeological Collections 122, pp. 165-81 However in 1878 the unit is recorded (along with other militia and yeomanry regiments) as being allocated to the 3rd Army Corps on mobilisation. In fact in the 2nd Brigade of the 3rd Division, based in the Kent area (although listed as quartered in Hampstead). Insignia The unit's standing orders of 1863 record the regimental insignia as being somewhat unusual, in that it did not include standard royal crown, but featured a five-pointed Saxon Crown atop a shield with the arms of the East Saxon Kingdom (i.e. three stylised Seaxes hilted and pommeled), all surrounded with the regiment's title in a garter. This badge (derivative of the County emblem) was worn when in everyday uniform i.e. on Glengarry headgear, which was common across the British Army and not just Scottish units. More formal headgear of 1829-44 featured a Bell-Top Shako plate of a large crowned star mounted with facetted silver eight pointed star bearing a gilt Garter Star with scroll inscribed \\"\\"Royal East Middx Militia\\"\\" across the tail of the Garter; centrally an enamel silver dome with red translucent Cross of Saint George. Unit history The unit can trace its history back to 7 August 1760 as part of the Middlesex Militia. In 1778 it was based in Hampstead and titled the 1st East Middlesex Militia. By royal order the regiment was later designated the Royal East Middlesex Militia on 24 April 1804. By 1855 it was using the formal title of \\"1st or Royal East Middlesex Regiment of Militia\\". The family archives of David William Murray (3rd Earl of Mansfield) confirm his association with the regiment (as its colonel) between 1798 and 1803. between 1810 & 1855 a Colonel Thomas Wood is recorded as the unit's colonel and its headquarters was in the borough of Hampstead. In 1855 the unit's strength was put between 600 and 700 men. In 1862 a Lieutenant Colonel Alcock is recorded in the unit's standing orders as commanding officer and his headquarters remained at Hampstead. On 1 July 1881 the Royal East Middlesex Militia became embodied in the Duke of Cambridge's Own (Middlesex Regiment) as one of its six associated non-regular battalions (i.e. two militia and four volunteer), all prompted by the Childers Reforms. In 1900 the number of regular Middlesex Regiment battalions was doubled with the formation of a new the 3rd and 4th battalions; and the two militia battalions were renumbered as 5th and 6th battalions of the regiment. By 1908 these militia battalions would become reserve battalions, a reorganisation prompted by the Haldane Reforms. Lieutenant Colonel G E Barker was in command of the 6th Battalion the Middlesex Regiment (which had been the Royal East Middlesex Militia) in 1914 and this unit and the other reserve battalion were based at Mill Hill. The Middlesex Regiment would be absorbed into multiple county infantry regiment amalgamations throughout the 20th and 21st Centuries. Battle honours Like many militia units it sent reinforcements to its associated regiment in the Peninsular War, Crimea and South Africa, but it never deployed as a formed unit overseas. Regimental museum The Middlesex Regiment Museum and that of its militia units was located at Bruce Castle; it was closed in 1992 and its artefacts and holdings were then passed to the National Army Museum in Chelsea.

Gottfried was awarded the Social Responsibility Award from the Western Psychological Association in 2011 \\"based on her research in the field of intrinsic motivation that has contributed to enhancing knowledge about children‚Äôs motivational development and educational attainment.\\" Her co-authored article titled A longitudinal study of academic intrinsic motivation in intellectually gifted children: Childhood through adolescence was awarded the MENSA International Limited Award for Excellence in Research in 1997.  Biography  Gottfried completed a B.A. in Educational Psychology and Counseling from Queens College in 1967. She then completed a M.A. at the University of Chicago in 1968. Later Gottfried attended the Graduate School of the City University of New York where she obtained her Ph.D in Educational / Developmental Psychology in 1975. Gottried is married to her research collaborator, Allen W. Gottfried, and has two children. Gottfried is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association (Divisions 7, 9, and 15), the Association for Psychological Science, and the Western Psychological Association. She was an Inaugural Fellow of the American Educational Research Association. She has served on the editorial boards of various scientific journals including Child Development.  Research  Gottfried is the author of numerous publications pertaining to academic intrinsic motivation, relationships between the home environment, maternal and dual-earner employment status, and children's development, and giftedness. Her co-edited book, Academic motivation and the culture of the school in childhood and adolescence, draws connections between academic motivation and achievement, social relationships, and school culture. In one of her longitudinal studies, Gottfried and colleagues analyzed pathways between math intrinsic motivation and performance in math courses in youth of ages of 9 to 17 years. The study identified links between children's math achievement and motivation, with both declining over the high school years. Gottfried is the co-author, with Allen W. Gottfried and others, of the volume Gifted IQ: Early Developmental Aspects - The Fullerton Longitudinal Study, which summarizes findings of the Fullerton Longitudinal Study that aimed to trace the development of giftedness before identification or labeling of children as gifted. Since 1970, the Fullerton Longitudinal Study has followed the development of over 100 individuals through measures of academic performance, personality traits, home and family environment, and giftedness. One of their co-authored papers on the Fullerton Longitudinal Study reported findings from twelve assessments of intellectual performance taken over a sixteen-year interval. The study aimed to establish the stability of intelligence over four developmental stages: infancy, preschool, childhood, and adolescence. Using latent variable modeling, the authors found a high degree of stability in intelligence from infancy through adolescence, even though there were weaker correlations between IQ scores when measures were taken at longer intervals. That is, the IQ scores at later time-points tended to be less correlated with scores at earlier time-points as the interval between assessment waves increased. Adele and Allen Gottfried also co-edited the book Maternal Employment and Children‚Äôs Development published in 1988. This book addressed concerns about the growing numbers of women with young children who were entering the workforce. Their main finding was that the children of working mothers did not appear to suffer as a consequence of their mother's employment status.  Representative Publications  * Gottfried, A.

Founded in 1874, Matthews and Willard contributed to the expansion of Waterbury's brass processing industry. The plant remained little altered from its last period of expansion c. 1900, and was a good example of period industrial architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, and was demolished in 2012. As of 2018, the site stands vacant. Description and history The Matthews and Willard Factory stood in a densely built industrial and residential area north of downtown Waterbury, just south of the Waterbury Clock Company complex on the east side of North Elm Street. The factory consisted of an interconnected series of brick buildings, bounded on the north by Cherry Avenue and the east by Maple Street. Buildings ranged in height from one to 3-1/2 stories, and were covered by either gabled or flat roofs. Its most prominent feature was a four-story tower, located at the complex's southwest corner and topped by a hip roof. With Matthews and Willard was founded in 1848 by Henry Matthews, who manufactured brass items for use in saddlery. The first building in this complex was built in 1870, after Matthews took on William Stanley as a business partner. Stanley was later replaced by Samuel Willard, and the plant underwent several expansions in the 1880s. The company failed in 1890, a consequence of price fixing by larger competitors, and the plant was taken over by Scovill Manufacturing. It operated there until 1945. The complex was demolished in 2012, with many of its parts recycled into other construction uses.http://archives.rep-am.com/2012/03/16/city-factory- building-to-be-recycled-not-demolished/ See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in New Haven County, Connecticut References Category:National Register of Historic Places in New Haven County, Connecticut Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1874 Category:Waterbury, Connecticut Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2012 ","title":"Matthews and Willard Factory"},{"id":"58574660","text":"Lucia Albino Gilbert is a psychologist known for her research on gender equality and feminist psychology, with a specific focus on women's career development and families with dual careers. She is Professor Emerita of Educational Psychology at The University of Texas at Austin and Professor Emerita of Psychology at Santa Clara University. Gilbert has been honored with awards for teaching, mentorship, and research excellence. Gilbert received the Leona Tyler Award in 2012, and presented her award address on women pursuing careers. She received the Strickland-Daniel Award for Distinguished Mentoring in 2011, the Carolyn Sherif Award from the Society for the Psychology of Women in 1998, and the John Holland Award for Outstanding Achievement in Career and Personality Research in 1989. Gilbert is a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and the American Psychological Association.  Biography  Gilbert was born in Brooklyn, New York. She completed her undergraduate degree in chemistry at Wells College, and her Master of Science degree in chemistry at Yale University. She continued her education at the University of Texas at Austin, where she obtain a PhD in Educational Psychology in 1974 under the supervision of Janet Taylor Spence. She was a member of the faculty at Iowa State University (1973-1975) and the University of Texas at Austin (1975-2006). At UT Austin, Gilbert was appointed the Frank C. Erwin, Jr. Centennial Honors Professor in Educational Psychology and served as the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Studies. Gilbert joined the faculty of Santa Clara University in 2006, where she served as the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs from 2006-2010.  Research  Gilbert's seminal work has focused on men and women in two-career families, i.e., where both parents have paid employment, and the impact of both parents being employed on parenting, household work, and career paths. Her research has examined personal factors, such as interests and abilities, relationship factors, such as power-dynamics and partner support, and societal factors, such as workplace policies, the availability of child care, mentorship and other forms of support, as influences on men and women's occupational and family roles. Gilbert has authored several books on dual career families and related topics. She published the first and only empirically-based book to date on men in dual- career families, Men in Dual-career Families: Current Realities and Future Prospects (1985). Later books include Sharing it All: The Rewards and Struggles of Two-Career Families (1988), Two Careers, One Family: The Promise of Gender Equality (1993), and Gender and Sex in Counseling and Psychotherapy (with Murray Scher). In recent years, Gilbert has collaborated with her husband, John C. Gilbert, on research focusing on the careers of women working in the traditionally male-dominated field of winemaking, and their progress. Their research documented that 9.8% of California wineries have a lead woman winemaker, and that proportional to their representation in the field, wineries whose lead winemakers are women are more highly acclaimed ‚Äì an indicator that women were able to succeed in this male-dominated field.

She has co- edited several books including Research Methods in Child Language: A Practical Guide, Blackwell Handbook of Language Development, and Childhood Bilingualism: Research on Infancy Through School Age.  Biography  Hoff completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Education at the University of Michigan in 1972. After completing a Master of Science degree at Rutgers University, Hoff returned to the University of Michigan where she completed her PhD in Psychology in 1981 under the supervision of Marilyn Shatz. Her dissertation, which was funded by the National Science Foundation, focused on the role of linguistic input in children's language development. Prior to joining the faculty of Florida Atlantic University, Hoff was a member of the faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. Hoff has conducted extensive research on the acquisition of language in different social contexts and on bilingualism and dual language development, funded by grants from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Hoff's research has emphasized how socioeconomic disparities and other environmental factors impact children's language development. In particular, her work highlights how variation in the quality of maternal child-directed speech across families may explain individual differences in children's language development trajectories. Hoff has conducted extensive longitudinal research on monolingual and bilingual children's language development in South Florida, underscoring how variation in the amount of exposure to each language impacts rates of language development. She has shown that in the early stages of language development, the English skills of children learning Spanish and English at the same time lag behind the English skills of monolingual children. However, when bilingual children's skills in both of their languages are considered, they know as much or more than monolingual children. Growing up in a bilingual homes does not guarantee children's success in acquiring Spanish. One relevant factor is language use. Children who only hear but do not speak Spanish are less likely to end up as Spanish speakers.

It is the major component produced during the acid-catalysed pyrolysis of cellulose, D-glucose, and levoglucosan.  History  The compound was first identified in 1970 as a product of the thermal decomposition of cellulose.  Production  Pyrolysis of Cellulose to form Levoglucosenone The primary way of obtaining levoglucosenone is via pyrolysis of carbohydrates, particularly cellulose. Levoglucosenone can be derived from biomass or from other cellulosic materials including domestic/commercial waste paper. The availability of multiple sources is a key advantage when compared to other platform chemicals which are solely derived from biomass. Selectivity can be improved using an acid catalyst, such as phosphoric acid. Zeolites and solid superacids can also be used, as well as ionic liquids. A sample of microcrystalline cellulose is first pretreated with catalytic amounts of an acid, such as phosphoric acid, and then heated to 270-300¬∞C, affording a bio-oil. Alongside levoglucosenone as a major product, 2-furfuraldehyde is also formed in significant quantities as an impurity at 5-10%. The bio-oil can be vacuum distilled, resulting in purified levoglucosenone. The use of polar, aprotic solvents such as THF, Œ≥-valerolactone and sulfolane has been found to improve pyrolytic yields, as the solvents cause swelling of the cellulose and inhibit repolymerisation back to levoglucosan. These solvents also promote catalytic dehydration of levoglucosan to levoglucosenone. Microwave irradiation of microcrystalline cellulose can also be used to produce levoglucosenone.  Uses  As a highly functionalized, chiral compound, levoglucosenone has uses as a building block in organic synthesis to produce a wide variety of natural and non-natural compounds. Recently, the Australian company Circa developed the Furacell‚Ñ¢ technology, a continuous process to convert a wide range of cellulosic biomass into levoglucosenone. From then on, levoglucosenone has been considered a promising bio-renewable platform for the production of commodity chemicals, being especially interesting the new insight provided by Huber and co-workers into how to transform this molecule into Œ±,œâ-diols, monomers for the production of polyesters and polyurethanes. Nowadays, the spotlight is on the use of heterogeneous catalysts to yield hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis derived products. In this sense, Pd supported on carbon, alumina, and silica- alumina can be used to obtain a variety of products via hydrogenation (i.e. dihydrolevoglucosenone and levoglucosanol), and hydrogenolysis (i.e. tetrahydrofurandimethanol (THFDM) and 1,6-hexanediol), tuning the selectivity by simply changing reaction conditions. More recently, Pd and Pt supported on zirconium oxide proved to be efficient catalysts to obtain either dihydrolevoglucosenone or levoglucosanol, respectively, under mild reaction conditions, taking advantage of the different selectivity of these metals towards the hydrogenation of specific functional features.

Life  = Provenance and early years = Arthur Lieberasch was born in D√∂beln, the third of his parent's ten children. His father, a tool-maker by trade, worked in the town's cigar factory. He attended school locally, and trained as a machinist. In 1900 or 1901 he joined the Metal Workers' Union. He joined the (recently rebranded and relaunched) Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1905. As a union shop steward and member of workers' councils he was frequently reprimanded. His union activism nevertheless meant that his reputation grew across the whole of Saxony. = Trades union activist = The decision of the SPD leadership to back parliamentary votes to fund the war was controversial among party members from the outset, and as slaughter on the front-line and destitution on the home front intensified, tensions within the party increased. That led to a split. Arthur Lieberasch was among the anti-war left- wingers who broke away to form the so-called Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD) in 1917, being a founder member of the new party in Saxony. During 1917 Lieberasch was among the leaders of the strikes that broke out in Leipzig - initially mostly in the munitions factories - in response to the food shortages which had intensified during the so-called \\"turnip winter\\" of 1917 and in the aftermath an announcement by the authorities (accompanied by government statements trumpeting the success of submarine warfare), on 15 April 1917, of a cut in the weekly bread ration from 1,350g to 450g. Strikes broke out in various cities in response to the food crisis: Leipzig was exceptional for the extent to which conservative elements in the Social Democratic mainstream collaborated with the authorities to frustrate the strikers, reflecting the particularly stark divisions in the city between moderates and radicals on the political left. Lieberasch's role as a strike leader led to his being charged with High Treason. However, the revolutionary outbursts in the German ports and cities directly after the war left the authorities with more urgent priorities, and his case never went to trial. = Revolutionary and Communist = The revolutionary period lasted approximately nine months. Arthur Lieberasch took a leading position on the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils in Leipzig. Both the revolutionaries and the volunteer militias (Freikorps) of former soldiers who resisted them saw the Russian Revolution as a possible template for a post-imperial Germany. The Communist Party of Germany had been established in Berlin at a three-day congress held between 30 December 1918 and 1 January 1919. The USPD itself broke apart at a party convention held at Halle on 12 October 1920. The left-wing majority among those present - which included Lieberasch - voted to join the Moscow sponsored Communist International (\\"Comintern\\"), and a few weeks later, on 4 December 1920, the left-wing USPD members formally switched their memberships to the Communist Party, which is frequently identified in sources from the early 1920s as the United Communist Party (\\"Vereinigte Kommunistische Partei Deutschland\\" / VKPD). Like many in his position, he now undertook a succession of official functions within the party. It was also as a communist that in 1921 Arthur Lieberasch was elected to membership of the Leipzig city council (\\"Stadtrat\\"), becoming the leader of the communist group on the council in 1927. = Regional parliamentarian = Regional elections were held in November 1922. Arthur Lieberasch was elected to the Parliament of Saxony (\\"S√§chsischer Landtag\\") as a Communist Party member. The Communists polled well enough to deny the SPD an overall majority and the regional government that emerged initially in Saxony was a minority SPD one. The Communist group became the second largest in the Landtag in 1926. Party comrades submitted Lieberasch as their candidate to be First Deputy President of the Chamber, but the centrist and right-wing \\"bourgeois\\" parties joined together to block his election. The 1920s were a period of political instability in Saxon regional politics. Lieberasch was re-elected to it in 1926. = Party officer = As a member of the regional party leadership team (\\"KPD-Bezirksleitung\\") for western Saxony, Arthur Lieberasch was Secretary for Trades Union questions. In 1923, at the eighth party conference, he had been elected to the party's \\"Trades Union Commission\\" (\\"Gewerkschaftskommission\\"). By this time he was seen as part of the right win within the Communist Party which, during the 1920s, was falling increasingly into the hands of a younger generation of left-wingers. = Party split = The Communist Party finally split early in 1929. Within the Saxony party leadership his traditional trades union principals were not naturally compatible with the thesis of \\"social fascism\\" propounded by the hard-line doctrinaire Stalinists such as Rudolf Renner and Walter Ulbricht who were becoming increasingly powerful. In January 1929 Lieberasch was one of many excluded from the party around that time who now became founder members of the so-called Communist Party (Opposition) (\\"Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (Opposition)\\" / KPO), and devoted himself to building up the party in Saxony. In the course of desperate attempts to unify the parties of the left in order to try and block the seemingly unstoppable rise of the Nazi Party, the KPO itself fragmented, but Lieberasch was among those who remained loyal to it until (and beyond) 1933. = Into exile = The Nazis took power in January 1933 and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Non-Nazis with any sort of record of political activism, especially if it involved the Communist Party or the trades union movement, were at particular risk from the authorities. During the first half of 1933 many were arrested or fled abroad. Following an instruction from the party leadership, Arthur Liberasch crossed the frontier into Switzerland and settled in Schaffhausen, then as now on the edge of a small Swiss enclave surrounded on three sides, for reasons of topography, by German territory. He lived in Schaffhausen under conditions of serious impoverishment. For as long as possible he nevertheless supported illegal antifascist work across the frontier in Germany, working on the \\"Schaffhausener Arbeiterzeitung\\" (newspaper) and organising the transfer of printed material into Germany. When first he arrived in Schaffhausen he was welcomed by Walther Bringolf, from whom he received significant support. Bringolf was a locally based leader of the Swiss Communist Party (Opposition) (\\" Kommunistische Partei der Schweiz-Opposition\\" / , KPS-O), a natural ally of the eponymous German party. After 1935, when Bringholf switched his allegiance to the Social Democrats, Lieberasch's life became more of a struggle. The workhouse found him work chopping wood. Fellow tramps knew that he was German and therefore identified him as a Nazi. There are nevertheless indications that until around 1938 Lieberasch was able to remain in touch with underground resistance groups in Leipzig. In 1939, like others in his position, he was deprived of his citizenship in absentia by the German government which left him stateless. It seems that he nevertheless received some financial support from international organisations that had been close to the German KPO in the past. = After the war = War, which had returned in 1939, formally ended in May 1945. Leipzig was now included in the large central portion of what had been Germany that was administered as the Soviet occupation zone (relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany)). It was not till June 1948, as his wife lay dying, that Arthur Liberasch was permitted to return to Lepizig. He lost no time in joining the Socialist Unity Party (SED), formed - if only in the Soviet zone - a couple of years earlier through a contentious merger of the old Communist Party and the Social Democrats. He now applied for recognition as a \\"Fighter against Fascism\\" (\\"K√§mpfer gegen den Faschismus\\" / KgF). His application was turned down in January 1949 by the Mayor's Control Commission of the Municipal Section for Victims of Fascism\\". Walter Ulbricht, with whom he had clashed in the 1920s when they were both members of the Leipzig Communist Party, was by now the most powerful German in the Soviet occupation zone, as was a man with a famously long memory. However, Lieberasch lodged an objection with the appropriate appeal court and was recognised as a KgF in September 1949. The month he was given a job as a payroll clerk with VEB Vesta, a Leipzig-based iron and steel producer. During the early 1950s the East German leadership revisited the party ructions which had led the Communist Party to split in 1928/29: surviving former KPO activists from that time were subjected to a succession of investigations and reprisals. Invited to write a statement of self-criticism, as was the normal Stalinist custom under such circumstances in East Germany, Arthur Lieberasch confined himself to a single sentence, from which the expected expressions of deep remorse were conspicuously absent: \\"Creating the KPO was not a mistake, but simply an offence against [party] discipline\\" (\\"Die Bildung der KPO war kein Fehler, sondern nur ein Versto√ü gegen die Disziplin\\"). He was excluded from SED party membership in 1952. Particularly strident condemnation of Lieberasch had come in 1951 from Ernst Lohagen, the leader of the dominating SED group in the Saxon regional parliament (\\"Landtag\\"): \\"This Lieberasch today has his agents in the party. Not only that: he is himself a member of our SED (party) in the Leipzig region. This long standing 'professional enemy of the party' recently wrote a statement to the party about Brandler as follows, in what amounted to a moral justification of Brandler, 'Brandler was just another poor swine like me, and like me had nothing to wear', and so on\\" (\\"Dieser Lieberasch hat heute nicht nur seine Agenten in der Partei, sondern ist selbst Mitglied unserer SED im Kreis Leipzig. Dieser alte professionelle Parteifeind schrieb vor kurzem in einer Erkl√§rung an die Partei √ºber Brandler folgendes, was einer moralischen Rechtfertigung Brandlers gleichkommt: 'Brandler war genau so ein armes Schwein wie ich und hatte auch nichts anzuziehen', und so fort\\"). If Lohagen hoped to ingratiate himself with the leadership with this forthright criticism of Lieberasch, he failed. His own fall from grace, from a far higher level than that achieved after the war by Lieberasch, followed a few months after that of the older man. Meanwhile, comrades tempted to make contact with Arthur Lieberasch after 1952 risked party sanctions including, in some cases, exclusion from the party for themselves. By 1957, taking its queue somewhat belatedly from Comrade Khrushchev, the East German government implemented a cautious amount of De-Stalinization during the course of which Arthur Lieberasch was readmitted to the party. During 1958 he was awarded the Medal for Fighters Against Fascism, which had initially been withheld from him. Arthur Lieberasch died in Leipzig on 10 June 1967.

After several positions as chaplain, Kempf became the parish priest of the Church of the Heilig Geist in Riederwald, part of Frankfurt, from 1942 to 1949. On 25 July 1949, Kempf was consecrated as Bishop of Limburg, succeeding Ferdinand Dirichs who had died in a car accident. He was ordained by Cardinal Joseph Frings, Archbishop of Cologne, assisted by Albert Stohr, Bishop of Mainz, and the US bishop and later first Apostolic Nuncio in the German Federal Republic, Aloisius Joseph Muench. As bishop, Kempf contended with the aftermath of the war, including the rebuilding of damaged churches, integration of displaced persons (Heimatvertriebene), and establishment of new parishes in the major cities of Frankfurt and Wiesbaden. He took part in the Second Vatican Council between 1962 and 1965 and introduced its changes in the diocese in an exemplary way. He promoted spiritual discourse and open dialogue (\\"geistige Auseinandersetzung und offenen Dialog), introduced liturgical reform, and a structure in which priest and lay people cooperated. Particularly interested in church music, he founded the Limburger Domsingknaben boys' choir in 1967. From 1969, he gave more influence to the councils of mostly lay people who were democratically elected in parishes. He was regarded as conservative but tolerant and open to reform. On 10 August 1981, his 75th birthday, Kempf requested his retirement, which was granted. He died on 9 October 1982 in Wiesbaden and is buried in the Limburg Cathedral.  Awards and legacy  In 1973, Kempf was awarded the Gro√ües Verdienstkreuz of the Federal Republic,Bekanntgabe von Verleihungen des Verdienstordens der Bundesrepublik Deutschland. Bundesanzeiger. Year 25, No. 85, 8 May 1973. to which a star and Schulterband were added in 1981. He was made an honorary citizen of Wiesbaden in 1976. The University of T√ºbingen awarded an honorary doctorate of theology to him in 1981. He was also an honorary citizen of Limburg from 18 June 1974. The central meeting house of the diocese of Limburg in Wiesbaden-Naurod, which he had planned as a place of spiritual intercourse and open dialogue, is named after him.

The name refers to the scenario where a maid could subvert a device left unattended in a hotel room ‚Äì but the concept itself also applies to situations such as a device being intercepted while in transit, or taken away temporarily by airport or law enforcement personnel.  Overview  = Origin = In a 2009 blog post, security analyst Joanna Rutkowska coined the term \\"Evil Maid Attack\\"; due to hotel rooms being a common place where devices are left unattended. The post detailed a method for compromising the firmware on an unattended computer via an external USB flash drive ‚Äì and therefore bypassing TrueCrypt disk encryption. D. Defreez, a computer security professional, first mentioned the possibility of an evil maid attack on Android smartphones in 2011. He talked about the WhisperCore Android distribution and its ability to provide disk encryption for Androids. = Notability = In 2007, former U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez was allegedly targeted by an evil maid attack during a business trip to China. He left his computer unattended during a trade talk in Beijing, and he suspected that his device had been compromised. Although the allegations have yet to be confirmed or denied, the incident caused the U.S. government to be more wary of physical attacks. In 2009, Symantec CTO Mark Bregman was advised by several U.S. agencies to leave his devices in the U.S. before travelling to China. He was instructed to buy new ones before leaving and dispose of them when he returned so that any physical attempts to retrieve data would be ineffective.  Methods of attack  = Classic evil maid = The attack begins when the victim leaves their device unattended. The attacker can then proceed to tamper with the system. If the victim's device does not have password protection or authentication, an intruder can turn on the computer and immediately access the victim's information. However, if the device is password protected, as with full disk encryption, the firmware of the device needs to be compromised, usually done with an external drive. The compromised firmware often provides the victim with a fake password prompt identical to the original. Once the password is input, the compromised firmware sends the password to the attacker and removes itself after a reboot. In order to successfully complete the attack, the attacker must return to the device once it has been unattended a second time to steal the now-accessible data. Another method of attack is through a DMA attack in which an attacker accesses the victim's information through hardware devices that connect directly to the physical address space. The attacker simply needs to connect to the hardware device in order to access the information. = Network evil maid = An evil maid attack can also be done by replacing the victim's device with an identical device. If the original device has a bootloader password, then the attacker only needs to acquire a device with an identical bootloader password input screen. If the device has a lock screen, however, the process becomes more difficult as the attacker must acquire the background picture to put on the lock screen of the mimicking device. In either case, when the victim inputs their password on the false device, the device sends the password to the attacker, who is in possession of the original device. The attacker can then access the victim's data.  Vulnerable interfaces  = Legacy BIOS = Legacy BIOS is considered insecure against evil maid attacks. Its architecture is old, updates and Option ROMs are unsigned, and configuration is unprotected. Additionally, it does not support secure boot. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to boot from an external drive and compromise the firmware. The compromised firmware can then be configured to send keystrokes to the attacker remotely. = Unified Extensible Firmware Interface = Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) provides many necessary features for mitigating evil maid attacks. For example, it offers a framework for secure boot, authenticated variables at boot-time, and TPM initialization security. Despite these available security measures, platform manufacturers are not obligated to use them. Thus, security issues may arise when these unused features allow an attacker to exploit the device. = Full disk encryption systems = Many full disk encryption systems, such as TrueCrypt and PGP Whole Disk Encryption, are susceptible to evil maid attacks due to their inability to authenticate themselves to the user. An attacker can still modify disk contents despite the device being powered off and encrypted. The attacker can modify the encryption system's loader codes to steal passwords from the victim. The ability to create a communication channel between the bootloader and the operating system to remotely steal the password for a disk protected by FileVault 2, is also explored. On a macOS system, this attack has additional implications due to ‚Äúpassword forwarding‚Äù technology, in which a user's account password also serves as the FileVault password, enabling an additional attack surface through privilege escalation. = Thunderbolt = In 2019 a vulnerability named \\"Thunderclap\\" in Intel Thunderbolt ports found on many PCs was announced which could allow a rogue actor to gain access to the system via direct memory access (DMA). This is possible despite use of an input/output memory management unit (IOMMU). This vulnerability was largely patched by vendors. This was followed in 2020 by \\"Thunderspy\\" which is believed to be unpatchable and allows similar exploitation of DMA to gain total access to the system bypassing all security features. = Any unattended device = Any unattended device can be vulnerable to a network evil maid attack. If the attacker knows the victim's device well enough, they can replace the victim's device with an identical model with a password-stealing mechanism. Thus, when the victim inputs their password, the attacker will instantly be notified of it and be able to access the stolen device's information.  Mitigation  = Detection = One approach is to detect that someone is close to, or handling the unattended device. Proximity alarms, motion detector alarms, and wireless cameras, can be used to alert the victim when an attacker is nearby their device, thereby nullifying the surprise factor of an evil maid attack. The \\"Haven\\" Android app was created in 2017 by Edward Snowden to do such monitoring, and transmit the results to the user's smartphone. In the absence of the above, tamper-evident technology of various kinds can be used to detect whether the device has been taken apart ‚Äì including the low-cost solution of putting glitter over the screw holes. After an attack has been suspected, the victim can have their device checked to see if any malware was installed, but this is challenging. Suggested approaches are checking the hashes of selected disk sectors and partitions. = Prevention = If the device is under surveillance at all times, an attacker cannot perform an evil maid attack. If left unattended, the device may also be placed inside a lockbox so that an attacker will not have physical access to it. However, there will be situations, such as a device being taken away temporarily by airport or law enforcement personnel where this is not practical. Basic security measures such as having the latest up-to-date firmware and shutting down the device before leaving it unattended prevent an attack from exploiting vulnerabilities in legacy architecture and allowing external devices into open ports, respectively. CPU-based disk encryption systems, such as TRESOR and Loop- Amnesia, prevent data from being vulnerable to a DMA attack by ensuring it does not leak into system memory. TPM-based secure boot has been shown to mitigate evil maid attacks by authenticating the device to the user. It does this by unlocking itself only if the correct password is given by the user and if it measures that no unauthorized code has been executed on the device. These measurements are done by root of trust systems, such as Microsoft's BitLocker and Intel's TXT technology. The Anti Evil Maid program builds upon TPM-based secure boot and further attempts to authenticate the device to the user.

Because goddess Medha is considered as a form of Saraswathi, Medha Suktam is quite popular as a hymn to goddess Saraswathi; as a prayer seeking intelligence and capability to learn. There are at least two popular versions of Medha Suktam. One version is a set of six verses from Mahanarayana Upanishad, which forms part of Taittiriya Aranyaka in Krishna Yajurveda. There is one more version comprising nine mantras, which appears as a khila sukta (khilani) to the Rig Veda. There is one more set of five verses in the Atharva Veda, which too reads like a hymn to goddess Medha, but this is not popularly recognized or chanted as such. In essence, Medha Suktam relates to the worship of knowledge visualized as a goddess, and has been commonly chanted as a prayer to Saraswati.The meaning of the world Medha (in the feminine gender, as used in Medha Suktam) is \\"power of understanding endowed with consciousness\\". The other meaning of Medha (in the masculine gender) is Yajna, which is not applicable in this context. Content Medha suktam from the Mahanarayana Upanishad is a collective prayer, i.e., the supplicants refer to themselves in the plural. The context suggests that it is recited by a group of students who are pursuing education, spiritual education in particular. It praises the benevolent nature of goddess Medha. It then describes how with the blessings of goddess Medha, one could become a rishi or a brahmagnani (knower of brahman). The hymn also beseeches Indra, Agni, the two Ashwins, Surya and also goddess Saraswathi (could be the Saraswathi river or the goddess of wisdom as we know her) to grant Medha (i.e., intelligence). Another popular version of Medha Suktam, which is a supplementary sukta to the Rig Veda, is an individual prayer. It requests sage Angiras, the saptarishis, Indra, Agni, Brahma, Varuna, the Ashwins, and goddess Saraswathi to bestow Medha (intelligence). It however refers to Medha as a goddess just once. The five verses from Atharva Veda too address a goddess called Medha, and also seek Medha (intelligence) from Agni, Varuna, Vayu, etc., but the term Saraswathi is not used here. The Medha suktas from the Vedas are from the centuries before the common era, when the conceptualization of Saraswathi as the goddess of knowledge and wisdom was in an evolutionary state. Though the two popular versions of Medha Suktam explained above also invoke a goddess called Saraswathi, the emphasis is more on goddess Medha and on Medha (knowledge) itself. However, as goddess Medha commands the same role as Saraswathi, the verses from the vedas referred to as Medha Suktam, have been popularly accepted and recited as prayers to goddess Saraswathi since millennia, with appropriate invocation and conclusive verses added to them.

The ELISpot Assay is also a form of immunostaining since it is classified as a technique that uses antibodies to detect a protein analyte, with the word analyte referring to any biological or chemical substance being identified or measured. The FluoroSpot Assay is a variation of the ELISpot assay. The FluoroSpot Assay uses fluorescence in order to analyze multiple analytes, meaning it can detect the secretion of more than one type of protein.  History  Cecil Czerkinsky first described ELISpot in 1983 as a new way to quantify the production of an antigen-specific immunoglobulin by hybridoma cells. In 1988, Czerkinsky developed an ELISA spot assay that quantified the secretion of a lymphokine by T cells. In the same year, dual- color ELISpot was combined with computer imaging for the first time, which allowed for the enumeration and analysis of spots. 1988 also marked the first use of membrane-bottomed plates for performing these assays.  Mechanism of ELISpot  #Antibody coating: Throughout the ELISpot Assay technique, different substances are added to and washed away from wells. Wells are found on a laboratory plate with tiny dishes/bowls that can be filled with a substance to be examined; the amount of wells on a plate varies, but it usually ranges from 16-100. The first substance added to the wells are cytokine specific monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies coat the walls of the wells for future binding to cytokine. The monoclonal antibodies means that the antibody is produced from a single cell lineage, and is only able to bind to one protein epitope. Polyclonal antibodies, on the other hand, are capable of binding to multiple epitopes of the same protein. #Cell incubation: The desired cells being observed and analyzed are added to the wells. Each well can have the presence or absence of stimuli that activate the secretion of cytokine in cells. During cell incubation, the cells are allowed to react to any present stimuli and secrete cytokine. There are many procedures and methods to follow to ensure proper cell handling. To make sure that cells are of high quality, cells in blood samples should be lightly agitated if stored for longer than 3 hours, the blood samples should be diluted in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) before being stored, and the blood samples should not have granulocytes. Any cells that have been cryopreserved and thawed should be allowed to rest for an hour or more at 37 degrees Celsius (the typical temperature of the human body). There are also many things that should be taken into consideration when incubating the cells, such as making sure that the cells do not experience sudden movements that could affect spot formation, or that the incubator's humidity is high enough to avoid excessive evaporation and drying out the wells. #Cytokine capture: Since the cells are surrounded by cytokine specific monoclonal antibodies that coat the walls of the wells, cytokine that has been secreted by the incubated cells will start to attach to the antibodies at a specific epitope. #Detection antibodies: At this point, the wells must be rinsed in order to get rid of the cells and any other undesirable substances. All that should remain are the cytokine specific monoclonal antibodies and any cytokine that bonded to the antibodies. Biotinylated cytokine-specific detection antibodies are then added to the well. These cytokine-specific detection antibodies will bind to any cytokine that is left in the well since the cytokine is still attached to the first set of antibodies used. Since the cytokine attached to the first set of antibodies coating the wells, the cytokine was not washed away when the wells were rinsed. #Streptavidin-enzyme conjugate: Streptavidin-enzyme conjugate is added to the wells in order to bind with the detection antibodies. The purpose of biotinylating the cytokine-specific detection antibodies added to the wells in the previous step is so that the antibody can bind to the new streptavidin- enzyme conjugate. Biotinylation basically creates a strong affinity between the biotin on the cytokine-specific antibody and the streptavidin on the conjugate. #Addition of substrate: A substrate is added to the wells, and is catalyzed by the enzyme conjugate added in the previous step. This reaction forms insoluble precipitate that forms spots in the wells. The substrate that you use in this step will depend on the type of enzyme used in the previous step. If streptavidin-ALP (streptavidin and alkaline phosphatase conjugate) is used, then using BCIP/NBT-plus (a mixture of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride) as a substrate will produce more distinct spots that are easier to analyze. If streptavidin-HRP (streptavidin and horseradish peroxidase conjugate) is used, then using TMB (tetramethylbenzidine) as a substrate will produce better results. #Analysis: The spots that are formed can then be read on an automated ELISpot reader, or counted under a dissection microscope, and further used to calculate the frequency of cytokine secretion. = Mechanism of FluoroSpot= The FluoroSpot assay is very similar to the ELISpot assay. The main difference is that the FluoroSpot assay is able to analyze the presence of multiple analytes on one plate of wells, whereas the ELISpot assay can only analyze one analyte at a time. The FluoroSpot assay accomplishes this by using fluorescence rather than an enzymatic reaction for detection. The steps for a FluoroSpot assay are also similar, with a few differences. # Antibody Coating: Similar to the ELISpot, cytokine-specific monoclonal capture antibodies are added to a plate with wells. For both assays, the plates are ethanol-treated to avoid contamination and skewed data collection. For the FluoroSpot assay, a mixture of different types of capture antibodies are attached to the wells in order to detect multiple types of analytes. In order to get optimal results with the ELISpot and the FluoroSpot assay, proper plate coating techniques should be followed. The plates should be treated with ethanol, washed, and then coated with antibodies. Ethanol treatment methods also vary depending on the type of plates that are used. For MSIP and IPFL plates, you should add 15 micro liters of 35% ethanol to all of the wells. Allow the ethanol to sit in the wells for one minute, and then pour it out. For MAIPSWU plates, you should instead add 50 micro liters of 70% ethanol to all of the wells. Allow the ethanol to sit in the wells for two minutes, and then pour it out. After you have treated the wells with ethanol, you need to wash all of the wells with 200 micro liters of sterile water. This washing process should be repeated for a total of 5 times. Once the wells have been treated with ethanol and washed, the cytokine- specific monoclonal capture antibodies can be added to each well. # Cell Incubation: Cell are added to the wells and are incubated in the presence or absence of stimuli that affect protein secretion. # Cytokine Capture: Proteins/analytes that are secreted by the incubated cells will bind to the capture antibodies attached to the wells during the first step. # Detection Antibodies: Similar to the ELISpot, once the wells are rinsed to get rid of the cells and other substances that we are not interested in identifying or measuring, a biotinylated detection antibody is added (this is specific for one type of analyte that you wish to quantify) and then tag-labeled detection antibodies are added for the second and third types of analytes being studied. # Fluorophore-labeled Conjugates: Instead of adding a streptavidin-enzyme conjugate, the detection of multiple analytes is amplified in the FluoroSpot with the use of fluorophore-labeled anti-tag antibody and streptavidin- fluorophore conjugate. A fluorescence enhancer solution is also added during this step in order to enhance the signals later used when analyzing the fluorescence colors in the wells. This fluorescence is what makes it possible for the FluoroSpot to analyze and compare multiple analytes, unlike the ELISpot. # Analysis: Since the FluoroSpot relies on the use of fluorescence and not an enzymatic reaction, there is no need for a step that adds a substrate to react with enzymes (as needed for the ELISpot). The last step for the FluoroSpot assay is to analyze the fluorophores under an automated fluorescence reader that has separate filters for the different fluorophores being analyzed. These filters should be selected for the specific wavelengths of the fluorophores if you want accurate measurements. Since the FluoroSpot assay identifies and quantifies the presence of multiple analytes, it is possible that the absorption of one analyte can affect the secretion of another analyte; this is called capture effects. The affect an analyte has on another analyte could be positive or negative (the production of the second analyte can either increase or decrease). To counteract capture effects, it is possible to use co-stimulation in order to bypass the decreased production of an analyte. This is when a second antibody that stimulates the production of the same analyte is added to the wells.  Applications of ELISpot and FluoroSpot  The ELISpot and FluoroSpot assays can be used in many research fields: vaccine development, cancer, allergies, monocytes/macrophages/dendritic cells characterization, apolipoproteins analysis, and veterinary research. With the ELISpot, you can study antigen- specific cytokine responses, antibody specific secreting cells, tumor antigens, granzyme B and Perforin release by T cells, vaccine efficacy, epitope mapping, cytotoxic T-cell activity, detection of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, vaccine-induced antibody responses, antigen-specific memory B cells, and much more. More specifically, the T-cell ELISpot assay is used to characterize T-cell subsets. This is because the assay can detect the production of cytokines IFN-y, IL-2, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. The first three cytokines are produced by Th1 cells, while the last three are produced by Th2 cells. Measuring T-cell responses through cytokine production also makes it possible to study vaccine efficacy. With T-cell FluoroSpot, you can monitor tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. You can also analyze the IFN-y cytokine and granzyme B secretion in order to assess cytotoxic T-cell responses. Both of these are used for cancer research. With B-cell FluoroSpot, vaccine efficacy can also be observed by quantifying the secretion of IgG, IgA, and IgM before and after a vaccination. This analysis of multiple immunoglobulins is made possible because of the fluorescence method used in the FluoroSpot.

Written poetry in the Sesotho language has existed for over 150 years however, the oral poetry has been practiced throughout Basotho history. Forms of Sotho poetry The classical form of Sotho oral poetry is called ‚Äòdithoko‚Äô. This type of Sotho poetry was inspired by tribal wars and battles fought by the Basotho people. However, urbanisation, a changing economy, and modernism have inspired new forms of poetry to develop in the Sotho culture. The new forms of dithoko include the difela, 'mine workers' chants', and the diboko, the latter which are 'family odes', and are still performed in rural areas of Lesotho and the Free State province of South Africa. Like most other oral forms of poetry, the authors are unknown and poem are passed down from generation to generation. There is a strong link between Sotho music and Sotho poetry. A Sesotho praise poet characteristically uses assonance and alliteration. Eloquence or ‚Äòbokheleke‚Äô is highly valued in the sotho culture and people who possess this skill are respected. The praise poetry (dithoko) is not a musical form but, it is incorporated in most Sesotho songs.Laurie Levine. The Drumcaf√©'s Traditional Music of South Africa. Jacana Media, 2005. Pages 117-118 Praise poetry is highly developed Sotho oral literature and plays a significant role in the study and recording of history as it contains a large amount of information about past significant people and events. Every Sotho king has had a designated praise poet who praised his ancestry and deeds. In addition, the praise poets also praised tribal warriors and national heroes.B. W. Andrzejewski, S. Pilaszewicz, W. Tyloch. Literatures in African Languages: Theoretical Issues and Sample Surveys. Cambridge University Press, 21 Nov 1985 Page 612 A description of a Sotho praise poet by a missionary in the 1800s: ‚ÄòDuring the early part of our sojourn among (the Sotho), we often heard them recite, with very dramatic gestures, certain pieces, which were not easy of comprehension, and which appeared to be distinguished from the ordinary discourse, by the elevation of the sentiment, powerful ellipses, daring metaphors, and very accentuated rhythm. The natives called these recitations praises‚ÄôLaurie Levine. The Drumcaf√©'s Traditional Music of South Africa. Jacana Media, 2005. Pages 117-118 A group of Basotho people incorporating music and poetry together History Christian missionaries from the 1800s played an important role in publishing Basotho oral poetry through their missionary journal called ‚Äò‚ÄôLeselinyana la Lesotho‚Äô‚Äô (translates ‚Äòlittle light of Lesotho). Some of the first literary works published by the Sotho people included praise poems and idioms which were accompanied by explanatory notes. Famous publications made during this time included Azriel‚Äôs Sekese‚Äôs transcriptions of ‚Äòdithoko‚Äô‚Äô of Moshoeshoe I between 1893 and 1906 and Mangoaela‚Äôs Lithoko tsa marena a Basotho (translates ‚ÄòPraise poems of Basotho chiefs‚Äô which started as a series from the 21 November 1919 till 10 June 1921. With the discovery of diamonds in Kimberley and gold in South Africa in 1866 and 1886 respectively, many mining companies allowed for the migration of Basotho men in order to create a larger labour force. It was during this time that a new form of poetry called difela tsa ditsamayahana simply known as difela emerged and was recited throughout their journeys to the mines and back to their villages. These journeys were usually by foot and took several weeks, it was during these weeks that Basotho men composed new poems and chanted them throughout their travels. The contents of ‚Äòdifela‚Äô mostly consist of stories of economic hardship, exploitation and usually had strong political comments. Difela are most often egocentric and reflect the male migrant existential self-understanding as a contemporary hero. ‚ÄòDifela‚Äô often saw themselves as ordinary people who were confronted by the dangers of new territory while ‚Äòexiled‚Äô from home and family. Difela are vastly different from Dithoka and the latter are primarily declaratory in delivery while Difela are said in a soft, chant-like fashion. Diboko are like ‚Äòfamily-odes‚Äô and have existed since the beginning of know Basotho history. This form of poetry allows for different families and clans to be able to distinguish themselves from other groups. Every Sotho child is expected to learn the praise poems of their families and be able to confidently recite them during festivities of initiation. Praise poetry is also incorporated into sotho children's games.Tsiu, William Moruti. Basotho Oral Poetry At the Beginning of the Twenty-first Century. Kwara State University Press, 28 Mar 2018 pages page 15-22 A Sotho man reciting 'Difela' in the 21st century Women and poetry Women‚Äôs ‚Äòdifela‚Äô performances occurred for the first time in illegal shebeens or taverns. In this setting, the women, brew and sell beer to migrants at home on leave during the diamond and gold boom. The women would entertain the miners with poetry, song, dance and sexual companionship. These ‚Äòbar women‚Äô are known as matekatse, translated ‚Äòto wonder about‚Äô or ‚Äòodd job‚Äô. Thus the ‚Äòshebeen songs‚Äô of independent women are also ‚Äòsongs of affliction‚Äô in which the women speak of their loves, trials and tribulations as women. The Basotho women poets thus resemble the African-American female blues vocalists who also had artistic talent and were considered socially deviant at the time. Basotho men still deny the existence of female poets as traditionally, women were not seen as ‚Äòeloquent‚Äô or poets but as singers.‚Äô Male poets also insist that a true praise poet does not perform in taverns around inebriated people but in an area where the audience can concentrate and appreciate the rhythmic aspects of the poetry.David B.

It is Shelley's earliest known recording, and was created when he was in college. After developing an interest in electronic music, Shelley created a single electronic oscillator with an added potentiometer, and recorded the album on the device in his living room while utilising a two-track stereo recorder. The entirely electronic album is experimental in style, and emphasises oscillations and drone characteristics. Although recorded in 1974, Sky Yen went unreleased for six years until after Shelley had earned recognition in the punk rock band Buzzcocks. The album surprised fans expecting pop music, and received a hostile reception. More positive critical attention has greeted the record in retrospect, and in December 2011, it was re-released by Drag City as part of a series of reissues of the Groovy Records catalogue. Background and production While at college in the early 1970s, Shelley developed an interest in electronics. He would purchase magazines that contained diagrams of electronic devices buyers could create, one of which he later described as \\"a simple thing where you could get one of those etch resist pens and a sheet of plastic with copper on one side, and you could draw your circuit on this, then put it in an acid bath to dissolve the copper, except for the bits where you'd drawn this thing, and then you could solder your components in, and you ended up with this thing that made a siren noise.\\" Inspired by this, Shelley decided to experiment and create a homemade oscillator. He added a potentiometer, which he described as \\"a good resistor,\\" to the device so he could alter the pitch, and purchased a Tandberg two-track stereo recorder which allowed him to \\"do sound on sound by bouncing from one track to another.\\" He discovered that, by putting his fingers in the oscillator (which, running on a 9-volt battery, he did not deem a risk), he would \\"actually become part of the circuit,\\" explaining that the sound would be affected by the sweat on his fingers or \\"which bits you'd randomly touch\\", and thus creating \\"weird\\" tones. He later said: \\"I became another resistance, and so had a touch-sensitive way of coming up with really weird things.\\" Sky Yen was inspired by German bands like Tangerine Dream (pictured). Recorded on Shelley's purpose-built oscillator in March 1974, Sky Yen was Shelley's first known recording, and predates his time with punk rock band Buzzcocks, his best known project. He recorded the album on a Saturday morning utilising the inventive set-up he discovered with his oscillator; he later explained of the production: \\"I just wired it all up and started messing about, changing the speed and the pitch, and built up this thing.\\" He subsequently added echo and other effects until he reached the desired effect. The album was directly influenced by Tangerine Dream and Cluster. Shelley commented: \\"I used to listen to John Peel, he was always playing a whole side of Phaedra and stuff like that\\". Buzzcocks biographer Tony McGartland notes the album was recorded in Shelley's living room, and highlights the influence of krautrock bands like Kraftwerk, Can and Faust. James McMahon of The Quietus also highlights \\"shades of John Cage\\". Composition Marking Shelley's first foray into electronica, Sky Yen exemplifies Shelley's early taste for Germanic electronic music, and contains his home-made reel of electronic experiments, conducted on the musician's single oscillator as opposed to fully-fledged electronic instruments. The record features two 20-minute tracks, and is characterised by the usage of drones, oscillations and noise. Trouser Press describe Sky Yen as a primitive, electronic drone album, an opinion echoed by writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who also feels the album resembles kraturock. Writer John Kealy nonetheless notes: \\"It is hard truly pin it down as it never settles into the easy drones that many Kosmische groups often employ.\\" The album is fully instrumental, and the oscillations throughout the record are distorted and primitive in style. The music is aggressive in tone, and incorporates tones that feature for \\"longer than is comfortable\\" according to Kealy. The first half of Sky Yen features high-pitched waveforms, some of which hold for a lengthy period, forming a \\"relentless resonant backbone\\". The second half of the album was said by Kealy to have \\"more in common with air raid sirens than music.\\" Release and reception In the years after completing Sky Yen, Shelley would listen to it in headphones while lying in the dark and also play it to guests, describing it as \\"great at clearing parties.\\" However, despite being recorded in 1974, Sky Yen went unreleased until released by Groovy Records on 24 April 1980, the label he started with manager Richard Boone the previous year, for a limited edition release. The album's release came after Buzzcocks' control over the production of their music ensured Shelley could launch his own record label. According to Shelley, he would \\"[play] the tapes just for myself\\" until, when starting the label, thought, \\"Why not put this out?\\" By this point, there were already British and American bands called Sky, and as he \\"didn't care to make it three,\\" Shelley added \\"yen\\" to the proposed Sky name, the idea coming when he noticed he labelled the tapes with \\"a Japanese Dymo tape marker using the 'yen' symbol.\\" Released in a sky blue sleeve designed to resemble graph paper, Sky Yen was issued as the musician's first solo album, and its appearance in 1980 predated Shelley's return to electronic instruments when officially launching his solo career a year later. The record sold out its original run of 1,000 copies but puzzled fans of Buzzcocks. Shelly recalled that, upon release, Sky Yen \\"sold loads, because people were expecting it to be me singing pop songs and they weren't expecting this noise that came out.\\" In August 1980, Sounds magazine opened their negative review of the album with the words \\"Poor, Pete Shelley,\\" a reflection of the hostility the album received.  Retrospective reviews and legacy  Sky Yen has built up acclaim in the years since its release. Ged Babey of Louder Than War felt that Sky Yen was \\"hugely noncommercial\\" given Shelley's recognition as a pop lyricist in a punk band, and described it as \\"in a way his Metal Machine Music.\\" Though he felt the album's \\"[d]rones, oscillations and whale-noises\\" would test listeners' patience and \\"clear the room at any party successful,\\" he felt the record was \\"brave, uncompromising and fucked music which was way ahead of its time.\\" John Kealy of Brainwashed wrote that although Sky Yen is \\"a far cry from the short, choppy punk\\" Shelley is best known for, it is \\"just as engaging as his more famous efforts.\\" He felt that the album \\"cleansed [his ears] in a way rarely achieved by any medical intervention\\" and felt the album was suitable for \\"when I need to clear the cobwebs from my mind.\\" Jedd Beaudoin of PopMatters wrote that the album \\"sounds like a dentist's drill on an expressway to your skull whilst some sinister someone submerges your hand in ice cold water and a dancing clown appears to do birthday magic tricks for you.\\" He felt Sky Yen was a \\"real gem for the noise enthusiast,\\" but noted what he felt was the absence of \\"any true compositions across its two 20-minute tracks.\\" David Sprague of Spin commented that the \\"self-indulgent\\" album \\"sounded more like a mosquito dive-bombing a cheap tube amp than anything else.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album \\"a curiosity for devoted fans, especially since the primitive, droning electronics recall Krautrock, not punk rock.\\" KEXP-FM describe the album as \\"oscillating madness.\\" Trouser Press highlighted the simplistic production set-up and call the album \\"a collectors' item of minor interest.\\" Sam Adams of The A.V. Club felt the album's \\"side-long electronic drones\\" exemplified Shelley's experimental music background, which was later evident in Buzzcocks songs like \\"I Believe\\" and \\"(Moving Away from the) Pulsebeat.\\" Critic Dave Thompson described Shelley's oscillator experiments on the album as \\"sufficient\\", and counted the record alongside works by The Future, Cabaret Voltaire and Thomas Leer in that all \\"were all stepping out in one form or another and looking, too, towards an icy electronic future.\\" Sky Yen was re- released by Drag City on 6 December 2011 as part of the label's reissues of the full Groovy Records catalogue. The album also featured alongside other Groovy albums in Drag City's 2012 box set The Total Groovy.

He is people's deputy of Ukraine since November 2014. In 2012 he was sentenced to five years for robbery. Biography =Early years= Yevhen Deidei was born on 12 July 1987 in the small town of Reni, Odessa Oblast, which lies on the left bank of the Danube. His father, a deputy of the town council of Reni, Serhiy Yakovych Deidei, in 2011 he was convicted of fraud by the decision of Izmailsky District Court of Odessa Oblast. His mother - Ol πha Mykolayivna Deidei (n√©e Volkova), he has a brother Serhiy. In 2004, at the age of 17, he participated in protests during the \\"Orange Revolution\\" in Ukraine. Yevhen Deidei was convicted of robbery in 2012. The verdict was pronounced by the Suvorov district court of Odessa on 23 March 2012. Deidei received 5 years for robbery without confiscation of property. His accomplice Oleksiy Lyakhovol πskiy (later he became his assistant in Verkhovna Rada) received the same term of imprisonment - 5 years without confiscation of property. According to the court decision, Deidei acquired a hunting shotgun \\"TOZ\\" without any permit, later he sawed off the shoulder stock and barrel of the shotgun, which he kept with him without any legal rights. On 2 February 2011, Deidei and Lyakhovol πskiy made the first robbery attack on A. Trandasir and S. Trandasir on the 1st Student Lane in Odessa. They beat citizens and took their mobile phone and money. In the evening of the same day, Deidei and Lyakhovol πskiy attacked two men, A. Khmuryy and I. Sakal, at the corner of Krasnoslobodskaya Street and Yasha Gordienko Street. On the night of 3 February, near the house No. 3 along Ostrovsky Street, the criminals committed the third attack - on S. Syvoplyasov, D. Shevchuk and V. Rudkovs πka. Accomplices began to beat the men, when they were noticed by militsiya officers. Lyakhovol πskiy was arrested while trying to escape from the crime scene. On 11 February, after the opening of the criminal case, Deidei was also arrested. Deidei and Lyakhovol πskiy fully admitted their guilt in the above explained crimes. On 23 March 2012, Suvorov District Court of Odessa sentenced Yevhen Deidei and Oleksiy Lyakhovol πskiy for robbery to five years in prison without confiscating of property (with a delay of three years). According to the decision of the Liubashivka District Court of the Odessa Oblast of 6 April 2015, Lyakhovol πskiy was released from the punishment. From the end of 2013, Deidei began to hide from the authorities, but was not wanted. After the beginning of the protests in Ukraine, Yevhen Deidei became the Sotnik of the 7th Sotnia of ‚ÄúSelf-Defense of the Maidan‚Äù. =War in Donbass= Yevhen Deidei in 2014 with his then wife Inga. In 2014, Deidei became the coordinator of the battalion of the Special Tasks Patrol Police \\"Kiev-1\\" of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine in Kiev. In November 2014, he became a people's deputy of the 8th convocation of the Verkhovna Rada on the list of the \\"People's Front\\" party. In the same year, Yevhen Deidei became the coordinator of the battalion of the Special Tasks Patrol Police \\"Kiev-1\\" of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine in Kiev. On 10 September 2014, along with other commanders of volunteer battalions he was included in the Council of war of Ukraine during the congress of the party \\"People's Front\\". On 24 February 2015, the car in which Yevhen Deidei was driving was shot from an RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade launcher. This incident occurred in the area of Marinka, Donetsk Oblast. Deidei managed to escape from the scene of the shelling, along with two soldiers of the \\"Kiev-1\\" battalion, and get to the Kurakhove district department. On 14 July 2017, Deidei received a shrapnel wound of a foot with an 82-mm shell in Avdiivka. This was reported by his comrade-in-arms in the \\"Kiev-1\\" battalion. The Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine opened criminal proceedings. According to Ukrainian journalists, at the time when Yevhen Deidei was in Avdiivka, there was not recorded any heavy shelling. =Political life= During Euromaidan, Yevhen Deidei met a number of politicians who occupied or subsequently occupied high posts in the Ukrainian authorities - Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Arsen Avakov, and Oleksandr Turchynov. Deidei spoke about his decision to become a parliamentarian as follows: \\"I decided to go to the Verkhovna Rada because I saw people there [in Maidan Nezalezhnosti] who were different from those politicians who were there before us. [Previous politicians] did nothing, but robbery and theft. And I saw a perspective in these people, so I decided to follow them.\\" On 6 February 2015, a number of media published photos of correspondence between the deputy of the \\"People's Front\\" Oleksandr Kodola and Yevhen Deidei. The latter promised $1,500 for Kodola for \\"asking a question\\" to the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Vitaly Yarema, during his speech at the Verkhovna Rada. Kodola asked Yarema about the former First deputy prosecutor of the Pecherskyi District of Kiev and, at that time, the Prosecutor of the Prymorsky City District of Odessa, Oleksandr Kuz'menko, who opposed the Euromaidan activists. According to police sources, in 2015, Yevhen Deidei together with his wife Inga flew four times on a private charter plane AHO633J of Denys Dzenzers πkyy, whose assistant Ihor Linchevs πkyy loaned Inga Deidei UAH 3.5 million. Together with them, deputies Tetyana Donets π and Andriy Pavelko flew to Berlin and returned to Kiev from Paris, Cannes, and Budapest. During those flights, Yevhen Deidei and Dzenzers πkyy used diplomatic passports, which is strictly prohibited, since the purpose of their trip was leisure. In March 2016, the head of the largest Ukrainian gas producer UkrGasVydobuvannya Oleh Prokhorenko appealed to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office, and the National Police to investigate the activities of deputies Maxym Polyakov and Yevhen Deidei, who, according to Prokhorenko, puting pressure on the company. Deidei protested against the appointment of Andrey Tokar to the post of Director of logistics of UkrGasVydobuvannya due to the fact that he previously worked at the Saratov Oil Refinery in Russia: \\"How can such a strategic object as UkrGasVydobuvannya be under the leadership of Putin's lapdogs?! It can't be allowed to happen,\\" - Deidei wrote on his Facebook page on 3 March 2016. Yevhen Deidei also participated in a protest action close to the UkrGasVydobuvannya's Office, and he gave to the company management a letter with demanding to dismiss Tokar. UkrGasVydobuvannya's COO Oleksandr Romanyuk noted that such a position of the deputy frightens away foreign workers who speak Russian or English and have experience that Ukrainian citizens don't have. In July 2016, the Governor of Odessa Oblast and the third President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, accused Deidei of blocking the attraction of Latvian investments in the port of Reni on behalf of Arsen Avakov. Saakashvili also expressed outrage of Deidei‚Äôs criminal past: \\"A Latvian investor could invest ‚Ç¨6 million in the Reni port, several hundred Renians could get a job. This is a depressive port. But deputy Deidei, who was convicted four times, calls me and on behalf of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, says that the Latvians should not be allowed. What does the MIA have to do with the port of Reni? And why a four times convicted person is sitting in the parliament and allowing himself to call and discussing such topics with me?\\" In May 2017, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Yuriy Lutsenko, sent to the Verkhovna Rada a request for the removal of parliamentary immunity from Yevhen Deidei. He was suspected of violating Article 368-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (\\"illegal enrichment\\"). On 3 July, Lutsenko, during a meeting of the Rada's Regulatory Committee, showed recordings of telephone conversations about Inga Deidei's loan of UAH 3.5 million from businessman Ihor Linchevs πkyy. These records do not confirm the origin of the money through the loan. The materials of the Prosecutor's Office, sent in July 2017 to the Verkhovna Rada, stated the following: # According to the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine, from 1 June 2009 to 31 December 2016 Yevhen Deidei received a total income of UAH 241,883.3. # His ex-wife Inga Deidei from 14 September 2007 to 31 December 2016 received a total income of UAH 1,198,822.5. # Total income of the Deidei family was UAH 1,440,705.84. # In the declaration of Yevhen Deidei, it was stated that Inga had financial obligations to Ihor Linchevs πkyy in the amount of UAH 3.5 million. # During the pre-trial investigation, it was established that the loan agreement between Inga Deidei and Ihor Linchevs πkyy wasn't executed, and the money wasn't transferred. # With a total income of UAH 1,440,705.84, Yevhen Deidei officially indicated assets of UAH 6,133,690.95 - an apartment in Kiev worth UAH 2,893,993.06, two Audi Q7 cars (worth UAH 1,574,818.67 and UAH 1,664,879.22). On 1 November 2018, Yevhen Deidei was included in the Russian sanctions list in connection with Ukraine‚Äôs unfriendly actions towards citizens and legal entities of the Russian Federation. Awards *Order For Courage, 3rd class (2 August 2014). On 19 September 2018, a message appeared in the official government newspaper Uryadovy Kuryer, in which the Order For Courage (together with the order book) received by Deidei was declared lost. *Honorary weapon ‚Äì Glock-17 pistol (11 March 2015). * 25 Years of Independence of Ukraine Medal (19 August 2016). Earnings In 2013, Deidei didn't declare any income. He owned a 15-year-old Toyota Corolla, and his wife Inga had a 5-year-old Subaru Tribeca. In 2014, Inga Deidei, who earned UAH 14.5 thousand (USD 539) in a year, acquired a 2013 Chevrolet Camaro. On 18 and 19 October 2012, Inga purchased two apartments in Odessa - with an area of 43.2 and 76 square meters. Camaro was sold next year for UAH 700 thousand, instead of it two Audi Q7 were bought for a total of UAH 3.5 million. According to the declaration, the money came from a loan given to Inga. In 2015, Yevhen Deidei declared expenses in the amount of UAH 2,737 million for the construction of an apartment - without specifying the source of this money. In this regard, National Anti-Corruption Bureau opened criminal proceedings under article No. 368-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (\\"Illegal enrichment\\"). At the end of 2015, Yevhen Deidei declared USD 30 thousand in cash, and his former spouse - USD 41 thousand and UAH 350 thousand. At the same time, the deputy‚Äôs salary for 2015 was UAH 70.6 thousand, he also received UAH 80.5 thousand as compensation for the exercise of powers, as well as UAH 180 thousand as compensation for rental housing, while Inga Deidei earned UAH 39 thousand. Thus, Deidei paid UAH 15 thousand per month for renting an apartment of 137 square meters. According to an investigation of independent journalist Volodymyr Boyko, Yevhen Deidei owns a luxury car park, consisting of Infiniti FX35 (2009), Chevrolet Camaro (2012), Audi A7 (2011), Toyota Land Cruiser 200 (2013), Porsche Cayenne (2011), as well as the two above-mentioned Audi Q7 (2015).

It is one of several lists of U.S. pipeline accidents. See also list of natural gas and oil production accidents in the United States.   Incidents  * On January 11, personnel from Millennium Pipeline noticed that a gas transmission pipeline was leaking in Tioga County, New York. This 30-inch diameter pipeline was built in 2008. A pinhole in a rejected girth weld was found to be the cause of the failure. It appears that during the course of the construction project for the line, the subject pipe section was inadvertently picked up and subsequently installed in the pipeline. PHMSA ordered testing of this pipeline for similar flaws. * A 12-inch cast iron gas main leaking in Philadelphia exploded, killing a repair crew member and injuring six others on January 18. * Multiple gas pressure regulators failed, and caused a gas pressure surge in Fairport Harbor, Ohio, on January 24, causing gas fires in 11 houses, and one apartment. 150 gas appliances were damaged or destroyed, but there were no injuries. Gas company Dominion East Ohio says it found fluids and debris in a failed regulator. A year after the explosion, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio recommended a $500,000 fine for Dominion. * Five people were killed, and eight houses were destroyed, in a gas explosion and fire in Allentown, Pennsylvania on February 9. The NTSB had warned UGI about cast iron gas mains needing replacement after the 1990 gas explosion in that city. Between 1976 and the date of the letter, July 10, 1992, two more gas explosions occurred. Three people were killed, 23 injured and 11 houses were destroyed or damaged in those explosions. UGI was cited in 2012 for several safety violations, including a lack of valves on their gas system. * Late on February 10, a Tennessee Gas Pipeline 36-inch gas transmission pipeline exploded and burned near Lisbon, Ohio. No injuries resulted. The cause was from stress on a girth weld on the pipeline. A failure on another girth weld on the pipeline system led to a PHMSA Consent Agreement. * Early on February 24, a pipeline near Texas City, Texas ruptured, sending up to of gasoline into Bayou Pierre. * On March 1, a Tennessee Gas Pipeline gas transmission pipeline failed near Cumberland, Ohio. A material or weld defect was the cause. * Early on March 17, a 20-inch steel CenterPoint Energy natural gas line running through a Minneapolis, Minnesota neighborhood ruptured, and gas from it ignited, caused evacuations to buildings nearby, and Interstate 35W was closed from downtown Minneapolis to Highway 62. There were no injuries. The Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety later found the pipe there was not designed to handle the load of soil and passing cars, and efforts to shore up the pipeline were incorrectly carried out. * A farmer and rancher near White Oak Township, Michigan smelled gasoline on April 13, and discovered gasoline from a products pipeline leaking into a drainage ditch. As of late September, an estimated 460,000 gallons of gasoline had been released, with about 111,000 gallons of it recovered. * On May 7, a threaded connection failed on a Keystone Pipeline pump at a station in Sargent County, North Dakota, spilling about 400 barrels of crude oil. Due to a number of other leaks on this pipeline system, Keystone's owner, TransCanada Corporation, was given a Corrective Action Order by PHMSA. * An 8-inch NGL pipeline failed in Romeoville, Illinois on May 14, leaking about 4200 gallons of butane. Corrosion inside a casing under a road was the cause of the failure. Corrosion only 2.5 feet from the failure had been seen by a smart pig run in 2007, but was not within action limits at the time. * On May 19, a 10-inch crude oil pipeline ruptured near Maysville, Oklahoma. Over of crude were lost. There was no fire. Internal pipeline corrosion was the cause. * A 2-inch lateral on a crude oil pipeline rupture in Huntington Beach, California on July 1. A major road, Goldenwest Street, had to be closed for cleaning and pipeline repairs. * Late on July 1, a 12-inch Exxon Mobil crude oil pipeline. also known as the Silvertip Pipeline, ruptured, and spilled about 63,000 gallons of oil into the Yellowstone River in south-central Montana. There was confusion in the pipeline control room, causing a delayed pipeline shutdown. Some residents of Laurel, Montana had to be evacuated. The break near Billings fouled the riverbank and forced municipalities and irrigation districts to close intakes. Exxon later increased the spill size estimate to 1500 barrels in January 2012 after seeing the damage to the pipeline. About 140 people were evacuated starting about 12:15 a.m. Saturday due to concerns about possible explosions and the overpowering fumes. All were allowed to return after instruments showed petroleum odors had decreased, although no information was available regarding the concentrations of benzene in air. Speculation involves high water flow in the Yellowstone River may have scoured the river bed and exposed the pipe. Consequently, with three oil refineries located in the Billings area, the fire chief for the city of Laurel said he asked all three to turn off the flow of oil in their pipelines under the river after the leak was reported. Exxon Mobil and Cenex Harvest Refinery did so, and Conoco Phillips said that its pipe was already shutdown. Cenex had a release into the Yellowstone River in September 2002. Exxon Mobil later announced the cleanup would cost $135 million. In 2015, Exxon Mobil was fined $1 million by PHMSA for this incident. * On July 20, a six-month-old, 30-inch natural gas pipeline exploded near Gillette, Wyoming, creating a crater. There was no fire, nor any injuries. Construction or installation issues caused the failure. * A pipeline carrying jet fuel ruptured in Mango, Florida on July 22. About of fuel spilled. There was no fire or injuries. * On August 13, an 8-inch NGL pipeline ruptured near Onawa, Iowa at a Missouri River crossing, during flooding conditions. About 818 barrels of Natural Gasoline was lost. There were no evacuations or injuries, but two other pipelines in the same right of way were forced to shut down. * On August 17, Kinder Morgan's Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America had a flash fire and explosion at a plant south of Herscher, Illinois. Five employees went to the hospital. Kinder Morgan was later cited for pipeline and workplace safety violations. * A pipeline carrying heating oil was hit by construction workers in East Providence, Rhode Island on August 31, spraying oil on roofs, trees, and pavement, and flowed into storm drains. At least of oil were spilled. * A Cupertino, California condominium was gutted August 31, after a plastic pipeline fitting cracked, filling the garage with natural gas that exploded just minutes after the owner left for lunch. PG&E; later found six other plastic pipe failures near the blast site. The line was an especially problematic type of pipe manufactured by DuPont called Aldyl-A. PG&E; has of the early-1970s-vintage pipe in its system. Federal regulators singled out pre-1973 Aldyl-A starting in 2002 as being at risk of failing because of premature cracking. Explosions caused by failed Aldyl-A and other types of plastic pipe have killed more than 50 people in the United States since 1971, the federal government says. * In September, a 12.75 inch crude oil pipeline developed a leak under the Red River, in Temple, Oklahoma. * A 10-inch LPG pipeline failed on September 8, in Mitchell County, Texas. The escaping gas ignited, starting a small brush fire. The cause of the failure was a crack in the weld of a repair sleeve from bending and heat hardening. About 546,000 gallons of LPG burned. There were no injuries.https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/hse/article/17258125/west-texas- lpg-pipeline-explodes-in-milford-tex * On September 18, a house explosion and fire in Dallas, Texas was caused by a leaking gas main. 3 people were injured. * On September 20, a farmer, digging to lay drainage tile, hit a 10-inch gasoline pipeline, near Aurelius, New York, spilling about of gasoline. There was no fire or injuries. * A 2-inch crude oil gathering pipeline failed in Oklahoma on October 12, spilling about 120 barrels of oil. There were no injuries or fire from the failure. * Early on November 3, an explosion and fire hit a gas Columbia Gas Transmission pipeline compressor station at Artemas in Mann Township, Bedford County, Pennsylvania. There were no injuries. The cause was internal corrosion. * On November 8, a contractor for Vectren Corp. working on a bare gas main replacement project broke a \\"short stub\\" on the main, then failed to notify New Albany, Indiana authorities about the leak. Gas migrated through the soil, and built up in a nearby house, then exploded. Five people had to be hospitalized. * A crew working on a waterline hit a gas distribution pipeline in Fairborn, Ohio on November 12, leading to a gas explosion that killed one man, and injured five others, including children. * On the evening of November 13, 2011, a release of nearly 1798,000 gallons of diesel fuel occurred at the Belle Fourche Pipeline Company‚Äôs Davis Station in a remote area of Wyoming. The cause was from pumping against a closed valve on the pipeline. * On November 16, a Tennessee Gas Pipeline 36-inch gas transmission pipeline exploded and burned near Glouster, Ohio. Two people were injured, with three houses and a barn destroyed, and another barn damaged. The pipeline failed at a girth weld, with landsliding causing more stress on the weld. * Late on November 21, a Tennessee Gas Pipeline 24-inch gas transmission pipeline exploded and burned near Batesville, Mississippi. Twenty houses were evacuated for a time, but there were no injuries or major property damage. The pipeline failed at a sleeve over a wrinkle bend installed in 1946. * On December 3, a Williams Companies gas transmission pipeline exploded and burned in Marengo County, Alabama. A 47-foot section of the pipe was hurled more than 200 feet from the failure area. The gas burned for several hours, and a nearby pipeline was damaged. There were no injuries, or serious property damage. External corrosion was the cause of the failure, due to issues with the pipeline coating, the cathodic protection level, and the local soil corrosiveness. * On December 6, explosions and fire erupted at a natural gas pipeline compressor station in Sublette County, Wyoming. Two workers were injured. * On December 10, a landowner using a bulldozer hit an 8-inch and a 12-inch petroleum pipelines near Nemaha, Nebraska, rupturing both lines. The spill size was estimated to be 119,000 gallons of gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel. Some of the fuel flowed into a creek leading into Jasper Creek. There were questions about the depth of soil coverage for this pipeline. * A 42-inch natural gas transmission pipeline failed and ignited at a valve on December 10 in Cache County, Utah. * On December 27, controllers for Enterprise Pipeline received an alarm, for a leak on an LPG pipeline. The leak location was found in Loving County, Texas. Repair crew excavated the area, and found a full girth weld failure. During the pipeline repair, a flash fire involving residual pipeline product in the soil occurred, injuring 3 employees, one of whom required in-patient hospitalization. The rupture was attributed to the complete circumferential separation of an acetylene girth weld dating to 1928, and the flash fire was attributed to operator error.

Keen received the 2005 Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the Society for Research in Child Development, and the 2018 Distinguished Contribution Award from the International Congress on Infant Studies. Keen received an Honorary degree from Uppsala University in 2009 and was honored by the Federation of Associations in Behavioral & Brain Sciences. She received the 2011 Award for Distinguished Service to Psychological Science from the American Psychological Association (APA). Before 2002, she published under the name Rachel Keen Clifton.  Biography  Keen received her B.A in Master of Arts from Berea College in 1959. She continued her education at the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota, where she completed her Ph.D in 1963, under the supervision of Harold W. Stevenson. Her dissertation used a non-nutritive sucking paradigm to study discrimination and habituation to tones in newborn infants. Keen was awarded an NICHD postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Wisconsin to continue her studies of newborn behavior using psychophysiological measures. While at the University of Wisconsin, she studied infant development under the supervision of Frances K. Graham. Their collaborative work explored attention in newborn infants, using heart rate activity as an indicator of habituation. Keen was a long-standing member of the faculty at the University of Massachusetts (1968-2007) prior to joining the faculty of the University of Virginia in 2007. Her research career was supported by a Research Scientist Award from NIMH (1981-2001), and a MERIT award from NICHD (1999-2009). Her awards include the Distinguished Alumna Award from Berea College, and the Distinguished Faculty Award from the University of Massachusetts. Keen was awarded membership to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and is a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science, the Acoustical Society of America, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Psychological Association.  Research  Keen is known for pioneering scientific studies of infant cognition, with many of her experiments using habituation to study infants' developing perception and cognition. One of her most significant discoveries was that newborns remained habituated to auditory stimuli even after a delay of 24 hours. She replicated the findings years later using speech stimuli and behavioral responses. Her work suggested that long-term memory is well established in newborns, which was novel idea in 1965. Keen and her colleagues also performed research on how premature newborns (gestational age 28 weeks to 32 weeks) reacted to painful stimulation (physiological and behavioral responses to heel-sticks). By observing facial expressions, cardiac reactions and movement durations, it was determined that the preterm newborns learned to anticipate the painful stimulus. Some of her research on psychoacoustics focused on the auditory precedence effect. The auditory precedence effect refers to the judgment of a direction of a sound source, which depends on spatial information (i.e., where the sound is coming from). When two sounds are closely space in time, people often hear them as fused, and perceive them as coming from the direction of the first sound. Keen's research indicated that the auditory precedence effect was not present in two-month-old babies but was evident in older babies (four- to six-month-olds). One line of Keen's research focused on how infants and young children solve problems. In a series of clever studies, Keen and colleagues explored problem solving by asking infants to grip various sound-emitting objects in the dark. By contrasting how infants solved problems in different lighting conditions, Keen was able to determine the extent to which infants were relying on vision to solve problems. These studies also demonstrated the infant's mental preparation to grasp objects varying in size even when the objects were no longer visible in the dark. Keen and her colleagues also looked at how infants adjusted their grips in preparation to use different tools. They found that by 14 months of age, infants were using different grips for different tools and action plans, suggesting that they were capable of planning in relation to a goal. Another one of her studies explored how instructions to visualize an event helped three-year-old children solve spatial problems. This study indicated that three-year-olds could use their imagination to help them to solve difficult problems.  Representative Publications  * Clifton, R. K. (1974).

The town was located just east of Sweeden, or about north-northeast of the county seat of Brownsville. It was once a referred to as a ‚Äúcompany town‚Äù along the Nolin River during much of the first half of the 20th century, but the industrial town no longer exists. It was disincorporated in 1957 after the closure of the company that operated it. Kyrock was one of several other central Edmonson County communities located near Mammoth Cave National Park. History =Kentucky Rock Asphalt Company= In 1918, the town was incorporated into a town that was built by the Kentucky Rock Asphalt Company, which the town's name, Kyrock, is derived from. During the company's heyday in the 1920s, the company mined, processed, and shipped hundreds of tons of rock asphalt, by way of both the Nolin and Green Rivers. This was done to eventually pave roadways in areas where they were not previously served by minor or major roadways at the time. The company itself began operations in 1917 after a merger between two companies involved in rock mining and paving. Eight new quarries and a processing facility, which ended up becoming a vital part of the county's history, opened at the site that would become part of the town, which was incorporated in 1918. The material generated by the company, made of silica sand, was the first material ever laid for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The asphalt rock from Kyrock was also used to pave the streets of major cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Havana, Cuba.Minor, Robyn L. (July 3, 2008). ‚ÄúKyrock may be on a roll‚Äù. Bowling Green Daily News. Retrieved September 25, 2018. The company stayed open for a total of forty years with its heavy promotions and advertising, becoming the state's most successful asphalt mine during that period. Higher costs to pave with asphalt resulted in the end of the company since petroleum-based asphalt was a lower-cost method of paving. The Kentucky Rock Asphalt Company was shut down in 1957. The town itself was unincorporated at some point in the late 1950s. Kyrock's post office operated from 1920 to 1955. =Education= Kyrock High School, which was established in 1937, merged into the county's other high schools in 1959 to form the Edmonson County High School in Brownsville. Kyrock Elementary School is the sole educational institution, housing students from kindergarten to fourth grade, from all of the northern half of the county since the 1959-60 school year. =Transportation= In addition to the Nolin River, Kyrock was also served with a ferry that connected the town to Whistle Mountain, and eventually to areas along what is now KY 728 into the northeastern portion of the county. Ferry service was discontinued a few years before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers impounded Nolin River to build Nolin Dam in 1963. Today, Kyrock is nothing more than an unincorporated community along a county- maintained road off State Highway 259 (KY 259) near Sweeden. Kyrock Road is accessible from both KY 259 from Brownsville and KY 728 from the Nolin Lake area.

She is a Professor of Educational Psychology and Faculty Research Affiliate of the Population Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin. In 2007, Falbo received the Newman-Proshansky Career Achievement Award from the American Psychological Association (APA) (Division 34). This award is offered annually to recognize significant lifetime contributions to the fields of environmental and population psychology. Falbo is a Fellow of APA Division 9, Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, and APA Division 35, Society for the Psychology of Women. She has served terms as President of the Society for Environmental, Population and Conservation Psychology (APA Division 34) and the Southwestern Psychological Association. Falbo and Harriett Romo co-authored the book Latino high school graduation: Defying the odds. Falbo is editor of the volume The Single-Child Family.  Biography  Falbo received her B.A. degree in Psychology at George Washington University in 1968. She received her M.A degree in psychology and PhD in Social Psychology at University of California, Los Angeles in 1969 and 1973, respectively. Falbo early work examined kindergarten children's attributions about academic achievement. After holding positions at California State University, Long Beach and Wake Forest University, Falbo joined the faculty of Educational Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin in 1976. Falbo began studying the development of only children in the 1970s. She was drawn to this topic as an only child and the mother of an only child. Her research has been funded through the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Ford Foundation, and the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health.  Research  Much of Falbo's research has focused on the psychological and social outcomes of small families, with an emphasis on sibling status effects on children's development and educational attainment. Other widely cited research has examined power dynamics and strategies in interpersonal relationships and parental strategies associated with high school students' success. Falbo conducted extensive research examining effects of China's one- child policy on the personalities of Chinese children and adults. Falbo aimed to determine whether China's one-child policy influenced children's academic, physical, social, and personality traits. In a synthesis of 22 studies of psychopathology among Chinese only children, Falbo and her colleague Sophia Hooper reported that only children felt more pressure and dealt with higher expectations from their parents than their peers with siblings. Falbo and her colleague Denise Polit conducted a series of meta-analyses of over 100 studies of only children that considered developmental outcomes in adjustment, character, sociability, achievement, and intelligence. The studies included in the meta-analyses were mainly from the U.S. and Canada, yet were diverse with respect to socioeconomic class and race/ethnicity. The authors found no evidence in support of the stereotype that only children are lonely, selfish, and maladjusted. Rather, only children tended to score higher on tests of verbal ability and intelligence than children with siblings (with the exception of firstborns who scored comparably to only children). Only children and firstborns also showed higher achievement (i.e., academic performance, educational attainment, occupational prestige) than children with older siblings. Falbo also found that only children surpassed children in large families in the quality of their relationships with parents. Other work, which including children from China as well as the U.S., indicate advantages of older children with regards to character development (autonomy, maturity, leadership). Another study examined whether the presence of siblings promoted health over the lifespan. Falbo and her colleagues examined the health status of a large sample middle age adults from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. Using data from almost 4000 individuals (high school graduates of the class of 1957), the researchers found no effect of sibling status on health outcomes. Instead, they found evidence that better health was associated with having higher educational attainment and higher socioeconomic status.

Smartphones or tablets are used to play the game via a companion app, which connects to the PlayStation 4 through the host Wi-Fi network.  Gameplay  Knowledge is Power is a fastest finger trivia game for 2-6 players where players use their smart devices as game controllers. Set in a fictional stop-motion animated game show, players choose from eight puppet characters, which they personalize with a selfie and battle it out to become the first to the top of the \\"Pyramid of Knowledge\\". An image processing technique called \\"Generalized Generative Genitals\\" prevents the uploading of lewd photos. Each play-through consists of three battle rounds, two challenge rounds and a finale. The battle rounds consist of three multiple choice trivia questions. Players vote for each question's topic - the opener from a selection of four general knowledge categories ‚Äì and subsequent ones from a selection of categories related to the subject matter of the previous question. In this way, each play-through is unique, with the subject matter determined by player consensus. The challenge rounds consist of one linking challenge ‚Äì connecting related facts such as sports teams to their corresponding cities ‚Äì and one sorting challenge ‚Äì grouping sets of answers under two categories such as Harry Potter spell or Music Artist. The finale is a fastest finger general knowledge quiz played out at the pinnacle of a stepped pyramid, in which the objective is to be the first to the top. Each step is attributed a Power Play and players' starting positions are staggered by their points totals entering the finale. The winner is presented with a \\"scroll of knowledge\\", an obscure fact sent to their smartphone. Integral to Knowledge Is Power is a 'Power Play' system, with which, prior to every question, players can select either a strategic advantage for themselves, for example removing potential wrong answers from their answering screen, or to send a prank to an opponent's screen to potentially hinder their ability to answer the question. For example, ‚ÄòFreeze‚Äô encases the chosen target's answers in ice, and the recipient is forced to repeatedly tap their screens to free the answers before one can be submitted.  Reception  Knowledge is Power received a Metacritic rating of 71%. It was generally praised for its aesthetic and use of PlayLink technology. Liam Martin for the Daily Express states \\"the colourful presentation, silly characters and claymation art style screams fun, and the smartphone controls are more suited to non gamers\\", but goes on to criticise the game's pacing \\"it's just a shame there's not enough actual quizzing going on\\". Similarly, Sam Brooke, in his review for Push Square called Knowledge Is Power \\"a solid, fun quiz game for when you've got friends or family around\\" but \\"there's too much waiting... and not enough actual quizzing going on\\". Tyler Robertson for Hardcore Gamer writes \\"Knowledge Is Power is a classic trivia game with a wide breadth of topics... it has some quirks, but ... is a fun game that will get you and your friends fighting for the title of \\"Master of Useless Facts\\"\\". Knowledge is Power was nominated for Best Casual Game at The Independent Game Developers' Association Awards, and for Best Family/Social Game at the Titanium Awards. Developed by key members of the team behind Relentless Software's BAFTA-winning Buzz! quiz franchise, Knowledge is Power has been described as its 'spiritual successor'.

Her research expertise and interests are in the field of quantum foundations and quantum information. In particular, Romero is an experimental quantum physicist studying the properties of single photons for the development of new quantum alphabets and the nature of quantum causality.  Education  Romero attended Philippine Science High School where she enjoyed physics the most out of her subjects. She completed a Bachelor of Science (Applied Physics) at the University of the Philippines in 2005. Following this she then completed her Masters in Physics in 2007 also at the University of the Philippines as a Philippine Council for Advanced Science and Technology Research and Development (PCASTRD) Scholar. Her Master's thesis was focussed on manipulating the shape of light for microscopy and microfabrication by using spatial light modulators (SLMs). Romero then left the Philippines and moved to the UK to do a PhD with Miles J. Padgett and Stephen Barnett at the University of Glasgow. Her PhD thesis explored the experimental and theoretical aspects of entanglement of spatial modes related to optical orbital angular momentum, extending the use of SLMs for the manipulation of single photons.  Career and research  Following her PhD, Romero worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Glasgow. During this time, Romero and her colleagues made headlines with their discovery of a way to slow down photons in free space. In 2015 she moved to Brisbane, Australia as a research fellow in the School of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Queensland. In 2016, Romero was awarded a Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA) to continue her work on quantum foundations and single photon manipulation, specifically studying security in higher-dimensional quantum systems. Romero's work on quantum alphabets seeks to increase the amount of information encoded in a single photon, as opposed to only two options (0 and 1) for encoding in classical computing. This research has implications for cyber security and more efficient data transfer and storage. Romero is also currently developing a brain-inspired computer based on current quantum photonic capabilities to provide insight for both neuroscience and computing. = Honours = * 2019 Westpac Research Fellow *2019 L‚ÄôOr√©al-UNESCO For Women in Science program International Rising Talent Prize *2018 Ruby Payne-Scott medal from the Australian Institute of Physics *2018 UQ Early Career Researcher Award for Photonic neuromorphic computing *2018 Queensland Young Tall Poppy Award * 2018 Japan Society for the Promotion of Science HOPE Fellowship *2017 L‚ÄôOreal-UNESCO For Women In Science Fellowship * 2016 Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA) = Advocacy = Romero has been an advocate for women in science, emphasising the importance of role models for young women interested in physics.

Founded in 1996, Fireball was once the leading search engine in Germany, but quickly declined after being taken over by Lycos Europe and the rise of Google. In 2016, Fireball was re-established as an independent company and relaunched.  History  Fireball was originally called Flipper and started as a project of the faculty of computer science at the Technical University of Berlin built by Oli Kai Paulus, Helmut Hoffer von Ankershoffen born Oertelhttps://www.alumni.tu- berlin.de/angebote/gruender/gruendergalerie/gruenderprofile/neofonie00/, Nurhan Yildirim and Benhui Chen as contract work for Gruner + Jahrhttp://archiv.pressestelle.tu-berlin.de/pi/1997/pi143.htm, one of Germany's largest publishing houses. It was renamed to Fireball in 1997. The same year, T-Online chose Fireball as its search engine. Fireball quickly rose in popularity and became one of the largest search engines in Germany. By 1998, it was considered market-leader in the countryBodo Thielmann: Strategisches Innovations-Management in konvergierenden M√§rkten: Medien- und Telekommunikationsunternehmen in Online-Diensten und im digitalen Fernsehen, Springer, 2013; p. 176 and launched an e-mail service called Firemail and a news search engine called Paperball. Fireball was mostly focused on German- language results, for international search results it used AltaVista. In March 2000 Fireball was taken over by Lycos Europe. Under the ownership of Lycos, development of Fireball slowed. The takeover by Lycos as well as the rise of Google caused Fireball to massively lose market-share within a short time. By mid-2000, Fireball's market share had dropped to 22% and further eroded to 10% in 2001. Despite several attempts to relaunch the service, its market share continued to decline to 2.5% in 2002 and only 0.3% in 2005. In 2002, Fireball ceased to be an independent company and was run directly by Lycos Europe. In 2009, Lycos Europe was dissolved and Fireball was sold to Swiss company Ambrosia AG, which run the service until 2016. In 2016, Fireball was again sold, this time to a group of investors from Munich who re-established Fireball as an independent company. A completely overhauled version of the service, with a strong focus on privacy, was launched the same year. Search results are nowadays mostly based on Bing.

Plot The film depicts a 17-minute-long journey on a balloon as it ascends and finally rises into the clouds. Lennon and Ono appear at the start of the film dressed in dark cloaks and hoods. Production The film's directors Yoko Ono and John Lennon in 1969 The film was shot in the village of Lavenham in Suffolk in eastern England; the couple had decided to reject footage from an earlier filming attempt in the Hampshire town of Basingstoke. Lennon and Ono arrived at Lavenham's Market Place in their white Rolls-Royce driven by a chauffeur, and booked into the nearby Bull Hotel in Long Melford as 'Mr and Mrs Smith'. The couple were accompanied by a film crew who were shooting a documentary for the BBC, The World of John and Yoko, which was broadcast over the Christmas period of 1969. A local building company, W A Deacon & Sons, erected scaffolding to secure the balloon before release. The workers also helped lift Lennon and Ono into and out of the basket. A photograph of Lennon and Ono in the balloon was on the front cover of the East Anglian Daily Times on the following Monday. The couple left the basket shortly before the launch of the balloon, causing members of the public who had gathered to heckle them. Nic Kowland, a frequent technical collaborator on films made by Ono, helped with the technical aspects of the film. The idea for the film came from discussions the couple had had while making their album cover for Two Virgins while nude. The of gas that filled the balloon cost ¬£350, and permission for the flight was granted by the Ministry of Defence and Lavenham Parish Council. The parish council had been contacted by the Beatles' company Apple Corps two days prior to the shoot to ask permission to shoot the film. In a 2010 interview Ono said that making the film in Lavenham was \\"truly lovely\\" and that she would \\"love to go back there ... but it's not the same for me without John\\". The couple had previously directed the films Rape and Fly and subsequently collaborated on Up Your Legs Forever. Reception In 1972 the critic Jonas Mekas described the point at which the camera rose above the clouds as: \\"suddenly the cloud landscape opened up like a huge poem, you could see the tops of the clouds, all beautifully enveloped by sun, stretching into infinity...\\" The film was shown at the 1970 Cannes Film Festival. It was also shown at the Tate Britain exhibition A Century of Artists' Film in Britain between 19 May 2003 and 18 April 2004.

In early 929, King Henry led a campaign along his realm's eastern frontier against a multitude of Slavic forts. After capturing his first target at Brandenburg, he seized several more Slavic forts in the area and constructed German ones to establish and secure German control over the territory. A powerful Glomacze fort at Gana near modern-day Stauchitz was Henry's second primary target of the campaign. Henry's army took the fort after expending at least 110,000 man- hours of labour filling in a section of the ditch that protected it. Upon conquest of the stronghold, the Glomacze garrison was exterminated on Henry's orders and the young boys and girls in the fort were enslaved to Henry's milites professional soldiers. The siege and the subsequent establishment of a German fort at Meissen guaranteed permanent German dominance along the middle Elbe river and led to the creation of the Marca Geronis to maintain the conquests. The siege at Gana, combined with the large number of sieges in the rest of Henry's 929 campaign, show the considerable resources that could be mobilized by the German kingdom for extended warfare to conquer, control and annex territory. Background In the winter of 928, King Henry the Fowler of Germany organized a military expedition along his eastern frontier against various Slavic fortifications. His first objective was the Hevelli tribe's princely seat Brandenburg, located along the Havel river. The Germans reduced Hevelli military power through a multitude of battles, before closing in on the Brandenburg fortress and capturing it by a storm. Upon occupation of the fort, Henry proceeded to take over all of Hevelli territory. The next German campaign target was the Glomacze fortress of Gana near the Jahna river. On their way to Gana, Henry's army marched along the Plane valley to the Fl√§ming hills, conquering more Slavic forts at Belzig, M√∂rz, Niemegk and Zahna. Nearby, German forts were constructed in 929 at Strehla, controlling a ford over the Elbe, at Osterburg and at Dahlen, securing the area. Siege Archaeological excavations have uncovered a fortress in the Jahna river valley near Stauchitz that may be identified with the Gana site. The fort had walls 15 meters thick at their foundation and with a height of 6 meters. It was enclosed by a 15-meter wide and 5-meter tall ditch. The circuit of the walls was 700 meters long and the fort encompassed an area of 4 hectares, not including a possible outer fort. Filling in a 200-meter section of the ditch was necessary for Henry's men to storm the walls, a process that would have required the excavation of 15,000 tons of earth with at least 50,000 man-hours of work. The earth then needed to be transported and unloaded on the ditch using wagons. At least 750 carts and 30,000 wagon-loads of earth would have been needed, requiring another 60,000 man-hours of loading, transport and unloading. With only 8 hours of daylight in the winter, it would have taken 1,000 men two weeks to accomplish the task. Once Gana was stormed at the end of the 20-day siege, Henry gave the order for his men to kill all the defenders and enslave the young boys and girls to his milites professional soldiers. Given the ferocity of the German conquest, it is likely they had sustained heavy losses in the assault. Bachrach estimates more than 1,000 Germans killed or wounded, based on a mathematical siege attack model for the Brandenburg fortification. Aftermath After conquering Gana, Henry marched up the Elbe to accomplish his ultimate campaign aim, the siege of Prague and the subjugation of Duke Wenceslaus I's Duchy of Bohemia. Along the way, he constructed a fortress at Meissen, as proven by dendrochronological dating of the wooden construction at Meissen, which establishes an early building stage for 929. Meissen secured German control over the middle Elbe and was followed by the establishment of the Marca Geronis to maintain the German hold. With the help of Duke Arnulf of Bavaria's troops, Henry invaded Bohemia with a total force of 12,000‚Äì15,000 professional soldiers and expeditionary militia levies and compelled the surrender of heavily-fortified Prague, concluding a highly successful campaign. =Analysis= The extensive and successful German siege operations over some period of time show that Henry and the German kingdom could mobilize thousands of soldiers and supply them with the transport animals, food and fodder necessary to maintain them.

Personal life  Doolan was born and raised in the West End, Cincinnati, Ohio and graduated from St. Xavier High School in 1935. After Doolan returned from the war he married Dolores Doolan and completed a Bachelor's Degree in civil engineering. In March 2017, Doolan celebrated his 100th birthday.  World War II  Doolan enlisted in the Army Air Corps in the summer of 1941, but washed out of pilot school and was instated at graduation as a second lieutenant navigator. Doolan was a member of the 326th Bomb Squadron, 92nd Bomb Group (H), in the 8th Air Force, achieving the rank of First Lieutenant at the end of his tour of duty. He took part in 12 combat missions from January to August 1943 when he was shot down on his 13th mission. = Captivity = After the failure of the 13th mission Doolan and another airman co/pilot Donald Elbert Weir spent 21 days attempting to escape back to England, with aid from the Dutch resistance before being captured and taken to a prison camp. Doolan recalled \\"The next day we were going to go into Belgium, and we got word that our pilot made it to France and was captured in or near Paris, the two gunners had made it into Belgium and were captured also. So there was a good chance our next safe house is compromised. And it was, Doolan and Weir were knocked unconscious one by one by the Gestapo as they entered the safe house door. A German Luffwaffe officer days later prevented them from being shot as spys, as they were in civilian clothes when captured after weeks on the run. He entered the holding cell in the finest uniform they had ever seen and ordered the Gestapo to hand them over to him for transport to a POW camp. There was honor between \\"Flyers\\". Bob did research and contacted the family of one of the German fighter pilots(he didn't survive the war) who escorted the B17 to its belly landing in a Dutch field\\" He spent two years in the Stalag Luft III prison camp which was made famous by the 1963 film The Great Escape. Doolan was evacuated from the camp with other POW's in January 1945 by the Germans to avoid the Soviet Red Army where they were marched and moved by train cars to a new camp at Moosburg, Germany. The Moosburg prison camp was liberated by General George Patton and Doolan returned to the United States in 1945.

Grippo is an American neuroscientist and health psychologist known for her research on stress, mood disorders, and cardiovascular disease. She is an Associate Professor of Psychology at Northern Illinois University. Grippo received the 2012 American Psychological Association Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Career Contribution to Psychology in the area of health psychology. Her award citation emphasized \\"her creative contributions in investigating the association between depression and cardiovascular disease in preclinical animal models... [that] advance understanding of the connections among depression, stress, and physical disease in humans.\\" In addition to her award-winning research program, Grippo writes popular articles to help people better understand themselves and their circumstances. Her article \\"Why Reveal Your Disability or ‚ÄòHidden Identity‚Äô at Work?\\" encourages people to remain open about their disabilities, such as dyslexia. She embraces the ideas of individuality and self assurance. She and her colleague Joseph Magiano write a column for Psychology Today titled The Wide Wide World of Psychology. Grippo's articles emphasize brain-body interactions, stress, and health issues.  Biography  Grippo grew up in Park Ridge, Illinois. She received her Bachelors of Science degree from Drake University in 1998. She went to graduate school at University of Iowa where she obtained an MA in 2000, and a PhD in Behavioral Neuroscience in 2003, under the supervision of Alan Kim Johnson. Her dissertation used a rodent model to explore neurobiological mechanisms associated with heart disease. After a one-year postdoctoral fellowship at Loyola University Medical Center (2003-2004), Grippo took a second postdoctoral position at the University of Illinois at Chicago (2004-2008). During her second postdoc, Grippo studied neuroendocrine functioning in relation to social behavior in prairie vole. Grippo joined the faculty of the Department of Psychology at Northern Illinois University in 2008. Her research has been supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health. She has served as Chair of the Women in Physiology Committee of the American Physiological Society.  Research  Grippo uses animal models to identify significant associations between stress, mood, and cardiovascular dysregulation. Several of her studies have used rats to explore how mood influences autonomic nervous system activity and immune response, and its potential impact on cardiovascular functioning. In one of her studies with Sprague‚àíDawley rats, exposure to unpredictable stress led to anhedonia, operationally defined as a reduction in the animal's intake of sucrose without any associated change in its intake of water and used as an indicator of depression in the animal model. Of potential clinical relevance, the researchers identified links between the occurrence of anhedonia and significant changes in levels of cytokine and stress hormones (e.g., corticosterone) in the rats' blood plasma. Grippo and her colleagues have also conducted research on social isolation in relation to anxiety and depression in prairie vole, and associated disturbances in neuroendocrine activation that may be of clinical importance for understanding cardiovascular complications associated with stress. One of her studies investigated the hypothesis that social and environmental stressors, including long term social isolation, may alter the expression of gap junction proteins, Connexin 43 and Connexin 45. These proteins, located in the heart, play an important role in cardiac rhythmicity and intercellular communication. In this study, socially isolated prairie voles exhibited depressive behavior as compared to a control group (living in pairs). Social isolation was also found to alter the expression of Connexin 43 in the left ventricle of the heart, thus elucidating possible cellular mechanisms underlying altered cardiac rhythmicity in response to stress. *  Representative publications  * Grippo, A.

Written by frontman Ian Anderson, it features a folk-rock style that characterizes the Songs from the Wood album. Inspired by English folk tradition, the song was named by Ian Anderson as one of his top Jethro Tull songs. The song has since received critical acclaim and was released as a single in New Zealand in 1977. Background \\"Songs from the Wood\\" was inspired by a book of English folk stories Ian Anderson had been given. He explained, \\"I wrote 'Songs From the Wood' based on elements of folklore and fantasy tales and traditions of the British rural environment. Our PR guy, Jo Lustig, had given me a book about English folklore as a Christmas present, and I thumbed through it and found lots of little interesting ideas and characters and stories and things that I decided to evolve into a series of songs.\\" The song starts off with a cappella vocals before the flute and acoustic guitars make their appearance. Afterward, the rest of the band comes in. Anderson promises in the lyrics, \\"Songs from the wood make you feel much better.\\" Anderson later reflected, \\"[The song] is quite a nice one, because it has a lot of carefully contrived harmonies which I sang myself in the studio.\\" When asked about the song in 2015, Anderson said, \\"This, the title song of our 1977 album, was unashamedly twee. It‚Äôs decorative folk rock. It openly extols the virtues of the countryside, and the values you want to impart through this to other people. I suppose it is country rock, but in the British sense. It‚Äôs all delivered with a fair amount of hefty music. There are big guitar riffs and a lot of flute as well. And it does get a little angry, but with a purpose.\\" He ranked the song as one of his top 10 Jethro Tull songs. Release \\"Songs from the Wood\\" was released as the title track on Jethro Tull's 1977 album, Songs from the Wood. An edited form of the song was later released as a single in New Zealand, backed with \\"Jack in the Green\\". The single did not chart. Reception The song was largely praised by music critics. Allmusic's Bruce Eder said that \\"the harmonizing on 'Songs From the Wood' fulfills the promise shown in some of the singing on Thick as a Brick.\\" New Musical Express called it \\"a great opener\\" and praised Anderson's singing. \\"Songs from the Wood\\" was ranked the third best Jethro Tull song by Rock - Das Gesamtwerk der gr√∂√üten Rock-Acts im Check.

She has worked with various populations including children at high risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), blind individuals, and preterm infants. She is currently a professor of psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. Iverson received the Chancellor's Distinguished Research Award from the University of Pittsburgh in 2007 for her work on autism. Iverson co- edited with Susan Goldin-Meadow the book The nature and functions of gesture in children‚Äôs communication. The book discusses how gesture and speech become intertwined over the course of development, and gesture development in clinical populations, such as individuals diagnosed with ASD.  Biography  Iverson attended Bryn Mawr College, where she received an A.B. in Psychology in 1991. Subsequently, Iverson attended the University of Chicago, where she earned an M.A. in Psychology in 1994, and a Ph.D. in Psychology in 1996, under the supervision of Susan Goldin-Meadow. Iverson's dissertation examined the spontaneous gestures of congenitally blind youth (9 to 18 year-olds) and compared them with the gestures of individuals with sight (half of whom were blindfolded during tasks). Iverson completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Indiana University (1997-1999), where she worked with Esther Thelen. She worked at University of Missouri from 1999-2003 before joining the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh in 2003. Iverson participates in the Baby Siblings Research Consortium, a multinational project involving research teams in the United States, Canada, Israel, and the United Kingdom that aims to identify behavioral and biological markers associated with ASD risk by studying infant siblings of children previously diagnosed with ASD. Research to date found that siblings with high genetic risk for ASD exhibited lower developmental functioning (i.e., higher rates of developmental delay) at 3 years of age than children at low risk, even when dataset excluded children who met ASD diagnostic criteria. Iverson's current research, funded by the National Institutes of Health, studies the development of walking and locomotor exploration in infants at high risk of being diagnosed with ASD, due to the presence of an older sibling with ASD. The study aims relate motor development to growth in infants' social communicative skills with caregivers from 6 to 36 months of age, and infants known to be at heightened risk for motor and communicative delays to infants at low risk.  Research  Iverson's early research explored the role of gesturing in communicative development in individuals who were blind from birth and aimed to answer the question of why people gesture. Iverson and Susan Goldin-Meadow tested two possibilities that were not mutually exclusive. First, speakers may gesture simply because they see others gesture, and learn from this model to move their hands as they talk. To test this, they studied spontaneous gestures in congenitally blind children and adolescents and a control group of sighted children and adolescents. Second, speakers may gesture because they understand that gestures can convey useful information to the listener. To test this, they examined whether speakers gestured even when talking to a listener known to be blind, and thus obviously unable to profit from information conveyed by gesture. The researchers found that gesturing did not depend on either a model or an observer and appeared to be essential to the speaking process itself. Their findings suggest that the gestures that accompany speech may reflect or even facilitate the thinking that underlies speaking. In a longitudinal study of children at ages 10 to 24 months old, Iverson and Goldin-Meadow examined how children's early gestures support their acquisition of first words and the transition to two-word speech. Using video-recordings of naturalistic observation of caregiver-child interaction, the researchers coded instances of speech or gesture, or a combination of the two. They found that children often referred to objects using gestures prior to acquiring the corresponding words. The child's identification of a referent through gesture both preceded and predicted their learning of its name. Iverson and Goldin-Meadow also found that children's use of a gesture in combination with a word (e.g., pointing at bird while saying \\"nap\\") predicted their subsequent production of two-word combinations, such as \\"bird nap\\", when the gesture provided information that supplemented the meaning of the word. These findings suggested that gestures and words are tightly linked in early communicative development. With Esther Thelen, Iverson explored how gestures and other body movements may serve as a foundation for language development. They found that hand and mouth are mutually activated by spontaneous hand/mouth reflexes in newborn infants. Further, by the time they are 16 to 18 months old, infants produce meaningful words and gesture combinations in synchrony. Building on work by David McNeill that views gesture and speech as generated by a unified system for communicating, Iverson traced the developmental origins of the gesture‚Äìspeech system through studies of vocal‚Äìmotor coordination. She and a colleague focused on 6- to 9-months infants and how certain gestures of the upper extremities might underlie the coordination of speech and gesture apparent in adults. They found associations between rhythmic movements of the arms (especially the right arm) and increased rates of babbling. The authors suggested that \\"When an infant is engaged in an intense bout of rhythmic limb activity, for example, the level of activation in the motor system may spill over into the vocal system and entrain its activity.\\" Thus, on account of manual control developing more rapidly than vocal articulation, voluntary limb movements may serve to help infants gain voluntary control over their vocalizations.

From the district government of L√ºchow-Dannenberg he was granted a tourist incentive of 100,000 euro. A delegation of Universal Records came to L√ºchow to prevent a name like The Rolling Stones Museum. Agreed was than to change the name into Rolling- Stones-Fan-Museum, which was later shortened to Stones Fan Museum. Schr√∂der also needed to place a portrait of himself in the front of the building to make clear that it was a fan initiative and not one of the Stones themselves. The museum shows part of Schr√∂der's collection, photos, paintings of a variety of artists among whom Ron Wood, posters, documents, musical instruments, golden records, puppets, pinball tables, a signed billiard table, a BMW Isetta, and many other objects. Next to that, an Irish pub and a podium for bands have been constructed. In the course of time, several tribute bands played here, as well as the unofficial Stone Blondie Chaplin, and Chris Jagger, the younger brother of band member Mick. The disputed urinals Stones- murals in L√ºchow Within a year after the opening, the urinals, designed by the female Dutch artist Meike van Schijndel, where subject to controversy when feminists judged them to be sexist. The urinals have the shape of red lips and are inspired by the logo of The Rolling Stones. Back in 1971, the logo was inspired by the mouth of Mick Jagger. In this design, the tongue is left away, which gives a mere womanly look. Founder Ulli Schr√∂der replied to the controversy with: \\"That's not a man's mouth or a woman's mouth, that's art. They were damned expensive and they're staying where they are and that‚Äôs final.\\"Huffington Post, Rolling Stone Mouth-Shaped Urinals Called Sexist, 2 February 2012 In 2012 Schr√∂der and artist Heino Jacobsen made a design of a mural painting of forty meters of length.

The revolt quickly spread throughout the Lower Congo and engulfed the country in disorder, beginning the Congo Crisis.  Background  Gendarmerie in L√©opoldville, 1959. Unlike the rest of the Force Publique, the gendarmerie remained mostly loyal during the mutiny. The Force Publique was long characterised by repressive police actions and entrenched racial segregation. With the exception of 10 adjutants appointed shortly before independence, no Congolese soldier was able to advance past the rank of sergeant. Many hoped that independence would result in immediate promotions and material gains, but were disappointed by Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba's slow pace of reform. The rank-and-file felt that the Congolese political class‚Äîparticularly ministers in the new government‚Äîwere enriching themselves while failing to improve the troops' situation. There was dissatisfaction that Lumumba had appointed an unpopular colonel, van Hoorebeke, to a high post in the Ministry of Defence, and the troops from √âquateur and southern Kasai were additionally upset that Jean Bolikango and Albert Kalonji were not included in the new government. Many of the soldiers were also fatigued from maintaining order during the elections and participating in independence celebrations. On 27 June the Lumumba Government established a committee to draft a Treaty of Friendship, Assistance, and Co-operation to be signed with Belgium. It stipulated that the Belgian civil servants in the Congo and the Belgian officers of the Force Publique would remain at their posts and receive compensation from the Belgian government. It also allowed for Belgian metropolitan troops to continue to garrison the bases of Kitona and Kamina until another agreement could arrange the installations' handover to the Congolese government. The text of the treaty was hurriedly finished and on 29 June the agreement was signed by Belgian Prime Minister Gaston Eyskens, Belgian Foreign Minister Pierre Wigny, Lumumba, and Congolese Minister of Foreign Affairs Justin Bomboko. Independence Day, 30 June 1960, was a Thursday. It was followed by a long weekend of festivities that occurred in relative calm across the country. In L√©opoldville, the capital, sporadic fighting took place between factions that were dissatisfied by the result of presidential election. On the morning of 4 July workers in Coquilhatville, the capital of √âquateur Province, began striking. The Force Publique was called into service and opened fire on the crowds, killing nine. The strikebreaking action was the last official undertaking of the Force before the mutiny began. That same day the Congolese cabinet convened to discuss reforming the national institutions. They resolved to establish a committee to examine reorganisation of the army, paying special attention to eliminating racial discrimination. Meanwhile, at Camp L√©opold II, the chief military installation in L√©opoldville, officers observed a high level of excitement among the Congolese ranks. One non-commissioned officer began telling his fellow soldiers that since the Congo was independent they were not required to adhere to the Belgians' orders. At 17:00 General √âmile Janssens, commander-in-chief of the Force Publique, arrived and personally demoted him. Three undisciplined soldiers were placed in a holding cell, though two were provisionally released to Secretary of State for National Defence Albert Nyembo, who was informed of the incident. In the evening Janssens heard on a radio broadcast of the government's intent to set up a committee to reorganise the army. He was outraged that he had not been consulted.  The mutiny  Force Publique troops on the streets of L√©opoldville during the mutiny On the morning of 5 July General Janssens, in response to increasing unrest among the Congolese ranks, summoned all troops on duty at Camp L√©opold II. He demanded that the army maintain its discipline and wrote \\"before independence = after independence\\" on a black board to emphasise that the situation would not change. That evening the Congolese sacked the canteen in protest of Janssens. He alerted the reserve garrison of Camp Hardy, 95 miles away in Thysville. The officers tried organise a convoy to send to Camp L√©opold II to restore order, but the men mutinied and seized the armoury. The \\"Congo Crisis\\" which followed would come to dominate the tenure of the Lumumba Government. The following morning some groups of soldiers drove from Thysville to Inkisi, Madimba, and Mbanza-Boma, spreading the mutiny and raping two women. Meanwhile, Janssens finalised plans to attack Camp Hardy and had alerted the commander of the Belgian metropolitan troops in the Congo. The government countermanded his order and instead dispatched Mobutu, Charles Kisolokele, and the Vice President of L√©opoldville Province to negotiate with the mutineers. They succeeded in releasing the captive Europeans and began evacuating them to the capital. Bands of angry soldiers roamed the capital, and Lumumba interrupted a cabinet meeting at his residence to invite one group to share its grievances. In an attempt to placate the mutinous troops, he dismissed Janssens and promoted every soldier by one grade. He also dismissed the Belgian officer in charge of the S√ªret√© and forced him into exile, precipitating a collapse of the organisation completed by the departure of most other Belgian personnel. In L√©opoldville, several Congolese soldiers had been convinced that Lumumba had brought Soviet troops into the country to disarm the Force Publique. Angered by this, they stormed the hotel rooms of the Soviet delegation (which had been present for the independence celebrations). Upon hearing what had occurred, Lumumba directed Bomboko to assume responsibility of the security of all foreign delegations present in the Congo and ensure that the Soviets could safely leave the country. Bomboko ordered Minister-Delegate to the United Nations Thomas Kanza to escort the delegation to N'djili Airport where they both convinced the Congolese soldiers to allow the Soviets to depart in peace. On 7 July formal negotiations between the mutineers and the government on the reorganisation of army began. A delegation of Congolese soldiers met with Lumumba to demand immediate wage increases, promotions, and the dismissal of their white officers. The government became even more concerned about the situation when a ministerial car was stoned. Though the situation in the capital was relatively calm, anxiety grew among the European community, which began to arms itself with weapons from illegal stockpiles. Belgian civilians began seeking passage to the French Congo or refuge in the Belgian embassy to await repatriation. Bomboko and Minister Resident in Belgium Albert Delvaux devoted much of their time to assisting them. The provincial presidents, who had been summoned to the capital, met with the Council of Ministers to discuss domestic security in the context of the mutiny. = Government response = left On 8 July the full Council of Ministers convened in an extraordinary session under the chairmanship of Kasa-Vubu at Camp L√©opold II in L√©opoldville to address the task of Africanising the garrison. By then the severity of the mutiny had convinced the ministers that radical reform was necessary in order to maintain the army's discipline. The soldiers on guard prevented them from leaving until they had decided upon their course of action. The Council first heard soldier delegations' grievances; the root cause of their dissatisfaction was that the army's leadership was wholly European despite independence from Belgium. After allowing for the election of a new commandant for the garrison, the ministers debated over who would make a suitable army chief of staff. The two main candidates for the post were Maurice Mpolo and Mobutu. The former had shown some influence over the mutinying troops, but Kasa-Vubu and the Bakongo ministers feared that he would enact a coup d'√©tat if he were given power. The latter was perceived as calmer and more thoughtful. Lumumba saw Mpolo as courageous, but favored Mobutu's prudence. As the discussions continued, the cabinet began to divide themselves according to who they preferred to serve as chief of staff. Lumumba wanted to keep both men in his government and wished to avoid upsetting one of their camps of supporters. During a break he asked Thomas Kanza whether he thought his father, Daniel Kanza, might ultimately make an optimal chief of staff. Though Thomas Kanza told him that Kasa-Vubu and the Bakongo ministers would never accept such a proposal, Lumumba introduced the idea when the ministers reconvened. Kasa-Vubu received the idea in silence, implying his deep displeasure, and Bomboko, Jacques Lumbala, and Delvaux all continuously pushed for Mobutu to be made chief of staff. In the end Mobutu was given the role and awarded the rank of colonel. The ministers then decided that the Minister of Defence should appoint a Congolese sergeant major to replace Janssens as commander-in-chief of the army with the rank of general. Lumumba, at the suggestion of R√©my Mwamba, selected Victor Lundula for the role. In addition to the appointments a state committee for the army‚Äîofficially renamed the Arm√©e Nationale Congolaise (ANC)‚Äîwas formed and put under the charge of a Congolese officer. It was further determined that the President would ex officio be the supreme commander of the military, the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence would control the army in a structure approved by Parliament, and all army units would be placed under the command of Congolese officers. Delegations were to be dispatched across the country to implement the latter reform. The ministers resolved to retain all Belgian officers \\"prepared to serve the Congo loyally\\" and guarantee the security of their income, families, and property so they could act as advisers to their successors. The ministers decided it would be best to publicise their decisions as soon as possible. Immediately after the Council adjourned the garrison of Camp L√©opold II was summoned to the barrack square. Lumumba, acting in his capacity as Minister of Defence, announced the actions the government was taking to address the army's grievances. A communique was distributed by the secretariat of the Council of Ministers to the press and radio, summarising the government's decisions. The Congolese soldiers were satisfied with them and tensions relaxed. Nevertheless, European civilians continued to try and flee the country. On 9 July the government delegations left the capital to oversee the Africanisation of the ANC. Mobutu traveled to √âquateur and while he was there Mpolo acted as ANC Chief of Staff. Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba went directly to Matadi where tensions were quickly worsening. From that point until later in the month the two worked closely with one another and made most major decisions together. After appointing a new garrison commander, supervising the election of other officers, and securing the release of captive Europeans, the pair left the city to inspect other units throughout the Lower Congo. European officers handed over control to the Congolese in Kivu and Orientale without incident (the smooth transfer of power in the former owing to good co-ordination between the officers there and Provincial President Jean Miruho), but the military situation in Kasai and Katanga remained tense and was marked by violence. The government's decision to Africanise the army caused anxiety in the civilian populace of the latter province, which feared such a reform would result in the collapse of domestic security. The provincial government refused to support Africanisation and appealed directly to Belgium to intervene to resolve the situation. The troops subsequently mutinied, both in an attempt to dislodge their officers and to try and ensure that the Katangese provincial government could not effect a secession.  Belgian intervention  Meanwhile in Brussels, news of conflict and abuses against Europeans brought public pressure against the Belgian government to take action. Walter Ganshof van der Meersch and August de Schryver were sent to L√©opoldville with an ultimatum for Lumumba: either a formal request for Belgian military assistance could be made or metropolitan troops would act on their own initiative to protect Belgian citizens. The Belgian ambassador, Jean van den Bosch, urged his government to avoid the latter at all costs. As Lumumba was not in the capital, Ganshof and de Schryver met with other ministers in an attempt to persuade them to agree to a military intervention. Discussions continued late into the evening and though some members of cabinet appeared receptive, Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga was obstinately opposed to such action and ultimately refused to consent. Overnight orders to intervene were delivered several times to the Belgian troops at Kamina base only to be repeatedly countermanded by the government. Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu were informed of the planned intervention and, though initially receptive to the idea, were disturbed that the Belgian government would not make guarantees regarding respect for Congolese sovereignty and subsequently asked that all Belgian troops be withdrawn from Congolese soil. Regardless, the Belgians' decision to intervene ultimately prevailed and at 06:00 on 10 July metropolitan troops from Kamina flew into √âlisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, and occupied the local airport. Later that morning Bomboko met with fleeing Belgians at N'djili Airport. While there he declared that the Belgian intervention had been made at his request, though this was most likely untrue and probably only said to ease tensions. In the afternoon Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu returned to the capital having successfully quelled the unrest in the Lower Congo and convinced that negotiation could resolve the situation. Later they decided to solicit aid from the UN in restructuring the Force Publique. Ministers of the cabinet met with UN representative Ralph Bunche to discuss what technical assistance the UN could offer to the Congolese administration. Bunche shortly thereafter informed Hammarskj√∂ld of the Congolese government's intended request. By evening Lumumba had learned of the Belgian intervention in √âlisabethville. He was furious that the Belgians had acted contrary to the Treaty of Friendship and delivered a response over radio: > We have just learnt that the Belgian government has sent troops to the Congo > and that they have intervened. The responsibility of Belgium is great. We > protest bitterly against these measures which prejudice good relations > between our countries. We appeal to all Congolese to defend our Republic > against those who threaten it. At the same time the Belgians launched a second intervention in Luluabourg. On 11 July Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu flew to the town. After overseeing the election of new officers for the garrison, Lumumba joined Kasa-Vubu in admonishing the Europeans to stay. Most refused to do so unless they had the protection of the Belgian troops. After lengthy negotiation Lumumba agreed to the condition and communicated to the Belgian consul-general that the force could remain in the province of Kasa√Ø for two months. Back in L√©opoldville, Ganshof and de Schryver continued to meet with the ministers with the hopes of establishing a mutual guarantee of security for both Europeans and Africans. Then, for reasons not entirely clear, Belgian units intervened in Matadi. Fighting broke out and 12 Congolese were killed. News of the conflict (along with exaggerated casualty reports) spread to other army camps across the country, resulting in a wave of renewed mutinies and anti-Belgian hostility. Between 10 and 18 July, Belgian forces intervened 28 times in Congolese localities. With the exception of the Luluabourg authorisation, the Belgian troops never acted with the permission of the government. Order was ultimately restored largely through the use of the gendarmerie, a more wieldy and reliable institution than the army.  Aftermath and effects  The Force Publique mutiny increased the unpopularity of the army and cost the government a significant amount of support in rural areas. The insecurity they caused also impeded economic production and the distribution of goods and distracted the leadership from addressing other problems facing the administration. The revolt was the first of many army mutinies that occurred in African states in the 1960s. In the Congo itself, Colonel Mobutu would go on to seize power later in 1960 in a coup d'√©tat, establishing the College of Commissioners-General, which ran the government in 1960-61 under his authority. Five years later Mobutu seized power for a second time, ushering in first quasi-military but then a civilian government. His rule lasted until 1997.

Her first coach was inaugural program director Daniel Campos, a former goalkeeper who began the program in 2012. After much learning, training under the program with various coaches her game needed further development thus in 2014, Moriarty picked Evans as a maiden program candidate for a school sports scholarship. Prior to this, along with other Indigenous youth, she was part of a select group from Borroloola to visit Brazil and experience the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In August 2015, Evans moved to New South Wales where she attended Westfields Sports High School located 3,000 kilometers from Borroloola. \\"I miss family, going out bush and hunting and camping.

According to rumors, the Baksheevs are also responsible for a series of murders and cannibalistic acts. The couple were convicted of the murder and imprisoned in 2019.  Biography  Dmitry was born in 1982, and Natalia in 1975. Natalia worked for some time as a senior nurse in the sanitation department of the Krasnodar Higher Military Aviation School of AK Serov pilots, but was dismissed due to chronic alcoholism. Dmitry had been tried for robbery and car theft, but by the time of the murder, all of his convictions had been extinguished. He worked as an apartment repairman and a general worker. The Baksheevs had lived together since 2012 in a school dormitory, the room being inherited by Natalia from her previous husband. The couple led an antisocial lifestyle. The Baksheevs' crimes were discovered by accident: Dmitry lost his mobile phone, on which there were pictures of him with human remains, even holding a severed human hand in one of them. The phone was later found by road workers and immediately reported to the police. At the interrogation, he claimed that he had found the remains in the bushes, but later confessed to killing a woman. As the investigation later found out, the victim of the Baksheevs was a resident of Krasnodar, Elena Vakhrusheva (born March 5, 1982 in Omutninsk). The murder occurred on September 8 during a joint alcohol drinking session, when a sudden quarrel began between Natalia and Elena. Natalia then told her husband to kill her rival, also actively participating in the murder herself. Elena died as a result of multiple stab wounds. Then the Baksheevs dismembered the corpse, keeping some of the remains in their home, and throwing away others in the surrounding area. During the investigation into the activities in the Baksheev household, fragments of a human body in saline solution, food and frozen meat parts of unknown origin were found. In the basement of the house and the adjoining territory, the remains of the deceased's body were found and seized, while the food and frozen meat fragments were sent for examination. Initially, the criminal case was initiated with a murder charge, but the Baksheevs were later charged with group murder. The case was referred to the first department for investigation of special importance. On September 28, Vadim Bugaenko, the head of the Investigative Department of the Russian Democratic Republic for the Krasnodar Krai, told reporters that the remains found in the Baksheevs' apartment belonged to one person. Also, a procedural check was initiated on the fact of leaked photos from Dmitry's phone, which led to speculations about a family of serial killer-cannibals that operated in the city. Conviction Natalia Baksheeva was convicted in February 2019. The court found her guilty of incitement to murder. She was sentenced to 10 years in a penal colony and 1.5 years in prison. Natalya appealed the decision, but the sentence remained unchanged. On June 28, 2019, Dmitry Baksheev was sentenced to 12 years and 2 months in a maximum-security prison. In addition, he was prescribed compulsory supervision and treatment by a psychiatrist.. On February 16th 2020, Dimitri Baksheev died of untreated type one diabetes while in custody.  Rumors and speculation  The story quickly overgrew with rumors, according to which the couple had been hunting people since 1999. The rumors also said that the cannibals tortured their victims before killing them, and made various dishes from the corpses, keeping the remains canned. According to initial reports, Natalia allegedly supplied the canned human meat to the school where she worked. Later it was suggested that the Baksheevs distributed such canned food to the Krasnodar catering establishments, but those rumors were quickly refuted. Also, the media published a rumor that Dmitry Baksheev allegedly confessed to a murder committed in 2012, and Natalia - to 30 murders. However, the Investigative Committee stated several times that they had no such data on a series of murders for cannibalism by a married couple and that in the Baksheev case there was only one murder. Finally, it was also rumored that during the search of the Baksheevs' apartment, 19 pieces of human skin, 7 body parts, photos of eerie dishes, canned food with human meat, including mammary glands, and even cooking recipes for humans were seized.

At that time, the Electorate of Hanover was ruled in personal union with Great Britain, as the Prince-Elector of Hanover had become King of Great Britain in 1714. A charter granted on 30 November 1720 by George I of Great Britain as Elector granted the Harburg Company commercial privileges in Hanover, including the right to hold a lottery at Harburg, on condition that they undertook to improve the port of Harburg. The titular head of the company was the king's grandson, Prince Frederick but the driving force behind it was John Barrington, the British MP for Berwick and a prominent Presbyterian Dissenter, who was given the post of sub-Governor. The company proceeded with a scheme to organise the lottery, whereby 500,000 tickets would be sold at ¬£3 each. One third of the tickets would win prizes to a total of ¬£1,000,000, creating a gross profit of ¬£500,000. The net profit after \\"management charges\\" would constitute the capital of the company in which losing ticket holders would be shareholders. The main concern was the amount, some ¬£210,000, that would be paid to Barrington and his co-directors, which included the Deputy Governors Sir Thomas Webster, MP, the appropriately named Sir Charles Wager, MP and Robert Baylis. Barrington's main task was to use his influence with the British government to allow the lottery to operate in England, without which the scheme would fail. He was advised by senior ministers in the British Government that the scheme was neither prudent or acceptable but nevertheless pressed on, claiming the King's approval and backing. A week later Parliament set up an enquiry which produced a report on 1 February 1743 condemning the enterprise. The House of Commons Parliament, without a division, passed a resolution declaring the lottery to be fraudulent and illegal, condemned Barrington's use of the King's name, and ordered all ticket sales to be refunded. On 15 February, after hearing Barrington's defence, Parliament resolved that Barrington had been guilty of promoting, abetting, and carrying on a fraudulent undertaking and expelled him from the House of Commons.

A railway line to Burnham-on-Sea ran along the current north-eastern part of the park. A brickworks manufacturing bricks, roof tiles and pipes operated on the site with four kilns.

Hoyle's describes it as \\"really quite an excellent game for the family circle\\" that \\"can be played with equal enjoyment either for counters or for small stakes.\\"  Background  The origin of Slobberhannes is unclear. According to Parlett, the game originated in Germany, its name means \\"Slippery Jack\\", it is the German equivalent of Polignac and may have been the latter's predecessor. However, the game is not attested in any German sources before the 21st century and, despite its name, appears to be of American provenance. Geiser also states that Slobberhannes is a German game and that it is known in Austria as Schinderhansen or Eichelobern, after the nickname of an infamous German outlaw, Johannes B√ºckler, who orchestrated one of the most famous crime sprees in history. Schinderhansen is played in Salzburg, Tyrol and Upper Austria and the name of the variant, Eichelobern, suggests that it is traditionally played with German-suited cards.Geiser, Remigius. \\"100 Kartenspiele des Landes Salzburg\\", p. 47. Along with Snip, Snap, Snorum, Slobberhannes was played by early American settlersThe Railwayan (1952), volumes 36-39, p. 16 and, since, all literary references to it appear in English-language card game books dating back to at least 1885,The American Hoyle: Or, Gentleman's Hand-book of Games. Containing All the Games Played in the United States, with Rules, Descriptions, and Technicalities Adapted to the American Methods of Playing by William Brisbane Dick, Dick & Fitzgerald, 1885Bailey, Arthur R. The Reporter's Word Book, Benn, 1891, p. 136 it may have been originally introduced to the US by German immigrants playing Eichelobern, a variant of Grasobern, which is a Bavarian game with much older roots. Over time the game became played with French playing cards which were locally produced and more easily obtainable.  Rules  = Aim = The game may be played by 3-6 players, but is best suited to 4 players. The aim is to avoid winning the first or last tricks and to avoid capturing the Queen of Clubs.Slobberhannes at whiteknucklecards.com. Retrieved 15 Oct 2018 = Cards = It is played with a 52-card French pack from which the Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives and Sixes have been removed, leaving 32 cards. Cards rank as in Whist, with Ace high and Seven low. The 7 and 7 are omitted if the number of players is other than four. There are no trumps. = Playing = Players cut to determine who leads, the lead player is the one who cuts the highest card. The player to his right deals. Dealing and play are clockwise, 8 cards (assuming there are four players; otherwise 10, 6 or 5) being dealt to each player, one at a time. Players must follow suit if possible; if not, they may play any card. The highest card of the led suit wins the trick and the winner leads to the next trick. = Scoring = A point is deducted in each case from the player who wins the first trick, last trick or the Queen of Clubs. If a player wins all 3, they lose 4 points. A point is also deducted for a revoke, i.e. when a player fails to follow suit and does not correct it before the end of the trick.  Tactics  Possession of the ‚ô£Q is not always dangerous. If it is well \\"guarded\\" and one can rely on it not being forced out by the Club leads of the other players, and one will, sooner or later, be able to discard it. As in Black Maria and those Misere hands which lend so much interest to Solo, one wants to conserve as long as possible the low cards which control the suit.

Biography  Shuvalov was born in 1968 in Leningrad in a well-to-do Soviet family. He the youngest child, and as such, his parents indulged in any of his whims. Shuvalov most of his free time at home, almost never communicating with his peers. As he later said, at the age of 12, his classmates for him the so-called \\"dark\\", severely beating him and, at the same time, cutting his pantyhose into the crotch and pulling it on his head. Subsequently, Shuvalov would treat his victims almost the same way. After school Shuvalov served in the army, then began work for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, serving in the Leningrad Metro Directorate at the stations Yelizarovskaya, Lomonosovskaya, Proletarskaya and Obukhovo, as well as in the Nevsky and Severnoye depots. By the early 1990s, he had risen to the rank of senior sergeant.  Murders  Shuvalov detained underage girls who tried to get into the metro station without a ticket, bypassing the turnstile. Taking them to the interrogation room, he threatened to report the offense to the school and parents, intimidating and then extorting consent to a meeting outside of working hours. The murders took place during such meetings, in the Nevsky Forest Park, only killing girls in pantyhoses. In the forest park, he forced the victims to wear the pantyhose they had brought with them, then raped them. According to experts, Shuvalov was a typical heterosexual maniac- fetishist. His first murder was committed in the fall of 1991, the body being discovered by park employees only two months later. He raped and then drowned 12-year-old Irina Barsukova, managing to evade capture as her death was considered an accident. Over the next four years, Shuvalov committed four more murders.  Arrest and trial  Despite the fact that Shuvalov always destroyed evidence at the crime scene, he was always considered a suspect. The acquaintances of some victims told that an unknown policeman for various reasons (most often for attempting to get a free ride) assigned the missing girls meetings to pay a fine or simply read the morals. Further investigation read to Shuvalov. Trying to collect evidence, the detectives decided to take a risk - they used a girl as bait, but the killer let her go at the last moment and the operation failed. After some time the investigators decided to interrogate Shuvalov as a witness, but before they could ask any questions, he suddenly admitted to everything, despite the fact that all the evidence was indirect. On June 11, 1997, the Leningrad Regional Court sentenced Pavel Shuvalov to death. His last words in court were the following:Shuvalov, even after the sentencing, continued to rely on a pardon and wrote cassation complaints, but the verdict remained unchanged for a while, before eventually being replaced with life imprisonment. Pavel Shuvalov is currently serving his sentence in the \\"Mordovian Zone\\" prison in the village of Sosnovka in Mordovia.

Ruins of Stiris. Stiris () or Steiris (Œ£œÑŒµŒØœÅŒπœÇ) was a town of ancient Phocis situated 120 stadia from Chaeroneia, the road between the two places running across the mountains. The inhabitants of Stiris claimed descent from an Athenian colony of the Attic demus of Steiria, led by Peteus, when he was driven out of Attica by Aegeus. Pausanias describes the city as situated upon a rocky summit, with only a few wells, which did not supply water fit for drinking, which the inhabitants obtained from a fountain, four stadia below the city, to which fountain there was a descent excavated among the rocks. The city contained in the time of Pausanias a temple of Demeter Stiritis, made of crude brick, containing two statues, one of Pentelic marble, the other of ancient workmanship, covered with bandages.-10 Stiris was one of the Phocian cities destroyed by Philip II of Macedon at the close of the Third Sacred War; but it was afterwards rebuilt and was inhabited at the time of the visit of Pausanias. An inscription is preserved dating from the 2nd century BCE regarding a political and religious union (sympoliteia) between Medeon and Stiris, in which both cities had the approval of the Phocian League. The agreement was inscribed on a stele inside the temple of Athena Cranea, in the city of Elateia. The stele preserves the name of the League's strategos, Zeuxis; in addition a sealed copy was to be guarded by a citizen of Lilaea named Trason and there were three persons who acted as witnesses from different Phocian cities: Tithorea, Elateia, and Lilaea. The union included the sanctuaries, the territory, the polis and the ports. From the formalization of the treaty the Medeonites will be with the Stirisians in conditions of equality and will have assemblies and common magistrates. It is not a complete merger of both cities: Stiris is the main city but the citizens of Medeon could designate a hierotamias who would make sacrifices according to the law of Medeon and who would have judicial competency together with the archons of Stiris and could vote. Those who have been magistrates in Medeon will not be required to be so in Stiris unless they decided voluntarily. The administration of the Medeonite sanctuaries will be carried out according to the law of Medeon, and the territory will be common. The location of ancient Stiris is near the modern village of Steiri, where its remains are found on a hill called Palaiochora, located southwest of Livadeia and southeast of Distomo.

Kansas voted for the Republican nominee, Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover of California, over the Democratic nominee, Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York. Hoover's running mate was Senate Majority Leader Charles Curtis of Kansas, while Smith ran with Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson of Arkansas. Hoover won the by a margin of 44.96%. Smith only carried Ellis County, which had (and still has) a large percentage of Roman Catholic residents. Smith was the first Roman Catholic to earn the nomination of a major party for president.

1977?), known as the \\"Luberetsky Maniac\\", was a Soviet serial killer and rapist, who worked as a truck driver.  Biography  In 1975, he killed 12 girls and women, attempting to kill 4 others as well. All the victims were raped and killed at bus stops, struck to the head with a heavy metal object, most often a sledgehammer. Shestakov, who was in a drunk state, then stole all valuables and threw the corpses in garbage dumps. He also had two accomplices: Andrei Vladimirovich Shuvalov (born 1957), who was arrested in November 1975, and his then 16-year-old brother Vladimir. Most of his crimes were committed in the Lyuberetsky District of the Moscow Oblast, with some murders also occurring in the Balashikhinsky District. On March 12, 1976, Shestakov was arrested by operatives while planning to commit another crime. During his detention, a sledgehammer was confiscated from him. On his clothes and in the cabin of his truck, blood samples from the victims were found. During the convoy for the trial, he managed to break out and escape, but was soon detained in an acquaintance's apartment. During the trial, Shestakov and his accomplices could hardly save themselves from the public's lynching. In 1977, the court sentenced Nikolai Shestakov to death, while Andrei Shuvalov and Vladimir Shestakov were sentenced to 15 and 4 years imprisonment respectively. Nikolai Shestakov was supposedly executed by firing squad the same year. By the time of his arrest, he was married and had a child. = In the media = * Documentary film \\"Brothers by blood.\\" from the series \\"The investigation was conducted...\\" * Documentary film \\"A dragon with three heads.\\" from the series \\"Legends of Soviet Detection\\" See also * List of Russian serial killers  References   External links  * Serial killers of Russia (Nikolai Shestakov) Category:Soviet rapists Category:People executed by the Soviet Union by firearm Category:1954 births Category:Soviet serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:Executed Soviet serial killers Category:1977 deaths ","title":"Nikolai Shestakov (serial killer)"},{"id":"58577490","text":"Hoffman Brook is a river in Delaware County, New York.

The mission of the station's crew started in September that year and lasted until July 1944, when they were summarily evacuated after most of them consumed raw polar bear meat and fell sick.  Weather observations in the Arctic  Since the beginning of World War II, the Kriegsmarine was endowed with the task of collecting meteorological data in support of the German war effort. That was accomplished mainly by weather- observation vessels (frequently refitted fishing boats). Motivated by repeated losses of such boats, beginning in 1941, and under direction of Hans-Robert Knoespel, the erection of meteorological stations on land was planned and executed. The first such station around the Arctic Ocean, Knospe, was established in the northwest of the main island of the Svalbard archipelago in October 1941.  Weather troupe Schatzgr√§ber  To prepare members of the meteorological mission for the conditions in the deployment area, the Kriegsmarine's weather department was training candidates in a camp named Goldh√∂he (Czech: Zlat√© n√°vr≈°√≠) in the Krkono≈°e (German: Riesengebirge) mountain range in Silesia. As hardly any more alpine- or arctic-experienced personnel were available, inexperienced meteorologists were to prepare for arctic conditions in the alpine facility. Diverging from established practice, the mission was not named after its team leader, but after H. Schatz, who was heading training operations at Goldh√∂he. Schatz would not join Schatzgr√§ber station, as he was to command the Bassgeiger mission in northeast Greenland at that time. = The meteorological station on Alexandraland = Early in September 1943, the weather observation boat Kehdingen sailed for Alexandra Land from Kiel, via Narvik and Troms√∏. Submarine U 387 was put on escort duty for the trip. Also, the U-boat's crew helped unpack supplies and equipment in the actual establishment of the station. Starting on November 17, Schatzgr√§ber reported weather and temperature data. With the polar night ending,'Schatzgr√§ber added measures of high-altitude / jet stream winds, that were conducted and reported by radio balloons. Resupplication was conducted by U 387 and by parachuting from a Focke-Wulf Condor aircraft. = Mission failing = On May 30, 1944, weather inspector Gerhard Wallik and Obergefreiter Werner Blankenburg hunted and killed a polar bear. Blankenburg, who was also the station's cook, prepared a serving of steak tartare from the animal, which was consumed by all but one member of the station's crew. As Blankenburg had also been the one who had consumed the greatest amount of raw polar bear meat, he was the first to report pain in his legs and a high fever after a few days. Within a month, nine more members of the weather troupe fell ill, with the vegetarian paramedic Gerhard Hoffmann as the only exception. The Kriegsmarine's medical corps remotely attested trichinosis, and the evacuation of the operation was ordered immediately. = Removal of the Schatzgr√§ber weather troupe = To adequately care for the sick troupe, staff surgeon Dr. Wendt of the Troms√∏ marine hospital was chosen. He was to fly in to the station and parachute from a Condor (registration: F8+RL), commanded by naval pilot Oberleutnant Stahnke, who had repeatedly flown parachute resupply missions for the station. The station's commander, Dr. Drees, however, gave conflicting feedback by radio, indicating that an evacuation was unnecessary. In spite of the order for immediate evacuation that was given very early in July, the mission started only on July 7. On board the plane flown by Stahnke was Dr. Wendt, who had gone through a snap parachuting training; however, he was still looking forward to his first jump. Stahnke spared him this experience by bringing the Condor down on Alexandra Land, while damaging the landing gear. The Condor damaged, immediate evacuation was not an option and delusions of those fallen sick added to the difficulty of the situation. A BV 222 seaplane (registration: X4+BH) was sent from Biscarosse to Banak to aid in resupplying spare parts to repair the stranded aircraft. On July 11, the Condor landed with haphazardly-repaired landing gear in Trondheim, carrying all members of the Schatzgr√§ber weather troupe.  Removal of the leftover minefield  To protect the weather station, a minefield had been laid out. However, it could not be removed during the evacuation procedure. When veterans learned in the 1950s, that the Soviet Union had established a weather station on Alexandra Land of their own accord, they attempted to contact the Soviet leadership to submit the mines' positions, but their attempts were altogether ignored. Only in 1990, an expedition conducted by the Norwegian Polar Institute could secure and disarm the mines, building on the original maps of the Schatzgr√§ber weather troupe. Today, one of the mines removed from the site is an exhibit at Forsvarsmuseet in Oslo. In 2016, some 500 artifacts from what appears to be the base were discovered and removed for study.Russian Scientists Say They've Discovered a Secret Nazi Base in The Arctic  References  Category:Meteorological stations Category:Nazi Germany Category:Franz Josef Land ","title":"Schatzgr√§ber (weather station)"},{"id":"58577526","text":"Richard Newbold Adams (August 4, 1924 ‚Äì September 11, 2018) was an American anthropologist.

It is an example of an s-block main group sandwich compound, structurally related to the d-block element metallocenes, and consists of a central magnesium atom sandwiched between two cyclopentadienyl rings.  Properties  Magnesocene is a white solid at room temperature. It has a melting point of 176 ¬∞C, though at atmospheric pressures it sublimes at 100 ¬∞C. Unlike ferrocene, magnesocene displays slight dissociation and subsequent ion association in polar, electron-donating solvents (such as ether and THF). :MgCp2 <=> MgCp+ + Cp- :MgCp2 + MgCp+ <=> Mg2Cp3+ :MgCp2 + Cp- <=> MgCp3- While ferrocene is stable at ambient conditions, magnesocene decomposes rapidly on exposure to oxygen or moisture, and as such must be synthesized and stored under inert conditions.  Structure & Bonding  As revealed by X-ray crystallographic refinement, solid-phase magnesocene exhibits an average Mg-C and C-C bond distance of 2.30 √Ö and 1.39 √Ö, respectively, and the Cp rings adopt a staggered conformation (point group D5d). Gas-phase electron diffraction has shown similar bond lengths, albeit with the Cp rings in an eclipsed conformation (point group D5h). The nature of Mg-Cp bonding has been hotly contested as to whether the interaction is primarily ionic or covalent in character. Gas-phase electron diffraction measurements have been invoked to argue for a covalent model, while vibrational spectroscopy measurements have offered evidence for both. Hartree-Fock calculations have shown that, in contrast to transition metal metallocenes, the Mg 3d orbitals play no role in metal-ring bonding; instead, favorable bonding interactions with the Cp œÄ system are accomplished by promotion of the two 3s electrons to the 3px,y orbitals. Further stabilization is afforded by back-donation from the Cp rings to the Mg 3s orbital. Such interactions afford a lesser degree of orbital overlap as compared to ferrocene, resulting in a comparatively weak metal-ring bond and a fairly high effective local charge on Mg. Experimental evidence in favor of an ionic bonding model can thus be explained by the very weak, highly polar Mg-Cp interactions. The weak nature of this bonding mode is responsible for magnesocene's relative instability and vigorous reactivity when compared to ferrocene.  Synthesis  = High-temperature synthesis = The first synthesis of magnesocene, as reported by F. A. Cotton and Geoffrey Wilkinson in 1954, involved the thermal decomposition of the cyclopentadienyl Grignard reagent.Wilkinson, G.; Cotton, F. A. (1954). Chemistry & Industry (London). 11: 307. A similar procedure was offered by W. A. Barber in which cyclopentadiene is directly reacted with solid magnesium at 500-600 ¬∞C. Under water- and oxygen-free conditions, freshly distilled monomeric cyclopentadiene is directed through a tube furnace by an inert carrier gas (such as helium, argon, or nitrogen) and passed over magnesium turnings or powder. Magnesocene deposits on cooler surfaces past the exit end of the furnace. The product of this process is typically a white, fluffy mass of fine microcrystals, but large, colorless single crystals can be obtained by adjusting temperature and flow rate. If solid magnesocene is not needed, the receiving flask can instead be filled with solvent and the product collected in solution, which Barber noted as much safer to handle than the pure solid. :Mg + 2C5H6 ->[500-600 ^oC] Mg(C5H5)2 + H2 This procedure is capable of producing a gram of product every two minutes under ideal conditions, and that with a vertical setup (in which cyclopentadiene is directed downwards and the product collected below) nearly pure product can be obtained at >80% yield (by cyclopentadiene). A horizontal setup was shown to be possible but at the expense of product purity, due to gas flow restriction by product accumulation. = Liquid-phase methods = Magnesocene can be produced from magnesium turnings in THF at mild conditions with cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride (CpTiCl3) acting as a catalyst.

Magnesocene formation from elemental magnesium has not been observed in THF without a catalyst present. Attempts to substitute THF with diethyl ether, diglyme, or benzene resulted only in polymerization of cyclopentadiene. :539x539px The syntheses of magnesocene and its derivatives have also been carried out in hydrocarbon solvents, such as heptane, from Cp and (nBu)(sBu)Mg. :460x460px Metallation of cyclopentadiene can also be accomplished by Mg-Al alkyl complexes with a final magnesocene yield of 85%. :710x710px  Reactivity & potential applications  Magnesocene serves as an intermediate in the preparation of transition metal metallocenes: :MgCp2 + MCl2 -> MCp2 + MgCl2 Magnesocene also undergoes ligand exchange reactions with MgX2 (X = halide) to form CpMgX half-sandwich compounds in THF: :MgCp2 + MgX2 <=> 2 CpMgX The resulting half-sandwich halides can serve as starting materials for synthesizing substituted cyclopentadienes from organic halides. Because of its high reactivity, magnesocene is an attractive target for semiconductor research as a starting material for chemical vapor deposition and doping applications. magnesocene has also been investigated for its potential use as an electrolyte in next- generation magnesium ion batteries.

It stars Taylor Schilling, Jackson Robert Scott and Colm Feore. The plot centers around a child whose disturbing behavior signals that an evil, possibly supernatural being has taken control of him, forcing his parents to investigate whether sinister forces are involved. The Prodigy was released in the United States on February 8, 2019, by Orion Pictures. The film grossed over $21 million and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances and atmosphere but criticized the story and dialogue. Plot On August 22, 2010, in rural Ohio, serial killer, Edward Scarka, is fatally shot during a police raid of his farmhouse. At the time of Edward's death, married couple Sarah and John give birth to their son, Miles, in Pennsylvania. Miles shows extreme wisdom and intelligence from a young age and begins speaking fluently before he is even a toddler. When Miles turns eight in 2018, Sarah and John begin noticing behavioral changes in him. One night he plays a prank on his babysitter Zoe, seriously injuring her, but claims no memory of the incident. At school, he attacks a classmate with a wrench. Sarah brings Miles to psychiatrist Elaine Strasser and turns over a tape recording of him talking apparent gibberish in his sleep. Elaine gives the tape to a colleague, Arthur Jacobson, an expert on rebirth and reincarnation. Arthur reveals that the gibberish Miles spoke is, in fact, a rare dialect of Hungarian and that the words translate to \\"I'll cut your eyes out and watch you die, whore.\\" Sarah is unwilling to believe Arthur's assertion that an unsettled spirit wants control of the boy's body. At home, the family's dog goes missing, and John becomes infuriated when he finds that Miles has been recording the couple's bedroom with a baby monitor. John leaves to stay with his brother, leaving Sarah alone with Miles. Sarah later finds a swarm of flies in the house and discovers the family's dismembered dog in the basement. Miles apologizes, explaining that someone is invading his dreams every night and that he has to \\"make room.\\" Sarah brings Miles to see Arthur, who hypnotizes him in the hopes of engaging in past life regression, which will allow him to speak to the dark spirit in Miles's body. The regression is successful, and the individual explains that his parents were Hungarian immigrants. The session goes awry when Miles threatens to accuse Arthur of drugging and molesting him, which prompts Arthur to end the session. Afterward, Arthur finds \\"Scarka\\" carved into his leather couch from the boy's fingernails. He calls Sarah and explains that he believes Miles's body is being possessed by Edward Scarka, attempting to return to continue his killing spree. Upon researching Edward, Sarah finds he died only minutes before Miles's birth and is startled to see that, like Miles, he had two different- colored eyes. John and Sarah decide to have Miles committed, but Miles stabs John en route to the facility, causing him to crash; John goes into a coma as a result of the accident. In Miles's room, Sarah uncovers a cache of newspaper clippings about Edward's crimes, as well as a book by Margaret St. James, Edward's final victim, who escaped and led authorities to him. Sarah realizes Edward is attempting to return to claim Margaret. She decides to kill Margaret herself, ending Edward's need for Miles's body. She drugs Miles with sleeping pills and the two drive to Margaret's rural farmhouse. Sarah poses as a battered woman who was touched by Margaret's book, persuading Margaret to allow her inside. She then draws a gun but is unable to bring herself to shoot. Miles enters and brutally attacks Margaret with a butcher knife, stabbing and disemboweling her. Sarah chases Miles outside to console him, believing Edward has left his body now that his final deed is complete. However, he reveals that Edward has taken full control, and Miles's soul has already been vanquished. Horrified, Sarah attempts to shoot him, but before she can, a farmer shoots her with a rifle, killing her. Sometime later, Miles is taken to live in a temporary foster home until John is discharged from the hospital. In his new bedroom, Miles stares into a mirror, which reflects the image of Edward.

Daniel Bekerman, Lisa Zambri, Nick Spicer and Jeff Buhler will serve as executive producers. During the film's production, Orion Pictures' president John Hegeman said about the project in a statement: In October 2018, McCarthy revealed that a scene had to be re-edited after it was found that it made a test audience scream so much that they missed the following dialogue. The film includes an interview with another family who believed their child had memories of a previous life. That was actual footage of a real interview about James Leininger, whose parents believed his nightmares about plane crashes were caused by having had a previous life as a World War II pilot. =Casting= By June 2018, Jackson Robert Scott, Peter Mooney, Colm Feore and Brittany Allen were cast in the film. =Filming= Principal photography on the film began in March 2018 and wrapped in the same month in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. =Music= The dark orchestral score was composed by Joseph Bishara and released on vinyl in 2019 by Waxwork Records. Release The film was released in the United States on February 8, 2019, by Orion Pictures. Reception =Box office= The Prodigy has grossed $14.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $6.2 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $21.1 million, against a production budget of $6 million. In the United States and Canada, The Prodigy was released on February 8, 2019, alongside The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, Cold Pursuit and What Men Want, and was projected to gross $8‚Äì11 million from 2,530 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $2 million on its first day, including $350,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $6 million, finishing sixth at the box office, although Deadline Hollywood noted given the film's $6 million production budget the studio was satisfied with the results and the film would likely net a profit. =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 41% based on 80 reviews, with an average rating of 5.01/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Prodigy doesn't take the bad seed genre to any truly new places, but for horror fans in search of an evil child to fear, it might still be worth a watch.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

Geologic history, stratigraphy & tectonics The Precambrian granite and gneiss crystalline basement rocks beneath Alberta are extremely ancient, dating to the Archean and Proterozoic. The Slave Craton and Southern Alberta craton are the oldest units at more 2.5 billion years old, while younger units from the Proterozoic include the Wopmay orogeny, Great Slave Lake shear zone, Pre-Taltston basement, Taltson magmatic zone, Athabasca polymetamorphic terrane, Red Earth granulite domain, Kimiwan isotopic anomaly, Ksituan magmatic arc, Virgin River shear zone, Central Alberta intrusions and Lacombe domain. In many cases, Proterozoic deformation overprinted older Archean rocks. The Hudsonian Orogeny from 1.9 to 1.6 billion years ago was the last major regional metamorphic event.http://rruff.info/doclib/cm/vol38/CM38_423.pdf =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= Throughout the late Precambrian and Paleozoic, a long- running marine transgression flooded western Alberta, accumulating sedimentary rocks on a basement of 1.8 billion year old Churchillian rocks. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= Carbonate deposition common in the Paleozoic ended during the Jurassic as the North American continent moved westward with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The Guichon Batholith emplaced 200 million years ago, near Ashcroft, British Columbia and was accompanied by a period of erosion that wore away Devonian, Mississippian and Triassic strata from east to west. The Late Jurassic Morrison Formation, known for its stockpiles of dinosaur bones formed as uplift in the Black Hills of western South Dakota shed sediments into Alberta. Advancing river deltas lay down the Kootenay Formation and Ferni basin in the Banff area, with offshore sands forming the Nikanassin Formation in Jasper further north. Until the Valanginian, marine conditions continued in Peace River arch and Keg River low, forming the Cretaceous Bullhead and Minnes groups. With the uplift of the Rocky Mountains, erosion accelerated in Alberta stripping away up to 3500 feet (1075 meters) of the Kootenay Formation. Rivers flowing across British Columbia reversed course with debris blockage and deposited the Elk conglomerate atop the Kootenay Formation. Rivers shifted northward toward the Arctic Ocean, which transgressed southward, flooding much of Alberta in the Aptian. Fluvial coal swamps and deltas of the Blairmore and Manville groups formed along the edge of the ocean. These shorelines were important for coal and oil and gas formation. The Blairmore Group reaches up to 2500 feet (770 meters) thick, divided into the Gladstone Formation conglomerate, sandstone, green shale and non-marine red shale, the Beaver Mines Formation with shale and chlorite sandstone and the Mill Creek Formation with pyroclastic flow sediments, related to Mesozoic volcanism in the Canadian Rockies. North of the Calgary- Banff highway, the Gladstone and Beaver Mines Formation become carbonaceous and coal-bearing. A significant unconformity separates the Blairmore Group from overlying rocks. During the Cenomanian and Albian, the connection with the Arctic Ocean was nearly severed, creating the Mowry sea, which developed its own endemic group of ammonites. Fossils across western Canada with both exotic and endemic fish scales and ammonites indicates that the Gulf of Mexico flooded the area from the south. The sea filled with fine sediments of the Colorado Group concurrent with the deposition of clastic and volcanic sediments in the Mill Creek Formation. The Joli Fou shale and Viking (Bow Island) sand, plus lower Colorado Group shales cover the Blaimore Group in southern Alberta. The Colorado Group (known locally as the Alberta Group) occupies the Cordilleran foothills with the 1700 foot thick Blackstone Formation near Nordegg, which holds silty and platy shales, together with the Cardium Formation marine sandstone and shales, and the Wapiabi Formation which reaches up to 2000 feet thick with mudstone, ironstone and ammonite fossils. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= During the Cenozoic sedimentation continued in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, spanning Alberta. The Paskapoo Formation deposited near the Rockies, together with the Ravenscrag Formation in the southern Cypress Hills Formation.

Its position is described in a passage of Theopompus, preserved by Strabo, who says that it stood at a distance of 40 stadia from Chaeroneia, in the entrance from Boeotia into Phocis, on a height of moderate elevation, situated between Parnassus and Mount Hedylium; he adds that these two mountains were separated from each other by an interval of 5 stadia, through which the Cephissus flowed. The Cephissus flowed into the territory of Parapotamii after leaving that of Elateia and before that of Panopeus; Parapotamii's territory was adjacent to those of Ambrysus, Panopeus, and Daulis. Pausanias emphasized the great fertility of its area which was such that it was even said that the name of Parapotamii was the designation for those who had their crops next to Cephissus and that they referred to a verse of Homer in the Catalogue of Ships of the Iliad that read: \\"And those who dwelt by the divine river Cephissus\\" During the Greco-Persian Wars, Parapotamii was one of the places destroyed by the Achaemenid army under Xerxes I in 480 BCE In 395 BCE, its territory was sacked by the Boeotians, who however were unsuccessful in their attempt to assault the city.Hellenica Oxyrhynchia 21.5.

Pausanias mentions that, during the first Pythian Games (582 BCE) organized by the Delphic Amphictyony, in the youth boxing, Ecmeas of Parapotamii was a victor. He adds that after its destruction it was not rebuilt and that in his time (2nd century) there were no more ruins and no one remembered the exact place where it was.

Police believe Hupp murdered Gumpenberger as part of a plot to implicate Russ Faria in the 2011 murder of his wife, Betsy Faria, a crime for which he was convicted in 2013, in part due to testimony from Hupp, and subsequently exonerated in 2015 after evidence implicating Hupp as the perpetrator of the murder was permitted to be submitted. The murder of Betsy Faria, which was featured in five Dateline NBC episodes airing from 2014 to 2019, has never been solved; the investigation was reopened in June 2019. Hupp has also been investigated in connection with the 2013 death of her mother, Shirley Neumann.  Early life  Born on October 10, 1958, Neumann grew up in Dellwood, Missouri, attending Riverview Gardens High School. Hupp held several jobs in the life insurance industry; on two occasions, she was fired for forging signatures. In 2001, Hupp and her husband began living in O'Fallon, Missouri, where she worked as an administrator for State Farm. By 2010, Hupp had stopped working and was claiming disability benefits for back, leg, and neck pain.  Criminal accusations and convictions  = Investigation into the murder of Betsy Faria =  Death of Betsy Faria  Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" Kay Faria (1969‚Äì2011) was a coworker of Pam Hupp at State Farm. She lived in Troy, Missouri, with her husband, Russell \\"Russ\\" Scott Faria, and two daughters from a previous relationship. In 2010, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. In October 2011, she learned that the cancer had metastasized to her liver and was terminal. On December 22, 2011, unbeknownst to her family, Betsy Faria changed the sole beneficiary of her $150,000 State Farm life insurance policy from her husband to Hupp. Hupp originally claimed that Betsy Faria had asked her to give the money to her daughters when they were older, before later claiming that Betsy Faria had wanted her to keep the money for herself. Betsy Faria's daughters launched a legal challenge against Hupp and her husband to attempt to claim the life insurance policy in 2014; it was dismissed in 2016. Prosecutors speculated that her husband had been angered by her actions, giving him a motive for her murder. Russ Faria remained the beneficiary on a separate $100,000 policy. On December 27, 2011, Betsy Faria underwent chemotherapy at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center and then visited her mother's house, after which she was driven home by Hupp, making Hupp the last confirmed person to have seen her alive. Betsy Faria had originally been scheduled to be driven home by a family friend until Hupp had driven to her mother's house and insisted on driving her home. Hupp claimed that she had dropped Betsy Faria off at approximately 19:00. Russ Faria spent the evening at his friend Michael Corbin's home watching films until 21:00, then drove to an Arby's in Lake St. Louis before returning home. At 21:40 that evening, Russ Faria called 9-1-1 and reported that he had returned to his home to find his wife had committed suicide. Betsy Faria had been stabbed over 55 times with her arms almost entirely severed and the murder weapon, a serrated kitchen knife, left lodged in her neck. A second knife was found under a pillow on the couch she had been lying on. First responders arrived at 21:49 and concluded that Betsy Faria had been dead for at least one hour and likely longer.  Conviction of Russ Faria  Suspicion swiftly fell on Russ Faria, and he was arrested on the day following the murder. His initial assertion that Betsy Faria had killed herself was considered to be \\"ludicrous\\" by first responders who observed her body. A search of the house by police found a bloodstained pair of slippers in his closet. His volatile emotional state was regarded as \\"suspicious\\" by police. He ostensibly failed a polygraph test administered by police. When interviewed by police, Hupp claimed that Russ Faria had a \\"violent temper\\", that he was a heavy drinker, that he had threatened Betsy Faria, and that Betsy Faria had been considering leaving him. At the behest of Hupp, police searched Betsy Faria's laptop and found a document in which Betsy Faria purportedly expressed fears that her husband would murder her (it was later revealed that the document was written in Word 97, software that was not installed on the laptop, and was the only document on the laptop with \\"author unknown\\"). On January 4, 2012, the day after Betsy Faria's funeral, Russ Faria was charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action. As he was unable to meet the bail of $250,000, he was held in the Lincoln County jail until his trial began on November 18, 2013. During Russ Faria's trial, his defense attorney, Joel Schwartz, argued that the testimonies of the four friends he had been visiting and evidence of him making purchases from multiple different stores over the course of the evening demonstrated that the timeline did not allow for him to commit the murder, particularly given there were no traces of blood on his body or clothes. The prosecuting attorney, Leah Askey, countered by arguing that Russ Faria's friends were providing a false alibi and that they had colluded with him to carry out the murder. The trial judge, Chris Mennemeyer, refused to allow Schwartz to present evidence implicating Hupp as an alternative suspect, including cellphone records showing that Hupp had been in the vicinity of the Faria house for up to 30 minutes after the time she had claimed to drop her off at or the fact of Hupp being named as sole beneficiary of the life insurance policy shortly before the murder. On November 21, 2013, Russ Faria was convicted on both counts. On December 22, 2013 he was sentenced to life plus 30 years imprisonment and sent to the Jefferson City Correctional Center. Although a central premise of the prosecution's case was that Russ Faria's four friends had been complicit in the murder, no charges were ever brought against them.  Acquittal of Russ Faria and reopening of investigation  In February 2014, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch published an expos√© revealing that the $150,000 received by Hupp had been kept by her rather than put into a trust for Betsy Faria's daughters and that Hupp had made contradictory statements during her interviews with police, initially claiming she had not entered the Faria house after driving her home and then revising this account twice. The expos√© featured an interview with the 9-1-1 operator who had taken Russ Faria's call, who stated that she believed his hysterical state upon making the call was genuine. The expos√© also claimed that prosecuting attorney Leah Askey had been in a relationship with Mike Lang, the then-captain of investigations for the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office and one of the investigating officers in the Betsy Faria murder case, who testified against Russ Faria in his trial. Two members of the jury in Russ Faria's trial approached the media to flag concerns that this information had been withheld. Schwartz appealed the verdict. In February 2015, the Missouri Court of Appeals sent the case back to the 45th Circuit Court for a hearing on a retrial. After judge Chris Mennemeyer recused herself from the case, in June 2015, 22nd Circuit Court judge Steven Ohmer granted a motion by Schwartz for a new bench trial based on the evidence that had emerged, with Russ Faria released on bond pending the trial. During the retrial, Schwartz was allowed to introduce evidence implicating Hupp as the perpetrator. CSI agent Amy Buettner, who had examined the crime scene, stated that she believed the bloodied slippers found in Russ Faria's closet had not stepped in blood. During the trial, police officers disclosed that Hupp - who was not called to testify in the trial - had claimed in interviews conducted in June that she and Betsy Faria had been in a sexual relationship. Hupp also stated to police that she had \\"remembered\\" seeing Russ Faria and another man in a car parked in a side street outside the Faria home as she drove Betsy Faria home. On November 7, 2015, Faria's conviction was overturned; he had been imprisoned for slightly under four years. In July 2016, Russ Faria lodged a civil rights lawsuit against Leah Askey and three officers of the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office on the basis that they had \\"fabricated evidence, ignored exonerating evidence and failed to investigate the other obvious suspect.\\" In January 2017, Judge Chris Mennemeyer was suspended by the Supreme Court of Missouri for misconduct unrelated to the Faria case. In August 2018, both Mennemeyer and Leah Chaney (formerly Leah Askey) were voted out of office, with the handling of the murder case and subsequent trial cited as a major contributor. The decision not to investigate Pam Hupp as the potential perpetrator of the murder had been widely criticized; a former employee of the Lincoln County Prosecutor‚Äôs Office stated in November 2016, \\"There were several of us that kept thinking, why are we not pursuing Pam Hupp? [...] They were just locked down on Russ.\\" In September 2019, federal judge for the Eastern District of Missouri John Andrew Ross dismissed Chaney from the lawsuit on the basis of prosecutorial immunity. In August 2016, the Lincoln County prosecuting attorney and Lincoln County Sheriff's Office issued a press release stating that they were cooperating with the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri in a review of the Betsy Faria murder case. In January 2018, attorneys acting for Russ Faria depositioned Hupp as part of Faria's lawsuit against Lincoln County, asking her 92 questions relating to the murder of Betsy Faria. Hupp declined to answer the questions. In response to the refusal, Faria's attorneys sought a court order to force a response. In June 2018, 11th Circuit Court judge Jon Cunningham ruled that prosecutors in the trial of Hupp for the murder of Louis Gumpenberger could present evidence relating to Faria's murder. In June 2019, following Hupp's entering of an Alford guilty plea to the murder of Gumpenberger, Lincoln County prosecuting attorney Mike Wood announced that he would be reopening the Betsy Faria murder investigation. In October 2019, Wood requested a case review by the Major Case Squad. In March 2020, Russ Faria received a settlement worth over $2 million. In August 2020, Rick Harrell - the new sheriff of Lincoln County, Missouri - stated that the Betsy Faria murder case had inspired him to run for sheriff. = Investigation into the death of Shirley Neumann = Shirley Mae Neumann (n√©e Russell; 1935‚Äì2013) was the mother of Pam Hupp and three other children. She graduated from St. Louis Community College‚ÄìFlorissant Valley and the University of Missouri‚ÄìSt. Louis, subsequently working as a teacher in Jennings and Ferguson, Missouri. Predeceased by her husband in 2000, by 2013 she was living alone in a third-floor apartment in the Lakeview Park Independent Senior Living Community in Fenton, Missouri and suffering from dementia and arthritis. Neumann spent the night of October 29, 2013, with Hupp following a hospital visit. At approximately 17:00 on October 30, Hupp dropped her off at her apartment, instructing staff not to expect her for dinner that evening or breakfast the following day. A housekeeper found Neumann dead beneath the balcony of her home at 14:30 on October 31, 2013. The aluminum balcony railing was broken. Following a police investigation, assistant medical examiner Raj Nanduri concluded that she had died from blunt trauma to the chest resulting from an accidental fall. An autopsy found that she had .84 micrograms of the sedative Zolpidem in her blood; over eight times the expected concentration for someone having taken a normal dose. In November 2013, the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office received an anonymous note that suggested Hupp had murdered her mother to receive life insurance. Hupp was the last person known to have seen her mother alive. Hupp and her siblings each received approximately $120,000 of investments held by Neumann, as well as sharing a $10,000 life insurance payout. Earlier that year, prior to her mother's death, Hupp had been videotaped saying \\"my mom's worth half a million that I get when she dies [...] if I really wanted money, there was an easier way than trying to combat somebody that's physically stronger than me\\". The police reopened their investigation but after interviewing the housekeeper who had found Neumann's body and Neumann's son Michael - both of whom stated that Neumann was \\"unsteady\\" - again concluded that her death was accidental. They did not interview Hupp. In 2016, after Hupp was charged with the murder of Louis Gumpenberger, the St. Louis County Police Department police reopened the investigation. Neumann's son Michael reiterated that he believed his mother's death to have been accidental. Detective Matthew Levy attempted to get a subpoena for the location of Hupp's cellphone at the time of her mother's death but was unsuccessful. Levy also attempted to organise forensic tests on the balcony railing at the Missouri University of Science and Technology but the Lakeview Park Independent Senior Living Community refused to provide a railing for testing. In November 2017, Mary Case, the chief medical examiner for St. Louis County, changed the manner of Neumann's death from \\"accidental\\" to \\"undetermined\\". Case stated, \\"since [Neumann's] death, many things have happened that involved the daughter. And so all of that investigation, including the one in Lincoln County and the one in St. Charles, became pertinent information [...] I was no longer willing to say it could be an accident.\\" The investigation into Neumann's death was not reopened. In May 2018, St. Charles County Circuit Judge Jon Cunningham ruled that prosecutors in Hupp's trial for the murder of Louis Gumpenberger could not present evidence relating to Neumann's death. = Murder of Louis Gumpenberger =  Death of Louis Gumpenberger and criminal investigation  Louis Royse Gumpenberger (1983‚Äì2016) was a resident of St. Charles, Missouri. Following a car crash in 2005, he suffered from severe mental and physical impairments. On August 16, 2016, Gumpenberger died after being shot five times by Hupp in her home in O'Fallon, Missouri. A note was found on his body bearing instructions to \\"kidnap Hupp, get Russ's money from Hupp at her bank, and kill Hupp\\" and to \\"Take Hupp back to house and get rid of her. Make it look like Russ' wife. Make sure knife sticking out of neck.\\" in return for a reward of $10,000. As Hupp had called 9-1-1 shortly before shooting Gumpenberger, the audio of the incident was recorded. Hupp claimed that Gumpenberger, armed with a knife, had jumped out of a car (driven by another person) into her driveway, accosted her while she sat in her sport utility vehicle in her garage, and demanded she drive them to a bank to retrieve \\"Russ' money\\". Hupp claimed that she had knocked the knife out of Gumpenberger's hand and then fled into her house, shooting Gumpenberger in self-defence with a Ruger LCR she kept on her nightstand after he pursued her. The St. Charles County prosecuting attorney and the O'Fallon chief of police theorized that Hupp had lured Gumpenberger to her home by presenting herself as \\"Cathy\\", a producer for the television program Dateline NBC, and offering to pay him to reenact a 9-1-1 call, then shot him in order to implicate Russ Faria in an attempt on her life (and \\"take heat off her\\"), planting the knife and the note on his body. Several pieces of evidence were identified: * Cellphone records showed that Hupp had been in Gumpenberger's neighborhood less than one hour before the shooting, contradicting her claim that she had never met him before. * On August 10, 2016, a police report had been filed with the St. Charles County police stating that a woman matching Hupp's description had approached O'Fallon resident Carol Alford posing as a Dateline NBC producer and offering her $1,000 to reenact a 9-1-1 call; security camera footage showed that the woman in question had been driving Hupp's car. A second witness, Brent Charlton, informed police that Hupp had approached him with a similar proposition. * Police investigators found nine $100 bills in Gumpenberger's pocket; a tenth $100 bill found on Hupp's dresser had a sequential serial number to four of the nine bills. * Police investigators suggested that the knife had been purchased at the Dollar Tree in O'Fallon alongside several other items found in Hupp's house. * The knife found in Hupp's car was found wedged between the passenger seat and the central console. Knives in Hupp's kitchen were similarly stored wedged between the stove and counter. * A carpet swatch found by police appeared to have been positioned to protect a rug in Hupp's home from Gumpenberger's blood. * Police investigators were skeptical that Gumpenberger's severe physical and mental impairments following his accident would have allowed him to carry out the acts Hupp described him doing.  Conviction and imprisonment  On August 23, 2016, Hupp was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action. Upon being arrested, she asked to visit a bathroom, where she used a ballpoint pen to stab her neck and wrists in an apparent suicide attempt; St. Charles County assistant prosecutor Phil Groenweghe described the act as \\"consciousness of guilt\\". Bail for Hupp was set at $2 million. On December 16, 2016, a grand jury indicted Hupp for first-degree murder and armed criminal action. Hupp appeared in court on January 31, 2017, pleading not guilty to the charges. In March 2017, prosecutors stated that they would seek the death penalty due to the apparently arbitrary choice of Gumpenberger as the victim. In August 2018, Hupp's trial date was set for June 2019. On June 19, 2019, Hupp entered an Alford guilty plea to the charges of first-degree murder and armed criminal action, waiving her right to a jury trial. As a condition of a deal struck with prosecutors, Hupp did not face the death penalty. She was sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole on August 12, 2019. She is serving her sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center in Chillicothe, Missouri. In a phonecall to her husband, Hupp claimed that she had pled guilty \\"so that her family wouldn't have to witness an ugly trial\\". In October 2019, Gumpenberger's mother Margaret Burch filed a lawsuit for wrongful death, fraud, and misrepresentation against the incarcerated Hupp, seeking \\"a sum in excess of the jurisdictional limits of this court\\". In July 2020, Burch was awarded a wrongful death judgment of $3 million USD. In October 2020, Hupp's husband Mark Hupp filed for divorce.  Media coverage  The murder of Betsy Faria was the subject of five Dateline NBC episodes: \\"The House on Sumac Drive\\" (2014), \\"Game Night\\" (2015), \\"Return to Game Night\\" (2016), \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" (2016), and \\"The Thing About Pam\\" (2019). Faria's murder has received more coverage from Dateline NBC than any other subject aside from O. J. Simpson and JonBen√©t Ramsey. In July 2019, filmmaker Daniel Blake Smith announced that he was writing and producing a feature film based on the stories of Russ Faria and his defense attorney Joel Schwartz, \\"PROOF\\". In September 2019, the murder of Louis Gumpenberger was the subject of the inaugural Dateline NBC true crime podcast. The podcast spent several weeks as one of the most popular Apple podcasts. In October 2019, the Riverfront Times dubbed Hupp St Louis' \\"best local girl gone bad\\" of 2019, stating \\"few stories are quite so made-for-TV\\" and \\"the tale of Pam Hupp screams for serialization\\". In May 2020, NBC News Studios and Blumhouse Television announced that they were co-producing a new scripted television series based on the murder of Betsy Faria.

Early life and education Mary \\"Paul\\" Pollard was born in Essex, England on 5 June 1922. She was the eldest of the three daughters and a son of Richard Payne Pollard and his wife (n√©e Wilkinson). Her father was an Irish emigrant. Pollard attended Hawnes School before going on to study medicine for a number of years, abandoning that just before completing her studies to take up librarianship. She took a position at Southlands Teacher Training College, now a part of the University of Roehampton while she studied for the associateship of the Library Association. Career Pollard came to Dublin in 1957 to take up two part time positions, one at Marsh's Library and the Library of Trinity College Dublin. Marsh's Library could not pay her a full salary, instead provided her with a flat under the library, which was notoriously cold, where she lived for the rest of her life. She kept these two jobs for 8 years, until she took up a full time post at Trinity. Throughout her career her specialism was in early printed books, becoming the designated rare book librarian at Trinity in 1964. Her research and dissertation for the fellowship of the Library Association was titled The woodcut ornament stocks of the Dublin printers 1551‚Äì1700 with lists of unsigned works identified as from their presses for which she received distinction. She was in charge of the department of older printed books, which was housed in the reconstructed east pavilion of the Old Library, which opened to readers in 1968. This department initially handled books from pre-1800, but went on to cover the entire contents of the Old Library and Gallery which included 19th century material. Pollard oversaw an overall improvement in the library's antiquarian books with relatively little funds. She identified gaps in the library's collections on 18th century English literature, drama and language, as well as Irish political, economic and social works, and sought to fill these. When funds were available she directed the purchase of collections such as that of Jonathan Swift and related objects at the T. A. Hollick sale at Sotheby's in 1976 with money from the trustees of the estate of Alfred Chester Beatty. Pollard implemented the use of Anglo-American cataloguing rules, creating a more rigorous catalogue of early printed books, developing a supplementary code in 1970 which provided for a complete analysis of all the physical aspects of a book. During the same period she began to informally teach academics and postgraduates on historical bibliography, which was eventually officially included within the M.Phil. in reformation and enlightenment studies. As part of her work with this course, Pollard established a hand press, the Trinity Closet Press, now housed in the basement of the College Printing House. She was appointed sub-librarian in 1970 and the first keeper of early printed books in 1980. She retired from the post of keeper in 1983 to focus on her research on the Dublin book trade. This research went on to be published in two books: Dublin's trade in books, 1550‚Äì1800 (1989) and A dictionary of members of the Dublin book trade, 1550‚Äì1800 (2000). The first volume was initially a Lyell Lecture given in Oxford. In the early 1960s, Pollard established her own hand press in a disused room in Marsh's Library with the help of Liam Miller. Over the course of 20 years, she published very limited editions of prose squibs and verse satires on contemporary events. Later life and legacy In 2001 Dublin University awarded her an honorary D.Litt., and in 2002 she was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy. A Festschrift, That woman!: studies in Irish bibliography was published in 2005. Pollard died on 24 June 2005. She had an extensive collection of 11,500 pre-1914 children's books at her flat, which she collected over the course of 50 years. She had a particular interest in books for Irish material and books for girls. This collection, known as the Pollard Collection, was bequeathed to the Library of Trinity College Dublin, along with her collecting notebooks.

Judge had previously written a memoir about his alcoholism titled Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk. If It Ain't Got That Swing chronicles the author's experimentation with swing dancing lessons, and his reluctance to do so due to his prior usage of alcohol as a way to relax himself in large social situations. Judge ascribes the 1996 film Swingers and a 1998 Gap Inc. commercial with youths dancing to the Lindy Hop as evidentiary of the swing revival. Judge criticizes the American culture of the 1960s and rock and roll, as forms of adolescence society in the United States. The book documents the author's shift from liberalism to support of right-wing politics. If It Ain't Got That Swing received negative book reviews from Library Journal, Kirkus Reviews, The Wall Street Journal, and Reason. Library Journal criticized the book's writing style and called it a \\"sophomoric, opinionated diatribe\\". Kirkus Reviews called it a \\"diatribe\\" and wrote that it failed due to \\"single-mindedness and humorlessness\\". The Wall Street Journal called Judge's argumentation \\"persuasive\\" but \\"incomplete\\", and pointed out inconsistencies in the book. Writing for Reason, Jesse Walker also found factual errors in Judge's work. Contents summary If It Ain't Got That Swing chronicles the author's transition from support of liberalism towards right-wing politics. Judge says he was influenced by the writings of Christopher Lasch, especially his work The Culture of Narcissism. The author's shift from left-wing politics to conservatism was additionally motivated by his initial foray into swing dancing. Judge examines the contemporary period of swing revival. The author recounts what he views as a subculture appreciative of rock and roll within American society which is devoid of any real meaning. Judge argues that this rock and roll culture is representative of an adolescent mentality. He criticizes changes which took place in the United States during the 1960s and praises cotillions as a way to return to an earlier period within American society. Judge writes that he himself took up swing dancing in the locality of Washington, D.C. in 1995. He describes for the reader the nervousness he felt while entering his first swing dance lesson, because he had previously relied upon alcoholic beverages as a way to make himself feel more comfortable in public gatherings. He charts the swing revival to two factors: the 1996 film Swingers, and a 1998 advertisement with youths performing the Lindy Hop while promoting Gap Inc. clothing. Judge pines for a culture in the United States reminiscent of more conservative ideology. Judge cites the adultery of Bill Clinton as evidence of a breakdown in contemporary societal values. He criticizes feminism and instead embraces a culture of chivalry. The author puts forth an argument that liberalism is hypocritical. Judge asserts that culture within the United States lacks organization, freedom, and connectedness. He argues that these qualities can be found in swing revival. Composition and publication Prior to writing If It Ain't Got That Swing, Judge had worked as a journalist in his early twenties. Before publishing If It Ain't Got That Swing, Judge had written Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk (1997). If It Ain't Got That Swing was first published in hardcover format in 2000, by Spence Publishing Company. An eBook was published by the same publisher in the same year. The author was interviewed on the NPR program Talk of the Nation in August 2000 about his book, and said that the 1996 film Swingers represented a resurgence of swing culture in the United States. By February 2001, Judge's book had become a bestseller in the United States. Judge subsequently published other books including Damn Senators, God and Man at Georgetown Prep (2005), and A Tremor of Bliss: Sex, Catholicism, and Rock 'n' Roll (2010). Critical reception If It Ain't Got That Swing received a negative book review from Library Journal, which observed the author advocated a society in the United States represented by Leave It To Beaver. The book review described the author's writing style as \\"meandering pages\\". The review concluded, \\"Displaying little knowledge or understanding of past or current American culture, Judge presents a sophomoric, opinionated diatribe that offers little to any reader.\\" Kirkus Reviews published a critical book review of If It Ain't Got That Swing, commenting that the author's writing style \\"has a tone of moral penitence and self-righteousness.\\" Kirkus Reviews concluded, \\"In the end, his diatribe comes to resemble a rant.\\" The book review characterized Judge's work as, \\"Ambitious pop-cult criticism that fails because of its single-mindedness and humorlessness.\\" Judge's work garnered a book review from The Wall Street Journal, which wrote of the author's argument that swing dancing could improve American culture: \\"There is much that is persuasive in this argument, but it is incomplete.\\" The review pointed out factual errors in Judge's writing, such as that dancing in public was curtailed after a U.S. tax on nightclubs in 1944. The Wall Street Journal pointed out that Judge's view of swing dancing as a way to improve civil discourse in American culture, led him to falsely conflate early swing dancing with a completely different later period of swing dancing culture. The Washington Post recommended the book, and classed it among others on the topic including Dance of Days, Our Band Could Be Your Life, and D.C. Hand Dance. Jesse Walker wrote a book review of If It Ain't Got That Swing, in an article for Reason. Walker wrote that Judge, \\"gets the genealogy of neo-swing wrong, and that he does so precisely because he's trying to reduce a complex phenomenon to a simple explanation.\\" Walker criticized Judge's \\"distorted chronology\\" about the evolution of the swing revival, citing factual inaccuracies in the presentation of swing dance history in the book. He said that the swing revival \\"obviously predated\\" the Gap Inc. commercial. He argued that Judge wrote from a stance of narcissism. The Reason book review concluded, \\"His new book's subtitle may invoke 'grown- up culture,' but his prose betrays him: He writes like he's going through a stage.\\" References Further reading * Category:2000 non-fiction books Category:American memoirs Category:American non-fiction books Category:Books by Mark Judge Category:Swing music ","title":"If It Ain't Got That Swing"},{"id":"58578082","title":"Pierpaolo Sileri"},{"id":"58578114","text":"Crikey!

Portion of Medeon's city wall still standing. Medeon () was a town of ancient Phocis, destroyed by Philip II of Macedon along with the other Phocian towns at the termination of the Third Sacred War (in 346 BCE), and never again restored. Strabo places it on the Crissaean Gulf, at the distance of 160 stadia from Boeotia; and Pausanias says that it was near Anticyra. An inscription is preserved dating from the 2nd century BCE regarding a political and religious union (sympoliteia) between Medeon and Stiris, in which both cities had the approval of the Phocian League. The agreement was inscribed on a stele inside the temple of Athena Cranea, in the city of Elateia. The stele preserves the name of the League's strategos, Zeuxis; in addition a sealed copy was to be guarded by a citizen of Lilaea named Trason and there were three persons who acted as witnesses from different Phocian cities: Tithorea, Elateia, and Lilaea. The union included the sanctuaries, the territory, the polis and the ports. From the formalization of the treaty the Medeonites will be with the Stirisians in conditions of equality and will have assemblies and common magistrates. It is not a complete merger of both cities: Stiris is the main city but the citizens of Medeon could designate a hierotamias who would make sacrifices according to the law of Medeon and who would have judicial competency together with the archons of Stiris and could vote. Those who have been magistrates in Medeon will not be required to be so in Stiris unless they decided voluntarily. The administration of the Medeonite sanctuaries will be carried out according to the law of Medeon, and the territory will be common. Remains of the beehive tomb found at Medeon. Medon's location is at a hill site called Agioi Theodoroi. The first excavations on the hill were carried out by Georgios Sotiriadis in 1907. Subsequently the site was re-excavated during the 1960s. An ancient cemetery has been found that remained in use from the Middle Heladic period (2100-1600 BCE) until the 2nd century BCE. A beehive tomb (tholos) with a small side room has also been discovered.

It is made from Killas rubble with five semi-circular arches having parapets with chamfered granite coping stones. A number of tram and railway lines were constructed to transport granite and slate between Dartmoor and Plymouth. The last line to be built was the South Devon and Tavistock Railway upon which Isambard Kingdom Brunel worked. It was taken over by the Great Western Railway and closed in 1962. It is now called Drake's Trail and is used as a footpath and cycle route through the woodland. There are remains of the quarrying history including the shell of old buildings used by families involved in the industry. A section of the trail passes Cann Viaduct. Nature The site is home to many species typical of English woodland, including a herd of fallow deer. There are goosanders, mandarin ducks, kingfishers and dippers along the river.

The producer was immediately enthusiastic but was unsure about the title. He suggested to rebaptise the film Le Squale (after the nickname of the main character), but the authors preferred to retain the original title. Jean-Marie Poir√© had great difficulty getting the project started because of his recent failure with Mes meilleurs copains. = Casting = G√©rard Depardieu was initially asked to play \\"Le Squale\\", though in the end he refused. (he nevertheless shot Les Anges gardiens with Jean-Marie Poir√© and Christian Clavier 4 years later). Other actors were considered, such as Daniel Auteuil (who was shooting Lacenaire), Thierry Lhermitte, G√©rard Lanvin, Pierre Arditi Gilles Botineau, Christian Clavier, Splendid Carri√®re!, Christian Navarro editions, 2016, preface by Patrice Leconte, , and Bernard Giraudeau. Marie-Anne Chazel, companion of Christian Clavier, who suggested Jean Reno for the role of \\"Le Squale\\". The producer Alain Terzian, in an interview with Premi√®re, narrated the hiring of Jean Reno: Jean-Marie Poir√© believes in this duo, mixing two different generations, that of Le Splendid (with Christian Clavier) and that of The Big Blue (with Jean Reno). Catherine Jacob had to refuse the part of Marie-Laurence Granianski because she was already cast in Merci la vie, directed by Bertrand Blier. Ironically, she received a C√©sar Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress alongside Val√©rie Lemercier who was cast as Marie-Laurence Granianski. Carole Bouquet was also approached for the role. It was Fran√ßoise Menidrey, a casting director, who suggested that Jean-Marie Poir√© and Alain Terzian see a performance of the play Un fil √† la patte at the Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal and paying attention to one of the secondary actresses, Val√©rie Lemercier: Poir√© and Terzian were In the play and she was hired for the film. This film marks the first collaboration of the quartet Poir√©‚ÄìClavier‚ÄìReno‚ÄìLemercier, who were reunited in Les Visiteurs two years later, in 1993. Many young actresses auditioned for the role of Isabelle Fourreau. Poir√© finally chose Isabelle Renauld who was at the beginning of her career. To represent the President of the Republic, a character only seen from behind in the film, a \\"casting of skulls\\" was made to find an actor whose head looked closest to that of Fran√ßois Mitterrand. = Shooting =  Stunts  Initially, the scenes taking place aboard the Citro√´n BX had to be made on a voiture travelling, as is generally done in movies. The actor pretends to drive the vehicle. However, in these conditions, the travelling car can only roll at low speed and this posed problems during the shooting of the scene on the national road, where the BX is supposed to roll at 140 km / h. The car travelling slowly, they were overtaken by trucks that honked at them or flashed their lights, which made the filming impossible. Jean Reno himself made the decision to actually drive the BX 140 km/h on the national, among the flow of normal traffic, with a remote camera attached to the hood of the car and the sound recording equipment installed in the trunk. Also, with Jean Reno performing some \\"simple\\" stunts at the wheel of the BX, the fears of Christian Clavier as a passenger were real.  Cars  Filming of a scene with Jean Reno, Christian Clavier and the Citro√´n BX 16 TGS, colour Rouge Delage. The film honors the Citro√´n range of the moment, where several contemporary models of the brand appear in stars throughout this comedy (AX, BX, XM, CX EVASION Ambulance, C 25). All cars were loaned by Citro√´n: A Citro√´n XM similar to the one used by G√©n√©ral Masse * The Citro√´n BX Jean-Jacques Granianski (Christian Clavier) is a BX 16 TGS model 1990 Red Delage color.Operation Corned-Beef on the Internet Movie Cars Database. For the purposes of the film, no less than six BXs were used: a new BX with 2,000 km on the clock was used for \\"calm\\" scenes and on-board shots and, for the eventful or waterfall scenes, five other older cars have been made up to look like new. We see especially during the scene in the sunflower field that the BX used for this sequence is an older because its interior is brown while it is gray in the new BX. * The Citro√´n XM of General Masse (Jacques Fran√ßois) - that is offered Jean-Jacques Granianski (Christian Clavier) at the end of the film, in compensation for the destruction of his BX brand new by the Squale (Jean Reno) - is an XM V6 finish \\"Ambiance\\" model 1990, pearl gray metallic varnished color. To note a small mistake of shooting: during the first scene with this XM, where is established a discussion between the Squale and General Masse, we can notice that the passenger seat and the passenger door panel of the car are velvet gray, unlike the driver's seat which is black leather. * The van Citro√´n C25 of General Moulin (Jacques Dacqmine) is a C25E Combi Comfort model 1987, metallic Satellite Gray color varnished.  Filming locations  The scenes supposed to take place in Colombia were actually shot in Mexico. During a scene, the Mexican flag is visible on a building. The Saviem SM 7 truck of occupational medicine, which acts as a \\"submarine\\" for DGSE agents, is parked in front of 74 avenue d'I√©na at Paris, in the 16th arrondissement, near the Arc de Triomphe. On his arrival to visit his wife Marie-Laurence (Val√©rie Lemercier) at the Consulate, Jean-Jacques Granianski (Christian Clavier) parks his Citro√´n BX in front of 74 avenue de Jena. The Consulate is located opposite rue Auguste-Vacquerie. When Le Squale (Jean Reno) returned to Paris by plane from Colombia, he landed at Orly West Airport. Later in the film, we find this airport when Le Squale accompanies Graninski for a weekend in Venice with Maryline. The scenes where the Citro√´n BX rolls on the national road with Jean Reno and Christian Clavier on board take place on Route nationale 12 between the communes of Cherisy and Houdan. The scenes taking place at the home of the Granianski are supposed to happen at Dreux, at the fictional address \\"24 avenue du Paris, residence Pompadour\\". In reality, the shooting took place on All√©e des Terres Neuves in Croissy-sur-Seine. The scene where the old lady enters the portal of a hospice was shot in Theuville, in the Val-d'Oise. The Citro√´n XM of General Masse (Jacques Fran√ßois) is parked in the underground parking George V, Avenue George V in Paris 8th arrondissement. When Le Squale (Jean Reno) and Aspirant Garcia (Mireille Rufel) return to Paris after the explosion of the Granianski BX, and after abandoning it in the middle of the countryside, they park the SEAT Marbella level 41 avenue George V, at the time before Bank Herv√© (now replaced by an Armani store). In the background, we can see a poster of the film Bienvenue √† bord!, a French film by Jean-Louis Leconte with Pierre Richard and Martin Lamotte, released in September 1990. Scenes are then shot at the Hotel Prince de Galles. For the end of the film, many scenes were shot in the Parc Ast√©rix and on its parking lot. A particular scene takes place on the aquatic attraction named at the time \\"The Descent of the Styx\\". = Dubbing = Fran√ßois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl Didier Gustin, at that time little known, imitates Fran√ßois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl in a short scene, as they appear only from the back. = Music = Music for the film was composed by Eric L√©vi, former member - and founder - of the group Shakin' Street, whose song \\"Solid As Rock\\", written by Fabienne Shine, appears in the film. The main song of the film, \\"Passion For War / Love\\", was written by R. Stone and √âric L√©vi and sung by Joan Paladin (Joan Peltz). The album containing the music from the film, titled simply Bande Originale du Film L'Op√©ration Corned-Beef, was released the same year as the film. ; Credits  Release  = Promotion = The trailer shows images from the film accompanied by a voice-over from Jean Reno (playing the role of Le Squale), sending an audio message to *My Dear Georges\\": = Reception = Val√©rie Lemercier's performance was nominated for the C√©sar Award for Best Supporting Actress in the 17th C√©sar Awards. She did not win the C√©sar but two years later received it for her dual role in Les Visiteurs, Jean-Marie Poir√©'s next film. = Box office = L‚ÄôOp√©ration Corned Beef was placed 15th in the Box-office France 1991, with admissions.

However, because he speaks German, the red and white color of the flag fluttering on the facade of the consulate, and the Tyrolean uniforms of the staff, it is easy to assume that he is the Austrian consul.

His other research interests included gifted education, literacy, vocational education, and the psychology of eyewitness testimony. A 1997 article about giftedness described Whipple as \\"an all-but- forgotten pioneer in this field\\". Whipple was born on June 12, 1876 in Danvers, Massachusetts, to John Francis Whipple and Cornelia Eliza Whipple (n√©e Hood). He received his A.B. degree from Brown University in 1897. He then worked at Clark University for a year before joining Cornell University in 1898, where he worked as an assistant in psychology until 1902. He received his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1900 under the supervision of Edward B. Titchener, who gained a negative impression of Whipple's interest in psychology during this time. He went on to join the faculty of the University of Illinois in 1914 before joining the University of Michigan, where he was Professor of Experimental Education from 1919 to 1925. Whipple was a founding member of the advisory committee for the Division of Applied Psychology at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now known as Carnegie Mellon University), as well as one of four founding editors of the Journal of Educational Psychology. He also served alongside Lewis Terman as a member of the American Psychological Association's Committee on the Psychological Examination of Recruits, which helped to develop the Army Alpha and Beta tests used on American soldiers during World War I. He was the editor of elementary school textbooks for D. C. Heath and Company from 1928 to 1937. He died in Clifton, Massachusetts on August 1, 1941, after a brief illness.

Premise Bless the Harts follows a working-class family living in North Carolina. The main protagonist, waitress Jenny Hart, struggles to make ends meet. Her artistically talented daughter Violet Hart and mother Betty Hart live with her along with her boyfriend Wayne, and there are other recurring characters also in the series. The show's creator Emily Spivey has stated that it is based on her life growing up in High Point, North Carolina and is set in the state's Triad region. The name of the show's fictional town, Greenpoint, is a portmanteau of Greensboro and High Point. Bless the Harts loosely shares a universe with the Fox series King of the Hill, which ran from 1997‚Äì2009. Spivey cites King of the Hill as her major influence for creating Bless the Harts. The fictional superstore Mega-Lo-Mart, first introduced in King of the Hill, makes several appearances in Bless the Harts.

The second season premiered on September 27, 2020. This upcoming season will consist of 22 episodes, and two additional episodes produced will be either heldover for a potential third season or burned off should the series be cancelled. Season 2 was produced during the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted many other television productions, but left animated production largely unaffected.

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"With an exceptional cast and a big heart to boot, Bless the Harts particular worldview won't be for everyone, but it fits quite nicely into Fox's Animation Domination line-up\\". On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Bubbleblabber gave the first season a 6 out of 10, stating \\"this first season most definitely has more misses than hits in its line up which three more episodes likely wouldn‚Äôt have helped at this point. With this extra time to work on these and future episodes while taking in reception from this season, I think the next will really benefit in the long term. Plus, it gets the rare honor of being a new Fox animated show that actually GOT a second season, which has not happened since Bob's Burgers got its first renewal at the start of the decade. Fox is thinking outside the box to keep its adult animation thriving, which hopefully means more chances for exploration in future seasons. I‚Äôll tell you what, these Harts are quite blessed to be given the chance to be Fox‚Äôs next enduring animated series.\\" The Parents Television Council, a frequent critic of Fox Broadcasting Company animated comedies like Family Guy, gave the first episode a negative review. =Ratings= Seasons Season 1 Season 2 Notes References External links  Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:2010s American sitcoms Category:2010s American adult animated television series Category:2010s American satirical television series Category:2020s American sitcoms Category:2020s American adult animated television series Category:2020s American satirical television series Category:American animated sitcoms Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:Animated television series about dysfunctional families Category:Animated television series about teenagers Category:English- language television shows Category:Fox Broadcasting Company original programming Category:Portrayals of Jesus on television Category:Television series by Fox Television Animation Category:Television series by 20th Century Fox Television Category:Television series by Fox Entertainment Category:Television shows set in North Carolina Category:Television series about suburbia Category:Television series created by Emily Spivey ","title":"Bless the Harts"},{"id":"58578710","text":"Yevgeniya Nikolayevna Sinskaya (1889-1965) was a Russian botanist noted for her research in plant taxonomy, phytogeography, species formation, and genetics.

One of the founders of the Oromia Media Network (OMN), Jawar was a leading organizer of the 2016 Ethiopian protests and when returned to his home country on 5 August 2018, he was treated like royalty. and the key intellectual inspiration for the International Oromo Youth Association (National Youth Movement for Freedom and Democracy), popularly known as Qeerroo (\\"Youth\\"). Jawar, an exiled activist in Minnesota helped spur big political changes in Ethiopia. he has credited to topple the previous government by organizing Qeerroo leading resignations of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn in February 2018. Early life and education Jawar Mohammed was born on 12 May 1986 in the small town of Dhumuga, Arsi Province bordering Hararghe. His father was Muslim Arsi Oromo while his mother was an Orthodox Christian Tulama Oromo; their inter-religious union was considered novel but was ultimately accepted by the community. Jawar began his formal education at a Catholic school in Asella former capital of the Arsi Province. He then attended secondary school in Adama until 2003, when he was awarded a scholarship to study at the United World College of South East Asia in Singapore, from which he graduated in 2005. He described his experience at the UWC as awakening his consciousness to his own Oromo identity. He then studied at Stanford University, graduating in 2009 with a degree in political science. He went on to pursue graduate studies in human rights at Columbia University, receiving a master's degree in 2012. Activism A street was named after Jawar Mohammed in Asella in which he in surprise commenced the ceremony. In 2006, while a student at Stanford, Jawar founded the International Oromo Youth Association (IOYA), intended to serve as an umbrella organization for Oromo youth groups around the world. The IOYA has engaged in advocacy in front of United Nations bodies in Geneva and held demonstrations to protest Ethiopian government policy. Jawar first gained prominence as a writer and speaker on Oromo and Ethiopian politics, chiefly amongst the US-based diaspora. He was a notable critic of the Oromo Liberation Front and their perceived failure to effect meaningful political change in Ethiopia or to advance Oromo interests. Jawar has been an important political coordinator for the Qeerroo youth movement, even in exile. Qeerroo ‚Äì young Oromo activists ‚Äì drove the mass strike that helped topple the prime minister of one of Africa‚Äôs most autocratic governments. Bekele Gerba, the opposition leader, credits the Qeerroo with securing his release from prison, and for sending hundreds of well-wishers to his home in Adama in the aftermath. During the Oromo Protests, State security forces in Ethiopia have used excessive and lethal force against largely peaceful protests that have swept through Oromia, the country‚Äôs largest region, since November 2015. Over 400 people are estimated to have been killed, thousands injured, tens of thousands arrested, and hundreds, likely more, have been victims of enforced disappearances. The protests began on November 12, 2015, in Ginchi, a small town 80 kilometers southwest of Ethiopia‚Äôs capital, Addis Ababa, which is surrounded by the Oromia, home to most of Ethiopia‚Äôs estimated 35 million Oromo, the country‚Äôs largest ethnic group. The decision of authorities in Ginchi to clear a forest and football field for an investment project triggered protests in at least 400 different locations across all the 17 zones in Oromia. Security forces, according to witnesses, shot into crowds, summarily killing people during mass roundups, and torturing detained protesters. Because primary and secondary school students in Oromia were among the early protesters, many of those arrested or killed were children under the age of 18. It documents the most significant patterns of human rights violations during the Oromo protests from late 2015 until May 2016. Respected opposition leader Bekele Gerba is one of 23 senior members of the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC), a legally registered political party, who have been charged under the counterterrorism law after spending four months in detention. The Ethiopian government has also increased its efforts to restrict media freedom ‚Äì already dire in Ethiopia ‚Äì and block access to information in Oromia. In March, the government began restricting access to social media sites in the region, apparently because Facebook and other social media platforms have been key avenues for the dissemination of information. The government has also jammed diaspora-run television stations, such as the US-based Oromia Media Network (OMN), and destroyed private satellite dishes at homes and businesses. Students in Oromia, Ethiopia‚Äôs largest regional state, have been demonstrating against the government's so- called developmental ‚ÄúMaster Plan‚Äù to expand the area of the capital, Addis Ababa, into Oromia. Students and other citizens, along with many Ethiopians living abroad, believe the move will result in direct persecution of the Oromo ethnic group, which has been systematically marginalized by the government over the last two decades, despite representing Ethiopia's largest ethnic group. One of the rally is the Oromo grand protest across 200 cities in Oromia including its capital city Finfinne in August 2016. Following the escalated protests, Ethiopian government censored internet, and satellite TV channels and accused him for leading the protest. The government also carried out cyber-attack against him. After his interview with Aljazeera, in which he replied \\"I am Oromo first\\" for the question \\"Are you Oromo first or Ethiopian first?\\" Although his answer was a view of millions of Oromos, some Ethiopians have started campaign and requested Aljazeera to fire the journalist. In August 2018, Jawar returned to Ethiopia as a hero. He had last been there in 2008. The government of Abiy Ahmed, an Oromo from the ruling coalition, dropped all terrorism charges against him, and Jawar transformed from an outside agitator, an activist, to a political figure with huge influence over the new government. Thousands of people lined the Addis Ababa streets, celebrating his return. Addis Ababa is in the heartland of the Oromia region and is one of the places where Jawar's theories about political activism came to life. In October 2019, he reported that, late at night, members of the police had attempted to force his security detail to vacate the grounds of his home in Addis Ababa; alleging they planned to later mobilize a mob and intimating they were doing so at the behest of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. The previous day, the prime minister gave a speech in parliament in which he accused \\"media owners who don‚Äôt have Ethiopian passports\\" of \\"playing it both ways,\\" a thinly-veiled reference to Jawar, adding that \\"if this is going to undermine the peace and existence of Ethiopia... we will take measures.\\" The reports sparked nationwide clashes by the Qeerroo, leaving at least 67 people dead, including five police officers. After weeks of clashes had ended, Abiy said Most were from the Oromo and Amhara ethnic groups and victims included both Muslims and Christians and the death toll had risen to 86. = Arrest = On June 30 2020, Jawar was arrested by Ethiopian Federal police after an incident between Jawar's guards and police that resulted in the death of a police officer. The incident happened when Jawar and his guards intercepted the transportation of the corpse of Hachalu Hundessa, a popular Oromo singer who was murdered, to his home town of Ambo, that lies 100 km west of Addis Ababa. Jawar wanted to have the funeral in Addis Ababa while Hachalu's parents and wife wanted to have the burial in Ambo. 35 people, including Jawar, were apprehended along with eight Kalashnikovs, five pistols and nine radio transmitters. Jawar was initially detained at Addis Ababa Police Commission premises and later found at an underground cell at an unofficial detention location near the Federal Police headquarters in Mexico Square on 14 July. On 19 September 2020, Ethiopia has charged its most prominent opposition figure, Jawar Mohammed, and 23 others with terrorism-related offenses, telecom fraud and other crimes, the attorney general‚Äôs office announced Saturday. They will appear in court on Monday. The charges relate to deadly violence that erupted in July in parts of the capital, Addis Ababa, Oromia region after the killing of singer Hachalu Hundessa, a prominent voice in anti-government protests that led to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed coming to power in 2018. Jawar, a media mogul-turned-politician, has huge support among youth in the Oromia region and returned to Ethiopia after Abiy took office and urged exiles to come home amid sweeping political reforms that led to him receiving the Nobel Peace Prize last year. The Oromo makeup Ethiopia‚Äôs largest ethnic group but had never held the country‚Äôs top post until they helped bring Abiy to power. Jawar has been detained since he and several thousand people were arrested during the July violence. His lawyers have repeatedly asserted he was locked up because of his political views and have called for his release. His lawyer Tuli Bayissa told The Associated Press that the charges astonished the legal team, and he couldn‚Äôt comment on them because he found out only by reading the official announcement on social media. ‚ÄúThis is unethical. I haven‚Äôt heard anything like this,‚Äù he said. He expects to receive details at Monday‚Äôs court appearance. Human rights groups have warned that such arrests show that Abiy‚Äôs political reforms are slipping. Youth in Oromia have staged a number of recent protests calling for the release of political prisoners, including one in late August that left ‚Äúscores‚Äù of people dead, according to the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission and witnesses who spoke to the AP. The prime minister also acknowledged alleged abuses by security forces during the bouts of unrest, saying that ‚Äúgiven the institutions we have inherited, we realize that law- enforcement activities entail a risk of human-rights violations and abuse.‚Äù Security reforms take time, he said.

It was designed by Nyoman Nuarta and inaugurated in September 2018. The total height of the monument, including the 46-meter base pedestal is . The statue is about higher than the Statue of Liberty, but Liberty is tall and thin, while Garuda is almost as wide as it is high ‚Äî its wingspan is . The statue was designed to be the Indonesia‚Äôs tallest statue, that was inspired by a Hindu about the search for Amrita (the elixir of life). According to this myth, Garuda agreed to be ridden by Vishnu in return for the right to use the elixir to liberate his enslaved mother. The monument was completed on 31 July 2018 and inaugurated by Indonesian President Joko Widodo on 22 September, 2018. The crown of Vishnu is covered with golden mosaics. History It took twenty- eight years and around $100 million to build the statue. GWK was designed back in 1990 by Nyoman Nuarta under the auspices of then-Tourism Minister Joop Ave, Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana and Governor of Bali Ida Bagus Oka. The groundbreaking event of the statue‚Äôs construction took place 1997. In the late 1990s, the project was brought to a sudden halt by the combining force of the global economic crisis. Construction resumed in 2013 after a sixteen year hiatus, when property developer PT. Alam Sutera Realty Tbk (ASR) agreed to financing the construction of the statue and the project. The idea for the monument was not without controversy; religious authorities on the island complained that its massive size might disrupt the spiritual balance of the island, and that its commercial nature was inappropriate, but some groups agree with the project, because it will be a new tourist attraction. Fabrication and dimensions The statue was assembled in Bali from 754 discrete modules that were constructed in Bandung, West Java and then transported to the work site. The modules were cut into 1,500 smaller pieces to accommodate the cranes maximum load. The last piece that was placed onto the gigantic artwork was at its tail, which is located at the highest point of the statue. Garuda's shape is so complex that engineers have designed special joints in the supporting structure, with up to 11 enormous steel girders coming together at the same point, whereas normal construction joints have four or six girders. The Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue is designed to withstand storms and earthquakes, and expected to last for the next 100 years. The completed monument is about as tall as a 21-storey building. It weighs 4000 tonnes, making it the heaviest statue in Indonesia. The artwork is made of copper and brass supported by 21,000 steel bars, and bolts of 170,000. The statue is made of copper and brass sheeting, with a stainless steel frame and skeleton, as well as a steel and concrete core column. The outer covering measures in area. The crown of Vishnu is covered with golden mosaics and the statue has a dedicated lighting arrangement. The sculpture sits atop a building base which will function as a restaurant, museum, and viewing gallery.

After Wright wore a brooch given to her by General Sheridan in early 1867, her Confederate-sympathizing sister told a reporter its provenance. The resulting newspaper article led to social ostracism of Rebecca Wright and a boycott of the boarding house her mother ran with her daughters' help, and forced them to move to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Denied a soldier's pension because of her sex despite the efforts of Congressman Thaddeus Stevens and General Sheridan, eventually Wright accepted a clerical job at the U.S. Treasury Department and moved to Washington, D.C., where she married a Union veteran, and worked until shortly before her death.Marianne Monson, Women of the Blue & Gray (Shadow Mountain Press, 2018) pp. 58-60 Early life Rebecca Wright was the oldest surviving child of furniture manufacturer Amos Wright (1802-1864) and his wife Rachel (1810-1874). The Wright family were members of the Hopewell Meeting (a/k/a \\"Opequon Meeting\\") and thus did not own slaves. Young Rebecca was educated in Winchester, as well as for a year at the Friends School in nearby Loudoun County run by Samuel Janney. During the 1850 federal census, the family included three younger brothers and a young sister,1850 U.S. Federal Census, Frederick County, Virginia, family 1074 By 1860, the older boys (subject to conscription) no longer resided with them. The Wright household in 1860 only included Amos, his wife, daughters, son John (aged 9) and a domestic servant, as well as two other families (a coachmaker, his wife and infant son, and a hatter, his wife and teen-aged daughter).1860 U.S. Federal Census for Winchester, Frederick County Virginia, family no. 795 American Civil War Rebecca Wright began teaching children when she was 15 years old, and during the three years before the American Civil War taught at the Hopewell Meeting's school, as well as assisted at Powell's Academy (a private school). Winchester changed hands 75 times in the four wartime years, including as a result of three major battles which occurred nearby. However, most townspeople sympathized with the Confederacy. In March 1862, Confederate troops arrested her father Amos Wright (a leading Union sympathizer, as well as secession opponent the previous year) and brought him into town, along with Smith Gilkeson and Jason Rea, and some feared they would be lynched.Michael G.

On September 16, 1864, General Sheridan sent Tom Laws, an elderly black slave from Millwood, Virginia who had a Confederate permit to sell produce in Winchester three days a week, to contact the fired schoolteacher at her Winchester home. She conveyed information about General Early's forces which a Confederate officer had publicly bragged about the previous day, namely that Confederate infantry and artillery battalions had left town.Frank Leslie, et al. The American Magazine, Volume 73 Roger U. Delauter, Jr. Winchester in the Civil War (H.E. Howard, Inc., The Virginia Civil War Battles and Leaders Series; 2d edition 1992) p. 78 Acting on that information, Sheridan engaged Early's forces near Opequon Creek in which proved to be the second bloodiest battle in the Shenandoah Valley. By the sunset on September 19, 1864, Early's army had been routed: of 14,500 Confederate troops, 2,000 had been killed or wounded, 1800 men were missing and three important brigade commanders had been killed (General Robert E. Rodes, Colonels Archibald C. Godwin, George S. Patton Sr. and John H. S. Funk). Union forces suffered over 5,000 casualties, but those 40,000 troops could only fail to account for 500 men.DeLauter p. 80 Generals Sheridan and Crook attempted to thank Wright for her assistance after the victory, but she urged confidentiality, fearing retaliation. General Sheridan would pursue Early's retreating army, and again defeat it at Fisher's Hill on September 22, and yet again, even more bloodily, at the Battle of Cedar Creek on October 19.Delauter pp. 82-83 By mid-November the Winchester and Potomac Railroad had resumed service from Harper's Ferry to Stephenson's Depot, allowing the Federals a secure supply line, and Winchester had become the Union army's winter quarters would not again change hands.Delauter p. 85 Later life  In 1867, Sheridan learned of the Wright ladies' financial distress and sent Rebecca Wright a pocket watch and elegant brooch, as well as a recommendation from General Ulysses S.

Neighbors then boycotted the Wrights' boarding house and boys spat at Rebecca in the street, so the Wright women moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Congressman Thaddeus Stevens proposed a special bill to allow Wright a federal pension, but failed to secure its passage, other members objecting on account of her sex. Rebecca Wright eventually accepted the job offer, moved to Washington, D.C. the following July, and remained a federal civil servant for 47 years.Monson p. 68 She married William Bonsal, a veteran of the 16th Pennsylvania Cavalry in 1871, and financed his purchase of a farm in Kansas, but successive poor crops led him to return to Washington, D.C.Mary Elizabeth Massey, Women in the Civil War p. 135 available at https://books.google.com/books?id=iMOXnAboxV4C&pg;=PA135&lpg;= Death and legacy Rebecca Wright Bonsal retired from her federal job shortly before her death in 1914.

Some armed forces such as the Australian fully embrace intersex people in modern-day while others have vague rules or policies or treat the subject on a case by case basis, such as the United States. History In the late 1800s, military medical examinations became a driving force in increased detection and diagnosis of intersex individuals. Views The 2014 book Operative Pediatric Surgery states that \\"societies that have accepted intersex individuals culturally may still have issues with whether or not to accept them in the military\\", this being due to the difficulties in determining where to place them as well as the complex medical issues they may pose.Operative Pediatric Surgery - Page 901 In 2007 the US-based Palm Center released a report that found that most of the militaries beliefs about transgender and intersex medical requirements were myths and posed no barrier to effective service. By country =United States= Accepting of intersex people in the United States Armed Forces appears to vary depending on the nature of the condition of the individual people. Publications by the United States National Center for Biotechnology Information recommends that intersex individuals be allowed to serve in the armed forces, but not combat units. The Veterans Health Administration distinguishes between surgeries for transgender individuals and intersex persons. In 2015 this allowed intersex persons to receive medically necessary treatment that was prohibited for transgender people. =Israel= Officially, Israel Defense Forces policy does not prohibit intersex patients' draft but does exclude some people based on intersex status.https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3929003,00.html The Military Medicine journal estimated in 2008 that there should be expected to be about \\"a few dozen\\" intersex persons serving in the Israel Defense Forces at that time and that it is probable that most intersex persons service closeted since it is underreported comparatively to the general population. According to the publication this is most likely caused by shame or secrecy. One reported case of an intersex woman was found where the woman's status was not discovered until military medical investigation, she was initially drafted to a combat unit and served successfully, but was later transferred to a non-combat unit where she also completed her service successfully. It was also discovered that her older sister who served in a fully in a non-combat unit also was intersex, as was their younger sister who was yet to be drafted. =Australia= A report from 2017 by ABC Online stated that intersex personnel of the Australian Defence Force have had their history and contributions largely scrubbed out, much like other queer people and that their history was still being attempted to be rediscovered. During the \\"25 years of diversity\\" celebration for the armed forces intersex people were honored and included with other queer people. In their 2018 book Serving in Silence? Noah Riseman, Shirleene Robinson and Graham Willett acknowledged the lack of perspective and representation from intersex people in their work, they account for this by explaining that the Australian Defence Force never had official policies regarding intersex people and that it was purely considered a medical condition which would mean that the nature of it would determine if someone was allowed to serve, but either as a man or woman regardless, and the fact that the one intersex person they were able to interview provided them with content which they felt was too sensitive to share.Serving in Silence?: Australian LGBT servicemen and women Foreword In 2016 the first ADF policy regarding intersex and non-binary people was put in use, it states that they are allowed to sign as \\"intersex\\", \\"indeterminate\\" or unspecified\\" on their papers.Beyond Combat: Australian military life off the battlefield; - page 43 Australia allows both non-binary trans people and intersex servicemen to use \\"X\\" on their papers as well.https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national- affairs/defence/cadet-x-clears-a-path-for-genderneutral-aussie-soldiers/news- story/be3c65f590aab3b1e8e9c02cdddfd108?nk=c807dc40e23e132b6ccc72b2a8d91674-1538002899http://aph.org.au/historic- lgbt-discharges-apology-and-redress/ DEFGLIS is the most well known organisation of the Regular, Reserve and Civilian members of the Australian Defence Organisation for those who are homosexual, bisexual, intersex and transgender, as well as their allies.http://www.defence.gov.au/FOI/Docs/Disclosures/009_1718_Documents.pdf =South Korea= Intersex service people of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces are subject to supplemental urological examinations, this was first introduced due to transgender people but is also meant to clear up the status of intersex individuals to the military leaders.

One noted case was in 1954 with the soldier Xie Jianshun who was originally assigned as a male at birth but was later discovered in the military to have many female characteristics. Xie had a penis but a very slim vaginal opening as well as internal gonads which contained both testicular and ovarian tissue, doctors determined that they could still produce eggs and that Xie's testicular tissue was deteriorating. Military doctors performed four surgeries despite Xie's desire to remain a man, afterwards Xie left the armed forces.Sexuality in China: Histories of Power and Pleasure; 138 =Thailand= In the past the exclusion or inclusion of Intersex people presented a difficult task for the Royal Thai Armed Forces which have at times expected both transvestites and male assigned transgender people to be eligible for draftinghttps://www.astraeafoundation.org/location/thailand/ despite how many feminine traits they have, but were unsure how to handle intersex people since many of them despite their male traits may not have been assigned as male at birth.

If a male person was found to be developing breasts they could be excluded even if they had no visible genital abnormalities. The military composed several regulations to determine who was deemed unfit for service based on their genitals.Bodies, Sex and Desire from the Renaissance to the Present In modern-day the Spanish Armed Forces accepts intersex personnel. =Vietnam= One of the most well known intersex military people is L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát.

McLelland; Queer Japan from the Pacific War to the Internet Age - Page 208 =Iran= Since the first half of the 20th century intersex people who were assigned male at birth and had surgery to correct any issues were allowed to serve and intersex persons assigned female at birth could also serve if they choose to transition to male and have surgery.Afsaneh Najmabadi; Professing Selves: Transsexuality and Same-Sex Desire in Contemporary Iran - Page 46 = Russia = According to the laws of the Russian Federation, only people with a male gender marker in a passport are eligible for drafting. People with a female gender marker in the passport can serve in the army at will. At the same time, there are a number of medical restrictions, in accordance with which military service can be prohibited or restricted. Such restrictions include those that may be manifestations of intersex traits (such as vaginal atresia, absence of the penis, cryptorchidism, amenorrhea).

Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics =Archean= Archean rocks dominate much of the territory's surface and places with overlying rock. Greenstone belts are common together with migmatite gneiss, granodiorite, and quartz monzonite, on the Melville Peninsula and northern Baffin Island, as well as the southwest mainland. Lenses and bands of amphibolite, granitoid and metasedimentary rocks are common in these areas, along with less common ultramafic rocks. Gold and other base metals are widespread as mineralization in siliclastic, felsic, mafic and ironstone rocks of the greenstone belts. The George Lake, Boston and Ulu deposits are all hosted in the Yellowknife Supergroup of the Slave Craton in the west as well as the Lupin gold mine. In the western Churchill Province of south-central Nunavut are the Noomut, Heninga Lake and Meliadine gold deposits, and the Victory Lake and Ferguson Lake base metals deposits. Ultramafic volcanic rocks, quartzite and iron formations in the northern Churchill Province hold the Woodhurn, Prince Albert and Meadowbank gold deposits. The Churchill Province experienced widespread metamorphism 2.5 billion years ago. Baffin Island represents the eastern margin of the Canadian Shield and the long-term thermal history of southern Baffin suggests temperatures remained high (above 400C) following Trans-Hudson Orogeny peak metamorphism at c. 1.85 billion years ago, slow cooling and minor reheating ensued throughout the Proterozoic, followed by episodic sedimentary burial during the Paleozoic through Mesozoic of <3-4 km. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= Paleozoic rocks cover one-third of the territory, northwest of Fury and Hecla Strait, forming part of the Arctic Platform and continuing north to Ellesmere Island. In the southeast, they are continuation of the Hudson Platform beneath the Foxe Basin. Subsidence and craton rifting are recorded in Cambrian strata, with clastic sequences left by a marine transgression. A stable platform developed from the Cambrian through the Silurian and thick carbonates with high oil and gas potential deposited. The Caledonian orogeny brought uplift and erosion from the Silurian through the Early Devonian, generating potential red bed related copper deposits in a thick clastic wedge. The Ellesmerian orogeny produced Mississippi-valley type zinc-lead mineralization in the Polaris district of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Thick clastic and carbonate sediments deposited in the Sverdrup Basin in the north during the Carboniferous. =Proterozoic (2.5 billion-541 million years ago)= Hurwitz Group strata and other units from the Proterozoic cover much of the Churchill Province. Continental margin sediments deposited in central Baffin Island as the Piling Group and as the Penrhyn Group on the southern Melville Peninsula. The units include quartzite and feldspathic quartzite, overlain by dolomite, marble and gneiss, together with schist and iron formations with sulfur geochemistry. Gray, weathered psammitic rocks are common in the upper part of the basin, with high potential for base metals and gold. The former Black Angel zinc and lead mine is located within the Karrat Group carbonates on the coast of West Greenland. Ultramafic sills are found in the southern Baffin Island Lake Harbour Group. On the Belcher Islands in Hudson Bay are clastic rocks overlain by volcanic and carbonate rocks, which record subsidence and rifting at the western edge of the Superior Craton. Thermal overprinting and deformation from the Paleoproterozoic have been found in these rocks, dating to the Trans-Hudson Orogeny 1.8 billion years ago. The Bylot Supergroup in Baffin Island and Bylot Island is six kilometers thick with a combination of undeformed volcanic, clastic and carbonate rocks deposited during a phase of renewed rifting. The Borden Peninsula is divided into horst and graben structures by normal faults from local rifting and subsidence 1.27 billion years ago. The Nanisivik Mine extracts zinc and lead from these carbonates. The Bylot Supergroup is known as the Fury Group and Hecla Group along the Fury and Hecla Strait, where it overlies Archean and Paleoproterozoic rocks with nearly six kilometers of material, likely deposited over the span of 75 million years. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= Through the Cretaceous, sedimentation continued in the Sverdrup Basin, producing oil and gas forming conditions and Bent Horn light crude field. Rifting and alkaline volcanism in the Cretaceous began the process of siliclastic deposition in northern Baffin Island and northern Ellesmere Island. Diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes formed on Somerset Island, exposed along the Brodeur Peninsula and northwest Baffin Island. The Jericho diamond pipes are part of a northern continuation of Lac de Gras field in the northern Slave Province. There are also kimberlite pipes on Victoria Island. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= In the far north, compression and strike-slip faulting affected the Canadian Arctic Archipelago throughout the Eureakan orogeny. The tectonic event happened in parallel with the siliclastic sedimentation and opened Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea. https://instruct.uwo.ca/earth-sci/300b-001/seg/scott.htm References ","title":"Geology of Nunavut"},{"id":"58579205","text":"David Gerald is an American blues rock musician.

The United States Armed Forces as a whole does not officially ban intersex people from service but does exclude many based on the form of their status. Policies regarding all intersex people are not addressed formally although depending on the type of sex variation some intersex people are allowed to serve. History When the skeleton of Casimir Pulaski, a famed American Revolutionary War general, was exhumed and studied, several female features were found which led to speculation that Pulaski was likely intersex.https://www.connectsavannah.com/savannah/pondering- pulaski/Content?oid=5847159 https://archive.today/20181211150201/https://www.connectsavannah.com/savannah/pondering- pulaski/Content?oid=5847159https://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20050622/dna- from-pulaski-monument-inconclusive https://web.archive.org/web/20181211150508/https://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20050622/dna- from-pulaski-monument- inconclusivehttps://today.emich.edu/magazine/article/10654 https://archive.today/20181211150704/https://today.emich.edu/magazine/article/10654https://web.archive.org/web/20181129125909/https://pages.uoregon.edu/healarts/studies/alternatives/Alt%20PDFs/Hermaphrodites_Reis.pdf Between 1905 and 1945, the term \\"hermaphroditism\\" was used as a general term to refer to several urological conditions which made someone unable to enrol as a cadet at West Point Military Academy.Information Relative to the Appointment and Admission of Cadets to the United States Military Academy, West Point, N.Y. Barring of people with actual \\"hermaphroditic\\" diagnosable medical conditions dates back at least as far back as 1951.1951; Catalog of the U.S. Military Academy - Page 148 In 1988 most forms of so called \\"true hermaphroditism\\" and \\"pseudohermaphroditism\\" excluded a person from serving in the military.John F. Patton; Urology - Page 148 Policies and treatment People born with non-standard genital anatomy or ambiguous genitalia are largely excluded from military service. This practice is believed to have been first introduced in 1961, alongside a ban on transvestites. According to a 2007 report from the Michael D. Palm Center, there is a long list of disqualifying genital differences that are used to bar individuals from service. For example, having one undescended testicle can make a man ineligible for service. Enclosure 4 of \\"Induction in the Military Services; dated April 10, 2010\\" instruction, entitled \\"Medical Standards For Appointment, Enlistment, Or Induction\\", is the one that identifies the preclusion of some intersex people from serving in the military. *Paragraph 14. (Female Genitalia), subparagraph e.: :::History of major abnormalities or defects of the genitalia such as change of sex (P64.5) (CPT 55970, 55980), hermaphroditism, pseudohermaphroditism, or pure gonadal digenesis (752.7). *Paragraph 15. (Male Genitalia), subparagraph l.: :::History of major abnormalities or defects of the genitalia such as change of sex (P64.5) (CPT 55970, 55980), hermaphroditism, pseudohermaphroditism, or pure gonadal dysgenesis (752.7).https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/613003p.pdf?ver=2018-05-04-113917-883 According to The Crimson, the military's policy on genital differences is explicitly discriminatory. Despite the steady increase of other previously excluded members into the military since the repeal of \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\", there has not been much change with respect to the status of intersex people. Military medical policies still prevent intersex people from serving uncloseted.Research Handbook of Expatriates; 309 However, the military does provide some surgeries for intersex people which they deem 'medically necessary' as opposed to 'cosmetic'.Life Course Perspectives on Military Service; 117 The Veterans Health Administration does distinguish between surgeries for transgender individuals and intersex persons. In 2015, this allowed intersex persons to receive medically necessary treatment that was still prohibited for transgender people. This was because of the belief that intersex surgery caused \\"fewer practical concerns\\". However, a history of genital surgery prior to service is considered an acceptable reason to discharge a service member. The acceptance of transgender individuals in 2016 by the Armed Forces did not touch on intersex people and they are still subject to specific reviews before enlistment, as noted before.Inclusion in the American Military: A Force for Diversity; 163 An intersex National Guardsman who had Gender Confirmation Surgery expressed that he was afraid and uncertain of what would become of him after the passing of the bill.https://www.optionsri.org/post/lgbtq-concerns-in-the-2020-election-by- jonathan-lucero-mckinney The updated version of DoDI 6130.03's genital guidelines are as follows: *Female Genitalia: :::History of major abnormalities or defects of the genitalia, such as hermaphroditism, pseudohermaphroditism, or pure gonadal dysgenesis. *Male Genitalia: :::History of major abnormalities or defects of the genitalia such as hermaphroditism, pseudohermaphroditism, or pure gonadal dysgenesis. The subsequent attempt at banning transgender troops by President Donald Trump in 2017 also did not touch on the state of intersex personnel, and it was unclear if the ban would have any intentional or unintentional effects on them. Intersex activist and Navy veteran Dana Zzyym has expressed that their family's military background made it out of the question for them to be associated with the queer community as a youth due to the prevalence of homophobia in the armed forces. Their parents hid Zzyym's status as intersex from them and Zzyym discovered their identity and the surgeries their parents had approved for them by themselves after their Navy service. Zzyym is the first veteran to be issued a gender- neutral passport. Opinions In 2010, Republican representative Duncan D. Hunter implied that intersex people were always banned from service. However, this claim was contradicted by a veteran who stated that they were allowed to serve openly and be deployed to Desert Storm as an intersex woman. Activist Autumn Sandeen also refuted Hunter's claims in a statement on her blog. In contrast, another response to Hunter was from Choire Sicha of The Awl who stated that \\"intersex people aren‚Äôt welcome to serve, but no one‚Äôs quite sure how and why\\", but did not elaborate on if they believed this referred to all conditions or just visible ones. Along with trans and non-heterosexual people, Hunter includes intersex people on his list of queer groups which he believes to be unfit for service because he holds the belief that they would disrupt unit cohesion. At the time when speaking about the subject he referred to intersex people by the term \\"hermaphrodites\\", which drew criticism from several intersex advocates and allies since it is a medically inaccurate term for a human being and is seen as a slur in the 20th century. His comments were also mocked on the NPR comedy news show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! which joked about his opinion on the subject, claiming that including intersex people would be advantageous to the military, since they could \\"pursue enemies into both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs restrooms\\". This joke was poorly received by some, including writers of ShadowProof, who stated that it was both insulting to intersex people and a play on the negative stereotype of trans people as potential bathroom sexual predators, and Queerty. Hunter's comments were also ridiculed by the cast of the FOX News show Red Eye who felt that his comments were merely about his dislike of homosexuals and not really about how intersex people would affect the military. They stated that since there are so few intersex people the question was not very relevant to the subject of \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" which they felt was what Hunter was trying to imply. The cast of The Tony Kornheiser Show dismissed Hunter's concerns as well, expressing too that the number of intersex people that exist who want to join the military could not be enough to disrupt any operations.Transgenders And Hermaphrodites In The Military?; The Tony Kornheiser Show In 2007, the Palm Center released a report concluding that most of the military's beliefs about intersex people were myths and that neither intersex nor transgender peoples' medical problems posed any barrier to effective service. The study also argues that the rigidity of sexual difference, gender roles, and sexuality are \\"becoming increasingly less absolute,\\" which could raise questions regarding the admission, retention, training, housing, and other services of intersex individuals in the armed forces. Veterans Intersex veterans are entitled to \\"medically necessary\\" surgeries. When transgender people were banned from receiving sex reassignment surgery, intersex people were also banned from these surgeries. This meant that someone who was in the military presenting as male in their records could not transition to a female identity with help from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, even if they were always predominantly female in all but writing. By service =United States Air Force= Many U.S. Air Force recruiters think that intersex people should be disqualified from service due to \\"the expected increased demand for medical treatments\\" but intersex persons are still allowed to serve in the Civil Air Patrol.2014; Operative Pediatric Surgery - Page 901 =United States Army= In the U.S. Army, the official policy is that individuals who identify as intersex or have other sex-related disorders are medically problematic and/or psychologically disturbed; hence, they are not eligible to serve. =United States Coast Guard= Intersex people are allowed to serve in the Coast Guard Auxiliary. However, they must choose to be represented as either \\"male\\" or \\"female\\" on their records. =United States Marine Corps= The USMC takes the same stance as the Army, disqualifying both intersex people and transgender people from service. =United States Navy= In 2008, many U.S. Navy recruiters believed that intersex people should be disqualified from service, mainly due to the expectation that they would cause increased demand for medical treatment. ROTC The Reserve Officers' Training Corps is obliged to follow the guidelines set by the military and has rejected intersex youth because of this. This, along with their exclusion of transgender people, has led to criticism from and of schools such as Harvard which did not allow the ROTC until \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" was repealed in 2010, but welcomed them afterwards. The critics argue that the return of the ROTC to campus violates the school's non-discrimination clause.

The channel was available nationally on cable and satellite on the Foxtel subscription platform, in metropolitan areas of Australia through free-to-air digital terrestrial television, and streamed online. The channel launched on 1 October 2018, replacing both Sky News Business Channel on Foxtel and Extra on DTT. Until its closure on 17 May 2019, the channel featured stock market and trading information during opening hours of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), much like its predecessor Sky News Business, and aspirational and lifestyle programming during primetime. History The channel was announced in June 2018; it would be operated as a joint venture between Australian News Channel (a subsidiary of News Corp Australia) and Nine Entertainment Co. (through Nine Network) via Australian Money Channel Pty Ltd., replacing the former's finance channel Sky News Business Channel on Foxtel and the latter's datacasting informercial channel Extra on DTT. Promotional trailers ran on the former channel spaces of both Sky News Business and Extra until 6am AEDT on 1 October 2018, when the channel was launched. The channel retained large portions of programming and staff from the Sky News Business Channel, but would feature lifestyle and consumer- focused programs outside of trading hours. Your Money was headquartered at the News Corp Australia headquarters in Sydney, which Sky News Business moved to at the start of 2018. Kylie Merrit was the channel's CEO. The channel closed on 17 May 2019, with the staff and viewers being given two weeks notice; the channel's owners declared Your Money was financially unsustainable due to lack of advertisers. On DTT, Nine began gradually placing an HD version of 9Gem on Your Money's channel space, area by area. On Foxtel, the channel space on channel number 601 that was created by Sky News Business in 2008 folded and ceased to exist. Programming Your Money consisted of many programs which aired on its predecessor Sky News Business Channel, consisting of live rolling coverage and analysis of the ASX and international markets, finance and economic news throughout the day on weekdays. The channel's primetime line-up featured flagship program Your Money Live, followed by bespoke specialty programs until 11pm AEST when the channel simulcast Fox Business Network.

He currently manages Central United FC and Kings College First XI in New Zealand's Northern League and Auckland City FC's youth team in New Zealand's National Youth League and has previously held various head coach and assistant coach roles with New Zealand Football including most recently as the assistant coach of the New Zealand national women's team. As a coach, he has won New Zealand's Chatham Cup (twice), the OFC Champions League, New Zealand's Northern League, and the OFC U-20 Women's Championship (twice). He has twice coached a New Zealand team to the knockout stages of a FIFA age-group World Cup, one of only two coaches do so with a team from that country. His Kings College First XI once beat Auckland Grammer 4-1. Coaching career After a career teaching at secondary school level in Dunedin and Wellington, McFarland began his club coaching career with Central United in Auckland, leading them to two Chatham Cup titles in his three year spell at the club, including a Northern League/Chatham Cup double in 2007. During this period he was also the youth team coach of Central's sister club, Auckland City FC, who he guided to a National Youth League title in 2007. In 2008, McFarland was appointed assistant coach to Steve Cain for the New Zealand U-17 Men's team. At the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Nigeria, that team became the first New Zealand team to progress beyond the group stage at any FIFA event. After working in a coach development role with New Zealand Football, McFarland returned to coaching in 2010 as co-coach of Auckland City FC in the New Zealand National League for the 2010-11 season, working alongside Ramon Tribulietx. The pair guided Auckland City to the 2011 OFC Champions League title, qualifying for the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup after a two-year absence from that event. A month out from the 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Mexico, in April of that year, New Zealand U-17 head coach Steve Cain resigned for personal reasons and McFarland was appointed as his replacement. The side repeated their effort of two years prior, making the round of 16, before being eliminated at the hands of Japan. McFarland had left his role with Auckland City for the 2011-12 season, with Tribulietx continuing as sole head coach but McFarland rejoined the staff as a Technical Advisor for the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup campaign in Japan. He took the role of head coach for the New Zealand U-20 Women's team in 2011, qualifying for FIFA U-20 Women's World Cups in 2012 and 2014. The 2012 campaign saw New Zealand defeat Switzerland and draw with Japan but a defeat to Mexico in their final group game saw the North Americans edge New Zealand for a place in the knockout stages. Two years later at the 2014 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada, New Zealand claimed victories over Paraguay and Costa Rica to qualify for the quarterfinals and become the first New Zealand age- group women's team to reach the knockout stages of a FIFA event. At that stage McFarland had been coach or assistant coach to all three New Zealand age-group sides to achieve that feat. In his 11 games at FIFA events as a head coach, McFarland has won four, drawn 2 and lost 5. McFarland's reappointment to the U-20 role in 2013 also coincided with his elevation to the role of assistant coach to the New Zealand women's national team. He left the role in November 2016 citing a desire to balance family commitments and return to a head coaching role. He returned to Central United as head coach for the 2017 winter season and also took the reins of Auckland City's youth team in the 2017-18 National Youth League. He joined the mighty Kings College First XI as head coach in 2019 to take the role after previous coach Daniel Rattray's retirement. The King's team played in the Auckland premier league in 2019. McFarland holds an Australian 'A' License as well as qualifications in Physical Education and Teaching.

Phosphenium ions, not to be confused with phosphonium or phosphirenium, are divalent cations of phosphorus of the form [PR2]+. Phosphenium ions have long been proposed as reaction intermediates.  Synthesis  =Legacy methods= The first cyclic phosphenium compounds were reported in 1972 by Suzanne Fleming and coworkers. Acyclic phosphenium compounds were synthesized by Robert Parry in 1976. thumb =Methods= Several methods exist for the preparation of two-coordinate phosphorus ions. A common method involves halide abstraction from halophosphines: :R2PCl + AlCl3 ‚Üí [R2P+]AlCl4‚àí] Protonolysis of tris(dimethylamino)phosphine affords the phosphenium salt: :P(NMe2)3 \\\\+ 2 HOTf ‚Üí [P(NMe2)2]OTf + [HNMe2]OTf Weakly coordinating anions are desirable. Triflic acid is often used. N-heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) have also been reported. Reaction of PI3 with the Œ±-diimine yields the NHP cation by reduction of the diimine and oxidation of iodine. thumb  Structure and bonding According to X-ray crystallography, [(i-Pr2N)2P]+ is nearly planar consistent with sp2-hybridized phosphorus center. The planarity of the nitrogen center is consistent with the resonance of the lone pair of the nitrogen atom as a pi bond to the empty phosphorus 3p orbital perpendicular to the N-P-N plane. An idealized sp2 phosphorus center would expect an N-P-N angle of 120¬∞. The tighter N-P-N angle observed in the crystal structure can be interpreted as the result of repulsion between the phosphorus lone pair with the bulky i-Pr2N ligands, as the P(NH2)2+ and PH2+ molecules have bond angles closer to 110¬∞ and 90¬∞, respectively. 348 px Calculations also show that the analogy to carbenes is lessened by strongly œÄ-donating substituents. With NH2 substituents, the phosphenium cation assumes allyl character. Generalized Valence Bond (GVB) calculations of the phosphenium ions as having a singlet ground state, singlet-triplet separation increases with increasing electronegativity of the ligands. The singlet-triplet separation for PH2+ and PF2+ were calculated to be 20.38 and 84.00 kcal/mol, respectively. Additionally, the triplet state of the phosphenium ion displays a greater bond angle at the phosphorus. For example, the calculated bond angle of the singlet state of PH2+ is approximately 94¬∞ compared to 121.5¬∞ in the triplet state. Calculated bond lengths between the two states are not significantly impacted.  Reactivity  Phosphenium is isoelectronic with singlet (Fisher) carbenes and are therefore expected to be Lewis acidic. Adducts are produced by combining [P(NMe2)2]+ and P(NMe2)3: :P(NMe2)2]+ \\\\+ P(NMe2)3 ‚Üí [(Me2N)3P-P(NMe2)2]+ Being electrophilic, they undergo C-H insertion reactions. = Reactions with dienes = Phosphenium intermediates are invoked as intermediates in the McCormack reaction, a method for the synthesis of organophosphorus heterocycles. An illustrative reaction involves phenyldichlorophosphine and isoprene: :320 px Isolated phosphenium salts undergo this reaction readily. There are few examples of reactions catalyzed by phosphenium. In 2018, Rei Kinjo and coworkers reported the hydroboration of pyridines by the NHP salt, 1,3,2-diazaphosphenium triflate. The NHP is proposed to act as a hydride transfer reagent in this reaction. thumb = Coordination chemistry = Structure of [(Et2N)2PFe(CO)4]+ as the AlCl4‚àí salt. Phosphenium ions serve as ligands in coordination chemistry. [(R2N)2PFe(CO)4]+ was prepared by two methods: the first being the abstraction of a fluoride ion from (R2N)2(F)PFe(CO)4 by PF5. The second method is the direct substitution reaction of Fe(CO)5 by the phosphenium ion [P(NR2)]+. Related complexes exist of the type Fe(CO)4L, where L= [(Me2N)2P]+, [(Et2N)2P]+, [(Me2N)(Cl)P]+, and [(en)P]+ (en = C2H4(NH2)2). thumbN-heterocyclic phosphenium-transition metal complexes are anticipated due to their isoelectronicity to N-heterocyclic carbenes. In 2004, Martin Nieger and coworkers synthesized two Cobalt-NHP complexes. Experimental and computation analysis of the complexes confirmed the expected L‚ÜíM œÉ donation and the M‚ÜíL œÄ backbonding, though the phosphenium was observed to have reduced œÉ donor ability. It was suggested that this is due to the greater s orbital-character of the phosphorus lone pair compared to the lone pair of the analogous carbene. Additional studies of NHP ligands by Christine Thomas and coworkers in 2012, likened the phosphenium to nitrosyl. Nitrosyl is well known for its redox non-innocence, coordinating in either a bent or linear geometry that possess different L-M bonding modes. It was observed that NHPs in complex with a transition metal may have either a planar or pyramidal geometry about the phosphorus, reminiscent of the linear versus bent geometries of nitrosyl. Highly electron-rich metal complexes were observed to have pyramidal phosphorus, while less electron-rich metals showed greater phosphenium character at the phosphorus. Pyramidal phosphorus indicates significant lone pair character at phosphorus, suggesting that the L‚ÜíM œÉ donation and the M‚ÜíL œÄ backbonding interactions have been replaced with M‚ÜíL œÉ donation, formally oxidizing the metal center by two electrons. thumb Additional reading =Cycloadditions=  * =Adducts=  =Electrophilic reactions=  =Coordination complexes=   *  References  Category:Cations Category:Phosphorus compounds ","title":"Phosphenium"},{"id":"58579619","text":"Justin Trevor Milne, , (born 19 November 1952) is an Australian business executive and company director known for his roles as Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, chief of broadband services at Telstra, and CEO at OzEmail, as well as serving on the boards of Tabcorp, the National Basketball League, NetComm Wireless, Members Equity Bank, MYOB Group. and NBN Co Milne was born in Adelaide, South Australia and was educated at St Peter's College before gaining a Bachelor of Arts from Flinders University.

Background and education Delury trained at Yale University, receiving a B.S. (1997), M.A. (2003) and a PH.D. in 2007, with all degrees in history. He is currently Associate Professor of Chinese Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. He had previously taught at Brown University, Columbia University and Peking University. He is the associate director of the Asia Society Center on U.S.-Chinese relations. He is the co-author, with Orville Schell, of Wealth and Power: China's Long March to the Twenty-first Century (Random House, 2013).He is a frequent contributor to multiple journals and newspapers, including Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, Global Asia, 38 North. and The New York Times. His career as a historian took a self-described detour when he visited South Korea for the first time in 2006 to meet his wife's family. His area of interest had been limited to modern Chinese history. After further visits to Korea, he joined the Yonsei faculty in 2010 and made Seoul his home base. His academic interests have since broadenend to include Korean peninsula studies, North and South; he has visited North Korea four times. He feels that his new interest in Korean affairs has broadened his views on China as well as U.S.-China relations. Views on China DeLury at a lecture Delury states that knowledge of China's history is critical; without looking backward to grasp the forces at work for hundreds of years, it is not possible to know China today or its possible future trends. He posits that through China's recent history there is one constant: \\"the search for something, anything,\\" that will restore China's greatness (fuqiang ÂØåÂº∑, signifying ‚Äúwealth and power‚Äù). China's challenge now is to reconcile its current success to its past sufferings, and relieve their historical sense of inferiority. Delury looks for historical parallels, such as the 1895 Gongche Shangshu movement, the 1919 May Fourth Movement, the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989, and the 2014 Umbrella Movement, threads which can be strung together, to chart alternate trajectories for the competing visions of China's future political and social order; he opines there are no right or wrong tides of history to take comfort in. While Mao had contempt for ancient Chinese customs, in the 1980's the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) began to use traditional themes and prominent classical vocabulary. A prominent example is \\"harmonious society\\" (Chinese: ÂíåË∞êÁ§æ‰ºö; pinyin: h√©xi√© sh√®hu√¨), used as a socioeconomic vision in China and to deflect the problems of social inequality. Delury traces the history and usage of the Chinese word \\"harmonious\\" and is critical of the CCP, calling this usage \\"the pseudo-Confucianism of the CCP.\\" He notes that Xi's political program of austerity is a reflection of a traditional political precept, dating from Confucius. Views on North Korea Traveling in North Korea evoked for Delury the sensation of time travel; Kim's charismatic dictatorship and the socialist ethos of Mao on the one side, with the grassroots marketization and consumer revolution of Deng's China on the other. As with the history of China, it is important to know the North Korean history, and he is critical of American officials who know little about this subject. Without this knowledge it is unlikely for American officials to understand and realistically deal with North Korea's nuclear weapons program, a highly complex problem with a lot of variation over time. > It takes years to understand that history and you can't read in a book even > if you had time, you have to meet the people. Delury has several significant disagreements with President Trump's North Korea policy. President Trump has relied on China's influence on North Korea to exert pressure on the regime to give up its nuclear weapons, using trade with China as an inducement. Delury notes that since 1958 China has not had any meaningful impact on North Korea's foreign policy. Delury has described the sanctions as futile and counterproductive. He has argued that they are unenforceable and unlikely to stop North Korea's nuclear weapons program. He has a more conciliatory approach, suggesting that the best chance for them to give up its nuclear weapons is by helping North Korean economic development. He recommends a gradual elimination of the sanctions. Talk of a preventive war had become part of the mainstream debate before the recent thaw in U.S.-North Korea relations; Delury feels that this should not be an option. Delury has been described as the media's \\"go-to expert\\" on North Korea; he warns that news about North Korea tends to be sensationalized, and care should be taken in judging its veracity. > There's a global appetite for any North Korea story and the more salacious > the better.

Bigler is Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. Bigler advocates for use of gender-neutral language and endorses use of ze as a personal pronoun to replace he/she and hir to replace his/her. (This convention is respected throughout this article.) Bigler is a recognized teacher of psychology and recipient of numerous teaching awards from the University of Texas at Austin, including the Raymond Dickson Centennial Endowed Teaching Fellowship award in 2011. Bigler is well known as an advocate against same-sex schooling. Ze argues that segregation based on sex or any other social characteristic is likely to increase prejudice based on that characteristic.  Biography  Bigler received a B.A. degree at Oberlin College in 1986. Ze attended graduate school at Pennsylvania State University where ze began conducting research on gender schemata and internalized sexualization under the supervision of Lynn Liben. Bigler obtained a master's degree in 1988 and a Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology in 1991. With Liben, Bigler conducted widely cited research on gender differentiation in development, social stereotyping and prejudice. Liben and Bigler also co-edited the 2014 volume The Role of Gender in Educational Contexts and Outcomes. Bigler joined the faculty of the Department of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin in 1991. Currently, Bigler is the Executive Director of the American Council for Coeducational Schooling.  Research  Bigler's research program has focuses on the development of stereotyped attitudes associated with gender and race/ethnicity. Ze is known for work highlighting the impact of gender stereotypes on children's development, especially for girls. Bigler aims to discover how and when children develop stereotyped views, and what external and internal observations impact children and their thinking. Bigler and her former student Sarah McKenney express concerns about girls' limited choices in Halloween costumes, and the tendency for girls' clothing and toys to promote the value of \\"being hot and sexy.\\" Their research has shown that adolescent girls who internalize beliefs about the importance of being sexually attractive to boys show increased rates of body surveillance and body shaming and perform worse in school and on standardized test scores than girls who score low on such beliefs. From a young age, girls may internalize gender stereotypes about how girls should act and behave, including how they should look and the types of clothes they should wear. Girls who internalize the beliefs that they must be attractive to men may spend more time on makeup and focus less on academics. Other research has examined the formation of intergroup attitudes among students in school settings. Bigler speaks strongly about how models provided to children contribute to social stereotyping and prejudice among children as they grow up. To Bigler, saying \\"Good morning boys and girls\\" is similar to saying \\"Good morning blacks and whites\\" as it draws attention to social categories that result in children viewing themselves and others differently. In a widely cited study, Bigler examined gender stereotyping in relation to classroom practices. In some classes, the teacher referred to students by gender (\\"boys\\" vs. \\"girls\\") while, in others classes, the teacher referred to mixed gender groups according to t-shirt colors (\\"red\\" or blue\\"). Teachers were explicitly instructed not to favor or show preference to one group of children over the other. After four weeks, children in classes where they were referred to as \\"boys and girls\\" showed increased gender stereotyping, whereas no change was observed in classes that used t-shirt colors to distinguish groups. Teachers may unknowingly impose gender stereotypes upon their pupils when they refer children as boys and girls. Such language appears to create tensions in the classroom that impact how children view and treat one another.  Representative Publications  * Bigler, R. S. (1995).

His paternal grandparents were Gustav Schwab, a German poet of note, and Sophie (Gmelin) Schwab. His mother was Catherine Elizabeth, daughter of Laurence Henry and Henrietta Margaretta (Meier) Von Post. Through her, he was descended from Heinrich Melchior M√ºhlenberg, the chief founder of the Lutheran Church in America. He was fitted for Yale University under private tutors and at Gibbons' and Beach's School in New York City. He received several prizes in English and Latin composition, High Oration appointments, and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa in college. As a Sophomore, he sang on his Class Glee Club, and the next year he was a member of the Second Glee Club. He was an editor of the Courant in his Senior year. He remained at Yale for a year of post-graduate study in political economy after taking the degree of BA, in 1886, and during this period was also an instructor in German at the Hopkins Grammar School. In July, 1887, he went to Europe, and after spending the summer in travel, entered the University of Berlin. His studies for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy were completed at the University of G√∂ttingen in 1889, and he then returned to the United States and spent some time in historical research in the libraries of New York City. He had received an M.A. in course at Yale in 1888. In the fall of 1890, he took up his work as lecturer in political economy at the University, being made an instructor in that department in the following year. He was promoted to an assistant professorship in 1893, and to a full professorship five years afterwards. In 1905, after seven years of service in that capacity, Professor Schwab was chosen University librarian, and the remainder of his life was devoted to the upbuilding of the Library. A member of the University Council since his appointment as librarian, he had served for some years on the Council's Committee on Publications, in connection with the work of the Yale University Press. In 1901, he supervised the arrangements for the Yale Bicentennial as chairman of the committee in charge of the celebration. He was a frequent contributor to historical journals and magazines, and at one time was editor of the Yale Review. The Finances of the Confederate States of America, published by Professor Schwab in 1901, is considered a valuable addition in the field of economic history. He was elected Secretary of the Yale Class of 1886 in 1905, and held that office until his death. To the work of civic betterment in New Haven, professor Schwab gave much of his attention, and at the time of his death he was serving as secretary and treasurer of the social settlement known as Lowell House. He was also president of the Model Housing Association of New Haven. He was on the board of trustees of the New Haven Public Library and a member of St. Paul's Protestant Episcopal Church, of whose Sunday school he was at one time superintendent, and for several years served in Company F, Second Regiment, Connecticut National Guard. He was a trustee of Mount Holyoke College, and in 1913 was on the committee which arranged the pageant held in celebration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of its founding. He was a member of the American and British Economic associations, the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Library Association, and of the Century Club of New York. In 1911, he received from M√ºhlenberg College the honorary degree of LL.D. Professor Schwab's death occurred unexpectedly at his home in New Haven, January 12, 1916, after a brief illness from pneumonia. He was buried in Grove Street Cemetery in that city. On October 5, 1893, he was married in New Haven to Edith Aurelia, daughter of Samuel Sparks Fisher, upon whom Yale conferred an honorary degree in 1851, and Aurelia Safford (Crossette) Fisher. She survives him with their two children: Katharine Fisher, a student at Vassar, and Norman Von Post. He leaves also two brothers and three sisters, one of the latter being the widow of Henry Charles White (B.A 1881, LL.B. 1883, M.L. 1884). Another brother, Laurence Henry, graduated from the College in 1878. Gustav Schwab (B.A. 1902) and Laurence Von Post Schwab (B.A. 1913) are nephews.

Most of southern Quebec is dominated by the Grenville Province, while the vast north is divided between the large Superior Province and the Churchill Province to the east, near Labrador. Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics The Grenville Province, which dominates southern Quebec, particularly the northern shore of the St. Lawrence formed beginning in the Archean, more than 2.5 billion years ago. Geologists subdivide the Grenville Province into the Allochthon along the river itself and the more northern Parautochthon. The Parautochthon is a band running parallel to the Grenville Front, which varies in width from Labrador to northeastern Georgian Bay on Lake Huron. Parautochthonous rocks are made up composed of ancient Archean and Proterozoic rocks that are highly deformed plutonic and metamorphosed supracrustal (metasedimentary and metavolcanic) rocks that reached greenschist to granulite facies on the sequence of metamorphic facies during the Grenville orogeny. These rocks correlate with the least deformed rocks north of the Grenville Front in the Superior Province and show signs of east-west lateral extension. The Allochthon includes all the lands of the Grenville Province south of the Parautochtone. The Allochthon juxtaposed on the Parautochthon during the Grenville orogeny cycle from 1.09 billion to 985 million years ago. The Allochthon is composed of Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic rocks. In the western part, it is mainly marble, quartzite, and pelite platform levels and Mesoproterozoic amphibolite- grade rocks. There are also charnockite and anorthosite intrusions that intersect metasediments and orthogneiss. In the center, migmatite, quartzo- feldspathic orthogneisses and mangerites predominate. In its eastern part, it consists mainly of gneissic rocks of varied composition and origin, metasedimentary rocks, granitoid intrusions, gabbro, gabbronorite and anorthosite. There are also several anorthositic intrusions scattered throughout the Allochthon belt. The Canadian Shield spans much of northern Quebec, which is primarily underlain by the Superior Craton, a 160-mile thick section of stable continental crust formed beginning 4.03 billion years ago. In the northwest and at the northern tip of the Ungava Peninsula is the large Churchill Craton, which extends into Labrador and Nunavut as the eastern extent of the Canadian Shield. Quebec's northern bedrock is also regionally composed of the Hudson Platform along the shore of James Bay and a small section of the Nain Province, near the northern tip of Labrador. The St. Lawrence Platform occupies the lowlands where much of Quebec's urban population lives, while the Gaspe Peninsula, Anticosti Island and the Magdalene Islands are part of the Appalachian Province. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= During the Taconic orogeny that began the formation of the Appalachian Mountains, amphibolite, mica schist and other metamorphic rocks formed a belt running down the Gaspe Peninsula to Sherbrooke. Muscovite bearing granites and metamorphic rocks around Asbestos formed over a broad span from 468 to 379 million years ago. While slate and plutonic tonalite formed in the vicinity of Becancour and Quebec City respectively. Around 292 million years ago, volcanism deposited tuff in the Magdalene Islands. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= Sedimentary deposition and some volcanic activity took place during the Mesozoic, particularly in the lowlands of the St. Lawrence Platform. Central Montreal is underlain by 119 to 117 million year old plutonic basanite, lamprophyre and camptonite while to the immediate southeast amphibole gabbro and peralkaline rocks formed from 141 to 123 million years ago. Cretaceous intrusive rocks formed hills housed in the sedimentary rocks of the St. Lawrence Lowlands Platform, notably Mount St. Bruno. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= Quebec experienced intense erosion during the past 2.5 million years of the Quaternary, which often mobilized older rocks, such as Proterozoic granite boulders found offshore in the moraines which formed parts of the Magdalene Islands. Some of the youngest rocks in Quebec are situated along the western border with Ontario, including the Bedford Hill Rhyolite and dacites which are less than one million years old.

History of the Gonjas  According to Britannica: \\"Originally a Mande invader, Jakpa established a loosely knit federation of states that extended over the entire northern part of present-day Ghana and parts of Togo and Benin.\\" In the about second half of the sixteenth century, Gonja was founded by Mande Warriors and Mali traders with Naba or Nabaga as their leader. The area between the Black and White Volta were known for trade so it attracted them. The Mande Chief sent the Nabaga on an errand to discover if there was a fall in the gold supply to Mali. The Gonjas had their name from a 'corrupt' Hausa phrase Kasa Goro-Jaa which meant the Land of Red Cola. Ngbanye was the indigenous name of the Gonjas which means Brave Men. The Hausas of Sokoto and the Gonjas used to trade in cola-nuts. The Gonjas had their cola- nut supplies from the Ashantis which transported to the Salaga market. The Hausas demand in cola-nuts was high so they used to travel to the lands of the Gonjas to buy them.  Founding the Gonja Kingdom  Sumaila was said to be a trader himself who was from Malle or Mande. He became bankrupt and consulted a soothsayer about his fortunes in life. The man told him he would not ascend the throne even though he was from the royal family. He told Sumaila, his fortune was in foreign lands and that was where he would attain Kingdom for himself, his children and the people who follow him. He mobilized many fighting men and went out with them after he was convinced of what the soothsayer told him. It was said he used to invade many areas and left behind sons and servants who were loyal to him as either a Chief or as their leader. His first point of entry into the Gonja Kingdom was in a town in Bole State called, Ntereso-Bonfu. He defeated a certain fetish priest after he was informed there was a powerful shrine at Mankuma. He went there and displayed black power and made a show of strength. He made his sister and nephew the leaders there.  Death  Sumaila intended fighting the Ashantis but his army were tired because of the constant going to battle from all sides of the Gonja Kingdom. He did not heed to their warnings against fighting the Ashantis. He crossed the White Volta and a battle occurred between him and the Ashantis towards Yeji to Kabako. He was badly wounded and before he died, he commanded that his body be sent to his sister's burial place in Makuma. When they got to Abrumase which means (I am weak), he got very sick. He died at Trekpa which means (my end). His followers continued to Gbipe and Gbi means (Weight or Heavy Load) to accompish Sumaila's wish. His corpse was getting spoilt so the body was interred in Gbuipe. His tomb can still be found in Old Buipe in the Central Gonja District of the Gonja Kingdom.  Legacies  He appreciated the strength of diversity and inclusion. He did not discriminate or marginalized against any of his subjects no matter the tribe. He had encounters with Muslim Scholars who were not Gonjas and made some of them his trusted advisors and leaders. He did not show prejudice or teated with contempt people from Hausalands and Baribari at Kafaba. He enskinned people of other tribes as Chiefs in places he defeated.

Biography De Beer was born in Paramaribo in 1749 or 1750, on her parents' plantation Berenrust. Her father was Joost de Beer (d. 1756), and her mother en Anna Cornelia van Echten (1716-1782). Her father died when she was around six, and her mother remarried, with Pieter van Akeren (d. 1779), who owned the Dordrecht plantation. On 10 June 1763 Sara left for the Netherlands, with her slave Dido, followed by her mother and sister in May 1766. What they did in the Netherlands is unknown, but all four returned to Surinam in October 1767. Early in 1773 Sara registered her intention to marry Nicolaas Vlier, a man twenty years her senior, and they got married on Dordrecht a few weeks later. Their family quickly grew to include six children. In 1774, the couple started De Weeklyksche Woensdaagsche Surinaamse Courant, the first and only newspaper of the colony until 1785. In 1776, they bought the first printing house in Suriname. When her husband died in 1781, she continued the business, and used her name on the newspapers. During the 1780s the business got into financial problem, and de Beer had to sell off some slaves \\"who could read and write.\\" De Beer published at least six newspapers, but often received warnings from the government, and at least one publication ban.

Composition Many prisoners are two to a cell, and most cells have the dimensions by . Phoenix has 3,422 beds. It has inmates convicted of capital murder, many from the Philadelphia area and most of whom were sentenced to life imprisonment but with some under death sentences, housed in a dedicated section of the prison, called the \\"Capital Unit.\\" That section is larger than the previous capital case section that was in Graterford. Susan McNaughton, the PADOC press secretary, stated that the prison hoped to move inmates with death sentences from SCI Greene, where most death row and capital murder inmates in Pennsylvania reside, to SCI Phoenix so that the prison system can more easily transport them to court proceedings.

History  The 15 cm sFH 93 was designed and built by Krupp and entered service in 1893. The sFH 93 was designed with the lessons of the Franco-Prussian and Russo-Turkish war in mind where field guns with smaller shells and limited elevation had difficulty overcoming fortifications. What was needed was a howitzer capable of high- angle fire which could fire a large shell to drop inside the walls of enemy fortifications. The sFH 93 was fairly conventional for its time and most nations had similar guns. However, its lack of recoil mechanism made it dated and by the time the First World War broke out it had been largely replaced. The majority of military planners before the First World War were wedded to the concept of fighting an offensive war of rapid maneuver which in a time before mechanization meant a focus on cavalry and light horse artillery firing shrapnel shells. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. The theorists hadn't foreseen that trenches, barbed wire, and machine guns had robbed them of the mobility they had been counting on and like in the Franco- Prussian and Russo-Turkish war the need for high-angle heavy artillery reasserted itself. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. The combatants scrambled to find anything that could fire a heavy shell and that meant emptying the fortresses and scouring the depots for guns held in reserve. It also meant converting coastal artillery and naval guns to siege guns by either giving them simple field carriages or mounting the larger pieces on rail carriages. Although largely replaced by the German Army before the First World War the sFH 93 was brought back into service because of a combination of higher than expected losses of field artillery and insufficient numbers of heavy guns which led to them being brought out of reserve and issued as replacements to field artillery regiments. Design The sFH 93 was a short barreled breech-loading cannon on a rigid two-wheeled box trail carriage. The barrel was a typical built-up gun of the period with all steel construction. The gun had an early form of horizontal sliding-block breech and it fired separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. The sFH 93 fired a wide variety of different projectiles which are listed here. The advantage the sFH 93 had over its predecessors was that it was made from nickel-steel of much greater strength than previous guns of cast iron construction. This meant that the sFH 93 could be much smaller in diameter and lighter in weight than its predecessors which meant it was easier for it to keep pace with infantry divisions on the march. It also meant that unlike previous guns it could be transported in one piece and was light enough to be part of maneuvering forces to overcome local strong points rather than relegated to the slower siege train. However, the cavalry still felt the sFH 93 was too heavy for their use so they were assigned to heavy howitzer battalions of the infantry. For travel, the gun could be attached to a limber and towed by a six-horse team and each battery consisted of four guns with four batteries per battalion. Like many of its contemporaries, its carriage did not have a recoil mechanism. For prolonged use a spot of ground could be leveled and a wooden firing platform could be laid for the guns. The guns could then be connected to an external recoil mechanism which connected to a steel eye on the firing platform and a hook on the carriage between the wheels. A set of wooden ramps were then placed behind the wheels and when the gun fired the wheels rolled up the ramp and was returned to position by the combined effect of the recoil mechanism and gravity. In the field only ramps were used. There was also no traversing mechanism and the gun had to be levered into position to aim. A drawback of this system was the gun had to be re-aimed each time which lowered the rate of fire.

It was formed from the split of the Northern Territory in 1927 alongside the territory of North Australia; the dividing line between the two was 20 degrees south latitude. The two territories were merged in 1931 to reform the Northern Territory. Central Australia's seat was in Stuart, which was known commonly, and has been officially since 1933, as Alice Springs. Background The split occurred because interior minister George Pearce felt that the Northern Territory was too big to govern efficiently, and was part of Pearce's plan to create a specialised commission to develop Australia north of the 20th parallel. It occurred on 1 March 1927. Government Whereas the Northern Territory had been governed by an Administrator, both North Australia and Central Australia were governed by \\"Government Residents\\". The Government Resident of Central Australia was paid ¬£750 annually while the Resident of North Australia received ¬£900. The seat of government was located at Stuart, which was commonly known as \\"Alice Springs\\" at the time and would be officially renamed so in 1933. The Government Resident of Central Australia was required to have a medical background. He was instructed in his duties by the Minister of Home and Territories and assisted by an Advisory Council comprising two appointed and two elected members. Ordinances of the Northern Territory continued to have effect in Central Australia. John C. Cawood served as Resident of Central Australia from 1927 to 1929, while Victor Carrington served from 1929 to 1931. North Australia and Central Australia both continued to be part of the Division of Northern Territory in the federal House of Representatives, whose member could participate in debates and join committees but could not vote and did not count in forming a government. For the entirety of the two territories' existence the representative for the division was Laborite Harold George Nelson. There was no developed judiciary in the territory, all judges being locally-appointed justices of the peace. A courthouse was built in Stuart and it was intended that a federal judge would visit it periodically to hear major cases. No such visits had occurred by 1930, however, and Central Australia's Supreme Court remained in Darwin in North Australia. This led to allegations of abuses within the judiciary, as witnesses were unwilling to travel that far. Crimes that fell out of the remit of the justices of the peace were reduced in the courts so that they could be heard by them; in one case a charge of murder was reduced to assault. Some action was taken by the federal government to correct these abuses. Economy Wood grown in the area fetched a high price in markets in South Australia. The development in the area was said by a recent tourist of the area to be scarcely different from when \\"James [sic] Stuart\\" had first trekked across the area in 1862, although it was expected that the automobile and railway would help spur development. Abolition The Northern Territory Pastoral Lessees' Association submitted recommendations to Home Affairs Minister Arthur Blakeley on 28 March 1930 on how to develop the land of the Northern Territory. The Association stated that the development of the Northern Territory had cost Australians up to ¬£10 million to develop with little to show, and among other things were adamant that the distinction between the territories be abolished. Blakeley reacted favorably to the proposals and submitted them to Cabinet the next week. The Government tabled the Northern Territory (Administration) Bill 1930, which would merge the two territories back into one and abolish the North Australia Commission that had been established to supervise North Australia. Blakeley asserted that such a move would potentially save Australians ¬£8,000-¬£9,000 per annum, but representative Nelson claimed that the abolition of the Commission and the reversion to Canberra administration over the Northern Territory would negatively impact progress in the area. The territory was disestablished effective 11 June 1931.

Blue was the first African-American to head a public library and his efforts led to the Louisville Free Public Library being nationally recognized as a leader in segregated library administration and education for African Americans. Early years Thomas Fountain Blue was the second child of Noah Hedgeman Blue and Henry Ann Crawley, both former slaves. Blue attended Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute from 1885 to 1888, after which he taught school in Virginia. In 1894 he enrolled at Richmond Theological Seminary, graduating in April 1898 with a Bachelor of Divinity. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Blue served in the Sixth Virginia Volunteers and was stationed in Camp Poland in Tennessee and Camp Haskell in Georgia. After the war he moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where he was in charge of the Colored Branch of the Louisville Young Men's Christian Association and served on a number of civic associations, including as a charter member of the Louisville Chapter of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. Library career Blue became the first African-American to head a public library in 1905. The Western Colored Branch was the first Carnegie colored library in Louisville, Kentucky. it was the first public library in the nation to serve African-American patrons with an exclusively African- American staff. In 1914 he was also made Librarian in charge of the newly opened Eastern Colored Branch of LFPL. Blue became known for the high value he placed on training library personnel: These classes were the first library training program for African Americans in the United States. Blue was dedicated to cultivating the library as a space for the use of the community; social clubs frequently made use of the Western and Eastern Colored Branches. From 1919 to his death in 1935 Blue was the director of all library work for African Americans in Louisville, including work bringing library collections to seventeen schools in the Jefferson County area. At the American Library Association conference in 1922, Blue presented information about his training class; he was the first African American to be on an ALA program. Blue was the founder of the Negro Library Conference, which was first held at Blue's alma mater Hampton Institute in March 1927. The Negro library training program that Blue established at LFPL continued as the Hampton Library School. The Louisville apprenticeship program ended in the early 1930s when professional library schools began to fill the gap of educating librarians. Blue died November 10, 1935; a resolution passed later that month by the Louisville Free Public Library Board of Trustees referred to him as \\"a trusted, loyal and highly competent administrator\\" and \\"a pioneer in this field of public service among Colored People\\". In 2003, the American Library Association passed a resolution recognizing \\"the leadership role of Reverend Thomas Fountain Blue in laying the foundation for the continued presence of African American libraries, library students, and library employees in all types of libraries within the United States and abroad\\". Personal life Blue married Cornelia Phillips Johnson in 1925; they had two sons together. Through his marriage he was the brother-in-law of Lyman T. Johnson, an educator and advocate for racial desegregation in Kentucky. Blue continued to be a preacher and church leader throughout his life.

He has his own solo project, Shades of Scar, under which name he released The Hollow Season in 2010.  Music career  Born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina, Bost relocated to Los Angeles upon graduating from Appalachian State University with a degree in Music Industry Studies in 1997 to pursue a career in music. After working in recording studios for two years, he joined Elijah Blue Allman's band, Deadsy on Ztar and guitars and toured with the band as Carlton Megalodon over the next several years. Deadsy had been initially set to release their first full- length album, Commencement, on what was Sire Records, which became Elektra Records. Due to the poor timing of the label change up, the band began looking for a new label in 1999. Bost joined the band, after which they were signed to Jonathan Davis‚Äô Elementree Records, and Deadsy was asked to join the first Family Values Tour in 2001. Commencement was released in May 2002. By 2004, Deadsy had begun work on their follow-up album. That same year, Bost met Terri Nunn and joined Berlin on guitars. He collaborated and co-produced with Nunn much of her new material. Deadsy's Phantasmagore was released in 2006 on Immortal Records. The band was asked back to the Family Values Tour that summer, sharing the stage with Korn and Deftones. After Family Values came to an end, Deadsy went on tour with Deftones again that fall. In February 2007, Deadsy went on hiatus while the band's members worked on other creative projects.

Several rebel groups, including ISIL, White Flags and the Iraqi Baath Party fight the Iraqi military (largely backed by the United States and other countries conducting airstrikes against ISIL) and allied paramilitary forces (largely backed by Iran).  Context  The insurgency is a direct continuation of the War in Iraq from 2014 to 2017, with mostly Sunni rebel groups continuing armed opposition against the Shia-led Iraqi Government. Along with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), other insurgents fighting the government include a group known as the White Flags which is reportedly composed of former ISIL members and Kurdish rebels and is believed by the government of Iraq to be part of Ansar al-Islam and possibly affiliated with al-Qaeda. The group operates mostly in the Kirkuk Governorate and has used an assortment of guerilla tactics against government forces. Other factions opposed to the Iraqi government include the Iraqi Baath Party currently led by Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri a former official to Saddam Hussein during his rule in Iraq and has been active in Iraq's conflict since the US-led invasion in 2003 leading multiple factions including the Naqshbandi Army and Supreme Command for Jihad and Liberation. In September 2017, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIL, called on ISIL supporters around the world to launch attacks on Western news media and continued in his message the ISIL must focus on combating the two- pronged attack on the Muslim Ummah; these statements marked a departure from previous rhetoric which was focused on the state building of ISIL and heralded a shift in ISIL's strategy toward a classical insurgency.  Course of the insurgency  Since ISIL's loss of Mosul in late 2017 which was declared as Iraq's victory over ISIL and widely seen as an end to the war, and declared as such by Iraq's Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, multiple incidents of violence have occurred being carried out by the conflicting sides, in spite of Iraq's declaration of victory over ISIL the group is widely seen as far from gone and continues to retain a presence throughout Iraq, and still capable of carrying out attacks and skirmishes with pro-government forces. ISIL has been waging a guerrilla war with a strong presence in the governorates of Kirkuk, Diyala, Saladin, and Sulaymaniyah, with local forces largely ill-equipped and inexperienced, ISIL has also taken advantage of the areas rough terrain to carry out operations. ISIL has also made a notable presence in the cities of Kirkuk, Hawija and Tuz Khurmato and has carried out attacks at night in rural areas. ISIL fighters also reportedly move through villages during the day without interference from security forces, and locals have been asked by ISIL to give fighters food and give information on the whereabouts of Iraqi personnel, locals have also stated that ISIL fighters will frequently enter into Mosques and ask for Zakat to fund the insurgency. Among ISIL's operations include assassinations, kidnappings, raids and ambushes. According to the Pentagon, as of fall 2018 ISIL was still stronger than it was between 2006‚Äì2007, when the group declared the Islamic State of Iraq during its incarnation as al-Qaeda in Iraq, citing a UN report which claimed that ISIL still had 20,000‚Äì30,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq. That claim of strength was simultaneously tempered though, with the Pentagon saying that ISIL had lost all of its territory and fighters were scattered, making them much less of a threat. The Pentagon predicted that ISIL will lose strength because of their dispersion in a way similar to what happened to al-Qaeda, while also warning that ISIL is still in a position to make a comeback. Following ISIL's defeat they have been greatly weakened and violence in Iraq has been sharply reduced in 2018. Only 95 people lost their lives during the month of May, the lowest figure in 10 years.  Timeline  = 2018 =  January‚ÄìApril  Between January and February 2018, Iraqi security forces and Peshmerga clashed with the White Flags around parts of the Kirkuk and Saladin governorates for control of oil fields which the Iraqi government claims the group's priority is. The Iraqi government said in the clashes the composition of the White Flag's fighters are ISIL members and individuals linked to the Kurdish mafia, the government also alleges that the Kurdistan Region allowed oil theft to occur in the area while it was under their control and enabled ISIL for their own interests. In March 2018, in two separate attacks ISIL reportedly killed 10 individuals including a pro-government Sunni tribal Sheikh along with his son and guests at his house in the town of Al-Shirqat south of Mosul, in the other attack ISIL killed 5 individuals from the same family whom were Iraqi Turkmen and Shia at a fake checkpoint set up by the group posing as Iraqi security forces. * 22 March 2018 - Six individuals and 15 others were at a checkpoint set up by ISIL the group killed six individuals and injured 15 others from the Iraqi Turkmen minority on their way to Erbil from Baghdad between Tuz Khurmato and Daquq to celebrate Nowruz.

History of movie theaters in South Korea  In 1902, in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of King Gojong's death under the leadership of the royal family, the Hyopyol-sa theater was opened in Jeong-dong. However, the Hyopyol-sa theater was not meant to be permanent. The Danseongsa theater in Jongno 3-ga was the first permanent theater in Korea, and is the oldest cinema in South Korea. The Danseongsa theater was built in 1907 as a two-story wooden structure and was used for performances such as dances in Buddhist attire and gayageum. It was taken over by Park Seung-pil in mid-1910, and a kino drama with a mix of plays and movies began to be performed. In 1998, the CGV Gangbyeon branch with 11 theaters opened in South Korea, opening the era of multiplex theaters and creating a large-scale movie industry.  Variety of theaters in South Korea  = Single theater = Before the creation of multiplex theaters in the 1980s, most theaters were single-theaters. In 1903, the first theater in South Korea, Dongdaemun Activity Photography, was built in the parking lot of Dongdaemun Market. With the growing popularity of Dongdaemun Activity Photography, the first government-run theater of South Korea, Hyopyul-sa, also began showing films in July 1903. At the theater, visitors could watch a package-style program that featured short films for 5 to 10 minutes and stage performances such as kisaeng dance and pansori. The first permanent movie theater was Danseongsa, which was built in 1907. At the time of its establishment, it was a place for traditional performances, but it became a permanent movie theater from 1910. In October 1919, it screened the first South Korean-made film, \\"Fight For Justice\\".  Single-theaters present in 2019  = Cinema M = It is operated by Daegu MBC, showing only one movie at a fixed time. It is currently built on the first floor of the 16-story MBC building in Daegu and opened on December 1, 2000. = Donggwang Theater = It was built in 1959, and it can accommodate a total of 283 people. = Gwangju Theater = The Gwangju Theater is the only theater in South Korea with only one screen. The Aegwan Theater in Incheon, considered the first indoor theater in Korean society, has been transformed into a multiplex, and the civilian theater Danseongsa, which opened for the first time in the Korean Empire capital, was closed. Against this backdrop, Gwangju Theater, which established a corporation in 1933, opened in 1935, and is ahead of its 82nd anniversary as of 2017. It has 862 seats and shows art films, independent films, and movies from around the world that are not shown in general theaters. On the last Wednesday of every month, the cinema shows a film station program including art exhibitions and music concerts as well as watching movies. = Drive-in theaters = In the 1990s and 2000s, drive-in theaters nationwide became more popular. The first drive-in theater of South Korea opened on April 23, 1994 at Bearstown in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province. At that time, a large screen measuring 12 meters wide and 5 meters long was installed. In the 1990s, it was said that it was not easy for ordinary people to buy private cars, and that watching movies was considered a sort of luxury date at the time. = Multiplex theaters = In December 1986, the opening of the three-screen Damoah Theater and Cinehouse 2 Hall in 1987 opened the era of the multiplex theater. Several multiplex theaters have even placed restaurants and shopping centers in their buildings, which is the origin of multiplex cinemas today. The multiplex began with the CGV Gangbyeon branch. Currently, the three-way system of CGV, Lotte Cinema and Megabox forms most of South Korea's theater businesses. = IMAX = In South Korea, the first IMAX theater opened in the 63 Building in 1985 and opened later at the 1993 World Expo in Daejeon. As of 2017 there are currently a total of 16 IMAX theaters in South Korea, with the CGV Yongsan branch, the CGV Cheonho branch and the CGV Wangsimni branch having the biggest screens. The IMAX laser tube, which is 31 meters wide and 22.4 meters long, has been installed in South Korea, with the largest-ever multiplex screen and high-resolution laser projection. = 4D theaters = 4D cinemas have been created in South Korea at a time when prospects are raised that the era of movie theaters is over with the proliferation of digital devices. CJ 4DPLEX, a CJ CGV subsidiary that introduced the world's first 4D movie theater, has set up and operated 29 theaters nationwide and 196 theaters in 34 countries in January 2016 since it opened its first 4DX theater at CGV Sangam in 2009. = Small cinemas = In the absence of cinemas in relatively less populated areas, the small theater business was pushed forward. The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and local governments worked hard to establish small cinemas to enhance the local residents' enjoyment of the film culture and quality of life. = Dolby Atmos theaters = With the Surround Sound technology developed by Dolby Atmos Institute, each sound in a movie can be controlled individually by adding speakers to the front and ceiling of a general hall sound system. This technology was first introduced for movie theaters in 2012, and MX Hall (in COEX) of Megabox is a representative theater in South Korea. It has installed 69 Meyer speakers for use in Carnegie Hall and Opera House. = ScreenX = ScreenX is a screen system that utilizes not only the front screen of a movie theater but also the left and right walls as a screen, so surrounded by three screens. It is currently installed on 64 screens in 50 theaters nationwide. It is the world's first multi-face screening system that was co-developed by CGV and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2013. = Holographic technology = In South Korea, a huge hologram performance was held in 2014, involving Psy, Big Bang and 2NE1, which was possible because \\"Klive,\\" a hologram concert hall funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Information and Communication and KT, was created. Their performance at the 1,653-square-meter hologram concert hall was a combination of colorful dance performances and a 270-degree view media facade, giving audiences even greater enjoyment. = Art theaters = It is a type of theater that screens art, diversity and independent films. However, the number is gradually decreasing because of large theaters such as multiplexes. Therefore, it mainly screens independent films, art films and third world films. Various multiplex brands also operate art film theaters. In 2014, CGV also launched CGV Art House, a brand dedicated to independent and artistic films.Lotte Cinema operates Arte Classic. = Silver Cinema (1969) = Silver Cinema is a movie theater in Seoul designed to create a space for the elderly.  Cinema for Silver 'Hollywood'  It is located in Jongno, which has been described as the center of politics, culture and commerce since the Joseon Dynasty.It maintains a ticket price of 2,000 won for senior citizens over age 55. The cinema shows movies that the elderly might have seen when they were young. During the weekend, popular singers such as Jeon Yeong- rok, Jeon Won-ju and Hyun-mi perform, helping the elderly to dance and enjoy themselves.  Myounghwa Cinema  Myounghwa Cinema is the only silver theater in Gyeonggi Province, which was built by the local government.  Theater culture in South Korea  = Culture Day = Culture Day is a day that provides various benefits on the last Wednesday (including the corresponding week) of every month so that people can easily access the culture in their daily lives. On cultural days, more than 2,000 cultural facilities across the country, including movie theaters, performance halls, museums, art galleries and cultural assets, can be enjoyed at a discount or for free. = Theater snacks = Snack bar in Lotte cinema Based on data from 2014, the prices of popcorn and soda at the three major multiplexes are the same. The original popcorn M size and L size are 4,500 won and 5,000 won, respectively, while soda M and L size are 2,000 won and 2,500 won, respectively. The price of the combo set (popcorn L-size + two drinks M-size) was 8,500 won at the three major multiplexes.  Beer  Among the three movie theaters, Lotte Cinema is the only one that doesn't sell beer. Megabox sells Asahi draft beer for 8,000 won per glass. The combo menu, which offers two cups of Asahi draft beer and one of the nachos, squid and hot dogs, is priced at 18,000 won. CGV sells Hite draft beer for 3,500 won per glass, and the combo menu, which allows users to choose between nacho, grilled squid with butter and popcorn, including two Hite draft beer and almonds, is priced at 9,500 won.  Various snacks  Snacks in Lotte Cinema Megabox sells a variety of items, including \\"S-Potato\\" with fried and seasoned potatoes, \\"Chicken & Chips\\" made with fried chicken and \\"Curry Wurster\\" with curry powder on top of baked sausages. Some CGVs sell a variety of popcorn in addition to regular popcorn. Among them, the Gourmet Popcorn is a menu made by Le Cordon Bleu's chef and has four types: Creamy Caramel, Real Cheese, Caramel & Cheese Mix and White Berry.

Thucydides mentions that it was crossed by the Spartan army during the Peloponnesian War as a place that crossed the Spartan army, under the command of Eurylochus, between Phytia and Limnaea, on its march to Battle of Olpae in 426 BCE. It was one of the few towns in the interior of the country which maintained its independence against the Aetolians after the death of Alexander the Great. At length, in 231 BCE, the Aetolians laid siege to Medeon with a large force, and had reduced it to great distress, when they were attacked by a body of Illyrian mercenaries, who had been sent by sea by Demetrius, king of Macedonia, in order to relieve the place. The Aetolians were defeated, and obliged to retreat with the loss of their camp, arms, and baggage. Medeon is again mentioned in 191 BCE, as one of the Acarnanian towns, of which Antiochus, king of Syria, obtained possession in that year. The site of Medeon is near the modern village of Katouna.

Biography  Horrocks was born in the Auckland suburb of Mount Albert on 4 June 1941, the son of Jack Horrocks and Edith Barbara Horrocks (n√©e Rhodes). Majoring in English, he completed a BA (1962), MA First Class Honours (1963), and PhD (1976) from the University of Auckland. His doctoral thesis, supervised by C. K. Stead, was titled Mosaic: a study of juxtaposition in literature, as an approach to Pound's Cantos and similar modern poems. He also studied for two years with Allen Tate at the University of Minnesota (1964‚Äì65) and one year with Thom Gunn at the University of California, Berkeley (1966). In 1973, receiving a Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies, he studied with Robert Creeley at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In 1964 he married Eleanor Seguin. Their daughter, Simone Horrocks, is a film director, and Dylan Horrocks is a cartoonist and writer. His second marriage, in 1979, was to Shirley Heim (n√©e Spitz), herself a documentary filmmaker, and he became stepfather to Steve and Tony Heim. He taught at the University of Auckland from 1967 to 2004, and on his retirement became an emeritus professor. Honours and awards In the 2005 New Year Honours, Horrocks was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the film and television industries. Other awards include a Distinguished Teaching Award from the University of Auckland in 1998, a ‚Äú10K Award‚Äù from the Broadcasting Commission (NZ On Air) in 2002 for services to broadcasting, and an Industry Mentor Award at the first New Zealand Scriptwriters Awards in 2010. Also, in 2014 he received a New Zealand History Research Trust Fund Award, and in 2015 a Michael King Centre Residency. In 2019 the Royal Society of New Zealand awarded him its Pou Aronui Prize for his lifetime contribution to the Humanities. The Royal Society described him as ‚Äúa champion of New Zealand culture, particularly New Zealand‚Äôs film and television industries, as well as literature and the visual arts.‚Äù  Educational work  Horrocks was one of the New Zealand pioneers of the academic study of film and television. He taught Film Studies in adult education courses from 1967, then a University of Auckland course at graduate level from 1975. His teaching was timely because a New Zealand film industry was just emerging. Horrocks became Head of the Centre for Film, Television and Media Studies established in 1994, and was appointed Head when it became a full Department in 2000. He wrote and edited textbooks (beginning with On Film in 1980) and many academic papers and books (such as Television in New Zealand, which he co-edited with Laurence Simmons in 2004). A number of his students went on to become film-makers, or academics in the field of media studies. (The film-makers include: David Blyth, Vanessa Alexander, Sam Pillsbury, Alison Maclean, Gregor Nicholas, Hester Joyce, Roseanne Liang, Lisa Reihana, Dan Salmon, and Ray Waru. Academics include Brian McDonnell, Trisha Dunleavey, Simon Sigley, Geraldene Peters, Xuelin Zhou, Margaret Henley, and Lynne Star.) He also played a significant part in the establishment of film teaching and media studies in secondary schools. During the 1980s, Horrocks was a co-editor of the influential literary magazines AND (1984‚Äì85) and Splash (1984‚Äì86), and a Contributing Editor to Parallax (1982-3). Mark Williams in The Oxford History of New Zealand Literature in English has characterised Horrocks as one of ‚ÄòNew Zealand‚Äôs most alert and inventive critics.' Douglas McNeill in the Journal of New Zealand Literature describes him as ‚Äòa close reader‚Äôs close reader.‚Äô Terry Sturm singled out his essay ‚ÄòThe Invention of New Zealand‚Äô as a ‚Äòseminal‚Äô reading of the work of Allen Curnow. A selection of Horrocks's criticism was published as Re-Inventing New Zealand, 2016, and he has also written collections of poetry, including Song of the Ghost in the Machine which was a finalist in the 2016 Ockham New Zealand Book Awards.  Len Lye  Horrocks played a central role in the re-discovery of expatriate film-maker, kinetic sculptor and writer Len Lye. He worked as Lye's assistant during the artist's last year (1980), then after his death he helped to ensure that his papers and works were returned to New Zealand. Horrocks wrote a biography of the artist which was a finalist in the 2002 New Zealand Book Awards and has been described by the British journal Sight and Sound as the ‚Äúdefinitive piece of Lye scholarship‚Äù. His subsequent book, Art That Moves (2009), explores the aesthetics of Lye's ‚Äúnew art of motion.‚Äù He has also edited three volumes of Lye's writings and co-edited another. In 2012 he wrote the libretto for Len Lye: the Opera, with music by Eve de Castro-Robinson, which was performed at the Maidment Art Centre, with expatriate singer James Harrison returning to New Zealand to play the role of the artist. Horrocks has been a long-term trustee of the Len Lye Foundation and was involved in the creation of the Len Lye Centre which opened in New Plymouth in 2015.  Public policy work  When the Broadcasting Commission (NZ On Air) was created in 1989, Horrocks was appointed as one of the original board members. He served for eleven years, and for the last four years was Deputy Chair. Horrocks has been one of the founders of many cultural organizations, including the Auckland International Film Festival (established 1969), Alternative Cinema (1972), Association of Film & Television Teachers (later the National Association of Media Educators, 1983), Artspace (1986), NZ Electronic Poetry Centre (2001), NZ On Screen (2006), and Script to Screen (2009). He was a board member for many years of the Auckland University Press (and Board Chairman, 2001-2004), and on the advisory board of Te Ara (from 2002). His other public policy work has included positions in the Arts Council (1975‚Äì77 and 1985-7), Creative NZ (1998), and the Short Film Fund of the NZ Film Commission (1985-6).  Film-making  Horrocks was a co-scriptwriter of the feature film Skin Deep (1978). In 1975 he became a co-director of the film company Point of View Productions. Since then he has been the researcher or co-researcher of documentaries directed by his wife Shirley. In 2009 he wrote and directed the film Art that Moves which won the Van Gogh Prize in the 2010 Amsterdam Film Festival.

Bowsette ( ) or Koopa-hime (), is a fan-made, moe anthropomorphized and gender-swapped version of the Mario franchise character Bowser, in which he is transformed to resemble the character Princess Peach using a power-up. The character was created on 19 September 2018, by a Malaysian artist named Ayyk92 as part of a comic strip which he posted online. Bowsette quickly rose in popularity internationally, with related hashtags in English and Japanese trending on Twitter. Bowsette is typically portrayed as a Caucasian blonde woman with horns, fangs, a spiked collar with matching armbands and a black strapless dress. Several professional Japanese artists contributed their own renditions of the character. A convention themed around Bowsette was planned for October of the same year. Journalists took notice of the trend and were surprised by its longevity, attributing it to various aspects such as the character's appearance and appeal or the possible desire by fans to shock Nintendo's social media handlers. While some noted much of the art that spawned from it was solely pornographic, others were quick to emphasize that some had a wholesome tone instead. Bowsette's rapid popularity led to other fan-made characters in a similar vein in a short timespan, each based on an existing Nintendo character. In Japan, concerns were raised about the legality of fan- made characters under Japan's copyright law.  Background  thumb Created by Nintendo in 1985, Super Mario is a long running series of platform games. The series primarily revolves around the protagonist, Mario and other playable characters, such as his brother Luigi, rescuing the kidnapped princess Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser. As the player progresses, they can gather in-game power-up items that let the player character gain new abilities or forms. During a prerecorded Nintendo Direct presentation broadcast in September 2018, Nintendo showcased a trailer for their 'Deluxe' re-release of New Super Mario Bros. U for the Nintendo Switch, which featured their character Toadette as a new playable option, and a new power-up exclusively for her, the Super Crown. When picked up, it would transform Toadette into \\"Peachette\\", a form that resembled Princess Peach but with Toadette's hairstyle and other distinctive features. The unveiling of Peachette led to speculation and theories by fans over how the Super Crown item operates within the game's universe. Shortly after, artist Ayyk92 posted a four-panel fan comic on DeviantArt and Twitter with the caption \\"The Super Crown's some spicy new Mario lore\\". In the comic, Mario and Bowser are shown disheartened after their simultaneous marriage proposals to Peach are rejected, referencing the ending of Super Mario Odyssey. However, while Mario consoles him, Bowser reveals that he is holding the Super Crown power-up, and in the last panel, the two are shown walking past Peach and Luigi, with Bowser now transformed into a female character resembling Peach but with a black strapless dress, fangs, large horns protruding from the sides of the head, and Bowser's spiked attire and shell. Unnamed in the original comic, the character was dubbed \\"Bowsette\\" by English-speaking fans. A related hashtag quickly trended on Twitter, amassing over 150,000 mentions and fan art shortly after, with some renders giving the character darker skin and/or red hair as a callback to the original Bowser. Pornhub and YouPorn each reported a dramatic increase in searches for the character on their websites by 500,000 and 2900%, respectively, and by the end of 2018 was the 9th most searched term on the site with 34.6 million searches. The character also trended among Japanese Twitter users under the name Koopa-hime ( \\"Princess Koopa\\"), with several major Japanese artists contributing their own art of the character. These artists included Street Fighter and Darkstalkers character designer Akira Yasuda, One-Punch Man manga artist Yusuke Murata, Pop Team Epic series creator Bkub Okawa and Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid series creator Coolkyoushinja. An event dedicated to the character titled \\"Project Crown\\" was also planned for 27 October, featuring fan art and crossdressing cosplay. In 2018, pornographic production company Wood Rocket produced a porn parody titled \\"Wetter Than A Water Level: The Bowsette Porn Parody\\" based on the meme with April O'Neil as Bowsette and Tommy Pistol as Mario.  Reception  In their \\"Nintendo Voice Chat\\" segment, several IGN writers spoke at length about the phenomenon, with Brian Altano describing it as \\"people have latched onto something and made ... a randy or impure version of something that is historically known as pure\\", and attributing part of the appeal in how it would confuse Nintendo's social media handlers. Casey DeFreitas disagreed, attributing some of the character's popularity to the \\"monster girl\\" trend in Japan while also noting several of the fan comics for the character were actually wholesome, but criticizing the name as not following the naming convention established by Peachette's name. Kotaku Gita Jackson noted the overabundance of art for the character, stating that she was \\"overwhelmed by how strongly Bowsette has taken root in video game fandom\\". In a video with Tim Rogers, she added that she had never seen a trend \\"hit Twitter this hard\\", and noted the heavy Japanese support both for the character and original artist. Alex Olney of Nintendo Life noted his surprise at the trend's longevity, reasoning that the juxtaposition of something \\"edgy and sexy\\" to the Mario setting but also fitting within the narrative Nintendo has created might be the reason as why that is the case. Don Nero of Esquire described the character as \\"dominatrix-inspired\\", proposing that the character could be seen as a positive symbol of female empowerment along the likes of Samus Aran or Lara Croft, though complained that a bulk of the art was \\"overtly male-gazey, dripping with horrendously over-the-top, seam-bursting cliches that call to mind the bodacious sex-dolls of Dead or Alive Volleyball\\". Ars Technica Sam Machkovech attributed some of the character's popularity to how it contrasted against Peach, stating the fan art's focus on a \\"more muscular, less svelte figure [...] lets Peach look a little less Barbie-proportioned\\". Nick Valdez of ComicBook described the character as combining \\"the cutesy elements of Peach's design with the harder edges and spiky tail of Bowser, making the amalgam of the two characters a delightful artist prompt for fans\\", though cautioned about the explicit nature of some of the fan art. Ana Valens of The Daily Dot noted the character's broad appeal, but also as a relatable figure for trans women, stating, \\"Bowsette is exactly how we see ourselves: We went from self-hating, gender dysphoric creatures and turned into happy and confident women\\". Bowsette's popularity led to fans exploring concepts of other characters changed by the power-up into figures resembling Peach, including Super Mario character King Boo transformed into \\"Boosette\\" or \\"Booette\\", which also saw a great deal of fan art. Zachary Ryan of IGN noted that with all the different artists, it had moved beyond merely being the concept of \\"what if Bowser was a girl?\\". He added that \\"so many artists that you wouldn't know get to flex a little muscle\\", being able to show works they had created in a similar vein. Other artists such as Fairy Tail creator Hiro Mashima also weighed in with reverse- gender versions of their characters as well. He voiced caution for participants in the trend \\"to be careful not to cause trouble for copyright holders and companies that they are contracted to\\", and noted that even if he wanted to draw fan art, he would need the approval of publishers and other related parties. Other Japanese news outlets more directly discussed the legality of such characters under copyright law, specifically Bowsette, and whether they infringed on Nintendo's own copyright. Despite fan petitions to make the character canon, Nintendo did not comment on it, stating \\"Concerning the drawings and other things uploaded to the Internet, we have no comment\\". Additionally the game's release included an in-game note that the crown would only affect Toadette. However, gaming publications noticed a similarity between the character and an unused concept for Super Mario Odyssey shown in the artbook, where Bowser took over Peach's body similarly to Mario's capture ability in Odyssey, and she inherited several of his features from the possession, questioning whether Nintendo would now explore the concept further. Alex Olney stated that it would be unlikely that Nintendo would add the character to a game at some point. Although he did expect to see Nintendo interact with the trend in some fashion, adding \\"I think it would be a fun little thing and Nintendo are being a lot more fun recently\\". Newsweek and Know Your Meme named it one of the \\"Top 10 Video Game Memes of 2018\\", stating that \\"Fandomization of Bowsette was not only inevitable, but obligatory\\", and adding that while previous renditions of a female Bowser existed online, Bowsette's design was \\"something new\\". The Daily Dot cited it as an example of how \\"people embraced being horny on Twitter\\" in 2018, stating that \\"very nature of the meme‚Äîa powerful, masculine villain becoming a buff, domineering woman‚Äîfascinated users with transformation and feminization fetishes\\", and that the character's non-normative appearance added to the appeal, namely with queer women. Metro named it one of the \\"12 Biggest Video Game Stories of 2018\\", calling it \\"an easy winner for the most unlikely video game story of the year\\" and noting its popularity both with Nintendo fans and online porn search results, further adding \\"It's probably best not to ask\\". The meme also placed 16th on Japan's Twitter Trend Awards, earning a special \\"Steering Committee Special Award\\" due to its rapid growth. Ayyk92 later received a physical trophy from Pixiv and Niconico for the award.

The series has been licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media, with the first volume being published in June 2019. Plot On her first day attending the elite Itan Private High School, the main setting of the story, Shouko Komi immediately receives an overwhelming surge in popularity due to the unprecedented, stoic beauty and refined elegance her classmates perceive her to possess. However, only Hitohito Tadano, an exceedingly average schoolboy assigned to the seat next to hers, is able to have the opportunity to discover that, behind her bish≈çjo appearance, Komi has serious issues in communicating with others. Tadano sets out to help Komi on her quest to find 100 friends. Characters ; :An absolute beauty to anyone, Shouko Komi in reality suffers from extreme social anxiety and communication problems, making her largely unable to talk to others. However, her attractiveness and stoic appearance (which in itself results from her anxiety) is perceived as refined class, making her highly popular while preventing people from actually getting to know her. Komi's first conversation with Tadano is over a blackboard, and she uses a notebook to convey her feelings through writing. Despite this, she is still capable of verbal conversation over a cell phone. Her dream is to overcome her communication problems and make 100 friends. ; :Sitting next to Komi, Hitohito Tadano is, as he name implies, an \\"average\\" schoolboy in every possible way. Discovering Komi's communication problems by inadvertently becoming the last students remaining in the classroom, he befriends Komi and, over a blackboard, promises to help Komi to accomplish her dream of having 100 friends, with him being the first. As the story progresses, Tadano gradually uncovers Komi's issues and gets to know more of her personality, while ultimately being in denial of his slowly- progressing romantic feelings for her. His name is a wordgame of ; :Rumiko Manbagi is a gyaru who joins Tadano and Komi's class in their second year of high school. She initially presented herself with an excessive amount of make- up, scaring people off and causing her to become increasingly lonely - even suffering ill physical health because of it. Tadano and Komi befriend her and help her overcome her loneliness;from then on, Rumiko considers herself their best friend. She eventually drops the make-up entirely, as well. Similarly to Komi, Rumiko is described as a 'wallflower' by her friends. Her affection towards Tadano also grows to the point where, torn between it and her friendship with Komi, she offers to step aside for Komi's sake;Komi refuses to allow such a course of action, reasoning that she cannot allow her friend to sacrifice her happiness for her own sake. ; :A character with an ambiguous gender, Najimi Osana has been friends with Tadano since middle school. Long knowing them as a boy, it is to the latter's surprise that the former now dresses in a girls' uniform, albeit with a boy's tie, as they both advanced to the Itan High School. Najimi's gender is never confirmed, and they are frequently referred to with gendered pronouns, although it is implied that Najimi is genderless. Najimi regularly switches from saying they're a boy or a girl and laughing that anyone ever thought otherwise, though Tadano connects this more with what he describes as pathological dishonesty. They are the \\"ultimate\\" childhood friend, as everyone in the school has known them since childhood, due to their family's frequent moving during their childhood. Najimi is depicted as having immense capability in conversing and befriending others as a result of their childhood moving, but was hampered when introduced to Komi by Tadano, as their unsuccessful childhood attempt to befriend Komi left them with psychological trauma.

In the time of Pausanias more than half the population was employed in fishing for the murex, which yielded the purple dye.
