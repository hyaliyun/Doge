The general election in February 2014 was boycotted by the opposition Democrat Party amid street protests against the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. A week before the senate election the Constitutional Court annulled the general election.Thailand in limbo after election annulled; economy suffering, Reuters, 21 March 2014 The Prime Minister and most of the ruling MPs are facing investigation by the National Anti Corruption Commission, who can refer politicians to the senate for impeachment. The Senate can pass an impeachment with a 60% majority, which results in a ban from political office for five years. Electoral system Since 2007, the Senate of Thailand has been made up of 150 senators, of which just under half are appointed by a Senators Selection Committee, made up of establishment figures. According to political scientist Duncan McCargo, \\"most appointed senators are broadly in the pro- Democrat camp\\" which is opposed to the acting government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. A local think tank, the Siam Intelligence Unit, estimates that 90% of the appointed senators are anti-government.Poor Turnout for Thai Senate polls, Today (Singapore newspaper), 30 March 2014 Elected senators must be independent from political parties, with no immediate relatives in parliament and must not have been a member of a political party in the last 5 years.

In the capital Bangkok, the seat was won by Auditor-General Jaruwan Maintaka, who is best known for her membership of the \\"Asset Scrutiny Committee\\" set up by the military government following the 2006 Thailand coup. The election of Jaruwan who is a known critic of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was seen as an attempt of the Bangkok electorate to reduce the influence of the pro-Thaksin camp on Thai politics.Bangkok voters attempt to ‚Äòward off Thaksin‚Äô, Bangkok Post, 31 March 2014 Despite the requirement to be non-partisan, several new Senators are informally linked to different political camps.

It has been performed in several venues. It premiered at the 2010 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The Off-Broadway production, which ran from September 11 ‚Äì October 23, 2011 at the New York Theatre Workshop (NYTW), earned awards for its sound design. The show directed by John Collins and produced by Ariana Smart Truman and Lindsay Hockaday received the Lucille Lortel Award for being outstanding. Details It was performed at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh in 2010, the Arts Bank in Philadelphia in 2010, at ArtsEmerson in Boston in 2011, the NYTW in New York City in 2011, the 2012 Dublin Theatre Festival, and McCarter Theatre in Princeton in 2012. The work, named for a bar at which the protagonists gather, features a bullfight on stage. The show is faithful to the original ill-fated romantic triangle between Americans Robert Cohn and Jake Barnes and Brit Lady Brett Ashley that was set in Spain and France. This work is like much of the Elevator Repair Service's other performances in which \\"the cast recites parts of the book verbatim while also drolly enacting dance, drama and mayhem onstage\\". The show was notable for its unusual cacophony, which is controlled by the performers rather than sound technicians. The Off-Broadway production began previews on August 19, 2011 and officially opened on September 11. It was scheduled to run until October 9 and was extended until October 23. A production at Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C., opened on February 18, 2017 and will run until April 2.

David Zinn was nominated for the Lortel Award in Outstanding Scenic Design. Critical commentary Lyn Gardner of The Guardian, while noting its length, praised the performance in Edinburgh describing it as \\"theatrical open-heart surgery on Ernest Hemingway's first major success\\" done with \\"surgical expertise and a droll, playful humour\\" that is too long at nearly four hours. Erik Piepenburg of The New York Times says that although words are important to this performance, so are sounds. When Ben Brantley of The New York Times saw the 2010 Philadelphia performance, he praised the presentation of the alcoholic consumption and continuous party atmosphere saying \\"This alcoholic element is what has been conjured so persuasively\\" and the show is \\"a wood-paneled temple to drinks past, present and future\\". However, upon seeing the 2011 Off-Broadway performance, Brantley says \\"...it never entirely wraps its mind around the style and essence of the book that inspired it\\". The Village Voice's Helen Shaw describes the show as \\"a gleefully drunken, offhandedly contemporary animation of Hemingway's hardboiled classic\\". Adam Hetrick of Playbill described the performance as \\"a dramatic explosion of Hemingway's 1926 novel, that melds text, theatrical avant garde and an evocative soundscape\\".

Retrieved 30 March 2014 Her hands are folded and rest on the lower border of the brown marbled frame, in an early and effective example of trompe-l'≈ìil. The woman's identity is lost. There have been a number of attempts to associate her with a historical person, including in the 19th century, as Willem Moreel's daughter Mary. Willem Moreel was a magistrate of Bruges who commissioned from Memling a portrait diptych and, later, a triptychBlum, 98 for the Church of Saint James at Bruges which he had founded. But any identities have in turn been rejected; in the case of Mary Moreel, she would have been too young in 1480 to be the woman portrayed.Ridderbos et al, 432 The sitter wears a truncated hennin under a sheer veil which falls across her face and over her shoulders. She has very pale skin, and a fashionably high forehead, with her hair tightly pinned to fit under the head-dress. Her dress is dark purple or black ‚Äì the colours have darkened from their original blue ‚Äì with a white collar above a red breastplate or bodice. The lower border of the frame contains a carved banderole with an inscription reading SIBYLLA SAMBETHA QUAE / EST PERSICA; associating the woman with the Persian Sibyl. A painted metal cartouche placed at the top left of the picture is a later addition, and contains the words \\"SIBYLLA SAMBETHA QVAE ET PERSICA, AN: ANTE CHRIST: NAT: 2040\\" (The Sibyl Sambetha, the Persian, in the year 2040 BC).Eemans, 24 The scroll at the end of the frame bears another later addition, the text of which refers to Mary with the words ECCE BESTIA CONCVLCABERIS, GIGNETVR D(OMI)NUS IN ORBEM TERRARVM ET CREATUM VIRGINIS ERIT SALVS GENTIVM, INVISIBILE VERBV PALPABITVR (Here let the serpent be trampled under your talon, let the Lord be born in the earthly realm, and the Virgin's creation will become the world's salvation: the invisible word will be made palpable).

Works  Rosen's artwork is largely text-based, employing \\"formalism, linguistics, and humor to reveal content that is hidden within both the structural nature of written language and the ways in which meaning can be generated through the manipulation of text.\\" The artist is interested in expressing language visually, and she focuses primarily on wordplay.Rosen, Kay. \\"Publish to Flourish.\\" Art in America. October 2014, Vol. 102 Issue 9, p. 128-129. Many of her works are representations of words in which certain letters have been juxtaposed or rendered in different colors or scales in order to reveal hidden messages or to draw attention to the relationship between language and meaning.Sholis, Brian. \\"Kay Rosen.\\" Artforum International. September 2005, Vol. 44 Issue 1, p. 307. These features of Rosen's style can be seen in Untitled Grid at the Indianapolis Museum of Art and in The Whitney Museum of American Art's Spare Parts. In some works, language becomes structure, \\"with words and letterforms functioning as building blocks, and where, through unusual typographic arrangements, words and phrases can embody the thing they are describing\\". Her precisionist-style works span in size from mural- to laptop-sized. Rosen's work frequently veers into commentary on the U.S. political condition, often deploying wit and humor.  Exhibitions  In addition to works created for gallery spaces, Rosen is known for publicly presenting work in the form of outdoor murals. The piece \\"Blurred\\" was exhibited along Interstate 70 as a part of the I-70 Sign Show. It was first located near Hatton, Missouri then moved to Warrenton, Missouri. The blurring of colors in text were interpreted as a statement related to political divides between Missouri's rural and urban populations. Blurred (2004) is currently in the collection at the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

Jane  In 1932, he set out to create a comic strip that would be as popular to adults as the famous 'Pip, Squeak and Wilfred' was to children. And so, Jane was created. For the first few years, Pett's wife Mary modeled for him but eventually he started to use professional models instead, the most famous of which was Chrystabel Leighton-Porter who modeled for him during World War Two. Until the war, Jane had a little daily funny story, but at the start of the war, she became a continuous story. \\"The turning point in Jane's career, when she became a success was when we turned her from a daily joke into a continuous story.

Eventually reaching the rank of brigadier, he was part of the king's council (honoured with the Order of Avis and Order of Tower and Sword), before holding the position as 7th Captain-General of the Captaincy-General of the Azores.  Biography  Francisco was part of the House of S√° e Lage, of Ponte de Lima, and was the brother of Ant√≥nio de Ara√∫jo e Azevedo (1754-1817), first Count of Barca, an influential politician of the time. =Captaincy-General= Francisco Ant√≥nio was nominated as 7th Captain-general of the Captaincy of the Azores on 20 August 1816, disembarking in Terceira on 11 May 1817: he took-up his office on 14 May 1817. He began his mandate by promoting the development agriculture through the Junta de Melhoramentos Agr√≠colas of modern agricultural practices, such as rotating crops and fallow lands.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.82 Many of the local farmers did not appreciate these practices, assuming that there were ulterior motives, and destroyed hedgerows and fences. The governor had troops intervene and impose his orders. He ordered the culling of goats that were in empty lots (or which had devastated cultivated crops), in order to control herds and transform agriculture from a subsistence to commercial enterprise. These measures were badly interpreted by the general population, who developed a hate for him, referring to Captain- General as the mata-cabras (goat-killer). Fearing that the diplomatic crisis between Portugal and Spain, resulting from the Portuguese conquest of the Banda Oriental (province of Cisplatina) by Portuguese troops in 1817, would result in possible reprisals against the Azores, he promoted not only a thorough reform of the military structures in the archipelago, but also the restoration and construction of new forts (such as the Fort of S√£o Jos√©, the Fort of S√£o Caetano and the Fort of S√£o Jo√£o).Manuel Augusto Faria (2000), p.156 He also obliged soldiers and workers to complete military roads, constructing bridges and munition depots, imposing daily military exercises. These intense efforts had a demoralizing effect on the populace, and in S√£o Jorge, recruits cut their index fingers in order to avoid service. It was during his tenure that the sumptuous Church of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista, whose riches had expanded during the stay of King Afonso VI, was destroyed by fire.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.83 The following year he visited S√£o Miguel (who had been without a Captain-General since 1767), and because of the unpopularity of the Captains-General he was obliged to stay in the municipal hall during his stay. Owing to this rancore, many of his orders from Terceira were never obeyed, and he was forced to advance with construction plans for the islands defenses. At the same time, he promoted the expansion of the first roadway from Ribeira Quente to Furnas. Between 1820 and 1821 he resided in the Pal√°cio Bettencourt, which was constructed in the late 17th and early 18th century, eventually becoming the seat of government. =Later life= Having led the Constitutional Revolt in Angra that deposed his successor, Francisco de Borja Gar√ß√£o Stockler, he was killed in a counter-revolution that occurred on 3‚Äì4 April 1821. He was buried in the church of the Fortress of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista on Monte Brasil, but his remains were later transferred to the cemetery of Livramento in Angra do Hero√≠smo.

Collaborators in the project Scott Snibbe, Damian Taylor, and Andy Cavatorta appear in the documentary to talk about their role in the development of the album and the live show. It also includes neurologist Oliver Sacks, who talks about the effect of music on the brain. Despite the low ratings, the show received positive to moderate reviews from critics, who applauded the content of the documentary but, in some cases, criticised the interaction between Attenborough and Bj√∂rk, which was considered \\"awkward\\" and \\"unlikely\\". The documentary was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 5 May 2014.  Cast  In order of appearance: * Bj√∂rk * Graduale Nobili * David Attenborough * Henry Dagg * Matt Robertson * Oliver Sacks * Andy Cavatorta * Damian Taylor * Scott Snibbe * Tilda Swinton ‚Äì Narrator  Background and release When the Biophilia project was first unveiled, it was announced that a documentary including footage of studio recording, interviews and rehearsal for the live performances, which would culminate in the first live performance at the Manchester International Festival, was in the works. While the original idea for the documentary never materialised, the project evolved as a mutual collaboration between David Attenborough and Bj√∂rk herself. On 1 August 2012, it was reported that UK Channel 4 had inked a deal to air a documentary, tentatively titled Attenborough and Bj√∂rk: The Nature of Music, that would have included a discussion between the two about the story of music, human's relationship with it and how technology could evolve the way we engage with it. The documentary was inspired by the Biophilia project and would have featured footage commented by Attenborough, along with a showcase of the instruments created for the Biophilia Tour. British-American neurologist Oliver Sacks was also reported to appear in the documentary, explaining \\"the extraordinary and beneficial effects music has on our brains\\". The documentary, made by the company Pulse Films, is the first time the British television channel and the company had collaborated. It was directed by Louise Hooper and executive produced by Lucas Ochoa, who commented about the project: > \\"Born from Bjork‚Äôs revolutionary music project we are thrilled to be able to > document this incredible journey with her; she is undeniably one of the most > iconic figures in popular culture and truly pushes boundaries like no other > artist does.\\" The English naturalist had previously provided the spoken introduction for the live shows and the apps. The two had long admired each other's works. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bj√∂rk had confessed that, when she was a kid, she considered Attenborough her \\"rock star\\". Attenborough stated that the singer \\"is really quite enchanting\\" and called her \\"honey\\" during the filming, reportedly because he could not pronounce her name properly. Bj√∂rk stated about the experience of the filming with Attenborough: \\"He would close off and take in whatever I was saying, and then just come out with the most beautifully formed sentences you ever heard\\". Director Hooper, whose father John had filmed Attenborough in different documentaries settled in Papua New Guinea, Mali and the Amazon rainforest, had stated: > \\"There is an unexpected chemistry and fun between these two unique > characters. They are both icons of their own separate worlds of music and > nature, and both excited and curious to explore how these two worlds come > together. Seeing Bjork and Sir David laughing and engaging with each other > on screen is simply magical, it was fascinating to have the chance to bring > Sir David and Bjork together for the first time on television. They were > both great fun to work with; Bjork fizzing with ideas for the film and Sir > David bringing his passion and knowledge\\". The documentary was scheduled to air during November 2012 and to see a later limited cinema release in an extended cut. As of November 2012, the documentary was still in the editing. In June 2013, it was reported that the documentary would have its worldwide premiere at the Cortona Mix Festival in Italy. The festival then cancelled the projection. The documentary first aired on Channel 4 on 27 July 2013 as part of a series of documentaries called Mad4Music, now titled When Bj√∂rk Met Attenborough. When a crowdfunding was created on Kickstarter to fund the release of Biophilia on Android, one of the reward available for the backers who would have pledged ¬£120 or more was one early viewing DVD copy of the documentary. After Bj√∂rk had found a cheaper way to transport the apps on Android, the funding was cancelled. On 21 March 2014, it was announced that the documentary would be released on 5 May 2014 on DVD and Blu-ray. Before the release of the DVD, the documentary was shown for three nights at the MK2 Grand Palais in Paris, and it was also shown during the We Love Green festival.  Synopsis  The documentary opens with an introduction by Tilda Swinton, who gives a backstory about Bj√∂rk's career and her intention with the Biophilia project, stating that the singer conceived the project wanting to redefine music in the 21st Century. Images from the \\"Moon and \\"Mutual Core\\" music videos accompany her speech. After that, some frames focus on the Graduale Nobili who are singing the backing vocals to \\"Thunderbolt\\" on a cliff in front of the ocean in Iceland. Thereafter the scene shifts to an early rehearsal of the Biophilia songs in Iceland during November 2010. The choir begin to learn their parts in \\"Thunderbolt\\" and \\"Moon\\" under the guide of the singer. After that, the documentary shows the encounter between Bj√∂rk and Sir David Attenborough in the Natural History Museum in London. There, the naturalist and the singer discuss about the nature of music. They first talk about the importance of music and singing in the nature, with Attenborough explaining how music works for birds like the bird-of-paradise and the lyrebird, whose chirping is defined by the naturalist the \\"most complex sound ever\\", and he goes on by stating that the bird has developed an \\"impressive vocal range\\" which he compares to that of Bj√∂rk. Attenborough states that the human larynx is capable of many more sounds that preceded language. Therefore, the singer asks him how he thinks music works for the modern people, and the naturalist explains how he thinks popular music is \\"extremely sexual\\", comparing popular music to medieval troubadors, and that is why is so relatable to young people and animals, i.e. the gibbons, which mate by singing together out of excitement. Attenborough affirms that \\"the mystery is how music has been used by humanity for something that is transcendental\\". Footage from another rehearsal with the choir singing \\"Dark Matter\\" are shown before shifting to the encounter between Bj√∂rk and Henry Dagg in a metal workshop. Dagg had created the Sharpsichord, a solar powered cross between a harp and a barrel organ, which Bj√∂rk wanted to incorporate in one song. They are shown rehearsing \\"Sacrifice\\" and discussing the composition of the song. Attenborough states that our emotion comes from nature and that a composer has to be in contact with it. He then manages to compare the sound of Benjamin Britten's Sea interludes (which is playing in the background) to the sound of waves. The natural structure of music inspires Bj√∂rk who wants to bring nature in her composition. To discuss \\"Crystalline\\", Bj√∂rk and Attenborough go to the crystal room of the museum. They talk about the mathematical basis of Bj√∂rk's songs, who explains the time signatures of the verses and the chorus of \\"Crystalline\\" and compares the composition of a crystal to that of a song. Scenes from the choir recording parts of \\"Crystalline\\" guided by Biophilia musical director Matt Robertson are shown. Attenborough thinks that the beauty of mathematics can be heard in composition like the \\"Fugue 5\\" by Johann Sebastian Bach. Swinton tells how universe is made of patterns which are present in music but that we can't visualise, and how Bj√∂rk wants to change that. Because of that, the singer collaborates with Evan Grant, who works with cymatics. Grant explains how the Chladni plate works, and that he appreciates how Bj√∂rk tries to bring a real meaning in her music by taking a \\"scientific and realistic approach\\" to it. Grant tries to use cymatics on water for \\"Crystalline\\", which results can be seen in the music video for the song (directed by Michel Gondry). Swinton explains how Bj√∂rk's aim is to bring nature on stage for the Biophilia performance. Footage from the final rehearsal at Campfield Market Hall in Manchester for Biophilia world premiere at the Manchester International Festival is shown, with the Sharpsichord arriving at the venue. Some of other instruments used during the show are presented, like MIDI-controlled Tesla coil, invented by Nikola Tesla, and a gravity-harnessed pendulum harp invented by Andy Cavatorta of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Cavatorta recounts how Bj√∂rk declared to him that she wanted nature to appear like \\"some sort of a rock star on stage\\", and tells that the first prototypes of the instruments were filmed and shown to Bj√∂rk before she approved the final result. In one of the prototypes video the inventor puts a figurine of Bj√∂rk (as pictured in the Volta album cover) between the swings. The instrument, created solely for the \\"Solstice\\" performance, was commissioned because, as Bj√∂rk declares, the singer \\"got obsessed\\" with basslines (she hums a bassline of a composition by John Tavener as she says so). One of the major inspiration of the project itself, neurologist Oliver Sacks, who Bj√∂rk define as the \\"David Attenborough of the brain\\", lists the benefist music has on human and explains how when a human listens to music every part of the brain gets involved. This is very useful to people who suffers from dementia, who need evocative music which can help them in building a bridge to their past. Scenes from a nursing home, in which various patients with dementia are shown to benefit from different music played to them, accompany Sacks' speech. He affirms that the music expresses something that language can't. Scenes from the first performance of Biophilia are shown. David Attenborough's intro, which accompany the show, is partially heard, while Bj√∂rk affirms that music is a catalyst between the outer world and the inner world. A performance of \\"Thunderbolt\\" is partially shown, during which the singer is seen wearing a dress by Michael van der Ham, along with a big red wig, while the Tesla coil plays on stage. Swinton states that Biophilia \\"nature, music and technology come together\\" and that the Icelandic singer wants to develop a new kind of music-making which is \\"intuitive and accessible for everyone\\". This is driven by her desire to change we think of music, because, as the singer herself explains, by recounting her musical education, the \\"academic approach to music is a barrier to people actually making music\\". Oliver Sacks agrees with her by stating that the sheet music and the keys of a piano are \\"intimidating and much more complicated than language\\". Because of that, the singer tries to use technology to make it more intuitive. As a consequence of this, Bj√∂rk works with Damian Taylor. Taylor tries to use a ball and a cardboard box, along with a gamepad, instead of a keyboard. Bj√∂rk's solution came with the diffusion of tablet computer, which touch screen the singer compares to a tambourine for its being spontaneous and instinctive. By developing this idea, she decides to make a different format of album, made with apps. She works with interactive media artist Scott Snibbe, who states that her aim is the turn music \\"into something full sensory\\". Bj√∂rk explains some of the apps that are part of the album, like \\"Moon\\", which app deals with sequences, \\"Mutual Core\\", in which chords are represented with strata, and \\"Thunderbolt\\", which use lightnings as visual representation of arpeggios. Bj√∂rk states that a famous example of arpeggio is \\"I Feel Love\\" by Donna Summer. Snibbe then affirms that, \\"if we change the visual representation, the way in which people think about music is changed\\". To engage people with her new conception of music, Bj√∂rk rolls out a programme of music workshops for children in school around the world (footage from a workshop in Buenos Aires is shown) which, as Swinton informs, is now a standard part of the music curriculum in Iceland. Bj√∂rk confesses that she always dreamt about running a music school and that she considers this project her music school. After one year from the first show in Manchester, the Biophilia Tour reaches the World Sacred Music Festival in Fes, Morocco, during which Bj√∂rk is seen performing \\"Cosmogony\\". Sacks finally states that \\"music unify people at an elementary level\\". The documentary ends with a final conversation between Bj√∂rk and Attenborough, in which the naturalist affirms: > \\"Music, to be most rewarding, [...] does require work, and does require > concentration, does require thought, which is why your music is so > challenging, because it does require thought. So much of what you do, is > completely new, [and] hasn't been done by people before, and that's what's > challenging about that. So, if you're very tired, I don't suggest that they > put on your music. I put on your music when I really want to think about > something.\\" To which Bj√∂rk blushes, and then the pair laugh together. The end credits roll to \\"Cosmogony\\" in the background.  Reception  = Critical reviews = The documentary received moderately positive reviews. According to Ceri Radford of The Telegraph, who gave the documentary 4 stars out of 5, \\"the documentary brought together the revered naturalist and the swan-donning Icelandic singer for an inspiring if at times confusing symposium on the relationship between music, technology and the natural world\\". The journalist praised Biophilia by affirming that \\"the whole idea was tantalisingly tangled\\" and that \\"any single aspect of Biophilia would have made for a fascinating documentary in its own right\\", while defining the parts with Oliver Sacks \\"touching\\" and concluding \\"from footage of spinning stars to shoals of fish to the snow-speckled hills above Reykjav√≠k, from the sound of crackling electricity to Bj√∂rk's soaring voice, there was a dreamy and unsettling evocation of awe. It might not all have made sense, but it was a delight to the senses.\\" Jordan Morgan of Tomorrow's News defined the couple \\"the most unlikely expectations of collaborations\\" but goes on by stating \\"When Bjork met David Attenborough is a fascinating, albeit slightly confusing, documentary that joins the translucent dots between humans, nature and music and provides for an extremely informative learning lesson, [...] as well as creating something new to hear, Bj√∂rk also sets out to create a visual image for what people are hearing, adding another dimension to what you hear\\". Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote that, although he \\"[doesn't] always totally understand what she's on about, [...] the bits with David Attenborough at the Natural History Museum are lovely\\", and later compared their interaction to \\"an old man showing his granddaughter round his favourite place in the world\\" but found Bj√∂rk \\"a little bit shy with him\\" and \\"grand-daughterly\\". Caitlin Moran of The Times called the duo \\"a proper super-hero pairing\\". Ian Cross, professor of music and science of the University of Cambridge, commented about the documentary: \\"if there has to be something about music on television on a Saturday evening, I‚Äôd rather hear the views of Bj√∂rk and David Attenborough than those of the music hedge fund manager Simon Cowell\\". Mike Higgins, who gave the show 2 stars out of 5, writing on The Independent, billed the encounter as \\"awkward\\" and gave a negative review of the documentary, finding it \\"[not] much more than a promo for Bj√∂rk's last album, Biophilia, and its tour\\" and further stating: \\"The 87-year-old doesn't so much speak in complete paragraphs as lectures in complete chapters. In their conversations ‚Äì on crystallography, the power of the human larynx, et al ‚Äì Attenborough was in transmit mode, jabbing away with his index finger. All Bj√∂rk could do was chip in now and then, in her Reykjav√≠k by way of south London accent. When the big man let rip on the notion that all \\"song\\" in the natural word is about sex, and so, therefore, is popular music, Bj√∂rk reacted as we all did, I suspect, and looked a bit embarrassed.\\" = Ratings = The documentary pulled 528,000 viewers during its original outing at 7 p.m. with a viewing share of 3.15%. It failed to match Channel 4 average slot score of 864,000 viewers and 4.11% share for the previous 12 months. It got beaten by a rerun of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony on BBC Three, which got 825,000 viewers with an average share of 4.5%.

He moved to the region about 1814, well before Indian Removal beginning in the 1830s, and served as the United States Indian Agent to the Chickasaw under two presidents. He developed a plantation and was a slaveholder. He became active in territorial and state politics, serving as a state senator and also as a state representative. Early life and education Born in Bedford County, Virginia in 1775, Terrell was born into a planter and slaveholding family. His father Harry Terrell who later served as a captain in the Revolutionary War. He was the grandson of Joel Terrell from Richmond, Virginia, a man of Quaker ancestry, and his wife. He was probably tutored in the skills he would need to run a plantation. Harry Terrell moved his family from Hanover Court House, Virginia, to North Carolina, no doubt taking many of his slaves with him. After a short stint in Lower Sauratown, an abandoned Indian village on the Dan River in northeastern Rockingham County, he moved to Pendleton District (now Pickens and Anderson counties), South Carolina. He settled and farmed a plot of ground along the Big Eastatoe Creek. As a veteran the father had been entitled to a land grant in lieu of payment for his service. But it was not until after his death in 1798 that some of his children applied for this land bounty. John D. Terrell Sr. moved with his family into Franklin County, Georgia. After failed business ventures there, he moved again in ca. 1814 into Marion County, Alabama. (It was then known as Tuscaloosa County and was part of the Alabama Territory. With enslaved labor, he developed a plantation near the Military Ford along the Buttahatchee River. Plantations were developed along waterways in order to have transportation access, and also because of the fertility of the lowlands. This site was immediately south of present-day Hamilton (formerly called Toll Gate), and seven miles north of Pikeville. In 1813, Terrell had Power of Attorney to apply for a land warrant from the United States on behalf of his siblings and him. In 1817, they were allotted 5,333 acres of land, twenty- three hundred of which was in the State of Ohio; they sold it for fifty cents per acre.Emma Dicken, Terrell Genealogy, San Antonio (1952), p.113. Terrell reportedly boarded some of the troops of General Andrew Jackson while Jackson's Military Road was being constructed from Natchez to Nashville, from 1816-1820. Some of the workers had camped at the Military Ford of the Buttahatchee River, a place along the route. The ford had a rock and sand bottom for easy crossing.John M. Allman III (ed.), \\"An Abbreviated History of Marion County, Ala.\\", Alabama Tracks, vol. XI #4, The Marion County Historical & Genealogical Societies, 1992. Political career In northern Alabama, Terrell soon became politically active. He was a delegate from Marion at the Alabama Constitutional Convention in Huntsville, on July 5, 1819 to draft a constitution for the pending state.The Heritage of Marion County, Alabama, vol. 47, Clanton, Al: 2000, p. 1 He was a signatory to Alabama's first Constitution.The Journal of the Convention of the Alabama Territory begun July 5, 1819. See: Also published in the Alabama Historical Quarterly, vol. XXXI. In 1819 he was elected as the first state senator from Marion County. In 1822, Terrell was elected as a State Representative from Marion County. He was appointed as the first Marion Territorial judge, and was said to have administered the sworn oath of office to all county officers at Cotton Gin Port, a trading post with the Chickasaw located on the east bank of the Tombigbee River. (Then part of Marion County, it is now in Mississippi). Beginning about 1825 and perhaps extending into the early 1830s, Terrell served as the U.S. Government Chickasaw Indian Agent for that region under presidents John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. He also surveyed Chickasaw lands on behalf of the federal government in what are now the states of Alabama and Mississippi. President Jackson intended to force the Indians out. Levi Colbert, head chief of the Chickasaw nation, was one of his most respected friends. He had given Terrell his first year's supply of corn when he was new to the region.Dr. W.A. Evans of Aberdeen, MS., Aberdeen Examiner, July 2, 1936 (from John Mitchell Allman III, The Heritage of Lamar County, Alabama). Terrell was tasked with trying to persuade the Chickasaw to cede their lands and resettle west of the Mississippi River. Under the Indian Removal Act of 1830, they were forced by the US government in 1837 to move west.In a written report communicated to the US Senate on January 15, 1827, which report was dated November 2, 1826 and where it mentions the failed Choctaw negotiations in that month, as well as the Chickasaw negotiations in the previous month, it is written: \\"The special agent, Colonel John D. Terrell, seems to have been active and zealous in communicating with the chiefs and leading men of the nation, endeavoring to prepare their minds for a cession of their lands. But it seems to have no other effect than to prepare them for an organized opposition to the views of the Government, through the influence before observed...\\" The report was signed by General Thomas Hinds and General John Coffee. Personal life Terrell was a Baptist, later to join the \\"Missionary Baptists.\\" He belonged to the Whig party. In 1795, John married Lydia Briscoe Warren of North Carolina. They had four sons and five daughters together. Their eldest son was Edward Garland Terrell (born ca. 1797); another notable son was John Dabney Terrell Jr. (1804‚Äì1885), who served as Probate Judge of Marion County for more than forty years. Both men were slaveholders until the end of the Civil War. Terrell is said to have disinherited his son William Henry Terrell, for becoming a Presbyterian and a Democrat.Based on a family sketch written for the Alabama State Archives on 24 July 1916 by John Mitchell Allman II (b. 1859). Terrell may have put some of his slave property under the name of his son John Dabney Terrell Jr., in order to avoid a pending law suit against him in Tennessee. If it was decided against him, he could lose his property in payment of damages. Terrell died on May 10, 1850, at the age of seventy-five. His slave property was inherited by his wife, Lydia. At her death in 1853, most of the registered enslaved persons were inherited by eldest son Edward Garland Terrell. John D. Terrell Jr. retained his own enslaved Black workers. During Terrell's life, he had at times given some of his slaves to other of his children, as recorded in legal deeds now held in the Alabama State Archives. In many families, parents gave slaves as wedding or birthday gifts to their children, or to help them as workers when they were starting out. At his request, Terrell was buried in a sitting posture in a walnut coffin made somewhat like a chair. His grave was dug deep within one of three Indian mounds located at Military Ford, on the south side.These Indians mounds are located in lands of Section 14, in Township 11, of Range 14W, on the State Highway Map of Marion County. They can be accessed by driving I-22 (US 78) in Marion County, and taking exit 16, which merges onto US 43 N. Drive along US 43 N for 1.8 miles, then turn right (east) onto Old Indian Mound Road. He was buried in a panther vest (given to him by an Indian chieftain), with a blanket spread over his shoulders, and accompanied by grave goods: a gun, water bucket and dipper, wash pan, and hand towels. This was a custom among some Native American tribes and other cultures. The old Terrell homestead and plantation is said to have been located just off Interstate Hwy. 22 (US 78), where it crosses the Buttahatchie River on the way into Hamilton. This area is near the outskirts of town, the Indian Mounds, and a park developed in the 20th century.

She is especially associated with the role of Alice Ford in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff, a role which she performed more than 400 times on stage during her career. She is also remembered for being the first soprano to record the role of Mimi in Giacomo Puccini's La boheme in 1917. She also made complete recordings of Gounod's Faust and Lehar's The Merry Widow. After retiring from performance in 1930, she devoted herself to teaching singing and managing the career of her husband, baritone Mariano Stabile. Life and career Born in Milan, Bosini studied singing in her native city with Salvatore Pessina. She made her professional opera debut in 1909 as Mimi in Giacomo Puccini's La boheme at the Politaema Marengo in Novi Ligure. Later that year she toured to Quito, Ecuador where she was heard as Mimi at the Teatro Sucre. She sang Mimi several more times during her career, including performances at the Teatro Petruzzelli in Bari (1911), the Teatro Rendano in Cosenza (1912), the Politeama Rossini in Tunis (1913), the Teatro Biondo in Palermo (1914), the Teatro Apollo in Bologna (1917), the Politeama Chiarella in Turin (1918), and the Liceu in Barcelona (1919). In 1917 she became the first person to record the role of Mimi, singing the role on disc with the Orchestra and Chorus of La Scala under conductor Carlo Sabajno.March et al. (2009) p. 806 For two decades Bosini actively performed in opera houses throughout Italy, and was most frequently seen at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo where she made her debut in 1915 as Antonia in The Tales of Hoffmann. It was while doing that production that she met her husband, acclaimed baritone Mariano Stabile (1888‚Äì1968). Other Italian opera houses she performed at during her career were the Teatro della Pergola in Florence, the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi in Trieste, and the Teatro Metastasio in Prato among others. Outside of Italy, she appeared at the Liceu in Barcelona in 1918 as Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni; returning there several times over the next two years. She also gave performances at the Cairo Opera House and the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires as Alice Ford in Verdi's Falstaff. Her last appearance was as Alice Ford at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo in 1930. Bosini sang a wide range of parts during her career. Other roles she created on stage included Cio-Cio-San in Madama Butterfly, Desdemona in Otello, Elsa in Lohengrin, a flower maiden in Parsifal, Hanna Glawari in The Merry Widow, Maria in Guglielmo Ratcliff, Margherita in Mefistofele, Marguerita in Faust, Micaela in Carmen, Nedda in Pagliacci, and the title roles of Giordano's Fedora, Mascagni's Iris, Massenet's Manon, and Puccini's Manon Lescaut and Tosca. After retiring from the stage in 1930, Bosini taught singing in Milan and managed her husband's career. She and her husband lived their latter years at the Casa di Riposo per Musicisti in Milan.

Her main research interests include moral philosophy, moral psychology, and philosophical issues in criminal law. Baron is an associate editor of Inquiry, a member of the editorial board of The International Encyclopedia of Ethics, a series editor for New Directions in Ethics, and a member of the editorial board of the North American Kant Studies in Philosophy. Education and career Baron received her baccalaureate from Oberlin College in 1976, and went on to receive a master's and doctoral degree from the University of North Carolina in 1978 and 1982, respectively. After receiving her doctorate, Baron accepted an appointment as an Assistant Professor at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and an appointment as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She accepted a permanent offer from UIUC in 1983, was promoted to Associate Professor in 1989, and to full Professor in 1996. In 2001, she moved to Indiana University - Bloomington as a full professor, and she was named the Rudy Professor in 2004. In 2012 she accepted an additional appointment as Professor at the University of St. Andrews, while retaining her position at Indiana as well. She retains an honorary professorship there. Besides for her permanent positions, Baron has also held visiting positions at a variety of institutions, including Illinois State University, Stanford University, the University of Michigan, the University of Chicago, the University of Melbourne, the University of Auckland, and Dartmouth College. Research areas Baron's research has focused on moral philosophy, moral psychology, the philosophical issues of criminal law, impartiality in ethics, as well as Immanuel Kant (whom she has authored two books on) and David Hume. Baron has written extensively about topics such as apparent conflicts between different types of interpersonal relationships, manipulativeness, justifications and excuses, the moral significance of appearances, and the ethics of Kant and Hume. She has also written about a wide variety of topics related to philosophical issues of criminal law, including writing several papers on potential defenses to bodily crimes, issues surrounding mens rea (including whether or not mens rea can be satisfied by negligence,) and the standards of control and reasonableness that people should be held to (cf. the \\"reasonable person\\".) Publications Baron has written or co-written two books and is working on a third - Three Methods of Ethics: A Debate in 1997, and Kantian Ethics Almost without Apology in 1995. Baron's upcoming book, tentatively titled Self-Defense, Reason, and the Law, focuses on the reasonable belief requirement as it pertains to self- defense. She has also published around four dozen papers, one monograph, five encyclopedia articles, and a host of book reviews. In Three Methods of Ethics, Baron's contribution focused providing a limited defense of Immanuel Kant, attempting to demonstrate that a Kantian position is superior to that espoused by virtue ethicists. In Kantian Ethics, Baron attempts to provide a limited defense of Kantian ethics intended for a broader audience than those who are already Kantians. Kantian Ethics tries to directly address two widely perceived problems in Kant's positions; first, the idea that Kant's ethics leave no room for superogatory actions, and second, that Kant places too much emphasis on the idea of duty.

Surviving elements of the Imperial Japanese Army who had been driven into the Pegu Yoma attempted to break out eastwards, to join other Japanese troops retreating from the British forces. The break-out was the objective of the Japanese Twenty-Eighth Army with support at first from the Thirty-third Army and later the Fifteenth Army. As a preliminary, the Japanese Thirty-third Army attacked Allied positions in the Sittang Bend, near the mouth of the river, to distract the Allies. The British had been alerted to the break-out attempt and it ended calamitously for the Japanese, who suffered many losses, with some formations being wiped out. Around 14,000 Japanese were lost, with well over half being killed, while British forces suffered only 95 killed and 322 wounded. The break-out attempt and the ensuing battle became the last significant land battle of the Western powers in the Second World War.Tucker p 60 Background By early 1944, the British forces in India had been reinforced and had expanded their supply infrastructure, which made it possible for them to contemplate an attack into Burma. The Japanese attempted to forestall them by an invasion of India (Operation U-Go), which led to a great Japanese defeat and other setbacks in Northern Burma.Slim, p. 368 Following a further defeat at the hands of William Slim and the Fourteenth Army at Meiktila and Mandalay and Operation Dracula, the recapture of Rangoon, the Japanese were further handicapped in their defence of Burma.Allen, pp. 479‚Äì480 By this time the Burmese National Army under Aung San had switched sides (becoming the Burma Patriotic Army) and was hunting down Japanese patrols and foraging parties.Farquharson pp 298‚Äì300 During April, the British and Indian IV Corps advanced from Central Burma down the valley of the Sittang River. Japanese rearguards prevented them advancing all the way to Rangoon, the capital and main port of Burma but on 2 May, Rangoon fell to an Allied amphibious landing (Operation Dracula). On 6 May, the leading troops of 17th Division, leading the IV Corps advance, linked up with the troops who had carried out Dracula at Hlegu north east of Rangoon. After the fall of Rangoon, the Fourteenth Army HQ under Slim moved to Ceylon to plan operations to recapture Malaya and Singapore. A new Twelfth Army headquarters under Lieutenant-General Montagu Stopford was formed from XXXIII Corps HQ. It took over IV Corps in the Sittang valley and directly commanded some divisions in the Irrawaddy valley.Allen, p 480 The Japanese Twenty-Eighth Army under Lieutenant General Sh≈çz≈ç Sakurai, after retreating from Arakan and the Irrawaddy valley, had reached the Pegu Yomas, a range of low mountains, hills and uplands between the Irrawaddy and the Sittang River in central Burma.Seekins, Donald M. (2006) Historical dictionary of Burma (Myanmar) Scarecrow Press, Lanham, Maryland, p 357, They were joined by Major General Hideji Matsui's 105th Independent Mixed Brigade, also known as \\"Kani\\" Force (men of anti-aircraft batteries, airfield construction battalions, naval anchorage units and NCO schools) which had faced IV Corps. The Japanese trapped in the Pegu Yomas prepared a break-out operation to rejoin the Burma Area Army and escape into Thailand with them. The Sittang was unfordable and was therefore a significant military barrier, as it had been in 1942 during the first Burma campaign.Slim 1956, p. 18. General Heitar≈ç Kimura, the commander of Burma Area Army, ordered the Thirty-Third Army to cover this break-out by a diversionary offensive across the Sittang, although the entire army could muster the strength of barely a brigade. In support, the Fifteenth Army were to co-ordinate their efforts with the Twenty-eighth Army, if the operation was failing to meet its objective. Operation Map of the Japanese break-out at Pegu British intelligence were aware of the intended break-out but had no detailed information, so Stopford ordered General Frank Messervy the IV Corps commander to spread the corps over more than a hundred miles of front to block their way. On 2 July 1945 a Gurkha patrol ambushed and wiped out a small Japanese force and captured a dispatch bag containing the complete operational plan for the Japanese break-out. The intelligence was quickly distributed among the British forces, which had two weeks to prepare. One of the intended Japanese routes of march lay directly across the 17th Indian Division headquarters at Penwegon and Messervy reinforced this critical sector with 64th Indian Brigade from the 19th Indian Division. The Japanese planned to advance to the Sittang in three columns, under strict rules of engagement forbidding use of firearms in favour of the bayonet and forbidding any radio communication, once they had crossed the Sittang on rafts mostly made of bamboo. Sakurai underestimated the British strength arrayed against him but believed he could get over half his force across in fighting shape. =1st Battle= The Japanese Thirty-third Army attacked the Sittang Bend on 3 July 1945, attempting to assist the break-out. The attack was mistimed, taking place a week before the Twenty-eighth Army made its advance to the river. The Japanese were allowed to advance, unaware that their plans were known to the British, until many of their troops were in exposed positions and then a barrage of shell fire and bombing started. Artillery bombarded the Japanese attack; Royal Artillery forward observation officers (FOOs) continually monitored Japanese movements and gave the signal to fire. Royal Air Force cab rank patrols under the direction of visual control posts, called upon squadrons of Spitfires and Thunderbolts on Japanese targets. The destruction on 4 July of three 105 mm guns by the Thunderbolts of No. 42 Squadron was an example of air power success. By 7 July, Kimura ordered Thirty-third Army, having suffered casualties, to halt operations and pulled them back hoping it would be enough to enable the Twenty-eighth army to break-out. The British knew of this anyway and switched their attention to that sector. =Battle of the Breakout= On 15 July the Twenty-Eighth Army, despite the mistiming of the Thirty-third Army's attack, began their break-out attempt, unaware that the British knew of their plans. The monsoon had begun and the British created two killing fields, the first for artillery (targeting twelve Japanese crossing points along the highway) and the second using aircraft (which were able to fly even in poor weather conditions) to attack those who managed to cross the road, especially between the Sittang and the Salween rivers. FOOs were used in the air and the ground. Tanks and infantry motorised and on foot, covered the gaps between the positions despite the monsoon. The Allied Patriotic Burma Forces would deal with any survivors on the east bank of the Sittang. As such, the Japanese 55th Division ran straight into the 19th Indian Division strong point at Penwegon; tanks and infantry repelled every attack inflicting huge losses. British forward observation officers on the far side of the Sittang, continued to call down artillery fire on the Japanese as the survivors attempted to reform and move south; casualties were appalling and it was in reality a one-sided battle. The RAF had also attacked troop concentrations and river craft of all kinds; 273 Squadron and 607 Squadron had killed about 500 Japanese in the village of Hpa-An, when British and Burmese troops came in to take control. The 600 men of the Japanese 13th Naval Guard Force broke out separate from the main body, due to confusion and ambushes and only a handful survived. On 21 July the Japanese began the last and most desperate attempt to cross the Sittang with the remaining 10,000 troops, many of whom were sick. The 54th Division having suffered heavily from cholera and dysentery, stepped off from the Pegu Yomas and crossed the flooded paddy fields to the Sittang. Every available Allied tank, gun, mortar and machine gun was at once thrown in against them and despite low clouds and heavy rains, every squadron which was able to sortie. The Thunderbolt could carry three bombs and the Spitfire a bomb and these played havoc among concentrations of moving Japanese troops. Many incidents occurred where RAF ground observers exposed themselves to friendly fire. A visual Controller, Flight Lieutenant J. Taylor and a corporal, were able to direct around seventeen aircraft at a time on to targets only from their post ‚Äì both were wounded by bomb-splinters from RAF fighter-bombers. With British guns, in particular the devastation caused by the 5.5-inch, 4.5-inch and the 25-pounders already shelling the routes, the Japanese were slaughtered and this would last until the end of July.

The Japanese Fifteenth Army then stepped in to help the shattered survivors of the 28th Army. The Karen guerrillas were able to ambush hundreds of Japanese soldiers and attack elements from the Fifteenth Army. The Allied liaison organisation Force 136 operated with them and used Westland Lysanders to remove the seriously wounded, prisoners and documents and bring in urgent stores. They provided targets not only for Spitfires and Thunderbolts but called on the Beaufighters and Mosquitos of the Tactical Air Force. By 29 July, the Fifteenth Army retired, realising that the break-out was a disaster but had succeeded in at least rescuing a number of scattered groups. By the time the battle had died down only a few Japanese units made it across, having reached the Sittang by 7 August before the whole area was cleared by Allied infantry. Aftermath Japanese prisoners from the battle are searched, 30 July 1945. The break-out was a dismal failure and sapped Japanese morale further; the ragged elements were continually harassed by Karen guerrillas and the RAF. Messervy and Stopford described the break-out as a heroic effort and stated that most of the 740 prisoners were taken only because they were incapable of further effort, highlighting the tenacity of the Japanese soldier even when starved and disease ridden.Hearn p viii Of the Japanese losses the unit that suffered the lowest percentage of casualties was in the 105th Independent Mixed Brigade, of 4,173 men more than 2,000 got across the Sittang. The 13th Naval Guard Force was annihilated, with only a handful of its original 600 men escaping. A substantial number, at least 70 and perhaps more, deserted while still in the Pegu Yomas. This force suffered the heaviest casualties of any formation in this costly operation. The 54th Division had suffered huge losses, more than 5,000 were lost breaking out across the Sittang. Of the 9,000 men of the 55th division that started the break-out, fewer than 4,000 made it to the Tenasserim. Out of 18,000 men directly controlled by Twenty-eighth Army less than 6,000 in total managed to reach the east bank of the Sittang. The British and Allied forces in addition to having claimed 1,500 being sick to disease throughout the period had suffered no more than 95 men killed and 322 wounded, a small number of these coming from 'friendly fire'. The Royal Air Force flew a total of 3,045 sorties and dropped some of bombs. The loss of so many Japanese troops was largely due to British air power and artillery fire; to the soldiers that fought here they coined the battle a gunners war. With this defeat, the Japanese Burma Area Army was reduced to an ineffective fighting force. With the majority of Burma liberated, word that Japan had surrendered on 15 August only increased the anxiety of the Japanese to get to the Tenasserim hills. They did not however wish to be immobilised on the eastern bank of the Sittang so another 2,000 more died after the battle had been fought, many in the first days of peace. It was the last big battle on land of World War II involving the Western Allies. On 13 September 1945, the remaining units of the once formidable Japanese Burma Area Army surrendered to the British.Topich & Leitich p 69  References  ;Citations ;Bibliography     External links * JAPANESE BREAKOUT FROM THE PEGU YOMAS TO THE EAST (21/7/1945) Category:World War II operations and battles of the Southeast Asia Theatre Category:Military history of Burma during World War II Category:1945 in India Category:1945 in Burma Category:Land battles of World War II involving the United Kingdom Category:July 1945 events Category:August 1945 events ","title":"Battle of the Sittang Bend"},{"id":"42355133","text":"Allium ebusitanum is a plant species known from the Spanish Island of Ibiza in the Balearic Islands, as well as from Tunisia and Algeria.P√≠o Font Quer. 1924.

Life  Near contemporary drawing of Edith. Wulfthryth was an English noblewoman, a cousin of Wulfhild, born about 937, whom King Edgar of England carried off from the nunnery at Wilton Abbey and took to his residence at Kemsing, near Sevenoaks.Stephen Morillo, The Haskins Society Journal (Boydell Press, 2003), page 97 While in Kent, Wulfthryth gave birth to a daughter, Edith.Pauline Stafford, Queen Emma & Queen Edith (Blackwell, 2001), pp. 324-325 After at least a year, Wulfthryth returned to Wilton Abbey, taking Edith with her.Mrs Jameson, Legends of the monastic orders: as represented in the fine arts, p. 95 She later became head of the abbey and outlived her daughter. According to early monastic texts, under Saint Dunstan's direction Edgar did penance for this crime by not wearing his crown for seven years.Ann Williams, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004), (Edgar Pacificus), accessed 16 May 2012 (Subscription site) As part of his penance, Edgar gave Wilfrida six estates in Wiltshire and the Isle of Wight which she passed on to Wilton Abbey in 965AD. Wulfthryth at OxfordDNB (Subscription site) Some form of bride abduction, often more simulated force than actual, by this time, may have existed as a vestige of earlier Anglo-Saxon tradition, and historians have alternatively referred to Wilfrida as Edgar's concubine or his second wife, although never as a captive. Given the religious customs of the time, his penance was probably related to his violation of the sanctity of her religious vocation, rather than to any personal affront to Wilfrida. It is clear that the two may have had a continuing friendship long after her return to Wilton. In any event, Edgar seems to have acknowledged Edith as his daughter; the relationship may have been considered a marriage, despite the formal church sanction, as was the custom of the time, and if so Edith was a legitimate daughter. Wulfthryth continued to have considerable influence upon Edgar after her return to Wilton. She was able to stop bailiffs from arresting a thief who had taken sanctuary in the AbbeyStephen Morillo, The Haskins Society Journal (Boydell Press, 2003)page 112 and was able to secure the release of two Wilton priests who had been imprisoned by the reeve of Wilton.Gwen Seabourne, Imprisoning Medieval Women: The Non-judicial Confinement and Abduction of Women in England, c. 1170-1509 (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2011) page 184 As Abbess of Wilton, she built a stone wall around the Abbey and also used her wealth to build up the abbey's collection of relics.

He took office on January 2, 2015, after winning the Democratic Party primary and following general election in 2014 and won re-election in 2018. Early years and education Charles Allen grew up in the Birmingham, Alabama suburb of Homewood and graduated from Homewood High School. Allen is married to Jordi Hutchinson. The couple has a daughter and a son. Allen graduated from Washington and Lee University. The summer after his sophomore year, he interned at a free clinic in South Boston. He earned a master's degree from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Political career Allen was hired as director of public policy for the District of Columbia Primary Care Association in 2003. The following year, Allen served as the Ward 6 coordinator for Howard Dean's presidential campaign. He was a delegate for Dean at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. As chairman of the grass roots Democratic organization D.C. for Democracy, Allen sent hundreds of District residents to other states to campaign. Allen resigned from the District of Columbia Primary Care Association to manage Tommy Wells' campaign for the Ward 6 seat on the Council of the District of Columbia in 2006. After Wells won the election, Wells hired Allen as his chief of staff. Allen was president of the Ward 6 Democrats from 2009 to 2013. While president, the group voted to urge the Council of the District of Columbia to pass a law legalizing same-sex marriage. In 2012, the D.C. Democratic State Committee chose the person to replace Phil Mendelson as at-large council member for 70 days before a special election was held. Allen was opposed to the process, saying that only the voters should choose the replacement for an at-large vacancy, not a small group of party committee members. 2014 election Allen was the chief of staff of Ward 6 Council Member Tommy Wells. After Wells decided not to run for reelection in order to run for mayor, Allen resigned from his position and announced his candidacy to succeed Wells seat in the Council representing Ward 6. Darrel Thompson, a former deputy chief of staff of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, also ran in the Democratic primary. Pranav Badhwar ran in the Libertarian primary. When campaigning, Allen emphasized his work helping Ward 6 working for Wells, saying that gave him extensive knowledge and experience about Ward 6. Allen opposed the Large Retailer Accountability Act, which would have increased the minimum wage for large businesses located in the District, preferring instead an across-the- board minimum wage increase as opposed to a bill that only targeted large retailers. Allen also did not access donations to his campaign from corporations. Allen also criticized Thompson, saying Thompson's work has kept him focused on Nevada rather than the District, using the fact that Thompson has not voted in several District elections to make his case. Thompson responded saying that he knew the District well because he was born in the District, unlike Allen. Thompson called Allen the \\"anointed candidate\\", a reference to Wells' choosing his own successor and labeling Allen as a political insider. Thompson also says that Allen is effectively asking for more time to carry out Wells' agenda that should have been completed during Wells' eight years on the Council. Allen was endorsed by the editorial board of The Washington Post, Service Employees International Union, D.C. for Democracy, D.C. Chamber of Commerce PAC, the D.C. Chapter of the National Organization for Women, the D.C. Association of Realtors, Clean Slate Now, the local firefighters' union, and the local police officers' union. The local American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees endorsed Thompson. Allen and his treasurer Patrick Johnson opted for a campaign finance model that did not accept corporate donations. This was consistent with Allen's championing of campaign finance reform, having been a supporter of DC's Initiative 70 in 2012.

He developed auto racing engines, and is especially well known for his work for Peugeot and Ballot, who dominated Grand Prix auto racing from 1912 to 1921. His engine design directly influenced Sunbeam Racing cars as early as 1914; the 1921 Grand Prix Sunbeams owe much to his work with Ballot and the 1922 Grand Prix Sunbeams were designed by him. His engine operational architecture was the precursor of modern engines. One biographer called him \\"perhaps the most brilliant engine designer ever\\"; another described one of his designs as \\"so technically advanced it could have landed from outer space\\". Henry's \\"theory, design and execution\\" of twin-cam engines was to guide engine development in Europe and then around the world for the next century. Early life and education After studying Applied Mechanics at Technicum (School of Engineering) in Geneva, Ernest Henry worked starting in 1906 on marine engines for Picker of Geneva, then moved to Paris in 1909, serving the Motos Labor manufacturing company (marine and aviation engines), before joining the ranks of Peugeot in 1911. At Peugeot Robert Peugeot integrate it shortly after the team called \\"Les Charlatans\\" (a name given to the team by technical managers at the Peugeot factory in Beaulieu and who were opposed to this conception of race car), then composed the official Peugeot drivers Jules Goux, Georges Boillot and Paul Zuccarelli, who had left Hispano- Suiza. This group had managed to convince Robert Peugeot, whose firm Lion- Peugeot had, in 1910, merged with institutions Peugeot of Audincourt, and this new leader of business, engage in the study and the financing of project race car, modern, for the Grand Prix of the Automobile Club de France (ACF) and the Coupe de l'Auto of 1912. Ernest Henry, who was then 27 years old, started from a drawing board and a blank page in the racing department, working in secret in Suresnes (in Rossel's former factory), with a budget allocated by the Peugeot factory Through skill and ingenuity Ernest Henry would materialize innovative ideas and sometimes a little iconoclastic team. He wanted to get high speeds through the use of double camshaft in head-driven shaft with a bevel at each end. The engine born in early 1912 featured inclined actuating four valves for each of the four cylinders, a very good four-cylinder twin camshaft cylinder head with hemispherical combustion chambers, 4 valves per cylinder arranged in V, and 7.6 liter capacity. As the chassis of this car was also much lighter and held the road better than the monsters of the early ages, the new Peugeot first grand prix car, quickly became the car to beat, with improved tires it could reach . These cars would be entered at the French Grand Prix: the type L76 (L for Lion) unlimited class, with a displacement of 7.6 liters, and the type L3 for three-liter restricted Coupe de l'Auto competition. Peugeot L76 and L3 emerged as winners of the 1912 French Grand Prix in Dieppe, the Mont Ventoux Hill Climb (the record), the Coupe de l'Auto, Circuit of Ardennes, the meeting of Boulogne, and Coupe de la Sarthe. Thus the ideas of the team and the quality of work done by Ernest Henry achieved victory over everything before them. With these engines, Ernest Henry may claim the undisputed paternity landmark in the history of the automobile. They are not the first \\"4 valves per cylinder\\" or the first \\"dual overhead cam head,\\" but they are the first in the world to combine the two techniques. All the most powerful racing engines, to the current Formula 1 recapitulate this formula, which is now becoming universal in production automobiles. In 1913, the 5.6 liter and 3 liter engines were further developed with camshaft timing, previously carried by shaft and bevel, now carried out by a cascade of gears, and lubrication was amended by adding a dry sump. =World's First DOHC Motorcycle = In 1914 Henry adapted his automobile engine design for a new 500 cc straight-twin engine racing motorcycle. The Peugeot 500 M racing motorcycle was the world's first motorcycle to use a double overhead camshaft cylinder head; the twin camshafts were driven by a cascade of gears between the cylinders, and used 4 valves per cylinder. The new machine was first raced in April 1914 on the Rambouillet circuit, and in June, during the Automobile Club de France's ‚ÄòRecords Day‚Äô in Fontainebleau, it exceeded 122kmh (75 mph) over a measured kilometer and 121kmh (74 mph) over the measured mile. The engine was incredibly sophisticated for the time.Bourdache, Jean (1989). La Motocyclette en France 1894-1914. Edifree, Paris, 1989 The Peugeot factory estimates that 3 of the 1914 500M racers were built, although none appear to have survived today. The original factory drawings for this motor were discovered in 1998 by Emile Jacquinot (a documentation specialist for the Peugeot Museum) at the Peugeot family home in Valentigny. Working in concert with the Peugeot Museum, engineer Jean Boulicot built a replica of the 1914 500M over 10 years, with the finished machine debuting at the Coupe Motos Legende event in 2010.Jardy, Alain (2013). 'Peugeot 500 GP 1914', RAD Magazine, Oct, 2013 =Henry's engines in the Indianapolis 500= 1913 would be a great year in the history of Peugeot and the French automobile. On May 30 Jules Goux driving a L76 (with engine displacement reduced to 7.3 l to respect the rules of the race), won the 1913 Indianapolis 500, 804.5 km to 122.155 km/h average. This was the first victory for the French auto manufacturer in the United States, and had an enormous impact on both sides of the Atlantic, especially this victory was acquired in front of the world's automotive \\"who's who\\". The new 5.6 liter took first and second place at the French Grand Prix won at Mont Ventoux, and a streamlined L76 set a new world record speed of 170.94 km/h at Brooklands Motor Circuit and won several other records on the same circuit in the hands of Goux and Boillot. In the 1914 Indianapolis 500, 2.5 liter and 4.5 liter engines were installed, while maintaining the same technical design. Results were not as bright as in 1913, due to technical problems (especially tires) rather than mechanical. Peugeot nevertheless took second and fourth place: Arthur Duray in the 3 liter class and Jules Goux in the 5.6 liter class. Georges Boillot lead the Mercedes armada with his 4.5 liter engine until the last lap of the historic 1914 French Grand Prix run July 4, 1914, a month before the First World War. He dropped out, after taking serious risks, due to the many stops caused by defective tires. In the 1915 Indianapolis 500, Peugeot placed second with the same type vehicle as that of 1914, with the 4.5 l engine, driven by Dario Resta and won the 1916 Indianapolis 500 at an average speed of 133.994 km/h. Peugeot's third victory at Indianapolis was won in 1919 when the glorious 4.5 (1914) by Howard Wilcox and Jules Goux took first and third place respectively. The L25 won the Targa Florio in 1919. The technical advances of Henry's engine designs allowed them to win races five years after their creation. =Peugeot legacy= These performances were not to remain without notice in the United States. Peugeot's engine design had a lasting influence U.S. engineers for many years. Cars from previous campaigns remained in the United States, and were sold to American drivers, among them Harry Arminius Miller who would soon copy this exceptional mechanical architecture to overcome its cleaner engines in 4 and 8 cylinder versions, then after the bankruptcy of Miller, Fred Offenhauser who was one of Miller's employees in the 1930s. This type of engine in 4 cylinders form was used until the end of the 1970s, with the final win at Indy by Offenhauser in 1976. Ernest Henry left Peugeot in February 1915, replaced by the engineer Marcel Gr√©millon who developed a 1-liter, five valve per cylinder, triple overhead cam engine in 1920-1921. Looking back at Henry's time at Peugeot, a writer in 1921 said his cars \\"won practically all races in which they were entered\\". Post-WWI At the end of the World War I in December 1918, the driver Ren√© Thomas and Ernest Henry offered to Ernest Maurice Ballot the design of a race car that Ernest Henry had made during the war. The latter accepted and thus aimed to participate in the 1919 Indianapolis 500, the first post-war Indianapolis race. Ernest Henry had 101 days (it was in fact necessary to leave Paris no later than April 26, 1919 in order not to miss the boat) to finalize his study and create 4 complete cars for this event. These four Ballot cars, which were designed in the utmost secrecy, naturally resembled pre-war Peugeots, but Ernest Henry, who took the time during the war to improve his design before the war, resumed his sketch hemi engine with four valves per cylinder, inclined at 60¬∞, controlled by a dual overhead cam head, to equip a straight-eight engine capable of 2900 RPM and giving 150 hp for a top speed of nearly . The straight-eight engine architecture was quickly adopted in the world of motor sport (in 1921 more than half of Indianapolis contestants were straight-eights). However, during the race, repeated tire and wheel problems did not allow the high expectations set in testing. Albert Guyot finished in fourth place behind two Peugeots with Henry motors and a Stutz. The formula used for the 1920 Indianapolis 500 limited the displacement to 3 liters, so Ernest Henry conceived, according to the same technical architecture, a new straight-eight engine of 2.97 liter displacement. The maximum speed of the car was slightly reduced to , but the usability further improved, and this time the Ballot entries finished second, fifth and seventh. The brand Ballot was the only one to represent France at the 1921 French Grand Prix at Le Mans in July, with three eight-cylinder cars and a new four- cylinder 2 liter engine designed by Ernest Henry also participated in the race. De Palma finished second behind the Duesenberg driven by the American Murphy, and the two came third with Jules Goux at over 110 km/h average! The British STD Combine was represented by two Talbot and two Talbot Darracq- all four were in fact, Sunbeam Grand Prix the design of which was largely Henry's. After this exploit Ballot, dubbed by Charles Faroux, the father of two liters, decided to build in series which was to be the LS type 2, with a 2-liter four- cylinder engine with a two-camshaft, 8-valve head, which he continued manufacturing until 1924, despite its high price due to its refined design and careful construction. Also in 1921, the 8-cylinders distinguished themselves at the Italian Grand Prix played at Brescia and won by Jules Goux on a 3 l. Ernest Henry left for Sunbeam-Talbot-Darracq in December 1921, following an offer of Louis Coatalen to design the Sunbeam 2-liter Grand Prix in 1922. He directed the racing team group, in Darracq Suresnes. He then moved to the automaker Omega, it appears he left in 1924. Later life Henry's life following his career is less well known, mainly because of the very nature of his quiet character. He worked as a craftsman at home, and it seems that he did no more engine work after 1920. At the time of his death in 1950 at the age of sixty-five years, he worked in an engineering company Levallois near Paris.

Contemporary historians and humanists consider her to be one of the most important 20th-century public figures in Chile. Biography Elena Caffarena was born in Iquique, Chile to Ana Morice and Blas Caffarena, an Italian immigrant. When Caffarena was young the family moved to Santiago from Iquique. Caffarena attended the University of Chile, and her time there was very influential in her career. When at college in her sophomore year she worked at Defensa Jur√≠dica Gratuita (English: Free Legal Defense). During this work she met her husband, Jorge Jiles. Caffarena devoted much of her life to the struggle for women's emancipation. Her granddaughter is the journalist Pamela Jiles. Caffarena died on July 19, 2003 at the age of 100.  Career and MEMCh  Caffarena and Olga Poblete were the founders of Movimiento Pro-Emancipaci√≥n de las Mujeres de Chile (MEMCh) (English: Pro- Emancipation Movement of Chilean Women) in 1938 and were honored as \\"founding matriarchs\\" by MEMCh 1983. The MEMCh fought for many different women's rights issues including, workers rights, abortion rights, breastfeeding and also decreasing infant mortality rates. The main motivations of Caffarena and MEMCh were to increase democracy in Chile this is within and outside of the home. The MEMCh's goal was not to completely over through the social system but to point out the flaws in the system. MEMCh created a monthly bulletin called La Mujer Nueva that covers a range of topics from discussing the issues faced during daily life of women to international politics. Caffarena herself was a major advocate for women to be financially independent from their husbands. Caffarena was very curious about what the possible reason could be to keep women out of politics. During the Pinochet Dictatorship (1973-1990), Caffarena ran a series of organizations out of her own house, which was within a Seminary. Two of the organizations she founded and ran Comit√© de Defensa de los Derechos del Pueblo (CODEPU) (English: Committee in Defense of the Rights of the People), and Fundaci√≥n para la Protecci√≥n de la Infancia Da√±ada por los Estados de Emergencia (PIDEE) (English: Foundation for the Protection of Children Damaged by States of Emergency). Both of these organizations goals was to help the repressed under Augusto Pinochet. Her work let her interface with politicians. An example of this is when President Gonz√°lez Videla was speaking to the Second National Congress of Women, Caffarena and her followers were in attendance. At one point during his speech he mentioned that he would use the army against the Chilean people for order to remain. At this point in the speech Caffarena interrupted and voiced her concerns, left in protest with a large group of women flowing her out.

It was the first iron ore furnace in Alabama, preceding an industry that would come to dominate the state's economy in the late 19th and early 20th century. History The furnace was built by Joseph Dilliard, the Dilliard family into which Joseph was born had experience running iron works. Beginning in Jamestown and later in Middleburg Virginia. Originally using wood coal fired furnaces forging arms, utensils, and farm necessities. Later as the colonies expanded and coal was discovered wood was replaced by coal and later Coke as the primary heating elements of the Iron Works across the south developed by the Dilliard Family, in Virginia, The Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and Alabama fed by coal mined from holdings in West Virginia and Alabama. Buff Warren, Dilliard's overseer operated the property in Franklin County around 1818 using initially slave labor, which was later compensated at the request of General Grant with a parcel being laid out in Gibson County, TN for 75 acres in the name of a Negro Woman named Sarah P Dillard and her infant child, Samuel, which was later confiscated by East Tn. puppet scalawags and carpetbaggers. See also: A cholera outbreak in 1820 killed Buff's foreman a free negro Ed Haslam, and several of the slaves who operated the furnace. All were given a proper Christian burial. The furnace and site were sold by Transfer of Title and purchased in November 1825 by Joseph's son John Henry (J.) Dilliard a native of LaGrange Tennessee, registered in Deed of Title James Joseph (Jeff) Dilliard, originally of Limestone County, AL, later Greeneood, MS, to Dr John Henry Dilliard, of Hardeman County, TN 11/15/1825, registered originally in the county seat of Decatur County AL, in Woodville. Upon the abolishment of Decatur County by the Alabama Legislature, as the main landowner Henry Benton Dilliard discovered upon survey dated 1818 that the size of the county did not meet Alabama Constitutional minimum square mile requirements for an independent county and petitioned that his Plantation be divided at the natural boundary between Jackson and Madison Counties allowing commerce and development in what would become New Madison and Scottsboro, both stops on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad later constructed. The original land deeds of Title remained in Jackson County county at the Court House in Scotsboro until shortly after April 11, 1862 when Federal Troops occupied Limestone County, AL. As a favor to Dr John Henry Dilliard, General Grant ordered original deed registries removed from courthouses in territories ravaged by lawless guerilla vigilantes, while using his home Resolute as headquarters in Berlin, TN. Dr John H Dilliard, a fierce Southerner loyal to the South yet overwhelmingly opposed to secession left numerous volumes of first hand diary entries of Grants time in Berlin and Grand Junction, referred to by affectionately by locals to this day as Little Greenwood, now known as \\"LaGrange, TN.\\"library of congress, Ulysses S Grant Memoirs Joseph's son John Anderson Dilliard Sr. was later killed by these same vigilantes better known in West Tennessee as Fielding's Army, a paid group of assassins from East Tennessee more interested in theft and murder of innocent civilians and wounded Union and Confederate soldiers alike to illegally acquire land and assets than rules of war or law and order.oral History of West Tennessee, Taped interviews with John Walley, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN. While caring his son, Captain John Anderson Dilliard Jr. whom was wounded fighting for the South at Shiloh, John Anderson Dilliard Sr. was suddenly removed from his home in the middle of the night by Fielding Hurst, strung up in the front yard while the women and children were forced to watch, in an attempt to torture the Dilliard until he revealed where the families gold and silver had been buried. After refusing to do so he was taken by the guerillas and later murdered outside Fort Smith, Arkansas.letter received by Dilliard Family via Andrew Johnson Administration informing death of John Anderson Dilliard after \\"falling from his horse.\\" The Scoundrel guerrillas in West Tennessee during the Civil War had nothing in common with the noble efforts of militias fighting the British during the American Revolution. John Henry Dilliard (Jones) operated the iron works implemented many improvements to the process, and the furnace became a commercial success producing high quality product. The furnace operated until around 1859 to 1863, possibly due to a flood on the creek that reached the furnace and extinguished it, hardening the metal and rendering the furnace inoperable. More likely according to family oral history was the Furnace was ordered shut down by John H Dilliard in a word of honor agreement between General Grant and Dilliard in return for not burning his main Plantation Home Resolute, which was later burned by Union deserters from Ohio, and safely transferring documents to federal safety. Woodlawn the Home of John Anderson and Sarah Nutt Dilliard of Natchez is now referred to as the Michie home, and was General Sherman's West TN Headquarters, while Grant used Woodlawn while planning Garrison's Raid then transferred his West TN Headquarters to Resolute while planning the operation to take Memphis TN.library of congress, Ulysses S Grant Memoirs Resolute was located 3 ¬Ω miles to the south east of Grand Junction at the end of a .2 mile White Post Oak and Eastern Red Cedar lined alley running north from the main east west state line road running parallel to the old Memphis and Charleston Railroad bed, now Hwy 72. Before the furnace was constructed, most local blacksmiths used imported iron. The furnace's pig iron was used by locals and also transported to the Tennessee River at Middleburg Landing, later renamed Pittsburg Landing, then shipped east to Cuba Landing in Waverly, TN and shipped to New Orleans, Mobile, and Biloxi then overseas to London, England, Paris, France; and as far away as St Petersburg Russia. Erected 1815 by Joseph Dilliard who used the iron to make utensils for early settlers. Iron was from surface Hematite ore smelted by charcoal fires.http://www.lat34north.com/historicmarkersal/MarkerDetail.cfm?KeyID=30-01&MarkerTitle;=Cedar%20Creek%20Furnace Site The furnace was situated in a bend of Cedar Creek, from which it gets its name. The furnace was 15 feet (4.5 meters) high, 25‚Äì30 feet (7.5‚Äì9 m) in diameter at the base tapering to an 8 feet (2.5 m) diameter chimney at the top. It was built of limestone quarried nearby and lined with refractory brick made on site. It was fired with charcoal made from the surrounding forests. A bellows which supplied the furnace with air was powered by a 12-foot (3.5-m) wide mill race which was diverted from the creek. The mill race also powered a forge hammer, grist mill, and saw mill. A warehouse was built on the river bank, only the foundation of which remains. The overseer's house was located northeast of the furnace. A small cemetery near the site contains about a dozen graves, mostly unmarked.

W. Norton & Company on March 31, 2014. The book is a non-fiction investigation into the phenomenon of high-frequency trading (HFT) in the US financial market, with the author interviewing and collecting the experiences of several individuals working on Wall Street. Lewis concludes that HFT is used as a method to front run orders placed by investors. He goes further to suggest that broad technological changes and unethical trading practices have transformed the U.S. stock market from \\"the world's most public, most democratic, financial market\\" into a \\"rigged\\" market. Synopsis Flash Boys maintains a primary focus on Brad Katsuyama and other central figures in the genesis and early days of IEX, the Investors' Exchange. Sergey Aleynikov, a former programmer for Goldman Sachs, serves as a secondary focus. The introduction begins by naming Aleynikov and describing his arrest, along with the author's personal history on Wall Street, as the impetus for writing the book. The first chapter tells the story of a $300 million project from Spread Networks that was underway in mid-2009‚Äîthe construction of an fiber-optic cable that cuts straight through mountains and rivers from Chicago to New Jersey‚Äîwith the sole goal of reducing the transmission time for data from 17 to 13 milliseconds. (The construction of the line was dramatized years later in the film The Hummingbird Project.) Lewis goes on to describe the modern world of electronic trading and how it differs from the past, when trading was mostly performed in open outcry pits on physical trading floors, and how that change has impacted the market. The speed of data is a major theme in the book; the faster a market participant's computer system can receive and act on data, the better their edge, and opportunity to profit, with even nanoseconds making a difference. The central story details Katsuyama's discovery of how access to this fiber-optic cable, as well as other technologies and special arrangements between HFT firms, exchanges, and large Wall Street banks, presents an opportunity for those insider institutions to profit at the expense of retail investors. To counter this, Katsuyama bands together a team that sets out to develop a new exchange, called IEX, designed specifically to prevent the unfair advantage enjoyed by HFT firms in the rest of the market. The final chapter is dedicated to the tribulation of Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs programmer twice prosecuted and twice acquitted for a single act of allegedly copying proprietary computer source code from his employer before joining a competing firm. The epilogue details the author's bicycle journey to observe a string of microwave towers along the same stretch as Spread Networks' fiber-optic line. Lewis notes that to send a signal from Chicago to New York and back by microwave signal is about 4.5 milliseconds less than to send it inside an optical fiber, but when Spread Networks was laying its line, the conventional wisdom was that microwave transmission was too limited in the amount of data it could handle, and unreliable due to sensitivity to inclement weather. \\"But what if microwave technology improved?,\\" the author wondered. The story ends as the author climbs up a mountain summit where one of the towers is stationed. He notes the tower showed signs of age, and could have been erected some time ago, for some other purpose, but the ancillary equipment including a generator, a concrete bunker, and repeaters that amplify financial signals, were all new. Critical response The book has drawn criticism from some academics and industry experts, particularly on Lewis's grasp of HFT and other factual inaccuracies in its depiction of trading. Other critics have praised Lewis's explanations of trading concepts and concurred with his criticism of HFT; however, it is suggested that he neglects to pay attention to the larger issue of financial regulation, and had excessively simplified the relationship between various institutions in the financial market. A few executives in the industry have also responded by dismissing the book's content as \\"closer to fiction\\". Michael Lewis responded that everyone who said he \\"got it wrong\\" has a stake in the existing system. Manoj Narang, CEO of high-frequency trading firm Tradeworx, argued that Lewis' book is more \\"fiction than fact,\\" claiming Lewis needs a primer in HFT. A review by academic blogger Scott Locklin notes that Lewis had never spoken to, nor cited, a single high-frequency trader in the book. Andrew Ross, writing in The Guardian, praised the book as an \\"effective expos√©\\" but criticizes the author for arguing for the \\"heroism\\" of one group of financial insiders over another. A month later, an article in The Economist noted that Lewis's book had generated \\"vigorous criticism\\", but that there may be some merits in its liquidity concerns. A Financial Post reviewer suggested that Lewis intentionally omitted details that point to market- stabilizing benefits of HFT: \\"Ironically, the Flash Crash itself was just glossed over. Could that be because the primary cause of that momentary blip lay in a confluence of regulatory mistakes and that it was many of the demonized HFTs who actually stood fast throughout and thereby ensured that the damage was a fraction of what it could have been had only the shell-shocked, traditional participants been left to respond?\\" An Oxford University Press handbook chapter authored by Andreas Fleckner calls Flash Boys a readable and mostly accurate introduction into such topics as dark pools, front-running, or kickbacks. The article however suggests that on-site trading practices are, nonetheless, too technical for laymen, market observers, or even regulators to fully understand. The author recommends providing incentives for self- regulation rather than SEC regulation. Felix Salmon, a financial columnist for Slate Magazine, asserted that the negative impact of high-frequency trading is restricted to \\"very rich\\" financial intermediaries, such as hedge funds. He notes that Lewis's story \\"needs victims\\" and that he portrays several billionaire characters as victims \\"by pulling out every rhetorical device he can muster.\\" In a crucial part of the book's narrative, a mutual fund manager named Rich Gates was \\"shocked\\" to find out he was paying 0.04% per trade due to his fund's dependence on a HFT front. The reviewer noted that Gates' own mutual fund charged an average of 2.41% for \\"expenses\\" to retail investors. Impact and aftermath The book reached No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list, overtaking Capital in the Twenty-First Century, and remained on the top for three weeks. Jonathan Weil at Bloomberg suggests that the FBI's investigation into high frequency trading, a day after the book's release, was directly motivated by the book's claims. Lewis's phrase \\"The market is rigged\\" was often referenced. The chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mary Jo White, stated in Congressional testimony on April 29, 2014, that U.S. financial markets \\"are not rigged\\" in response to a direct question on claims in Lewis's book. Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg disputed claims made in Lewis' book on May 2, 2014, stating in a CNBC interview that \\"the system isn‚Äôt rigged.\\" Arthur Levitt, adviser to high- frequency firm KCG Holdings and former SEC chairman, commented that variation exists within the group of high-speed traders that Lewis‚Äô book describes, saying \\"What is missed in the book and in the general discussion of HFT is there are some HFT traders who respect the sanctity of the investor, and some who don‚Äôt.\\" On May 1, 2014, the New York Stock Exchange and two affiliated exchanges agreed to pay $4.5 million as a settlement for related investigations by the SEC. The SEC noted a number of procedural violations, an improper use of an error account, and operating a block trading platform that did not comply to NYSE/SEC rules. The NYSE also agreed to find an independent consultant to review its procedures and policies. This was the second-ever SEC financial penalty to be levied at a stock exchange; the first penalty was handed out in 2012. Some writers suggest that the release of popular works such as Flash Boys contributed to these decisions. The charges are unrelated to high-frequency trading. Film In April 2014, Sony Pictures acquired the film rights to the book. In June that year, it was announced that Flash Boys was to be adapted into a major motion picture, with acclaimed screenwriter/producer Aaron Sorkin penning the screenplay, and Scott Rudin and Eli Bush producing the film. The project would be a second collaboration between Sorkin and Rudin on a Lewis book adaptation, as the pair also filled the same respective roles on Moneyball. By September 2017, the project had not appeared to make any progress, seemingly stuck in development hell. Lewis commented his thoughts as to the stumbling block to a book-to-movie adaptation during a session at the National Book Festival in Washington, D.C. During a conversation with Washington Post journalist Joel Aschenbach, Lewis stated the trouble was Hollywood won't cast \\"a movie with an Asian lead.\\" (The real-life main character in Flash Boys, IEX founder Brad Katsuyama is of Asian heritage.) Lewis stated that private emails leaked in the 2014 Sony Pictures hack revealed studio apprehension with having an Asian lead actor, as well as with an Asian character portrayed by a White actor. In May 2018 it was announced that Sony Pictures' option for the screenplay had expired and film rights were acquired by Netflix. Ben Jacoby was named as the new screenwriter.

The building is considered to be one of the finest examples of antebellum architecture in North Carolina. The museum is dedicated to the history of Rowan County. Listed on the National Register of National Places in March 1970. The courthouse was built and completed by Conrad and Williams contractors between 1855‚Äì1857. The courthouse is a two-story building with a hexastyle colossal Doric portico along the front facade. A new courthouse was built in 1914 and is now located next door. The courthouse was transformed into the Community Building and now houses the Rowan Museum. Among the museum's holdings is the Old Stone House, a Georgian two-story structure built in 1766 near present-day Granite Quarry by Michael Braun, a wheelwright, printer and carpenter. The house is the oldest in Rowan County and one of the State's few remaining stone houses. Descendants or Braun and the Fisher family worked to preserve the house in the 1950s, when there was the possibility of it being torn down so its rock could be used for roads. The families donated the restored house to the museum in 1966. Other historic properties managed by the museum include the Utzman-Chambers House and the Josephus Hall House located in Salisbury and the China Grove Roller Mill in China Grove, NC. On the first floor are exhibits that display the history of Rowan County. The second floor of the museum features the Messinger Room which displays the remnants of a 19th-century courthouse. It is often rented for business and private events during the year. Throughout the year the museum hosts an Antique Show, Germafest, Spring Frolic, summer camps, and Old Stone Christmas.

It is the story of the final year in the life of Leo Tolstoy, told from multiple viewpoints, including Tolstoy's young secretary, Valentin Bulgakov, his wife, Sophia Tolstaya, his daughter Sasha, his publisher and close friend, Vladimir Chertkov, and his doctor, Dushan Makovitsky. The novel was an international best-seller, translated into more than thirty languages, and adapted into an Academy Award-nominated film of the same name (The Last Station). Plot Set in 1910, the novel tells the true story of Tolstoy's life in his last days, before he ran away from his wife and his family home, taking to the road, where he died in a small railway station called Astapovo, with only his doctor and his favourite daughter, Sasha, in attendance (the film of this novel add Valentin Bulgakov and others to the deathbed scene who were not, in fact, present). The various narrators, and others in the Tolstoy household and outside of it, were pulling at him, trying to get his attention. He was pulled in a thousand directions at once, and this wore him down. In particular, he found the entreaties of his wife, Sofya, difficult, as she suspected (correctly) that he was plotting with his closest friend, Chertkov, to betray the family by giving away the copyright to his works. Sofya's main concern was the family and the difficulty of maintaining her style of life after her husband's death (he was, after all, 82). A major subplot of the novel involves Tolstoy's young secretary, Valentin Bulgakov, who comes to work with his hero in 1910 and bears witness to the controversies and difficulties surrounding him. Bulgakov falls in love with Masha, a Tolstoyan, who lives at a nearby compound called Telyatink, where a group of ‚ÄúTolstoyans‚Äù have gathered to live communally and put into practice his ideas: chastity, vegetarianism, and nonviolent resistance to evil. Like Tolstoy, these were pacifists who opposed the Tsarist regime. The novel builds dramatically to a climax at the railway station at Astapovo, where Tolstoy thought he was dying alone, although a small army of reporters had gathered from around the world to report on the death of the famous author, who had the status of a saint or rock star in Russian society. His death was major news throughout the world. This novel mines the contradictions between Tolstoy's religious and political convictions, and those of his followers, and the luxurious life he found himself living ‚Äì having been born into the Russian aristocracy and inherited a major estate. Reception The Last Station had consistent praise from critics at home and abroad. On the front page of The New York Times Book Review, Miranda Seymour wrote: ‚ÄúThe Last Station one of those rare works of fiction that manages to demonstrate both scrupulous historical research and true originality of voice and perception. . . . What lifts this book high above most historical novels is Jay Parini‚Äôs remarkable ability to enter the minds of his characters.‚Äù Gore Vidal called the novel ‚ÄúOne of the best historical novels written in the past twenty years.‚Äù Writing in the Times Literary Supplement, John Bayley called this novel ‚Äúa subtle masterpiece‚Äù and suggested that ‚ÄúTolstoy himself would probably have recognized the work of a true artist.‚Äù Reviewers consistently praised the lyrical quality of the writing. The Sunday Times of London said: ‚ÄúJay Parini has written a stylish, beautifully paced and utterly beguiling novel.‚Äù Adaptations The novel was made into an Academy Award-nominated film (also The Last Station) that was released in 2009, directed by Michael Hoffman and starring Helen Mirren, Christopher Plummer, Paul Giamatti, and James McAvoy. The Last Station was adapted in 1999 for the stage by Blake Robison and Connan Morrissey.

In 1958, Suriname Aluminum Company LLC (), a subsidiary of Alcoa, gained an agreement with the Suriname government to build the dam to power an aluminium smelter. Construction began in 1961 and it was completed in 1964. About 75% of power generated is used for processing aluminum, the rest is used in Paramaribo downstream. The power station was operational in 1965 but the very large reservoir, Brokopondo Reservoir, was not completely filled until 1971. Greenhouse gases emitted from the reservoir resulted in poor water quality for decades. Highly acidic water also damaged the power station's turbines.

The club was an autonomous offshoot of the church and the members organised instruction in art and history as well as presenting music and presentations by leading intellectuals. Some believe that the club was spurred into self education because middle class educated women were arriving in Chilean society highlighting how-ill informed privileged women were. Perez defended different types of feminism, feminism that \\"awakens in the woman the right to study... the right to draw on all the skills that make an effective culture and also the right to establish personality, a feminism that is almost equivalent to the simple and important concept of being, because who is not perceived individually different between the human community has no right to be\\". in 1917 the club's lobbying led to the first realisation of women's civil rights in Chile.

Pat is also one of three storms in the Western Pacific which interacted with each other. Originating from a monsoon trough towards the end of August, Pat first formed on August 24 several hundred miles east of the Philippines. It gradually intensified, and two days later, Pat was upgraded into a tropical storm. The cyclone initially moved east-northeast while continuing to deepen. However, Pat leveled off in intensity on August 27\\\\. After turning northwest, Pat attained typhoon intensity on August 28\\\\. Pat accelerated towards the north, and reached its peak intensity of on August 30\\\\. The next day, the storm crossed the southern Japanese islands and entered the Sea of Japan. Gradually weakening, Pat transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later on August 31. Early the next day, the storm moved ashore along northeastern Japan. The system dissipated on September 2 after reentering the Pacific Ocean. A total of 23 perished due to Typhoon Pat and 12 others were rendered as missing. Additionally, 79 people were injured. Furthermore, 38 houses in Japan were demolished, 110 were damaged, and over 2,000 were flooded. More than 160,000 homes lost power. A total of 165 flights were cancelled. Meteorological history Typhoon Pat originated from an active monsoon trough located east of the Philippines in the last two weeks of August. Forming around the time as Typhoon Odessa and Tropical Storm Ruby, an area of enhanced convection was first noted towards the end of August. At 0600 UTC on August 24, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started watching the system. Fifteen hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed suit. At this time, the system was located within a favorable environment. The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the afternoon of August 25. Early the next day, the JMA upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Storm Pat. Later on August 26, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of and a pressure of , but did not locate a surface circulation. That afternoon, the TCFA was re-issued. Following additional Hurricane Hunter reports, which noted evidence of a surface circulation, the JTWC declared the system Tropical Storm Pat. Initially poorly organized, Pat headed east-northeast, south of a subtropical ridge. At 0600 UTC on August 27, the JMA increased the intensity of the storm to . Meanwhile, the JTWC anticipated the storm to move east-northeast and separate from the monsoon trough before turning west-northwest under a weakening ridge. Instead, Pat drifted northeast, but remained situated within the monsoon trough. As such, the JTWC revised their forecast, and now expected the storm to move northwest due to the presence of an eastward moving trough situated over Mongolia. Meanwhile, the JMA increased the intensity of Pat to early on August 28. Several hours later, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Pat to a typhoon. According to the JMA, the storm leveled off intensity for about a day. By midday on August 29, some tropical cyclone forecast models began to show Pat emerging into the Sea of Japan west of the ridge. However, this theory was not supported by the JTWC as they believed that the ridge was too narrow to be picked up a trough. That same day, the JTWC increased the intensity to , equivalent to a Category 2 cyclone on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The next day, the agency finally revised its forecast and predicted the storm to enter the sea. Around this time, the JTWC estimated that Pat attained peak intensity, with winds of . During the evening of August 30, the JMA reported that Pat reached its peak intensity of and a pressure of . By this time, the ridge was gone, though a trough was now located near South Korea. Shortly after its peak, Pat moved ashore along the southern tip Kyushu on August 31. Overland, Pat began to weaken, and early the next day, the JMA downgraded Pat to a severe tropical storm. Meanwhile, Pat began to interact with Odessa, as the systems were approximately apart. As Odessa moved east-northeast, Pat accelerated towards the north, and then emerged into the Sea of Japan later on August 31. That evening, the JTWC downgraded Pat into a tropical storm. At 2100 UTC that day, the JTWC noted that Pat had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. By this time, all the convection activity was restricted to the northeast quadrant of the system. Early on September 1, Pat made landfall in Hokkaido along northeastern Japan. At that time, the JMA estimated winds of . At midday, the JTWC stopped watching the system, although the JMA continued to do so until 1800 UTC on September 2. Preparations, impact and aftermath While crossing Japan, a peak rainfall total of was recorded in Ebino, including in a day. A peak hourly storm total of was measured at Gokaharadake on Nagasaki. Pat was responsible for strong winds, including a wind speed in Yakushima. The island of Kyushu sustained the worst affects from the typhoon. Twenty-three people were killed by the typhoon while 12 others were listed as missing. A 61-year- old man who died when knocked over by a street sign in Izumi. A 35-year-old woman was crushed to death in Kagoshima when her home was demolished. A total of 179 people were injured due to Pat, including 23 on Honshu and 156 on Kyushu. In Aomori, a tent fell on 400 people attending a sporting event, injuring 18\\\\. In the nearby Yamagata prefecture, a signboard at a school ground fell due to strong winds, injuring four students. Nearby, in the Kumamoto prefecture, one man was struck and killed by a flying tin plate, another was swept out to sea, and a man died when a ladder fell on him. Elsewhere, twelve fisherman perished at sea, seven of whom were not confirmed dead until September 2. A total of 38 houses in Japan were destroyed, 110 were damaged, and more than 2,000 were flooded. Landslides were observed at 56 locations. Power was lost to 160,000 families. A total of 165 flights were cancelled, delaying 15,000 passengers. A total of 160 trains were cancelled. Two bullet train lines experienced delays in Kyushu; ferry and air service were also delayed there. Offshore, ten fishing boats sunk, including one Japanese cargo ship. An additional 12 ships were rendered as missing. Ninety- five other boats took refuge in North Korea, though 59 left on September 2 to return to Japan.

Background Reginald John Hailstone was born at Woodstock on 1 November 1901, eldest son of Isaac Hailstone and his wife, Julia Finn. He was educated at home by his mother under a big peppercorn tree, which still stands at Green Gully, Mount McDonald. Hailstone's parents were pioneers in the area, settling in the Woodstock district in the 1890s. Civic positions and achievements Reg Hailstone was president of the Pastures Protection Board; a councilor and president of the Waugoola Shire Council; Chairman of the Wyangala National Park Trust; and actively involved in the Lachlan Valley Development League, as the representative of the Waugoola Shire Council. He was also a member of the Central Tablelands County and the Blayney Land Board. Hailstone was very enthusiastic about the development of the Lachlan Valley, contending that the area had \\"unlimited possibilities, as a producer of food stuffs\\". He also saw great potential in elevating Wyangala 'National Park' (now Wyangala Waters State Park) to be an important tourist destination for the region. Hailstone was instrumental in getting the government to form the Wyangala National Park Trust, which focused on the development and beautification of the area. Amongst his many civic achievements, Hailstone facilitated progress and development in the Lachlan Valley, bringing together opposing sides of politics for the benefit of the region. Politics Reg Hailstone was the nominated Country Party candidate for the 1953 New South Wales state election, electorate of Young. He was trying to unseat incumbent Labor Party member, Fred Cahill. Hailstone was the underdog in the election, being relatively unknown in the area at the time. Hailstone was defeated by Cahill by 2,716 votes, with Cahill receiving 10,802 votes versus 8,086 votes for Hailstone. This was his only foray into State politics. Death Reg Hailstone collapsed and died after going swimming at Manly in 1963. The road between Wyangala and Woodstock was named \\"Reg Hailstone Way\\" in his honour.

It serves more than 2,300 students in the School District.Education.com: School Finder http://www.education.com/schoolfinder/us/missouri/district/perry- county-32-school-district/ History The first public school classes were held in the old Methodist Church in the 1860s. The church was located on the corner of East North and North Spring Streets. The teacher was Patrick Monoghan. In 1867, the center part of the first public high school building was erected. This building, which consisted of 3 rooms, was located at the corner of Magnolia and West North Streets. In 1917, a new high school was built next to the existing building, which was then converted to a grade school. This building was used as the high school until 1938. The high school building located at College and Edwards Streets - now called the Old Senior High School - was completed in 1938, the same year that the Farm Engineer's Building located behind the Old Senior High (which now houses the maintenance department) was built. From 1960-1966, nineteen small school districts within Perry County are annexed into District 32. In 1975, voters approved a $1.25 million bond issue to build a new high school. The facilities opened in April 1976 and eliminated a number of trailers used as classrooms. The new high school housed English, social studies, math, science and special services rooms. Administrative offices, guidance offices, resource centers, a cafeteria and commons area are also included.Mshsaa.org https://www.mshsaa.org/Schools/AccountInfo.aspx?s=411 Perryville k-12 http://www.perryville.k12.mo.us/Page/2503State Historical Society of Missouri: Perry County http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/descriptions/desc-edu.html Schools =High schools= * Perryville High School (09-12) * Perryville Area Career & Technology Center (09-12) =Middle schools= * Perry County Middle School (05-08) =Elementary schools= * Perryville Early Childhood Special Education Center (PK) * Perryville Elementary School (K-04) References External links *Website Category:Schools in Perry County, Missouri Category:School districts in Missouri ","title":"Perry County 32 School District (Missouri)"},{"id":"42356362","text":"The Contractual Mistakes Act 1977 codifies and replaces into law the remedies for mistake previously available under common law.

The foundation is named after the town of Waubra, Victoria Australia, but is not linked to it in any other way. The town is home to the 128 turbine Waubra Wind Farm. Pseudo scientific claims Claims made by the Waubra Foundation relating to wind turbine syndrome and wind farm syndrome are considered pseudo scientific and are not recognised as actual diseases by any international disease classification system, nor do they appear in any title or abstract in the United States National Library of Medicine's PubMed database. Wind turbine syndrome has been characterized as pseudoscience. Since 2003, 25 reviews have been published of the scientific literature on wind turbines and health. These studies have consistently found no reason to believe that wind turbines are harmful to health.An abridged list of articles that demonstrates the pseudo scientific nature of the Waubra Foundation's claims:     History  The Foundation was originally known as the 'Waubra Disease Foundation' after claims that health problems reported by some residents of Waubra were caused by wind turbines. The Waubra Foundation has claimed that wind turbines have a mental and physical health impact on some people, largely as a result of infrasound. The Foundation claims the following symptoms are consistent with the impacts of wind turbine proximity: sleep disturbance, headache including migraines, tinnitus, ear pressure (often described as painful), balance problems / dizziness, vertigo, nausea, visual blurring, irritability, problems with concentration and memory, panic episodes, and tachycardia (fast heart rate). In 2009, the term Wind Turbine Syndrome was coined to encompass the broad range of symptoms described by complainants living near turbines. The Foundation has published reports from sufferers of wind turbine syndrome symptoms living as far as 17 kilometres from the nearest turbine. In November 2013, Senator Richard Di Natale, at that time health spokesperson for the Australian Greens, and former general practitioner, lodged a written complaint with both the Australian Charities and Not-for- profits Commission (ACNC) and the Australian Tax Office, questioning the Waubra Foundation's qualification as a health promotion charity, on the basis that the foundation‚Äôs claims are false and misleading, and that they might actually be causing harm. On 11 December 2014, the ACNC revoked the foundation‚Äôs registration as a health promotion charity, with the Assistant Commissioner saying, \\"It is not possible for me to find that the Foundation's principal activity promotes the prevention or control of disease in human beings\\". In December 2017, the decision was affirmed after a failed appeal.

Construction  The ferry was constructed in 1865 using the engine from an earlier ferry, the Boxer I, built by Alexander Lyle. Lyle, who had also built the two ferries preceding the Boxer, died in 1858. A man from New Glasgow named Mr. Cameron was hired in Lyle's place to build the new ferry in Dartmouth Nova Scotia. It was the last ferry to be built locally in Dartmouth until the Governor Cornwallis ferry in 1940.  Incidents  The Chebucto suffered a few minor damages over the years due to accidents, but nothing major enough to end its use. These accidents were mainly the Chebucto colliding with other boats or docks causing zero to mild damages. It has however, been used on multiple occasions to tow other damaged ferries to shore. One of the most notable incidents on the Chebucto, happened on June 29, 1875, when a man and his daughter were aboard the ferry on their horse and wagon heading to Halifax. Something caused the horses to panic which resulted in the daughter, horse, and wagon to fall overboard. The horse drowned despite trying to swim for a short time. The horse was pulled under the surface by the sinking wagon, as it was still attached to it. The daughter was rescued and survived. This unusual and tragic event led to the implication of stronger guard cables on ferries to prevent any more unfortunate accidents of similar nature.  Legacy  During the time the Chebucto was in use, it was mostly running alongside the Sir Charles Ogle, and the Micmac, which were two other ferries in the Halifax Harbour. Despite a delayed completion, disappointing first launch, and other incidents, the Chebucto served as one of the links between the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth for 27 years. It was finally sold in 1892 for only $275. In 1906, 14 years after the sale of the Chebucto, a new ferry with the same name was built to use in the harbour between Halifax and Dartmouth. . These ferries are also known as Chebucto I and Chebucto II, respectively.

After World War II, the reigning paradigm of product-oriented mass production had reached its peak. Examples of management systems at that time are linear assembly lines, organizational hierarchies of command, product quality control and mass consumption. Soon afterwards, the Deming-Juran process-quality teachings spearheaded a new quality orientation (later referred to as Total quality management) and propelled Japan directly to the post-war process focus (process quality control, just-in-time, continuous improvement). The US responded by a painful and prolonged product-to-process transformation, ultimately leveling the playing field again by the mid 1980s. At the end of the 1980s, business process reengineering focused on the radical redesign of the production process through the reintegration of task, labor and knowledge. As a result, lean, flexible and streamlined production processes were created, capable of fast response and internet-based integration necessary for the upcoming phase of supply chains - business-to- business (B2B) ‚Äì as well as demand chains ‚Äì business-to-customer (B2C). In the above three stages of Evolution of Management Systems, the competitive advantage was derived almost exclusively from the internal resources of the firm. At the end of the 1980s, a radical fourth shift has occurred: the competitive advantage became increasingly derived from the external resources of the firm ‚Äì through the extended networks of suppliers and customers. 533x533px Figure 1 refers to the basic scheme of production and service delivery process. It represents the traditional linear input-process-output management system. This system has been fixed and unchanging for centuries. The only change has been in terms of changing focus on individual components of the system, emphasizing different parts of this basic scheme. Although the scheme itself (inputs ‚Üí process ‚Üí outputs) remains mostly unchallenged, there are some indications that this business model will undergo major restructurings in the future (in the emerging stages of Evolution of Management Systems). It will become disaggregated and distributed, subjected to non-linear modularity and bringing forth new ways of making things and delivering services. Then it will become reintegrated again, tying together globally distributed components into a unified recycling whole.  Early stages  All early stages are characterized by changing focus of attention within the unchanging, invariant scheme of Figure 1. The management system has typically focused on: = Final product = The final product is a primary focus, the production process is considered secondary. Its operations and their sequences are technologically fixed or ‚Äògiven‚Äô. Product quality is ‚Äòinspected in‚Äô, mostly at the end of the process. Statistical quality control, inventory control, cost minimization, mass production, assembly line, work specialization, hierarchies of command, mass consumption, statistical mass markets and forecasting are among the defining characteristics of this stage. = Partitioned process = It is the high-quality process that assures the high-quality product. The main focus was on improving of process operations. Quality of the process was understood as the quality of its operations. Powerful new concepts of Total Quality Management (TQM), Continuous Improvement Process (Kaizen) and Just-In-Time (JIT) systems have characterized this stage. Although the operations were being improved, the process architecture and structural sequencing were kept intact and remained technologically ‚Äògiven‚Äô. = Integrated process = The focus of attention shifted from operations (circles) to linkages (arrows) ‚Äì thus changing the process architecture itself. The reengineering of the process, re-integrating individual components into effective, more autonomous and even self-manageable wholes, has characterized this stage. The production process became a business process and therefore subject to qualitative redesign and reengineering (BPR). Discontinuous improvement and process innovation replaced the piecemeal continuous improvement. Traditional vertical hierarchies of command have flattened out into more horizontal, process-oriented networks. Mass customization, disintermediation, knowledge management and autonomous teams have started emerging.  Extended process  463x463px Figure 2 refers to the paradigmatic shift from internal processes expanded into the extended process ‚Äì including supplier networks and alliances as well as customer self-service, mass customization and disintermediation ‚Äì as the increasingly external sources of competitive advantage. In this recently peaked stage, networks of suppliers and communities of customers have extended the internal process into a functional and competitive whole. Both internal and external sources of knowledge and competitiveness have formed new core competencies. Supply and demand chains management have emerged, in dependence on shifting CIP (Customer Intervention Point). Intranets and extranets have provided a communication medium for B2B and B2C exchanges. Quality has become bundled together with cost, speed and reliability.. Today, powerful processes of global sourcing bring forth and foster a new set of relationships with customers and suppliers. The firm starts disaggregating its production processes, transferring, leasing or selling selected pieces off to a higher-added value operator or coordinator. Any firm can be only as good as is the network of which it is a part. Consequently, the firm has disaggregated and became a network.  Distributed process  This emerging stage represents the most radical business refocusing so far. Through the global sourcing, sections and components of the internal process are being outsourced to external providers and contractors in search of the highest added value contribution. Long-term alliances are formed and companies are transforming themselves into networks. Network cooperation is replacing corporate competition: coopetition emerges. The majority of companies (also the educational and training institutions) could still be the leading global players in this incessant and accelerating paradigm shifting. Globally distributed process ushers in new forms of organization, coordination and modular integration. 466x466px Different parts of the extended process are geographically distributed and often spatially remote. In Figure 3, this distribution is represented by sections OS of the process which have been outsourced to higher added-value providers. Although the Stage 5 (Figure 3) represents the most radical business refocusing emerging so far, still rapidly emerging kernels of the next stage (Figure 4) is taking shape. The evolutionary process, driven by relentless global search for maximum added value, is clearly accelerating. Management systems paradigm or business model, after a century of relative invariance, is becoming a new dynamic source of competitive advantage. Radically distributed supply and demand chains of Stage 5 will clearly have to be coordinated and reintegrated on a global scale. Reintegration processes are proceeding under increasing environmental pressures. The search for added value, after exploring traditional global resources, is now turning towards reuse, recycling, recovery and remanufacturing as new sources of maximizing added value. Innovation in business models will become a norm.  Recycled process  465x465px During the process of utilizing added value, the asset-recovery practices expand quickly to a majority of products and services (Dell, IBM, Xerox). New products are being designed for extended life spans and multiple profit cycles. Reverse logistics and reverse logistics management (RLM) are adding new loops to the traditionally unidirectional processes of supply chains. Old supply chains have become demand chains and now reverse value chains, demonstrating that value can be added in both directions: through the forward pass of production as well as through the backward pass of recovery and remanufacture. Concepts of easy disassembly, durability, reuse and recycling are built in into equipment design. Figure 4 refers to closed-loop management system and it represents the Stage 6 of the Evolution of Management Systems. The new loops in the figure are not just traditional information feedback loops, but real business processes of collection, disassembly, reprocessing and reassembly activities (operations). The conventional open- ended linear processes are being redesigned towards closure. New loops of recycled products and materials, energy recovery and knowledge renewal are being created within global-sourcing (GS) networks. Product reuse/remanufacture relies on a high residual value which gives a good head start for added value maximization. The system becomes organizationally closed and potentially long-term sustainable or even trans-generations self- sustainable. The \\"openness\\" and customization of the product design, upgradeable products, flexible product platforms, mutability and waste-free strategies are being implemented. However, in this latest stage, new employee skills and managerial knowledge, as well as essential mass customization mindset are yet to be produced, maintained and renewed. Eliminating non-value added resources is still necessary. Integrating production system elements and work functions still needs time to evolve.  Evolutionary spiral  368x368px Evolutionary spiral of the six management systems (SMS) are indicated in Figure 5. It is appropriate to notice that six-management-system evolution is progressing in an accelerated fashion, the periods of stasis are getting shorter and revolutions are occurring faster. Individual management systems are beginning to overlap and their boundaries are getting blurred. An era of continuous change in business models and management systems emerges: the search for competitive advantage (one over the other) becomes relentless, strenuous and resources depleting. Cooperation networks have to merge into larger entities, reducing competition and expanding collaboration. The search for collaborative advantage (for both jointly) will become the new mode of economic behavior.

History Jamie Daruwala first saw Alex Tittel playing with a fusion/rock/jazz instrumental band, Wasted Potential, while attending a keg party at Rice University in late 1987. Two songs caught Jamie's attention, and they both happened to be based on Alex's riffs. ‚ÄúHe was everything I always wanted in a guitar player, and our guitar sounds meshed really well, so I was able to start focusing on singing and writing‚Äù, said Jamie. The pair wrote their first song, ‚ÄúAwhile‚Äù from one of those riffs, and have been together ever since. In 1989 Jamie was graduating, and they decided to give the band a real shot. Billy West answered an ad for a bass player, and the original drummer was Jimmy Way followed soon after by Jason Wreck. They moved into and rehearsed in a Houston warehouse off of Washington Avenue where the phone number spelled out TOY-SUBS, and the band name was born. After their very first Houston Live date at Blythe Spirits on April 1, 1990, the band was spotted by a talent scout who invited them to perform on \\"Star Search\\". The band would accept, but there would be one more change. Darwin Keys (The Judy's, Pushmonkey, Ashbury Keys) left The Judy's to join Toy Subs on drums. Toy Subs were on six shows that aired in the spring of 1991, and made it to the semi-finals. This was followed by a number of appearances on local and regional radio, and coverage from publications such as the Houston Press, including several \\"Best Of\\" Awards Live, Toy Subs played over 1500 shows throughout the 90's in Texas, surrounding states, and Japan. The band played festivals like Buzz Fest (Houston, 1995 and 1997), and opened for Bush, the Smithereens, Big Wreck, Catherine Wheel, Steve Vai and Sammy Hagar and more. In the studio, Toy Subs consistently produced demos to shop to record labels. In 1990, they released a local cassette called ‚ÄúNow‚Äù based on their first demo, which also had some of the bed music they used on Star Search. Several follow-up demos recorded in 1990-92 were not released (until much later on ‚ÄúToy Subs Early Years: Demos and Bootlegs‚Äù) because of a production deal they had with Steve Ames of Rampart Studios. During that time, Billy West left and was replaced by Bill Walter on bass. After parting ways with Steve, the band followed up with a pair of demos recorded with engineer/producer Alan Doss (drummer for Galactic Cowboys on label DGC at the time) called ‚ÄúThe Red Floor Sessions‚Äù 1 and 2, the first of which was released locally on cassette in 1993. By 1994, Darwin and Bill were followed by Greg Mayfield on Bass and John Simmons on drums. They quickly recorded a four-song CD at Rivendell with Alan Doss and Ryan Birsinger called ‚ÄúShed‚Äù thinking that would be the new band name for original music. But, in 1995, the band brought in Brian Garcia as Producer/Manager and essentially a fifth member. They recorded a 7-song CD called ‚ÄúVim Fuego‚Äù under the name Shed only to be coaxed back to the name Toy Subs by the folks at The Buzz radio station in Houston due to the popularity of the name. Vim Fuego was repackaged with 8 songs, and produced three singles that achieved rotation status around Texas. The Buzz Houston broke ‚ÄúDr. Bre‚Äù, and the singles ‚ÄúW.I.D.L.Y.‚Äù and ‚ÄúSkydive‚Äù also received airplay at stations around Texas. Toy Subs continued to tour extensively, and recorded their follow-up, ‚ÄúVodka Sonic‚Äù, a ten-song CD that garnered airplay around TX as well. The singles receiving airplay were ‚ÄúBad Rain‚Äù, ‚ÄúApathy 101‚Äù, Take It Down‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSecret Sneak‚Äù, The band had small offers for publishing and record deals throughout the 90's, but turned them down in the hope of garnering a solid recording contract. It did not happen, and when the Buzz station sold to a major corporation, the airplay died with it. Toy Subs played the millennium New Year's show at Houston's Hard Rock Caf√©, and decided to stop touring and recording. After a hiatus with separate projects and Jamie's move out of Texas, the band reunited in 2009, reissued their original recordings digitally, and began composing new material. In 2010, Jamie, Alex, Darwin, and Bill Walter had the opportunity to work in the studio with Nirvana/Foo Fighters/Green Day producer Butch Vig They recorded a new version of ‚ÄúDr Bre‚Äù, and by 2013, Jamie moved back to Houston and began writing and recording with Alex and Alan again. The band has been playing with the lineup of Jamie, Alex, Greg Mayfield on bass, and Alan Doss on Drums, and released a four-song EP called ‚ÄúThe Second Scene‚Äù in late 2014.

Northwest Regional style architecture is an architectural style popular in the Pacific Northwest between 1935 and 1960. It is a regional variant of the International style. It is defined by the extensive use of unpainted wood in both interiors and exteriors. Other features of the style include integration of the building with its setting through asymmetrical floor plans, extensive use of glass extending to the floor, a low-pitched or flat roof of shingles with overhanging eaves, and a minimum of decoration. It is sometimes known as Northwest Modern. The style was developed by architects including Paul Thiry in Seattle and John Yeon in Oregon, and was used most often in residential buildings. Other proponents of the style included Paul Hayden Kirk, Pietro Belluschi, John Storrs, Van Evera Bailey, Herman Brookman, and Saul Zaik. Notable examples Some examples of Northwest Regional style include the Harry F. Wentz Studio on the Oregon coast, and the Museum of Contemporary Craft, John Yeon Speculative House, Aubrey R. Watzek House, Zion Lutheran Church, and Visitors Information Center in Portland. Seattle examples include the Northeast Branch Library by Thiry, and University Unitarian Church.

The valley looked pretty from the eminence on the hill, but no encampment was in sight on either side of the river. ... We came up to our boys & proceeded to the ford. We crossed safely, but No.1 got stuck, & I had to return with our two lead yoke to draw them up. Even with 5 yoke we could hardly stir the load, as, the ground being spongy, the wheels sunk in the sand. The distance in crossing is some 300 yards, as we follow up the middle ground some distance after crossing half way, part of which was bare.\\" :\\"We camped below where we came out & nearly opposite the entering of the ford on the margin of the river. ... Exactly opposite our camp is the Mountain (San Diego Mountain) of brownish hue, with dark green shrubbery distributed here and there.\\" In August 1862, during the American Civil War, Lt. Col.

Mr Christopher has previously been elected as a representative of the Virgin Islands Party, the National Democratic Party and as an independent. It has no elected representatives and may now be defunct. The party was launched on 29 March 2014. The inaugural executive committee of the party included former People's Patriotic Alliance (PPA) member, Natalio Wheatley (also known as Sowande Uhuru) as president; Elford Parsons, vice- president; Claudette Rymer, secretary; Julia Christopher, assistant secretary; Dennis Rhymer, treasurer; Lorie Rymer, public relations officer; Sunny Prince, sergeant-at-arms; and Glanville Penn, chaplain. Mr Christopher is the chairman and leader of the new party. The introduction of the party to the public included a blistering attack during on the former administration of the Virgin Islands Party, which is the party that a number of the PEP members formerly had ties to. Plans for the new political party were announced in the press in August 2013, although private discussions may have occurred much earlier. Apart from Mr Christopher, only Mr Wheatley and Mr Rymer had previously stood for political office (both unsuccessfully). In the press it was speculated that proposed candidates may include former elected VIP politicians Dancia Penn and Vernon Malone, but in the event that did not transpire. The party had announced that it intended to contest all 13 seats in the 2015 general election. Eventually the party only put 5 candidates forward, all of whom were handily defeated (including Mr Christopher, who had previously held his seat in the legislature for 20 years). In November 2016 Natalio Wheatley left the PEP to join the Virgin Islands Party, and the party fielded no candidates in the 2019 British Virgin Islands general election.

This modernization, carried out gradually from 1936 onwards, allowed to increase the maximum elevation of the guns from 26 to 40-45 degrees and thus to increase the range from 6 to 11 km.–ö—ä–ª–Ω—ä–∫–æ–≤, –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞, –û—Ä—ä–∂–∏–µ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—è –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥ –ø—Ä–µ–∑ –≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–µ—Ç–µ, –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è , 1984, —Å—Ç—Ä. 233//Kylnykov, Nikola, The Weapons of the Bulgarian People through the Centuries, Voenno Izdatelstvo, Sofia, 1984, pp. 233–¶–≤–µ—Ç–∫–æ–≤, –í–µ—Å–µ–ª–∏–Ω, –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ –¥–µ–ª–æ –≤ –ø–µ—Ö–æ—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ –∏ –∞—Ä—Ç–∏–ª–µ—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –∞—Ä–º–∏—è 1878-1944, –ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ –Ω–∞ –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ –Ω–∞ –æ—Ç–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∞—Ç–∞, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1994, —Å—Ç—Ä. 116//Tzvetkov, Veselin, The Military R&D; Activities in the infantry and the artillery of the Bulgarian Army 1878-1944, Izdatelstvo na Ministerstvo na otbranata, Sofia, 1994, p. 116. Initially this modernization created problems with the Equilibrators and the Recoil mechanisms - the absorbers and the recuperators. As these were not replaced in the initial modernized carriages and were estimated for lower degrees, when gun elevation was used at 40-45 degrees with the new carriage, the recoil needed to be finalized by hand. The Equilibrators problem was fixed by the Artillery Engineer Captain Ivan Stefanov along with the artillery technician Chushkov in 1936, but the Recoil mechanisms was finally fixed after trials only in 1942-1943 by a group of artillery engineers (captain Petar Ivanov and Captain Ivan Kisyov) led by Ivan Stefanov.–°—Ç–µ—Ñ–∞–Ω–æ–≤, –ò–≤–∞–Ω, –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏ –Ω–∞ –∞—Ä—Ç–∏–ª–µ—Ä–∏–π—Å–∫–∏—è –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä - –í—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ —á–∞—Å—Ç, –≤: –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫, 6/1996, —Å—Ç—Ä. 118, 131-132//Stefanov, Ivan, Memoirs of the artillery engineer - Second part, in: Military History Collection, Vol. 6/1996, pp. 118, 131-132, ISSN 0204-4080 # Converting to towed carriage for motor traction - in 1936 a group of artillery technicians led by Lazar Velitchkov developed special towed carriages for towing 75mm guns with speeds to up to 40 km/h by the then available trucks \\"Steyr\\" and \\"Morris Commercial\\" –¶–≤–µ—Ç–∫–æ–≤, –í–µ—Å–µ–ª–∏–Ω, –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ –¥–µ–ª–æ –≤ –ø–µ—Ö–æ—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ –∏ –∞—Ä—Ç–∏–ª–µ—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –∞—Ä–º–∏—è 1878-1944, –ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ –Ω–∞ –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ –Ω–∞ –æ—Ç–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∞—Ç–∞, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1994, —Å—Ç—Ä. 123//Tzvetkov, Veselin, The Military R&D; Activities in the infantry and the artillery of the Bulgarian Army 1878-1944, Izdatelstvo na Ministerstvo na otbranata, Sofia, 1994, p. 123 # Replacing the worn gun barrels - in 1936-1937 the Artillery Engineer Captain Ivan Stefanov developed a project for the replacement of the barrels of the 75mm field guns, which were in bad condition.

Biography =Career= He worked as a Professor of Historical and Pastoral Theology at the McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago.Minutes of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, Presbyterian Board of Publication, 1873, p. 578 Paul H. Bergeron (ed.), The Papers of Andrew Johnson: September 1865-January 1866, Knoxville, Tennessee: University of Tennessee Press, 1991, p. 133 Although he was living in Chicago during the American Civil War of 1861-1865, he was directly affected by the war through his direct family. Indeed, in a letter addressed to Andrew Johnson (1808-1875), who served as the 17th President of the United States from 1865 to 1869, sent on September 26, 1865, Presbyterian minister David Xavier Junkin (1808-1880) explained that Leroy's brother, Henry F. Halsey (1815-1887), had been ruined by Union troops, who took over his factory in Alabama. As a result, Leroy was the only one left to support his brother's family in the vanquished South. Junkin asked Johnson to have the factory returned to Henry Halsey, making it possible for him to earn his livelihood again. He is credited for first coining the sobriquet \\"Athens of the South\\" to refer to Nashville.Christine M. Kreyling, Wesley Paine, Charles W. Warterfield, Susan Ford Wiltshire, Classical Nashville: Athens of the South, Nashville, Tennessee: Vanderbilt University Press, 1996, p. xiii The phrase was later promoted by Reverend Philip Lindsley (1786‚Äì1855), a Presbyterian minister who founded the University of Nashville. He went on to edit a volume of Lindsley's publications. Additionally, he wrote a memoir about Reverend Lewis W. Green (1806-1863), another Presbyterian minister who served as the President of Hampden-Sydney College from 1849 to 1856, of Transylvania University from 1856 to 1857, and of Centre College from 1857 to 1863.John D.

Life The son of Thomas and Ann Noake, he was born at Sherborne, Dorset on 29 November 1816. He came to Worcester in 1838 to work on Berrow's Worcester Journal and lived in the city for the rest of his life. Noake later worked on the Worcestershire Chronicle, and his last appointment was as sub-editor of the Worcester Herald. Around 1874 he concentrated on local affairs. He was in turn sheriff (1878), mayor and alderman (1879), and magistrate (1882) for Worcester; as mayor he reopened the old Guildhall, which had been restored and enlarged. For many years he was one of the honorary secretaries of the Worcester Diocesan Architectural and Arch√¶ological Society. Noake died at Worcester on 12 September 1894 and was buried at the cemetery in Astwood Road on 15 September. Works All Noake's works related to Worcestershire. He found documents in a chest in the tower of St. Swithin's Church, Worcester that shed light on the history of the city. He published: * The Rambler in Worcestershire; or Stray Notes on Churches and Congregations, 1848; similar volumes in 1851 and 1854. * Worcester in Olden Times, 1849. * Notes and Queries for Worcestershire, 1856. * Monastery and Cathedral of Worcester, 1866.  Guide to Worcestershire, 1868. * Worcestershire Relics, 1877. * Worcestershire Nuggets, 1889. Noake also contributed to the Transactions of the Worcester Architectural and Arch√¶ological Society, and of the Associated Architectural Societies. Family Noake married, first, Miss Woodyatt of Ashperton, Herefordshire, by whom he had a son Charles, and a daughter who became Mrs. Badham; secondly, Miss Brown of Shrewsbury; thirdly, in 1873, Mrs. Stephens (died 1893), widow of a Worcester merchant.

He also made portraits, landscapes, wildlife, interiors and other works of art. Salem Harbor was Benson's first etching, made while he was at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, BostonPeabody Essex Museum, Interactive Presentation, Benson Timeline. and published in the school's magazine \\"Students in the School of Drawing\\". Benson was one of the editors of the magazine. Thirty years later, in 1912, Benson began etching again, a practice that thereafter became a major body of his work.Benson, Paff (1917), 28 Two plates were made of The Anchorage that depicted a fisherman bringing a dory to shore. The first resulted in 48 proofs on shogun paper, 43 of which were signed. The second plate was more spacious than the first and resulted in 25 signed proofs printed on shogun paper. The work was exhibited in 1915 and 1916 four times.Benson, Paff (1919), 89. Casting for Salmon is one of Benson's 359 etchings, most of which were made of waterfowl. In the simple composition of a fisherman reflected influence by Japanese artists and demonstrated his skill as an etcher. Benson declared Calm Morning of his three oldest children his \\"best out of door work.\\" In this case Benson was deliberate in his approach, he made three oil studies before making the final painting; Generally he started and finished he outdoor paintings on one canvas. From left to right, Eleanor, Elisabeth and George fished over the side of a boat off in the waters of their summer home in Maine. Benson was masterful in capturing the reflection of the boat on the water and the deeper color of its shadow. The vivid, luminous colors give depict the sun shining upon the children.Calm Morning, Boston Museum of Art. Over Benson's career he painted more than 600 watercolors, like Camp (or Salmon Fishing) that he made during a salmon fishing trip in Canada with his son, George.

She was the mother of Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, the last King of Travancore. Sethu Parvathi Bayi was distantly related by birth to the royal house of Travancore in the direct female line. In 1900, following the absence of heirs in the Travancore Royal Family she, along with her elder maternal cousin Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, was adopted by her maternal great-aunt, Senior Maharani Lakshmi Bayi. At the age of five, she became the Junior Maharani of Travancore. Sethu Parvathi Bayi chose Sri Pooram Nal Ravi Varma Thampuran of the Kilimanoor Palace as her consort owing to his high educational achievements. Their wedding took place in 1907. In 1912, after giving birth to the Heir-Apparent Sree Chithira Thirunal at the age of fifteen, she became the Amma (mother) Maharani (queen), or the Queen Mother of Travancore. Sethu Parvathi Bayi was an accomplished veena (stringed instrument) player, and a famous promoter of Carnatic Music and other arts. She played a major role in bringing to light the compositions of her ancestor Maharajah Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma of Travancore. She and cousin Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, were the grand daughters of renowned Indian artist, Raja Ravi Varma. Birth and adoption Sethu Parvathi Bayi was born on 7 November 1896 the daughter of Thiruvathira Nal Bhageerathi Bayi Uma Kochukunji Amma Thampuratty of the Utsavamadom branch of the Mavelikkara Royal House and Sri Thiruvonam Nal Kerala Varma Thampuran of Paliyakkara Eastern Palace. She had four brothers and three sisters. Two of her sisters, Srimathi Avittam Nal Bhawani Amma Thampuratty (artist and illustrator) and Srimathi Makayiram Nal Rajamma Amma Thampuratty (landscape artist under the name Amma Thampuran) were artists. Sethu Parvathi Bayi's grandmother belonged to the Kolathunad royal house in Travancore. Srimathi Makayiram Nal Rajamma Amma Thampuratty's grand daughter, Lekha Varma, was also adopted into the Travancore Royal house in 1996. Sethu Parvathy Bayi was also the younger grand daughter of the world- renowned artist Sri Raja Ravi Varma of the Kilimanoor Palace. The Mavelikkara royal house was closely associated with the Travancore Royal Family as her great-aunts, the then Senior and Junior Queens of Travancore, had been adopted and installed into the Royal Family of Travancore in 1858. This adoption, which was the sixth in the Travancore Royal House, was without results as the Senior Queen Lakshmi Bayi, who was married to Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran, was childless while the Junior Queen Parvathi Bayi had only sons. As the Travancore Royal Family follows matrilineal inheritance, the presence of females to continue the line and dynasty is crucial. With the death of the Junior Queen and her sons between 1893 and 1895, the royal family came to consist solely of Maharajah Moolam Thirunal, Senior Queen Lakshmi Bayi, and her two nephews. The Senior Queen decided to adopt the daughters of her nieces, Mahaprabha and Kochukunji of Mavelikara Utsavamadhom Palace, into the Travancore Royal Family. In 1900, Maharani Lakshmi Bayi petitioned Maharajah Moolam Thirunal for the adoption of her grand nieces, to perpetuate the ruling line. Thus, she became Princess Moolam Thirunal Sethu Parvathi Bayi, the First Princess of Travancore. The adoption itself was met with some opposition from other branches of the Kolathunad family who nominated females from their families. There were also objections from the First Prince Chathayam Thirunal Rama Varma, but these were overcome due to the insistence of the Senior Queen of Travancore. But after a year the Senior Queen Lakshmi Bayi died in 1901 and five-year-old Sethu Parvathi Bayi was elevated to the position of H. H. Sree Padmanbhasevini Maharani Moolam Thirunal Sethu Parvathi Bayi, Junior Maharani of Attingal. Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran, consort of the late Senior Maharani (Queen) Lakshmi Bayi, was appointed the guardian of the two minor Queens and tutors were appointed to teach them. Personal life Sri Ravi Varma Koyi Thampuran - The consort of Moolam Thirunal Sethu Parvathi Bayi At the age of ten, according to the prevalent tradition, alliances were sought for Sethu Parvathi Bayi's marriage. A select group of young men of high accomplishments were presented to her. She chose the twenty-one-year-old graduate, and Sanskrit scholar, Sri Pooram Nal Ravi Varma Thampuran of the Kilimanoor royal house, after being impressed by his erudition and his high level of education (college graduates were a rarity in those days). Their wedding took place in 1907; when she turned fourteen in 1911, their marriage was consummated. In 1912 she gave birth to her eldest son, the then Crown Prince, Sree Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, the last ruling Maharajah (King) of Travancore. Thus she became the Queen Mother at the age of fifteen. Sethu Parvathi Bayi gave birth to three more children. Her second child, a baby girl, was stillborn. Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi born in 1916 and Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma in 1922 are her other children. Contributions Sethu Parvathi Bayi was very interested in Carnatic Music and started learning music and the veena at a young age. According to musicologists and researchers, she made memorable contributions to Carnatic Music by organizing different music festivals, revamping Swathi Thirunal compositions, and promoting musicians like Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, and Muthiah Bhagavathar among others. She also made great efforts to bring compositions by Maharajah Swathi Thirunal back into prominence. She gave the task of revamping Swathi compositions to Muthiah Bhagavathar and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer assisted him with this task. Sethu Parvathi Bayi's eldest son, the then Maharajah of Travancore, Sree Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, established the Swathi Thirunal College of Music in 1939, and Muthiah Bhagavathar became its first principal. The task was continued by legendary musician, Sri Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. It was due to Sethu Parvathi Bayi's efforts that the Navarathri Music Festival became a huge event after the 1930s. Previously only Mullamudu Bhagavathars were allowed to sing at the festival. She invited the likes of Muthiah Bhagavathar, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, M. D. Ramanathan and others to sing there. T. Lakshmana Pillai in his treatise Music And The Royal House Of Travancore says the following about Sethu Parvathi Bayi : > I cannot close this brief narrative about ‚Äú Music and the Royal House‚Äù , > without making specific mention of Her Highness the present Junior Maharani > whose knowledge of the theory and practice of music is simply astonishing. > No one who has had the good fortune of listening to her conversation about > music can fail to be struck with Her Highness high, keen and refined > intelligence, her profundity of knowledge and the vast fund of her > information on the subject of music. As a player on the Veena, Her Highness > takes rank with the best artists in the field. Allegations and controversies According to Lakshmi Raghunandan's book on her grandmother Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, the birth of her eldest son, Sree Chithira Thirunal, changed Sethu Parvathi Bayi's position within the royal family as well as in Travancore as she became the Amma Maharani (Queen Mother) of Travancore at the age of fifteen. Raghunandan alleged that the constant hateful comments made by Kochukunji Thampuratty (Sethu Parvathi Bayi's mother) to her daughter led to the estrangement between the former and her elder cousin, Sethu Lakshmi Bayi. Raghunandan also alleges that Sethu Parvathi Bayi resented the fact that, Sethu Lakshmi Bayi and not herself, was chosen as the Regent for her minor son, Sree Chithira Thirunal who became the King (Maharajah) after the death of Sree Moolam Thirunal in 1924. Rama Varma Valiya Koyi Thampuran, the consort of Regent Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, prevented his wife from handing over the control of the financial allowance of the then Sree Chithira Thirunal to his mother Sethu Parvathi Bayi. There were also rumours of an assassination attempt on the young Maharajah Chithira Thirunal, allegedly at the behest of Rama Varma Valiya Koyi Thampuran, the consort of Sethu Lakshmi Bayi. All of these incidents further fanned the enmity between the two Queens. The heirs of Sethu Parvathi Bayi, and her other descendants have never commented on the allegations by Sethu Lakshmi Bayi's family, so their side of events remains unknown. Sethu Parvathi Bayi is known to have visited the Sabarimala temple, which is known for refusing entry to women of menstruating age. Decades after her death, the Kowdiar palace clarified that she entered the temple after the forbidden age, at 53 years. However, her recorded entry to the temple was at 1940, when she would have been only 44 years of age.

He also made portraits, waterscapes, landscapes, interiors and other works of art. Benson, an avid birdwatcher and hunter from a young age, spent nearly every non-winter weekend hunting or fishing.Bedford, 17. He initially became interested in painting to capture the wildlife he enjoyed, particularly birds.Bedford, 8. Benson's interest in painting initially grew out of his desire to be an ornithological illustrator. As a teenager, he spent the spring, summer and fall outdoors nearly every weekend bird watching, hunting or fishing.Bedford, 8. In 1892 Benson bought a hunting shack on Cape Cod with his brothers-in-law, Edward Peirson and Maurice Richardson. Swan Flight, exhibited at the St. Botolph Club in 1893, was Benson's first known exhibition of wildfowl.Bedford, 263. Entering the turn of the century wildfowl was not a marketable subject, but once he began creating and exhibiting his works the wildfowl paintings always sold.Bedford, 26. Benson, a sportsman at heart, had a solid body of work of wildlife scenes and birds, generally waterfowl. His works included oil paintings, watercolors, etchings and drypoint. Benson made Swan Flight, a group of wild swans in formation against a gray sky from the Cape Cod hunting cabin off of Nauset that he bought with his brothers-in-law. It was the first work he exhibited of wildfowl, a subject matter that Benson explored over the years of his artistic career. The painting was sold soon after it was completed, a dynamic that continued throughout his career. To a New York dealer, Benson once expressed: \\"I made a [painting of a wildfowl] the other day at home and I looked forward to exhibiting it and, almost before it was dry, a visitor saw it and carried it off! It‚Äôs my good fortune to be doing what people like, but it keeps me on the jump.\\" 4 Early Morning\\" is the culmination of Benson's appreciation of birds and Japanese composition, which was popular both in Boston and Paris. The silhouetted images of the birds flying over water is similar to the Japanese screen by Maruyama ≈åkyo \\"Geese Flying over a Beach\\". One of Benson's early interests was depiction of the bird life near Salem; His first oil paintings are still lifes of birds.

After conducting studies in the Hochschule f√ºr Musik of Cologne, he went on to study conducting in Vienna with Hans Swarowsky and in Paris with Nadia Boulanger. He also studied the piano with Alfons Kontarsky. Early career He began his career in Germany in theatres such as Aachen and Gelsenkirchen and in the late 70s met Gian Carlo Menotti while conducting ‚ÄúThe Consul‚Äù at the Athens Opera House. This led to an invitation to the Spoleto Festival in 1976 to conduct some performances of Tchaikovsky‚Äôs ‚ÄúPique Dame‚Äù. Ten years later, Gian Carlo Menotti invited him to become the Music Director of both Spoleto Festivals in Italy and the US (Charleston), post which he held from 1987 to 1992. Following Gian Carlo Menotti‚Äôs resignation from the Spoleto Festival USA, the board of Directors appointed Spiros Argiris in 1994 as the Artistic Director of Operatic and Symphonic activities of the US Festival which he held until his death.http://spoletousa.org/wpcontent/themes/spoleto2014/pdfs/SFUSAProgramHistoryThrough2013.pdfhttp://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Greek- Conductor-to-Make-His-Mark-at- Spoleto/id-16dd1c022fa4f2582bb0d2e57aff6b56http://www.engagingnews.us/select/Spiros- Argiris.html He conducted contemporary music at the Wittener Tage f√ºr neue Kammermusik.

He said to his daughter Eleanor, \\"A picture is merely an experiment in design. If the design is pleasing, the picture is good, no matter whether composed of objects, still life, figures or birds. Few appreciate that what makes them admire a picture is the design made by the painter.\\" After a day of hunting, Benson brought home a rail and snipe and hammered them to the barn door. He found that he was interested in capturing the two birds and made oil paintings of each.Bedford, 17. Although he was a teenager, he had an exceptional grasp of light and its effects.

In 1999, Wainner was approached by Andover.net, the company that acquired Slashdot.org and that was acquired by VA Linux, with an offer to buy the ResellerRatings and SysOpt.com businesses. Another company, EarthWeb, was also interested in acquiring the businesses, and made a higher bid. Wainner sold both the ResellerRatings and SysOpt.com businesses to EarthWeb in 1999 for $4 million, and went to work for EarthWeb as Editor-in-Chief. In 2001, EarthWeb decided to sell its network of sites, including SysOpt.com and ResellerRatings and other sites, except for Dice.com, to Internet.com, in a transaction valued at $500k, and Wainner transferred to work at Internet.com. Wainner left Internet.com in 2001. In 2002, Internet.com discontinued the ResellerRatings website, and displayed a splash page indicating that the site was being discontinued. Wainner contacted Internet.com seeking to repurchase the site, and negotiated the re-acquisition of the site for $32,000. Wainner took EarthWeb to arbitration to dispute the earn-out portion of the transaction. The arbitrator found that EarthWeb had violated its agreement by offloading the business to Internet.com, and had not properly supported the site. Wainner won the dispute, and received an award of $628,000. By 2008, Wainner's ResellerRatings business was earning $2 Million in revenues per year, with 5 employees. From 2008 through 2012, Wainner hired a team of 12, and worked to grow the ResellerRatings business, reaching annual revenues of $6 Million in 2012 through its subscription platform. In 2012, Wainner sold the ResellerRatings business to Answers.com for $34M, and then worked for Answers.com for 18 months as GM of the ResellerRatings business, until January 2014. Notably, Wainner never took outside funding for the ResellerRatings business, instead bootstrapping the business, and at the time of both of its sale transactions, in 1999 and 2012, Wainner was the sole shareholder of the business with no outstanding debt. In August 2015, Wainner founded Fareness, an airfare booking app that lets consumers see fares across multiple simultaneous dates and destinations. = Angel Investments = Wainner's angel investments include HandUp, a San Francisco based direct giving platform that allows donors to provide assistance to homeless on a community level, Compology, a smart waste management platform that uses sensor technology to help waste companies service only full dumpsters, and Framed Data, an analytics platform that works to predict and reduce SaaS user/customer churn. = Philanthropy = Wainner is a board member of The Pixie Project, a Portland, Oregon based non-profit animal shelter and rescue. Wainner is also a financial contributor to the Pixie Project. In February 2015, Wainner donated $175,000 to the Pixie Project to help it expand its services, increase spay and neuter surgeries, and increase adoptions. = Television Appearances = Wainner was interviewed about online shopping by TechTV's Leo Laporte in the live ScreenSavers show in 2002. He was also featured in a live interview on the G4TV show with Chris Pirillo to discuss the ResellerRatings business.

The name refers to the process of mode deactivation that is based on the concept of cognitive modes as introduced by Aaron T. Beck. The MDT methodology was developed by Jack A. Apsche by combining the unique validation‚Äìclarification‚Äìredirection (VCR) process step with elements from acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and mindfulness to bring about durable behavior change. Theory Mode deactivation therapy (MDT) was developed by Jack A. Apsche who recognized shortcomings of cognitive theory and cognitive-behavioral therapies, especially for the treatment of populations with complex psychological problems. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) was primarily conceptualized through an integration of behavior therapy with cognitive psychology that were formulated by Aaron T. Beck. As such, the CBT approaches focus primarily on the present rather than the past, behavioral change as the main goal, and current processes that are maintaining the problem rather than the root causes. Traditionally CBT views problem manifestation as brought about by dysfunctional thinking, which is disputed as irrational beliefs and replaced with the use of logical arguments. Eventually some practitioners realized that dysfunctional cognitions should not be disputed. As a result, a new wave of cognitive-behavioral therapies began to form, which was termed the \\"third wave\\" by Prof. Steven C. Hayes, who went on to develop Relational frame theory and Acceptance and commitment therapy. (Behaviour therapy was the first wave and Cognitive therapy was the second.) Dr. Jack A. Apsche agreed in general with this principle, but also believed that there is value in exploring the origins of maladaptive thought processes in addition to validating their existence as reasonable given an individual's past experiences upon which his or her core beliefs are based. Aaron T. Beck asserted that how people feel and behave are largely determined by their thought processes or cognitions, which may make us vulnerable to psychological distress. These vulnerabilities are related to personality structures‚Äîa person's fundamental beliefs about themselves and the world around them. Personality structures largely develop as a result of responding to environmental stimuli and experiences. When these are distressing and deprive a person of psychological needs, the coping mechanism may be viewed as maladaptive compared with normal circumstances. The personality structures are referred to as cognitive schemas, which‚Äîin combinations‚Äîinform a person how to behave in a certain situation. Cognitive schemas are often automatically activated and group together to form cognitive modes that are deep-seated and durable behavioral manifestations such as depression and aggression. In MDT these modes and their associated core beliefs are validated and normalized in the client's perspective by cultivating awareness and acceptance rather than disputing any belief as irrational or \\"bad\\". The proposition is that awareness and acceptance improves the therapist-client bond, client cooperation, commitment and motivation, which enables an effective and durable therapeutic change process. Practice The application of MDT integrates the unique validation‚Äìclarification‚Äìredirection (VCR) process step with selected elements from Acceptance and commitment therapy, Dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness (psychology) through a systematic and collaborative case conceptualization and implementation process. =Assessment= The case conceptualization forms the blueprint of the MDT planning and implementation process, and is based on a systematic assessment procedure that is aimed at identifying, clarifying, and formulating the core beliefs ‚Üí fears ‚Üí thoughts and feelings ‚Üí behavior sequence. First, a semi-structured clinical interview is conducted to form the foundation of further psychometric testing. The client typology survey is completed by the therapist with inputs from the client, parent/guardian, family members, and other records, including arrest and medical where relevant. It includes family information, substance abuse, medical, neglect, physical and sexual abuse and offending history, educational, emotional, behavioral, physiological, and interpersonal information. The expectations of treatment and willingness to cooperate are also noted. Second, the Strength of Fears Questionnaire is completed and scored. The 60-item 4-point Likert scale responses is scored to examine five sub-categories of fear, namely personal reactive-external, personal reactive- internal/self-concept, environmental, physical, and abuse. The test is sensitive to the detection of trauma and identifies and rates specific fear and associated situations. Life-interfering fears are also identified. Then, the client completes the Compound Core Beliefs Questionnaire (CCBQ), a 96-item 4-point Likert scale form (short version). The score primarily informs the therapist of the client's personality traits and structure, as well as potential life-threatening and treatment-interfering beliefs. Hereby, the CCBQ helps identify the client's underlying beliefs and thoughts that guide his or her behavior. Each belief is clarified and completed with examples. =Case conceptualization= The results and analyses of the client typology, Fear Assessment and Compound Core Beliefs Questionnaire (CCBQ) are used to compile the Triggers, Fears, Avoids, and Compound Core Beliefs Correlation (TFAB) and the Conglomerate of Beliefs and Behaviors (COBB) worksheets. A situational analysis associate the problem beliefs, fears, and behaviors with triggers to identify the mode activation processes that have to be deactivated. The collaborative case conceptualization process is completed with the Functional Treatment Development Form (FTDF), which informs and monitors the treatment planning and progress. The TFAB form is used to link specific triggers with fears and core beliefs, while the COBB takes the process one step further by associating each core belief with a specific behavior. Now functional alternative beliefs, healthy alternative thoughts and compensatory strategies are identified, which is developed and reinforced through the validation‚Äìclarification‚Äìredirection (VCR) process. =Validation‚Äìclarification‚Äìredirection= The validation‚Äìclarification‚Äìredirection (VCR) of the functional alternative belief is what separates MDT from other CBT-based approaches. In validation, the therapist explores the grain of truth in the client's perceptions or beliefs and views them as reasonable responses given his or her life experiences. In clarification, the content of the client's responses is elucidated while awareness and acceptance is encouraged. In redirection, the therapist moves the client towards accepting a functional alternative belief through commitment and motivation to work towards positive alternatives that are more supportive of his or her life goals and aspirations. =Mindfulness= Mindfulness is defined as a mental state achieved by focusing one‚Äôs awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one‚Äôs feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations. It is helpful to cultivate awareness and acceptance of distressful thoughts and feelings in the present, a state that is necessary to be able to consciously affect change in one's condition. MDT utilizes this perspective to normalize the client's thoughts and feelings, while developing healthier functional alternative beliefs. Remember that problem thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are the products of dysfunctional core beliefs that are often cultivated by distressful events. Applications MDT was specifically developed as a psychotherapy protocol for adolescents with complex problems such as conduct, mood, and mixed personality disorders that are co-existing with trauma-related and substance abuse issues, aggression. This type of psychopathology constellation is typically associated with childhood abuse and neglect. The MDT methodology was proved effective to treat adolescent populations aged 14- to 18-years with a variety of problems. These include Conduct disorder, Oppositional defiant disorder, Substance use disorder, mixed multiple Personality disorder, Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Mood disorder, Aggression, Sexual offending, and Child abuse. In addition to this complex population, other conditions that are often considered as difficult-to-treat also had effective outcomes compared to traditional CBT approaches. These include aggressive narcissistic, antisocial, and psychopathic youth. Although the research studies to date have not included adults or adolescent females, there are no apparent reason why the MDT treatment approach would not be equally effective for these populations. MDT is also applied in a family context. In fact, involving the family in the MDT treatment process has proven to be beneficial to improve collaboration, treatment outcome, and durability of changes. MDT has been applied in outpatient and institutional settings. Evaluation of effectiveness To date, there has been 10 separate MDT research studies. Results of a meta-analysis suggest that there is a large effect size for both family-based and individual Mode Deactivation Therapy (MDT). There was a significant reduction of all negative behaviors from intake to post-treatment and beyond as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAXI-II). Conventional treatments for the same populations produced insignificant change. Applying MDT, the CBCL internalizing and externalizing scales declined by an average of about 35% and the STAXI total anger expression decreased by a similar margin (37%). Comparative improvements with treatment as usual were consistently around 5%. Criticisms In a review of the 2010-book, Nancy Calleja remarked that MDT also incorporated a psychodynamic element by exploring early childhood experiences and deterministic behaviors. \\"Whereas some believe that this type of theoretical eclecticism is precisely what is needed to treat complex issues, others may have difficulty finding coherence in this type of model.\\" (p. 136). Furthermore, as an approach that is claimed to be evidence-based, research that supports the conceptual model remains fairly limited, especially independent studies.

It currently has approximately 10,600 members.LWF Profile The current president of TTMHK is Elder Wong Fook Yee. History The TTMHK was established in its current form in 1952 although it traces its establishment back to the first Basel missions among the Hakkas in Guangdong, China in 1847. Prior to its reorganisation as an independent body, the TTMHK was one of the twenty five districts of the Yuexi Synod (Chongzhen Church) of the Lutheran Church of China. =Early history= Mission work among the Hakka people in Guangdong was initiated with the arrival of Theodore Hamberg and Rudolph Lechler of the Basel Mission in Hong Kong under the guidance of Karl G√ºtzlaff on March 19, 1847. While missionary work was primarily done in the western part of Guangdong, the mission had its home base in Hong Kong.Tsung Tsin Mission of Hong Kong 140th Anniversary Bulletin, 1847-1987 Christian services in the Hakka language began in Hong Kong on February 9, 1851 and the first baptism took place on April 13 of the same year. In 1860, a residential hall and girls' school was established in Sai Ying Pun on Hong Kong Island. A congregation was eventually established in Sai Ying Pun in 1867 which became the mission centre of the Basel Mission in China and is today known as the Kau Yan Church ( or Saving Grace Church). The first Basel church in Hong Kong Island however was established in 1862 in Shau Kei Wan. The first Basel church in Kowloon was established in 1897 in Sham Shui Po while her first church in the New Territories was established in 1905. =Towards self reliance and self governance= In 1924, the Basel Church in China renamed itself the Chongzhen Church () although the official name in English retained the \\"Mission\\" nomenclature. By 1929, the Hong Kong district of the Chongzhen Church had established self-sufficiency and self-governance while retaining ties with the main Chongzhen Church. In 1949, the Chongzhen Church joined the Lutheran Church of China (LCC) as the Yuedong Synod () but the association with the LCC proved to be short as the political circumstances in China changed rapidly over the following two years. The Yuedong Synod was abolished the following year by the LCC which was transitioning rapidly into the Three Self Patriotic Movement. =Independence and consolidation= As a result of the communist takeover, the Hong Kong district of the Chongzhen Church was no longer able to keep in contact with the Chongzhen Church in the mainland and in 1951, ties were officially severed between the district and the Chongzhen Church in China. In 1952, the Hong Kong district of the Chongzhen Church registered itself as an independent organisation using its present name with the Government of Hong Kong and had its first post-registration assembly on 1 July 1957. In 1954, TTMHK became a founding member of the Hong Kong Christian Council (HKCC) as part of the Lutheran Church in Hong Kong. In 1956, the TTMHK became an independent member of the HKCC in its own right. It also helped set up the Lutheran Church of China - Hong Kong Association (later the Hong Kong Lutheran Federation) in 1954 and in 1974 became a member of the Lutheran World Federation. Beliefs and practices The TTMHK is a member church of the Lutheran World Federation, a communion of Lutheran Churches throughout the world. As a church in the Lutheran tradition, it accepts the teachings found in the unaltered Augsburg Confession, Luther's Small Catechism and other confessional articles and symbols of the Book of Concord. Due to its Basel heritage, the TTMHK also accepts the teachings found in the Heidelberg Catechism. The TTMHK accepts the ordination of women as co-workers and pastors in the denomination, and a significant percentage of their full-time workers are women. Structure and organisation The TTMHK is organised along presbyterian lines with Reformed liturgy predominating but theologically Lutheran. Schools and colleges The Chongzhen Church had earlier established the Lok Yuk Seminary in Meixian, Guangdong but the seminary was forced to close in 1952. The Luk Yok Seminary re-opened in Hong Kong in 1955 and was later merged with the Chung Chi Theological Seminary in 1966. Chung Chi Seminary was eventually reorganised as the Divinity School of Chung Chi College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In 1977, the TTMHK co-founded the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Hong Kong together with the Chinese Rhenish Church Hong Kong Synod, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hong Kong and the Taiwan Lutheran Church.Brief Introduction - Divinity School of Chung Chi College The Basel Mission had traditionally invested a lot in education and this legacy is carried on by the TTMHK. The TTMHK currently sponsors or runs six secondary schools, four primary school and multiple kindergartens.È¶ôÊ∏ØÂ¥áÁúüÊúÉ - Á∏ΩÊúÉÊïôËÇ≤ÈÉ® (Chinese) See also * Lutheran Church of China * Christianity in Hong Kong References Further reading * External links *Tsung Tsin Mission of Hong Kong Hong Kong Hong Kong Hong Kong Tsung Tsin Category:1847 establishments in China ","title":"Tsung Tsin Mission of Hong Kong"},{"id":"42357621","text":"The Town of Brisbane colonial by-election, 1864 was a by-election held on 22 April 1864 in the electoral district of Town of Brisbane for the Queensland Legislative Assembly.

Monschke had recently been named head of the Washington chapter of Volksfront. \\"Prosecutors said the attack was meant to lift Monschke's status in the white supremacist movement and to earn Frye a pair of red shoelaces, with the red signifying the drawing of blood.\\" :* Tristain Lynn Frye was sentenced to 13 years, nine months for second-degree murder. :* Scotty James Butters and David Nikos Pillatos pled to first-degree murder, accepted a plea agreement and testified against Monschke in exchange for being able to request that their imprisonment be no more than approximately 30 years. in June 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled \\"a sentence longer than the standard range could not be ordered by a judge without action by a jury, meaning Butters and Pillatos could face no more than 31 years in prison.\\" :* Kurtis William Monschke was convicted of aggravated first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. The incident has been described as a hate crime. * On August 26, 2011, Dane Hall was curb stomped in an attack outside a gay bar in Salt Lake City, Utah.

The song became popular performed by Hank Williams for MGM and reached #4 on the country chart in 1949. Origins A rendering (1927) by Tom Gates and his Orchestra (on Gennett 6184) as \\"The Bucket's Got A Hole In It\\" gives writing credit to musicians Lee Blevins and Victor Sells. This version predates the C. Williams copyright. The original melody evolved from the second theme of \\"Long Lost Blues\\" published in 1914 by J. Paul Wyer and H. Alf Kelley. The \\"Long Lost Blues\\" theme was a variation of \\"Bucket's Got a Hole in It\\", a motif that appears in several versions of \\"Keep A-Knockin\\". This tune later became the basis for several versions of the song, \\"You Can't Come In\\" recorded by multiple artists. However, \\"Bucket's Got a Hole in It\\" has also been attributed to Buddy Bolden, which would date it before 1906. As one critic noted, Hank Williams \\"could have been given this ditty to record, [but] he may have been familiar with this ditty from previous recordings or had heard it while growing up in Alabama.\\" Tom Gates version Tom Gates and his Orchestra performed the earliest known recording of this song on July 25, 1927 (Gennett 6198-A Champion 15307) in St. Paul, Minnesota as \\"The Bucket's Got a Hole in It.\\" Band members included the composers, Lee N. Blevins on trombone and Victor Sells on trumpet. Also playing were Earl Clark, Frank Cloustier (Piano, Director), Bob Gates, Tom Gates, Tracy \\"Pug\\" Mama, Nevin Simmons (Alto Sax/Vocals), and Harold Stoddard. Even in this early recording, the melody had already been used by the New Orleans Rhythm Kings in their \\"She's Crying For Me Blues\\" ('25 - Victor), also by Louis Dumaine's Jazzola Eight in '27 as To-Wa-Bac-A-Wa-Yale Blues. Washboard Sam version Washboard Sam, aka Robert Brown, released a version of this song on Bluebird B-7906 known as \\"Bucket's Got A Hole In It.\\" This recording was made in 1937 as one of \\"several historic blues recording sessions [that] took place on the top floor of the Leland Hotel located in downtown Aurora, Illinois. Lester Melrose, a freelance A&R; man, and record producer, put together those recording sessions for the Bluebird label. Melrose brought together a small group of artists from St. Louis, and some of Chicago‚Äôs finest blues artists of the time, and over the course of the next 20 months, recorded over 300 tracks. \\" Featured in this series of recordings are the performers Tampa Red, Washboard Sam, Big Bill Broonzy, Walter Davis, John Lee ‚ÄúSonny Boy‚Äù Williamson, Big Joe Williams, Henry Townsend, Robert Lee McCoy, Speckled Red, Merlene Johnson, Addie ‚ÄúSweet Peas‚Äù Spivey, Bill ‚ÄúJazz‚Äù Gillum and One Arm Slim, amongst many others. upright Hank Williams version Williams likely first heard \\"My Bucket's Got a Hole in It\\" from Rufus Payne, nicknamed \\"Tee Tot,\\" a black street singer who taught a young Hank to play blues guitar. In the essay to the 1990 Polygram box set Hank Williams: The Original Singles Collection, Colin Escott quotes Williams in an interview with Ralph Gleason in 1952: \\"I was shinin' shoes and sellin' newspapers and following this old Nigrah around to get him to teach me how to play the git-tar. I'd give him 15 cents or whatever I could get ahold of for a lesson.\\" Understandably, producer Fred Rose was wary of the song's commercial potential; as country music historian Escott notes, \\"Fred Rose's opposition to the song had a lot to do with the fact that it mentioned beer, and probably had something to do with the fact that Acuff-Rose didn't publish it.\\" In addition, Williams originally had a couplet mentioning a Ford automobile (\\"Me an' my baby, we got a Ford/Now we change the gears from the running board\\") and Rose demanded that, if Williams did record it, the reference be dropped because if Hank endorsed Ford, \\"then deejays sponsored by GM, Chrysler, and Studebaker wouldn't spin his record.\\" Williams recorded the song on August 30, 1949 at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio (the same session that produced the B-side \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\"). He is backed by members of the Pleasant Valley Boys - Zeke Turner (lead guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), and Louis Innis (rhythm guitar) - as well as Tommy Jackson (fiddle) and Ernie Newton (bass). The song is significant for featuring the only guitar solo Williams ever recorded: :\\"Hank came into the studio with the guitar solo already worked out. He played it twice as he demo'd it for the band, then reprised it on the record, and while it didn't break new ground, it was loose and swinging and wonderfully bluesy. The entire record had a compelling swing that showed just how deeply Hank was immersed in black music.\\" The blues influence is evident in other Williams songs, such as \\"Move It on Over,\\" \\"Mind Your Own Business,\\" and \\"Honky Tonk Blues,\\" but \\"My Bucket's Got a Hole in It\\" remains the song that displays the influence most prominently. Other versions *Murv Shiner recorded the song for Decca. *Dave Denny recorded \\"My Bucket's Got a Hole in It\\" for RCA. *T. Texas Tyler covered the song for 4 Star Records in 1949. The song reached #4 on the country chart. *Fat Man Robinson recorded an R&B; version for Decca that contained the lines to a Ford that Williams had dropped from his version. *Louis Armstrong recorded the song in 1950. *Sonny Burgess released a version as a single in 1957. *Ken Colyer's Jazzmen released a version as a single in 1956 in the United Kingdom. *Ricky Nelson released a version of the song in 1958.

The band announced their breakup on July 21, 2014. The last line-up of the band featured Andrew Hock on vocals and guitar, Ian Jacyszyn on drums and Krallice member Nicolas McMaster on bass guitar. History The band was formed by guitarist Andrew Hock, bassist Daniel Olivencia and drummer Ian Jacyszyn. Jacyszyn performed with the death metal act Copremesis. Hock and Olivencia were a member of the extreme metal acts Biolich and Ehnahre while attending New England Conservatory. After releasing Stones/Salts in 2009, the band signed to Profound Lore Records and released their debut album, Mounds of Ash in 2010, gaining a critical acclaim. After parting ways with two previous bassists, the band recruited Krallice bassist Nicholas McMaster and released their sophomore album, Obsian in 2013. In 2014, the band embarked a North American tour with Canadian black metal band Thantifaxath and performed at Maryland Deathfest. =Breakup= On July 21, 2014, a message was posted on the band's official website announcing their breakup: > Castevet is no more. There is no single reason or event driving this > decision; it is based on the need of each individual involved to continue to > develop their vision within new and existing projects.

Thank you to all who have supported Castevet since our > inception in 2006. =Other projects= Hock went on to form Psalm Zero with former Extra Life singer Charlie Looker although he is no longer with that group. He has also put out a solo guitar record. McMaster's current projects include Krallice and Geryon. Musical style The band's musical style has been described as \\"proggy black metal\\" and \\"math-metal\\". The band's debut album featured a fusion of \\"black metal and noisecore.\\" Phil Freeman of Allmusic also stated that the album \\"takes the tremolo guitar picking and thundering-hooves drumming of black metal and weds them to complex, interlocking riff structures more akin to progressive thrash.\\" The band's second album, Obsian, was described as \\"metal built on math-rock foundations\\" by Grayson Currin of Pitchfork Media. It incorporated influences ranging from punk rock, ambient music, post-hardcore and death metal. The music of the band features \\"death growls akin to hardcore and death metal, unusual chord voicings and polyrhythmic drumming.\\" The basslines of the latest bassist were compared to jazz-fusion music and the works of King Crimson.

He painted galant companies in the style of Watteau under whom he studied. Life He was born in Antwerp, the son of Jan Baptist Nollekens, a genre and still life painter from Antwerp who had practised for a while in the Dutch Republic and England, and eventually settled in Roanne in France. He is believed to have studied under Antoine Watteau, whose style and choice of subject he to some extent imitated; and did study for a time under Giovanni Paolo Panini. Nollekens went to England in 1733. On 21 January 1748, he died at his house in Dean Street, Soho, and was buried at Paddington. According to a contemporary story of Thomas Banks, he was a miser, or had a pathological fear of being robbed of property. Works Portrait of a Family (1740), by Joseph Francis Nollekens When first in England, Nollekens worked on making copies from Watteau and Panini. He also carried out decorative works at Stowe House for Lord Cobham, and painted pictures for the Marquess of Stafford at Trentham Hall. Nollekens found a major patron in Richard Child, 1st Earl Tylney, for whom he painted conversation pieces, f√™tes champ√™tres, and similar works, usually set in the gardens of Wanstead House. Several of these were included in the sale held at Wanstead in 1822, one, an Interior of the Saloon at Wanstead, with an assemblage of ladies and gentlemen, fetching a high price for the time. At Windsor there was a picture by him in which portraits of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and his sisters were introduced. Family Nollekens married Mary Anne Le Sacq or Lesack, by whom he had five children: John Joseph, Joseph, Maria Joanna Sophia, Jacobus, and Thomas Charles. Of them, only Joseph Nollekens remained in England becoming one of the nation's most famous sculptors.

He, along with nearly his entire family, was killed by Taliban gunmen in March 2014. He was 40 years old.  Career  Sardar began his career as a journalist in 2001 with the fall of the Taliban, when he started working as a translator for Japanese journalists. He was hired by Agence France-Press in 2003 to cover the daily briefings by the US-led coalition at Bagram airbase, and became well known in the Afghan media world, and had quickly worked his way up to senior correspondent for AFP at the time of his death. He also headed a successful media firm, Pressistan, which he founded in 2009 to support visiting foreign correspondents and to train local journalists. Interviewed in 2012, Sardar said of his job: \\"I don't think the experiences of a journalist in a country like Afghanistan and a city like Kabul are that pleasant. For example, suicide attacks: we have to go to the scene and look at something very tragic, we have no choice.\\"Ironically his last article was on male lion cub Marjan, on March 19, 2014, which narrated the pathetic state in which Marjan was being housed on a rooftop by a businessman, who had bought the male lion cub as a status symbol for $20,000, and kept his pet on a roof terrace.Marjan the Lion: in remembrance of Sardar Ahmad‚Äôs Final Story  Death  On the evening of March 20, 2014, as Taliban violence was escalating in the run up to the April national elections, Ahmad and his family were having dinner at the Serena Hotel in Kabul, for celebrating the Persian New Year, Nowruz.Sardar Ahmad: The Journalist who was murdered by the Taliban Four Taliban gunmen sneaked weapons into the hotel before going to its restaurant and opening fire; they killed nine people. Four of the dead were Ahmad; his wife Humaira; his daughter, Nelofar (aged 6); and his eldest son, Omar (5). The youngest son, two-year-old Abuzar, was hit with multiple rounds and went into a coma, but survived the attack. According to Afghan officials, the Sardar's family were not the deliberate target of the attack. One of the attackers was believed killed by one of the hotel's armed guards; the rest were killed by Afghan special forces. Surviving son Abuzar may go to Canada to live with an uncle. While they claimed responsibility for the attack, after realising who had been killed, the Taliban insisted the murders of Sardar and his family had been unintentional, a result of crossfire, even going so far as to issue a rare apology for the deaths of the children. Sardar's death was mourned by an eclectic mix of Afghans and foreigners, from President Hamid Karzai, who visited his surviving son in hospital, to former warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum. Many Afghan journalists said they would boycott every Taliban statement and every Taliban-related story for two weeks in protest. Ahmad was described by his bureau chief as \\"[c]lever, informed, stylish and bubbling with boyish enthusiasm, [‚Ä¶] a five-star journalist, a friend to all at AFP‚Äîand a man who impressed every single person he ever met.\\" Mujib Mashal of Harper's Magazine, who met Sardar a month before his death to discuss setting up a magazine, praised his sheer endurance, \\"something increasingly rare in his generation of Afghan reporters, many of whom have moved on to new careers, exhausted by more than a decade of conflict.\\" Fellow Afghan journalist Harun Najafizada noted that Sardar had had any number of opportunities to leave Afghanistan, but had always opted to stay. The UN Security Council condemned the attack, with International Federation of Journalists describing Sardar's murder as a \\"horrifying killing\\", while Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said Ahmad's loss would be felt \\"keenly\\". The American Embassy in Kabul rearranged a press conference so as not to clash with a vigil taking place the Wednesday after his death. His Pressistan Twitter account, which Sardar was always active on, was taken over by his friends to continue as a source of news and views in Afghanistan.

In the United States, the episode originally aired on Comedy Central on January 14, 2014. The episode marks the return of several characters from the previous season, and features Zach Galifianakis in the titular sketch, \\"Cake Train\\". The skit was conceived during the writing of the series' pilot episode; the sketch was rejected for its expense during both the production of the pilot and the first season. The series was renewed for a second season consisting of 10 episodes by Comedy Central in January 2013. The episode, which received generally positive critical reception, was watched by 763,000 viewers and received a Nielsen household rating of 0.4 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Synopsis The episode guest stars Zach Galifianakis (pictured) as the cake tosser in \\"Cake Train\\". The episode begins with the titular skit, \\"Cake Train\\", featuring people rushing to catch cakes being thrown off a moving train by Zach Galifianakis, filmed in slow motion. Afterwards, in a parody reality television series entitled Dad Academy, C-Czar (Nick Kroll) returns to find a child he had with his girlfriend \\"Pretty\\" Liz B. (Jenny Slate) has been birthed, and must learn how to parent. Later, in \\"PubLIZity\\", Liz B. and her co-worker and friend, Liz C.

Lastly, the Oh, Hello men ‚Äì Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland (portrayed by Kroll and John Mulaney) ‚Äì reprise their role in pranking friends and bystanders in their show, Too Much Tuna. Production The \\"Cake Train\\" sketch was conceived during the writing of the series' pilot episode. As it utilizes a moving train, the sketch was rejected as being \\"too expensive\\" during producing of both the pilot and the first season. The series was renewed for a second season consisting of 10 episodes by Comedy Central in January 2013. Bradford Evans of Splitsider described the announcement as a \\"testament\\" to its high ratings, faith in the series by the network and its popularity on the Internet. Nick Kroll jokingly stated the sketch became their \\"priority of the season\\" after its renewal; the skit was shot last during production, and became the most expensive sketch produced in the series. The episode marks the return of characters Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland of Oh, Hello since being featured in the season 1 episode, \\"Too Much Tuna\\". According to Kroll, the characters were conceived through his and John Mulaney's experiences in New York. The episode also reprises C-Czar since being featured in \\"Ice Dating\\" and the characters Liz B. and Liz G. from \\"Please God\\". Katy Perry expressed interest in starring on the show through Twitter; Kroll stated that she wanted cast for \\"PubLIZity\\", but was busy in a recording session with Diplo.

The episode was watched by 763,000 viewers upon its premiere, and received a Nielsen household rating of 0.4 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The episode saw digital distribution on Amazon Video, iTunes and Vudu upon its broadcast. The episode received generally positive critical reception; David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A‚àí, confident that as a season premiere, \\"Nick Kroll and his writers have really nailed down how to present the serialized nature of their sketches over the upcoming weeks.\\" He specifically praised the titular sketch as Impressionistic and found it to diverge from the format of the previous season by \\"[weaving] into the texture of the episode a little bit, giving the audience a strong hit of decadence and absurdity\\". Writing for Paste, Laura Jayne Martin scored the episode 8 out of 10, stating that while most of the sketches didn't make her laugh, she noted it to invoke an experience of \\"internal recognition of humor\\", where \\"the joke or concept is funny, but also displays a keen sharpness that lacerates the reality it mocks.\\" Kroll expressed that the titular sketch \\"is an anomaly within our show in that it's absurdist and it's not terribly character driven. But it's in the spirit of our show in that if we find something funny we'll play it as hard as we can.\\" Erik Voss of Splitsider called the skit \\"beautifully shot\\" and stated the episode's \\"dark undertones, nonsense wordplay, and editing flourishes ... provide the humor here.\\" References External links * \\"Cake Train\\" on Comedy Central  Category:2014 American television episodes ","title":"Cake Train"},{"id":"42357997","text":"Laboral Kutxa is a Basque credit union. It was born in March 2012 as a result of the merging of Caja Laboral Popular Sociedad Cooperativa de Cr√©dito (known as Caja Laboral in Spanish or Euskadiko Kutxa in Basque) and Ipar Kutxa Rural Sociedad Cooperativa de Cr√©dito (known as Ipar Kutxa). The merging project was announced in March 2012 and completed eight months later, in September 2012, although the new company was not officially presented until April 2013. History =Caja Laboral ‚Äì Euskadiko Kutxa= Caja Laboral ‚Äì Euskadiko Kutxa was founded in 1959 by Jos√© Mar√≠a Arizmendiarrieta, a young catholic priest who had arrived to the small town of Mondrag√≥n in 1943 and had since then stablished a technical college and had helped create a few co-operatives, such as ULGOR (later known as Fagor), Funcor (currently Fagor Ederlan), Arrasate (currently Fagor Arrasate) and the San Jose Consumer's Cooperative (later and nowadays known as Eroski). Those co-operatives would be the first members of what is now called the Mondragon Corporation and, according to Arizmendiarrieta's plan, the credit union would serve as a financial instrument for them. Caja Laboral-Euskadiko Kutxa not only played an important role in the creation of the Mondragon Corporation, but also in its development. For five decades, its \\"Companies Division\\" acted as a promoter for new co-operatives. In the seventies, the union gave loans with benefits to the cooperatives that were in difficulties due to the reorganizing of the basque industry and the two energy crisis in 1973 and 1979 when unemployment rates were up to 20% in the Basque Country. Caja Laboral's motto at the time was \\"libreta o maleta\\", meaning being in the union (\\"libreta\\") was the only way to avoid forced migration (\\"maleta\\" ‚Äì suitcase). Not only was Caja Laboral a credit union but also a worker's co-operative, which meant that its workers had a full right to participate both in the company's decisions and its benefits. Before its merging with Ipar Kutxa, Caja Laboral had 1.887 working members, 21.536 million euros in assets, 1.200.000 clients and 367 offices in the Basque Country and Spain. It was the first European financial institution in getting the Gold 'Q‚Äô Basque Award in Management. In 2006 the union supported the United Nations Global Compact. =Ipar Kutxa= It begun as Caja Rural Provincial de Vizcaya, in 1965, and was founded mainly by two co- operatives, the dairy co-op Beyena (that literally means \\"from cows\\" in basque) and Uteco, a farmers co-operative. In 1980 the union changed names to Caja Rural Provincial de Vizcaya, Sdad. Coop. Cto. Ltda and six years later, after avoiding bankruptcy thanks to the intervention of the Bank of Spain it became Caja Rural Vasca (or Baserritarren Kutxa in basque) and begun to grow outside Biscay. En 1997, it slightly changed names again to become Caja Rural Vasca, S. Coop. de Cr√©dito and failed a hostile takeover of Bankoa Cr√©dit Agricole. In 2003, it opened its first offices in Gipuzkoa and officially became Ipar Kutxa (\\"union of the North\\" in basque). When it merged with Caja Laboral, Ipar Kutxa had 3.967 million in assets, 87 offices (mainly in Biscay and Alava), 175,000 clients and 397 workers (fuente). The merging process In March 2012, Caja Laboral and Ipar Kutxa announced the beginning of formal conversations to its merging. They aimed to \\"strengthen a financial institution of social economy, that would provide services in its current market based on an alternative model to the one resulting in Spain as a result of the banking process of credit unions\\". The merged company would be the first credit union and the third largest financial institution in the Basque Country (after Kutxabank and BBVA). It would also make the second biggest credit union in Spain, with 750,000 clients in the Basque Country, 110,000 in Navarre and more than 1,300,000 total. The merging was a gradual process. Between March and November 2012 all operations between companies were made free of charge for clients, IT services became one and older workers were offered early retirement. The merging was completed the first of November but resulting union kept the name Caja Laboral ‚Äì Euskadiko Kutxa until June 2013, when it announced its new brand, Laboral Kutxa. Economic and financial indicators Laboral Kutxa is the first credit union in the Basque Country and the third largest in Spain. It is also the third largest financial institution in the Basque Country (after Kutxabank and BBVA). It has approximately 750.000 clients in the Basque Country and another 110.000 in Navarre, making 1.300.000 total. It employs currently 2.500 workers and makes 24.564 million euros in assets. It has another 650 million euros invested in its social capital and 1.379 million euros in its funds. Management Like Caja Laboral and Ipar Kutxa, Laboral Kutxa is a worker's co-operative. As such, it is obliged to follow Spanish Co-operative Law and the general regulation of worker co- operatives. Although it has no restrictions to perform as a financial institution to its clients it must pay special attention to the needs of its own worker's. Operations with third parties cannot make for more than 50% of the company's total assets. All worker's in Laboral Kutxa are members of the company and had a vote in the General Assembly. Those clients with a strong commitment with the union can also become members if they wish to: in February 2013 Laboral Kutxa allowed them to do so with a small contribution (2.000 euros). These are the people currently in Laboral Kutxa's board of direction *President: Txomin Garc√≠a *Chief executive officer: Xabier Eguibar Offices Laboral Kutxa has approximately 400 offices in the Basque Country, Navarre, Arag√≥n, La Rioja, Castile and Le√≥n, Cantabria, Asturias and Madrid. Marketing and communication For decades, Caja Laboral had used the symbol of a key for branding while Ipar Kutxa had no distinct image apart from its initials or full name. During its merging process, Laboral Kutxa worked with two labels -Euskadiko Kutxa and Ipar Kutxa- and used the corporate colors associated with them -deep red and lime green-. They are currently the most notable colors both in the company's logo, its offices and all of its publicity.

In this episode, Neal finds himself back in Storybrooke and yearns for a way to reconnect with his son Henry, whose memories of his father are gone, while also trying to find his own father, Rumplestiltskin, whom he has just learned is alive but missing, and Regina discovers a possible connection with Robin Hood. Meanwhile, in the Fairy Tale Land of the past year, agonizing over the death of his father, Neal - with the help of Belle and enchanted candelabra Lumiere - attempts to find a magical solution to bring back Rumplestiltskin from the dead. Plot =Opening Sequence= Lumi√®re as a candelabra is featured in the background. =In the Characters' Past= In the Enchanted Forest a year earlier, Belle and Neal talk about Rumplestilskin as they search for clues in his castle on how to find him. As they enter the library to check for any evidence, a voice starts calling for the two, and a face of flame in a candelabra is revealed to be Lumi√®re, who tells them Rumplestiltskin had him entrapped in this form as punishment. He directs them to a key with a triangular sign on it, which opens the vault where the first Dark One was created. A curious Neal agrees to use it to try to bring back his father. Unbeknownst to Neal and Belle, Zelena enters the library, and is pleased that they just fell for her trap: she is using Lumi√®re. As Belle and Neal walk through the woods again, they find the location. Brushing away the snow, Neal finds a circular metal plate with symbols on it. When Lumiere, while ranting, claims he‚Äôs spent over 200 years in the library, Belle realizes that he is lying, for she hknows how long the library has actually been there since Rumplestiltskin built the library specifically for her. Lumiere confesses that he works for Zelena, who cast the spell on him because she wants to find Rumplestlitskin's dagger, not knowing that if Neal does bring back his father, there will be a price to pay. Believing he can save both his father and his family, Neal opens the crypt, and he burns his hand, leaving the marked scar, and bubbling up slowly from the ground comes Rumplestiltskin. As he is finally reunited with Baelfire and Belle, they are interrupted by Zelena. Baelfire then falls to the ground, having learned that he has sealed his fate by saving Rumplestiltskin from Zelena: the process of bringing him back has a \\"life for a life\\" policy. Rumplestiltskin tries to save Baelfire by absorbing him into his own body, but cannot so long as he holds the dagger. Rumplestiltskin releases the dagger and absorbs Neal, but becomes insane as a result. Zelena snatches up the dagger and orders Rumplestiltskin to kill Belle, but Lumiere, deciding to do the right thing, uses his flames to hold Zelena back long enough for Belle to take him up and escape with him. =In Storybrooke= It's one year later in Storybrooke, and, at Granny's Diner, Emma Swan, David, Regina, Captain Hook, and Mary Margaret have a meeting to discuss another search for Mr. Gold since they suspect that he might have escaped the cage. Meanwhile, out in the forest, Zelena starts searching for Gold, and she summons her flying monkey to find him after the dagger she now possesses fails to work. Later at the pawn shop, the group, minus Regina, meets up with Belle. Hook agrees to stay with Belle to protect her, even though she hasn't forgiven him for his actions during their prior encounters or accepted his sincere apology. David and Emma decide that because of her pregnancy, Mary Margaret has to stay home while Emma and David leave to handle the search. Belle and Hook are surprised by Neal, who stumbles into the shop and instantly collapses. Over at the apartment, Zelena has shown up to play mid-wife to Mary Margaret by having her drink a glass of orange juice \\"in order to keep the baby healthy\\". However, the juice was spiked with a spell so Zelena can feel the baby growing inside Mary Margaret. As Emma stops by the inn to check on Henry, he becomes suspicious that Emma isn't telling the truth, but Emma tells Henry that she will, but he must trust her until then. Emma then gets a phone call from Belle that Neal is alive and in the hospital, where they discover a branded scar on his right hand. Emma arrives to see Neal, who says that he was in Storybrooke and was looking his father but doesn't remember how it happened. Emma then takes a picture of his hand on her iPhone and sends it to Belle for research. Neal asks Emma about Henry, but Emma has made up her mind about not telling Henry or restoring his memories. After she leaves, Hook, who is on guard duty, brings Neal some Jello. They talk and bond over lost time, and resolve their differences. Neal tells Hook that he is leaving the hospital to find his father, and Hook decides to give Neal a head start before alerting the others about Neal‚Äôs escape. Meanwhile, Regina decides to check out the farm house, when she hears something and catches an arrow launched by a startled Robin Hood. As they investigate the farm, Regina and Robin get better acquainted, sharing a drink when Robin comes across a bottle of whiskey. However, Regina recognizes something on his wrist: the lion tattoo. She realizes he was the true love Tinker Bell had taken her to meet back in the Enchanted Forest. Regina runs out of the house, leaving behind a confused Robin. Later on in the forest from a distance, she watches as Robin and his Merry Men play with Roland. Around the same time, David and Emma search the forest for any signs of Gold, and they find him after they hear his voice. Emma tries to ask Gold about what happened but he keeps saying that the only thing he hears are voices in his head. The three are then greeted by the flying monkey, prompting them to split up. David injures the beast to slow him down while Emma runs after Gold, only to hear Neal's voice and she finds him instead. The pair resumes the search for Gold as Neal tells Emma that he has not given up on her and Henry. When Belle calls Emma to tell her that the scar on Neal‚Äôs hand resulted from attempting to bring Gold back from the dead, Emma drops her phone. As Emma watches Neal changing into Gold, he begs Emma to use her magic to separate them. Emma uses her magic to separate father and son, but Neal dies since he had sacrificed his life to bring his father back. Gold tells Emma that Zelena was the Wicked Witch of The West and that Emma, the savior, is the only one who can stop Zelena from carrying out her scheme. They mourn with Neal, who tells them that he loves them and Henry, before he dies. Emma and David rush to the apartment to capture Zelena but find she has escaped through a window. They tell Mary Margaret about Zelena's true identity and that Neal is dead. Mary Margaret and Emma share a hug as Emma grieves her loss, and they go to Gold's shop, where Mary Margaret breaks the news, hugs, and comforts Belle. Back in the forest, Gold sits next to Neal's body, and a gloating Zelena appears with his dagger, using it to control him. Gold tells Zelena (who reveals to him that she is after Mary Margaret's unborn child) that now everyone knows who she is, but since she has his dagger to control him, it doesn't matter anymore now that he has control of his brain. She tells him to go back to his cage, where he continues to mourn his late son. Moments later, Emma walks up to Henry at the park and they sit on a bench, where she admits to him that he was right about her not being honest with him about the case, saying that Neal was the client that hired her, but she was too late and he was gone. Emma tells Henry that Neal was a great man, a good father, and a hero. Henry, who says he wishes he could have known him, asks her what happened to the person who did it, and Emma says they got away, but she vows to Henry and to herself that she will find them. Reception =Ratings= The episode managed to maintain the same rating numbers from the previous outing, placing a 2.1/6 among 18-49s, but averaged only 6.46 million viewers, down slightly from the last episode.\\"TV Ratings Sunday: 'Revenge','Resurrection', 'Believe' & 'Crisis' Down, 'Once Upon A Time' & 'The Simpsons' Steady\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (March 31, 2014) =Critical reception= The episode was met with mixed to positive reviews. Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly gave it a good review but summed it up this way: \\"Considering Once's history, I'm still not totally convinced that this is the One True Death we were promised. For every really, most sincerely dead character on this show (Cora, Pan, Sheriff Skinnyjeans), there's one whose death stuck about as well as an old Post-It note (the Blue Fairy, Rumpel, Prince Phillip). Until we see Emma spreading Neal's ashes in a Tallahassee swamp, I will refuse to believe that there isn't the slightest possibility of him returning just in time to make the twisted Charming/White/'Stiltskin family tree whole again.\\"'Once Upon a Time' recap: Really, Most Sincerely Dead?\\" from Entertainment Weekly (March 30, 2014) Christine Orlado of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.4 out of 5 stars. Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+, noting that \\"This pondering led me to wonder what I would do to fix the show right now, if I were able. OUAT‚Äôs still excels at reinterpreting of fables and legends, like the off-kilter look at Rapunzel in the previous episode. We‚Äôve seen an Evil Queen progress from a villainous character to one whose flawed heart now is open to more possibilities. But numerous characters running around for an hour searching for the Wicked Witch is not compelling, and does nothing for the show overall. And inspiration from recent Disney interpretations would probably not be as effective as more elements from the classic Grimm tales.\\" The review also took note of how the producers handled Neal/Baelfire's death scene: \\"Michael Raymond-James gamely played every troublesome hand he was dealt with this part, but there just wasn‚Äôt much good there. He played a tear-inducing death scene, though, and Jennifer Morrison brought it as well, but plotwise it‚Äôs almost an afterthought.\\" References External links  Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 3) episodes ","title":"Quiet Minds"},{"id":"42358089","text":"Duden is a German surname.

He made his debut for the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, in 2016. He is half Samoan and half NZ European. Career =Early career= Lienert-Brown began his career in Christchurch, where he caught the eye with some excellent performances for Christchurch Boys' High School in the 2012 South Island finals. This began a rapid ascent for the young second five-eighth who was in line to be part of the squad for the 2013 ITM Cup until a shoulder operation that required surgery ruled him out. Nonetheless 2012 and 2013 Super Rugby champions the included him in their 2014 squad as part of the franchise's wider training group. He made his Super Rugby debut on 29 March 2014 in a 34‚Äì34 draw against the in Pretoria. Starting the game in an unfamiliar role on the wing, he was replaced by Tim Nanai- Williams in the 51st minute. =2016‚Äì2017= After Charlie Ngatai was ruled out for the rest of Super Rugby with a serious concussion, Lienert-Brown became a regular starter for the Chiefs in the 2016 Super Rugby season. Lienert-Brown was called into the All Blacks' Rugby Championship squad for the injured Sonny Bill Williams, making his debut in the starting line up against in Wellington on 27 August 2016, following concussion to Ryan Crotty. Lienert- Brown had a great game and set up winger Israel Dagg for a try off the first touch in his international career. Lienert-Brown lasted nearly the whole 80 minutes before being replaced by Chiefs team-mate Seta Tamanivalu in the 76th minute. Lienert-Brown replaced Crotty off the bench in home victories over Argentina and South Africa, before overtaking Malakai Fekitoa as Crotty's midfield partner in the absence of Williams. Lienert-Brown established this when he made the second start of his career in the second test against Argentina on 1 October 2016, scoring the opening try (the first of his international career) and lasting the whole 80 minutes of the All Blacks' 36-17 victory. Lienert-Brown started another five times in 2016, scoring the second try of his international career in the third Bledisloe Cup test against Australia before being replaced by Fekitoa in the 62nd minute of the All Blacks' 37-10 win over the Wallabies. Lienert-Brown was not subbed off in any of his three appearances on the 2016 end-of-season tour. Lienert-Brown was selected in the All Blacks' 33-man squad for the 2017 Pasifika Challenge against Samoa and three-test series against the touring British and Irish Lions. Lienert-Brown started in the midfield with Sonny Bill Williams in the 78-0 victory over Samoa and scored the first New Zealand try of 2017 11 minutes into the test. With Ryan Crotty returning from a hamstring injury, Lienert-Brown was relegated to the bench for the first test against the Lions. This happened only for Crotty to repeat his hamstring injury in the 33rd minute with Lienert-Brown replacing Crotty off the bench. The All Blacks won the test 30-15. Lienert-Brown started in the second and third test against the Lions, setting up midfielder-turned fullback Jordie Barrett for his first test try. The All Blacks went on to draw the third test 15-15, leaving the series drawn overall. Lienert-Brown played the full 80 minutes in both the second and third test. Lienert-Brown spent the 2017 All Blacks season as an on-off regular starter, replacing another player off the bench eight times and starting for the All Blacks six times in 2017. His 2017 season included a try- scoring performance in his start against Argentina on 9 September 2017, as well as an outstanding performance against Wales in the final test of 2017 where he also scored a try off a pass from winger and man-of-the match Rieko Ioane in the 33-18 victory. =2018‚Äì2019= The 2019 Super Rugby season proved to be a brilliant return to form for Lienert-Brown, who, despite playing 11 tests during the season, had a quiet 2018, having been usurped by Jack Goodhue in the national pecking order. Lienert-Brown's performances for the Chiefs throughout 2019 were outstanding, allowing the Chiefs to make the playoffs despite a rollercoaster season. Lienert-Brown, who made more offloads than any other player throughout the season, was subsequently selected for the 2019 Rugby Championship. New Zealand had a shaky start to their 2019 season, with Lienert-Brown starting in the All Blacks' record 26-47 loss to Australia, their joint-heaviest defeat of all time, with Lienert-Brown scoring one try of New Zealand's four. However, the team stepped up significantly for the second Bledisloe Cup test in 2019, with Lienert-Brown winning Man of the Match in the 36-0 thrashing at Eden Park. On 28 August, All Blacks Head Coach, Steve Hansen named Lienert-Brown as one of 31 players in New Zealand's squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Having already accumulated 38 caps since his debut, Lienert- Brown's form supplanted 50-test veteran, Sonny Bill Williams, his childhood hero, from New Zealand's starting lineup, starting alongside Ryan Crotty in the first test of the World Cup, a 23-13 win over South Africa. Personal life Lienert-Brown's older brother, Daniel, is also a professional rugby player, currently playing for the Highlanders in Super Rugby. In 2019, Lienert-Brown opened up about struggles with mental health, citing them as difficulties in his past.

Early life Gansworth was born in 1965http://newsandevents.buffalostate.edu/news/exhibition-examining-native- american-images-past-and-present-opens-october-13 and is an enrolled citizen of the Onondaga Nation; however, he grew up in the Tuscarora Nation as a descendant of one of two Onondaga women present among the Tuscarora at the foundation of the nation in the 18th century. Gansworth originally qualified in electroencephalography, considered a profession useful to his nation; however, he went on to study literature and to continue a lifelong interest in painting and drawing. Work Gansworth has written five novels, including the award-winning Mending Skins (2005) and Extra Indians (2010). In all his novels, illustrations form an integral part of the reading experience. His critically acclaimed first young adult novel, If I Ever Get out of Here, deals with the friendship between two boys, one a resident of the Tuscarora Nation, the other living on the nearby Air Force base. In a starred review, Booklist stated that the book succeeded in \\"sidestepping stereotypes to offer two genuine characters navigating the unlikely intersection of two fully realized worlds.\\" Gansworth states that growing up he was struck by an absence of images of contemporary Native American life to use as drawing practice, noting that \\"I could offer images from the Planet of the Apes, The Towering Inferno, Spiderman and, of course, Batman, but I had a critical shortage of Indian drawings.\\" Subsequently, in his literary studies he was again critical of the lack of American Indian authored texts offered on his courses. Much of his current literary and artistic drive can be seen as attempting to overcome this lack of attention. Gansworth himself sees the two themes most important to his work as being \\"the ways history informs the present\\" and also a strong interest in entertainment culture. Critic Susan Bernardin has analyzed Gansworth's writing via Gerald Vizenor's concept of survivance, suggesting that his novel Mending Skins \\"suggests how Native peoples reimagine patterns of loss into new stories, especially through humored stories of survivance.\\"Susan Bernardin, \\"As Long as the Hair Shall Grow:Survivance in Eric Gansworth's Reservation Fictions,\\" in Survivance, ed. Gerald Vizenor (Lincoln: Nebraska UP, 2008), p. 124.

It revolves around a young photographer named Leonardo Watch, who obtains 'the All Seeing Eyes of the Gods' at the cost of his sister's eyesight. After the incident, Leonardo moves to the city of Hellsalem's Lot to join an organization known as Libra to fight several monsters as well as terrorists. Nightow first published a one-shot chapter in Shueisha's sh≈çnen manga magazine Jump Square in May 2008. A 3-chapter series, with the subtitle Maf≈´gai Kessha, was published in the same magazine from January to March 2009. Blood Blockade Battlefront was then serialized in Jump SQ.19 from May 2010 to February 2015, when the magazine ceased publication. Shueisha compiled its chapters in ten tank≈çbon volumes. A direct sequel, titled Blood Blockade Battlefront: Back 2 Back was then serialized in Jump SQ.Crown from July 2015 until January 2018, when the magazine ceased publication, and the series was transferred to Jump SQ.Rise in April 2018. A 12-episode anime television series produced by Bones was broadcast from April to October 2015. A 12-episode second season was broadcast from October to Decmeber 2017. In North America, the manga has been licensed for English language release by Dark Horse Comics, while the anime series has been licensed by Funimation. Both the manga and anime were well received by publications due to its story and characters. Plot Blood Blockade Battlefront centers around the crime fighting organization \\"Libra\\" and their battles in Hellsalem's Lot, formerly known as New York City. Hellsalem's Lot was created when a portal to the \\"Beyond\\" opened, becoming a paranormal melting pot of monsters, magic and the everyday mundane life, and it is up to Libra to clear the streets of trouble and prevent the horrors of this city from spreading to the outside world. Characters =Libra= The primary members of Libra (from left to right): Zapp, Steven, Chain, Klaus, Leonardo (with Sonic on his head), K.K., and Gilbert. ; : : A kind and humble young photographer who came to Hellsalem's Lot to help his ailing sister. A mysterious entity gave him the , granting him a variety of powerful ocular powers, at the cost of his sister's sight. His eyes have their limits; when overused, they have a tendency to \\"shatter\\", causing his eyes to bleed. He tends to be bullied by Zapp and his lack of fighting skills usually puts him in danger, especially against those who covet his power. ; : : Leader of Libra. A large, very powerful man with a distinctive underbite, he is actually very well composed and gentlemanly and honest to a fault, with an unshakable will. Master of the , which he can use to create large cross-shaped weaponry and seal away enemies. Klaus is also very intelligent, being able to play a chess-like called Prosfair for a period of ninety-nine hours against a being that has studied the game for thousands of years. : His ultimate technique allows him to imprison the Blood Breeds, as they can not be killed due to their immortal nature, but to do so, he must learn the enemy's true name, thus requiring Leo using his powers to reveal it. ; : : A hot-blooded, womanizing Libra member and master of the 's Kagutsuchi branch, which allows him to manipulate his blood into blades and explosions. He is very well trained, being able to keep up with beings much faster than what the human eye can normally follow. His juvenile actions often get him and the rest of Libra into trouble. He is Leonardo's partner and despite his usual attitude, he cares about him in some way. He is always trying to defeat Klaus in a battle but is always the one to lose. ; : :A suit-clad werewolf with the power of invisibility and collaborator from the organization. She can move at high speeds (being able to keep up with Zapp's chain of explosions from one end of the real world to deep into the alter-world) and does a large portion of Libra's reconnaissance work. Her personality is sadistic, often causing physical harm to others or showing indifference to those in peril (mainly to Zapp for his womanizing tendencies). However, she is shown to be somewhat caring of her teammates at certain points in the series, mostly evidenced towards Leo. Her power is erasing her presence, which needs a link (a chain) to connect her to the world in order to counter the effect of her ability or she will cease to exist. ; : : Libra's second-in-command. A shady man with many connections. Master of the , a kick-based fighting style that freezes enemies on contact. He is a gentleman, like Klaus. ; K.K. : : A lively and confident Libra member who sports an eye patch, who can be very impatient at times, but also motherly. She is very devoted to her husband and two young sons and fights with using high-power guns that electrocute enemies. ; : :Two men in one body. Dog Hummer is a handsome man who had his blood replaced with the liquefied body of the serial killer and \\"bad boy\\" Deldro Brody. Brody can materialize as a gigantic living armor that surrounds Hummer called , granting him immense physical strength. The two are often kept sealed away in the deepest part of Hellsalem's Lot's largest prison but are sometimes called up to aid Libra in dire situations, due to their raw power. Based on Carnage. ; : : A stern merman with similar powers to Zapp, as they were both taught by the same master. However, Zed's ability is wind-based, unlike Zapp, who is fire- based. Joins Libra after being abandoned by his master in Hellsalem's Lot. Zed is trained to use the Shinatobe branch of the Big Dipper blood-fighting style, which generates Tridents and threads from his blood. Based on Abe Sapien. ; : : Klaus' butler and member of Libra. His face is covered with bandages, making him appear similar to a mummy. He is known for being a famous combat butler, and has regenerative powers. He drives a custom vehicle with many weapons, and is very fierce despite his even demeanor. Handles most of Libra's intelligence work. ; : :Klaus' former mentor and world-famous vampire hunter. His nickname is the result of the many curses placed on him by his vampire enemies that he has made over the years. Whether it's due to his luck or the curses counteracting each other, Abrams has never actually been harmed from it. However, countless people have fallen victim to the curse in his stead which has left him to be rightly feared by some of his colleagues at Libra. ; : :Libra's arms craftsman, dealer and occasional combatant. ; : :Patrick's ponytailed assistant, very skilled and also gluttonous, having spent an entire Libra office party just eating food. ; : :A monkey that's capable of moving at the speed of sound, also known simply as Sonic. It steals Leonardo's camera, but eventually becomes his pet after Leo saves him. =Others= ; : :The self-proclaimed , ruler of Hellsalem's lot, and the ringleader of a powerful crime syndicate operating in the city known as the Thirteen Kings. Known for his sadistic personality and tendency to stir havoc in Hellsalem's lot merely for the sake of excitement. To this end, he's always willing to give his enemies a chance to win (though he'll often throw temper tantrums when they do). ; : :The . She is the one who fused Dog and Deldro in order to create her \\"ideal boyfriend\\" with the power and ruthlessness of the latter and the handsomeness of the former. As her title of monomania implies, when Aligura finds something she wants, she'll devote everything she has to get it without any regard for whatever may stand in her way. ; :The , considered the hardest of the Thirteen Kings to handle. Theodora is said to reside in the deepest part of Hellsalem's Lot. She possesses such a sensitive nervous system that it is able to detect almost all activity in the city. Through contracts, she is also capable of improving the nervous systems of others to a similar level provided they can handle the stress of it. ; : :Leonardo's little sister whose sight was stolen by a demon who forcibly implanted the \\"All Seeing Eyes\\" on her brother. The events of the series are narrated to her by Leonardo. ; : :A girl working at a diner that Leonardo usually frequents. She cares about him quite a bit, comforting him with food or drink when he needs it. ; : :Master of the diner. ; : :Powerful mob boss of the alterworld, and huge fan of Prosfair. Being made out of various brains, and with the ability to bend space and time, Arlelelle's skill on Prosfair is insurmountably high. Because of this, he does favors to humans who win Prosfair endurance matches against him; losers give the \\"remainder of their lives\\" to him, their minds incorporated into Arlelelle's brains so as to continue playing the game against him until life's end. Klaus is a friend of Arlelelle's, having endured 5 matches against him, and thus Arlelelle is much more lenient and accepting of Klaus' requests. ; : :Nicknamed \\"Neji\\", a beyondian with a huge affinity for hamburgers from the segregated franchise Jack & Rocket's (a take on Johnny Rockets). He has physical characteristics similar to a mushroom, and releases memory-erasing spores when put through heavy stress. The power of the spores is evident: he does not remember his mother and neither does his mother remember him. Leonardo bought hamburgers for Neji, and the two became friends; however, after certain events happened in the series with people trying to sell Neji's spores as weapons, Neji releases spores that are too powerful, and thus he and Leonardo must restart their friendship, as they have forgotten each other. \\"Neji\\" means \\"screw\\" in Japanese. So he was designed as short plus screw shape. ; : :A legendary blood fighter, considered a , founder of the Big Dipper style blood technique and the master of Zapp & Zed. It is not known if he is alien or human, as he lost most of his body during blood training, being only an arm and a barely visible face under a tattered robe & a wild boar skull. With a biting personality and brutal discipline of training, he and Zapp stood on acrimonious terms. Known for disappearing for decades at a time and taking down high-ranked Blood Breeds, he comes to Hellsalem's Lot while fighting the Blood Breed Herlelle Lucando Lozo Thietkaua gi Murmhavat, along the way rigorously testing Zapp and leaving Zed at the hands of Libra, before a sudden disappearance. ; : :Police officer who requests cooperation from Libra on risky situations in exchange for not arresting the organization. ; : :Code name used by the secretary of the League of High Order Spirituals.

A mysterious and beautiful girl that appears before Leo and becomes friends with her. She is, in reality, not a human, but a sentient barrier, one of the many (not sentient ones) holding back the Great Collapse from happening. The reason for her still being on the Earth is by her parents' sacrifice to make her part of the barriers. At the end of the first season, she sacrifices herself to completely reseal the Great Collapse again, as the rest had been destroyed by her brother. Her brother aids her in this feat, being repentant of his actions. Though she dies at the climax of the first season, the second season strongly implies that her spirit is watching out for Leo. Her real name is . ; : :An original anime character. White's older twin brother who shares his body with the , one of the Thirteen Kings who has an interest in Leo. Black had taken up the mantle of a blood breed host in order to save his sister.

Reception The manga series of Blood Blockade Battlefront received generally good critical response. Dustin Cabeal from Comic Bastards said \\"The writing is strong and the dialogue is very sharp.\\" He also praised Nightow's art calling it \\"unique.\\" Additionally, he referred to it as \\"strange at first, but it‚Äôs quickly become one of my favorite of all time.\\" Brigid Alverson from MTV Geek criticized the artwork for being hard to follow and stated \\"it boils down to a matter of taste. Blood Blockade Battleground is a good choice for readers who like a lot of action and don't mind being dropped into the middle of the story, without a lot of setup.\\" On the other hand, The Fandom Post's John Rose praised the artwork more specifically the monsters' designs. He highly recommended it to Triguns readers as well as superhero comic reader, sci-fi hero and Futurama fans. Several of the volumes have also appeared in rankings for bestselling manga. The anime adaptation of the series has received generally positive reviews. Jacob Hope Chapman from Anime News Network praised the cast and studio Bones' work. Additionally, he liked the consistency in quality and commented \\"The contiguous threads laced through these episodic adventures are beginning to converge fast, and while I can't see the full picture yet, I know Rie Matsumoto is building the anime-original material of Leo's romance into something special. The animation continues to be jaw-dropping. The music continues to be soul-warming. There's never enough time in one writeup to talk about everything that makes the episode so damn good. Blood Blockade Battlefront continues to be The Very Best.\\" Jarius Taylor from the Fandom Post called it \\"both ridiculously cool and ridiculously weird\\" and praised the cast like Chapman. In a later review he said \\"It‚Äôs still not entirely clear what this show is going for yet but for now it‚Äôs a good ride and I have more than enough faith in the people behind it to believe the destination will be worthwhile.\\" Rachael Verret, a writer from The Mary Sue, gave the series a perfect score having pointed out its \\"energy and joviality\\" seen through the cast and the ending sequences which reminded her of another series, Baccano!. Similarly, Chapman wrote an article titled \\"Three Reasons Why Blood Blockade Battlefront is the Best Show of the Spring\\" commenting \\"It's the coolest, cutest, and cleverest anime I've seen in a long time, easily the best new show of the Spring 2015.\\" The first DVD of the series sold 4,784 units during its debut. Meanwhile, the first Blu-ray sold 12,171 units in its first week of release. For the Newtype preliminary awards for 2015, the series was sixth in the category \\"Sound\\" while fourth in the category \\"Theme Song\\" for \\"Sugar Song to Bitter Step.\\" In the category \\"Best Mascot\\", Sonic ranked first. In another poll by the Japanese magazine Entermix, the series was voted as the second most popular one.

Hong has developed the method of synthesizing large-scale graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which triggered chemical researches toward the practical applications of graphene. His papers reporting the large-scale growth of graphene have been intensively cited by many graphene researchers, showing the originality and the significance of his research. Graphene, the world thinnest material combines seemingly mutually exclusive material properties, which are of great importance for the flexible transparent conducting electrode market: it is at the same time both the best electric conductor we know and yet optically almost transparent; it is the world‚Äôs strongest material and yet extremely flexible/bendable. Since its discovery in 2004 it has revolutionized our understanding of two dimensional crystals and their potential for device applications. The rapid development of graphene research and its impact on material science culminated Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for its discovery. Hong's contribution in large-area graphene synthesis has been recognized by Nobel committee, which is being exhibited in Nobel Museum. The unique electronic properties of this two dimensional carbon sheet are also of great interest to the semiconductor industry and have received considerable attention from leading high tech companies such as IBM, SAMSUNG, LG, Nokia, Google and Apple. Here, its potential for ultrafast transistors, energy storage and in particular flexible transparent conducting electrodes for, e.g. foldable touch screen panels generate most of the excitement. From a purely application point of view the key breakthrough took place in 2010: The founder of GSI have invented an industry compatible growth (CVD) and transfer (Roll-to-Roll) process enabling the large scale synthesize of graphene for commercial applications.(Bae et al., Roll-to-roll production of 30 inch graphene films for transparent electrodes. Nature Nanotechnology. 2010, 5, 574.; Kim et al., Large-Scale pattern growth of graphene films for stretchable transparent electrodes. Nature 2009, 457, 706.). The related key patents have been registered in Korea, US, Japan, and China. Hong is also the founder of GSI pioneered the large-scale synthesis of graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which triggered chemical research toward the practical application of graphene. His first report on CVD synthesis of graphene (Nature 2009) has recorded the world highest citations in chemistry among the papers published since 2009 (roughly 5000 times). One year later, he developed the synthesis of ultra-large graphene based on roll-to-roll methods and its application to flexible touch screens (Nature Nanotechnology. 2010), which is believed to be the first demonstration of application of graphene materials in practical electronic devices. For this contribution, he was invited to give a talk in the Nobel Symposium on Graphene (2010). He made more than 90 patent applications on graphene synthesis and applications, which corresponds to the world 2nd graphene-related inventor. Hong's research has been highlighted by Bloomberg, Businessweek, BBC, CNBC, New York Times, Financial Times, Russia Today, MIT Technology Review, C&EN; News (cover story), Physics Today, and Physics World. He is now acting as Scientific Advisory Committee member of ‚Ç¨1 billion Graphene Flagship project together with 4 Nobel Laureates and as Scientific Advisory Member of Cambridge Graphene Center, UK. He is currently an Advisory Member for CTO of LG Electronics. He served as a member of R&D; Strategy and Planning Committee for Korean National Graphene Commercialization Project.

There were many different clubs and gyms from all over Palestine that were considered to be a part of the Federation. The main games that the Arab Palestine Sports Federation supported were football and weightlifting. In 1948 when the federation failed, sport was not widely practiced throughout the region. Failure is credited to lack of resources and athletes in the area. After the failure of the federation, boxing became a phenomenon in Palestine. Boxing was brought to the region by British soldiers. While the soldiers were invading tournaments were held around the area.http://search.proquest.com/docview/99849255  See also  *Palestine Marathon  References  Category:Sport in the State of Palestine Category:History of the Palestinian territories ","title":"History of sport in Palestine"},{"id":"42358364","text":"Robert Roberthin (3 March 1600 ‚Äì 17 April 1648) was a German Baroque poet. He wrote under his own name, as well as the anagram Berrintho.  Course of life  Roberthin was the son of a Lutheran pastor. In 1616 the Roberthin family moved to K√∂nigsberg. In 1617 Robert Roberthin started studying law at the University of K√∂nigsberg. The next year he continued his studies at Leipzig University and in 1620 at the Jean Sturm Gymnasium in Strasbourg, where he found lodgings with the linguist Matthias Bernegger. He would maintain a correspondence with Bernegger for many years. Roberthin's father died in 1620 and in 1621 Roberthin returned to K√∂nigsberg without a diploma. There he obtained a job as a private tutor. Short biographyExtensive biographyThe Neue Deutsche Biographie on Roberthin In the years 1625-1633 he travelled extensively. He departed together with his patron's son. They visited the Dutch Republic. There he found a new patron, with whom he travelled to England. From England he crossed the Channel to France, where he took up several jobs until he returned to K√∂nigsberg in 1630. In the same year he departed again with a new pupil to travel to the Dutch Republic, France and Italy. In the Dutch Republic he befriended Hugo Grotius, who had temporarily returned from banishment. They kept corresponding until Grotius' death in 1645.Kelletat, p. 348. Roberthin returned in 1633 and the next year he found a job as a secretary at the Order of Saint John in Sonnenburg (S≈Ço≈Ñsk). In 1636 he became court clerk at the court of justice in K√∂nigsberg. In 1639 he married Ursula Vogt. By now he was influential enough to get his friend Simon Dach appointed professor of poetry at K√∂nigsberg University in 1639. In 1636 he founded the Gesellschaft der Sterblichkeit Beflissener (‚ÄòSociety of Zealous Mortals‚Äô), together with a group of friends. The society was a meeting point for poets and musicians who were interested in religious poetry and music. The ten to twelve members met regularly in the garden of Heinrich Albert, the K√∂nigsberg Cathedral organist. Albert grew pumpkins, so the circle of friends also took the name K√ºrbish√ºtte (‚Äòpumpkins greenhouse‚Äô). Later scholars often called them the K√∂nigsberger Dichterkreis (K√∂ningsberg Circle of Poets). Its members recited their poems and made music together. In 1641 the municipal authorities put an end to these meetings by expropriating the garden to build houses there. Other well-known members apart from Roberthin and Albert were the poets Simon Dach and Valentin Thilo the Younger and the Kapellmeister Johann Stob√§us.‚ÄòSimon Dach und der Freundeskreis der K√ºrbislaube‚Äô Though their meeting point had disappeared, the K√ºrbish√ºtte members kept in touch after 1641. In 1645 Roberthin was appointed Geheimrat of prince-elector Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia and first secretary of the Prussian government. In 1648 he suddenly died of a stroke. At Roberthin's request Simon Dach wrote already many years before his death the song that had to be performed at his burial. Heinrich Albert took care of the melody. The result was Ich bin ja Herr in deiner Macht, which is still being sung in the German Lutheran church.Text of Ich bin ja Herr in deiner Macht  Works  One of Roberthin's friends was the Silesian poet Martin Opitz, whom he met in Strasbourg. His own poems shown Opitz‚Äô influence. Dach and the other members of the K√ºrbish√ºtte shared his admiration for Opitz. In 1638 Opitz visited K√∂nigsberg and enjoyed their hospitality.Kelletat, p. 301. Probably not all of what Roberthin wrote has been preserved. The biggest part of what is left can be found in the eight volumes of Arien und Melodeien, the bundles of songs by Heinrich Albert, who put many of Roberthin's poems to music. In Albert's bundles Roberthin's songs are usually ascribed to Berrintho, Roberthin's anagram. Also some occasional poetry, usually printed on one sheet of paper in a limited edition, is still extant. Together with Johann Freinsheim he published an edition of the works of the Latin poet Publius Annius Florus in 1632.

Benzie was born in 1902 in Glasgow and took the equivalent of a degree in German at Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford. She then became a secretary at the BBC in 1927. This was just two years after it first had de facto national coverage in Britain. She was working for ¬£150 a year as assistant to the head of the Foreign Liaison department, Major CF Atkinson. She was also gathering material for talks given by Vernon Bartlett on his programme The Way of the World. In 1932 Atkinson resigned and Benzie was given his role. Her salary increased to ¬£500 a year but this was much less that her former boss had been paid. Benzie's career continued and her salary was increased by ¬£100 every year with a ceiling being set at ¬£1,250 per year. In 1933 she was head of that department and in 1937 she married a BBC producer, Royston Morley. They had one child, a daughter. She had not been given a degree because she was a woman so she had to leave the BBC now that she was married to another of their employees. Another source says that she opted to leave and her resignation meal was attended by Lord Reith. The marital rule was relaxed during the war and she returned to organise talks on aspects of health. She and Janet Quigley played a key role in October 1957 in the launch of Today on BBC Radio 4 which she had named. She edited the programme and was its first senior producer. She took it from a programme for \\"people on the move\\" to the important step of having its own named presenter. Quigley and Benzie complemented each other's careers.

Lambertian Reflectance model gives an illumination invariant representation which can be used for recognition. The Lambertian reflectance model is widely used for modeling illumination variations and is a good approximation for diffuse object surfaces. The DLN is a hybrid undirected-directed generative model that combines DBNs with the Lambertian reflectance model. In the DLN, the visible layer consists of image pixel intensities v ‚àà RNv, where Nv is the number of pixels in the image. For every pixel i there are two latent variables namely the albedo and surface normal. GRBMs are used to model the albedo and surface normals. Combining Deep Belief Nets with the Lambertian reflectance assumption, the model can learn good priors over the albedo from 2D images. Illumination variations can be explained by changing only the lighting latent variable. By transferring learned knowledge from similar objects, albedo and surface normals estimation from a single image is also possible. Experiments demonstrate that this model is able to generalize as well as improve over standard baselines in one-shot face recognition. The model has been successfully applied in reconstruction of shadows facial images, given any set of lighting conditions. The model has also been tested on non-living objects. The method outperforms most other methods and is faster than them.

The founders were scientists Jasbir Seehra, Tom Maniatis, Mark Ptashne, Wylie Vale, and scientific advisor Joan Massague, and business people and investors John Knopf and Christoph Westphal of Polaris Venture Partners, who served as founding CEO. The company was founded to discover and develop drugs based on the scientific discoveries of the scientific founders in the field of growth factors and transforming growth factors in the fields of metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, and muscle-wasting conditions. The company began with a seed round from Polaris of $250,000 and then had a Series A venture capital investment of $25 million that it used to open its first laboratory in December 2003. Glenn Batchelder was appointed president and CEO in June 2004. It started its first clinical trial in June 2006; the product was ACE-011 (which eventually was named \\"sotatercept\\"), a protein therapeutic that was an activin type 2 receptor antagonist intended to treat bone loss. ACE-011 was a chimeric protein, created by fusing the binding portion of the activin type 2 receptor to part of an antibody; the resulting protein binds to activin and prevents it from acting. A muscular Belgian Blue cow Knopf took over as CEO in 2007. He became known for showing pictures of a Belgian Blue cow to potential inventors, as a way of illustrating the company's products' potential to develop muscle. In 2008 Acceleron and Celgene started a partnership to jointly develop and market ACE-011 in which Celgene paid Acceleron $50 million up front and bought $5 million of Acceleron stock, and agreed to buy $7 million more in stock if Acceleron went public, and agreed to pay up to $510 million in milestones. In a separate deal done at the same time, Celgene acquired an option to license three products in Acceleron's pipeline directed to cancer and cancer-related bone loss. In 2011 Acceleron extended its their partnership with Celgene to include ACE-536, a development candidate for anemia; Celgene paid $25 million upfront, with potential downstream payments of $217 million in milestones and royalties over 10%. The company held its initial public offering in September 2013. At that time, the company had three protein therapeutic candidates being studied in 12 Phase 2 clinical trials, including sotatercept and luspatercept (ACE-536) which promoted red blood cell production and were being tested as potential treatments for anemia in people with thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS); its other candidate was dalantercept (ACE-041), an angiogenesis inhibitor as a potential cancer drug. In September 2016 Knopf retired and the company hired Habib Dable as CEO; at that time the company's lead product luspatercept was in Phase III testing for MDS and beta-thalassemia. Acceleron experienced a drop in its share prices in 2019, after announcing that it will discontinue the development of an experimental drug meant to treat the rare genetic disease called facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. The termination of the drug's development has been partly due to shareholders' concerns regarding the costs associated with it.

She was the first female professor appointed at Durham University and was Professor of Archaeology from 1971 to 1990. She served as President of the Society of Antiquaries of London from 2001 to 2004. Early life and education Cramp was born on 6 May 1929 in Cranoe, Leicestershire, England. She grew up on her father's farm in Leicestershire. She was educated at Market Harborough Grammar, a grammar school in Market Harborough, Leicestershire. At age 12, she found evidence of a Roman villa on her family land at Glooston. Cramp went on to study English language and literature at St Anne's College, University of Oxford. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree; as per tradition, her BA was later promoted to Master of Arts (MA Oxon) degree. She remained at St Anne's to complete a postgraduate Bachelor of Letters (BLitt) degree in 1950; her thesis concerned the relevance of archaeological evidence in relation to Old English poetry. Academic career Cramp began her academic career at her alma mater, the University of Oxford. She was a fellow and tutor of English at St Anne's College, Oxford, from 1950 to 1955. In 1955, she moved to Durham University as a lecturer in archaeology. The Department of Archaeology was officially created the following year, in 1956, and specialised in Roman and Anglo-Saxon archaeology. She was promoted to senior lecturer in 1966. She became the first female professor at Durham University when she was appointed Professor of Archaeology in 1971. She retired in 1990 and was appointed Professor Emerita. On her retirement, The Rosemary Cramp Fund was established by the Department of Archaeology at the University of Durham to recognise individuals and groups who make a significant contribution to the archaeology and heritage of Britain and Ireland. In 1992, she was a visiting fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. Outside of her university work, she has held a number of voluntary positions. From 1975 to 1999, she served as a member of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. She was a trustee of the British Museum between 1978 and 1998. From 1984 to 1989, she was a member of the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England (now known as Historic England). She served as Chairwoman of the Archaeology Data Service from 1996 to 2001. Cramp has held a number of senior appointments within academic organisations. She was President of the Council for British Archaeology from 1989 to 1992, and has been an Honorary Vice-President since 1992. She was President of the Society for Church Archaeology from 1996 to 2000. From 1992 to 1997, she was Vice-President of the Royal Archaeological Institute. She was President of the Society of Antiquaries of London from 2001 to 2004. =Excavations at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow= From 1963 to 1978, Cramp excavated at Monkwearmouth‚ÄìJarrow Abbey, leading the team which discovered remains of the seventh and eighth-century buildings. A final excavation occurred in 1984. At the same time, Cramp was helping to develop and launch the Corpus of Anglo-Saxon Stone Sculpture. Prior to the excavations, little was known of the physical buildings beyond Bede's written references. During excavations, some of the earliest stained glass in Britain were discovered; the glass also compromises the largest collection of seventh and eighth- century stained glass in Western Europe. On reflecting on the excavation, Cramp described the moment, saying that the shards of glass \\"looked like jewels lying on the ground.\\" Cramp's excavations also revealed the later communities on the site, dating from the 11th to the 16th-century. The excavation reports were published in 2005 and 2006 through English Heritage. In 2012, a bid to secure the site World Heritage status was launched, but the application was later suspended. The bid described the importance of the site noting \\"its direct association with Bede, Biscop and Bede's teacher Ceolfrith makes it one of the most influential monastic sites in Europe.\\" Honours On 8 January 1959, Cramp was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA). In 2006, she was elected Fellow of the British Academy (FBA). In 2008, she was awarded the Gold Medal of the Society of Antiquaries of London; it is awarded \\"for distinguished services to archaeology\\". In 1987, Cramp was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In the 2011 Queen's Birthday Honours, she was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) 'for services to scholarship'. She has been awarded a number of honorary degrees.

She was awarded Honorary Doctor of Letters degrees by University College Cork in June 2003 and the University of Leicester in 2004. A Festschrift was published in Cramp's honour in 2001. It was titled Image and Power in the Archaeology of Early Medieval Britain: Essays in Honour of Rosemary Cramp, and was edited by Helena Hamerow and Arthur MacGregor. Contributors included Nancy Edwards and Martin Carver. As second honorary volume was published in 2008; edited by Catherine Karkov and Helen Damico, √Üedificia nova: Studies in Honour of Rosemary Cramp focused on the art, archaeology and literature of Anglo-Saxon England, and included an article by Cramp herself.

The large Jewish population has led to a significant impact on the culture of Los Angeles. The Jewish population of Los Angeles has seen a sharp increase in the past several decades, owing to internal migration of Jews from the East Coast, as well as immigration from Israel, France, the former Soviet Union, the UK, South Africa, and Latin America, and also due to the high birth rate of the Hasidic and Orthodox communities who comprise about 10% of the community's population.

The tensions subsided by 2009. =Israelis= Israeli and other Jewish Americans celebrating Yom Ha'atzmaut at the Celebrate Israel Festival in Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles Los Angeles is home to the largest population in the Israeli diaspora, with more than 250,000 Israeli Americans live in the Los Angeles, according to the Israeli American Council. The Israeli community of Los Angeles mainly residents in the San Fernando Valley and Westside of Los Angeles. The communities of Encino and Tarzana in particular are noted for their large Israeli populations. Many Israeli Americans in Los Angeles are first, second, or third-generation Americans and are the descendants of early Israeli immigrants arriving in the 1950's; while others are more recent immigrants who began moving to Los Angeles in a wave of migration that began in the 1970's continued to this day. The Israeli American community of Los Angeles has risen to prominence in local business, government and culture. Los Angeles is home to the world's first Israeli Community Center (ICC), similar to a JCC, located in the San Fernando Valley.. =Russian Jews= Los Angeles is home to approximately 25,000 Russian-speaking Jews, and has the second- largest population of Russian Jews from the former Soviet Union in the United States, after New York. =Latinx Jews= As of 2006, there were approximately 11,000 Latinx Jews living in Los Angeles especially in the West Hills area. =Moroccan Jews= The Moroccan Jewish community in Los Angeles is one of the largest in North America, approximately 10,000 Moroccan Jews reside in the Los Angeles area, mostly in Pico-Robertson, North Hollywood, and Beverly Hills. Many are the descendants of community members who first emigrated to the United States in the aftermath of World War II. Many others came later in the 20th century from Israel, and beginning in the early 21st century from France due to increasing antisemitism there. Most are adherents to Orthodox Judaism, with some belonging to the Haredi, Reform, and Conservative Judaism as well. The community has their own synagogues as well as a community center. =Rhodeslis= The Los Angeles area has been estimated to home to 900 Rhodeslis as of 2005. The first members of the Rhodes Jewish community settled in the neighborhood of Ladera Heights, in South Los Angeles , beginning in the early 20th century. The Rhodeslis came to Los Angeles fleeing antisemitism and for opportunity. Ladera Heights was the heart of the Rhodesli community for decades. Rhodeslis spoke Ladino at home and established their own synagogue, the Sephardic Hebrew Center; which later merged with Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel in 1993. Beginning in the 1960's and 70's the Rhodeslis began to leave Ladera Heights due to redlining, and moved to other neighborhoods in the city. Today the Rhodeslis are scattered across LA County and some of them fear assimilation into the broader Los Angeles Jewish community and the loss of their unique culture and traditions. Ladino is still spoken by some members of the community, especially those who are older or are particularly interested in their ethnic history. Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, the Rhodesli community of Los Angeles started a unique custom which continues to this day, annual trips to Catalina. Every summer a number of Rhodeslis (40 as of 2005), board the ferry to Catalina Island to embark on a group trip where they can connect with their shared culture and history. An influential member of the community, Aron Hasson once stated to the Jewish Journal, \\"It was natural to them to take a boat across the water to an island nearby.\\" They visit Catalina Island because its location resembles that of Rhodes in relationship to Turkey. The Mediterranean island of Rhodes was once the center of an important Sephardic Jewish community with its own unique culture and customs. The Jews of Rhodes, who called themselves Rhodeslis, lived peacefully under the Ottoman rule, preserving the medieval form of the Ladino language they took with them following the Inquisition and their expulsion from Spain in 1492. Rhodes was invaded by the Nazis in 1944, and Rhodes Jews were among the many sent off in cattle cars to their deaths in concentration camps. Many of the Rhodeslis who survived the Holocaust and fled World War II and its aftermath immigrated to Los Angeles, because there was an existing Rhodesli community in South Los Angeles, and the area‚Äôs Mediterranean climate and coastline reminded them of their former home. =Yemenite Jews= Beginning with the wave of Israeli immigration to Los Angeles which began in the mid-20th century and continues to the present-day, a number of Yemenite Jews from Israel came to Los Angeles and mainly established themselves in the areas of Pico-Robertson, Santa Monica, and Encino; where several restaurants offering Yemenite Jewish cuisine exist. There are a number of synagogues in the Yemenite tradition, most notably Tifereth Teman on Pico. Many Yemenites also attend synagogues catering to the general Mizrahi Jewish community of the city. In 1964, several dozen members of the Yemenite community began to meet pray in the Yemenite dialect of Hebrew in their homes, community rooms, and even a bank basement. For the High Holidays they would rent a room in local synagogues. For the next 18 years the Yemenites did not have their own synagogue. In the fall of 1986, they purchased a three-bedroom home in a residential area on Hayworth Avenue which they then converted to use as the first Yemenite synagogue in Los Angeles, Tifereth Teman. The move was met with opposition by some of the neighbors, some of whom were Jewish, many of whom were not Jewish and were White; which led to accusations of antisemitism by some members of the synagogue. The synagogue also attracted supporters, mostly within the local Orthodox Jewish community. Some older Orthodox residents of the neighborhood began to attend services at Tifereth Teman out of convenience as it was the closest synagogue to their homes. Opponents of the synagogue filed complaints with the city zoning board as the building was zoned residential. The synagogue was said to have the support of local councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who later declared himself to be neutral in the face of community opposition. In 1987, Tifereth Teman lost their zoning battle and was ordered to close. This decision was later appealed by the clergy. Tifereth Teman later moved to another building with the proper zoning, where it remains today. =South African Jews= As of 1986, more than 500 South African Jews reside in Irvine, in Orange County outside of Los Angeles. Most South African Jews in Los Angeles are Orthodox and go to shul or a Chabad center. History The history of the Jews in Los Angeles includes significant contributions in the arts and culture, science, education, architecture and politics, and began with Jacob Frankfort's arrival about 1841. =19th century= In 1841 Jacob Frankfort arrived in the Mexican Pueblo de Los √Ångeles in Alta California.

In 1854 Joseph Newmark arrived in Los Angeles and helped found the Hebrew Benevolent Society for the evolving Jewish community, after organizing congregations in New York and St. Louis. The first organized Jewish community effort in Los Angeles was their acquiring a cemetery site from the city in 1855. The Hebrew Benevolent Society Cemetery was located at Lookout Drive and Lilac Terrace, in Chavez Ravine, central Los Angeles. Present day historical marker for the \\"First Jewish site in Los Angeles\\" is located south of Dodger Stadium, behind the police academy, in the Elysian Park area. In 1910 the bodies were moved to the Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles. The oldest congregation in Los Angeles started in 1862, a Reform denomination, it is the present-day Wilshire Boulevard Temple congregation. In 1865 Louis Lewin and Charles Jacoby organized the Pioneer Lot Association which developed an eastern Los Angeles area, later known as Boyle Heights. In 1868 Isaias W. Hellman (1842‚Äì1920) and partners formed the Farmers and Merchants Bank in the city. In 1879 he was on the board of trustees to create the new University of Southern California.About USC: History. University of Southern California. In 1881 Hellman was appointed a Regent of the University of California, was reappointed twice, and served until 1918. =20th century= From 1900 to 1926 there was no distinct Jewish neighborhood. 2500 Jews lived \\"downtown\\" which in 1910 was described as Temple Street (the main Jewish Street) and the area to its south. In 1920, this was described to include Central Avenue. Smaller groups lived in the University, Westlake, and wholesale areas. Except for University, these areas steadily declined between 1900 and 1926. In 1900 two Jewish community historians stated that \\"there were far too few Jews to form a definitively Jewish district.\\"Romo, Ricardo. East Los Angeles: History of a Barrio.

This increased to 5,795 Jews in 1910, 10,000 in 1917, 43,000 in 1923, and 65,000 in the mid-1920s.Romo, Ricardo. East Los Angeles: History of a Barrio. University of Texas Press, July 5, 2010. , 9780292787711. p. 95. In 1902, the Kaspare Cohn Hospital (1902‚Äì1910), which later became Cedars of Lebanon Hospital (Melrose/Vermont), and eventually Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was established in Angelino Heights. From 1902 to 1905 it treated tuberculosis sufferers from Eastern sweatshops, until rich neighbors forced them to stop treating TB patients. In 1906, the Sinai Temple was organized. It was the first Conservative congregation in Los Angeles and the first Conservative synagogue built west of Chicago. From completion in 1909 to 1925 the congregation worshiped at 12th and Valencia Streets. The congregation moved to Westwood in 1961. In 2013 the building was purchased by Craig Taubman who created the not for profit Pico Union Project a multi faith and cultural Center. In 1911 the Hebrew Sheltering Association began, eventually becoming the Jewish Home for the Aged, now in Reseda. In the 1920s, after an initial period in the Northeast and Midwest, significant numbers of Jewish immigrants and their families moved to Los Angeles, eventually making Boyle Heights home to largest Jewish community west of Chicago. However, the Johnson-Reed Immigration Act of 1924 established annual quotas for immigrants from Europe and sharply limited migration of Southern and Eastern Europeans. However, the population of Jews in Los Angeles continued to increase rapidly as they moved West. In 1927, I.M. Hattem, a Sephardic Jew, opened the first supermarket in America. The first Sephardic synagogue in Los Angeles was dedicated in 1932. In 1935, a mass meeting was held at the Philharmonic Auditorium to protest against the treatment of the Jews in Germany. In 1936 the Los Angeles Jewish Community Council was incorporated, the present day Jewish Federation Council. In 1940 Los Angeles had the seventh largest Jewish population of all the cities in the United States. Large numbers of Jews began to immigrate to Los Angeles after World War II. 2,000 Jews per month settled in Los Angeles in 1946. Almost 300,000 Jews lived in Los Angeles by 1950. Over 400,000 Jews lived in Los Angeles, about 18% of the total population, by the end of the 1950s. By the end of the 1970s, over 500,000 Jews lived in Los Angeles.Gurock, p. 38.

Retrieved on April 2, 2014. Today, Hancock Park (as well as the adjoining Beverly-La-Brea District) is home to a rapidly expanding Chassidic Jewish population with the majority of the Chassidic Dynasties represented in strong number. As of 1990 the majority of Iranians in Beverly Hills were Jewish. By that year many Iranian restaurants and businesses were established in a portion of Westwood Boulevard south of Wilshire Boulevard. Jews have increasingly settled within the city of Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley and in the Conejo Valley city of Thousand Oaks. When Jews settled in Los Angeles, they were originally located in the Downtown area. Industrial expansion in the Downtown area pushed the Jews to Eastside Los Angeles, where The Los Angeles Jewish community formed in the years 1910‚Äì1920. The Brooklyn Avenue-Boyle Heights area, the Temple Street area, and the Central Avenue area were the settlement points of Jews in that period. In the 1920s the Jewish population saw Boyle Heights as the heart of the Jewish community. In 1908 Boyle Heights had 3 Jewish families. In 1920 there were 1,842 Jewish families there. In the mid-1920s about 33% of all of the Jews in Los Angeles lived in Boyle Heights. By 1930 almost 10,000 Jewish families lived in Boyle Heights. Since 1953, every representative of the City Council's 5th District has been Jewish. By the 1980s, a large number of Jews moved to the Pico-Robertson neighborhood in Los Angeles' Westside. They joined an already established community of German Ashkenazi Jews who settled the area in the 1910s, and a newer population of Iranian Jews who had fled the revolution. Today, the neighborhood is home to a substantial Jewish community, with over six major Jewish private schools, and over thirty kosher restaurants (including Chinese, Mexican, Israeli, Thai, Delis, Steakhouses, and more), over twenty Synagogues, and five mikvahs. Other Jewish communities in Southern California of various denominations and nationalities are in Orange County, Riverside County (esp. the Coachella Valley with its resort city Palm Springs) and San Diego. As of 2007, 90,000 Jews were estimated to reside in Orange County. Demographics According to a 2007 study by Pew Research, the Jewish population of Los Angeles has been said to be the most racially-diverse in North America; with 8% being of mixed race and 7% being Hispanic or Latinx. Jewish students comprised 4% of the student body of the Los Angeles Unified School District in 2007. Los Angeles also had the highest percentage of adherents to Reconstructionist Judaism in the nation, who were to estimated to number 7% of the local Jewish community. Media =Film= Jews played a major role in creating the film industry in Hollywood during the first half of the 20th Century. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 20th Century Fox, Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Warner Bros. were all started and led by Jews, almost all of them recent or children of immigrants from Germany and Eastern Europe. In his book An Empire of Their Own, Neal Gabler wrote that in the movie industry, there \\"were none of the impediments imposed by loftier professions and more entrenched businesses to keep Jews and other undesirables out.\\" Gabler also argued that because of discrimination in a predominately WASP America due to their Jewishness, \\"the Jews could simply create new a country--an empire of their own, so to speak . . . an America where fathers were strong, families stable, people attractive, resilient, resourceful, and decent.\\" The 20th Century American Dream was to a considerable degree depicted and defined by Hollywood.BLACKS & JEWS Very quickly, Protestants attacked the movie industry as a Jewish conspiracy to undermine \\"Christian\\" and \\"American\\" morals, especially in a period of large-scale immigration from southern and eastern Europe. Such beliefs in Jewish control, power, and conspiracy are traditional elements of anti-Semitic thinking. The role of these \\"Hollywood Jews\\" has been debated for years, but one thing is agreed on: most of them avoided identifying themselves as Jews at all, since their major desire was to assimilate and be accepted by the non-Jewish white establishment. Some African Americans, angered by negative images of blacks in movies and by the small number of major black directors and producers from the 1910s to 1960s, raised charges that Jews in Hollywood were both stereotyping and also unfairly excluding blacks. Hollywood leaders responded that there was no conspiracy controlling Hollywood and that Jews in the industry had been leading supporters of liberal causes, including civil rights and the expansion of black participation in the industry. In more recent times, the role of Jews in Hollywood has become less central, but individual Jews are still leaders in the industry. =Newspaper= The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles is a local Jewish newspaper. The Jewish Home Los Angeles is one of the local weekly newspapers in Los Angeles. Politics Eric Garcetti, the current and first- elected Jewish mayor of Los Angeles Jewish voters usually vote in favor of politically liberal candidates or causes, but may vote differently in order to protect their interests/causes.Sonenshein, p. 190. By 2008 Jews made up about 33% of white voters in Los Angeles, while in 1993 they made up 25% of the white vote.Sonenshein, p. 196. Jewish voters in the San Fernando Valley tend to be more politically conservative while those in the Los Angeles Westside tend to be more liberal; Jews in both areas largely support the Democratic Party.Sonenshein, p. 196, 198. Jews vote in favor of immigrants.Sonenshein, p. 198. Raphael J. Sonenshein, in \\"The Role of the Jewish Community in Los Angeles Politics,\\" wrote that the Jewish community had a significant impact in Los Angeles politics even though it is proportionally a small part of the city's population.Sonenshein, p. 189. In the 1970s the Westside Jews were in favor of desegregation busing in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) while those in the San Fernando Valley opposed it. In previous eras Jews and blacks formed a political coalition although this coalition later declined after Tom Bradley stepped down from his position as Mayor of Los Angeles. That year the Jewish vote was split between mayoral candidates Richard Riordan and Mike Woo.Sonenshein, p. 199. Jews opposed Proposition 187, which passed in 1994. In 1997 80% of Jews supported the LAUSD school bond, then the largest such bond in history; and 71% of Jews supported Riordan against Tom Hayden. Jews supported Antonio Villaraigosa as Mayor of Los Angeles in the 2001 primary; while he had a slim margin with Westside Jews in the 2001 runoff, the Jewish vote went to James Hahn. However Villaraigosa received most of the Jewish vote in the 2005 election.

Cuisine The Number 19 Sandwich from Langer‚Äôs Deli, consisting of pastrami, coleslaw, Swiss cheese, and Russian dressing served on double-baked Jewish rye bread, and served with a pickle spear. The Jewish cuisine of Los Angeles is vibrant and varied, and some dishes which have unique to it include the Number 19 sandwich from Langer's Deli. Historically the Jewish cuisine of Los Angeles resembled that of New York, until the later 20th century when more restaurants opened serving Persian Jewish and Israeli cuisine, among others. The influences of these cuisines, as well as Californian cuisine, the organic food movement, and the plentiful local produce have created a new unique Los Angeles Jewish cuisine. There are also a multitude of kosher restaurants through Los Angeles serving Jewish, Persian, Israeli, Moroccan, Yemenite, Chinese, Indian, Mexican and others. Notable Jewish restaurants in Los Angeles include: * Canter's Delicatessen * Langer's Delicatessen * Wexler's Deli * Bavel * The Milky Way, a kosher dairy restaurant in Beverly Grove founded by Leah Adler, and owned by Steven Spielberg * Western Bagel * Bibi's Bakery * Harissa Restaurant and Bakery ‚Äì Pico-Robertson * Koleh Farangi- Persian kosher restaurant on Pico Boulevard * Beverly Hills Kosher Thai- The only kosher Thai restaurant in the United States * Jeff's Gourmet Sausage Factory ‚Äì Fairfax District * Koleh Farangi- Persian kosher restaurant on Pico Boulevard Notable Jewish grocery stores in Los Angeles include: *Western Kosher, a classic kosher grocery store located on Pico off La Brea Education Milken Community High School Yeshiva University Boys High School Milken Community High School is located in Bel-Air.

To date, he has published more than 240 refereed research papers, and book articles, edited several books, among them the Handbook of Protoctista (1990), and wrote books in German ranging from General Botany (1974, 1984) to an Illustrated Guide to Freshwater Algae (2004, 2012). Melkonian holds 15 patents and is Co-Founder of Algenion GmbH & Co. KG, an algal biotec company. Melkonian studied the structure, function and development of the flagellar apparatus in algae and co-discovered several centrosomal proteins novel for eukaryotes (e.g. centrin, SF-assemblin). He further provided evidence that flagellar development in unicellular eukaryotes extends over more than one cell cycle generating flagella with different functions in the same cell. Through the study of the biogenesis of extracellular scales in green algae, the cisternal maturation model of intra-Golgi apparatus transport was revived. Studies on the eyespot apparatus of green algae eventually led to the identification of the photoreceptor channelrhodopsin and the emergence of the research area optogenetics. Melkonian also studied the systematics, diversity and evolution of algae with emphasis on green algae, cryptophytes, and euglenophytes but also heterotrophic protists, such as the Picozoa. Molecular phylogenetic analyses helped to identify the flagellate Mesostigma as the earliest divergence in the Streptophyta and the Zygnematophyceae as the likely sister group to the embryophyte land plants. The cercozoan photosynthetic amoeba Paulinella chromatophora was discovered as an example for the evolution of photosynthetic organelles through a second primary endosymbiosis independent of the origin of plastids. Additionally, his group developed a novel technique to grow microalgae at technical scale immobilized on Twin- Layers.

(1985), ‚ÄúThe Economic Analysis of the Multinational Enterprise: Reading versus Japan?‚Äù, Hitotsubashi Journal of Economics, Vol. 26 No. 2, pp. 117-24 Some are based in the Department of Economics and in Henley Business School at the University of Reading, England, but membership is international. The Reading School builds upon the pathbreaking theoretical work of Peter Buckley and Mark Casson on internalization theory.Buckley, P.J. and Casson, M.C. (1976) ‚ÄúThe Future of the Multinational Enterprise‚Äù, New York, Holmes and Meier This was complemented by simultaneous work by John Dunning as he developed the eclectic paradigm of international business as an envelope explanation containing three principal drivers of foreign direct investment, comprising ownership (O); location (L); and internalization (I).Dunning, J.H. (1977) ‚ÄúTrade, Location of Economic Activity and the MNE: A Search for an Eclectic Approach‚Äù, in Ohlin, B., Hesselborn, P., and Wijkman, P.M. (Eds) , ‚ÄúThe International Allocation of Economic Activity: Proceedings of a Nobel Symposium Held at Stockholm‚Äù, Macmillan, London, pp. 395-418Dunning, J.H. (1981) ‚ÄúInternational Production and the Multinational Enterprise‚Äù, Allen and Unwin, London The Reading School approach continues through the work of its academic disciples around the world, as well as through The John Dunning Centre at Henley Business School, University of Reading, under the directorship of Rajneesh Narula. Henley Business School Origins and Growth The term ‚ÄòReading School‚Äô was first identified in 1978 by the Japanese economist Kiyoshi Kojima (1920‚Äì2010),Kojima, K. (1978) ‚ÄúDirect Foreign Investment : A Japanese Model of Multinational Business Operations‚Äù, Croom Helm, London, 246pp when he criticized the explanation of the post-war growth of multinational enterprises made by scholars at the University of Reading. Kojima argued that Western multinationals were monopolies that distorted the international allocation of resources rather than improved it.Kojima, K. (1982) ‚ÄúMacroeconomic versus International Business Approach to Foreign Direct Investment‚Äù, Hitotsubashi Journal of Economics, Vol. 23 No. 1, pp. 1-19 The Reading School, by contrast, emphasized the efficiency gains that multinational enterprises can generate in a world of imperfect markets.Rugman, A.M. (1981) ‚ÄúInside the Multinationals: The Economics of Internal Markets‚Äù, Columbia Press, New York. Reissued by Palgrave Macmillan in 2006 as Inside the Multinationals, (25th Anniversary Edition), Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke They argued that multinationals shared technologies between parent firms and subsidiaries, and between one subsidiary and another, thereby transferring technologies to countries that did not have the resources to develop them themselves.Narula, R. and Zanfei, A. (2005) ‚ÄúGlobalization of Innovation: The Role of Multinational Enterprises‚Äù, in Fagerberg, J., Mowry, D.C., and Nelson, R.R., ‚ÄúThe Oxford Handbook of Innovation‚Äù, Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK, pp. 318-47Narula (2013) ‚ÄúExploring the Paradox of Competence-creating Subsidiaries: Balancing Bandwidth and Dispersion in MNEs, Long Range Planning. The Reading School accepts that high-technology firms may possess a degree of monopoly power, but it argues, following Joseph Schumpeter, that monopoly profits can reward innovation. The Reading School approach argues that under certain conditions it is best for society to allow multinationals to decide for themselves whether to retain control of their technologies through foreign investment or to partner with local firms instead.Dunning, J.H. (1958) ‚ÄúAmerican Investment in British Manufacturing Industry‚Äù, Allen and Unwin, London Internalization theory and the eclectic paradigm have been refined over the last 40 years to become the bedrock explanations of multinational enterprise activity. The founder members of the Reading School were John Harry Dunning (1926‚Äì2009), Peter Buckley, Mark Casson, Robert Pearce University of Reading and John Cantwell. Rutgers University Dunning was Head of the Department of Economics at the University of Reading, 1964-87 (later Professor at Rutgers University, New Jersey), Buckley was Research Fellow at University of Reading in 1973-4 (later Professor at University of Bradford and University of Leeds), Casson was lecturer in Economics (later Professor and Head of Department) at University of Reading, Pearce was Research Fellow (later Professor) at University of Reading and Cantwell was Research Fellow (later Professor) at University of Reading and then Rutgers University. Buckley and Casson promoted internalization theory, whilst the others promoted Dunning's eclectic paradigm. Cantwell later espoused an evolutionary resource-based view of multinationals, while simultaneously also contributing to the eclectic paradigm.Cantwell, J., Dunning, J.H. and Lundan, S.M. (2010) ‚ÄúAn Evolutionary Approach to Understanding International Business Activity: The Co-evolution of MNEs and the Institutional Environment‚Äù, Journal of International Business Studies, Vol. 41, pp. 567-86Cantwell, J. and Narula, R. (2001), ‚ÄúThe Eclectic Paradigm in the Global Economy‚Äù, International Journal of the Economics of Business, Vol. 8 No. 2, pp. 155-72 Aside from scholars based at University of Reading, visiting scholars in the 1970s and 1980s were instrumental in debating and refining the Reading School approach. Canadian economist Alan M. Rugman (1945-2014) visited in 1976/77 on sabbatical, and in subsequent years, Rugman became an influential exponent of the Reading School approach, extending internalization theory to address policy issues in business taxation and trade regulation. He returned to University of Reading in 2008 and was Head of International Business and Strategy in Henley Business School. Other notable visitors were Seev Hirsch, founding member of the Leon Recanati Graduate School of Business Administration at Tel Aviv University; Tel Aviv University Stephen Magee (University of Texas at Austin); David Teece, visiting in 1989, now at University of California, Berkeley; Thomas G. Parry, visiting in 1975; and Masahiko Itaki in the late 1980s. In 1988 the business historian Geoffrey Jones (academic) Harvard Business School joined the economics department, and Reading School thinking began to influence business and economic history (Jones left in 2002 and is now Professor of Business History at Harvard Business School). Sarianna Lundan, a Ph.D. student of John Dunning at Rutgers University, joined University of Reading in the late 1990s before moving on to Maastricht University and then University of Bremen. Lundan, along with Dunning late in his career, continued to extend the Reading School approach to multinational enterprise.Dunning and Lundan (2008) ‚ÄúMultinational Enterprises and the Global Economy‚Äù, Edward Elger, Cheltenham Further Contributions of the Reading School A second area where Reading School theorists have made a significant impact has been the innovation and research and development performance of multinational enterprise. Major contributions have been made in this area by Robert Pearce, whose 1989 book was one of the first systematic analyses of the behaviour of the research and development activities of subsidiaries of multinational enterprise.Pearce, R. (1989) ‚ÄúThe Internalisation of Research and Development‚Äù, St. Martin‚Äôs Press, New York In parallel, John Cantwell has integrated internalization theory with the economics of technological change and Schumpeterian and evolutionary economics.Cantwell, J. (1989) ‚ÄúTechnological Innovation and Multinational Corporations‚Äù, Basil Blackwell, Oxford Rajneesh Narula and Simon Collinson have established conceptual linkages between multinational enterprise activities and their use of outsourcing alliances within national systems of innovation.Narula, R. (2003) ‚ÄúGlobalization and Technology: Interdependence, Innovation Systems and Industrial Policy‚Äù, Polity Press, Cambridge, UK A third area of focus for the Reading School is how multinational enterprises affect economic development. Originally developed by Peter Buckley and John Dunning, this takes a macro-view of the interaction of multinational enterprise on structural change in countries. The first published paper by John Dunning Dunning, J.H. (1981) ‚ÄúExplaining the International Direct Investment Position of Countries: Towards a Dynamic or Developmental Approach‚Äù, Weltwirtschaftliches Archives proposed a framework that has become known as the investment development path. This proposed that there was a systematic relationship between development and the inward and outward activities of multinational enterprises. This was later extended by a number of collaborative contributions by Rajneesh Narula and John Dunning on FDI and government,Dunning, J.H. and Narula, R. (1996) ‚ÄúForeign Direct Investment and Governments: Catalysts for Economic Restructuring, Routledge, London, 455 pp. and more recently on development and the multinational enterprise.Narula, R. and Dunning, J.H. (2000) ‚ÄúIndustrial Development, Globalization and Multinational Enterprises: New Realities for Developing Countries‚Äù, Oxford Development Studies, Vol. 28 No. 2, pp. 141-67; Narula, R. and Dunning, J.H. ‚ÄúMultinational Enterprises, Development and Globalization: Some Clarifications and a Research Agenda‚Äù, Oxford Development Studies, Vol. 38 No. 3, pp. 263-87 There have been a number of parallel contributions by Nigel Driffield (Aston University), Sanjaya Lall (Oxford University), Hafiz Mirza UNCTAD, Rajah Rasiah (University of Malaya), Nagesh Kumar UNESCAP, Jeremy Clegg (University of Leeds), among others that have further built upon this theme. One of the core insights has been to better understand how learning by firms is motivated by the way in which foreign investors and domestic actors interact, and builds upon internalization theory and the eclectic paradigm. This theme is especially relevant to developing and transition economies, and has inspired a number of important policy studies. Policy Influence The influence of the Reading School extends beyond its contributions to academic research, and into policy-making at the highest levels. This dates back to John Dunning‚Äôs involvement with UNCTAD in 1968 in drafting a report on the extent and pattern of UK direct investment in less developed countries (LDCs). He was appointed in 1972 to the United Nation's Group of Eminent Persons to examine the role of multinational enterprise in economic development and international relations. Dunning acted as Senior Economic Advisor to the Secretary General of the United Nations from 1991-2006. United Nations Dunning was instrumental in establishing the UN‚Äôs annual flagship publication on multinational enterprise ‚Äì the World Investment Report in 1991. This report has become one of the most important UN reports on multinational enterprise and development, and has become a primary reference point for most governments (now published by UNCTAD). Other members of the Reading School have been engaged in advisory and consultancy roles in writing these reports and preparing background materials, including Mark Casson, Rajneesh Narula and Robert Pearce. Similarly, the UNCTAD World Investment Directory represented an extension of the work of John Dunning and John Cantwell, The IRM Directory of Statistics of International Investment and Production, Macmillan, London and New York University Press, New York, 1987, 820pp. Alums and Proponents of the Reading School Many graduates of the Ph.D. program at University of Reading carry on the tradition and approach of the Reading School: Birgitte Andersen (Work Foundation, London), Jeremy Clegg (University of Leeds, UK), Mohamed Azzim Gulamhussen (ISCTE, Lisbon), Nigel Driffield (Aston University, UK), Chie Iguchi (Kieo University, Tokyo), Odile Janne (Birkbeck, University of London, UK), Elena Kosmopoulou (University of Reading), Camilla Noonan (University College Dublin, Ireland), Pavida Pananond (Thammasat University), Marina Papanastassiou (Middlesex University, UK), Robert Read (Lancaster University, UK), Grazia Santangelo (University of Catania, Italy), Teresa da Silva Lopes (University of York, UK), Paz Tolentino (Birkbeck, University of London, UK), Nigel Wadeson (University of Reading) and many others. Currently many influential members of the School have never studied or worked full-time at University of Reading, although many of them visit regularly, e.g. Lorraine Eden (Texas A&M; University, College Station), Niron Hashai (Hebrew University of Jerusalem), Ram Mudambi (Temple University, Philadelphia) and Alain Verbeke (University of Calgary, Canada). Other notable contributors to the Reading School approach are Simona Iammarino (London School of Economics, UK), Satwinder Singh (Brunel University, UK) and Lucia Piscitello (Politecnico di Milano, Italy).

Due to ill-health he did not achieve much that he might have, and his contemporary Sydney Mitchell completed much of his most public works (stealing much of the credit due to Capper). His style cleverly mimics medieval and Renaissance details, and, as it sometimes includes either original or faked medieval date-stones, is regularly accepted as being several centuries older than its true age. In later life he is remembered as Professor Capper due to his academic role at McGill University in Canada. This is often remembered more than for his work in Scotland, and much of his due fame has been laid on the shoulders of his clients and those who completed his works. Early life Born in Douglas, Isle of Man the son of John J. Capper he was raised in Upper Clapton in London until his family moved to Edinburgh when Stewart was nine years old. The family lived at 1 Beaufort Road in the Grange district.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1874 Stewart, and his two brothers, were educated at the Royal High School, where he was dux for the academic year 1874/5. At 16 he then won a place at Edinburgh University and gained a First Class Degree in Classics. The studies included a period attending the University of Heidelberg in Germany, from which it may be concluded that he spoke German competently. Architecture Capper then decided to pursue a life in architecture and received a post in the office of John Burnet & Son in Glasgow in 1884. However, ill-health forced him to abandon this role, and he chose instead to act in the role of personal tutor to the only son of Sir Robert Morier a diplomat in Portugal, also acting as Morier‚Äôs personal secretary. Here he learned both Portuguese and Spanish. After a relatively brief period in this role he moved to Paris to attend the Ecole des Beaux-Arts as a pupil of Jean-Louis Pascal. He stayed here for 4 years of study, during which time he befriended Alexander Nisbet Paterson, Frank Worthington Simon and John Keppie. Following the death of his father and inheritance of the house at 1 Beaufort RoadEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1890, he returned to Edinburgh in 1887 to work as assistant to George Washington Browne where he worked until 1891 whereafter he moved totally to his own practice which he had established in 1888. During this period with Browne he undoubtedly had input into the design of the Central Library on George IV Bridge, the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Wright‚Äôs Buildings on Bruntsfield Place and the Solicitors Buildings on the Cowgate. In his own practice he drew in his old friend from Pascal‚Äôs, Frank Worthington Simon as a partner. Together they quickly came to the attention of the profession, winning a competition for the Hope Chapel in Wigan, and in 1890 Simon exhibited as part of the Edinburgh International Exhibition working with the architect/artist William Alan Carter. The partnership with Simon was brief and dissolved in 1892, and Capper thereafter involved himself closely in the project ideas of Patrick Geddes who sought to make good use of abandoned and derelict properties in Edinburgh‚Äôs Old Town to house students for the \\"Town and Gown University Settlement\\", which although now viewed largely as a philanthropic and conservationist gesture this was primarily as a money-making exercise. This involved Capper hugely extending the previously very small Georgian terrace at Ramsay Gardens to create a hugely picturesque building now an iconic part of Edinburgh‚Äôs townscape. This (although now hard to believe) was done as low-cost student housing but incorporated a house for Geddes himself within it. Sadly Capper‚Äôs ill-health returned during the project and over-seeing of the completion and final detailing was done by Sydney Mitchell who is often incorrectly given credit for the full project. Together with the Ramsay Gardens project Capper also remodelled Riddle‚Äôs Court, James Court and several Lawnmarket blocks as part of the same University Settlement concept. During this period Capper employed Ramsay Traquair as his assistant. Academic life When the Edinburgh College of Art was established in 1892 Capper was one of the initial lecturers in Architecture. In 1896 Capper gave up his overseeing of the various projects passed to him by Geddes. At this stage most were complete other than Ramsay Gardens. Given its enormous prominence in the townscape it was probably reluctantly that he let Mitchell complete his magnum opus. However, Prof Gerard Baldwin Brown had nominated him to be the first Professor of Architecture at McGill University in Montreal. This was also agreed by the principal of McGill, William Peterson. This Capper accepted believing it would improve his health, but the job was conditional upon him ceasing all other jobs, so this alone may have been the reason for him abandoning the Ramsay Gardens project. Capper pushed for architecture to be a university-learnt skill rather than the established practice of being \\"articled\\" to an existing architect to learn the skill. In 1903 he returned to Britain, taking a chair as Professor of Architecture in Victoria University of Manchester. His successor in McGill University, Percy Erskine Hobbs, left McGill in 1909 and Capper expressed an interest in returning, but the position was instead filled, rather ironically, by Capper‚Äôs former assistant, Ramsay Traquair, and Capper continued in Manchester until 1912. Whilst in Canada Capper had served as part-time captain in the Canadian Field Artillery. In Manchester he chose a similar role and rose to brevet major in the Officer Training Corps of the University. His time from 1912 to the outbreak of World War I is unclear but at that point he joined the Manchester Volunteers and was dispatched to Gallipoli. Here though he was declared unfit for service, another reflection on his ill-health. Thereafter he attained a post of Military Censor in Cairo, Egypt, requiring him to learn Arabic. At the end of the war he continued in a similar role in Cairo working for the Ministry of the Interior. He died of a heart attack whilst already in the Anglo-American Hospital in Cairo on 8 January 1925. His funeral was attended by Lord Allenby who was in Cairo at the time and by officials from the Egyptian government but no Scottish friends or family attended, having no time to reach Cairo in the customary 24 hours permitted in Arabic countries between death and funeral. As he was unmarried and had no heir he left his money all to pay additional stipends to teachers at both McGill University and Manchester University.

Sturm Foods Sturm Foods is a subsidiary company that manufactures dry groceries under private label brands and distributes them to the foodservice industry and grocery suppliers throughout the world. Sturm Foods' origin was a dairy farm operation begun in 1905 by Arthur Sturm and his four sons. The boys began buying eggs from local farmers and shipping them to relatives in Chicago for sale there. This small business eventually expanded into other commodities during the 1930s, such as sugar, seed, twine, potatoes, flour, coal and gasoline. World War II helped increase the business, at that point known as A. Sturm & Sons. The company began manufacturing for the first time bulk amounts of dried food products, such as eggs and powdered milk, to be delivered to American servicemen on the battle fronts. The company entered the private label distribution market in the early 1970s and continues this business model to the current day. The business flourished throughout the eighties and nineties with a broadening product line and employment increasing from 150 to 500 employees. In May 2005, Sturm Foods was acquired by the LLC and private equity firm HM Capital Partners. On December 1, 2009, HM Capital announced that Sturm Foods was sold to Treehouse Foods for approximately $660 million. The purchase price was made up of $400m in new debt issuance, $100m in equity stock, with the remainder funded by TreeHouse's existing revolving credit facility. With this purchase, the US soup-to-salad dressings firm made a move to further expand its dry grocery offerings. For the 12 months leading to September 30, 2009, Sturm generated sales of $340m. Following the acquisition, TreeHouse has estimated that it will have pro-forma sales of around $1.9bn and adjusted EBITDA of over $275m. The company also expects the transaction to be more than 16% accretive on an annualised basis following the acquisition, adding $0.38 to $0.40 in earnings per share.  Business model  The company's primary business strategy is to acquire producers of private-label products in Canada and the U.S. It services both the retail grocery and the foodservice distribution channels. In addition to private-brand non-dairy creamers, single-serving coffee pods, baby foods, salad dressings, marinades, dips, soups, sauces, dry-mix pasta dinners, jams, spreads, and cereals, the company also maintains several brand-name products including Cremora non-dairy coffee lightener, Second Nature egg substitutes, and Nature's Goodness baby foods.

He started out as a fast bowler at academy level, but his coach advised him to become a rare left-arm unorthodox spin bowler considering his build, which was ill-suited for fast bowling. He played for India Under-19 cricket team in the 2014 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup where he took a hat- trick against Scotland which brought him into the limelight. He became the second Indian other than Bhuvneshwar Kumar and the third spinner other than Imran Tahir and Ajantha Mendis to take 5-wicket hauls in all three formats. On 18 December 2019, against the West Indies, he became the first bowler for India to take two hat-tricks in international cricket. On 17 January 2020, in the second ODI against Australia, Yadav became the fastest spin bowler for India, in terms of innings, to take 100 wickets in ODI cricket, in his 58th innings. Domestic career Kuldeep Yadav was born and raised in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, the son of a brick kiln owner. In an interview, he revealed that it was his father who wanted him to continue playing cricket and even took him to a coach (Kapil Pandey). Inspired by bowling greats Wasim Akram and Zaheer Khan, he wanted to become a left-arm seamer. However, given his slight build, his coach insisted on him becoming a wrist-spin bowler as he was impressed with the turn and variations he was providing unknowingly at the trials. Since then, he started following and watching videos of Shane Warne's bowling and made him his role model. He also revealed that earlier in his life, there was a dark phase in his life when he thought of giving up cricket and committing suicide, when he was not selected in the Uttar Pradesh‚Äôs under-15 team. He was a member of the Mumbai Indians squad in 2012 and signed up by the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2014, whom he represented at the 2014 Champions League Twenty20. In January 2018, he was bought back by KKR in the 2018 IPL auction for INR 5.8 crores. In the 2019 edition, he played only 9 matches, taking 4 wickets and scoring a total of 12 runs. He broke down during the match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore, at Eden Gardens, because Moeen Ali (RCB) thrashed 3 sixes and 2 fours during his last over. Kuldeep Yadav did not play any further match in the 2019 edition of IPL, after the encounter between RCB and KKR at Eden Gardens. International career On September 21, 2017, he became the third bowler for India to take a hat-trick in an ODI after Chetan Sharma and Kapil Dev. He took a hat-trick at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, against Australia, on 21 September 2017. He was selected in the Indian cricket team to play against West Indies in October 2014 but did not appear in any match. In February 2017 he was added to India's Test squad for their one-off match against Bangladesh. He made his Test debut for India against Australia on 25 March 2017, at the Dharamshala Cricket Stadium, taking four wickets in the first innings. Kuldeep Yadav is the first left-arm wrist spin bowler to represent India national cricket team in Test cricket. He is also only the third such bowler in Test cricket to take four wickets on debut. In June 2017, he was named in India's squad for a limited overs tour to the West Indies. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut for India against the West Indies on 23 June 2017. However, during this game, he was unable to bowl a single delivery as the game ended with no result due to rain during the first innings while India was batting. He was ultimately able to bowl in the next match of the series, where he took three wickets. He made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut for India against the West Indies on 9 July 2017.

Biography Born in Upper Canada, near Detroit, Isaac Messmore grew up in Michigan and later studied law as a young man, graduating from the Richmond Law School in Virginia; he went on to live in La Crosse, Wisconsin, where he practiced law in the 1850s. In 1861, he served in the Wisconsin State Assembly as a Republican. Later in 1861, he was appointed a Wisconsin Circuit Court judge; however, his appointment to the bench was ruled to have been improperly authorized by the governor, and thus invalid.'Proceedings of the State Bar Association of Wisconsin 1903,'Wisconsin Bar Association: 1903, Biographical Sketch of Isaac E. Messmore, pg. 228-231. Messmore next went on to serve in the 31st Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War, attaining the rank of colonel. After the end of the war, Messmore resettled in Washington, D.C., where he was very soon appointed assistant commissioner of the Internal Revenue Bureau. While in Washington, in 1867, he acquired the Meridian Hill estate, an older property which sat a short distance north of the White House; he then subdivided this tract of land, and its lots were sold to create a new neighborhood.Meridian Hill: A History, by Stephen McKevitt (History Press, 2014), pg. 42-45. In the late 1860s, he next served on the Metropolitan Revenue Board of the City of New York, primarily fighting excise-tax fraud. Messmore subsequently moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he purchased and became, in 1881, the editor and publisher of the newspaper The Democrat. He later relocated to Los Angeles, California, about 1888, where he was active in the California Democratic Party. There, in 1894, running for--but losing--the position of Representative from California's 6th congressional district.The San Francisco Call Newspaper, August 23, 1894 (Vol. 76, No. 84) pg. 1.

It premiered on March 30, 2014 on Fox and on March 31, 2014 on National Geographic Channel. The episode presented an in-depth treatment of black holes, beginning with John Michell's suggestion of the existence of an \\"invisible star\\" to the first discovery of a black hole, Cygnus X-1. The episode's title is an allusion to how light from stars and other cosmic objects takes eons to travel to Earth, giving rise to the possibility that we might be viewing objects that no longer exist. The episode received positive reviews, with one critic remarking on how the \\"high level of production value is consistently entertaining and informative.\\" Despite favorable reviews, however, the episode received a 1.5/4 in the 18-49 rating/share demo, with 3.91 million Americans watching it live on Fox, showing a steady decline from the series premiere.  Episode summary  Tyson begins the episode by explaining the nature of the speed of light and how much of what is seen of the observable universe is from light emanated from billions of years ago. Tyson further explains how modern astronomy has used such analysis via deep time to identify the Big Bang event and the age of the universe. Tyson proceeds to describe how the work of Isaac Newton, William Herschel, Michael Faraday, and James Clerk Maxwell contributed to understanding the nature of electromagnetic waves and gravitational force, and how this work led towards Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity, that the speed of light is a fundamental constant of the universe and gravity can be seen as distortion of the fabric of space-time. Tyson describes the concept of dark stars as postulated by John Michell which are not visible but detectable by tracking other stars trapped within their gravity wells, an idea Herschel used to discover binary stars. Tyson then describes the nature of black holes, their enormous gravitational forces that can even capture light, and their discovery via X-ray sources such as Cygnus X-1. Tyson uses the Ship of Imagination to provide a postulate of the warping of spacetime and time dilation as one enters the event horizon of the black hole, and the possibility that these may lead to other points within our universe or others, or even time travel. Tyson ends on noting that Herschel's son, John would be inspired by his father to continue to document the known stars as well as contributions towards photography that play on the same nature of deep time used by astronomers. Animated sequences in this episode feature William and John Herschel; Patrick Stewart provided the voice for William in these segments. Reception The episode's premiere on Fox brought a 1.5/4 in the 18-49 rating/share, with 3.91 million American viewers watching it live. It placed third and last in its timeslot behind Resurrection and Believe; and thirteenth out of eighteenth for the night.

Franchi was engaged for a brief period of time and the death of her fianc√© prompted her to review her life and what her religious convictions were telling her to do; she had been involved in countless charitable works in the past and so dedicated herself to the care of the ill. Her order became tasked with aiding the ill across Como and the smallpox epidemic in 1871 thrust them into action though later claimed Franchi's life sometime later. Franchi's beatification was celebrated on 20 September 2014. Life Giovannina Franchi was born on 24 June 1807 in Como as the second of seven children to the magistrate Giovanni Franchi and Giuseppina Maza; she was born into one of Como's wealthiest families. Her brothers were Antonio and Pietro and Luigi while her sisters were Carolina and Angela and Giuseppa. Her baptism was celebrated on 25 June 1807. Franchi commenced her education in 1814 at the San Carlo boarding school that the Visitation Sisters ran and she was there until 1824. Franchi received her Confirmation on 11 May 1818 and later completed her studies in 1824. In 1840 she became betrothed but her fianc√© (who was an older man) died due to a disease not long after the engagement. In 1842 her childless uncle Carlo Andrea Franchi divided his estate among his nieces and nephews and she received 3000 liras. It was around 1846 that she met for the first time Gian Abbondio Crotti (the Como Cathedral canon) who became her spiritual director and close collaborator. Her mother died in 1849 and her father soon followed in 1852 which came all of a sudden with little warning; her father had bequeathed 32 000 lires to her but was concerned about her unmarried status so had his two sons Antonio and Pietro take care of her. On 27 September 1853 ‚Äì alongside Nina Luigia Allegri and other companions Lucrezia Schiavetti and Anna Maria Poletti ‚Äì she established the Suore Infermiere dell'Addolorata; diocesan approval for the order came later on 25 December 1862 from the Bishop of Como Carlo Marzorati. Her order's mission suffered a slight setback in late 1856 with Crotti's death which forced Franchi to assume greater control and direction of her order. Franchi assumed the religious habit for the first time on 21 November 1858. In 1866 her health began to decline and it was at this time that she drew up her last will in anticipation of her death. Franchi died of smallpox on 23 February 1872 at 5:30am after contracting the disease in the summer of 1871 while tending to victims of the disease; her funeral was celebrated the next morning. Her remains were exhumed in 1935 but were discovered not to have been preserved but rather decomposed. In 2008 her order had 81 religious in nine houses and it had expanded to both Switzerland and Argentina. The order later received the papal decree of praise from Pope Pius XI on 25 January 1935 and official papal approval on 8 June 1942 from Pope Pius XII; the order was aggregated to the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin on 16 July 1942. Beatification The \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against to the cause) was introduced under Pope John Paul II on 18 June 1994; it allowed for the beatification process to commence in Como and titled her as a Servant of God. The diocesan process in Como commenced on 27 September 1994 and closed later on 27 September 1995 before it received the validation needed in Rome from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 18 October 1996. The Positio dossier was compiled and was sent to the C.C.S. in 1998 before historians reviewed and approved it on 3 April 2001. Theologians later approved the dossier's contents on 17 June 2011 as did the C.C.S. members on 6 November 2012. Pope Benedict XVI recognized that Franchi had lived a life of heroic virtue and named her to be Venerable on 20 December 2012. The miracle for beatification was investigated in the diocese of its origin from 27 September 1996 until 23 February 1997 at which stage all documentation from those inquiries were sent to the C.C.S. who validated the process on 7 November 1997. The panel of medical experts approved this healing to be a genuine miracle that science could not explain on 14 February 2013; theologians also approved it on 11 June 2013 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 3 December 2013. Pope Francis approved this miracle attributed to her intercession on 9 December 2013 and announced her beatification to be held on 20 September 2014 in her native Como. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on the pope's behalf. The current postulator for this cause is the Franciscan Giovangiuseppe Califano. The original postulator at the time the cause opened was the Franciscan priest Juan Folguera Trepat.

The agency has two extensive areas of responsibility: promoting Swiss culture and preserving the country‚Äôs cultural heritage. In 2014, its total budget was close to 170 million francs. The FOC promotes culture in the fields of literature, theatre, dance, music, film, the visual arts and design. It helps preserve the cultural heritage by supporting the protection of monuments and archeological research, and it also maintains valuable collections, libraries, archives, and museums. From 2005 to 2013, Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Jauslin was director of the Federal Office of Culture. His successor, as of 1 November 2013, is Isabelle Chassot.  History  The Federal Office of Culture was established in 1975 as a simple administrative service to coordinate cultural activities. The Clottu-Report, commissioned by the Federal Department of Home Affairs and published in the same year, inventoried Switzerland‚Äôs cultural tools and assets and presented proposals for a cultural policy. The report recommended the creation of a new article in the constitution to define the authority of the federal government in the cultural domain. However, it was not until 1999, after a series of difficult referendums and in the context of the total revision of the Federal Constitution that the role of the federal government in arts and culture was inscribed in the constitution (Art 69 FC). To implement this \\"Culture Article\\", as it came to be known, the FOC drafted a Law for the Promotion of Culture. It was adopted by parliament on 11 December 2009, and became effective on 1 January 2012.  Legal principles  The cultural role of the federal government is defined in articles 69, 70, and 71 of the Federal Constitution.Federal Constitution Whereas cultural affairs are generally the responsibility of the cantons (article 1 of the Federal Constitution), the federal government \\"may support cultural efforts of nationwide interest and promote art and music, especially in the field of education\\" (article 69). In doing so the federal government always takes into consideration the \\"cultural and linguistic diversity of the country\\" (article 69). The federal government is responsible for film (article 71) and the preservation and promotion of multilingualism (article 70). In the public interest the federal authorities also preserve and protect \\"landscapes, the overall appearance of towns or villages, historic sites, as well as natural and cultural monuments\\" (article).  Organization  The Federal Office of Culture is divided into two sections which disseminate culture and promote culture, respectively.

It is headquartered in Soufli as part of IV Army Corps.  History  The brigade traces its history to the 50th Infantry Regiment (), which was founded in 1919 in Adrianople (now Edirne in Turkey). The regiment fought in the Greco-Italian War in the Albanian front until the capitulation of the Greek Army following the German invasion of Greece in April 1941. After liberation, the regiment was reformed, initially for a short period as the 32nd Brigade (32Œ∑ Œ§Œ±ŒæŒπŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±), and stationed at Eleftheroupoli. Between 1964 and 1988 it moved its base from Eleftheroupoli to Feres, Pythio, again to Eleftheroupoli and then briefly to Koufovouno. In summer 1988 it was transferred to Soufli, where its expansion to brigade began. The 50th Infantry Brigade (50ŒÆ Œ§Œ±ŒæŒπŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ± Œ†ŒµŒ∂ŒπŒ∫Œøœç) became operational on 1 October 1988, although its formation was not completed until two years later.

Description Peters Hill sits atop a north-south ridge about west of the surveyed town of Hamilton and around nearly due east of the town of Riverton. The surrounding country supports grazing on the higher peaks and dry grain farming on the slopes and plains. Naming Peters Hill has been named as such since as early as 1842. It may have been named after William Peter, a Scottish grazier who in 1841 pioneered European settlement in this district. His sheep runs extended all round this hill, one of his head stations being nearby. \\"Peter's Hill\\" is shown on the western ridge of an 1842 plan of the Light River valley. \\"Mr Peter's Head Station\\" is shown on the eastern slopes of the valley. named on a survey plan drawn up in 1842 for the Secondary Towns Association. Other history sources have suggested alternative origins for the name. Among these are the Manning Index. This identifies three sources for the hill's name. One is William Spence Peter, as already mentioned. Another asserts it was named after ‚ÄúPeter Inkster (c.1829-1917), an early settler.‚Äù, However, Inkster's obituary said that he did not migrate to South Australia until later, by which time the name had been in use for some time. Lastly, it may have been named \\"Petatz Hill\\" after Martin Petatz, a Wendish settler who owned a nearby property. However, Petatz‚Äôs name is not recorded in official records as a landholder.

R. Ambedkar on 20 March 1927 to allow untouchables to use water in a public tank in Mahad (currently in Raigad district), Maharashtra, India. The day (20 March) is observed as Social Empowerment day in India.  Background  Bronze sculpture depicting Mahad movement by B R Ambedkar By the Indian caste system, untouchables (Dalits) were segregated from the other Hindu castes. They were banned from using water bodies and roads which were used by other Hindu castes. In August 1923, Bombay Legislative Council passed a resolution that people from the depressed classes should be allowed to use places which were built and maintained by the Government. In January 1924, Mahad which was part of the Bombay Province passed the resolution in its municipal council to enforce the act. But it was failed to implement because of the protest from the savarna Hindus.  Satyagraha  Flyer published before Mahad Satyagraha in 1927 In 1927, Ambedkar decided to launch a satyagraha (nonviolent resistance) to assert their rights to use water in the public places. Mahad, a town in Konkan, was selected for the event because it had a nucleus of support from 'caste hindus'. These included A.V.Chitre, an activist from the Marathi Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu (CKP) community; G.N.Sahasrabudhe, a Chitpawan Brahmin of the Social Service League and Surendranath Tipnis, a CKP who was president of the Mahad municipality. Surendranath Tipnis, the president of the Mahad municipality declared its public spaces open to untouchables and invited Ambedkar to hold a meeting at Mahad in 1927. After the meeting, they proceeded to the 'Chowder tank'. Ambedkar drank water from the tank and thousands of untouchables followed him. Ambedkar also made a statement addressing the Dalit women during the Satyagraha. He asked them to abandon all old customs that provided recognizable markers of untouchability and asked them to wear saris like high caste women. Before that time, the Dalit women were not allowed to drape saris completely. Immediately after Ambedkar's speech at Mahad, the dalit women readily decided to drape their saris like the higher caste women. 'Radical' upper caste women namely Lakshmibai Tipnis and Indirabia Chitre helped the Dalit women dress like 'upper caste women' by covering the legs of the dalit women down to their ankles. A riot broke out following a rumour that Ambedkar and his followers were planning to enter a Hindu temple in the town. And the caste Hindu argued that untouchables polluted the tank by taking water from it. To purify the tank cow-urine and cow-dung were used. 108 pots containing a mixture of these products were emptied into the tank while Brahmins recited mantras. The tank was then declared fit for upper caste hindu consumption. Ambedkar decided to hold the second conference in Mahad on 26‚Äì27 December 1927. But caste Hindus filed a case against him that tank as a private property. He was not able to continue his satyagraha as the case was sub judice. On 25 December (Manusmriti Dahan Din), Shastrabuddhe under the guidance of Ambedkar, burnt Manusmriti, a Hindu law book, as a protest. In December 1937, the Bombay High Court ruled that untouchables have the right to use water from the tank. Struggle to access water by Dalit still continues. Access to water is still denied to Dalits at many places and are beaten or killed many times if they try to drink water from the forbidden places. On 19th March 1940, Dr. Ambedkar arranged a rally and public conference in Mahad to recollect 14th Mahad Satyagraha Day as \\"Empowerment Day\\". On this day,Adv. Vishnu Narhari Khodke, as President of Mahad Municipal Corporation, arranged a function and honoured Dr. Ambedkar with a Letter of Honour (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§∞) for his \\"Chavdar tale Satyagraha\\" and \\"Manusmruti Dahan\\" and other movements in Mahad.  Poems  There were many poems of struggle. Following poem is written by Arjun Dangle, one of the founding members of the Dalit Panther Party.

Career Sampy was playing for local side Chopwell Colliery when he was signed by league side Sheffield United in May 1921. United paid ¬£250 for the services of Sampy and teammate Jimmy Waugh, but whereas Waugh went on to become a regular in the first team, Sampy was largely seen as a reserve and did not make his league debut until October 1924 in an away match against Bury. Occasionally featuring in the league from that point on, Sampy did not get a consistent run in the side until the 1925‚Äì26 season. In March 1927 Sampy was signed by Swansea Town for ¬£500 but spent much of his three seasons there in the reserves, making only 41 league appearances. In the summer of 1930 Sampy was granted a free transfer and joined Waterford in Ireland, initially as a player and then as player-manager from 1931. Returning to England, Sampy then joined non-league Nelson with whom he spent one season. Personal life Born in Backworth, Tyne and Wear, Bill Sampy was the younger brother of fellow Sheffield United player Tommy Sampy, although the two only played together on very rare occasions.

The band consists of Joe Casey (vocals), Greg Ahee (guitar), Alex Leonard (drums), and Scott Davidson (bass). To date, the band has released five studio albums: No Passion All Technique (2012), Under Color of Official Right (2014), The Agent Intellect (2015), Relatives in Descent (2017), and Ultimate Success Today (2020) History Prior to Protomartyr, Greg Ahee and Alex Leonard performed as a duo under the name Butt Babies. They later started playing with Joe Casey as Protomartyr. Kevin Boyer of Tyvek played bass and guitar in the band for a short time. In 2010, Scott Davidson joined on bass. The band released their debut album, No Passion All Technique in 2012 via Urinal Cake Records. This was followed by the single \\"Colpi Proibiti\\" in the same year, via X! Records. Their second studio album, Under Color of Official Right, was released in April 2014 via the Hardly Art record label. A third studio album, The Agent Intellect, followed in October 2015. The album was critically acclaimed, achieving an 85/100 on accumulator website Metacritic, and featured in best of 2015 lists in The A.V. Club, Chicago Tribune, Rolling Stone, Metacritic, Spin, and Consequence of Sound. Protomartyr signed to Domino Records in 2017, and released their fourth studio album, Relatives in Descent, on the label in September 2017. The group's fifth album, Ultimate Success Today, was originally scheduled to follow in May 2020, but was subsequently postponed to that July due to the 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus pandemic. Kelley Deal, who had appeared on the band's 2018 EP Consolation, appeared as a special guest at the first three shows of the 2020 tour, though it is currently unknown if she will remain as a touring member when live performances resume. Musical style Protomartyr's music has been labeled as post-punk and punk rock. Josh Terry of Consequence of Sound stated that the band \\"blends the moody atmospherics of ‚Äò70s U.K. post-punk with the raw sensibility of their Motor City garage-rock forebears.\\" The band's sound was compared to other post-punk acts such as Wire, the Fall, Pere Ubu, the Constantines and Iceage, as well as local acts, most notably Tyvek. Vocalist Joe Casey also expressed appreciation for Pere Ubu and the Fall. His baritone vocals have been compared to Ian Curtis of Joy Division, Mark E. Smith of the Fall, and Nick Cave.  Influence  Protomartyr have been cited as an influence by bands such as Shame, Idles, Priests, The Dirty Nil, Vundabar, Meat Wave, Rendez-Vous, Dehd and The Devil Wears Prada. In addition, notable fans of the band include The Dirty Nil, Metz, Cloud Nothings, Eternal Summers, FRIGS, Fontaines D.C., Bully, Parquet Courts, Kelley Deal, Greg Dulli, Billy Gould, Ana da Silva, and Iggy Pop - who called them \\"the best band we‚Äôve got in America right now\\". In an interview with Beats Per Minute in August 2020, Casey revealed that the lyric \\"shouted slogans of leapers\\" from the track \\"The Aphorist\\" off of Ultimate Success Today is a reference to \\"the young bands [that] I feel are attacking us and doing a shitty job at it, or a watered down version of us.

He migrated with Umar ibn Khattab. Abu Jahl decided to take him back. So he made a false story of Ayyash's mother's illness. Abu Jahl went to Madinah with his brother Harith and told Ayyash that his mother was ill and she had taken an oath that she would not sit in shed and would not comb before she see Ayyash's face. Umar warned Ayyash not to go. But Ayyash was so emotional that he became strongly determined. Then Umar gave his own healthy camel to Ayyash for escape if needed.

Location Karanpura is located on Nohar-Bhadra road near Bhadra city of Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan, India. Administrationally Karanpura is in Bhadra tehsil of Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan. It is 8 km in the west from Bhadra and 125 km in the south-east from district headquarters Hanumangarh. Other famous Harappan site of this district Kalibangan is about 120 km in the west from Karanpura. Excavation The excavation was done by a team under archeologist V N Prbhakar, archeological department of India, New Delhi. The archeologists have found pottery and articles of Harappan period. Excavations discovered many mud brick houses from early Harappan(3300-2600 BCE) to mature Harappan (2600-1900 BCE) periods. Within the site, Harappan pottery, terracotta bangles, grinding stone fragments, beads of agate, and a terracotta figurine have been excavated. Using the artifacts discovered at the site, trade routes have been linked that reach as far as Afghanistan during the Harappan civilization. Despite being small in size compared to other Harappan sites, the ancient city was a major long-distance trading hub. Within the site, a rare discovery of 4 complete rhino bones was found, suggesting that the surrounding area was inhabitable with rhino. A copper mirror was also found at the site, a rarity in Harappan culture, but more evidence of their extensive trading. Pottery preceding Harappan culture has also been found within the site. Continuous findings within the site for up to 3 meters suggest a continuous occupation roughly since 2800 BCE. Early Harappan findings of copper and lapis lazuli indicate long-standing acquisition and trade of raw materials up to the mature Harappan period. Steatite seals and an abundance of graffiti was also discovered within the mature Harappan portion of the site. Terracota like pottery and bangles which are similar with findings at other Harappan sites were found. On January 2013 a skeleton of child has been found. Seals similar to other Harppan sites also has been found in 2013‚Äì2014.

Description and history The Clymer House is located in a rural setting north of the village center of Harrisville, on the north side of Clymer Road, a short stub road extending east from Tolman Pond Road. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It is set on the stone foundation of an older house. The main facade is three bays wide, and faces west, toward a central barnyard surrounded by a cluster of outbuildings. It has sash windows on either side of a center entrance, which is flanked by sidelight windows. The door and windows both butt against the roof eave, a clear echo of how these types of houses were built in the 18th century. The interior is little altered since its construction, and includes a fireplace with paneled surround. The house was built in 1932, and is a rare local example of a well- preserved Colonial Revival cottage. The accompanying barn is also from that period, and is like the house built on an old foundation. Other period elements of the property include a garage with batten siding and a small guesthouse.

Retrieved 31 March 2014. . was a British commercial artist who, in a career of over 50 years, was responsible for over 1000 cinema poster designs. Early career His career began in 1940 when Pulford, who was then doing freelance engineering illustration, began painting posters for Rank cinemas in the Leeds area. His work included Gaslight, The Bluebird, and Thief Of Baghdad. In 1943 he was asked by Rank to set up a design studio in London and Pulford Publicity was established, funded by Downton Advertising, a Fleet Street agency connected with Rank. One of the first employees was the lettering artist Tom Brownlow. In the early years, Pulford did most of the design and painting himself. Early examples are Henry V (1944), Odd Man Out (1946) and Oliver Twist (1948). 1950s & 60s Africa Fly There by BOAC poster by Eric Pulford, c. 1959. From the 1950s Pulford began to concentrate more on design with other illustrators producing the art work. Pulford Publicity bought a controlling interest in Downtons in the early 1960s and, as Downtons, became Britain's premier film advertising agency. Clients included Rank who owned the Gaumont and Odeon cinema chains, British Lion, Universal, United Artists and RKO. In 1965 Downtons merged with the Dixons agency, adding Columbia and Disney, and later Avco-Embassy and Brent Walker, to its portfolio of clients. One of Pulford's innovations was to bring talented your Italian artists to London. One was Renato Fratini in 1958, who became one of the most important artists working for Downton.An interview with Sim Branaghan, author of British Film Posters: An Illustrated History Film on Paper, 10 February 2012. Retrieved 30 March 2014. Archived here. Among the important Rank films for which Pulford designed the poster were the later Norman Wisdom comedies, the \\"Doctor\\" films, and the Carry On series. He sometimes visited the sets of films in production and was lucky enough to attend the filming of the chariot race in Rome for the 1959 epic Ben Hur. 1970s and 80s In 1973 Pulford won an award for his design for the poster of Disney's The Island at the Top of the World (1973). By the end of his career Pulford was mainly supervising others and designing posters but not preparing the artwork. He continued to produce some finished works, however, including Stranger In The House (1967), The Lady Vanishes (1979), and Breathless (1983). The last complete poster that he produced was for The Evil that Men Do (1984), starring Charles Bronson. He retired in 1984. Other work Cinema posters were the mainstay for Pulford and Downtons, but amongst the other work completed were airline travel posters for BOAC.

Built about 1816 and enlarged later in the 19th century, it is a picturesque example of the adaptation of an older farm property for use as a summer estate. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Corey Farm is located in a rural location of central Dublin, east of Mount Monadnock, down a winding lane off the end of Parsons Road. It is a rambling 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a clipped gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The roof is pierced on its front and rear faces by a variety of gable- and hip-roof dormers. Windows are of differing dimensions and somewhat random placement, and a single-story gabled ell extends to the right. The left rear corner has two levels of porches. The oldest portion of this rambling 2.5 story wood frame house was built c. 1816 by Moses Corey, a farmer, on land purchased from his father-in-law. Corey was prominent in local affairs, serving on the board of selectmen and the school committee. He sold the farm in 1850. Mrs. William Parsons purchased the property in 1889, and began its transformation into a gentleman's farm, part of a larger complex of properties owned by that family. This house was occupied by her daughter, artist Georgianna Parsons (who later built the nearby Parsons Studio and Casino). A 20th-century owner of the property was Ernest J. Simmons, a professor of Slavic Languages at Columbia University.

This three- story brick building, built in 1837, is the only building with a clerestory roof in Hinsdale, and one of only four in the state. It is also distinctive as the only known example in the state of a building purpose-built as a large- scale cooperage. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The former Holman & Merriman Machine Shop is located on the eastern fringe of the village of Hinsdale, on the north side of Canal Street (New Hampshire Route 119). It is set close to the road, and was historically flanked to the north by an industrial power canal, since filled in. It is built into a granite ledge, presenting three stories to the street and two to the back. It is built of brick, with granite trim, and a gabled roof that has a row of clerestory windows midway between the ridge and cornice. The main facade is eight bays wide, with the entrance in one of the central bays. A shed-roof wood frame ell extends to the left. The shop was built in 1837 by Joel Derby, for use as a cooperage, and was sited to take advantage of the water power provided by the canal (opened in 1828). In its basement, the wheel pit and tail race survive from its period of water-powered use. The building's clerestory windows provided ample natural light, and were a building technique that enabled the construction of larger industrial buildings prior to the introduction of artificial lighting. Only three other clerestory roofs are known to survive in the state. The building saw a variety of industrial uses until 1991, including manufacturers of pails, sewing machines, and industrial mill parts. It was also here that George Long, a resident of nearby Northfield, Massachusetts, built a vehicle propelled by a coal-fired steam engine.

Life  The son of a wealthy Vlach family, he was born in 1799 in the village of Veternikon (mod. Neraidochori) in western Thessaly. He initially followed his family's trade, spending time as a merchant in Serres, Salonica and Vienna. In 1819 he became a member of the Filiki Etaireia. When the Greek War of Independence broke out in 1821 he immediately joined the rebels' ranks, and alongside Nikolaos Stournaras scored a number of early successes against the Ottoman forces in Thessaly. Hatzipetros served throughout the war, serving both in Central Greece and the Peloponnese under Kitsos Tzavellas and Georgios Karaiskakis, fighting with particular distinction in the battles of Neokastron and Arachova. Under Ioannis Kapodistrias, he was named a chiliarch, and under King Otto of Greece commander of the Royal Phalanx (a corps of veteran fighters of the War of Independence) of Eastern Greece. Eventually, he rose to the rank of Major General and the post of aide-de-camp to Otto, but his inveterate womanizing led him to become involved in several sexual scandals (such as his notorious affair with Jane Digby) and caused him trouble with Queen Amalia, who demanded his dismissal from the court. In 1854, during the Crimean War, while Greece was officially neutral, he was charged with leading the invasion of Ottoman-ruled Thessaly at the head of irregular forces. Despite early successes, he was defeated and nearly captured by the Ottoman army near Kalambaka. He then continued to lead a guerrilla in the region until the occupation of Piraeus by the British and French forced the Greek government to recall its forces. Hatzipetros remained aide-de-camp to Otto until the latter's ouster in 1862, and was then made honorary aide-de-camp to the new king, George I, until his death on 29 October 1869 (O.S.).
