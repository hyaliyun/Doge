Life  Natalia Doco was born in Buenos Aires on 6 September 1982. She began to make herself known by performing and singing in bars. In 2004, Natalia Doco was a candidate on the program Operaci√≥n Triunfo, the Argentine version of Star Academy. Due to little success and bad experience on the show, she left for several years in Mexico (five or six years) to step back, and to learn the profession of singer, by performing in clubs or popular festivals, where she performs both traditional and popular songs. She made a trip to Europe in 2011, and decided to settle in Paris after meeting Florian Delavega, with whom she formed a relationship. In May 2014, she released an EP, Freezing, then in June her first album, Mucho Chino. Sung in Spanish and English, this album includes three covers: Et Pourtant by Charles Aznavour, And I Love Her by the Beatles and La Celestina by Lhasa de Sela. Her single Respira was released in June 2015. She performed as the warm up act for several artists, including Gilberto Gil. Also in 2014, Imany used her as one of the voices of the soundtrack of Audrey Dana's film Under the skirts of girls. Imany then invited her to participate in concerts organized for the fight against endometriosis in 2015, and 2016. In spite of some success, she thought that her first album does not reflect her style enough, and created her own label alongside her manager and her companion. For her new project, she contacted Argentinian musician Axel Krygier. After a remote collaboration, Natalia Doco leaves to record her second album, in Argentina in October 2015. Entitled El Buen Gualicho, sung in Spanish and French, this album was released in September 2017. El Buen Gualicho received in particular positive reviews in Le Monde and Madmoizelle. Announcing the release of this album on Instagram, she also publicly revealed her pregnancy. In January 2018, Natalia announced she had given birth to a boy.

Early life Ventura was the son of a military veteran of the war in Morocco (1912), and grandson of the military of the war in Cuba (1878). Ventura was born in Madrid to a prominent family of distinguished farmers. His ancestor, and grandfather graduated as an agronomist at the University of Salamanca. Encouraged by his father, he wanted to join the army in 1926, but since he could not do it because he was not old enough to study, he had to do it as a cornet. In 1928 he entered the Infantry Academy of NCOs. With the rank of sergeant, he was assigned to the 1st Infantry Regiment. In 1931, by changing the regimes and leaving the king Alfonso XIII of Spain the country, he swears the flag and the new constitution. As a military man eager to ascend soon he went to the internal study of officers in the infantry weapon to close Manuel Aza√±a Toledo's academy, leaving in his second lieutenant promotion out of his studies that will reach as a lieutenant. He was promoted to Lieutenant on February 25, 1934.  Spanish Civil War  When the Civil War started (July 1936), as a soldier of the Spanish Republican Army Monge - a devout CatholicGraham, Helen.

So when the conflict broke out his loyalty was totally unquestionable towards his boss, remaining loyal to the Republican government and was appointed Minister of War. On December 1936 he was promoted to the rank of captain. Through the efforts he put in his forces, fighting in the defense of the capital of Spain, demonstrating its value in the defenses of Madrid, Morata de Taju√±a, and Arganda he was designated head of his battalion of the Forces of Defense commanded by General Jose Miaja, with Vicente Rojo Lluch as chief-of-staff. Preston, Paul. The Spanish Civil War. Reaction, revolution & revenge. Harper Perennial. London 2006. During the rapprochement of the fascists in the vicinity of Madrid, the people of Madrid turned to the defense, some new forces were also created and they were used to plug holes in all the useful forces, the 66 mixed brigade that was in training and the they form some components of the fifth regiment and the steel column, they will fight in this battle. The head of the Madrid Defense Board was created to defend the capital at all costs after the transfer of the Republican government from Madrid to Valencia. In this capacity I have fought to win their new chevrons in coordination of an effective defense plan for the city that prevented its fall designed by Vicente Rojo. Jackson, Gabriel.

In December 1936 he was appointed commander of the newly created 66th Mixed Brigade.2 He led this unit in the battle of Jarama, and later in heavy fighting in the area of Esplegares (Guadalajara). According to Carlos Engel, he would also have commanded the 56th Mixed Brigade, reserve unit of the Army of Extremadura.3 In the spring of 1938 he was appointed commander of the 63rd Mixed Brigade, acting on the Levante front and in the Extremadura front; the unit sustained heavy fighting on both fronts.4 On the Extremadura front the 63rd mixed brigade participated in various operations during the year 1938. On April 5, its 250th Battalion attacked Carrascalejo prematurely, which it managed to conquer, but lost it on the 8th due to a nationalist counterattack. As a result of this operation, his boss, Major Blas, was dismissed, and replaced by Joaqu√≠n P√©rez Mart√≠n-Parapar, the eldest of the militias. The 56th Mixed Brigade was formed in January 1937, in the sub-sector of Almer√≠a, under the command of the Joaqu√≠n P√©rez Mart√≠n de Parapar major. Eventually, he led the 66 Mixed Brigade in the Jarama. In December 1937, it became part of the reserve of the Army of Extremadura and was dissolved in April 1938, changing the largest unit. At the beginning of May, he left for the Levante front, joining the 48th Division of the XVI Army Corps and heading to Segorbe.

On December 15, he was appointed to cover the passive front of Hinojosa del Duque, in which he remained successful during the battle of Pe√±arroya and stayed there until the end of the war. Captured by the Francoists at the end of the war, as they always did to the one who had successfully confronted them, he was decreed guilty of rebellion armed with the maximum penalty, the execution in the city of Guadalajara in early 1941.

Doty was sentenced to death after he pleaded guilty to killing a fellow inmate he stabbed and strangled to death while he was serving a life sentence for the fatal shooting of a night watchman at a Plant City manufacturing plant during a drug robbery in 1996. Doty landed on death row after killing inmate Xavier Rodriguez, in 2011. Death sentence Wayne Doty was first sentenced to death on June 5, 2013; that sentence was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court in July 2013. Once Doty's case went back to the trial court that sentenced him for post-conviction appeals, he initially asked the lower court to dismiss his attorney and waive all his appeals. However, in 2016, the United States Supreme Court in Hurst v. Florida declared Florida's capital sentencing laws unconstitutional. The old law called for a majority vote of the jury to sentence a defendant to death. The new law calls for a unanimous jury vote of death in order to sentence a defendant to death. In 2016, Mr. Doty's first death sentence was thrown out. He was retried in 2018, and the jury unanimously voted to sentence him again on May 15. Doty was the only inmate on Florida's death row who has chosen the electric chair over lethal injection as the preferred method of execution.

A number of websites, for example social media websites, offer account verification services. Verified accounts are often visually distinguished by check mark icons or badges next to the names of individuals or organizations. Account verification can enhance the quality of online services, mitigating sockpuppetry, bots, trolling, spam, vandalism, fake news, disinformation and election interference.  History  Account verification was initially a feature for public figures and accounts of interest, individuals in \\"music, acting, fashion, government, politics, religion, journalism, media, sports, business and other key interest areas\\". It was introduced by Twitter in June 2009, followed by Google+ in 2011, Facebook in 2012, Instagram in 2014, and Pinterest in 2015. On YouTube, users are able to submit a request for a verification badge once they obtain 100,000 or more subscribers. It also has an \\"official artist\\" badge for musicians and bands. In July 2016, Twitter announced that, beyond public figures, any individual would be able to apply for account verification. This was temporarily suspended in February 2018, following a backlash over the verification of one of the organisers of the far-right Unite the Right rally due to a perception that verification conveys \\"credibility\\" or \\"importance\\". In March 2018, during a live-stream on Periscope, Jack Dorsey, co-founder and CEO of Twitter, discussed the idea of allowing any individual to get a verified account. Instagram began allowing users to request verification in August 2018. In April 2018, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of Facebook, announced that purchasers of political or issue-based advertisements would be required to verify their identities and locations. He also indicated that Facebook would require individuals who manage large pages to be verified. In May 2018, Kent Walker, senior vice president of Google, announced that, in the United States, purchasers of political-leaning advertisements would need to verify their identities.  Techniques  = Identity verification services = Identity verification services are third-party solutions which can be used to ensure that a person provides information which is associated with the identity of a real person. Such services may verify the authenticity of identity documents such as drivers licenses or passports, called documentary verification, or may verify identity information against authoritative sources such as credit bureaus or government data, called non-documentary verification. = Identity documents verification = The uploading of scanned or photographed identity documents is a practice in use, for example at Facebook. According to Facebook, there are two reasons that a person would be asked to send a scan of or photograph of an ID to Facebook: to show account ownership and to confirm their name. In January 2018, Facebook purchased Confirm.io, a startup that was advancing technologies to verify the authenticity of identification documentation. = Biometric verification = = Behavioral verification = Behavioral verification is the computer-aided and automated detection and analysis of behaviors and patterns of behavior to verify accounts. Behaviors to detect include those of sockpuppets, bots, cyborgs, trolls, spammers, vandals, and sources and spreaders of fake news, disinformation and election interference. Behavioral verification processes can flag accounts as suspicious, exclude accounts from suspicion, or offer corroborating evidence for processes of account verification. = Bank account verification = Identity verification is required to establish bank accounts and other financial accounts in many jurisdictions. Verifying identity in the financial sector is often required by regulation such as Know Your Customer or Customer Identification Program. Accordingly, bank accounts can be of use as corroborating evidence when performing account verification.

For most Spanish variables rate mortgages, the interest rate payable is calculated by reference rate to Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) . If interest reference increases, then the interest on the mortgage also increases, likewise, if EURIBOR decreases, then interest payments will fall. However, the insertion of the floor clause into the mortgage agreement means that mortgage holders do not fully benefit from the fall in EURIBOR as there will be a minimum rate of interest payable on the mortgage (also known as a \\"suelo\\". The level of the floor will depend in the bank providing the mortgage and when the mortgage was taken out, but it is typical see floors of 3- 4%. This clause has been deemed by both the Spanish and European courts to be illegal, and unfair and constitute ‚Äòabusive‚Äô practice. It is estimated that there are more than 3.5 million mortgages affected. The main banks affected are Banco Popular, Unicaja and Banco de Sabadell.  Courts rule against floor clauses  = Spanish Supreme Court Resolution on 9 May 2013= The Supreme Court ruled Floor Clauses were null and void as abusive, among other reasons due to their lack of transparency. It is understood that there has been transparency if the information was clear and the client had the ability to understand its contents and consequences. The judgment contained an injunction that obligated to withdrawal floor clauses from some mortgages loan agreements and pay a redress to the clients for the overpaid amounts only from the date of the sentence. The main banks affected for this sentences were BBVA (400,000 mortgages), Novagalicia Banco (90,000 mortgages) and CajaMar (100,000). This sentence set down case law for future claims. However, it opened a long legal battle to get a full refund for the overpaid amounts since the outset of the mortgage loan. That is because the limitation of the retroactivity to the sentence's date redress goes against the Spanish Civil Code. =Spanish Supreme Court Resolution on 21 December 2016 = The European Court of Justice ruled in favour of the customer and against the limitation of the retroactivity in a Prejudicial Question on 21 December 2016. That means that the European Court of Justice set out that the bank should return all overpaid amounts from the outset of the mortgage. Current Situation =Royal-Decree Law 1/2017 of 20 January, about urgent measures to protect consumers in Floor clause matters.= The Spanish Government passed a new legislation on 20 January to set a pre-judicial process to claim for the overpaid amounts. According to the Royal-Decree Law, the affected customers can lodge a complaint to the bank to claim for the overpaid amounts due to the floor clause. Once the client has submitted the claim, the bank has up to three months to accept the complaint and return the overpaid amount. If the bank rejects the claim, the client can bring actions to the court to claim for the overpaid amounts. This process is not mandatory for the customers and its can take actions to the court directly. Only 37.5% of the affected customers have reached an agreement to the bank throughout this system. However, according to the General Council of the Judiciary, 98.3% of judicial sentences about floor clauses are in favour of the client. Additionally, there are some regions where all judicial resolutions has been ruled in favour of the client, among those Malaga, Murcia, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Barcelona.

It is located approximately northwest of Wolverley and the same distance southwest of Blakeshall. Geography and history  During the Iron Age, Drakelow was the location of a small multivallate hillfort which stood on a promontory known as Drakelow Hill.Historic England (retrieved 14 August 2018) The name 'Drakelow', meaning 'Dragon's Mound', is of Anglo-Saxon origin, the locality having been well settled by that time. The name appeared in a document in 1240 as 'Brakelowe', but the present spelling was used in a Will in 1582. In the nineteenth century William Hancocks, owner of the Blakeshall Estate, built a 'Swiss' style village on the sandstone hills above Drakelow. During the Second World War the Drakelow Tunnels shadow factory was built on the old village site, and subsequently developed during the Cold War to be a fall-back government centre. The main entrance to the Tunnels during wartime was on the land behind Baxter Cottage, seen in the photograph. The sandstone hills at Drakelow had a number of rock houses similar to those on nearby Kinver Edge.Wyre Forest District Official Guide 1983/84, copy held by Kidderminster Public Library The remains of some of these rock houses may be seen from the path leading east from Baxter Cottage.

It is currently located at the Yapƒ± Kredi Culture Center on ƒ∞stiklal Avenue. One of Istanbul's most well-known sculptures, it is a figure of a woman with open arms formed out of 112 equally spaced -thick sheet metal strips. When the sculptor attempted to explain the feeling of a human hug, he thought of the Mediterranean Sea, which he said was the reason behind the name Akdeniz, the Turkish name of the Mediterranean. The sculpture's design, which is based on a paper cutting and folding technique, weighs 4.5 tonnes. In 1981, the sculpture earned ƒ∞lhan Koman the Sedat Simavi Foundation Visual Arts Award. The sculpture, which was requested by the insurance company Halk Sigorta (later renamed as Yapƒ± Kredi Sigorta), was initially erected in front of the company's headquarters on B√ºy√ºkdere Avenue in Levent. In 2005, the sculpture was temporarily moved to Galatasaray Square for ƒ∞lhan Koman's exhibition; and some time later, with Halk Sigorta transferring to Yapƒ± Kredi Sigorta, was placed in front of the Yapƒ± Kredi Bank Headquarters in Levent. People protesting Israel's invasion of the Gaza Strip during the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict ravaged the sculpture, which was situated next to the Israeli Consulate in Levent, Istanbul. After these events, the residents of Edirne started a petition to bring the sculpture to their city; while Antalya's Muratpa≈üa district also wanted to house the sculpture in their district.

At first it formed part of the 2nd Administrative Battalion, but on 1 February 1862 it moved to a new 4th Administrative Battalion, Durham RVCs, which had its headquarters (HQ) at Stockton and including the following units:Westlake, pp. 74‚Äì8.Becket, Appendix VII.Frederick, pp. 144‚Äì5.Army List, various dates. * 1st (Stockton) Durham RVC * 15th (Darlington) Durham RVC, formed 6 October 1860 * 16th (Castle Eden) Durham RVC, formed 14 December 1860 * 19th (Hartlepool) Durham RVC, formed 26 January 1861, disbanded November 1872 * 7th (Teesdale Volunteers) Yorkshire North Riding RVC, formed at Startforth 29 February 1860, joined the 4th Admin Battalion of Durham RVCs in December 1863, but converted in January 1864 into 21st Durham RVC in 2nd Admin Battalion.Westlake, p. 256. * 21st (Middlesbrough) Yorkshire North Riding RVC, formed as two companies on 13 October 1877 and joined the 4th Admin Battalion of Durham RVCs.Westlake, p. 258. The Stockton Volunteers had a band that competed in regional brass band competitions from 1867 to 1898.1st Durham Rifle Volunteers (Stockton) at Brass Band Results. Under the scheme of 'localisation' introduced by the Cardwell Reforms in 1873, the Durham RVCs, together with the Durham Militia and the two Regular battalions (68th Light Infantry and 106th Light Infantry) that later formed the Durham Light Infantry (DLI), constituted Brigade No 3, based at Sunderland in the Durham sub-district of Northern District. While the sub- districts were referred to as 'brigades', they were purely administrative organisations and the Volunteers were excluded from the 'mobilisation' part of the Cardwell system, though they carried out joint manoeuvres.Training Depots, 1873‚Äì1881 at Regiments.org. The Teesside industrialist Samuel Sadler was appointed Commanding Officer (CO) of the battalion with the rank of lieutenant-colonel on 16 August 1876. When the Rifle Volunteer units were consolidated on 16 March 1880, the 4th Durham Admin Battalion became the new 1st Durham (1st Durham and North Riding of York) RVC, with the following composition: * A, B, & C Companies (former 1st Durham RVC) * D & E Companies (former 15th Durham RVC) * F Company (former 16th Durham RVC) * G & H Companies (former 21st North Riding RVC) After the Childers Reforms the RVCs became Volunteer Battalions of their affiliated Regular Army regiment on 1 July 1881, and the 1st Durham RVC formally changed its title to 1st Volunteer Battalion, Durham Light Infantry on 1 December 1887. It already wore the same red coat with white facings as the DLI. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 proposed a more comprehensive Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì6.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì1. Under this scheme the Volunteer Battalions of the DLI and the Northumberland Fusiliers formed the Tyne and Tees Brigade until a separate Durham Light Infantry Brigade was formed in 1902. In 1900 the battalion raised further companies: * I Company at Stockton * K Company at Darlington * L Company at Middlesbrough * M (Cyclist) Company at Stockton The 1st VB contributed detachments to three successive service companies who served alongside the Regular DLI in the Second Boer War, which gained the battalion its first battle honour: South Africa 1900‚Äì1902.Dunn, pp. 12‚Äì3.Leslie. Territorial Force DLI cap badge (1902‚Äì53 version) When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 1st VB became 5th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry. Unlike the rest of the DLI battalions of the TF, which continued as the Durham Light Infantry Brigade, the 5th Bn in south Durham joined the York and Durham Brigade in the TF's Northumbrian Division.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 993‚Äì100.James, p. 100‚Äì1.50 Division at Long, Long Trail.Wyrall, pp. 1‚Äì4. World War I =Mobilisation= In late July 1914 the units of the Northumbrian Division were at their annual training camp in North Wales. On 3 August they were ordered to return to their respective headquarters, where at 17.00 next day they received orders to mobilise. The 5th DLI mobilised at the Drill Hall, Stockton, under the command of Lt-Col G.O. Spence and went to its war station at the Hartlepools on the coast, where there were numerous alerts. On 5 September the York & Durham Bde went into camp at Ravensworth, near Gateshead, and in October the Northumbrian Division became part of Central Force in Home Defence, manning the Tyne Defences.DLI at Long, Long Trail. On the outbreak of war, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. The large majority of the Northumbrian Division accepted. On 15 August the War Office (WO) issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 49‚Äì54.63 Division at Long, Long Trail.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Wyrall, pp. 4‚Äì5. =1/5th Battalion= Ypres The Northumbrian Division trained hard while manning the Tyne Defences, and was ordered to proceed to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front early in 1915. The 1/5th DLI landed at Boulogne on 18 April and the division completed its concentration in the area of Steenvoorde on 23 April. It went straight into action the next day in the Battle of St Julien (part of the Second Battle of Ypres). The York and Durham Brigade went by bus to Poperinghe, where they debussed and marched to camp at Vlamertinghe. They were turned out at 01.00 on 24 April and marched to take over trenches astride Yser Canal, where they came under shellfire at first light. While other battalions made counter-attacks in support of the Canadian Division, 1/5th DLI moved to support trenches. A fresh counter-attack was ordered for 25 April, with 1/5th DLI and 1/5th Green Howards attacking beside 10th Brigade. The battalion reached its allotted position at 05.00, but found its flanks 'in the air' and returned to its former position; it had not been informed of a change to Zero hour. While 10th Bde made a gallant attack, 1/5th DLI remained in trenches along the St Jean‚ÄìSt Julien road under shellfire, sending forward patrols, but out of touch with Brigade HQ. Other battalions of the division were heavily engaged, but 1/5th DLI remained in position until the night of 26/27 April, when it moved up into the front line to relieve another unit. They were themselves relieved two nights later. The Ypres Salient was now a dangerous position, and on 2 and 3 May the division was involved in a general withdrawal to a more defensible line.Wyrall, pp. 5, 9, 13‚Äì5, 20‚Äì48. Preserved trenches at Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62. Apart from providing working parties, the infantry of the Northumbrian Division was barely engaged in the Battle of Frezenberg Ridge (8‚Äì13 May). On 14 May the division officially became the 50th (Northumbrian) Division and the York and Durham Brigade became 150th (York and Durham) Brigade. For the next 10 days the situation was quiet but on 24 May the Germans launched another serious attack accompanied with gas (the Battle of Bellewaarde Ridge). The 50th Division had been split up to reinforce other formations and the 1/5th DLI was with 2nd Cavalry Brigade on the north-east side of Sanctuary Wood, where some companies were gassed, suffering many casualties.Wyrall, pp. 49, 57‚Äì70. Over the following month the division was concentrated and took over its own section of the line south of Sanctuary Wood, 1/5th DLI relieving the Liverpool Scottish at Mount Sorrel on 6 June. 150th Brigade supported an attack at Bellwaarde on 16 June with rifle fire, but the spell in the line was relatively quiet. By the end of July the division had moved to the Armenti√®res sector. The division stayed in this quiet sector until mid-November, when it moved to Merris.Wyrall, pp. 71‚Äì7, 83‚Äì6, 89‚Äì92, 100. In December 1915 the division returned to the Ypres Salient, in the Hill 60‚ÄìMount Sorrel sector, in appalling conditions. In January 1916 the battalion machine-gun sections were withdrawn to form brigade machine gun companies of the Machine Gun Corps, but Lewis guns began to be issued to the infantry battalions. There was almost constant low-level fighting: on 14 February the enemy began a heavy bombardment of 150th Bde's trenches opposite Hill 60 and its rear areas, where 1/5th DLI was in brigade reserve, followed by blowing of mines. On 2 March an attack to recover The Bluff near Hill 60 was supported by intense fire from 50th Division's line. 150th Brigade was relieved at the end of March 1916 and the division moved to the Wytschaete sector. Here there were regular casualties from enemy shellfire and gas attacks, while the division carried out a number of raids on enemy lines. The division was withdrawn from the Wytschaete Sector in August 1916.Wyrall, pp. 100‚Äì9, 114‚Äì8, 120‚Äì34. Somme Flers, September 1916. 50th (Northumbrian) Division was not involved in the Somme Offensive until its third phase (the Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette). The division took over trenches west of High Wood facing the German Hook Trench on 10 September, in preparation for the attack on 15 September. 1/5th DLI was the reserve battalion for 150th Bde's attack, which was delivered on 15 September, behind a creeping barrage for the first time and quickly took Hook Trench. Despite flanking fire the brigade continued onto its second and third objectives. The attack was continued the following morning after a short bombardment, this time with 1/5th DLI in the lead and its CO, Lt-Col Spence, controlling the brigade attack. The battalion formed up in Martin Trench and advanced the towards the objectives, Prue Trench, Starfish Line and The Crescent, supported by bombing parties from the 1/4th and 1/5th Green Howards. The leading companies came under enfilade fire and took heavy casualties, losing direction, and only captured the western half of Prue Trench. The bombers tried to work along the Starfish Line but were driven back, and the small gains were consolidated, while Martin Trench in their rear was heavily bombarded. Further attempts were made that evening and the following afternoon and eventually the reinforced bombers cleared Prue and Starfish but could not take the Crescent, though German counter-attacks were driven back with Lewis gun fire. When the brigade was relieved on 19 September only four officers and 88 other ranks of 1/5th DLI answered roll-call, though many others were only slightly wounded or mixed up with other units and returned over the following days.Wyrall, pp. 138-57. The division made further piecemeal advances during the Battle of Morval (25‚Äì28 September), with 1/5th DLI pushing out posts from Prue Trench down Crescent Alley on the morning of 25 September. It then supported an attack by the rest of the brigade from this outpost line on the night of 26/27 September. The night attack failed, but at noon the following day a battle patrol from 1/5th DLI gained the objective. That evening the battalion extended the line towards Flers, though D Company found that reports of the village being clear of the enemy were incorrect. 150th Brigade was relieved on 28 September and was in reserve when 50th Division made another setpiece attack at the Battle of the Transloy Ridges on 1 October.Wyrall, pp. 161‚Äì4. William Orpen: The Butte de Warlencourt. The division's infantry returned to the line on 24 October for an attack on the Butte de Warlencourt, with 1/5th DLI in the valley north of Bazentin-le-Grand. The weather and mud were so bad that the attack was several times delayed, and 150th Bde was exhausted before the date was finally settled for 5 November, and was replaced. The attack was made by 151st (Durham Light Infantry) Brigade and was a muddy failure, with 1/5th DLI having to relieve the exhausted attackers afterwards. Further lodgements made in the enemy positions by 149th (Northumberland) Brigade on 14 November were also driven back.Wyrall, pp. 172‚Äì89. Arras After a winter spent trench-holding, 50th Division was moved to the Arras sector for the forthcoming offensive (the Battle of Arras). This opened on 9 April and on 12/13 April 50th Division took over some of the captured ground. 150th Brigade remained in reserve during the attack on 14 April. However, it was in the lead when the advance was renewed on 23 April in the Second Battle of the Scarpe. It attacked towards Wancourt Tower, supported by tanks and a heavy rolling artillery barrage. 1/5th DLI was in brigade reserve, instructed to set off at Zero plus 15 minutes (05.00) onto the hillside north of the Tower. The barrage moved too slowly, and the assaulting infantry suffered casualties by advancing into it. They took their early objectives, but got into difficulties. 1/5th DLI sent up D Company at 06.30 carrying spare ammunition and to fill the gap that had opened between the two attacking battalions. They reached the railway line but could not contact one of the battalions and their flank was left in the air. B Company then followed up. By 08.10 the remnants of the attackers and their DLI supports were back in the British front line fighting off a counter-attack. The division attacked with a fresh brigade in the afternoon, preceded by another barrage and with 1/5th DLI once more in support; this succeeded and they held their objectives by nightfall. The casualties amongst 1/5th DLI that day were four officers and 23 other ranks killed, three officers and 137 other ranks wounded, and one officer and 96 other ranks missing.Wyrall, pp. 207‚Äì23. During the summer of 1917 the division held a section of the line, with frequent raids and exchanges of artillery fire. On the night of 25/26 June 1/5th DLI and 1/5th Green Howards led a brigade-scale raid. The battalion had A and B Companies engaged, and captured all but a small section of their objective, establishing a new strongpoint in the captured trench near 'Rotten Row'. The battalion only suffered about 10 casualties in this action. On 27 July the battalion attempted a small raid of two officers and 20 other ranks. After advancing without seeing any enemy, they were attacked with a show of stick-grenades and had to withdraw, carrying their wounded.Wyrall, pp. 229‚Äì37. Passchendaele In October 50th Division returned to the Ypres Salient to take part in the last and worst phase of the Third Ypres Offensive, the Second Battle of Passchendaele. 149th Brigade attacked at 05.40 on 26 October, but from the first the infantry struggling through the mud could not keep up with the creeping barrage, which had no effect on the concrete pillboxes. The suffered appalling casualties and gained almost no ground. 150th Brigade relieved them that night, with 1/5th DLI at Pascal Farm in support. Some advances were made on 30 and 31 October, and the division was finally withdrawn for rest and training on 9 November.Wyrall, pp. 239‚Äì49. By February 1918 the BEF was suffering a severe manpower crisis and infantry brigades were reorganised on a three-battalion establishment. 1/5th DLI moved to 151st (DLI) Bde on 12 February, replacing two battalions that had been transferred.Wyrall, pp. 253‚Äì4. Rosi√®res 50th (Northumbrian) Division was 20‚Äì25 miles behind the lines in GHQ Reserve when the German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March 1918 (the Battle of St Quentin). The infantry of the division marched across the River Somme and were deployed for action on the 'Green Line' by 08.00 that morning. There they attempted to improve the partially-dug defences before the troops retreating from the German advance passed through them. 1/5th DLI was sent forward on loan to 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division, taking up a position near Nobescourt Farm to stop the enemy debouching from Roisel. Once 66th Division had passed through, the battalion retired to the Green Line, taking up its position on the right of 151st Bde, but part of the battalion was almost cut off at Nobescourt Farm, where it held out until ordered to withdraw. Although the attack ceased at nightfall, the division was ordered to pull back towards the Somme Canal, which it carried out covered by darkness and next morning's mist.Blaxland, pp. 50, 56, 63Middlebrook, pp. 128, 207‚Äì8, 274.Murland, pp. 156‚Äì60.Wyrall, pp. 258‚Äì70. Most of 50th Division played little part in the Battle of the Somme Crossings on 24 March, but 1/5th DLI was still detached with 66th Division at Foucaucourt. As the Germans began crossing the canal, companies of the battalion were sent forward ready to counter-attack. At 18.00 D Company joined 2/8th Bn Lancashire Fusiliers attacking the bridgehead at P√©ronne; the DLI made two attempts, but the task was too great for a single company. At dawn on 25 March A and B Companies were in bivouacs near Villers-Carbonnel, D Company was in the front line with 66th Division, and C Company was in support about south of La Maisonette. A violent enemy bombardment began at 09.00 and strong German forces crossed the canal. 1/5th DLI was ordered to counter-attack and A and B Companies set off, under attack by German aircraft, and occupied the high ground overlooking the valley leading from the Somme to Barleux. They were joined by the other companies and by part of 1/7th DLI (50th Division's pioneer battalion), which had been driven back from the canal. They were positioned in a well-wired old trench, with 1/7th DLI on the left, but with their right flank in the air. From this commanding position the battalion caused heavy casualties to the advancing Germans. Just before dusk the Germans massed for an attack, but the DLI were able to signal back to Brigade HQ, and a battery of field guns dispersed the attack with rapid fire. By now the DLI were isolated: orders to withdraw during the night failed to reach the battalion, but fortuitously they made contact with a small party of Northumberland Fusiliers who had been sent to cover their withdrawal, and eventually the 1/5th and /17th DLI got away to be attached to 149th Bde.Wyrall, pp. 274‚Äì5, 284-6.Dunn, pp. 151‚Äì2. On the morning of 26 March the Germans renewed their attacks, bringing on the Battle of Rosi√®res. 66th Division was forced back, uncovering the flank of 149th Bde, which had to withdraw to the Rosi√®res‚ÄìVauvillers line. The following morning, A and D Companies of 1/5th DLI were covering Rosi√®res station, while the rest of the battalion (about 5 officers and 120‚Äì140 men) were at Vauvillers in support of 149th Bde. The enemy attacked the new line about 08.00, and at 11.00 A and D Companies were ordered to withdraw to the railway bridge between Rosi√®res and Guillaucourt, covered by a counter-attack by C Company when the battalion on the left withdrew too soon. The withdrawal and a subsequent counter-attack along with 1/7th DLI were carried out under attack by 8‚Äì9 enemy aircraft, shellfire and machine gun fire: 'After a while it became very exciting as we could see the enemy halt and turn back through the trees near Vauvillers. Our men gave a sort of grunt and advanced ten times as quickly as before'. By the end of 27 March the battalion was back at Rosi√®res station, tired and short of ammunition, where it came under the orders of 8th Division.Dunn, pp. 152‚Äì3.Murland, pp. 191‚Äì2.Wyrall, pp. 287‚Äì300. On the morning of 28 March 149th Bde (including 1/5th DLI) moved back to the Caix‚ÄìGuillaucourt line, where it received yet another attack. By the end of the day the exhausted brigade had retired across the River Luce to Moreuil on the Avre. On 29 March the brigade came under the command of 20th (Light) Division and was ordered to advance in support of an attack by that formation, which failed. The consequent retirement of 20th Division uncovered the flank of 149th Bde, which launched a second counter-attack, 1/5th DLI attacking a wood immediately north of Villers. This gave the 20th time to reform. On 31 March the Germans attacked yet again, pushing 20th and 50th Divisions back, apart from 1/5th DLI and 6th Northumberland Fusiliers, who held their ground covering Hangard, only to be attacked by the British 18th (Eastern) Division under the impression that the Germans held Hangard. The remnants of 50th Division were relieved on 1 April.Blaxland, pp. 96‚Äì7. 102.Wyrall, pp. 301‚Äì5. Estaires Out of the line the 50th Division reorganised, absorbing large numbers of inexperienced reinforcements, and 1/5th DLI returned to 151st Bde. On the night of 9/10 April it was due to relieve the 2nd Portuguese Division in front of Estaires, but the second phase of the German Spring Offensive (Operation Georgette) was launched on 9 April (the Battle of Estaires) and broke through the Portuguese positions. 50th Division was 'stood to' as soon as the German bombardment began, and the regimental band played as the 1/5th DLI marched off to its assigned battle position covering the bridgeheads across the River Lys at La Gorgue, Nouveau Monde (Pont Levis) and Pont de la Meuse. Estaires was already under shellfire and becoming impassable for transport, and the battalion suffered casualties before it had cleared the town. As the Portuguese retreated, the positions taken up by the battalion became the Allied front line. The first German column reached the Lys at Nouveau Monde some time before 15.00 and 1/5th DLI was ordered to hold Pont Levis at all costs and to counter-attack with a reserve company towards Laventie to improve the position. By 18.00 the situation was becoming serious, and 1/5th DLI had used up all its reserves. The Pont Levis bridgehead was lost but recaptured in a counter-attack by the men of 151st Brigade Trench Mortar Battery. German troops supported by artillery, mortars and machine guns, pushed the garrison back again and looked as if they would hold the bridge, but it was recaptured by a rushed led by Privates T. Tweddle and E. Dean. By 19.00 enemy field guns had been brought up to smash the bridgeheads and machine guns in Nouveau Monde had enfiladed the garrisons, and it was decided to blow up the bridges. 1/5th DLI was ordered back across the river; Pont de la Mueuse and the bridge at La Gorgue were destroyed, but two attempts to blow up Pont Levis failed to destroy it completely. 1/5th Durham Light Infantry were relieved by 149th Bde.Blaxland, p. 119.Dunn, pp. 157‚Äì8.Wyrall, pp. 308‚Äì15. The battalion endured heavy fighting around Estaires the next day, and were withdrawn at 20.00 to positions south-east of Vierhouck, where it took up positions in some old trenches running from the Estaires‚ÄìNeuf-Berquin road to a bend in the Lys Canal. It was attacked at daybreak on 11 April, with enemy mortars and field guns brought up to close range, and snipers operating behind iron shields. The German infantry advanced from Estaires and La Gorgue and penetrated a gap between the 1/5th and 1/6th DLI, threatening to envelop C Company of 1/5th. The battalion fell back slowly to a line east of Neuf- Berquin that had been prepared by the Royal Engineers with an excellent field of fire. Here they caused heavy casualties until driven out by close-range artillery and concentrated machine gun fire, losing their CO (Lt-Col G.O. Spence) wounded. 'The line was now composed of small groups of men utterly worn out with continuous fighting and isolated from one another'. But the German troops discovered liquor stores at Estaires and Neuf-Berquin and their officers lost control of them. 1/5th Durham Light Infantry was able to withdraw unmolested and dig in on a new line. The Germans renewed the attack on 12 April (the Battle of Hazebrouck), but by now 50th Division was being pulled out. 4th Guards Brigade relieved 1/5th DLI, whose survivors went to reinforce the line opposite Merville. Fortunately, the enemy pressure was not great, and 151st Bde was fully relieved at 03.00 on 13 April.Blaxland, p. 120.Wyrall, pp. 323, 327‚Äì9, 332‚Äì4. Aisne Once again the thinned ranks of the battalions were brought up to strength with inexperienced reinforcements, and in late May 1918 50th Division was moved to a 'quiet' sector on the Chemin des Dames to relieve French troops. However, intelligence warned of impending attack, and on 26 May 1/5th DLI was moved up from reserve. The following day the next phase of the German Offensive opened on the Chemin des Dames ridge (the Third Battle of the Aisne). The front line was flattened by German artillery, and the attack was led by tanks. C and D Companies of 1/5th DLI were sent to garrison 'International Line', followed by A and B Companies. C and D Companies held up the advance for a while, but found the enemy behind them in Pontavert and they withdrew to a line near the dressing station in that village. A and B Companies were simply surrounded and captured. 149th and 151st Brigades combined to hold Hill 233 on 28 May, and by 29 May the whole division had been reduced to the strength of a single composite battalion, which fought on for several days as the German offensive was eventually stopped.Blaxland, pp. 136‚Äì8.Murland, p. 212.Wyrall, pp. 333‚Äì9, 342-9. On 15 July 1918, the battalions of the DLI Bde were reduced to training cadres and moved to Dieppe on the lines of communication. On 18 August the battalion cadres joined 117th Bde of 39th Division at Rouen, where they were used to train American troops. 1/5th Durham Light Infantry was demobilised on 9 November 1918 as the war was drawing to a close.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 97‚Äì100. =2/5th Battalion= The 2/5th DLI was formed on 2 January 1915 at Stockton and in May was at Longbenton, near Newcastle upon Tyne where 2nd Northumbrian Divisional HQ had opened in January 1915. By now all the division's Home Service men had been transferred to separate units and thenceforth the 2nd Line units had the role of training drafts for the 1st Line serving in France. While under training they were responsible for defending the coast of North East England from Seaham Harbour through Sunderland to Newcastle, with 2/5th DLI at Cramlington. The division officially became the 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) Division on 16 August, when the 2nd York and Durham Brigade was numbered 189th. In November 1915 the division moved into winter quarters with 2/5th DLI at Retford. The 63rd Division never reached its intended establishment, and the continuous demand from the Western Front for reinforcements meant that it could never take the field. In July 1916 189th Bde furnished another large draft for 1st Line units overseas, after which the division was broken up. The brigades remained in existence as draft-finding units, the 189th moving to Catterick Camp after the disbandment of the division. On 31 October 1916 the 2/5th DLI left 189th Bde and went via Le Havre and Marseilles to Salonika to be a garrison battalion. On arrival on 15 November it was assigned to XVI Corps Troops. On 1 March 1917 the battalion joined 228th Bde. Although an independent formation, 228 Bde was always associated with 28th Division.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 107‚Äì111.28th Division at Long, Long Trail. The brigade was formed of garrison battalions, which were not normally expected to serve in the front line due to the men's age or low medical category.Wakefield & Moody, p. 136. One staff officer wrote: 'Physically the brigade was in a terrible state. They were splendid crocks ... Some were almost blind, some almost deaf, and [one battalion] ... had more than sixty men over sixty years old'.Capt Christopher Hughes, quoted in Wakefield & Moody, p. 136. Because of its slow rate of marching, the 228th became known as the 'Too Too Late Brigade'.Wakefield & Moody, pp. 136‚Äì7. On 30 September 1918, during the final Allied offensive on the Salonika Front, 228 Bde came under the command of the Greek Crete Division, before being broken up on 4 October 1918. However, 2/5th DLI continued its garrison duties after the war ended, finally being disbanded at Constantinople on 20 October 1919. =3/5th Battalion= The 3/5th Bn was formed at Stockton on 25 March 1915 and then moved to Catterick, where its role was to train drafts for the 1st and 2nd Line battalions. On 8 April 1916 it was renamed the 5th Reserve Bn DLI and on 1 September it absorbed the Reserve battalions of the other DLI TF battalions as part of the Northumbrian Reserve Brigade. In October it moved to Redcar and then back to Catterick in December. In the summer of 1917 it moved to Hornsea, and then in the spring of 1918 to Sutton-on-Sea where it remained as part of the Humber Garrison for the rest of the war. It was disbanded on 17 April 1919. =27th Battalion= In 1915 the Home Service men of the 5th DLI and 4th East Yorkshire Regiment were combined into the 25th Provisional Battalion at York, where they were joined by the unfit men from the 2nd and 3rd Line TF battalions. The battalion served in home defence with 2nd Provisional Brigade, under the orders of Southern Army, and was billeted in St Osyth in Essex .Army Council Instructions, January 1916, Appendix 18.David Porter's work on Provisional Brigades at Great War Forum.Distribution of Northern and Southern Armies (Home Defence), The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 33/765. The Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. The Provisional Brigades thus became anomalous, and on 1 January 1917 the remaining battalions became numbered battalions of their parent units: 25th Provisional Bn became 27th Battalion DLI and 2nd Provisional Brigade became the 222nd Brigade. Part of these units' role was physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting overseas, alongside units of the Training Reserve. The brigade moved to the Isle of Thanet in April 1917 but never served overseas, and 27th DLI was demobilised at Canterbury on 4 July 1919.Army Council Instruction 2364 of December 1916 (Appendix 204).Frederick, pp. 146, 184. Interwar The TF was reconstituted on 7 February 1920 and tth Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, was reformed at Stockton. The TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) the following year. Once again the battalion formed part of 150th (York and Durham) Brigade in 50th (Northumbrian) Division.Titles and Designations 1927. 90 cm 'Projector Anti-Aircraft', displayed at Fort Nelson, Hampshire. During the late 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into AA units. 5th Battalion DLI was converted to the searchlight (S/L) role in 1938 as 54th Searchlight Regiment. Immediately afterwards the TA was expanded following the Munich Crisis, with 5th DLI forming a duplicate unit in early 1939, leading to the following organisation:Frederick, pp. 859, 861‚Äì2, 869. 1/5th Battalion DLI (54th Searchlight Regiment) * HQ at Drill Hall, Church Road, Stockton-on-Tees * 411, 412, 413 AA Companies 2/5th Battalion DLI (55th Searchlight Regiment) * HQ at Drill Hall, Avenue Road, West Hartlepool * 414, 415, 416 AA Companies World War II =Mobilisation= In February 1939 the UK's AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June 1939 a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. Both DLI units were in 43 AA Brigade of 7 AA Division, which was still being formed in North East England when war was declared.AA Command on 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. =54th Searchlight Regiment= Equipment was critically short at the outbreak of war. Luckily, the months of the Phoney War that followed mobilisation allowed AA Command to address its equipment shortages and a Gun Defence Area (GDA) with heavy AA (HAA) guns supported by S/Ls was established by 43 AA Bde around Teesside including Middlesbrough and Billingham.Routledge, p. 373. Blitz Formation sign of 10 AA Division, worn 1940‚Äì42 On 1 August 1940 all the infantry units converted to the S/L role became part of the Royal Artillery (RA), so the 1/5th DLI became 54th (Durham Light Infantry) Searchlight Regiment, RA.Litchfield, pp. 55‚Äì8.Farndale, Annex M.54 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. By the time the Luftwaffe's night Blitz against British cities began, 54th S/L Rgt had transferred to 31 (North Midland) AA Bde responsible for S/L defence of the West Yorkshire towns and cities. This became part of a new 10 AA Division on 1 November 1940.Pile's despatch.Farndale, Annex D.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396. The S/L layouts had been based on a spacing of , but due to equipment shortages this had been extended to . As the Luftwaffe switched to night raids against London and other cities the S/L layout was changed in November to clusters of three lights to improve illumination, but this meant that the clusters had to be spaced apart. The cluster system was an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or RAF Night fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with searchlight control (SLC or 'Elsie') radar and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply. The number of raiders shot down steadily increased until mid-May 1941, when the Luftwaffe scaled down its attacks.Collier, Chapter XVI.Collier, Chapter XVII.Routledge, p. 393. Mid-War 54th (DLI) Searchlight Rgt supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 235th S/L Training Rgt at Ayr where it provided the basis for a new 530 S/L Bty formed on 14 November 1940. This battery later joined 55th (DLI) S/L Rgt (see below). Meanwhile 547 S/L Bty was formed on 16 January 1941 at 232nd S/L Training Rgt at Devizes from a cadre provided by 40th (Sherwood Foresters) S/L Rgt. This battery was regimented with 54th S/L Rgt on 5 May 1941. It established its HQ at Otley where it was temporarily joined by a few officers from 411, 412 and 413 Btys, and its men 'double-banked' S/L sites operated by 370 Bty of 43rd (Duke of Wellington's Regiment) S/L Rgt. After this familiarisation period, 370 S/L Bty left and the new battery took over the sites at places all across Yorkshire, such as Adel, Killinghall, and Tickhill. Occasional night raids continue to pass over on their way to attack the West Yorkshire towns.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79.547 S/L Bty War Diary 1941, TNA file WO 166/3378. 150 cm Searchlight with SLC Radar No 2 ('Elsie'). By the Summer of 1941 AA Command began to receive purpose-built SLC radar in sufficient numbers to allow some S/Ls to be 'declustered' into single-light sites. These were redeployed into 'Indicator Belts' of radar-controlled S/L clusters covering approaches to the RAF's night-fighter sectors, repeated by similar belts covering AA Command's GDAs. Inside each belt was a 20-mile deep 'Killer Belt' of single S/Ls spaced at intervals, cooperating with night-fighters patrolling defined 'boxes'. The pattern was designed to ensure that raids penetrating deeply towards the GDAs would cross more than one belt, and the GDAs had more S/Ls at close spacing.Routledge, p. 99.Routledge, pp. 398‚Äì404. 54th S/L Rgt established a regimental school at Huttons Ambo where the Master Detachments for each indicator belt cluster were trained. In July it provided 12 'Scarecrow' S/L detachments supporting a Heavy AA Regiment deployed along the Yorkshire Coast, and it deployed mobile detachments each with a 90 cm S/L, sound detector and Light machine gun (LMG) at positions around RAF Church Fenton. 547 S/L Battery left the regiment in January 1942, and the following month it was converted into 413 Light AA (LAA) Bty in 124th LAA Rgt, itself formed from 51st (Highland) S/L Rgt.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80.413 LAA Bty War Diary February ‚ÄìSeptember 1942, TNA file WO 166/7761. In September 1942, 413 LAA Bty left 124th LAA Rgt and joined 140th LAA Rgt in Essex, and afterwards moved to 143rd LAA Rgt; it remained in the UK for the rest of the war.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81. On 30 September 1942 the AA Divisions and Corps were dissolved and a new 5 AA Group assumed responsibility for North-East England, including 31 AA Bde. The regiment remained part of this organisation for the next two years.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, TNA file WO 212/83.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, TNA file WO 212/84. North West Europe Early in 1944, 31 AA Bde and its S/L units were earmarked for overseas service with 21st Army Group in Operation Overlord. The regiments re-equipped their AA LMG sections with twin Browning machine guns and carried out 'Bullseye' S/L exercises over North East England with the Night fighters of No. 264 Squadron RAF. Between training, field force AA units were loaned back to AA Command, and 31 AA Bde retained its responsibilities under 5 AA Group.31 AA Bde War Diary, 1944, TNA file WO 171/1080.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, TNA file WO 212/85. The 'Overlord' planners envisaged searchlight-assisted night-fighter cover of the whole Normandy beachhead and bases once the landings had been made. A detailed plan was made in advance to have a belt of S/L positions deployed from Caen to the Cherbourg peninsula. This required nine S/L batteries of 24 lights, spaced at intervals, six rows deep. Each battery area was to have an orbit beacon, around which up to four fighters would be positioned at varying heights. These would be allocated by fighter controllers, and the S/Ls would assist by illuminating targets and indicating raid approaches, while area boundaries would be marked by vertical S/Ls. 54th (DLI) was one of six S/L regiments specially trained for this work under 31 and 50 AA Bdes. In practice, most of this was never implemented, liaison with the US Army units around Cherbourg having proved problematical. In the end, only one of the S/L regiments was actually deployed and came under US command.Routledge, p. 304.Routledge, pp. 313‚Äì6. Even though assigned to GHQ AA Troops for 21st Army Group, 31 AA Bde remained in England under AA Command while the Normandy campaign was fought.Routledge, Table XLIX, p. 319; Table L, p. 327. 54th S/L Regiment moved to its concentration area on 23 June, but when the break-out from the beachhead began in early September it was still in England. 31 Brigade HQ finally landed at Arromanches on 2 October, but 54 S/L Rgt remained in England, training round Shaftesbury in Dorset into late October. V-1 in flight over Antwerp Brussels was liberated from the Germans in September 1944, and in October it came under bombardment by V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers'). To deal with this menace, an integrated system ('Brussels X' ) was developed with warning stations and observation posts, supported by radar and searchlights under the operational command of 101st AA Brigade. 54th S/L Regiment was despatched from England to join this layout, arriving between 10 and 19 November.Routledge, Table LII, p. 331. Captured V-1 displayed at Antwerp at the end of World War II. The vital supply port of Antwerp was also under Diver attack, while the approaches up the Scheldt estuary to Antwerp Docks and the Ghent canal were menaced by torpedo boats, midget submarines and aircraft dropping Parachute mines. These were covered by LAA guns, but they needed more S/L coverage at night, and in December 54th S/L Rgt was brought across from 'Brussels X' to join 5th Royal Marines AA Bde at Antwerp.Routledge, p. 335; Table LIII, p. 342. These forces, with various changes in brigade responsibilities, remained in action until April 1945. At the end of the month, just before hostilities ended on VE Day, 411 S/L Bty was detached with 50 AA Bde on the Scheldt.Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366. On 12 May all AA positions in 21st Army Group were ordered to stand down, but this did not at first apply to those in coastal positions such as the Scheldt, because of uncertainty about the intentions of German naval units still at sea when the surrender was signed.Routledge, p. 363. 54th (DLI) S/L regiment passed into suspended animation on 4 February 1946. Formation sign of 7 AA Division, worn 1940‚Äì42 =55th Searchlight Regiment= As with the 1/5th DLI, the 2/5th Bn was transferred to the RA in August 1940 as 55th (Durham Light Infantry) Searchlight Regiment, RA. 54 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. It remained in 43 AA Bde in 7 AA Division covering North East England during the Blitz. 530 Searchlight Bty formed by a cadre from 54th (DLI) S/L Rgt (see above) was regimented on 11 February 1941. Meanwhile 55th (DLI) S/L Rgt itself supplied a cadre to 234th S/L Training Rgt at Carlisle to form a new 557 S/L Bty on 13 February. This battery later joined a new 92nd S/L Rgt. In the autumn of 1941, 57 LAA Bde assumed responsibility for all the S/L units in 7 AA Division. At the end of 1941 AA Command was still critically short of LAA units, and began a programme of converting S/L regiments to that role. 55th (DLI) S/L Regiment was one of those selected, and in January 1942 it became 113th (Durham Light Infantry) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment.Frederick, pp. 805, 838.Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. =113th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment= Bofors gun and crew, January 1942. The new regiment was organised with 368, 369, 370, 371 LAA Btys, and at the beginning of April 1942 it took its place in 41 (London) AA Bde, defending East Anglia as part of 2 AA Division (5 AA Group from October 1942). 371 LAA Battery was transferred to 20th LAA Rgt on 12 July 1942. In June 1943 371 LAA Bty became independent as AA Command Operational Trials Battery at Minster on the Isle of Sheppey and at gunsite TS21 by the Thames Estuary, which was used by the scientists of AA Command's Operational Research Group under Patrick Blackett ('Blackett's Circus').371 LAA Bty War Diary June 1943, TNA file WO 166/11779.20th LAA Rgt War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 11692.371 LAA Bty War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 166/14770.Routledge, p. 392. 55th Searchlight Rgt left 41 AA Bde at the beginning of December 1942, and early in 1943 it left AA Command entirely to join 21st Army Group as a mobile regiment equipped with Bofors 40 mm guns.Order of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 2: 21 Army Group, 24 July 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/238.Routledge, p. 306. Normandy When Operation Overlord was launched on D-Day, 6 June 1944, 113th LAA Rgt was in 100 AA Bde waiting to cross to Normandy. Some of the brigade's units, including 113th LA Rgt less one of its batteries, were sent on ahead to operate under 80 AA Bde. On arrival on 25 June, the regiment's CO was ordered to deploy his guns at three Vital Points (VPs) along the Caen Canal and take over as AA Defence Commander (AADC) for these sites. On 15 July the CO and brigadier reconnoitred new gunsites to cover a new bridge the Royal Engineers were to build across the Caen Canal in connection with the forthcoming offensive (Operation Goodwood). 370 S/L Battery arrived and took over this new VP. Because of 'friendly fire' incidents most AA guns in the bridgehead were forbidden to fire during daylight hours, but this restriction did not apply to the four VPs at the canal bridges, where day and night engagements against Luftwaffe raiders were frequent and intense.Routledge, Table XLIX, p. 319Ellis, p. 335.Pakenham-Walsh, pp. 365‚Äì6.80 AA Bde War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085. 113th LAA Regiment was withdrawn from 80 AA Bde on 13 August and left the canal to rejoin 100 AA Bde, which had arrived in stages over the previous few weeks. When 21st Army Group broke out from the Normandy beachhead in the last days of August and crossed the Seine, 100 AA Bde followed up to provide LAA defence for the bridges. As the advance continued, it carried out the same procedure at the Somme crossings on 30 August. When the leading motorised groups of XII Corps and XXX Corps reached the outskirts of Antwerp on 5 September, the reconnaissance parties, tactical HQs and leading batteries of 100 and 106 AA Bdes were close on their heels. 113th LAA Rgt entered the city as the LAA component of 106 AA BdeRoutledge, p. 320; Table L, p. 327. Low Countries This rapid advance was followed by the attempt to seize all the bridges to the Nederrijn at Arnhem (Operation Market Garden). The operation was a failure overall, but XXX Corps got over the Waal at Nijmegen. 113th LAA Regiment was back under 100 AA Bde, the leading parties of which arrived on 20 September while fighting for the bridges was still going on, an advance from the Seine of carried out in 21 days. The follow-up columns travelling the last stage of the journey up the single road were several times interrupted by air attacks and by tank fire. On 27 September 368 LAA Battery got up to the bridges, where there were frequent air attacks by day and night, and the bridgehead was under continuous shellfire. The following day, 113th LAA Rgt (less one battery) was deployed north of the bridges on AA and ground defence, while another troop of the regiment with 474th Independent S/L Bty became responsible for defending the bridges against attack from the river, by mines, assault craft or torpedo boats. On 29 September, German Frogmen succeeded in placing explosive charges on the bridge piers. Nevertheless, the bridges remained serviceable or repairable. This deployment continued until 10 November, when 100 AA Bde was finally relieved of its fighting garrison responsibilities and moved to join VIII Corps to prepare for future operations.Routledge, pp. 324‚Äì5, Table LI, pp. 329‚Äì30, Table LII, p. 331.474 S/L Bty War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1213. Bofors crew on alert, Dutch‚ÄìGerman border 25 December 1944. By late December, 100 AA Bde was with VIII Corps in southern Holland around Weert, Helmond and Deurne, preparing to cross the Maas. Luftwaffe air activity had been slight for several weeks, but on 17 December it carried out hundreds of sorties over 21st Army Group in support of the Ardennes Offensive (the Battle of the Bulge). These attacks by groups of Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 Fighter- bombers against the Maas and Waal bridges and on artillery positions were carried out at low level to avoid radar detection and the fighters of 2nd Tactical Air Force, and so the primary defences were the LAA guns. Further waves of low-level attacks were made on 24 December and culminated on New Year's Day with Operation Bodenplatte. In 100 AA Bde's area about 50 enemy aircraft were active on 1 January, of which eight were shot down. The LAA batteries noticed that well-concerted fire dissuaded many pilots from pressing home their attacks. The LAA batteries were now able to fire effective radar- controlled barrages at night, and practised combining LAA fire with S/L dazzle.Routledge, pp. 345‚Äì7. Across the Rhine 21st Army Group resumed its offensive in February 1945 with the three-week Operation Veritable to clear the Rhineland, in which 113th LAA Rgt was with 100 AA Bde supporting VIII Corps across the Maas towards Venlo. This was followed by the set-piece assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder), in which 100 AA Bde supported XII Corps. The huge build-up of equipment and supplies represented a major AA defence task. Then 48 hours before Zero, the regiment was one of those that moved into concealed positions close up to the river bank. The operation. began on XII Corps' front at 22.00 on the night of 23/24 March. The Luftwaffe appeared the following night, with scattered attacks on bridging sites, artillery areas and supply routes, but there were few in 100 AA Bde's area. On D+1 (25 March) 113th LAA Rgt moved forward to defend the west bank bridgehead while 112th (DLI) LAA Rgt began taking up positions across the river. That night there were larger numbers of attacks by Junkers Ju 88 bombers, but 112th and 113th LAA Rgts dealt with these by firing 'radial zone' Bofors barrages using radar data; three enemy aircraft were shot down and others took evasive action. The following night was again busy, with disjointed raiding, but the night of 27 March was the last of any significant action. By 28 March XII Corps' bridges at Xanten were complete and the armoured divisions were beginning to advance across Germany.Routledge, pp. 349‚Äì59; Table LVI, p. 365..Pakenham-Walsh, pp. 482‚Äì8. The regiments of 100 AA Bde advanced with VIII and XII Corps towards the Weser, which was crossed between 9 and 11 April. There were brisk actions against dive-bombers and fighter-bombers. German resistance diminished once the Weser was crossed, and a number of AA units handed in their equipment and were employed on occupation duties. On 24 April, 113th LAA Rgt was ordered to join 103 AA Bde operating as infantry in the Fallingbostel area. The regiment's duties included ameliorating the horrors of the newly-liberated Belsen concentration camp. When the German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath was signed on 5 May the occupation troops were fully engaged in collecting, controlling and repatriating Displaced persons, released Prisoners of war, and surrendered German troops.Routledge, pp. 362‚Äì3; Table LVII, p. 366.103 AA Bde War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4900. 113th (DLI) LAA Regiment went into suspended animation between 1 February and 18 March 1946. Postwar AA Command formation sign When the TA was reformed on 1 January 1947, 54th S/L Rgt was reconstituted at Stockton as 589 (The Durham Light Infantry) Searchlight Regiment, RA, and 113th LAA Rgt as 590 (The Durham Light Infantry) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, both in 56 (Northumbrian) AA Bde based at Sunderland as part of 3 AA Group. Both were redesignated as Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight regiments on 16 March 1949, 589 becoming a 'Mixed' regiment including members of the Women's Royal Army Corps.Frederick, p. 1024.564‚Äì591 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA.67‚Äì106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on. AA Command was disbanded in 1955 and there were wholesale mergers among its TA regiments. The two DLI units amalgamated with 485 (Tees) Heavy AA Rgt at Middlesbrough to form 437 Light Anti-Aircraft Rgt with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 1013.Litchfield, p. 177.414‚Äì443 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards. * RHQ at West Hartlepool * P (North Riding) Bty ‚Äì from 485 Rgt * Q (Stockton) Bty ‚Äì from 589 Rgt * R (Hartlepool) Bty ‚Äì from 590 Rgt In this reorganisation some of 590 LAA/SL Rgt's personnel also formed 508 Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, in 105 (Tyne Electrical Engineers) Engineer Rgt, transferring in 1961 to 118 (Tees) Corps Engineer Regiment and disbanding in 1967.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 292, 294, 305.337‚Äì575 Sqns RE at British Army 1945 on.

The DLI parts of the regiment joined 72 Engineer Rgt, RE, in which part of R Bty formed a Troop of 118 Field Squadron at Sunderland.Tyne Electrical Engineers at Regiments.org. The TAVR was expanded again in 1971, and the cadre of the County of Durham Rgt formed A (Durham Royal Artillery) Battery at Hordern in a new regiment, the Northumbrian Volunteers. This battalion in turn was broken up in 1975, with A (Durham Royal Artillery) and E (6th/8th DLI) Companies transferring to 7th Battalion, The Light Infantry, thus reuniting four out of five of the former Volunteer units of the DLI in one battalion (the 9th battalion became a parachute unit). Insignia In 1941, 55th (DLI) S/L Rgt sought permission to add the subtitle 'Palatine' and to adopt as their regimental arm badge the coat of arms of the Bishopric of Durham (a blue shield bearing a gold cross and a gold lion rampant in each quarter). Copies of the badge were printed and worn but permission for the title and badge was refused. After World War II, sergeants and above of 590 LAA Rgt wore a green lanyard to symbolise their DLI heritage.

She holds a J.D. degree and worked for several years as director of local affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union advocating for civil liberties and civil rights before becoming a newspaper columnist and editorial writer in Florida. Early life Blumner was born May 14, 1961 in Queens, New York City. Her parents were teachers and politically active union members, her mother being a registered Democrat, her father being an independent voter who occasionally voted Republican. Her grandmother had been awarded a law degree but had not practised, as women in those days were unable to obtain an apprenticeship to practice law. Both her parents were Jewish, with her father actively practising. In an interview with the Richard Dawkins Foundation she states that she began questioning religion around age 11 and stopped attending Hebrew school and did not have Bat Mitzvah. Nevertheless, she acknowledges a shared Jewish identity and said, ‚ÄúA belief in god is not essential to being Jewish. Humanist values were far more important than religious practice to Jewish identity.‚Äù She was raised in Glen Cove, Long Island and became interested in politics from a young age, leafleting for Senator George McGovern during his 1972 presidential campaign and organizing the Young Democrats while at school. In 1982 she was awarded a BA in Industrial and labor relations from Cornell University. From there she went to New York University School of Law and in 1985 completed a J.D. degree. While studying for her that degree she began working for the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees and the Staten Island Rapid Transit Operating Authority where she became assistant director of labor-management relations. Around the same time Blumner first became active as a volunteer in the American Civil Liberties Union where she became absorbed by The Reproductive Freedom Project and soon decided that civil liberties was a field she wanted to pursue. Career =Civil liberties= From 1987 Blumner held the position of executive director at the American Civil Liberties Union In Utah where she frequently acted as spokesperson on topics such as freedom of speech (including for white supremacists such as Aryan Nations) and abortion rights. From 1989 she was director of the ACLU for Florida where she campaigned on various civil liberties issues such as reproductive rights, right to demonstrate, First Amendment rights and sexual discrimination. That organization gave her the Gardner W. Beckett, Jr. Civil Liberties Award in 2001 and the Irene Miller Vigilance in Journalism Award in 2010 to honor her work. Controversially while with the ACLU, Blumner stated she is against affirmative action (also referred to as positive discrimination), saying ‚ÄúI can no longer sit silently while my cohorts defend a discriminatory policy that favors groups of people solely on their gender, skin color or national origin...An advantage granted me due to my sex demeans my individuality, reducing me to a walking immutable characteristic.‚Äù =Journalism= From 1998 to 2014 Blumner was an opinion writer for Tampa Bay Times (formerly the St. Petersburg Times), was syndicated in papers across the country and is described as a columnist and editorial writer. In 2012 Blumner, along with John Hill, Joni James and Tim Nickens, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for their work at the Tampa Bay Times in conducting an extensive investigation of a state governor and the effects of his inexperience on the state. Blumner is an author and contributor to several publications including Center for Inquiry in association with the Council for Secular Humanism and Time magazine in her capacity as CEO and president of CFI, and for her experience in civil liberties. She has contributed essays and forewords to several published works by other authors. From 2008-2009 she was also a regular contributor to Huffington Post. =Science education and secularism= Blumner speaking at CSICon in 2017 In 2004 Blumner was awarded the Emperor Has No Clothes Award from the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which describes it as an ‚Äúaward celebrating ‚Äòplain speaking‚Äô on the shortcomings of religion by public figures.‚Äù In February 2014 Blumner joined the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS) as executive director, replacing interim director Edwina Rogers who in 2013 had been director of the Secular Coalition for America when it and RDFRS formed a partnership. In 2016, following the merger of the RDFRS with the Center for Inquiry, Blumner took over from Ronald A. Lindsay as CEO and president of CFI, a position which Hemant Mehta speculated would make her ‚Äúone of the most powerful women in the world of organized atheism.‚Äù Blumner regularly speaks at science education, secular and atheist conferences including CSICon, Reason Rally, Apostacon and DLD. In 2016 Blumner, as president of the Center for Inquiry, championed a new global initiative called Secular Rescue which aims to protect and provide emergency support to non-believers, atheists and apostates, if necessary giving them an escape route from violence and death threats as well as diplomatic and legal assistance. \\"It‚Äôs really an underground railroad of sorts for non-believers in countries where simply expressing doubt about religious belief is a criminal offense or where it may lead to grave physical harm.\\" Blumner addressed the 36th Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on September 20, 2017 following a surge in discrimination against atheists in Malaysia, bringing pressure to bear on the issue of freedom of conscience. As of January 2018, Secular Rescue claims to have provided emergency aid to 30 individuals, including PEN Pinter Prize winning writer Ahmedur Rashid Chowdhury. Personal life Blumner describes herself as an atheist, a secularist and a liberal. She is married and lives in Washington DC.

It was released on February 3, 2017. Synesthesia is Courage My Love's second full-length album, the first being a re-release of a previous EP. The album combines the pop punk sound the band is known for, plus elements of synthwave and synthpop. The album was influenced by drummer Phoenix Arn-Horn self teaching herself synth programming.  Background  \\"Synesthesia is very much new age, with a mix of pop, punk, indie and dance\\" says Jared Allen of Volume Magazine. \\"These songs are all composed well.\\" said NewNoise. \\"They‚Äôre broad and diverse, creeping up on the necks of bands similar in style.

The interview states that, \\"Songwriting was done in two phases. The first lasted nearly two years before an initial recording session and the remainder of the album was developed from there. ‚ÄúWe knew going in that we didn‚Äôt want to rush anything (as much as we all wanted new music out ASAP),‚Äù Mercedes says. ‚ÄúWe knew that at this stage in our career this album was pretty much make or break. This would be the turning point. So we couldn‚Äôt allow any filler songs. That‚Äôs why the last five songs, especially, had to be above and beyond anything we‚Äôd done before. There was a lot of pressure, but sometimes pressure can lead to an amazing end result.‚Äù In an interview with AltPress, lead singer Mercedes Arn-Horn describes the album as \\"a story everyone can relate to. A heartbreak, a crisis of faith, and also the long struggle toward regaining your self-esteem and self-respect.

She is the founder and CEO of VIPKid, a 1-on-1 education online platform that pairs K-12 students with tutors in North America to learn English.  Early Life and Education  Mi was born in the province of Hebei, China. Mi grew up with a natural interest in education. As a child she was curious about the world outside of China, and would spend her lunch money on audio cassettes and magazines to teach herself English. At age 14 Mi moved to Harbin in north-eastern China. She experienced a new learning environment and was severely behind the rest of her new class in math. With many students in one class, the teacher was not able to pay attention to each student and explain concepts in detail and Mi could not fully understand the answers for questions. Mi found this as the problem in which the lessons were not personalized for students and students may be easy to lose confidence in the learning process. She continued to teach herself English, and by age 15 she began to tutor other students. By age 17, she dropped out of high school to co-found ABC English, a tutoring company, with her uncle, where she led business development and campus expansion across China. ABC English was a small company competing among large brick-and-mortar English language training institute. She did a little of everything to make the business run: sales, buying books, interviewing prospective teachers, teaching classes, grading homework. She worked early in the morning until 10 at night. When she finished the work from ABC English, she continued to work on her own studies until 2 a.m., eventually earning a bachelor's degree in English literature from Beijing Foreign Language University through China‚Äôs system of incredibly difficult self-taught exams. Later she got her MBA from the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business and attended Cornell Johnson Graduate School of Management in the US as an exchange student as well.  VIPKid  In the early 2000s, when the brick-and-mortar classrooms and private language schools were popular for English study, Mi realized that those classes were expensive and there was a lack of quality English teachers in some cities to match up with the high demand. With the problem Mi found earlier during her own education experience, she came up with the idea to connect fluent English-speaking teachers with young students for one-on-one 25-minute virtual tutoring lessons. The idea formed VIPKid. Mi set up the goal for VIPKid, which is to inspire confidence and self-expression in students. VIPKid is an online education technology company that connects K-12 students in China with teachers in North America for English tutoring. VIPKid was founded in 2013, has become one of China's leading education startups. Fee based English lessons are in the core subjects of math, science, social studies and other subjects. Mi has also implemented a free group seminar which includes lessons in social studies, art, science, music, and coding. VIPKid is now valued at more than $3 billion. It sees growth 40% month over month and receives investments from Northern Light Venture Capital, Innovation Works, Matrix Partners, Sequoia Capital, YF Capital, Learn Capital and Bryant Stibel. Mi has been successful in raising $500 million in financing. VIPKid now serves over 700,000 students from all of China's provinces, with over 100,000 teachers in the US and Canada. VIPKid is regularly featured in the Chinese media and has won accolades from technology giants like Tencent.

The site is in Serra Cross Park, a one-acre parcel within the larger Grant Park that overlooks downtown Ventura, the Santa Barbara Channel, and Anacapa and Santa Cruz Islands. According to some accounts, the first cross was erected at the site in 1782 at the time of the founding of the Mission San Buenaventura. The cross has been replaced several times, including known instances in the early 1860s under the supervision of Father John Campala, in 1912 by the E. C. O. Club, and in 1941 by the Alice M. Bartlett Club (successor to the E. C. O. Club). The site was designated as California Historical Landmark No. 113 in 1933; it was also designated in 1974 as City of Ventura Historical Landmark No. 5\\\\. In 2003, the threat of litigation over the city's use of public funds to maintain a religious symbol on city-owned land resulted in a settlement pursuant to which the city agreed to dim the lighting of the cross and sold a one-acre site underlying the cross to a private, non- profit organization that is now known as the Serra Cross Conservancy. History =Construction of the first cross= The Mission San Buenaventura was founded by Jun√≠pero Serra on March 30, 1782. According to E. M. Sheridan's \\"History of Cross On Hill\\", written in 1928, the erection of a cross at a highly visible point was \\"the first act of the Mission Fathers\\", seeking to establish a guide-post to those coming to the Mission by land or sea. According to Sheridan's account, Father Serra himself erected and blessed the cross on what was thereafter called \\"La Loma de la Cruz\\". According to the traditional story, the cross was erected even before the Mission itself was built. However, some contend that the story about Father Serra personally erecting the cross in 1782 is not factual. In his 1930 history, \\"San Buenaventura: The Mission by the Sea\\", Father Zephyrin Engelhardt rejected the traditional story: > \\"The first Cross was planted there, so the settlers will say, by Fr. > Junipero Serra, the founder of Mission San Buenaventura. However, that is an > error. When Fr. Serra started the Mission, he planted and blessed the Cross > on the spot where the altar of the church would be located. Such was the > rule for all occasions. He was not then in physical condition to climb to > the top of the hill, nor is there any record of the raising of the Cross on > the mount. Fr. Palou would surely have noted the incident.\\" Engelhardt was unable to ascertain precisely when the first cross was raised on the hill. =Father John Campala's cross= The first cross became decayed and collapsed, reportedly in the early 1860s. Shortly thereafter, the cross was rebuilt under the supervision of Father John Campala, also known as Padre Juan, who was then the presiding priest at the Mission San Buenaventura. The second cross collapsed in a windstorm on November 2, 1875. An article published four days later in the Ventura Free Press noted: \\"Fallenthe wooden cross, which stood on the summit of the hill back of town, after having stood the storms of a decade, succumbed to the elements on Tuesday night and fell. A cross placed on the same spot when the Mission was founded, and the emblem of Christianity has always been replaced whenever it fell.\\" For more than 35 years after Father John Campala's cross collapsed, no cross was erected at the site. After the 1875 storm, Ventura de Arnaz, then approximately 16 years old, climbed the hill with her father to survey the damage. The girl retrieved the headpiece from the cross, the portion bearing the inscription \\"INRI\\",\\"INRI\\" is the Latin abbreviation nailed over Jesus during the crucification. It refers to the Latin phrase 'Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum' meaning 'Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews'. and retained it as a souvenir. Arnaz later donated the headpiece to the Ventura Pioneer Museum, predecessor to The Museum of Ventura County. According to Sheridan's account, the headpiece discovered by Arnaz had been attached to the cross with wooden pegs and was a remnant of the original cross erected by Father Serra in 1782. The headpiece remains \\"one of the prized possessions\\" of The Museum of Ventura County. =Reconstruction in 1912= In 1912, a movement to rebuild the cross on the hill was led by Myrtle Francis, head of the Landmarks Committee, Sol N. Sheridan, secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, and Alice Bartlett, head of the E. C. O. Club.The E. C. O. Club was a civic women's organization in Ventura named after Ella Comstock Orr. The club was later renamed the Alice Bartlett Club in Bartlett's honor. Sheridan led a party to cut down Jeffrey pine trees in Santa Paula canyon to build the new cross, and R. E. Brakey cut the trees and hauled them back to Ventura. The logs were hewn and cured at the Peoples' Lumber Company under the supervision of Selwyn Shaw, a local builder who also designed the mount for the new cross. On September 9, 1912, the new cross was erected on the site of Father Serra's original cross. The 26-foot replacement cross was dedicated in a ceremony that included a live band and speeches. The Ventura Free Press described the ceremony at length on its front page and concluded: \\"Never has the town seen such an outpouring of people. The event was an unusual one for any community. It has never happened before, nor anything just like it, nor, is it likely to happen again within the next hundred years.\\" The ceremony began at the Mission with the ringing of the old Mission bells, including a vesper bell that had been silent for years. A procession up the hill, accompanied by Santa Barbara's St. Aloysius Band, was led by grand marshal, Francisco Camarillo, followed by the Franciscan fathers of Santa Barbara, E. C. O. Club members, Ventura County Pioneers, Native Daughters of the Golden West, city and county officials, and school children from throughout the county \\"carrying an immense American flag.\\" A large crowd of 3,000 to 4,000 persons gathered at the site of the cross for its dedication. Upon the raising of the cross, the Franciscans blessed it, and children from Oxnard's St. Joseph school sang. Several speeches were given, and an original poem about the cross was read by John S. McGroarty, who was later designated as California'a poet laureate. In 1915, residents of Ventura began an annual tradition of walking up the hill to the cross for an Easter sunrise service. In 1919, petitions were circulated seeking construction of a road to the cross through Grant Park. On April 3, 1932, a crowd of 5,000 persons gathered at the cross to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Father Serra's founding of the mission; after a procession from the Mission, an American flag was presented to the city, mass was celebrated by John Joseph Cantwell (the first archbishop of Los Angeles), choirs sang, an original poem was read by John S. McGroarty, and a speech was given by John G. Mott. Also in 1932, the cross was illuminated for the first time. An article in the Los Angeles Times opined: \\"The red outline makes a striking image on the hillside.\\" =The fourth cross erected in 1941= In 1941, the cross was replaced by the Alice M. Bartlett Club. In 1966, the cross was placed on a platform and illuminated with fluorescent lighting. In 1974, the cross site was one of the first six locations named as a City of Ventura Historic Landmark. It was designated as Ventura Historic Landmark No. 5. First Amendment litigation At least as early as 1991, concerns were raised about the City's maintenance of a Christian cross on public land. Two other Christian crosses in San Diego County were ordered removed that year (one on Mount Soledad in San Diego, the other on Mount Helix in La Mesa) by a federal judge who ruled that they violated the \\"no-preference\\" clause in the California Constitution. In March 2003, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and three Ventura County residents represented by attorney Vince Chhabria challenged the City of Ventura's use of public funds to maintain a religious symbol on public land. The action was premised on the First Amendment's Establishment Clause and followed lawsuits challenging crosses in San Francisco and La Mesa and Mount Soledad in San Diego County. Ventura's City Attorney Bob Boehm attempted to assert that, more than a religious icon, the Serra Cross was \\"a time-honored landmark\\" with a historic character. The debate over removal of the cross dominated Ventura County newspaper coverage and editorials through the spring and summer of 2003.See \\"Cross on the Hill\\" clippings file at The Museum of Ventura County containing some 70 articles, editorials and letters to the editor published between March and August 2003. On May 4, parishioners from 10 churches encircled the cross in a two-hour prayer vigil in support of the cross. On June 8, a group called Bikers for Christ held a Saturday morning rally in front of City Hall to support the maintenance of the cross. In August 2003, the City, seeking to avoid costly litigation and likely defeat, reached a settlement with the plaintiffs. As part of the settlement, the City agreed to sell the cross and a one-acre parcel beneath it in an auction open to all bidders. The settlement further required the City to cease illuminating the cross at night with fluorescent lighting and imposed a deed restriction that any future lighting was limited to more muted ground lighting. The settlement was approved by the Ventura City Council on a 6-to-1 vote with Councilman Neil Andrews contending that the restrictions on future owners were \\"capricious\\" and part of an effort \\"to strip public life of religion.\\" Descendants of the Grant family, which had donated the land to the City in 1918, filed suit challenging the City's planned sale of a portion of the property and arguing that the property would revert to the heirs if the sale went forward. That suit was defeated in court. The Serra Cross Conservancy The cross at Serra Cross Park, 2013 In September 2003, a non-profit historic preservation group, San Buenaventura Heritage, purchased the cross and the one-acre site for $104,216.87. The group was the high bidder in an auction that drew four other bidders. At the time of the acquisition, one of the group's leaders, Christie Weir, said the cross would remain, noted that the organization included members of various faiths, and described the cross as a symbol of Ventura's mission heritage. A new group, Serra Cross Conservancy, was formed, and the property was transferred to it. This group maintains the site as a public park known as Father Serra Park. According to the Conservancy's web site, the group is \\"interested in preserving and maintaining the Serra Cross Park for a variety of personal reasons; we value the Park for the sake of historic preservation and/or are interested in the cross as a religious icon and a landmark attraction to other communities and tourists. But mostly for long- time members of this community, the cross represents what makes Ventura special and serves as an important element of our lives here in Ventura.\\" Serra Cross Park is known for its sweeping views of Ventura, the Santa Barbara Channel, and Anacapa and Santa Cruz Islands. The conservancy leases the location for weddings and other events. In December 2017, rumors that the Serra Cross had been destroyed in the Thomas Fire proved unfounded, though portions of the surrounding park were burned in the fire.

It was discovered on 27 February 1998, by astronomers with the ODAS survey conducted at the CERGA Observatory near Caussols, France. The presumed C-type asteroid has a short rotation period of 3.34 hours. It was named for American soprano Ren√©e Fleming.  Orbit and classification  Ren√©efleming is a non- family asteroid from the main belt's background population, and a member of the small group of Zhongguo asteroids, located in the Hecuba gap and locked in a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the gas giant Jupiter. Contrary to the nearby Griqua group, the orbits of the Zhongguos are stable over half a billion years. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.4‚Äì4.1 AU once every 5 years and 10 months (2,137 days; semi-major axis of 3.25 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.27 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first observations at Mount Wilson Observatory in April 1934, almost 64 years prior to its official discovery observation at Caussols.  Physical characteristics  Ren√©efleming is an assumed C-type asteroid, which agrees with the body's albedo (see below). = Rotation period = In December 2014, a rotational lightcurve of Ren√©efleming was obtained from photometric observations in the R-band by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a short rotation period of 3.34 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.12 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Ren√©efleming measures 6.973 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.053, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 6.08 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 14.81.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) on 30 November 2001, after its orbit had sufficiently been secured (). It was named after American soprano Ren√©e Fleming (born 1959) known for her roles in classical operas by Richard Strauss, Mozart, Handel, Verdi and Dvorak, as well as more modern pieces. The official naming citation was published by the MPC on 29 May 2018 ().

Biography  Patricio Jara grew up in Antofagasta and studied at the Jesuit Colegio San Luis, where he wrote his first stories. Later he entered , where he qualified as a journalist in 1996. In his time as a university student he won his first prizes. He worked at his alma mater and was coordinator of the literature program when it became the . As a professor Jara has taught at various higher education establishments, such as (Antofagasta campus), Diego Portales University (UDP) in Santiago, and Finis Terrae University (UFT). His articles have appeared in various media such as the Revista de Libros and S√°bado (both of El Mercurio), Qu√© Pasa, and The Clinic. An extreme rock fan, he has published chronicles in Rolling Stone and written a kind of personal history of national metal music, as well as a biography of the Chilean death/thrash metal band Pentagram. Since 2004 he has lived in Santiago, in the neighborhood of √ëu√±oa, near the National Stadium, where he attends football matches. His love for this sport has been reflected in \\"Marihuana √Ålvarez\\", which was part of Gente que va al estadio (1997, with a foreword by Hern√°n Rivera Letelier), a book that also includes stories by two other journalists. In addition to teaching at UDP, he is an editor for Ediciones B. He is married and has two daughters.  Literary career  The first book published by Jara was a compilation of his stories, √öltima ronda, which appeared in Antofagasta in 1996. Although he has continued to work in the short fiction genre, it is with his novels that he has achieved notoriety. In the first of these, he did not go far from the story, because it was a short novel destined for the youth audience, Ave satani (1999), which, reissued by Alfaguara in 2004, became ', and which reflects Jara's love for heavy metal. His consecration in Chile came in 2002, when he won the award of the National Book and Reading Council for best unpublished novel of the year with El sangrado. It was at that time that the magazine Qu√© Pasa included him, together with Marcelo Simonetti and , in \\"the trio of the country's literary renewal\\", and Hern√°n Rivera Letelier wrote about Jara: \\"He always showed himself to be a literary animal. He eats, dreams, and fornicates literature. I see him as the leader of the nortina squad, holding strong in Santiago.\\" His subsequent novels include, Prat (a fictional story of the naval hero Arturo Prat), Quemar un pueblo (2009), and Geolog√≠a de un planeta desierto (2013). The latter, praised by critics, contains autobiographical material of the relationship with his father (who died in 1998, \\"after a hard decade of alcoholism\\"), which was reflected in the evolution of the title. Jara called it first G√©ologo, then Novela de pap√°, and finally Geolog√≠a... As for the influences on this work, he recognizes that of Michel Houellebecq, an author who \\"appears as a character at the end of the novel.\\" Jara's writing process is usually long, and sometimes takes years from the idea for a novel to the end.

She has been a leader of protests that began in 2014 against the proposed development of an inter-oceanic canal through Nicaragua and for the repeal of the 2013 legislation (Law 840) granting Chinese company HKND the concession for the canal and other infrastructure projects.  Early life  Francisca Ram√≠rez T√≥rrez was born in 1977 in a small rural community then known as Somoza in Nueva Guinea on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua (following the revolution, Somoza was renamed La Fonseca in 1979 in honor of Sandinista leader Carlos Fonseca.) Ram√≠rez's family was originally from the Pacific coast of Nicaragua but had been displaced in the 1950s in a Somozas regime program of relocating farmers with small orchards in the region to make way for burgeoning cotton crops. These farmers, including Ram√≠rez's family, were moved to so-called \\"colonies\\" on the Caribbean coast, at the time virgin forest. Ram√≠rez's parents had five children, but her father left during the war when she was seven years old, after which she was charged with helping her mother raise her siblings. She left school after the third grade and at 12 she began traveling to Managua to sell crops for local farmers.  Activism  Ram√≠rez now owns her own land in La Fonseca, as well as a small fleet of trucks with which she and her husband and children transport crops. Like her neighbors in the rural community, Ram√≠rez's family is economically dependent on the land they farm and became alarmed when Chinese surveyors arrived without notice to begin measuring their land for canal development. Ram√≠rez began organizing a response when she learned they were at risk of being displaced by the land expropriation Law 840 authorized in granting Chinese company HKND the concession for the proposed inter-oceanic canal and other infrastructure projects. As part of this organizing, Ram√≠rez served as head of the environmental and peasants rights organization, the National Council for the Defense of the Land, Lake and Sovereignty (Consejo Nacional para la Defensa de la Tierra, Lago y Soberan√≠a). Per its bylaws, the Council for the Defense of the Land functions as a non-partisan and self-mobilized grassroots movement, independent of political party or NGO affiliation, and Ram√≠rez personally does not belong to a political party; she has refused offers of office in exchange for joining a party. She has also declined to participate in closed-door meetings with President Daniel Ortega, and turned down high-priced buyouts for her land offered in exchange for ceasing her activism. In December 2016, Nicaraguan National Police seized two of Ram√≠rez's work vehicles. In the April 2018 protests in Nicaragua, Ram√≠rez with other leaders of the peasants movement issued a statement of support for the youth and self-organized grassroots protesters and called for a general strike. Recognition In 2016, Forbes Mexico named Ram√≠rez one of the 50 most powerful women in Central America. In 2017, Ram√≠rez was a runner up for the Front Line Defenders award for human rights defenders.

Henry Grizzard was hanged by a white mob on April 24 near the house of the young women in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. Ephraim and another brother, John Grizzard, had been arrested and taken to jail in Nashville, along with two other suspects. John Grizzard and another detainee were released because there was no evidence that they had been involved in the alleged assaults. However, on April 30, a white mob estimated to number as many as 10,000 overpowered the police guards and took Ephraim Grizzard from the jail. He was dragged through the streets to the Woodland Street Bridge, where he was hanged. Members of the mob then shot his dead body more than two hundred times. In June 2017 Ephraim Grizzard's memory was honored with a church service at Fisk University and a plaque was dedicated at St. Anselm's Episcopal Church in Nashville. An historical commemoration was planned for a week in June 2019 by \\"We Remember Nashville\\" and the Equal Justice Initiative to acknowledge the Grizzard brothers and two victims of an earlier lynching in Nashville. Lynching In April 1892, Mollie and Rosina Bruce, two daughters of the Bruce family in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, were reportedly assaulted by several African-Americans. They were the daughters of the late Lee Bruce, a veteran of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. The Bruce daughters lived in Goodlettsville with their widowed mother, who served as a tollkeeper, and younger siblings. Henry Grizzard was caught first and reportedly confessed, implicating another man named Mack Harper. Grizzard was quickly hanged by a mob at 10 AM on April 28, 1892 near Goodlettsville, which spans Davidson and Sumner counties. His brothers John and Ephraim Grizzard were both arrested and jailed as suspects in Nashville, the county seat of Davidson County. Mack Harper and Manuel Jones were also arrested, but the police soon released John Grizzard and Jones for lack of evidence. The two Bruce girls did not make a positive identification of Grizzard and Harper as their assailants. At 10 p.m. on April 29, 1892, a mob of 300 white men from Goodlettsville went to the Nashville jail to try to take Ephraim Grizzard from jail for lynching. Governor John P. Buchanan and Adjutant General Norman went to the jail a little before 2 a.m. A shooting occurred at 2:25 a.m.; the mob fired gunshots from outside and the police shot back from inside the building. Two white men, Charles Rear and N.D. Guthrie, were mortally wounded and died. At 2:45 a.m., Governor Buchanan asked the mob to let Grizzard be tried in a court of law. The mob dispersed shortly before 5 a.m. At 2 p.m. on April 30, 1892, a mob of 6,000 men from 20 towns gathered in Nashville. A \\"wealthy merchant\\" from Goodlettsville gave a speech in front of the crowd, which had grown to 10,000. The mob returned to the Nashville jail, where they took Grizzard out of his cell. He was \\"dragged through the streets in broad daylight\\", and taken to the east side of the Woodland Street Bridge over the Cumberland River (near the modern-day Nissan Stadium). Grizzard was hanged and shot to death. Riddled with bullets, he was shot 200 times. His corpse was taken back to Goodlettsville, shown to the Bruce family, and burned. A fund was set up for the Bruce family by The Daily American on May 1, 1892. One of the donors was Edmund William Cole, the president of the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway. Civil rights activist Ida B. Wells investigated the lynching. She found that Ephrain Grizzard allegedly had visited one of the Bruce daughters. Wells maintains that Grizzard was punished for this interracial contact, rather than an actual assault on the daughter. She noted that a white man who was then in jail charged with raping an eight- year-old black girl was not harmed by the mob.Diane Miller Sommerville, Rape & Race in the Nineteenth-century South, Univ of North Carolina Press, 2004, p. 253 She described Grizzard's murder as \\"A naked, bloody example of the blood- thirstiness of the nineteenth century civilization of the Athens of the South.\\" She added, \\"No cannon nor military were called out in his defence.\\" On May 2, 1892, African Americans in Triune reportedly killed at least three white resident as retaliation for the Grizzard lynching. Legacy In June 2017, the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee Task Force on Anti-Racism and Lipscomb University's Christian Scholars' Conference organized a service, held in honor of the 1892 lynching victim Ephraim Grizzard, at the Fisk University Memorial Chapel. It was followed by the dedication of a plaque in his memory in the St. Anselm's Episcopal Church in Nashville. This historic plaque also honors the memory of two other lynching victims: his brother Henry Grizzard, and Samuel Smith of Nolensville, Tennessee, who was killed in relation to another incident. The Grizzard brothers and Smith were three of the six blacks documented as lynched in Davidson County in the post-Reconstruction period.Lynching in America/Summary by County (3rd edition) , p. 9, Equal Justice Initiative, 2017, Montgomery, Alabama According to Natasha Deane, who researched the article for St. Anselm's website on the history of the lynchings and memorial marker, issues of the Nashville Banner from the days immediately following the report of Grizzard's lynching are missing from the archive at the Nashville Public Library. In May 2019, the Metropolitan Nashville Davidson County Community Remembrance Project (We Remember Nashville) announced its plans together with the Equal Justice Initiative to conduct several days of remembrance and education to mark the local history of lynchings of black men. Brothers Ephraim and Henry Grizzard, killed on April 30 and 24, 1892, respectively, were to be recognized with a historical marker in downtown Nashville. A second marker will be installed downtown to recognize David Jones and Jo Reed, black men who were lynched during Reconstruction, in 1872 and 1875, respectively. The year 1877 marked the withdrawal of federal troops from the South at the end of the Reconstruction era and a rise in violence of whites against blacks into the early 20th century.

It was discovered on 24 October 2000, by astronomers with Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States. The likely elongated C-type asteroid has a rotation period of 19.20 hours.  Orbit and classification  is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population, and a member of the small group of Zhongguo asteroids, located in the Hecuba gap and locked in a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the gas giant Jupiter. Contrary to the nearby unstable Griqua group, the orbits of the Zhongguos are stable over half a billion years. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.5‚Äì4.1 AU once every 6.04 years (2,206 days; semi-major axis of 3.32 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 0¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by Spacewatch in February 1996, more than 4 years prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro.  Physical characteristics  has been characterized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS large-scale survey. = Rotation period = In January 2014, a rotational lightcurve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations in the R-band by astronomers at the Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 19.20 hours with a high brightness amplitude of 0.70 magnitude, indicative of an elongated shape (). = Diameter and albedo = The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 4.87 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 15.29.

According to Gunther Schmidt and Thomas Str√∂hlein, \\"Alfred Tarski and Jacques Riguet founded the modern \\"calculus of relations\\". Career Already at his lyc√©e, Riguet was impressed by the power of geometric reasoning. He studied Louis Couturat and Bourbaki, who made contributions to logic and set theory.Stephane Dugowson and others Hommage a Jacques Riguet at Google Sites Riguet studied higher mathematics with Albert Ch√¢telet and was introduced to lattices. In 1948 he published \\"Relations binaires, fermetures, correspondances de Galois\\"Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Math√©matique de France 76: 114‚Äì55 which revived the calculus of binary relations. He published his thesis Fondements de la Theorie de Relations Binaires in October 1951. In 1954 Riguet gave a plenary address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Amsterdam, speaking on the applications of binary relations to algebra and machine theory. For a time, Riguet attended the seminary of Jacques Lacan. Riguet was employed at Centre national de la recherche scientifique until 1957. Relations In Riguet's work the composition of relations is the basis for characterizing relations, replacing the element-wise descriptions that use logical formulations. For example, he described the Schr√∂der rules. His work was reviewed in Journal of Symbolic Logic by √òystein Ore.Journal of Symbolic Logic 16(1): 61 Some of Riguet‚Äôs contributions can be described using structure of the logical matrix associated with a relation. If u and v are logical vectors, then their logical outer product produces the associated logical matrix u_i \\\\land v_j . Riguet calls the associated relation a rectangular relation, and if it happens to be symmetric it is a square relation. In 1950 he submitted \\"Sur les ensembles reguliers de relations binaires\\",Comptes Rendus 231: 936,7 and an article on difunctional relations, those with logical matrix in a block diagonal form.J. Riguet (1950) \\"Quelques proprietes des relations difonctionelles\\", Comptes Rendus 230: 1999‚Äì2000 The following year he provided an algebraic characterization of heterogeneous relations with a logical matrix comparable to a Ferrers diagram.\\"Les relations de Ferrers\\", Comptes Rendus 232: 1729,30 Since Ferrers diagrams order the partition of an integer, Riguet extended order theory beyond relations restricted to one set.

Pucheta is the first woman to occupy the Vice Presidency of Paraguay. Vice President of Paraguay In 11 April 2018, the Vice President of Paraguay Juan Afara left the Vice Presidency to run as a Senator in the 2018 general election. Pucheta was nominated by the President of Paraguay Horacio Cartes to replace Afara as Vice President of Paraguay later that month. At the time of her nomination, Pucheta was a Justice in the Supreme Court of Justice of Paraguay; she resigned from the position on 30 April. Pucheta's nomination was criticized by reports that considered the designation as an award to Pucheta for having, as a member of the Supreme Court, allowed Cartes' candidacy to the Senate in the 2018 general election, even though it was not allowed by the Constitution. She assumed the position on 9 May 2018; she became the first woman to occupy the Vice Presidency of Paraguay. President Cartes affirmed that he would resign from the Presidency before the end of his tenure on 15 August 2018 to take up a Senate seat, in which case Pucheta would have become the first woman to be President of Paraguay, and also the first woman to become Vice President and President without having been elected by popular vote. However, Cartes withdrew his resignation request on 26 June 2018, after his resignation was not voted by Congress. Personal life Pucheta is the daughter of Justo Pucheta Ortega and Beatriz Valoriani. Her father was also a musician; he was part of a musical duo who recorded the first album of Paraguayan music in 1926. After the Chaco War, he went to Pilar as a criminal judge, where he met Pucheta's mother. Once married, they set up residence in Asunci√≥n. Pucheta was married to a colleague of her, to the lawyer Carlos Alberto Correa Vera. She is the mother of two sons: Hugo Armando, who followed his parents' footsteps, and Luis Arturo, who chose a career in medicine. Correa Vera died on 30 June 2016.

Its length is about nine kilometres (approximately 5.5 mi). The road runs near places such as Pratunam Intersection, Pantip Plaza, Platinum Fashion Mall, Embassy of The Republic of Indonesia, Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), and Saint Dominic School.

Born in Bristol, Hampton attended Ruskin College in Oxford, receiving a Diploma of Economics and Political Science accredited by the University of Oxford. He became involved in the co-operative movement, and served as the chairman of Co-operative Builders, based in Birmingham. While there, he became politically active with the Co-operative Party. In 1919, Hampton was one of the first three Co-operative Party candidates elected to Birmingham City Council, winning the Balsall Heath ward, holding the seat for three years. The Co- operative Party soon allied with the Labour Party, and in 1921/22, Hampton was secretary of the Birmingham Labour Party group. He stood as a joint Labour Co- operative candidate in Birmingham Sparkbrook at the 1922 United Kingdom general election, taking third place with 23.4% of the vote. In the 1923 United Kingdom general election, he stood again, but this time as a Labour Party candidate, sponsored by the National Union of Clerks. He improved his vote share slightly, to 24.6%, and moved up to second place. In 1928, Hampton wrote a history of co-operation in Birmingham. He became the area organiser for the co-operative movement, but he moved away from the district in 1930.

Gordon (Russian: –ì–æ—Ä–¥–æ–Ω, –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á) is a Russian historian, historiographer, socio-anthropologist, and culturologist. He is the author of important works on European history, modern civilization, peasant studies, historiography. His major areas of research are the history and historiography of French revolution, mass-movements in traditional and modern cultures, and peasant culture. Through his work at the Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences, he has considerably affected the exchange of information between Western and Russian academies and societies. He also authored several popular books on history and culture. Early life and education Alexander V. Gordon was born in Dnepropetrovsk (USSR, currently in Ukraine) in 1937, in the family of a military engineer. The family moved to Slonim (USSR, currently in Belarus), where Gordon graduated from high school in 1954. Gordon had successfully passed difficult entrance exams and was admitted to the Department of History at Saint Petersburg State University. He graduated in 1959, majoring in history, with the specialist diploma (equivalent of Bachelor of Arts). His development as an historian was influenced by such Soviet historians as S.N.Valk, Ya.M.Zacher, and E.E.Pechuro. He spent next three years at an obligatory position as a school history teacher in Kaliningrad (in Moscow region) Academic career =Writing and research= Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 1961-currently Upon finishing his work term as a school teacher, Gordon obtained a junior researcher position the Fundamental Library for Social Sciences (in Russian, –§—É–Ω–¥–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –ë–∏–±–ª–∏–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∞ –ø–æ –û–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º –ù–∞—É–∫–∞–º, –§–ë–û–ù or FBON) a special research body of the Academy of the Sciences of the USSR. It was a closed-for-the-public library of the Academy, which doubled as a research think-tank, studying Western humanities and social sciences. In the 1968, this library was incorporated into the INION, and started publishing various research materials. Gordon has been working there since 1961, raising from the position of junior researcher to the top position of head researcher and the head of the Asian and African Countries Division. He published his memoirs about his work there. At this time, most modern foreign literature in the humanities was inaccessible even to scholars in the Soviet Union. It was considered to be propaganda, or distorted description of reality, promoting capitalist ideas. While the most important foreign books were acquired by a selected few major Soviet libraries, including FBON, they were often placed into special storage, and \\"access to materials from Special Storage was conditional on special permission: a person had to either have the corresponding level of security access or to have a written permission from the First Department from person's job.\\" (Spetskhran). Very limited number of scholars were able to obtain permission to work at the Fundamental Library for Social Sciences, and even of those, many had poor command of foreign languages. One of paradoxal phenomena of the Soviet scientific landscape of that time were so-called \\"review collections of INION\\", which contained Russian-language analytical reviews of the freshest crop of the Western thought. The system, on one side, was barring scholars from first-hand access to foreign literature, on the other side, it fed to them the essence of the latest Western ideas in Russian language. Naturally, most of these collection carried \\"confidential\\" note of them, so they were a part of Spetskhran. However, some of the scholars, who got access to these \\"confidential\\" titles, allowed to copy them, which brought to life of sub-culture of scholarly Samizdat. These Samizdat \\"review collections\\" enjoyed great popularity in scholar circles, and hugely affected development of Soviet humanities, against the will of ideological hardliners. Some of most popular authors of these analytical reviews became \\"scholarly stars\\" in the USSR, having a cult-like following; especially, outside of Moscow, where original texts were practically inaccessible. Alexander V.Gordon has been one of those stars. Writing analytical reviews is a scholarly art in itself; it required even more effort in Soviet times, when authors could not directly praise Western theorists or ideas. They had to review them, looking through the glasses of marxist ideology. Many of reviewers, including Gordon, themselves shared at least some flavour of that ideology, and this simplified their task. However, even under the guise of marxist critique, they managed to convey to readers the gist of modern Western thought. It was often up to the reviewers to select books from recent acquisitions; therefore, their choices were indirectly forming general conceptual landscape of the humanities in the USSR in the 60s-80s of the last century. Beside stand-alone reviews, published as books (and considered to be academical works in their own right), there were special review journals, published on bi-monthly basis, and containing shorter reviews of important works. The division of INION, where Gordon worked, and whose head he eventually became, was responsible for publishing one of these journals, devoted to research on Asian and African countries. The situation changed after the crash of the USSR and ensuing economical chaos, when inflow of Western literature almost stopped due to lack of funds. It changed again with advent of the internet that provided online direct access to Western academia. However, it did not eliminate production of analytical reviews, which now are playing their proper role as a bridge of ideas between Russian and Western academia. Gordon produced a few important analytical books over this period. Post-graduate studies at the Institute of History, the Academy of the Sciences of the USSR, 1961-1965 In 1961, a prominent Soviet historian and anthropologist, Boris Porshnev has encouraged Gordon to apply for a part-time post-graduate student position at the Institute of History (later - Institute of World History) of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, in Moscow. At this time, his main interest was French history, and especially, the period of French Revolution. He wrote his dissertation on the subject of \\"Establishing of the Montagnard rule\\", under guidance of Albert Manfred and Victor Dalin, and defended it in 1968 at the Institute. Turn to mass- movements in research direction, 1968-1977 Defending a dissertation on French history did not bring a relevant research position at the Institute of History. At this time, Gordon was encouraged by his manager at the Asian ad African Countries Division at the INION to continue his research of critical moments in mass-movements in the third-world area. Gordon was attracted by teachings of the prominent figure in anti-colonial and national liberation movement of 1960s, Frantz Fanon. As a result, he wrote a book that presented to Russian-speaking community the new wave of revolutionary thinking. The book on Fanon became a hit in left-leaning circles of young Soviet intelligentsia. Under the guise of extolling anti-colonial marxist hero, this book introduced into Soviet ideological landscape fresh new left ideas, adding more cracks to already damaged, after Khrushchev Thaw, ideological armor of Party hardliners. Turning to studying Third-world mass-movements did not mean, though, that Gordon completely abandoned French history. He continued working on French historiography, and later returned to France with a new research interest in peasant studies. As well, he published books of popular interest on French history. Peasant Studies, 1977-currently Proclaiming himself a Marxist, Fanon, acting in Third-world countries, which were missing large bodies of revolutionary proletariat, was looking for another class that could act as the Marxist \\"subject of revolution\\". Probably following Mao Zedong, who discovered \\"revolutionary potential in peasantry\\" in 1920s, he proclaimed peasantry a revolutionary factor in national liberation and anti-colonial movements. Gordon started research in this direction, and this led him to peasant studies (see The Journal of Peasant Studies) and, eventually, switching from Marxist's paradigm to civilizational one, following steps of Arnold J. Toynbee and later Samuel P. Huntington. He was mostly inspired by ideas and anthropological field studies of such American researchers, as John Embree. In the Soviet ideological landscape, he was pioneering the idea of peasantry as a \\"subject of history\\", which brought a lot of critiques both from left and right camps. Gordon's studies led to defending his second doctorate of Doktor Nauk, titled \\"The Asian Peasantry: Historical subject, cultural tradition, and social community\\", at the Institute of Asian and African Countries in Moscow, as well to publishing a few monographs. =Teaching and lecturing= 2007-2008 - lectures at Russian State University for the Humanities: \\"French Historical Tradition\\" =Memoirs= Alexander Gordon recently published a few scholarly memoirs, initially, \\"–§–ë–û–ù-–ò–ù–ò–û–ù. –í–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ –ø–æ—Ä—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—ã. –í—ã–ø. 2\\" (\\"Fundamental Library of the Russian Academy of Sciencies: Memoirs and Portraits of my colleagues\\", in Russian) in 2017 and then \\"–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∫–∏ –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–µ–∫–∞\\" (\\"Historians of the Iron Age\\", in Russian) in 2018.

While the term's precise meaning is difficult to define, 'Iowa nice' as a concept has been touched upon by both national publications such as The Huffington Post and Iowan publications such as The Gazette and The Quad City Times. It can be analogized to the similar notions of Minnesota nice and Southern hospitality. Background and additional details While without a strict definition, Iowa nice is seen to generally mean actions such as pulling over to a roadside to help somebody else with vehicle troubles (i.e. changing a tire). The term also gets applied to a general atmosphere of social toleration in which the discrimination and prejudice more accepted in other places of the U.S. is absent or downplayed, a specific example being how the Des Moines Human Rights Commission came into being in 1951 compared to the national agencies promoted over a decade later by Lyndon B. Johnson and created through the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Social commentators such as Eric Scott of The Huffington Post have stated that the concept's limits deserve more attention even as its positive sides remain strong. He wrote in 2017 that Iowa nice has \\"led to complacency and an expectation that issues needing to be addressed will be handled by our local leaders.\\" Writing for The Gazette, a publication based out of Cedar Rapids, Rev. Mel Schlachter of Iowa City has argued that while \\"conflict avoidance can be a downside\\" of the state ethos and needed confrontations can get put aside, the concept still results in an atmosphere of \\"hospitality and cordiality all the way\\" through society that enhances the quality of life. During the 2018 student walk-outs and social protests over gun violence, multiple students in the Des Moines area demonstrated using slogans that they were \\"done being Iowa nice\\". In statistical terms, a national study published in the scholarly journal Perspectives on Psychological Science by researchers Peter Rentfrow, Samuel Gosling, and Jeff Potter in 2008 analyzed personality traits of individuals in different parts of the U.S. The scholars found that Iowans scored as the fifteenth most agreeable and fifteenth most extraverted Americans compared to those of the other fifty states. Related concepts It can be analogized to the similar notions of Minnesota nice and Southern hospitality. Iowa's neighboring state of Nebraska adopted \\"Nebraska nice\\" as a tourism slogan in 2018, after several decades of its use in reference to Nebraska's stadium having a reputation as having the \\"nicest fans in college football.\\"https://www.3newsnow.com/news/local-news/nebraska-has-a-new-tourism- slogan The concept of a Seattle Freeze can function as a kind of antonym.

It was released in the United States and Canada on July 27, 2018 by IFC Midnight and Elevation Pictures.  Plot  Ethan returns home from college to visit his parents and younger siblings, Becca and Matt. A passionate inventor, he leaves early to conduct an on-campus experiment, but promises his disappointed parents he'll prioritise the family on his next break. Ethan has invented a machine called 'Eli' that is designed to create wireless electrical power. However, as his project lacks university authorization, Ethan, his girlfriend Hannah, and another friend must sneak into the university lab to perform his experiments with it. When they activate the device, they fail to notice a black, smoky mass emanating from the equipment. The trial causes a campus-wide blackout, and the trio flee. The next morning, Ethan learns that his parents have died, and he returns home to care for Becca and Matt. He begins a part- time job, and continues to work on Eli in his spare time. After he performs further experiments, strange things begin to occur through the house. The siblings come to believe that Ethan's machine is allowing their mother to make contact with them. When a supernatural entity appears, it tells them that the machine is harnessing spiritual energy, and that increasing its power will allow both of their parents to appear. Ethan enlists the help of his neighbour, Tom, a widower, to illegally tap into the street's power supply. Becca claims to have given her doll away to comfort a new friend, Alice, who fears a man named Henry. The supernatural events increase and become menacing. Tom begins to exhibit odd behaviour, warning Ethan that the machine's effect has expanded beyond the house. Hannah views footage of the first experiment and shows Ethan a ghostly, female silhouette, and they ask an elderly neighbour, Marie, about the house's previous occupants. Marie tells them about Alice, a child who disappeared from the house, whom Marie thinks was killed by Henry, her foster father. Becca is lured into the basement by the doll and dragged into a large chest. Ethan informs Matt that the ghosts are not their parents, and Hannah and Matt look for Becca while Ethan goes to switch Eli off. However, he finds that Tom has taken the machine to communicate with his wife's spirit, Ethan breaks in to Tom's house and a fight ensues. Matt and Hannah find Becca in a hidden underground room, but all three are overcome by murderous ghosts. After Ethan explains that the spirit isn't his wife, Tom releases him. The ghost then turns on Tom and drags him away. Ethan smashes the machine with a baseball bat, saving his family. As the siblings prepare to move to a new home, Becca is given the doll she'd intentionally left in the house to keep Alice company. She races in to return it before they leave. The final scene is that of a happy and loving family unit, with Ethan and Hannah now assuming the parental roles for Matt and Becca. However, there is ominous music, and we see the doll peeking out from inside a packing box.

It has a rosette of leaves at its base and up to fifteen green, insect-like flowers with dark reddish brown glands on its labellum. Description Arthrochilus oreophilus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber that produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. It has a rosette of between two and five lance-shaped leaves at its base, each leaf long and about wide. Between two and fifteen insect-like flowers long are borne on a fleshy, dark reddish brown flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is spatula-shaped to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, about wide, folded lengthwise and wrapped around the base of the column. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped but curved, long, about wide and turn downwards towards the ovary. The petals are linear, curved, about long, wide and turned backwards against the ovary. The labellum is about long and pale green with a dark purple base. There is an insect-like callus about long with dark reddish brown, hair-like glands in a central band on the labellum. The column is green with purplish spots, curved, about long with two curved wings above and below it. Flowering occurs from November to January. Taxonomy and naming Arthrochilus oreophilus was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Herberton. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (oreophilus) is derived from the Ancient Greek words oros meaning \\"mountain\\" or \\"hill\\" and philos meaning \\"beloved\\" or \\"dear\\", referring to the habitat preference of this orchid. Distribution and habitat The montane elbow orchid grows in woodland in forest on the ranges and tablelands at altitudes above between the Cedar Bay National Park and the Evelyn Tableland. It is most common on the Atherton Tableland. Ecology As with other Arthrochilus orchids, A. oreophilus is pollinated by male thynnid wasps of the genus Arthrothynnus although the species involved is not known. It also reproduces asexually by producing new tubers.

On June 15, 2016, Selectblinds.com CEO, Al Silverberg, spoke before the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission to request a new window covering mandate that requires all related retailers to be cord-free by the beginning of 2018. [Update: In 2017, the Window Covering Manufacturers Association (WCMA) proposed revising the voluntary standard to require ‚Äústock‚Äù products be cordless or have inaccessible cords. This would apply to pre-made blinds purchased in stores or online. (Corded blinds would still be available in custom products.) The updated voluntary standard awaits final approval, but the WCMA said companies selling window coverings in the U.S. and Canada will likely be required to comply by the fourth quarter of 2018.] In recognition of Selectblinds.com's decision to only sell cordless window coverings, Steele was given the 2016 Humanitarian Award from Harvard Business School's Business Expert Forum. Safe Kids Day ‚Äî SelectBlinds.com sponsored 2014's Safe Kids Day through Safe Kids Worldwide, giving away window blind cord cleats to all attendees.

The book was on the New York Times best-seller list in both the sports and civil rights categories for four consecutive months. It received the 2015 Lillian Smith Book Award and a Special Recognition Award by the Robert F. Kennedy Book Awards Foundation. Maraniss attended Vanderbilt University in 1992 on a Fred Russell-Grantland Rice Scholarship for Sports Journalism. He won the school's Charles Foster Alexander Award for excellence in journalism in 1992 and in 2016 was inducted in the Vanderbilt Student Media Hall of Fame. He was designated Vanderbilt's \\"Writer-in-Residence\\" in 2017. The popularity of the book reoriented his former career in public relations into that of full-time author. Maraniss' father, David Maraniss, is a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and associate editor for The Washington Post'. A family of writers Maraniss was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the son of David and Linda Maraniss who met there in high school. His grandfather, Elliott Maraniss, was editor of Madison's Capital Times newspaper in the 1970s. His grandmother, Mary Maraniss, was a 1966 graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Phi Beta Kappa, and book editor for the University of Wisconsin Press. Marannis' father, David, has been associate editor of The Washington Post' since 1977 and won a Pulitzer prize for national reporting in 1993 for his coverage of Bill Clinton's candidacy during the 1992 presidential election. The senior Maraniss said that his son Andrew \\"has always been more mature than Linda and I\\", a child who would save his candy rather than eat it all at once. When Andrew was young, his father was a budding journalist who found a job at the Trenton Times in New Jersey, that necessitated the family's move from Wisconsin to the east coast. In the 1970s another job opened up at The Washington Post so they moved to Washington, D.C. As a youth in the late 1970s, Andrew attended press conferences with his father. When Maraniss was in high school, his father was transferred to Austin, Texas, to serve as southwest bureau chief for the Post. Early life While in high school in Austin, Maraniss was sports editor for the school paper, the Austin High Maroon. He got a job writing sports articles as an intern for the Austin American‚ÄìStatesman. A poster at school about a college scholarship caught his attention and prompted him to submit his news clippings to apply for it. His writing won him a Fred Russell-Grantland Rice Sportswriting Scholarship to Vanderbilt University in 1988. Sportswriting Hall-of-Famer Fred Russell, for whom the sportswriting scholarship is named, took the four recipients out to lunch a couple of times a year and developed personal relationships with them. The tradition continued until Russell's death in 2003. Maraniss worked his way up to sports editor of the Hustler, the college newspaper. After graduation, he had a job as Vanderbilt basketball sports information director. Strong Inside In 1989, as a 19 year old student, he read an article in a student publication about Perry Wallace. One of his professors, Yolette Jones (associate dean in the College of Arts and Sciences as of 2017), suggested that he interview Wallace who was then a law professor in Baltimore. Maraniss did so, and wrote two papers about Wallace and some student newspaper articles. Maraniss recalled, \\"I remember sitting on the floor of my dormitory, scribbling in a notebook and feeling like the world was opening up to me as I talked to the most impressive person I had ever talked to before\\". After graduation Maraniss stayed on, working as associate director of media relations for Vanderbilt Athletics from 1992 to 1997. In 1998 he moved to Tampa, taking a job as Media Relations Manager for the inaugural season of the Tampa Bay Rays. He then returned to Nashville to join a public relations firm, McNeely, Pigott and Fox and became a partner there for 18 years. Maraniss knew he could write a book (his father had written ten of them) and he was looking for inspiration. At a family gathering he lamented not having a compelling subject to write about. Family members reminded him of his articles about Perry Wallace years prior (which he had not thought of) and the idea clicked. Wallace was fascinating because he was not only a basketball star who broke racial barriers, but also a high school valedictorian, engineering major, law school graduate and eventually a law-school professor. Maraniss had a full- time job, so his research and writing was on nights and weekends and was slow- moving, but he managed to do over 80 interviews in his preparation. To the credit of his research, Maraniss uncovered a transcript of a 1968 statement of Wallace's own words to the Vanderbilt race relations committee: \\"An occurrence of no consequence for a white player was transformed into a nightmare\\". Maraniss and Wallace became fast friends through their dozens of interviews as well as later one-on-one public interviews which were broadcast. The manuscript was published by the Vanderbilt University Press and became the best-selling book in its history. Maraniss said, \\"It was seven years before I had a publisher, so I didn't know if it would ever get out there...\\" With the book's success, Maraniss was besieged with book signings and requests to appear on talk shows including NBC's Meet the Press, NPR's \\"All Things Considered \\", MSNBC's \\"Morning Joe \\" ESPN's \\"Keith Olberman Show, \\" ESPN Radio's \\"The Sporting Life \\" and others. He has created an adaption of the original book, for young people, with a slightly different title, \\"Strong Inside: The True Story of How Perry Wallace Broke College Basketball's Color Line\\". This edition was named as one of the Top 10 Biographies for Youth and a Top 10 Sports Books for Youth of 2017 by the American Library Association. Following the success of Maraniss' book, a motion picture documentary depicting Wallace's life has been made by filmmaker Rich Gentile, entitled \\"Triumph: The Untold Story of Perry Wallace\\". It is narrated by Academy Award winning actor Forest Whitaker. The documentary coincides with the 50th anniversary of the integration of SEC basketball, and premiered at Vanderbilt on December 4, 2017. The film was commissioned by Vanderbilt University, and Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos is one of the film's executive producers. As of 2017, the film was not commercially released.

Version 1.0 of the Autocrypt specification was released in December 2017 and makes no attempt to protect against MITM attacks. It is implemented on top of OpenPGP replacing its complex key management by fully automated unsecured exchange of cryptographic keys between peers .  Method  Autocrypt-capable email clients transparently negotiate encryption capabilities and preferences and exchange keys between users alongside sending regular emails. This is done by including the key material and encryption preferences in the header of each email, which allows encrypting any message to a contact who has previously sent the user email. This information is not signed or verified in any way even if the actual message is encrypted and verified. No support is required from email providers other than preserving and not manipulating the Autocrypt specific header fields. When a message is encrypted to a group of receivers, keys are also automatically sent to all receivers in this group. This ensures that a reply to a message can be encrypted without any further complications or work by the user.  Security model  Autocrypt is guided by the idea of opportunistic security from RFC 7435 but implementing something much less secure than a trust on first use (TOFU) model. Encryption of messages between Autocrypt- capable clients can be enabled without further need of user interaction. Traditional OpenPGP applications should display a noticeable warning if keys are not verified either manually or by a web of trust method before use. In contrast, Autocrypt completely resigns on any kind of key verification. Key exchange is during the initial handshake and valid or invalid keys of peers may be replaced anytime later without any user interaction or verification. This makes it very easy to exchange new key(s) if a user loses access to the key but also makes the protocol much more susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks than clean TOFU. The underlying OpenPGP implementation makes it often possible for the user to perform manual out of band key verification, however by design users are never alerted if Autocrypt changed the keys of peers. Autocrypt tries to maximize the possible opportunities for encryption, but is not aggressive about encrypting messages at all possible opportunities. Instead, encryption is only enabled by default if all communicating parties consent, allowing users to make themselves available for encrypted communication without getting in the way of their established workflows. Man- in-the-middle attacks are not preventable in this security model, which is controversial. Any attacker who can send emails with forged sender-address can cause encryption keys to be replaced by keys of his choice and/or deliberately turn off encryption.  Technical details  Autocrypt uses the established OpenPGP specification as its underlying data format. Messages are encrypted using AES and RSA keys, with a recommended RSA key length of 3072 bits. These mechanisms are chosen for maximum compatibility with existing OpenPGP implementations. There are plans for moving to smaller Elliptic-curve keys when support is more widely available.

Plot  In Europe, American high school students and crimefighters Kim Possible and Ron Stoppable have thwarted a world dominating scheme of Professor Dementor and rescued Dr. Glopman, whom Dementor had kidnapped. As Kim and Ron start their first day of school, they meet a new student named Athena and take her on a mission to stop the plot of the evil Dr. Drakken. Athena (a skilled b≈çjutsuka) defeats Dr. Drakken's henchwoman Shego, making her the topic of conversation at Middleton High School despite Kim's jealousy. When the school honors Athena and her good deed, Shego and Dr. Drakken force their way into the ceremony. Kim tries to defeat Shego and her army of henchwomen but falls to the ground, leaving Athena vulnerable to kidnap. Athena is captured and Kidnapped taken away and Kim is laughed at. After Kim talks with her family and Ron, they decide to rescue Athena from Drakken's and Shego's lair. At the lair, however, Kim discovers Athena is part of Drakken's and Shego's plan to steal Kim's motivational essence and transfer it into Drakken with his brain-modulating device. Athena is revealed to be a gynoid built by Drakken, specifically for this. As Kim short-circuits the transfer machine, Dr. Drakken is de-aged into a pre-adolescent version of himself. Despite Kim's insistence that she save herself, Athena stays behind to turn off the now-unstable machine. The lair explodes and Athena is presumed killed, but it is revealed that she has survived the explosion. Kim and Ron take her home to be repaired and programmed to be a hero alongside themselves.

She was the first woman mayor in Massachusetts and New England. Early life Burke was born in Whitinsville, Massachusetts. She graduated from Northbridge High School and Fitchburg Normal School. She was a teacher in Hampden County, Massachusetts for 20 years before entering politics. Political career In 1933, the Westfield School Committee adopted a policy of employing only unmarried female teachers and fired Burke from her job as a sixth-grade teacher. That fall she was elected to the Westfield School Committee by four votes. In 1935 she was a finalist for Mayor of Westfield, but was ruled ineligible because of an ordinance preventing individuals who were receiving a salary from the city from running for Mayor (Burke was paid as a member of the school committee). She was eligible to run in 1937, but lost to incumbent Raymond H. Cowing by 561 votes. In 1939, she defeated Cowing 3637 votes to 3510. She was reelected in 1941, but lost to city councilor Arthur B. Long in 1943. In 1944 she was an unsuccessful candidate for the Massachusetts Senate in the Hampden, Hampshire and Berkshire district, losing to Republican Ralph Lerche. She was a finalist for mayor in 1949 and 1951, but lost in the runoff election both times. Her 1953 campaign was a success, but she went on to lose reelection in 1955 to Leonard Warner. In 1957, she defeated Warner in a rematch. Her third term would end as quickly as her second, though, as she lost to John D. O'Connor. Her next attempts to regain the mayoralty failed as she lost to O'Connor in 1961 and Harold Martin in 1963 and 1965. From 1968 to 1973, Burke was an at-large member of the Westfield city council. Burke died on May 14, 1974, in Springfield, Massachusetts. She was 81 years old.

History  Edson Diogo, creator of Guia dos Quadrinhos, was responsible for the \\"price guide\\" section of the Brazilian edition of Wizard magazine in 1990s. The difficulty of obtaining reliable information about Brazilian comics at the time inspired him to create the database. The first version of Guia dos Quadrinhos was aired in 2006 and was updated manually by Diogo after receiving information sent by readers to him. In 2007, after suggestion of journalist Ricardo Soneto, the project became a collaborative database and had its official release.  Structure  The Guia dos Quadrinhos database records all information about Brazilian comics, such as date of publication, publisher, genre, size and price. For each edition of magazines or graphic novels, there is the possibility of individually registering each story, as well as authors, characters and story arcs. In the case of Brazilian editions of foreign material, there is also the indication of the original work, with cover and complete data. There is also a list of authors and publishers, with a list of the works in which they participated. Guia dos Quadrinhos also has a blog, a space for publishing studies about comics and a social network in which users can relate and publicize their collections of comics. All informations are registered by collaborators. Covers are only posted after site team approval and, in some cases, after Diogo's digital restoration if the original comic book was very old and rare. New data also is checked regularly.  Festival Guia dos Quadrinhos  In 2009, the Festival Guia dos Quadrinhos was organized for the first time (until 2013, was called Mercado das Pulgas - Flea Market). The event is held bi-annually in S√£o Paulo and its main objective is to give space for comic collectors to sell and exchange comics and related materials. Since 2009, the Festival also has booth for artists and publishers, as well as talks with artists and comics professionals.  Books  In 2017, Guia dos Quadrinhos published a book in honor of Jack Kirby (Os mundos de Jack Kirby: um tributo ao rei dos quadrinhos, ). Organized by Edson Diogo and comic artist Will, the book counted with 100 Brazilian artists, who draw the most important characters created by Kirby accompanied by descriptive texts. The book was crowdfunded by Brazilian crowdfunding website Catarse. In 2018, a new book was released, also by crowdfunding, this time honoring the Vertigo imprint (Vertigo: al√©m do limiar, ). 25 writers and 25 artists participated in the book, which also featured interviews with Karen Berger, Jamie Delano and Peter Milligan.  Awards  In 2017, Guia dos Quadrinhos won Trof√©u HQ Mix as a homage to its 10th anniversary.

When completed, the skyscraper is expected to become the tallest building in Africa, and the third tallest building in the Southern Hemisphere, at 70 stories and over in height. Location The skyscraper is located in Upper Hill, on a piece of property, approximately , south-west of the city centre of Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya. Overview The development consists of two adjacent towers. The shorter tower, at 46 floors will house the 257-room, five-star Upper Hill Hilton Hotel, the third Hilton franchise in Nairobi and the 50th on the African continent. The taller tower, with 70 floors, will feature eleven floors of commercial office space, nine floors of upscale rental retail space, and 46 floors with 210 upscale 1, 2 and 3-bedroom, serviced residential apartments. Other amenities include conference facilities, a gymnasium, luxury spa and an infinity pool. The taller tower will have a roof-top helipad, to allow chopper directly from/to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, away.

The main contractor is China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC). Commissioning of the building is expected in 2020. Delays and land ownership dispute A dispute has arisen over ownership of part of the land being used for construction. The High Court has issued arrest warrants for the directors of White Lotus Projects, Poosapati Ramachandra Raju Sita and Mohamud Mahat Noor. The dispute began when legal action was taken against Hass Petroleum by Ugandan tycoon James Mugoya and a trust formed by former United Arab Emirates leader Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan.

Career Union sailed to England soon after her launch. The EIC announced the sale on 30 April 1802 of 1,300 bags of rice that had come from Bengal on in private trade. The sale of Georgianas rice was to follow the sale that day of 27,000 bags of rice for the EIC's account that the East Indiamen , Cornwallis, , and Union had brought.

Union was at Saugor on 8 March. She sailed in company with Sir William Pulteney and reached St Helena on 28 June. Union sailed from St Helena on 9 July in company with Sir William Pulteney and a third EIC \\"extra\\" ship, . The Governor of St Helena, Colonel Robert Patton, permitted them to sail without escort. (Had he held them until a convoy had formed, the EIC would have been liable for hefty demurrage charges.) Captain Mungo Gilmore, of Eliza Ann, was the senior captain and Patton appointed him to command the group. At daylight on 22 August, the Indiamen sighted a French privateer brig that sailed towards them and engaged Union, which was the leading ship. The engagement lasted about 20 minutes and the French vessel surrendered at after Eliza Ann and Sir William Pulteney came up. The privateer was Venus, and she was armed with sixteen 4, 8, & 12-pounder guns. She had a crew of 73 men (of whom five were away on prizes), under the command of Lieutenant Pierre Henri Nicholas Benamy of the French Navy. In the engagement Venus had lost one man killed and had two men seriously wounded. (Union had two men wounded.) She also had on board five men from a prize crew that had put on a Spanish vessel that Venus had recaptured. The Indiamen divided up the French prisoners among them. The next evening, west of Scilly, Venus parted from the Indiamen and headed for a British port. Sir William Pulteney, Eliza Ann, and Union arrived at The Downs on 2 September. Venus arrived at Deal on 24 September.\\"Ship News.\\" Times [London, England 26 Sept. 1804: 4. The Times Digital Archive.

Union was one of the EIC vessels that were part of the expedition under General Sir David Baird and Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham that would in 1806 capture the Dutch Cape Colony. They would carry supplies and troops to the Cape, and then continue on their voyages. Union reached the Cape of Good Hope by January 1806.

She was sold there late in 1816, and Youghusband and his crew were paid off.Selections... (1869), p.601. Fate Although it is clear that Union foundered, there is disagreement over when and where. Part of the problem is that Union was a common name, and several vessels by that name were lost in 1815 in the East Indies. By one report Union foundered in the Indian Ocean in November 1815. A second report has Union, Barker, master, from Bengal to Batavia, Netherlands East Indies and an English port, lost around November 1815, about a month after leaving Bengal. By a third account she was lost the same year, but at Enggano Island, off Sumatra. An account of her loss links Union, Barker, master, with Enggano. Union, Captain Barker, left Bengal in December 1815, bound for Batavia, and nothing was heard of her for some 16 months. Eventually a crewman arrived at Fort Marlborough and reported that she had wrecked on Enggano. Many of her crew remained on the wreck and died. Her master, three officers, two gunners, one European passenger, and several other people had succeeded in getting to shore. There the inhabitants took them prisoner, stripped them naked, divided them into three groups, and put them to hard labour. The ship Good Hope, with a surgeon and a party of troops had been dispatched from Fort Marlborough to rescue the prisoners.Literary Panorama and National Register, Vol. 7, col. 483. Another account states that the seaman who escaped was a native of Batavia, and that he escaped with two lascars. He reported that about 50 men had survived the wrecking. The escapees stole two canoes that they tied together and succeeded in reaching Crooe,Krui , about seven miles SE of Pisang Island. from where they were forwarded to Fort Marlborough, where they arrived in January 1817. The rescue party in Good Hope traded a variety of articles with the inhabitants for the captives.Edinburgh Observer: Or, Town and Country Magazine, Issues 1-11, 25 October 1817, p.86. Yet another account gives the name of Good Hopes master as John Napier. It states that Barker, his officers, and most of the crew died from the treatment they received.

It has two or three leaves at its base and up to seven pale green, insect-like flowers with reddish glands on its labellum. Description Arthrochilus apectus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber which produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. It has two or three leaves at its base, each leaf long and wide. Between three and seven insect-like flowers long are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and the lateral sepals are long and about wide. The petals are long, about wide. The petals and lateral sepals turn backwards against the ovary. The labellum has a purple base and is about long, on a stalk or \\"claw\\" long. The callus is about long with its central part covered with many tiny, shiny, hair-like glands and the tip is about wide with shiny black glands. Flowering occurs from November to February. Taxonomy and naming Arthrochilus apectus was first formally described in 2004 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Heathlands Reserve near the tip of Cape York. The description was published in The Orchadian. The specific epithet (apectus) is from the Ancient Greek word apektos meaning \\"uncombed\\" or \\"unkempt\\". Distribution and habitat The untidy elbow orchid grows in forest on the northern part of the Cape York Peninsula. Ecology As with other Arthrochilus orchids, A. apectus is pollinated by male thynnid wasps of the genus Arthrothynnus although the species involved is not known.

Biography  ƒ∞shak S√ºkuti was born in Diyarbakƒ±r, Ottoman Empire into a poor family.Me≈ürutiyet uƒürunda √∂ld√ºƒü√º i√ß√ºn Me≈ürutiyetle yadnamƒ± dirilen bir √∂l√º ‚ÄúSan Remo‚Äôda ƒ∞shak S√ºk√ªt√Æ‚Äù, 1, 15 Te≈ürin-i evvel 1325, pp. 14-15. After his graduation from Kul√ºli Military Medical School, S√ºkuti registered at the G√ºlhane Military Medical Academy in Sarayburnu in 1887. He joined Ibrahim Temo, Mehmed Reshid and fellow Kurd Abdullah Cevdet in forming a progressive secret society called Ittihad-ƒ± Osmani Cemiyeti, later known as the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) and originally devoted to overthrowing the absolute rule of Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II. By completing his education, he became a medical doctor. Working at Haydarpa≈üa hospital he opposed the administration of sultan Abd√ºlhamid II. In 1896 the Ottoman government discovered a plot to overthrow the sultan by CUP members and most of them such as S√ºkuti were exiled to Tripolitania, from where he later escaped and went to Geneva, Switzerland. Along with Abdullah Cevdet, he published a CUP newspaper Osmanlƒ± Gazetesi (Ottoman Gazette) in Geneva and at times both were assisted by Tigrane Zaven, an Armenian intellectual. S√ºkuti contributed to the publication with anonymous articles and Osmanli was published through his financial assistance. On 9 February 1902 S√ºkuti died in Sanremo. His death had profound consequences on remaining members who belonged to the old core of the CUP organisation and were not part of other newer factions. During his lifetime the leadership and assistance of S√ºkuti had made it possible for the remaining members of the old CUP to function and the membership acknowledged that reality and grieved his death. S√ºkuti was well respected among fellow members of the old CUP. Ahmet Rƒ±za, a leader of the new CUP group wrote in Mechveret Supplement Fran√ßais a short obituary note. Rƒ±za held a low opinion of the old CUP faction and was open about having no respect for S√ºkuti. Following S√ºkuti's death an additional problem arose for the membership of the old CUP organisation. In life he was their archivist for nearly several years and had gathered a large amount of documents on the organisational and internal matters of the CUP. After his death the sultan ordered Ottoman diplomats to take ownership of those papers and they were transferred to the palace with the event being a blow to the old CUP faction as Ottoman Intelligence had possession of sensitive information.

History  Originally known as AMF Bowling Australia, originating as the Australian part of the bowling division of American Machine and Foundry (AMF). AMF began a joint venture to manufacture pinspotters in Australia in 1959 in view of the growing popularity of ten-pin bowling in the country at the time. By 1964 1,600 bowling lanes existed in Australia, but the popularity of the sport had begun to decline. In 1985 a group of private investors in Richmond, Virginia, United States purchased the bowling division of American Machine and Foundry to form AMF Bowling Companies, Inc. (later known as AMF Bowling Worldwide). The company then bought two major Australian bowling chains to revive interest in bowling. AMF Australia expanded from 16 bowling centres to 30 by 1987, and to over 40 by 2004. AMF Bowling Worldwide sold its Australian division of to Macquarie Leisure Trust (now known as Ardent Leisure) in February 2005 as part of AMF's strategy at the time to re-focus on its U.S. bowling business. In December 2017, The Entertainment and Education Group (TEEG) announced that they had purchased the bowling and entertainment division of Ardent Leisure in order to merge it with its Timezone entertainment business, forming a combined entertainment group encompassing Timezone, AMF, Kingpin and Playtime, one of the world's largest family entertainment centre groups. TEEG operates in six countries with over 250 locations. All AMF bowling centres in Australia were rebranded as Zone Bowling. Centres in New Zealand were rebranded Xtreme Entertainment.

Human!! (Á™ÅÊíÉ! „Éí„É•„Éº„Éû„É≥!! Totsugeki! Hy≈´man!!) is a 1972 tokusatsu series that was produced by Toho. Plot King Flasher, a mysterious being, and his army of Flashers threaten the safety of the Earth, starting by targeting children. Meanwhile, Junichiro Iwaki, a once famous gymnastics coach resigns from his job to train the threatened children. In return, the children used a device known as a Human-Sign to transform Junichiro into a superhero named the Human. From then on, King Flasher began creating monsters to attack the children, but Junichiro was always there to stop them. Later on, Junichiro's brother Junjiro started becoming suspicious of his brother's frequent disappearances. This leads to Junjiro finding out about Junichiro's alter ego. At the same time, King Flasher was overthrown by another evil being called Grand Flasher who nearly killed Junichiro. But, the children spectators used a secondary type of Human-Sign to turn Junjiro into the second Human. Gradually, the Human brothers managed to destroy every last member of the Flasher Core including Grand Flasher himself, restoring peace to the world.

J. J. Bouwman. Sometime around the start of World War II, the family resided in Almelo; their father had been forced into hiding for forbidding a prominent member of the Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging (the National Socialist Movement in the Netherands or NSB) from taking part in religious services related to an evening meal.Bak, Peter.

World War II Willemiena Bouwman found love during the early years of World War II with Willem Pieter (‚ÄúWim‚Äù) Speelman (1919-1945), one of the organizers of Trouw (‚ÄúTrue‚Äù or ‚ÄúAllegiance‚Äù), an orthodox Protestant underground newspaper which was published illegally in violation of Nazi laws prohibiting the free operation of independent press outlets. An economics student at the Vrije Universiteit (Free University), Speelman had been involved with the Dutch Resistance since 1940, writing content for resistance advocacy pamphlets, as well as with Vrij Nederland (Free the Netherlands).Mien van Trouw overladen, Trouw, March 5, 2007.Mien van Trouw, Trouw, December 31, 2007.Bak, Peter.

Under increasing scrutiny by Dutch and German officials, Speelman was forced to go into hiding on April 20, 1941 when that scrutiny turned into a wave of arrests at Trouw. Bouwman would later recall that his date of departure proved ironic since it fell on Adolph Hitler's birthday. By 1942, Bouwman and Speelman were engaged. Afterward, they went into hiding in Groningen; Bouwman then also became active with Trouw's work on behalf of the Dutch Resistance.Bak, Peter. Ze moest wel meedoen aan de verzetsstrijd, Trouw.

According to Yad Vashem, just prior to beginning a massive July 1942 action in Amsterdam, Nazi authorities and their Dutch collaborators had designated the Hollandsche Schouwburg, a Jewish Theater there, as the main holding area for the targeted families. As this round up and subsequent actions progressed, children were separated from their parents and moved across the street to \\"the Cr√®che ‚Äì what had been a day care center for the children of mostly Jewish working mothers.\\" The parents were then taken to the Nazi transit camp at Westerbork, and held there until transported by cattle car to a death camp.\\"Henriette (Hetty) Voute and Gisela Wieberdink- Soehnlein,\\" in \\"Righteous Among the Nations: Featured Stories.\\" Jerusalem, Israel: Yad Vashem, retrieved online April 23, 2018. In 1943, using her alias, ‚ÄúMien van Trouw,‚Äù Willemiena Bouwman became active with the ongoing Cr√®che rescues. Picking up children in Amsterdam on her return from courier trips for Trouw, she transported those children to safe houses located in Friesland and Groningen. Additional rescue trips were also undertaken to Drenthe and Overijssel. In one case, she escorted Barend Stempel on a dangerous train trip north. After dropping the two-year-old off at a temporary shelter, she was able to return home safely.Vooren, Wilhelmina, Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem.Mien van Trouw overladen, Trouw, March 5, 2007.Mien van Trouw, Trouw, December 31, 2007.

Three months later, her fianc√© was arrested, but then managed to escape on December 30. In January 1944, they relocated to Amsterdam in order to facilitate new resistance activities. A year later, her fianc√© was arrested when the Sicherheitsdienst (also known as the ‚ÄúSD‚Äù) raided the printing office of Trouw on Amsterdam's Lijnbaansgracht. Just over two weeks later, Wim Speelman was executed. He was just 26 years old when he died at Halfweg on February 19, 1945.

It included numerous South Korean performers, and was described as an important event in the 2018 thaw in the North Korea‚ÄìSouth Korea relations. Background North Korea's musical ensemble Samjiyon Orchestra had its second performance in Seoul, South Korea on February 11, 2018. On this night, K-pop girl group Girls' Generation member Seohyun surprised the audience by making an appearance on the stage. The event has been described as the first South Korean musical performance in the North in \\"over a decade\\". The previous South Korean performance in the North took place in 2005, with a solo concert by Cho Yong-pil. The Spring is Coming concert was described as a \\"reciprocal cultural visit\\" after North Korea sent performers to the South. In particular, North Korea's Samjiyon Orchestra gave several concerts coinciding with the 2018 Winter Olympics, including a concert in Seoul on February 11, attended by North Korean leader's sister Kim Yo-jong and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. The concert The Spring is Coming concert took part over two days: April 1 (Sunday) and April 3 (Tuesday). The first day featured a 2 hour long concert at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre which seats 1,500. Performers included at least 11 South Korean singers and vocalists, including Cho Yong-pil, Lee Sun-hee, Yoon Do-hyun, Baek Ji-young, Kang San-ae, Seohyun, pianist Kim Kwang-min, five-member rock band YB, as well as five-member K-pop girl band Red Velvet (though one of Red Velvet band members, Joy, did not attend due to scheduling conflicts). The second day featured a joint performance between South and North Korean musicians at the Ryugyong Jong Ju Yong Gymnasium (12,000 seats), with the North side represented by the Samjiyon Orchestra. Approximately 190 South Koreans (musicians, support staff and journalists) traveled to the North for the event. In addition, South Korean taekwondo artists were to perform demonstrations on April 1 and 2, with the Sunday performance at the Pyongyang Taekwondo Hall drawing an audience of about 2,300. The concert on April 1 was attended by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un and his wife, Ri Sol-ju. Kim Jong-un was reported by media, including North Korean KCNA state news agency, and independent observers as enjoying himself, and praised the event himself. He also stated that North Korean musicians may hold another reciprocal event in the South in a few months, tentatively titled \\"Autumn has Come\\". Ordinary North Koreans may be persecuted for listening to foreign media without state permission; North Koreans caught watching South Korean movies, for example, face prison time. Although South Korean journalists were specifically invited to cover the concert, they were prevented from doing so, though apologized to by North intelligence director Kim Yong-chol, who blamed \\"a breakdown in cooperation between Kim Jong Un's security detail and concert organisers\\". The concerts have been seen as acts of cultural diplomacy.

References Category:Ancient Greek writers ","title":"Ariaethus"},{"id":"57249297","text":"In the Tenrikyo religion, Tenrikyo anthropology (Â§©ÁêÜ‰∫∫Â≠¶ Tenri ningaku) is the study of humanity and its relationship to God in the context of Tenrikyo theology. This is not to be confused with the social science of anthropology. A thing lent, a thing borrowed The core teaching regarding humankind's relationship to God is \\"a thing lent, a thing borrowed\\" („Åã„Åó„ÇÇ„ÅÆ „Åã„Çä„ÇÇ„ÅÆ kashimono karimono), which is the belief that the human body is \\"a thing lent\\" by God and \\"a thing borrowed\\" by the human individual. Only the mind is owned by the individual; therefore, Tenrikyo's understanding of human nature is essentially mental. The concept is closely connected with other teachings related to anthropology such as dusts of the mind, rebirth, and causality. =Mind= The mind lies somewhere within the human body and the mind perceives the world through it. Tenrikyo's teachings do not precisely define what the mind is (e.g. consciousness, self, brain), nor do they explain how, exactly, the mind is one's own. However, they do describe the characteristics and features of the mind ‚Äì for example, a mind can be resolved, replaced, purified, spirited, or gloomy. Tenrikyo's teachings maintain that the original, fundamental nature of the human mind is clear and pure. There was no fall of man which has corrupted its nature. However, due to the freedom given to the human mind, the mind regularly forgets its original nature and acts contrary to God's intention for human beings to live joyously together. These behaviors are referred to as dusts („Åª„Åì„Çä hokori), suggesting that, just as dust collects on the surface of the floor over time, the mind commits wrong behaviors on a day- to-day basis. Also as with dust, the wrong behaviors can be swept away through devotion to God's teachings. Nakayama Miki taught her followers eight dusts of the mind ‚Äì miserliness, covetousness, grudge-bearing, hatred, anger, self- love, greed, and arrogance. =Body= In Tenrikyo, the entire human body is sustained by the providence of God. Tenrikyo's doctrine categorizes God's complete providence into ten aspects (ÂçÅÂÖ®„ÅÆÂÆàË≠∑ j≈´zen no shug≈ç), each aspect sustaining a particular function of the human body such as the digestive system (\\"eating, drinking and elimination\\") and the respiratory system (\\"breathing and speaking\\"). Each aspect also sustains a function in the world such as the water cycle (\\"the rise and fall of moisture\\") and wind, implying that the same God that gives life to human bodies also governs the natural phenomena of the world. =Divine guidance= In Tenrikyo, God shows how well one's mind is being handled by reflecting the state of the mind in the body. This is the principle behind divine guidance (ÊâãÂºï tebiki). When the mind is handled according to God's intention, the blessings of God flow easily into the body and the individual is able to use the body freely. However, if the mind is handled selfishly, against God's intention, then it will accumulate the dusts of the mind. The dusts clog or obstruct the blessings of God, resulting in a bodily affliction. Rebirth Tenrikyo affirms the concept of reincarnation, where the soul continually returns into the world with a new biological life after the death of the previous one. Reincarnation also appears in Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Tenrikyo's understanding of reincarnation is referred to as denaoshi (Âá∫Áõ¥„Åó, \\"to make a fresh start\\"). Denaoshi is related to the teaching of a thing lent, a thing borrowed, in that when a person's physical body dies, the soul is returning to God the body that has been borrowed from God. This allows the soul to accept a new body to be lent by God and thus reenter the physical world. Though the reborn person has no memory of the previous life, the person's thoughts and deeds leave their mark on the soul and are carried over into the new life as the person's causality (see section on causality).Kisala, p.77. Nakayama Miki taught that the process of denaoshi is like taking off old clothes in order to put on new ones, an image that emphasizes the materiality of the body. Human beings are given countless opportunities to realize the world of the Joyous Life (the state of salvation) in this world, as opposed to another realm in the afterlife such as heaven. Causality =Karma= Tenrikyo's understanding of karmic belief is referred to as innen („ÅÑ„Çì„Å≠„Çì) or causality. Broadly speaking, karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).Karma Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2012) In other words, a person's good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed contribute to bad karma and future suffering.Lawrence C. Becker & Charlotte B. Becker, Encyclopedia of Ethics, 2nd Edition, , Hindu Ethics, pp 678 Causality upholds this basic tenet of karma; in the same manner, a person experiences good and bad causality.Kisala, Robert. \\"Contemporary Karma: Interpretations of Karma in Tenriky≈ç and Rissh≈ç K≈çseikai.\\" Japanese Journal of Religious Studies, Vol. 21, No. 1 (Mar., 1994), pp. 73-91: \\"In accord with traditional karmic understanding, it is the accumulation of bad innen that is offered as the explanation for present suffering.\\" In Tenrikyo, the concept is encapsulated in the farming metaphor, \\"every seed sown will sprout.\\"Fukaya, Yoshikazu. \\"Every Seed Sown Will Sprout.\\" Words of the Path. online link Causality also upholds another basic tenet of karma, which is that this personal responsibility carries over many deaths and rebirths of the soul.Kisala, p.77. Though Tenrikyo borrows the term innen from Buddhism and shares the fundamental notions of karma with Buddhism, the concept of innen has different implications in Tenrikyo because its understanding of creation and salvation are distinct from that of Buddhism. To make this distinction clear in writing, Tenrikyo discourse typically renders the term in hiragana (i.e. „ÅÑ„Çì„Å≠„Çì) instead of the kanji found in Buddhist discourse (i.e. Âõ†Á∏Å). =Original causality= At the focal point of Tenrikyo's ontological understanding is the positing of original causality, or causality of origin („ÇÇ„Å®„ÅÆ„ÅÑ„Çì„Å≠„Çì moto no innen), which is that God the Parent created human beings to see them live the Joyous Life (the salvific state) and to share in that joy. Tenrikyo teaches that the Joyous Life will eventually encompass all humanity, and that gradual progress towards the Joyous Life is even now being made with the guidance of divine providence. Thus the concept of original causality has a teleological element, being the gradual unfolding of that which was ordained at the beginning of time.Kisala, p.77. The process of preordaining original causality and developing human beings is taught through Tenrikyo's creation narrative. =Individual causality= Belief in individual causality is related to the principle of original causality. Individual causality is divine providence acting to realize the original causality of the human race, which through the use of suffering guides individuals to realize their causality and leads them to a change of heart and active cooperation towards the establishment of the Joyous Life, the world that was ordained at the beginning of time.Kisala, p.77-8. Tenrikyo's doctrine explains that an individual's suffering should not be perceived as punishment or retributive justice from divine providence for past misdeeds, but rather as a sign of encouragement from divine providence for the individual to reflect on the past and to undergo a change of heart. The recognition of the divine providence at work should lead to an attitude of tanno („Åü„Çì„ÅÆ„ÅÜ \\"joyous acceptance\\" in Tenrikyo gloss), a Japanese word that indicates a state of satisfaction. Tanno is a way of settling the mind ‚Äì it is not to merely resign oneself to one's situation, but rather to actively ‚Äúrecognize God‚Äôs parental love in all events and be braced by their occurrence into an ever firmer determination to live joyously each day.‚ÄùDoctrine of Tenrikyo, Tenrikyo Church HQ, 61. In other words, Tenrikyo emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive inner disposition, as opposed to a disposition easily swayed by external circumstance.Kisala, p.78. =Three causalities= In addition, The Doctrine of Tenrikyo names three causalities (san innen „Åï„Çì„ÅÑ„Çì„Å≠„Çì) that are believed to predetermine the founding of Tenrikyo's teachings. More precisely, these causalities are the fulfillment of the promise that God made to the models and instruments of creation, which was that \\"when the years equal to the number of their first born had elapsed, they would be returned to the Residence of Origin, the place of original conception, and would be adored by their posterity.\\"The Doctrine of Tenrikyo, p.20. The \\"Causality of the Soul of Oyasama\\" denotes that Miki Nakayama had the soul of the original mother at creation (Izanami-no-Mikoto), who conceived, gave birth to, and nurtured humankind. The \\"Causality of the Residence\\" means that the Nakayama Residence, where Tenrikyo Church Headquarters stands, is the place that humankind was conceived. The \\"Causality of the Promised Time\\" indicates that October 26, 1838 ‚Äì the day when God became openly revealed through Miki Nakayama ‚Äì marked the time when the years equal to the number of first-born humans (900,099,999) had elapsed since the moment humankind was conceived.A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, p.436.

The daughter of previous owner Bud Adams, Strunk owns one-third of the Titans franchise, with other members of the family owning the remaining two thirds. The team is currently owned under the banner of KSA Industries, which also owns many of Bud Adams' businesses. Before Strunk took over as controlling owner in 2015, that role belonged to her sister, Susie Adams Smith, whose husband Tommy Smith was team president and CEO. Early career Strunk initially attended Pine Manor College but transferred after a year to the University of Texas at Austin, graduating with a degree in history. Born into extreme wealth, Strunk is also involved with her family's other businesses, which includes Bud Adams Ranches, Inc., and is also the president of Kenada Fox Hounds, a fox-hunting organization, and the Little River Oil and Gas Company. Owner of the Titans Strunk initially inherited a third of the Tennessee Titans upon her father's death, with another third going to her sister, Susie Adams Smith, and the last third to Susan Lewis, widow of their brother Kenneth S. Adams III (who died in 1987), whose shares are also split with their sons Kenneth S. Adams IV and Barclay Adams. Following two tumultuous years with Smith as controlling owner and her husband Tommy as the chairman, the family decided to pass the mantle down to Strunk. Within a couple of years, Strunk and Kenneth IV hired longtime business partner Steve Underwood to replace Tommy Smith as team president and CEO and replaced general manager Ruston Webster with Jon Robinson. Strunk was the representing owner for the Titans during a 2015 league vote. In 2016, Strunk was appointed to the NFL's Hall of Fame committee, and was also named to the Board of Trustees for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Due in large part to Strunk‚Äôs organization of the Titans 2018 uniform reveal event in downtown Nashville, the NFL granted Nashville the honor of hosting the 2019 NFL Draft.

He presented the 1984 television series The Elegant Shed, and co-authored the book of the same name. Mitchell was awarded the gold medal of the New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) in 2005. Biography Born in Auckland on 8 March 1941, Mitchell was the son of John McFarlane Mitchell and Leonelle Lucy Mitchell (n√©e Tizard), and the nephew of psychologist Jack Tizard. Mitchell was brought up in Morrinsville, and completed his architecture studies at the University of Auckland, graduating with a Bachelor of Architecture in 1964. He became a registered architect in 1967. In the early 1970s, Mitchell was involved with Aardvark Films. With Roger Donaldson and Ian Mune, he co-wrote the 1974 television film, Derek. Through the 1970s and 1980s, Mitchell was in practice with Jack Manning and Peter Hill, and he also taught at the University of Auckland between 1972 and 1987. In 1984, Mitchell presented the six-point television documentary series The Elegant Shed, which traversed New Zealand architecture since 1945. To accompany the series, Mitchell and Gillian Chaplin wrote the book The Elegant Shed: New Zealand architecture since 1945, which was published by Oxford University Press in 1984. Mitchell was an avid traveller, adventurer and sailor. In his 30s, he worked on documentaries with Roger Donaldson, travelling to Everest with Sir Edmund Hillary, and then sailing around Cape Horn. In 1990, Mitchell began collaborating with Julie Stout, and they split their time between sailing or travelling around the world while working on projects in Hong Kong and in New Zealand. After living overseas for much of the 1990s, the pair returned to Auckland in 2000 and established Mitchell Stout, later Mitchell Stout Dodd, Architects. In 2014, Mitchell was the creative director of New Zealand's first ever exhibition at the Venice Biennale of Architecture, entitled \\"Last, Loneliest, Loveliest\\". Mitchell died aged 77 in North Shore Hospital in Auckland on 26 April 2018, having suffered from prostate cancer.

Ernest Edward Boniface Perera was born on 29 November 1932 in Dalugama, a suburb of Colombo, the son of John Henry Perera and Agnes. He went to school at St. Benedict's College, Colombo and later Saint Joseph's College, Colombo, graduating with a Bachelor of Economics (BEc Hons) from the University of Peradeniya in 1956. Perera then joined the Ceylon Police on 5 January 1957 as a probationary Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP). His first appointment, following training, was the ASP in charge of the Galle District in 1958. In 1970, he was appointed as the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of the Nuwara Eliya division and the following year, was placed in charge of the Matara District. In 1977, he served as Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) of Colombo Range before he was appointed as Inspector General of the Sri Lanka Police (IGP) on 1 August 1988. He also served as the chairman of Police Rugby Club during the club's dominance of local rugby in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In June 1990, during his tenure as IGP, Perera instructed police officers at all police stations in the Eastern Province to surrender to members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), at the request of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, which resulted in the subsequent mass murder of over 600 unarmed police by the LTTE.

Detained in Dubai was founded when Stirling's colleague from Endemol, Cat Le-Huy was arrested in the UAE. Stirling led the legal team and media that ended with Cat's release. Following the international press coverage of Cat's case, Stirling was continually asked by other victims of injustice for assistance. Detained in Dubai has represented businessmen and celebrities including Matt Joyce & Marcus Lee, Safi Qarashi, Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maltoum, Artur Ligeska, Andy Neal, Jamie Harron, Billy Barclay, Ellie Holman, Laleh Shahravesh, David Oliver, Herv√© Jaubert, Mohammed Haddad, Oussama El Omari, Richard Lau and Christopher Renehan. Other partners and consultants have included Ben Cooper, Nasser Hashem, Rodrigo Blanco, Shahid King Bolsen, and David Haigh. Legal actions in the United Arab Emirates In March 2018, Detained in Dubai responded to requests for help from Latifa bint Mohammed al- Maktoum, a princess and daughter of the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who was taken by masked armed men off a boat near Goa on 4 March 2018. , Latifa's location was unknown, but in December 2018, she was reported by Mary Robinson, former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and friend of Princess Haya, who had lunch with her, to be in the care of her family. Mary Robinson has been publicly criticised by Detained in Dubai and Human Rights Watch. In April 2019, Detained in Dubai attracted media attention to the case of Laleh Shahravesh, a British citizen who was arrested in Dubai for having called her ex-husband an \\"idiot\\" and her ex-husband's new wife a \\"horse\\" in a Facebook post. According to Detained in Dubai, Shahravesh had risked a 2-year prison sentence and a fine for their \\"horseplay\\".  Controversial partnerships and cases  Shahid Bolsen Shahid King Bolsen, nicknamed \\"The Chloroform Killer\\", became involved with the company after Detained In Dubai took up his case in 2012. Bolsen admitted to killing a German engineer he met online in 2006 and escaped from prison. Bolsen has been accused of inciting violence against Americans and American businesses in Egypt as recent as 2015, calling in to question his ongoing association with Detained In Dubai According to The New York times, Bolsen is quoted as saying ‚ÄúThe idea is disruption without bloodshed, I condemn the loss of life and the use of violence against people,‚Äù he said. But, he added, if a few lives are lost to help prevent needless deaths at the hands of security forces, ‚Äúsometimes it is a price to be paid.‚Äù Controversial cases In August 2018, Swedish-Iranian Ellie Holman was charged with having alcohol in her blood after drinking one complimentary glass of wine on an Emirates flight prior to her arrival in Dubai. Radha Stirling of Detained in Dubai alleged that \\"the UAE maintains a deliberately misleading facade that alcohol consumption is perfectly legal for visitors\\". According to Detained in Dubai, the UAE presented that she had been detained for visa-related issues, though the official prosecution charge provided that she had been arrested for the consumption of alcohol and invading the privacy of an officer. According to the company, Detained in Dubai has campaigned for legislative reforms to prevent further arrests. In response, Emirates released a statement clarifying that alcohol consumption is not prohibited on their flights and alcohol is served in the lounges in the Dubai International Airport and is available for purchase in the duty-free area of the airport. A statement from attorney General of Dubai was released detailing that Holman attempted to enter Dubai using an expired Swedish passport and was held for less than 24 hours and then deported due to profanity and photographing a government official in a restricted area. Holman later stated that she had been held due to a \\"visa mistake\\". The story was criticized for being \\"fake news\\".

Helsinki-Cotonou Ensemble is a Finnish‚ÄìBeninese afrobeat and funk band. Its leading lights are the Finnish guitarist Janne Halonen and the Beninese singer, percussionist and saxophonist No√´l Sa√Øzonou. The history of the band The history of the band had its origins in Janne Halonen‚Äôs interest in the music of the Beninese guitarist Lionel Loueke. ‚ÄúI was disturbed by the fact that I did not understand that music at all. I liked the end result, but I had no ability to analyze it at all,‚Äù Halonen said to the Finnish news magazine Suomen Kuvalehti in 2015. He sought a residency in Villa Karo in Benin, and before his trip to Africa he went to Gothenburg in order to see a concert by Herbie Hancock, because Loueke played in his band. After the concert, Halonen was able to meet with Loueke in his hotel, and Loueke gave him an introduction to West African music. He also sent word to his friends in Benin that a Finnish acquaintance of his would be coming to the country. Halonen then went to Villa Karo for six weeks in 2009. On his first evening in Benin, there was a knock on his hotel room door, and he was told to take his guitar with him and follow his visitors. Outside there was a pick-up truck with a guitar amplifier at the back. ‚ÄúA local band invited me to the stage at a club and introduced me to the audience. I played with them through the night, just trying to tag along as best as I could.‚Äù Halonen says that that night changed the course of his life. A little later he met No√´l Sa√Øzonou in Grand Popo, who had heard that a Finnish guitarist was looking for him. Sa√Øzonou then became his most important collaborator in Benin. In 2011, Sa√Øzonou visited Finland in order to make music together with Halonen. They formed a band with Juha R√§s√§nen on drums and Sampo Riskil√§ on bass. They soon understood that in order to run a band on two continents they could not do it in a conventional way, with a record deal and a booking agent. They had to run the band as a business enterprise, and for that reason Halonen, Riskil√§ and R√§s√§nen founded a cooperative. However, later they were able to secure a record deal with a record company called Bafe‚Äôs Factory. In 2012, Halonen visited Benin again, this time together with R√§s√§nen and Riskil√§. Together with local musicians, they practised daily, played three concerts and recorded and album called Beaucoup De Piment!, which was mixed and then released in Finland the following year. After the release of the album, they went on a tour of 13 dates in Finland, playing many of the country's major festivals. The second album, Fire, Sweat & Pastis, was released in 2015 and the third one, We Are Together, in 2018. \\"After six years, the hard-working band is still going strong and on record, they are more convincing than ever‚Ä¶ The band, which plays a fusion of afrobeat, jazz and funk, sounds more focused, once they get into the groove. Perhaps they are now more together, having a bit more pop sound than before\\", wrote the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat about the album. At the end of May 2019, the band acted as hosts for the World Village Festival in Helsinki.

With History The district was a high school campus from 1912 to 1928, aiming to train young farmers, rather than have them quit school after 6th grade. It was the third such agriculture-focused high school in the state, following similar schools in Dunn and Marathon counties, and it was probably the largest. Alexander C. Eschweiler designed its buildings. There are five buildings, all with walls of red brick: * The 1911 University building is 1.5 stories, Tudor Revival style, with bargeboards. * The 1911 Class Building is 1.5 stories, in Tudor Revival style, decorated with bargeboards. * The 1911 Administration building is 2.5 stories, Collegiate Gothic style. * The 1911 Dairy Building is 2.5 stories, with bay windows and exposed rafter tails. * The 1911 Horticulture building was 1.5 stories, in a mix of Collegiate Gothic and Tudor Revival styles.

It runs from Sinclair Road in the north to Blythe Road in the south. It is joined on the west side by Fielding Road, Irving Road, Redan Street, and Springvale Terrace. It is joined on the east side by Hofland Road and crossed by Milson Road. History The road was originally known as Masboro Road North, the original Masboro Road being located to the south where Caithness Road is now. It began to be developed in the mid nineteenth century but at that time did not extend much further north than what is now Milson Road. By the end of the century the whole area was developed, mainly with two-up two-down late-Victorian houses.Municipal Journal, Public Works Engineer Contractor's Guide, Vol. 80 (1972), p. 72. In 1970, the street was declared a General Improvement Area (GIA). Former residents include the London artist W.H. Prior in the 1880s.William H Prior England and Wales Census, 1881. Family Search.

The Havelock Tavern The former Bird in Hand public house The street contains three public houses, the Havelock Tavern on the corner with Irving Road, the former Bird in Hand (rebuilt 1926) on the corner with Milson Road, and the Old Parrs Head on the corner with Blythe Road. The original Bird in Hand dated from at least the 1860s, and the other two pubs to before 1900. Nikolaus Pevsner writes that The St Mary's Roman Catholic Primary, designed by P.J. Mabley in 1977-78, has the semi-open plan introduced in the late 1960s. Opposite is Springvale Terrace, designed by Renton Howard Wood Associates 1967-70, which Pevsner writes was one of the local authority's \\"early attempts at an alternative urban recipe for high-rise flats\\", and obtrusive because of its dark brickwork.Pevsner p. 221.

It has up to five dark green leaves at its base and up to fifteen pale green, insect-like flowers with dark reddish black glands on its labellum. Description Arthrochilus aquilus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber which produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. It has between two and five dark green leaves at its base, each leaf long and wide. Between three and fifteen insect-like flowers long are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and the lateral sepals are long and wide. The petals are long and about wide. The petals and lateral sepals turn backwards against the ovary. The labellum is about long and on a stalk or \\"claw\\" long. The callus is about long with its central part crowded with many shiny, dark reddish hair-like glands and the tip is about wide with shiny black glands. Flowering occurs from November to February. Taxonomy and naming Arthrochilus aquilus was first formally described in 2004 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Heathlands Reserve near the tip of Cape York. The description was published in The Orchadian. The specific epithet (aquilus) is a Latin word meaning \\"dark coloured\\" or \\"blackish\\". Distribution and habitat The dark elbow orchid grows in forest on the northern part of the Cape York Peninsula. Ecology As with other Arthrochilus orchids, A. aquilus is pollinated by male thynnid wasps of the genus Arthrothynnus although the species involved is not known. It also reproduces asexually by producing new tubers.

Obviously, anyone with any intelligence had strong feelings about the war in Vietnam during the early '70s, and it could be said with accuracy that any performance of this group would have been about Vietnam just as much as this one was, as well as being about any number of other things. The great thing about the Revolutionary Ensemble was the range of grooves and sound areas the trio would get into, much of which is represented as this piece unfolds. The cooking sound of drums, bass, and the violin of Leroy Jenkins soaring above was sometimes what certain parts of the audience were always waiting for, but, like many of the AACM groups, this trio also loved to explore the worlds of silence and space\\". On All About Jazz, Raoul D'Gama Rose noted \\"It is hard to imagine why it was not first greeted with more fanfare upon its original release, but perhaps the world of art was much crueler towards modern musicians. The music on Vietnam rises like a primordial wail and growl from the guts of Jenkins' violin and Sirone's bass. ... Vietnam is a staggering composition; an epic lament of two peoples and the world at war. If it was not recognized as a major contribution in 1971, that fact ought to be reconsidered today\\".DeGama Rose, R.
