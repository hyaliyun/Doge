Bennison Jihad and its interpretations in pre-colonial Morocco, Routledge, 2002, , p. 36 He undertook diplomatic missions to the Ottoman court and engineered government attempts to bring tribes under central authority. His writings include several historical accounts of the Ottoman and Alaouite dynasties. Az-Zayyani wrote fifteen works in the field of history and geography. Some authors even consider him the greatest historian of Morocco.Mohammed Lakhdar, La vie littéraire au Maroc sous la dynastie alaouite, Rabat, 1971  Origins  Az- Zayyani has left his genealogy which, according to his grandfather, goes back to Sanhaj, the ancestor of the Sanhaja tribes, by Zayyan, the eponymous ancestor of the tribe itself, by Amalu, father of Zayyan and by al-yasa', who would have converted to Islam in the reign of the Umayyad Caliph abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (eighth century AD). He cites as the guarantor of this ancestry the great Berber genealogist Sabiq ibn Sulayman al-Matmati.  Biography  On his return from the journey he made among the Zayyans in 1689, the Alaouite Sultan Isma'il brought back to Meknes az-Zayyani's grandfather, who became his Imam and died in this city the same year as him 1727. His son Ahmed then moved to Fez, where the future historian (az-Zayyani) was to be born eight years later. Abu'l-Qasim az-Zayyani was born in Fes in 1734/35. He was from the zayyan tribe, a big Berber tribe in Moroccan Middle Atlas, where his grandfather Ali ibn Ibrahim who was a Jurisconsult and a valuable genealogist lived in the zawiyya of Aroggo, near Adekhsan. Among his grandfather's work was a book on Berber genealogy. Abu'l-Qasim made his Islamic studies in Fes, which he completed in 1785. He was then twenty-three years old. He had taken courses in the mosques of al-Qarawiyyin and al-Andalusiyyin and frequented the two madrasas of al-Sahrij and al-'Attarin. His principal masters were, first of all, Ahmed ibn at-Tahir ach-Chargi, then the biographer Muhammad ibn at-Tayyib al-Qadiri, Abd al-Qadir Boukhiris, Mohammed Bennani, and above all the famous jurisconsult Abu Hafs 'Umar al-Fasi, to the lessons of which were pressed the already known ulama, like Abd as-Salam Hassin, al-'Arbi al-Qosantini, Muhammad Sahnun, al-Walid al-'Iraqi, Yahia ach-Chafchawani, Muhammad al-Huwwari and Muhammad ibn Abd as-Salam al-Fasi. During the reign of Sultan 'Abd Allah, the year in which his studies ended, az-Zayyani accompanied his father and mother, who had resolved to accomplish the pilgrimage; He was their only son and they wanted to settle with him definitively in Medina. Thus the two houses and the library of the historian's father were sold. They first went to Cairo to join the caravan of the Egyptian pilgrims; But instead of gaining the Hijaz by land, they preferred to embark on the sea for Arabia by renting a boat. The journey was less fatiguing, and at the same time afforded the opportunity of making a commercial operation which might be fruitful. They bought, with all the money they had, various merchandise, which they carried from Cairo to Suez on renting camels. But bad luck had already begun to fall on az-Zayyani: during the crossing would happen the first of seven nakabat (calamities) who struck him during his life. Arrived in view of yanbu', the ship that carried pilgrims traffickers broke on the reefs, and the cargo was lost: passengers and crew escaped death. The Moroccan family landed on Arab land in the utmost destitution. Fortunately, az-Zayyani's mother had sewed three hundred pieces of gold in her belt to counteract a misadventure that was always possible in such a distant journey. She handed them over to her husband, who hired a mount to Jeddah and Mecca, and all three went on their pilgrimage. Then they continued on Medina with the Egyptian caravan and visited the tomb of the Prophet. But with such precarious resources they could no longer think of settling in the city. It was therefore necessary to return to Morocco. After having bought, with the sum which remained to them, some provisions of road, they returned slowly to Egypt, by land route, with the caravan of the pilgrims of this country. Arrived in Cairo, they could get some money, which allowed them to rest a little before getting back on the road. Instead of attending, during this time, the many schools of Cairo, where Islamic studies were taught, az-Zayyani found nothing better than \\"to learn alchemy and divination and to search for the peculiarities of metals and stones\\". Nearly two years had passed since their departure from Fes. At the moment when they were going to resume their journey, they learned of the death of the Moroccan Sultan 'Abd Allah and the accession of his son Mohammed. At Alexandria, no boat weighed anchor; piracy was in full swing and, on the other hand, the Seven Years' War was ongoing. They ended, however, by embarking on a French ship leaving for Livorno. They arrived in this city and stayed there for four months waiting for a new opportunity to leave, and, despairing of finding one, they finally decided to return to Morocco by land, to the Straits of Gibraltar, along the Mediterranean coasts of France and Spain. They thus passed to Marseilles and Barcelona, hoping to see the end of their odyssey soon. In Barcelona they learned that the French besieged Gibraltar, and that it was impossible to cross the strait. They had to wait until the blockade was raised to be able to go to the port and from there to Tetouan. They arrived finally to Fez, having on them only a sum of seven silver mithqal. Immediately in his hometown, Abu al-Qasim az-Zayyani went to visit his old fellow students. His trip had made him different from these latter, whom he found, for the most part, attached to the makhzen of the new Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah. However, in order not to be seen zd inferior by his former classmates, he immediately applied for a secretarial post, which was granted to him. His father, who had probably suffered disrespect in the previous reign, tried by all means to dissuade him from entering the administrative career. Ez-Zayyani didn't change his decision. His beginnings were rather obscure. The task of imperial secretary in Morocco hasn't changed for a long time. The katib present himself at the palace every day, morning and evening, except Thursday and Friday. He writes there, or more often, copies there, if he has a beautiful handwriting, the letters addressed to the governors of the cities and the tribes, the Sherifian rescripts and circular letters. Moroccan Makhzen was a center of intrigues and slander. They were always on the look-out for the slightest oversight of their colleagues, ready to denounce each other for the slightest breach of the established rule, the sultans' officials have contributed for centuries to anarchy and disorder; sovereigns are rare, who have been able to put a stop to their actions and escape, somehow, from their ever-present guardianship. Ez- Zayyani, who, in this milieu, almost arrived as an intruder, after a long stay abroad, with new acquaintances and an open mind, was skilful enough to keep himself in place and to make his qualities recognised soon.  Death  According to the author of salwat al-anfas, al-Kattānī. Az-zayyani died at the time of the Asr of Sunday 17 November 1833. He would have lived thus ninety- nine years. He was buried, by order of the sultan, in the zawiyya of the Nasiriyya Sufi order, which is in Fes, in the district of es-Siaj.

He was appointed Enisei voevoda and proceeded on his first voyage in order to collect taxes from Zabaykalye Buryats.

Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631 and in the following year he and his Cossacks founded Yakutsk, which became a base for further expeditions eastward. He sent his cossacks to explore the Aldan River and further down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes from the locals. In 1640 he transported collected taxes to Moscow where at his arrival he was appointed Strelets and Cossack commander and in 1641 Beketov returned to Enisei Ostrog as the head of the fortress. In 1652 he launched the second tax-collecting voyage to Buryatia, and in 1653 Beketov's cossacks founded a fortress, Irgensky Ostrog, and on the bank of the Ingoda River they built a winter settlement to follow-up, named Chita.

Voorthuizen was founded, according to legend, near a crossing of a ford ('Voorde') of the Ganzenbeek, a brook that no longer exists, on the road from Amsterdam to Deventer. This road was called a \\"Hessenweg\\" ('Hessian road') because seasonal labourers from Westphalia would travel along this road into the Netherlands. Another important road that lead through this place was the trade route from Harderwijk to Wageningen. This made Voorthuizen an important stop along these two routes. A new high road was commissioned and built by King Louis Bonaparte in 1809, which actually divided up the village. During the 20th century, traffic along this route through the centre of the village increased, and a new main road was built in 1972, south of the village. Voorthuizen was a separate municipality between 1812 and 1818. Near the end of World War II, many buildings in the village were heavily damaged due to an engagement between Canadian and German troops on 16-17 April 1945. In 1999, the Seaforth Highlanders of Holland pipe and drum band was founded to commemorate the liberation of the village in 1945 by the Seaforth Highlanders of British Columbia. Due to the increase of the military after the war, the number of military bases and garrisons was rapidly expanded, among others the nearby military base \\"De Wittenberg\\" in Garderen/Stroe (renamed Generaal Majoor Koot Kazerne in 1978), and a mobilization complex at the Garderbroekerweg in Voorthuizen. The influx of military personnel led to the expansion of the village in the early 1950s; one of these new neighborhoods that housed many servicemen -located according to rank,- soon was nicknamed \\"Klein Korea\\" ('Little Korea'). These new inhabitants, and others that followed, lead to a shift in the population, from traditional agricultural labourers to a broader oriented populace, making Voorthuizen one of the more progressive villages in the municipality.

It won three César Awards: for Best First Feature Film, Best Writing and Best Female Newcomer. Plot Antoine, a writer without ambition, is abruptly left by his girlfriend Solange for another man. Wounded in his pride, Antoine tells about his troubles to Jean Costal, his bookseller- publisher friend. Jean proposes to Antoine to use his story with Solange as a starting point for a new book. Antoine is going to pick a woman at random, make her fall in love with him, and then leave her. At the same time, he will keep a detailed journal of the experience, which Jean will publish as a novel. Hesitant at first, Antoine then proceeds with the plan and puts up an ad to find a typist, targeting exclusively young females. He then meets Catherine, whom he deems unattractive, but Jean convinces Antoine that this very aspect would make her a good candidate. But as Antoine gets to know Catherine better, the perfect plan starts falling apart. Cast * Fabrice Luchini as Antoine * Judith Henry as Catherine * Maurice Garrel as Jean * Marie Bunel as Solange * François Toumarkine as Manu * Brice Beaugier as Solange's friend * Yvette Petit as Baker's wife * Nicole Félix as Monique * Olivier Achard as Customer * Serge Riaboukine as Cafe waiter * Katia Popova as Girl in cafe * Amy Laviètes as Ewa * Hélène Hardouin as Catherine's friend * Maria Verdi as Woman in restaurant * Pierre Gérald as Scientist * Sophie Broustal as Girl in pink Background In the late 1980s, Christian Vincent did research on 18th century women's fashion. It was intended for a collective film project for which he was to direct a sketch. In the 18th century, women were wearing little patches, made of a piece of taffeta, to set off the paleness of their skin. Those fake moles, glued to the skin, were known as \\"mouches.\\" The project failed to materialize but it gave the filmmaker the idea for his first feature. The film title refers to the nickname that Antoine gives Catherine because of the mole on her chin. As he explains, in the 18th-century fashion code, such mole was called \\"discreet.\\" Production Producer Alain Rocca founded his company, Les Productions Lazennec, as a workshop for young film- school graduates. The first feature film, Love without Pity, that Rocca produced in 1989, was a critical success, and won a César Award for Best First Feature Film. La Discrète was his second project, with the modest budget of 11.24 million francs ($2.2 million). The script was written by Christian Vincent who worked on it for more than a year with co-writer Jean-Pierre Ronssin. The writers were not paid for this work until the film was in production. The leading roles were given to relatively unknown actors: Fabrice Luchini and Judith Henry. The production went rather smoothly, and the film came in under budget. The actual cost was 10.46 million francs ($1.97 million). Release The film was released in France on November 21, 1990, sold 1.4 million tickets, and became the 20th most watched film of the year. It didn't do well at the U.S. box-office, where it earned only $100,000 in 1992, and failed to recover even its promotional costs. Critical reception The film received wide critical acclaim. The Los Angeles Times said: \\"Life is not a game, but \\"La Discrete\\" is: exquisite, humorous, touching, knowing, beautifully played. The characters may lose, but their audience won't.\\" TV Guide called it \\"richly ironic, erotic, ephemeral, intellectually provocative and downright earthy,\\" and added that it is \\"one of those deceptively small films that rocks the soul with its almost offhanded insights into eternal human truths. It's as good as Rohmer's best, with a lot less talk and a much harder edge.\\" In Film Comment critic Molly Haskell named it her favorite film of the year. The Austin Chronicle called it \\"a wonderful, honest film\\", and said that Vincent's direction is \\"so self-assured it's hard to believe this is his first feature film.\\" Time Out said it was a \\"very Rohmer-esque film\\", and commented that \\"the interest lies not so much in the predictable intrigue - it almost reads like a commonplace seduction comedy - as in the treatment of a particularly unpalatable strain of French amorous discourse.\\" Awards 1991 César Awards: * Best First Feature Film (Christian Vincent) - Winner * Best Writing (Christian Vincent, Jean-Pierre Ronssin) - Winner * Best Female Newcomer (Judith Henry) - Winner * Best Actor (Fabrice Luchini) - Nominee * Best Supporting Actor (Maurice Garrel) - Nominee 1990: Prix Méliès References External links * Category:French films Category:1990 films Category:Films directed by Christian Vincent Category:Best First Feature Film César Award winners Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films shot in Paris Category:1990 directorial debut films ","title":"La Discrète"},{"id":"12248246","text":"John Claude Nattes (c.1765–1839) was a watercolourist and topographical draughtsman of either French or English origin. In 1789 Sir Joseph Banks commissioned him to record the buildings of Lincolnshire and this resulted in more than 700 drawings and watercolours, made between 1789 and 1797, which are now preserved in Lincoln Central Library.Banks Collection of 1400 Nattes drawings, Local Studies Collection, Lincoln Central Library,LN2 1EZ. This body of work provides researchers with a great deal of material with which to study pre-Victorian topography. Nattes accompanied John Stoddart on his tours of Scotland in 1799 and 1800 and contributed illustrations to his Remarks on Local Scenery and Manners in Scotland (1801).Leask, Nigel (2020), Stepping Westward: Writing the Highland Tour c.1720 - 1830, Oxford University Press, pp. 181 Nattes produced some of the earliest examples of watercolour painting in Britain.\\"Nattes, John Claude\\". Dictionary of National Biography He was associated with the founding of the Society of Painters in Watercolours, founded in 1804, but he was expelled after two years for exhibiting other peoples’ work as his own. He continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy until 1814. According to the Dictionary of National Biography Nattes died in London in 1822. However he may have died in Dover, in 1839. This later date is supported by his apparently being a witness at the wedding of Robert Holdsworth Carew Hunt and Bridget Margaret Barber on 16 June 1836 at Holy Trinity Church Clapham. According to Dover Museum, \\"The parish records show that John Claude Nattes of Welbeck Street, Cavendish Square, Middlesex (London), died 7th September 1839 at Dover, aged about 75 years. His funeral was held at St Mary's Church Dover, on the 14th September 1839, and he was buried in Cowgate Cemetery Dover where the gravestone can still be seen\\". It is believed Nattes was temporarily resident in Dover for the sea air and sea bathing benefits to his health. John Claude Nattes married Sarah Barber, daughter of William and Jane Barber. Their son Charles Claude Nattes, born 13 January 1794, was christened in St Andrew, Holborn. He died 21 January 1818 in Penang as a lieutenant in the service of the Madras Engineers. Sarah died in late 1845.

The line was opened in 1844 by the London and Birmingham Railway, as far as Milverton. The line was extended to Leamington Spa Avenue in 1851. A connecting line to opened in 1884. Late in the 19th century most of the route was doubled to increase capacity. Only a small section just outside Kenilworth, at Gibbet Hill, remained single track. Most of the line was singled in 1972. History In 1839 an independent company the Warwick and Leamington Union Railway submitted plans for a new line connecting Leamington with the London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR;) at Coventry, and the plans were approved by an Act of Parliament in 1842. The following year, before the line was built the Warwick and Leamington Union Railway was purchased by the L&BR;, which itself became part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) three years later. The line was opened on 9 December 1844 from Coventry via to the original terminus at what was then known as Leamington station, but later became known (after numerous name changes) as Warwick (Milverton) station. The Milverton terminus was inconveniently located a mile from the centre of Leamington, as it had been intended as a compromise to serve both Leamington and Warwick, located midway between the two towns; this was considered unsatisfactory, and so in 1851 the line was extended closer to Leamington town centre and joined end-on to the LNWR's branch line to Rugby. A new more centrally located station, Leamington Spa (Avenue) opened on this extension in 1854, which was alongside the rival Great Western Railway (GWR) station at Leamington. An accident occurred on the line on 11 June 1861 when a bridge collapsed between Leamington and Kenilworth as an empty goods train was passing over it, killing the train driver and fireman. Originally built as a single track line, the route between Leamington and Kenilworth was widened to double track in 1884, and the stations at Milverton and Kenilworth were rebuilt, however the section from Kenilworth Junction to Gibbet Hill Junction, just south of Coventry remained single track. At the same time a new cut-off line known as the Berkswell Loop was opened from Kenilworth to on the Coventry-Birmingham line. This line avoided Coventry, and allowed the LNWR to introduce a direct Leamington to Birmingham service. The line came under the management of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, and later British Railways in 1948. In the early 1960s, the line, along with the Leamington-Rugby line was heavily used as a diversionary route while the West Coast Main Line was being electrified. However the local passenger service was withdrawn on 18 January 1965 as a result of the Beeching Axe, and Kenilworth, Milverton and Avenue stations were closed. With Avenue station closed, a new connection was built the same year connecting the line to the former GWR Leamington station (previously only a siding had connected the former LNWR and GWR lines at Leamington). The Berkswell Loop was closed on 17 January 1969 after a freight train derailed, and the track was lifted the following year. In 1972 British Rail singled much of the line, but retained some double track to form a passing loop at Kenilworth. In May 1977 British Rail resumed passenger services over the line: This was due largely to the opening of station in 1976 between Birmingham and Coventry, which caused British Rail to re-route many of their Birmingham to , Paddington and south-coast trains via Coventry in order to serve the new station. However none of the intermediate stations were reopened. In August 2007 Network Rail reinstated of double track at the northern end of the line from Park Junction (now removed) to Gibbet Hill Junction in order to increase capacity. =Kenilworth station re-opening= In 2013 funding was approved to rebuild and reopen Kenilworth railway station. The line was also scheduled to be re-doubled from Milverton Junction to Kenilworth and electrified as part of the Electric Spine project, although these plans were put on hold by Network Rail in 2016 and no date has since been given for completion of this work. Construction of the new station at Kenilworth began in July 2016. The opening date was originally meant to be August 2017, although this was repeatedly postponed. It finally opened on 30 April 2018. The new hourly service operated by West Midlands Trains was initially a shuttle between Leamington Spa and Coventry, calling at Kenilworth. Since May 2019 this service has been extended to . The line today Today most of the line is single track which limits the number of services using it. What remains of double track includes a passing loop at Kenilworth, and the lines out from Coventry and Leamington Spa to Gibbet Hill Junction and Milverton respectively. the line is used by the hourly West Midlands Trains service between Nuneaton and Leamington, which calls at Coventry and Kenilworth, and the hourly CrossCountry service from to which calls at Coventry and Leamington only. It is also regularly used by freight trains; mostly container trains operated by Freightliner from the Port of Southampton to the Midlands or North of England via Coventry and . In 2009 thirty such trains used the line daily. Proposed development In July 2019 Warwickshire County Council put forward proposals for six new stations in the county, one of these would be a new station on the Coventry-Leamington line, in between Coventry and Kenilworth which would serve south Coventry and the University of Warwick. If the plans go ahead this would happen between 2026 and 2033.

He was a mighty man of a stocky build, his arms were muscled in particular. Whenever he hit the anvil with a hammer, the whole upper town would quake. He influenced the history of his town when the Ottoman Turks besieged the Nitra Castle. The invaders were just about to climb the castle walls when Corgoň appeared straight from the forge. He started rolling down huge stones, which brought havoc among the Turks. However, what scared them off more than the stones was the gigantic and coal-black smoke-filmed face of Corgoň. Seeing him, they set off for an immediate run. He was believed to be seen extracting those huge stones from a slope assisted by evil spirits. That was how Nitra's upper town managed to survive the first Ottoman attack. The statue of Corgoň would embody the invincible power of this local metalworker forever. There is a simile applied to someone who shows great power in the area surrounding Nitra which says to be as mighty as Corgoň. In the statue, Corgoň is depicted as Atlas. According to a Greek legend, gods punished Atlas for his wrongdoings in a form of columns that he had to hold upright forever as to keep the sky from falling. Later on Atlas was depicted carrying a globe on his shoulders. The artistic concept of the Atlas in Nitra lies in a symbolic holding up the entire floor, which might have its origin in a myth about Corgoň whose bravery kept the upper town safe from the Ottoman raids.

Anderson was due to represent Canada at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, but the Canadian teams boycotted the event. He soon became a top amateur boxer, and later a champion professional boxer. Biography =Olympic career= Making Canada's Olympic team was the biggest highlight of the young light-welterweights' career up to that point. Later that year, Anderson won a gold medal in the light-welterweight division at the Acropolis Cup tournament in Athens, Greece before the Moscow Olympic boycott was announced. Anderson was unaware that politics ran so deeply in sports and he felt in his heart he would be going to Moscow, it never happened. Hear Anderson's personal comments on the boycott in a 2012 Chronicle Herald article entitled: An Olympic dream KO'd by politics.thechronicleherald.ca =Amateur career= Nova Scotia’s Ricky Anderson would prove that he was a champion from the first time he fought as an Amateur in 1974. He’d go on to win the Nova Scotia Fly-weight title in his first year as a boxer. In 1975, he’d capture a Silver medal at that year’s Canada Games held in Lethbridge AB. In 1977, Ricky Anderson would become the first Canadian born boxer to beat a Cuban fighter. In 1980, Ricky made the Canadian Olympic Team but he would not get the chance to represent his country as Canada would boycott the Games in Moscow that year. Yet, 1981 was another big year for Anderson, he won his fourth amateur Canadian Championship. Then, in Shreveport, La., he added the North American light-welterweight crown to his growing collection of gold medals by knocking out U.S. Champion James Mitchell, a former World Army Champion. Following the win over Mitchell, he was named Canadian athlete of the month for September by the Canadian Sports Federation. The stage was now set for the 1981 World Cup of Boxing in Montreal, he would battle for the world championship against Vasily Shyshev of the Soviet Union. Anderson said, he went into the fight a little overanxious. The first two rounds were close and Anderson would need to win the final round to win the fight. But Vasily Shyshev turned it on in the last round and won the fight. Anderson had knocked on the door of a world championship and just missed by a few punches. Anderson had come to this point twice in his amateur career, losing in world championship bouts, in 1979 at the World Junior championship in Yokohama, Japan he lost a narrow decision in the gold medal round to a fighter from the Soviet Union.(Anderson was the first Canadian to win a Silver medal at that level.) But in light of those past performances, he was quite pleased with what he had achieved. His overall amateur record stands at 97 fights, with 85 wins and 12 losses. =Professional career= In 1985, Anderson finally got what he was looking for—a crack at the Canadian Welterweight Boxing Championship. He was delighted by the fact that he was going to meet Guerrero Chavez in a rematch. Anderson said that the Chavez loss might have been the best thing to happen to him. It had opened his eyes and made him realize that he couldn't go in and take out a man like Guerro Chavez in one round. He had to go in, work hard and take his time. Before the fight, Chavez was a picture of confidence, blowing kisses to the ladies at ring-side, mugging for the cameras, and hamming it up for the crowd. This time, however, the ending would be different. This time Anderson would make no mistakes. Anderson fought a text-book fight, using a stinging right hand to set up Chavez in the same corner where he had dominated Chavez in their previous fight. The end came quickly in the eighth round when Anderson delivered a straight left hand that put Chavez down. Chavez was in no shape to continue. Anderson was the new Canadian welterweight champion, a dream come true for the Halifax native. Education Following his 12 year boxing career, Anderson completed his education at Saint Mary's University and currently works as a Drug Prevention Specialist at Addiction Services in Dartmouth. NS. Anderson was once quoted by the Halifax Herald during a Race Against Drugs Program at a local school, when he was asked who is at risk? Anderson replied, \\"I'm at risk, you're at risk, we are all at risk, keep your dreams alive by not getting involved.\\" Anderson is also the owner of Go Ricky Motivational Services (www.goricky.ca), a motivational consultant company in Halifax. He is a current member of the Nova Scotia Boxing Authority and Canadian Boxing Federation, government agencies that regulates professional boxing and mixed martial arts events provincially and federally. The former CTV Atlantic sportscaster and author of Win in the Arena of Life volunteered for 10 years with the Ward 5 Community Centre in Halifax, two years of which he was chairman of the board. The Ward 5 Community Centre is a non profit organization that runs programs to help youth, seniors and others who may be in need. Hall of Fame induction Anderson is a member of both the Canadian Boxing Hall of Fame and the Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame.

History Boreraig, lying in a green and fertile glen, sheltered and south-facing, is a fine example of a traditional, pre-crofting baile or township. It was forcibly cleared by the agents of Lord MacDonald to make way for sheep in 1853. Many of the inhabitants, mainly crofters, emigrated after they were evicted. The Scottish census reveals that, by 1851, in the parish of Strath, Shire of Inverness, approximately one hundred and twenty men, women and children lived in Boreraig's 22 households. Not every adult's occupation was recorded, but where the census taker kept a record, he described most individuals as crofters, agricultural labourers, or farm servants. Among them he also recorded a few weavers, a fisherman, and a house carpenter. Croft tenancy records dating back to 1823, now held by the Clan Donald Centre at the Armadale Museum of the Isles in Sleat on the Isle of Skye, indicate that the twenty two households were spread across ten landholdings, each of . Many of the inhabitants were related. Anglicised death records indicate a good number of the inhabitants had maternal or paternal forebears born with the surname MacInnes. The Boreraig evictions coincided with the high water mark of the Highland and Island Emigration Society(HIES). During the few years it operated, the scheme resettled some 5000 highlanders and islanders in Australia. By 1853 the HIES had accepted at least 8 of Boreraig's 22 households, or just under half the occupants of the cleared village, for sponsored resettlement. In 1852 families from three Boreraig households sailed on the Araminta, the Allison, and the Ontario. Late in the same year, five more Boreraig households set out to emigrate with the HIES. The berths allocated to them were on . Fever broke out on board. Passengers were dying before the ship reached Ireland. If other Boreraig families had been accepted for HIES resettlement, they decided not to take up the HIES option. Clan Donald records indicate approximately seven of the household listed as 1852 Boreraig tenants (whether solely or jointly) eventually ended up as tenants of crofts in other villages. Scottish General Registry Office records confirm this. In oral traditions, stories abound of dreadful hardship endured by Boreraig families who remained in Skye. Though some found another croft to go to, not all of them found house where they could live while they tilled the land to feed their family. They sheltered wherever they could.  Boreraig today  All that is left in Boreraig now is the ruined housing - much of it still standing to wallhead height - and the well-preserved field walls. There is a sense of displacement in Boreraig, as if the inhabitants had only left a short time ago. The biggest and most impressive ruins are those of the house and steading built for the tenant-farmer. The village lost its last residents in 1877. Scottish Gaelic was the language of the inhabitants. The sheep farmhouse was abandoned in 1910. However the land is still used for grazing a flock of approximately 300 breeding ewes of the North Country Cheviot breed, which are hefted onto the area and run from Kilbride. Boreraig cannot be reached by any vehicular transport at all, thus making winter feed supplementation impossible, but the township has some of the most fertile grassland in Strath Swordale so the sheep remain in reasonable condition. There is a standing stone and a remarkable footbridge over a stream consisting of a single slab of stone, which is said to have been lifted into place by one man - \\"Glagan-glùine\\" or \\"Knock-knees\\", who was alive in the early 18th century.Mackay, J.G. \\"Social Life in Skye from Legend and Story\\" (1919). In: Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, vol XXIX p335 The remains of a promontory dun and an anchorage can be seen. There is a very popular circular walk of about , starting and finishing at Kilchrist (Cill Chrìosda or Cill a' Chrò), taking in Boreraig, neighbouring Suisnish (Suidhisnis) and Kilbride (Cille Bhrìghde). The land today, like much of Strath Swordale, is owned by the Scottish Government.

Playing career Kirby was born in Liverpool. He was a centre forward who played for Everton, Sheffield Wednesday, Plymouth Argyle, Southampton, Walsall, Swansea City, Coventry City, New York Generals and Brentford.http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/player/georgekirby.html His career lasted from 1952 to 1969 during which he made 309 Football League appearances and scored 119 goals. Management career His first post in management was at Halifax Town, initially as coach to Alan Ball Senior and then in 1970 as first team manager. He spent only one full season in charge, giving the club their most successful ever campaign just missing out on promotion to the old second division. He started the 1971–72 season by leading Halifax to a 2–1 Watney Cup victory over a full strength Manchester United side, which included George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton. Just a week later Kirby left Halifax to take charge at Watford where he remained until May 1973. At Watford, injuries, boardroom unrest, and a shortage of luck and money, conspired to produce two terrible winters consisting of one humiliation and very nearly a second. He later moved to Iceland where he managed one of the country's leading clubs; Íþróttabandalag Akraness (ÍA)Safnasvæðið Akranesi - Saga íþrótta á AkranesiÞjálfarar ÍA 1951 - 2007 - Íþróttabandalag Akraness In 1978, he left Akranes and returned to Halifax. Kirby inspired the team to another famous victory over Mancunian rivals; this time it was the turn of Malcolm Allison's Manchester City, who fell to a single Paul Hendrie goal in an FA Cup 3rd round tie in January 1980. His second spell with the Yorkshire club ended in June 1981 after a string of poor results saw his team finish second bottom of the old 4th division.

H. Everts & Co., Philadelphia, Pa. The company was chartered on December 9, 1869 and bought the property, which had been \\"Mount Airy\\", the residence of Commodore Stephen Decatur, Sr. Originally chartered as \\"The Greenwood Cemetery Company of Philadelphia\\", the charter was changed to the \\"Knights of Pythias Greenwood Cemetery Company of Philadelphia\\" on March 18, 1870. Greenwood Cemetery was modeled after the rural cemetery movement of the mid 19th century. Designed by architect Thomas S. Levy, the plans for the cemetery were very grand with rolling hills, naturalistic plantings, pathways arranged in a spoke-and-circle pattern, an artificial lake and a large gatehouse. The gatehouse and lake were never realized. Portions of the historic house at the entrance date back to 1750-1775. Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, lived on the farm in the late 18th century. In the early 19th century, a major addition to the house gave it the appearance of a vernacular federal structure.

The oldest grave is unknown, as there were many burials before the cemetery was chartered in 1869, and early records have been lost, but it is believed that it holds the remains of veterans of the Revolutionary War. Over the years, maintenance was neglected. While remnants of the landscaping and plantings typical of a rural cemetery are evident, the cemetery has been the victim of vandalism, with numerous overturned, fallen, and broken tombstones, and the rear of the cemetery reverted to woods. In 2000, the cemetery came under the management of Willow Ridge Ltd., a private company. There was considerable local controversy over the company's plan to raze the historic home and build new structures, including a funeral parlor and crematorium. In 2000, Philadelphia's Zoning Board of Adjustment granted permission for the funeral parlor and crematorium. Several local residents sued in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court to overturn the Board's decision. The court upheld the decision of the Board, and the residents appealed to Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court. On February 8, 2007, Commonwealth Court overturned the decision of the trial court. The cemetery owners then appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, but their appeal was denied on October 18, 2007. The Friends of Greenwood Cemetery, a nonprofit organization established in 2003, dedicated to preserving the records, tombstones, and grounds of the cemetery, made some progress in cleaning it up, mowing the lawns and clearing some of the woods. In 2008, an adjacent hospital, Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) at Eastern Regional Medical Center, through their sister company Greenwood Holdings, acquired a majority share of the cemetery.Tom Waring, \\"One foot in the grave?\\", Northeast Times, December 25, 2008. Greenwood Holdings has begun revitalizing the cemetery. Headstones have been righted; abandoned cars and appliances have been removed. In addition, more than 2,400 graves were moved from a wooded section in order to allow CTCA's expansion. More than $1 million has been spent on renovations of the historic house. Windows, floors, fireplaces, roofs, ceilings and walls were restored.Tom Waring, \\"Greenwood Cemetery transforms into Rush Farm\\", Northeast Times, December 29, 2010.

In Early Middle Ages, Croatia was an important centre for art and architecture in south eastern Europe. There were many Croatian artists during the Medieval period, and the arts flourished during the Renaissance. Later styles in Croatia included Baroque and Rococo.  Ancient heritage  = Prehistoric art = Ancient monuments from Palaeolithic times are very poor and consist mainly of simple stone and bone objects. Ancient inhabitants of Mediterranean cultures on the Adriatic Coast and those of Pannonian cultures in the continental area of the present-day Republic of Croatia, were developing Neolithic cultures in the boundaries of present-day Republic of Croatia. The Neolithic is marked by the production of ceramics and sculptures with human and animal themes presented as symbolic art. The most investigated are listed chronologically: *Starčević culture (Pannonian culture named after its founder archaeologist Starčević) had characteristically fine red and ochre ceramics. *Istrian culture (named after peninsula Istria in Croatia) which characteristic is stone houses (Bunja) without any type of bonding material, natively called dry-wall building (suhozid). These types of houses have stayed in use until the 19th century for shepherds. *Sopot culture and Korenovo culture (named after towns of Sopot and Korenovo in Slavonia) with original ceramic pots decorated with flat parallel lines, curves or V-shaped cuts. *Danilo culture (found on Adriatic coast and islands) was rich with fine dark ceramics decorated with engraved geometrical motifs, spirals and meanders. *Danilo culture (found on Adriatic Coast and Islands) was rich with fine dark ceramics decorated with engraved geometrical motifs, spirals and meanders. Out of this culture developed the Hvar culture (after large island of Hvar) that is linked with Neolithic Greek cultures. There are also Neolithic excavation sites in Ščitarjevo near Zagreb, Nakovanj on the Pelješac peninsula and elsewhere. =Copper Age= One of the most unusual Copper Age or Eneolithic finds is from the Vučedol culture (named after Vučedol near Vukovar). Ceramics are of extraordinary quality with black color, high glow and specific decorative geometrical cuts that were encrusted with white, red or yellow color. Few sculptures have been found. They are very skilfully and expressively done (like the pot in shape of Dove with engraved double axe – labrys). People lived on hilltops with palisade walls. Houses were half buried, mostly square or circular (they were also combined in mushroom shape), with a floor of burned clay and circular fireplace. =Bronze Age= Out of that culture emerged Bronze Age Vinkovci culture (named after the city of Vinkovci) that is recognizable by bronze fibulas that were replacing objects like needles and buttons. The Bronze culture of the Illyrians, ethno-tribal groups with distinct cultures, and art forms started to emerge from the cultures of the Copper Age. These Illyrian ethno-tribal areas were found in present-day Croatia, and Bosna and Hercegovina. From the 7th Century BC, iron replaced bronze and only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. The Celtic Halstat culture which bordered the Balkan region where the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups were living influenced them, but the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups formed their regional centers slightly differently. In the northern Balkan Peninsula, the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups had the cult of the dead, as evidenced from the richness of and care for burial sites, from which burial ceremonies are deduced. These burial sites show a long tradition of cremation and burial in shallow graves. In the southern Balkan Peninsula, the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups buried their dead are in large stone, or earth tumuli (natively called – gromile). Illyrian Japod tribes had an affinity for decoration with heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste. The Illyrian Japod tribes also had affinities for large bronze fibulas, spiral bracelets, diadems, and helmets made out of bronze. Small sculptures made of jade made from the archaic Ionian plastic are also found in Japodian tribal areas. Numerous monumental sculptures are preserved, as well as walls of a citadel called Nezakcij near present-day Pula, one of the numerous Istrian cities from Iron Age. =Celtic Entrance to Balkan Peninsula= In the 4th century BC, the first emergence Celts into the Illyrian ethno-tribal areas of the Balkans is recorded; they brought the technique of the pottery wheel, new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts, which the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups had not independently developed. The Celts also mixed with the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups in Slavonia, Istria, and Dalmatia. They passed through Greece burning several Greek Polis on their way to settling in Asia Minor (Anatolia) where they remained to be addressed by Saint Paul in his Epistle to the Galatians. The Greco-Illyrians & Roman Conquest  In the Neretva Delta in the South, there was the important influence of Hellenistic Greco-Illyrian tribe of the Daors. Illyrian tribes conquered Greek colonies on Dalmatian islands. The Queen Teuta of Issa (Today Issa island is known as the island of Vis.) is famous because she waged wars with Romans. But finally, Romans subdued Illyrians ethno-tribal groups in the 1st Century BC. After that, these Illyrian provinces became parts of Rome and New Rome (Byzantium). = Antiquity = Greek sailors and merchants from the Greek City States of the south of the Balkan peninsula reached almost every part of Mediterranean including the Adriatic Sea coast of present-day Croatia. Greeks also came from Syracuse on Sicily in 390 BC to the islands of Vis (Issa), Hvar (Pharos), and Korčula (Corcyra Nigra) thereby founding city-states amongst the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups. Greek trade cities on the Adriatic Coast such as Tragurion (today called Trogir), Salona (today called Solin near present-day Split), Epetion (today called Stobreč), Issa (today called Vis), were geometrically shaped and had villas, harbours, public buildings, temples and theatres. Pharos and Issa were strong Greek City States that showed their independence with their own coinage and maritime fleets. Unfortunately, besides painted pots and ceramic tanagra sculptures, there are few daily living materials remaining of this culture. Two of those are: the Croatian Apoxyomenos, and the Bronze head of goddess Artemis from the Greek City State of Issa, which dates from the 4th century BC. Another example is a stone relief of Kairos (god of joyfulness) from the Greek City-State Tragurion, which dates from the 3rd Century BC, and is associated with the famous Greek sculptor Lysippos. While the Greek colonies were flourishing on the Adriatic Coast and Islands, on the mainland the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups were organizing their centers. Illyrian ethno-tribal art became greatly influenced by Greek Art, and the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups copied some Greek Art. Romans subdued Greek colonial cities in the 3rd century BC. They have imposed organization based on the military-economical system. Furthermore, Romans subdued Illyrians in the 1st century BC and organized the entire coastal territory by transforming citadels into urban cities. After that the history of these parts is a history of Illyrian provinces of Roman Empire. Numerous rustic villas, and new urban settlements (the most impressive are Verige in Brijuni, Pula and Trogir - formerly Tragurion) demonstrate high level of Roman urbanization. There have been at least thirty urban cities in Istria, Liburnia and Dalmatia with Roman citizenship (civitas). The best- preserved nets of Roman streets (decumanus/cardo) are those in Epetion (Poreč) and Jader (Zadar). The most entirely preserved Roman monuments are in Pola (Pula); founded in the 1st century dedicated to Julius Caesar, it is full with classical Roman art as: stonewalls, two city gates, two temples on Forum, and remains of two theatres, as well as the Arch from year 30 AD, and the temple of August build in years 2 to 14 AD, and finally the Fluvian Amphitheatre (so called – Arena) from the 2nd century. In the 3rd century AD, the city of Salona becomes the largest (it had 40,000 inhabitants) and the most important city of Dalmatia. Near the city emperor Diocletian, born in Salona, build the Palace (around year 300 AD), which is largest and most important monument of late antique architecture in the World. On its pathways, cellars, domes, mausoleums, arcades and courtyards one can trace numerous different art influences from the entire Empire. Some of the sculptures are: the head of a boy, girl and a woman from Salona, monumental figure of Minerva from Varaždin, the head of Hercules from Sinj, sculptures of Roman emperors from Nin and Vid near Metković, damaged sculpture of emperor in Zagreb Museum etc. In the 4th century Salona became the center of Christianity for entire western Balkans. It had numerous basilicas and necropolises, and even two saints: Domnius (Duje) and Anastasius (Staš). One of few preserved basilicas in western Europe (besides ones in Ravenna) from the time of early Byzantium is Euphrasian Basilica in Poreč from the 6th century. The early Middle Ages brought the great migration of the Slavs and this period was perhaps a Dark Age in the cultural sense until the successful formation of the Slavic states which coexisted with Italic cities that remained on the coast, each of them were modelled like Venice.

Medieval Croatian art  = Early Middle Ages = The pleter with inscription of king Držislav, Kapitul in today's Knin, 10th century The term Middle Ages, in Western Europe, designates the period following the decline of the Roman Empire through the 13th century. Early Middle Ages (Pre-Romanesque) covers the time from 7th to the end of the 10th century. In the 7th century the Croats, with other Slavs and Avars, came from Northern Europe to the region where they live today. They were on the level of Iron Age nomadic culture, so they did not know how to enjoy the advantages of urban cities. the country side around Roman cities rivers (like Jadro near Roman Salona). Croatian dignitary, 11th century, Knin area The Croats were open to Roman art and culture, and first of all to Christianity. First churches were built as royal sanctuaries, and influences of Roman art was strongest in Dalmatia where urbanization was thickest, and there was the largest number of monuments. Gradually that influence was neglected and certain simplification, alteration of inherited forms and even creation of original buildings appeared. All of them (dozen large ones and hundreds of small ones) were built with roughly cut stone (natively called – lomljenac) bounded with a thick layer of \\"malter\\" from outside. Large churches are longitudinal with one or three naves like the Church of Holy Salvation on spring of river Cetina and the Church of Saint Cross near Nin, both built in the 9th century. The latter has strong semi-circular buttresses that give a feeling of fortification, emphasizing the bell-tower positioned in front of the entrance. Smaller churches are unusually shaped (mainly central) with several apses. The largest and most complicated central based church from the 9th century is St Donatus in Zadar. Around its circular center – with dome above – is nave in shape of a ring with three apses directed to the east; that shape is followed on the second floor forming a gallery. From those times, with its size and beauty one can only compare the chapel of Charlemagne in Aachen. Altar fence and windows of those churches were highly decorated with transparent shallow string-like ornament that is called pleter - Croatian interlace - because the strings were threaded and rethreaded through themselves. Motifs of those reliefs were taken from Roman art (waves, three- string interlace, pentagrams, net of rhomboids etc.), but while in the Roman art they only made the frame of a sculpture in Dark Ages it fills entire surface. Those reliefs were vividly colored (red, blue and yellow), and because the paintings from that period are not preserved (it is known they existed because they were mentioned in written sources as liturgical from Split, 8th-11th centuries), they remain the only remains of old-Croatian painting. Illuminated page from Vekenega's evangelistary, c. 1096 Sometimes the figures from Bible appeared alongside this decoration, like relief in Holy Nedjeljica in Zadar, and then they were subdued by their pattern. That happened to engravings in early Croatian script – Glagolitic. Soon, the \\"Glagolitic\\" writing was replaced with Latin on altar fences and architraves of old-Croatian churches. Those inscriptions usually mention to whom the church was dedicated, who build it and when it was built, as well who produced the building. That was the way that \\"barbarian newcomers\\" could fit amongst the Romanised natives. From Crown Church of King Zvonimir (so-called Hollow Church in Solin) comes to the altar board with the figure of the Croatian King on the throne with Carolingian crown, servant by his side and subject bowed to the king. Linear cuts representing lines on the robes are similar to lines on their frontal faces, and also on those of a frame. Today the board is a part of Split cathedral baptistery. Out of artistically applied objects, there are many reliquaries preserved. They were adored and believed to have magical powers of healing. They were usually shaped as the part of body that was in them. That's why the relic of Saint James's head in Zadar is shaped in form of a head; the tube part has section with stream of arcades with single saint in every one, while a dome-like cover is decorated with medallions bearing symbols of evangelist and Christ on the top. By uniting with the Hungarian state in the 12th century, Croatia lost its independence, but it did not lose its ties with the south and the west, and instead, this ensured the beginning of a new era of Central European cultural influence. =Romanesque art= Wooden door of the Split Cathedral by the sculptor Andrija Buvina around 1210. Early Romanesque art appeared in Croatia at the beginning of the 11th century with the strong development of monasteries and reform of the church. In that period many valuable monuments and artifacts were made. They can be found mainly alongside Croatian coast and nearby lands: Istria, Dalmatia, and Primorje; while artifacts and monuments from Croatian north are scarce. In the 11th century, the monumental cities were built along the entire Dalmatian coast. Houses were out of stone, on ground floor there were shops or dinners (natively – konoba) like in cities as: Poreč, Rab, Zadar, Trogir and Split. In them the most important buildings were churches. They were commonly stone- built basilicas with three naves, three apses, columns, arches, arcades and wooden roofs; build near monasteries of Benedictian monks who came out of Italy. St. Peter in Supetarska Draga on the island of Rab (11th century) is the best-preserved church of that type in Croatia. On the same island is Cathedral of Rab (12th century) that has high-Romanesque bell tower, largest in Dalmatia. It is specific with its openings, which are multiplied as one goes higher floor by floor (Latin: mono-fore, bi-fore, tri-fore, quadro-fore); typical for Romanesque, but also architecturally smart because it makes every next floor a bit lighter than the preceding one. Cathedral of St. Anastasia, Zadar (natively - St. Stošija) in Zadar (13th century) is marked outside by a string of blind arch-niches on both sides and on frontal side where it also has two Rose windows with radial columns and three portals. Inside it has three naves, slim columns that are supporting a gallery, and flat figurative reliefs. Portal of the Trogir cathedral by sculptor Radovan, c. 1240 In Croatian Romanesque sculpture, there was a transformation of decorative interlace relief (natively – pleter) to figurative, which is found on stone ceilings. At the end of the Romanesque period, in Istria, there were workshops of monumental figures. They had geometrical and naturalistic features reminiscent of gothic. The best examples of Romanesque sculpture are the wooden doors of the Split cathedral done by Andrija Buvina (c. 1220) and the stone portal of the Trogir cathedral done by artisan Radovan (c. 1240). the Main portal of Trogir cathedral, done by artisan Radovan, is the greatest and the most important monument of medieval sculpture in Croatia. It consists out of four parts: surrounding, on doorjamb, are naked sculptures of Adam and Eve on both sides, carried by lions; and inside are numerous reliefs with every- day scenes organized in monthly calendar, and scenes from hunting; and finally in the middle are scenes from the life of Christ: from Annunciation to Resurrection – positioned in arches around tympanum. Finally, in tympanum is the Birth of Christ. The way the figures are formed is very realistic, calling on new gothic humanism, on the trail of the highest achievements of French sculpture (of that in Chartres). Radovan is oriented toward human counterpart in art; best seen in selection of main scene in the tympanum – instead of the usual Romanesque motif of Last Judgement he had chosen The Nativity. Romanesque painting is on walls, on board and in books – illumination. Early frescoes are numerous and best preserved in Istria. The mixing of influences of Eastern and Western Europe is evidenced on them, for example, flat, linear drapes and round red circles on their cheeks. Paintings on board are usually Madonna with Child and painted Crucifixions. The oldest miniatures are from the 13th century – Evangelical book from Split and Trogir. =Gothic art= The Gothic art in the 14th century was supported by a culture of city councils, preaching orders (like Franciscans), and knightly culture. It was the golden age of free Dalmatian cities that were trading with Croatian feudal nobility in the continent. Urban organization and evolution of Dalmatian cities can be followed through the continued development and expansion of Rab and Trogir, the regulation of streets in Dubrovnik, and the integration of Split. It was also when streets in this region were paved with stone, sewage canals were re-developed (the Byzantine Empire retained flushing toilettes, whereas this technology was lost in Roman Catholic Europe), and communal facilities were re-established. Bartol Krbavac in 1402. The largest urban project of those times in Dalmatia was the complete design of two new towns – Small and Large Ston. The most important feature of those towns was a city wall which was about a kilometer of wall with guard towers along the walls built in the 14th Century. Hadrian's wall in Scotland is the longest wall in Europe, and these walls are of similar importance in the Balkans. With these walls the entire Pelješac Peninsula was surrounded and protected from the Adriatic Coast and from the landward part of the cities with an aim to protect the most valuable possession of the Republic of Dubrovnik – salt from Ston. Gothic fortification can be differentiated by its high towers in the shape of a square prism from simple Romanesque ones or round Renaissance ones. The best-preserved ones in Croatia are Istria (Hum, Bale, Motovun, Labin etc.) and those on north (Medvedgrad above Zagreb from year 1260) or on the south Sokolac in Lika (14th century). Franciscan church in Pula built in 1285, is the most representative example of Early Gothic architecture in Croatia. Simple one-nave building with the wooden rib-vault ceiling, with square apse and high stained glass windows, was built from the 13th to 15th centuries. Tatars destroyed Romanesque cathedral in Zagreb during their scourge in 1240, but right after their departure, Zagreb received the title of Free City (Freistadt Zagreb) from King Béla IV. Soon after bishop Timotej began to rebuild the cathedral in new Gothic style. Building with three naves, polygonal apses and rib-vault had Romanesque round towers. The naves were built in the 14th century, and the vault was finished in the 15th. With the arrival of Turks in the 16th century, high walls and towers surrounded it. Only one tower was finished in the 17th century, while in the 18th the Baroque roof became the landmark of the entire city. With the restoration in the 19th century in Neo-Gothic style it lost its former harmony. Hrvoje's liturgy written by Butko in Split, 1404. During the 14th century, the Split cathedral of St Duje and cloister of Franciscan monastery in Dubrovnik were also built. Early Gothic sculpture is represented by already mentioned Radovan's Portal in Trogir. The Church of St Mark in Zagreb was built in 14th and 15th centuries in Late Gothic style. In that manner was also the main portal with portraits of St Mark, Christ, Madonna and 12 apostles with slightly rounded heads and softly drapes on their clothes. Originally the entire portal was vividly colored as can be seen by the remains of colors on wooden figures. In those days, Zadar was a Venetian city. The most beautiful examples of Gothic humanism in Zadar are reliefs in gilded metal as in Arc of St Simon by an artisan from Milan in 1380. On the arc, by the scenes of saints' life (finding of the body in monastery's cluster, saving the ship in storm etc.) there are historical ones as entering of King Ludovik in Zadar or the oath of his wife Elizabeth of Bosnia over the saints' grave. Gothic painting is less preserved, and finest works are in Istria as fresco-cycle of Vincent from Kastv in Church of Holy Mary in Škriljinah near Beram, from 1474. Characters are tangible, three-dimensional in the illusion of space. By the scenes from the life of Christ there is also The March of the Dead (The Dance of Death), which is humanistic, late gothic theme, very popular in Renaissance. Paolo Veneziano was the greatest painter of the Adriatic in the 14th century. His works were mixture of Byzantine iconography and Gothic idealisation. He worked on the icons in Krk, Rab, Zadar, and Trogir. In Dubrovnik, he has done a masterpiece - Dubrovnik Crucifixion. From that times are the two of the best and most decorated illuminated liturgies done by monks from Split, – Hvals' Zbornik (today in Zagreb) and Misal of Bosnian duke Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić (now in Istanbul).  Renaissance  Clovio's Farnese Hours, 1546. In the late 16th - 17th century, Croatia was divided between three states – northern Croatia was a part of the Habsburg monarchy, Dalmatia was under the rule of Venetian Republic (with exception of Dubrovnik) and Slavonia was under Ottoman occupation. Dalmatia was on the periphery of several influences, just as far from Italy as from Ottomans in Bosnia and Austrians in the north, so it thrived from all. In those circumstances in Dalmatia flourished religious and public architecture with a clear influence of Italian renaissance, but still original. Three works out of that period are of European importance, and will contribute to further development of Renaissance: Cathedral of St James in Šibenik, Chapel of Blessed John in Trogir, and Sorkočević's villa in Dubrovnik. Only in the kind of environment, free of dogmas and self-governed - far of major governing centers, could it be possible for artisan known as Juraj Dalmatinac to build a church entirely by his own project – Cathedral of St. James in Šibenik, in 1441. Besides mixing Gothic and Renaissance style it was also original because it used stone and montage construction. What these terms mean is that big stone blocks, pilasters, and ribs were bounded by joints with slots on them without concrete in the way that was usual in wooden constructions. This was unique architecture with the so-called three-leaf frontal and half-barrel vaults, the first in Europe. The cathedral and its original stone dome was finished by Nikola Firentinac following the original plans of Juraj. On the cathedral, there is a coronal of 72 sculpture portraits on the outside wall of the apses. Juraj himself did 40 of them, and all are unique with original characteristics on their faces. Renaissance star-shaped fortress in Karlovac (designed in 1579) Work on Šibenik cathedral inspired Nicola for his work on the expansion of Chapel of Blessed John from Trogir in 1468. Just like Šibenik cathedral, it was composed out of large stone blocks with extreme precision. In cooperation with the student of Juraj Dalmatinac, Andrija Aleši, Nicola has achieved unique harmony of architecture and sculpture according to antique ideals. From inside, there is no flat wall. In the middle of the chapel, on the altar, lies the sarcophagus of blessed John of Trogir. Surrounding are reliefs of puttos carrying torches that look like they were peeping out of doors of Underworld. Above them there are niches with sculptures of Christ and apostles, amongst them are putties, circular windows encircled with fruit garland, and a relief of Nativity. All is ceiled with coffered ceiling with the image of God in the middle and 96 portrait heads of angels. With so many faces of smiling children, the chapel looks very cheerful and there is not anything similar in European art of that time. In the entire area of Republic of Dubrovnik there were numerous villas of nobility, due to their functionality and organization as combinations of renaissance villa and government building. Sorkočević's villa in Lapad near Dubrovnik in 1521 is original because of building parts in asymmetrical, dynamic balance. Renaissance sculptures are linked to some architecture, and the most beautiful one is perhaps relief Flagellation of Christ by Juraj Dalmatinac on the altar of St Staš in Split cathedral. Three almost naked figures are caught in vibrant movement. The most important renaissance painters from Dubrovnik are: Lovro Dobričević, Mihajlo Hamzić and Nikola Božidarević. They painted the altar screens with first hints of portraits in characters, linear perspective and even still life motifs. In Northwestern Croatia, the beginning of the wars with the Ottoman Empire caused many problems but in the long term, it both reinforced the northern of the ruling Habsburgs. There was the modest influence of the Renaissance in styles of fortification. The plan for the fortified city of Karlovac in 1579 was the first radially built city in the Balkan Peninsula using the so-called \\"ideal city\\" plan like is found afterward in Renaissance and Baroque Europe (See Baroque). The Muslim Turk Ottomans were a constant threat from the South and East and hindered the over-all development of Serbo-Croatian expression in the region. The renaissance fort of the Ratkay family in Veliki Tabor from the 16th century has mixed features of Gothic architecture (high roofs) and renaissance (cluster and round towers) making it an example of Mannerism. Some of the famous renaissance artists that lived and worked in other countries, like brothers Laurana (In Croatian - Vranjanin, Franjo and Luka), miniaturist Juraj Klović and famous mannerist painter Andrija Medulić (teacher of El Greco).  Baroque and Rococo  In the 17th and 18th century Croatia was reunited with the parts of the country that were occupied by Venetian Republic and Ottoman Empire. The unity attributed to the sudden flourishing of art in every segment. In northern Croatia and Slavonia sprung out numerous and worthy works of Baroque art – from urban plans and large forts to churches, palaces, public buildings and monuments, all were done in Baroque style. Large fortifications with a radial plan, ditches and numerous towers were built because of constant Ottoman threat. The two largest ones were Osijek and Slavonski Brod. Later they become large cities. They were fortified with water and earth – earth mounds with cannons and canals filled with water that was supposed to slow down the approaching enemies. The fort of Slavonski Brod was the largest in all Croatia, and one of the largest ones in entire Europe because it was bounding fort of Europe toward Ottoman Empire. Urban planning of Baroque is felt in numerous new towns like Karlovac, Bjelovar, Koprivnica, Virovitica etc. that had large straight streets, rectangular squares in the middle surrounded with buildings as government and military ones as well as representative church. Painting from the altar of Zagreb Cathedral, dated c. 1690, usually attributed to Bernardo Bobić Cities of Dalmatia also got baroque towers and bastions incorporated in their old walls, like the ones in Pula, Šibenik or Hvar. But biggest Baroque undertaking happened in Dubrovnik in the 17th century after the catastrophic earthquake in 1667 when the almost entire city was destroyed. In Baroque style were rebuilt the church of St Vlaho on the main square (1715), Main Cathedral and Jesuit college with church of St Ignatius. Paolo Passalaqua united several of those baroque masterpieces with his Jesuit Stairway. That beautiful wide stone stairway with series of convexities and concavities and strong balustrade (reminiscent of famous Spain Stairway Square in Rome) actually connected two separate baroque parts of the city - the Jesuit church above and Ivan Gundulić Square below. During the Baroque numerous churches, enchanting us with their size and form were built in all Croatia, thus becoming a crown in every town or a city. The monastery churches often had an enclosing wall with inner porches lavishly decorated, like in Franciscan monastery in Slavonski Brod where the columns are as thick as baroque abundance. The most beautiful one is probably the church in Selima near Sisak. It has an oval shape with elliptic dome and concave and convex front with two according to towers. But most luxuriant is the church of Maria of the Snow in Belec from 1740 with the entire interior filled with lively gilded wooden sculptures, frescoes of painter Ivan Ranger from Austria. Ranger was classic Rococo painter whose characters were softly painted in graceful positions and optimism of cheerful colors. He also lavishly painted the gothic church in Lepoglava, and ceiling of Banqueting Hall of Bistra Palace (one of most beautiful elliptic plans in profane architecture). Wall painting experienced flourishing in all parts of Croatia, from illusionist frescoes in church of Holy Mary in Samobor, St Catherine in Zagreb to Jesuit church in Dubrovnik. Best preserved ones are Rococo frescoes in Miljana mansion where allegorical seasons and natural elements were depicted through human nature and his reflection on art. Baroque towers and bastions were incorporated into the old walls of Dalmatian cities, like the ones in Pula, Šibenik or Hvar. The biggest Baroque undertaking in Dalmatia happened in Dubrovnik in the 17th Century after the catastrophic earthquake of 1667 when almost the entire city was destroyed. In Baroque style were rebuilt Church of St Vlaho on the main square in 1715, the Catholic Main Cathedral, as well as the Jesuit college and its accompanying church of St Ignatius. Paolo Passalaqua united several of those baroque masterpieces with his Jesuit Stairway. The wide stone stairway was built with a series of convexities, concavities and a strong balustrade (reminiscent of famous Spain Stairway Square in Rome) thereby connecting two parts of the city, using Baroque style, which were the Jesuit church above and the Ivan Gundulić Square below. During the Baroque numerous Catholic churches crowned most towns in cities due to their large size and opulence. The Roman Catholic monastery churches often had an enclosing wall with inner porches lavishly decorated, like in the Franciscan monastery in Slavonski Brod where the columns are thick showing baroque abundance. The most beautiful one is probably the Roman Catholic church in Selima near Sisak. It has an oval shape with an elliptic dome and concave and convex front with two towers. In a very luxuriant Roman Catholic church, Maria of the Snow in Belec from 1740 the entire interior is filled with lively gilded wooden sculptures, frescoes by painter Ivan Ranger from the Roman Catholic Habsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire. Ranger was a classic Rococo painter whose characters were softly painted in graceful positions with optimism and cheerful colors. He also lavishly painted the Roman Catholic Gothic church in Lepoglava, and the ceiling of the Banqueting Hall of Bistra Palace which is one of most beautiful elliptic plans in profane architecture. An exchange of artists between Croatia and other parts of Europe happened. The most famous Croatian painter was Federiko Benković who worked almost his entire life in Italy, while an Italian – Francesco Robba, did the best Baroque sculptures in Croatia. His most beautiful and moving work is marble altar of Crucifixion in Church of Holy Cross in Križevci. Beside masterly carved body of Christ, there is a theme of Abraham's Sacrifice; it is a diagonal composition in anxious tension with several movements of limbs and drapes. Located beside the master marble work of the body of Christ there is a theme of Abraham's Sacrifice of Isaac. The Sacrifice of Isaac is portrayed in a diagonal composition with anxious tension articulated by several movements of limbs and drapes.  The 19th century  The Toast by Vlaho Bukovac In Austrian countries on the beginning of the 19th century (to which Croatia belonged than) building in Classicistic Manner prevailed. In Croatia most prominent architect was Bartol Felbinger who also built City Hall in Samobor (1826) and Januševac Castle near Zagreb. Romantic movement in Croatia was sentimental, gentle and subtle – the real image of bourgeoisie's humble and modest virtues. In architecture, there were simple decorations made of the shallow arch like niches around windows, while the furniture was of mildly bent Biedermeier furniture, and even in dressing the cheaper materials with cheerful colors prevailed. So, it is no surprise that instead of representative portraits in Croatia miniature portraits are preferred. At the end of the 19th century, architect Hermann Bolle undertook one of the largest projects of European historicism – a half-kilometer-long neo-renaissance arcade with twenty domes on Zagreb cemetery Mirogoj. Portrait of Mrs. Krešić by Vjekoslav Karas from 1856 At the same time, the cities in Croatia got an important urban makeover. But for size and importance, the urban regulation of Downtown Zagreb (largely the work of Milan Lenuzzio, 1860–1880) was revolutionary. Between Zagreb's longest street – Ilica, and new railway the new geometrical city was built with large public and social buildings like neo-renaissance building of Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts (HAZU - learned society promoting language, culture, and science from its first conception in 1836; the juxtaposition of the words typically seen in English as \\"Arts and Sciences\\" is deliberate, F. Scmidt, 1884), neo-baroque Croatian National Theatre (HNK, H. Helmer and F. Fellner, 1895), and to that date very modern Art Pavilion (1898) with montage construction of steel and glass – Croatian \\"Crystal Palace\\", and finally the masterpiece of Art Nouveau – The National Library (Lubinski, finished in 1912). This urban plan is bounded by series of parks and parkways decorated with numerous fountains, sculptures, avenues and gardens (known as \\"Green Horseshoe\\") making Zagreb one of the first cities built according to new European art theory of \\"city as a work of art\\". Oton Iveković, The Croats arrival at the Adriatic Sea The pseudo building that emphasizes all three visual arts is the former building of Ministry of Prayer and Education in Zagreb (H. Bolle, 1895). Along with rooms in Pompeii style and renaissance cabinet, the large neo-baroque \\"Golden Hall\\" was painted with historic compositions by Bela Čikoš-Sesija (The Baptism of Croats and Split Council), Oton Iveković (Meeting of Koloman and Croatian Nobility), Mato Celestin Medović (The Arrival of Croats), Vlaho Bukovac (Frantz Joseph in Zagreb) and decorated with reliefs by Robert Frangeš- Mihanović. \\"The Golden Hall\\" becomes a unified monument of its age, one of few in Europe. Realism appeared in bourgeois portraits by Vjekoslav Karas. The characters of his portraits are true expressions of their time. Realistic landscapes are linked to certain parts of the country – Slavonian forests by artists of Osijek school, Dubrovnik in works of Celestin Medović, and Dalmatian coast in works of Menci Klement Crnčić. In sculpture the hard realism (naturalism) of Ivan Rendić was replaced by art nouveau composed and moving reliefs by Robert Frangeš-Mihanović. Slava Raškaj is particularly notable for her watercolorworks. Vlaho Bukovac brought the spirit of impressionism from Paris, and he strongly influenced the young artists (including the authors of \\"Golden Hall\\"). Right after he painted the screen in HNK in Zagreb with the theme of Croatian Illyrian Movement, and symbolic portraits of Croatian Writers in National Library, he founded The Society of Croatian Artists (1897), the so-called \\"Zagreb's colorful school\\". With this society the Croatian Modern Art started. On the Millennium Exhibition in Budapest they were able to set aside all other artistic options in Austria- Hungary.  The 20th century  Self-portrait with Dog (Autoportret sa psom) by Miroslav Kraljević (1910) Modern Gallery, Zagreb Modern art in Croatia began with the secessionist ideas spreading from Vienna and Munich, and post- impressionism from Paris. The Munich Circle used values to create volume in their paintings, in a style much simplified from more detailed earlier, academic style. The Medulic Society of sculptors and painters from Split brought themes of national history and legends to their art, and some of the artwork following the First World War contained a strong political message against the ruling Austro-Hungarian state. The Zagreb Spring Salon provided an annual showcase of the local art scene, and a big change was noticeable in 1919 with a move to flatter forms, and signs of cubism and expressionism were evident. The avant-garde Zenit Group of the 1920s pushed for integrating the new art forms with the native cultural identity. At the same time, the Earth Group sought to reflect reality and social issues in their art, a movement that also saw the development of naive art. The 1930s saw a return to more simple, classical styles. Following the Second World War, artists everywhere were searching for meaning and identity, leading to abstract expressionism in the U.S. and art informel in Europe. In the new Yugoslavia, the communist social realism style never took hold, but Exat 51 showed the way with geometric abstraction in paintings and simplified spaces in architecture. The Gorgona Group of the 1960s advocated non-conventional forms of visual expression, published their own anti-magazine, and were preoccupied by the absurd. At the same time, the New Tendencies series of exhibits held in conjunction with meetings displayed a more analytical approach to art, and a move towards New Media, such as photography, video, computer art, performance art and installations, focused more on the artists' process. The Biafra Group of the 1970s was figurative and expressionist, engaging their audience directly. By the 1980s, the New Image movement brought a return to more traditional painting and images.

Bounded by the Narmada River to the north and the Godavari River to the southeast, tribal peoples occupy the slopes of the region's mountains. The term \\"Scheduled Tribes\\" refers to specific indigenous peoples whose status is acknowledged to by the Constitution of India. The term Adivasi also applies to indigenous peoples of this area.  Diversity of tribes  The diversity in the tribes across the state comes from differences in heredity, lifestyle, cultural traditions, social structure, economic structure, religious beliefs and language and speech. Due to the different linguistic, cultural and geographical environments, the diverse tribal world of Madhya Pradesh has been largely cut off from the mainstream of development. Madhya Pradesh holds 1st rank among all the States/Union Territories (UTs) in terms of Special Tribal population and 12th rank in respect of the proportion of ST population to total population.

The Williamson Baronetcy, of East Markham in the County of Nottingham, was created in the Baronetage of England on 3 June 1642 for Thomas Williamson. He was a supporter of the Royalist cause in the Civil War, which loyalty resulted in the sequestration of all his Nottinghamshire estates, for which he compounded at a cost of £3400. The family removed to County Durham as a consequence of marriage and from the 18th century the family seat was Whitburn Hall, near Sunderland ( the house was demolished in 1980). The fourth Baronet served as High Sheriff of Durham 1723–1747. The fifth (1747–88) and sixth Baronets (1789–1810) also served in that office. The seventh Baronet sat as Whig Member of Parliament (MP) for County Durham 1831-2, and Sunderland 1847 and was High Sheriff in 1840. The eighth Baronet represented Durham North in the House of Commons 1864–74. The ninth Baronet was High Sheriff in 1904. The title became extinct on the death of the eleventh Baronet in 2000.

Heller is known for his work on time dependent quantum mechanics, and also for producing digital art based on the results of his numerical calculations. Early life and education Heller's father was the economist Walter Heller, architect of the first tax cut motivated by fiscal policy, under John F Kennedy. Heller received his BS from the University of Minnesota in 1968, and his PhD in Chemical Physics in 1973 from Harvard University, where he worked with William Reinhardt. Heller was a postdoc at the University of Chicago with Stuart Rice, after which he joined the faculty at the University of California, Los Angeles. Career Heller was a member of the Chemistry faculty at UCLA from 1976 to 1982. In 1981, Heller took a sabbatical at Los Alamos National Laboratory and then stayed on as a staff scientist until 1984 when he accepted a faculty position in Chemistry at the University of Washington. In 1993, Heller returned to Harvard as Professor of Physics and director of the Institute for Theoretical Atomic and Molecular Physics (ITAMP) (1993–1998). In 1998, Heller stepped down as ITAMP director to assume a joint appointment to the Harvard University Chemistry department. His present position is Abbott and James Lawrence Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Physics at Harvard University. Heller is an elected member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Philosophical Society. Heller has received the American Chemical Society Award in Theoretical Chemistry (2005), the Astor Fellowship at Oxford (2005) and the Joseph O. Hirschfelder Prize (2003). Heller has been a Sloan Fellow, a Humboldt Fellow, a fellow of the American Physical Society, and a Guggenheim Fellow, and is the coauthor of over 280 publications. =Research= Heller pioneered a time-dependent wavepacket picture of quantum mechanics, which allowed the excited-state dynamics of large quantum mechanical systems to be understood without calculating eigenstates. Heller's work laid the foundations for a theoretical understanding of femtochemistry. He and postdoc Soo-ying Lee developed the time-dependent approach to resonance Raman spectroscopy. Heller has also made contributions to methodology, suggesting the technique called \\"frozen Gaussians\\"—today the most widely used semiclassical initial value representation (IVR) method of wavepacket propagation. In physics, Heller is known for his work on quantum chaos, particularly on scar theory. Heller's more recent work has focused on the study of two dimensional electron gases, quantum mirages in quantum corrals, scattering theory, few-body quantum mechanics, semiclassical methods, and freak waves in the ocean. Many (though not all) of these studies make use of the time-dependent quantum mechanics ideas from his earlier work. Publications Heller published a book called Why You Hear What You Hear on acoustics and psychoacoustics (Princeton, 2013). Ostensibly a textbook, it contains many new perspectives on acoustics, including of musical instruments and voice. The psychoacoustics of pitch perception forms the longest chapter. In June, 2018 a second book authored by Heller was published by Princeton University Press. Called The Semiclassical Way (to dynamics and spectroscopy), it is about quantum mechanics and classical mechanics and exploiting the computationally useful and helpfully intuitive connections between them. It shares a foundation with Why You Hear What You Hear in that both books are about understanding wave phenomena. Heller is mentioned in the Nebula Award winning novel The Quantum Rose by Catherine Asaro, a science fiction novel based in part on Heller's theories.

The population of the civil parish was 466 at the 2011 Census. Category It is a primarily rural village. Etymology Holme Lacy is not from Old Norse holmr \\"island\\" like other places of the name Holme, but from the fairly similar Old English hamm \\"land in a river-bend\\". The name was recorded as Hamme in the Domesday Book in 1086. The name has varied through history; it has also been known as Homme Lacy (1396) Hamlayce (1648), Humlachie (1701) and Hom Lacy (1836). History The town was an estate of the Bishop of Hereford and held by Roger de Lacy, which is where the \\"Lacy\\" affix comes from. De Lacy was a Lord of the manor, indicating that a feudal system was in existence during the Middle Ages. William I of England had returned Hamme to Bishop Walter and in 1086 the total population included: * 16 villeins * 4 bordars (Villeins of the lowest rank who held a cottage at their lord's pleasure, for which they rendered menial service) * 1 reeve * 1 male and 2 female slaves * 1 priest * and 1 Frenchman who between them had 20½ ploughs. The priest shows there was a church at Holme Lacy. There were also two ploughs under the lordship's tenure in existence. Police force The village comes under the jurisdiction of the West Mercia Constabulary. Holme Lacy House and its estate Holme Lacy House Holme Lacy was for some centuries in the ancient family of Scudamore. Philip Scudamore settled here in the 14th century, and his descendant John Scudamore esq. was created a baronet in 1620, and in 1628 Baron Dromore and Viscount Scudamore, of Sligo. His successor, the second viscount, commissioned Anthony Deane in 1674 to build a new country mansion on the estate. Holme Lacy House continued to be the principal seat of the family till the year 1716, when on the death of James, the 3rd and last Viscount Scudamore, the estate was vested in Frances Scudamore (born 1711-died 1750 in childbed), his only daughter and heiress. In 1729 Frances married Henry Somerset 3rd Duke of Beaufort, who in 1730 assumed the name and arms of Scudamore. Frances was divorced in 1744 and there were no children of the marriage. Frances then married as her second husband Charles Fitzroy esq. He also assumed the name and arms of Scudamore, and had by her an only daughter and heiress, Frances (1750-1820). Frances married Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk to whom the property then in part descended, and, together with other valuable estates in this county and Gloucestershire, was added to the princely domain of the Howards. The Duke and Duchess died without surviving children and after extensive litigation the Holme Lacy estate devolved in 1819 upon Capt. Sir Edwyn Francis Stanhope, Bart., R. N., who assumed the additional name and arms of Scudamore and whose son succeeded in 1883 as 9th Earl of Chesterfield.Kelly's Directory of Herefordshire 1890 - edited The mansion of Holme Lacy built by the 2nd Viscount Scudamore remained, renovated in 1828-31 and again in the early 20th century, the family seat of the Earls of Chesterfield until 1902, when the contents were sold. In 1909 the house was sold to Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth, an Australian brewing millionaire. He sold it in 1924 to Noel Wills, on whose death in 1929 his widow donated it to Herefordshire County Council. For some years it was used as a training college and psychiatric hospital. Several owners later it was leased to the Warner Leisure Hotels group.

While the work by Rodham as a college student was the subject of much speculation in articles and biographies of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 1990s, access to the thesis was limited by the college, at the request of the Clinton White House, during her time as first lady.  Thesis  Rodham researched the thesis by interviewing Alinsky and others, and by conducting visits to low-income areas of Chicago (nearby to her hometown, Park Ridge, Illinois) and observing Community Action Programs in those areas.Carl Bernstein, A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton. Knopf, 2007, , p. 57. Her thesis adviser was Wellesley professor of political science Alan Schechter. The thesis was sympathetic to Alinsky's critiques of government antipoverty programs, but criticized Alinsky's methods as largely ineffective, all the while describing Alinsky's personality as appealing. The thesis sought to fit Alinsky into a line of American social activists, including Eugene V. Debs, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Walt Whitman. Written in formal academic language, the thesis concluded that \\"[Alinsky's] power/conflict model is rendered inapplicable by existing social conflicts\\" and that Alinsky's model had not expanded nationally due to \\"the anachronistic nature of small autonomous conflict\\". A 2007 New York Times review of Rodham's thesis summarized her views as follows: \\"Ms. Rodham endorsed Mr. Alinsky's central critique of government antipoverty programs — that they tended to be too top-down and removed from the wishes of individuals. But the student leader split with Mr. Alinsky over a central point. He vowed to 'rub raw the sores of discontent' and compel action through agitation. This, she believed, ran counter to the notion of change within the system.\\" In 2016, reporter Michael Kruse quotes the thesis and describes a centrist theme: In the acknowledgements and end notes of the thesis, Rodham thanked Alinsky for two interviews and a job offer. She declined the latter, saying that \\"after spending a year trying to make sense out of [Alinsky's] inconsistency, I need three years of legal rigor.\\" The thesis was praised by all four of its reviewers and Rodham, an honors student at Wellesley, received an A grade on it.Bill Dedman, \\"Reading Hillary Rodham's hidden thesis: Clinton White House asked Wellesley College to close off access\\", msnbc.com, March 2, 2007. Accessed September 25, 2018.  White House and Wellesley limiting of access  The work was unnoticed until Hillary Rodham Clinton entered the White House as first lady. Clinton researchers and political opponents sought it out, contending it contained evidence that Rodham had held strong far-left or socialist views. In early 1993, the White House requested that Wellesley not release the thesis to anyone. Wellesley complied, instituting a new rule that closed access to the thesis of any sitting U.S. president or First lady, a rule that in practice applied only to Rodham.Bill Dedman, \\"How the Clintons wrapped up Hillary's thesis: 'A stupid political decision,' says her former Wellesley poli-sci professor\\", msnbc.com, March 2, 2007.

Warner Books, 1993, , p. 77. David Brock was similarly unable to access the thesis for his book The Seduction of Hillary Rodham (1996), writing that it was \\"under lock and key\\". Instead, he, too, used some of Schechter's recollections.David Brock, The Seduction of Hillary Rodham. Free Press, 1996, , p. 17. By the mid-1990s, Clinton critics seized upon the restricted access as a sure sign that the thesis held politically explosive contents that would reveal her hidden radicalism or extremism.Michael Levenson, \\"A student's words, a candidate's struggle\\", The Boston Globe, March 4, 2007. Accessed July 14, 2007.Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, Jr., Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton. Little, Brown and Co., 2007, , p. 33.

Writing in their \\"Washington Merry-Go-Round\\" column, they surmised that the thesis's conclusion might be at variance with Clinton Administration policies, saying they had \\"discovered the subject of her thesis: a criticism of Lyndon B. Johnson's 'War on Poverty' programs. Mrs. Clinton's conclusion? Community- based anti-poverty programs don't work.\\" Clinton biographer Barbara Olson wrote in her 1999 book Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton that, \\"The contents of Hillary's thesis, and why she would want it hidden from public view, have long been the subject of intense interest. Most likely, she does not want the American people to know the extent to which she internalized and assimilated the beliefs and methods of Saul Alinsky.\\"Barbara Olson, Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton. Regnery Publishing, 1999, , pp. 45–46. In her memoir Living History (2003), Clinton mentioned the thesis only briefly, saying she had agreed with some of Alinsky's ideas but had not agreed with his belief that it was impossible to \\"change the system\\" from inside.Hillary Rodham Clinton, Living History. Simon & Schuster, 2003, , p. 38. Years after the Clintons left the White House, the thesis still held its allure. For example, in 2005, columnist Peggy Noonan speculated that it was \\"the Rosetta Stone\\" of Hillary biographies defining \\"how to change the American political culture\\".Peggy Noonan, \\"Eine Kleine Biographie\\", The Wall Street Journal, June 23, 2005. Accessed March 3, 2007. Clinton staffers still did not discuss why it had been sealed.  Thesis made available  The thesis was made available after the Clintons left the White House in 2001 by the Wellesley College archives. It first received public exposure in 2005 when NBC News investigative reporter Bill Dedman sent his journalism class from Boston University to read the thesis and write articles about it, and one of the students, Rick Heller, posted his article online that December.Rick Heller, \\"Hillary Clinton's Bachelor's Thesis\\", Centerfield Blog, December 19, 2005. Accessed July 9, 2008. Archived June 14, 2011.

The suppression of the thesis from 1993 to 2001 at the request of the Clinton White House was documented in March 2007 by reporter Dedman, who read the thesis at the Wellesley library and interviewed Rodham's thesis adviser. Dedman found that the thesis did not disclose much of Rodham's own views. A Boston Globe assessment found the thesis nuanced, and said that \\"While [Rodham] defends Alinsky, she is also dispassionate, disappointed, and amused by his divisive methods and dogmatic ideology.\\" Schechter told Dedman, writing for msnbc.com, that \\"There Is Only The Fight . . .\\" was a good thesis, and that its suppression by the Clinton White House \\"was a stupid political decision, obviously, at the time.\\" Interest in the thesis and in Clinton's relationship with Alinsky continued during the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries, as Clinton battled Illinois Senator Barack Obama, who had also been reported to have been exposed to Alinsky-style ideas and methods during his time as a Chicago community organizer.Peter Slevin, \\"For Clinton and Obama, a Common Ideological Touchstone\\", The Washington Post, March 25, 2007.

Wears Valley is situated in a valley known as Wear Cove, which runs parallel to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Like other park border communities, the history and economy of the valley are intertwined with that of the Smokies. Both are named after Samuel Wear (1753–1817), a Revolutionary War veteran who erected a fort near the entrance to Wear Cove in what is now Pigeon Forge.  Demographics  As of the census of 2000, there were 6,486 people, 2,585 households, and 1,955 families residing in Wears Valley. The racial makeup of this area was 97.7% White, 0.4% Native American, 0.5% Asian, and 0.5% African American. Hispanics and Latinos comprise 1.8% of the population. Of the 2,585 households, 30.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.6% were married couples living together, 7.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.4% were non-families. 20.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.51 and the average family size was 2.89. 77.8% of the population was 18 years of age or older with 12.3% being 65 years of age or older.

Geography  Cove Mountain rising above Wears Valley Wears Valley is centered at (35.7139, -83.6531). The community covers most of Wear Cove, with the national park boundary comprising the town's entire southern border and the Blount/Sevier county line providing its western border. U.S. Route 321 / Tennessee State Route 73 is the community's main road, connecting Townsend in the west with Pigeon Forge in east, where it merges with U.S. 441. This section of 321/73 is known as \\"Wears Valley Road\\". Line Springs Road connects Wears Valley Road with Little River Road inside the national park, crossing Wear Cove Gap between Cove Mountain and Roundtop and emerging at the Metcalf Bottoms picnic area. Upon entering the park at the gap, it becomes Wear Cove Gap Road, a narrow road without lines, which now provides a shortcut from the park to the new end of the parkway. Since opening in November 2018, this new section of the Foothills Parkway connects Wears Valley to the existing parkway at Walland to the west-northwest. Most of this was already finished (in the 1960s) or nearly so, but the \\"missing link\\" section northeast of Townsend had to be completed with a series of bridges before the section could finally open. The section east of Wears Valley (at 321/73) to Pigeon Forge and beyond is completely unconstructed, and will not occur in the foreseeable future. History =Early settlement= Aaron Crowson's grave at Crowson Cemetery in Wears Valley Wears Valley is named after Samuel Wear (1753–1817), a Revolutionary War veteran who erected a fort near the entrance to the valley in what is now Pigeon Forge. The original name of the valley was \\"Crowson Cove,\\" after its first settler, Aaron Crowson (1774–1849). While no one is sure why its name changed, the valley was using its current name by 1900.Inez Burns, History of Blount County, Tennessee (Nashville: Benson Printing, 1957). Crowson arrived in Wears Valley from North Carolina in 1792 along with his friend, Peter Percefield. This was during a period of elevated strife between the Cherokee and the fast-encroaching Euro- American settlers. Wear's Fort was attacked in 1793, with Wear leading a punitive march against the Cherokee village of Tallassee shortly thereafter. In May 1794, Percefield was killed in a Cherokee attack. Crowson rode to Wear's Fort to get help, but the Cherokee had fled by the time he returned. Several settlers marched onward to Great Tellico to the west, where they killed four Cherokee while they slept. Percefield was buried on a hill in the eastern half of Wear Cove, in what is now Crowson Cemetery. Later that year, Crowson received a land grant for this plot of land.Ida Headrick Myers, \\"Recollections of Wears Valley,\\" The Sevier County News-Record, 1953. (http://www.headrickchapel.org/wears_valley.shtml) Retrieved: July 16, 2007. The Peter Brickey House, constructed ca. 1808 Along with Crowson, other early settlers in Wears Valley included a Revolutionary War veteran named William Headrick (1744–1839), who arrived in 1821, and John Ogle (1788–1841), a War of 1812 veteran and son of the first settlers in Gatlinburg. Another War of 1812 veteran, Peter Brickey (1769–1856), arrived in 1808. Brickey operated a large farm and distillery in the valley until his death in 1856. The log house he built shortly after his arrival still stands in Smith Hollow (between Wears Valley and Townsend) and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.The Center for Historic Preservation, \\"Tennessee Century Farms  Blount County\\" (http://histpres.mtsu.edu/centfarms/blount_county/#Brickey_Farm) Retrieved: July 16, 2007.

Emert, Beulah Linn (editor), \\"The Isaac Trotter Papers,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Newsletter 12, no. 2 (Summer of 1986): 31. Earlier in the war, a Union army passed through the valley en route to dislodge the troops of Will Thomas who were entrenched in Gatlinburg.Beulah Linn, Reunion At the River: Official History of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee 1783-1930 (Pigeon Forge Homecoming '86 Committee, 1986), 10-20. William C. Pickens, a resident of Wears Valley, was one of the so-called bridge-burners, a band of pro-Union guerillas who attempted to destroy several railroad bridges across East Tennessee in November 1861. Pickens led the failed attack on the Strawberry Plains bridge, and was badly wounded in the attack.Oliver Perry Temple, East Tennessee and the Civil War (Cincinnati: Robert Clarke Company, 1899), pp. 381-382.

Sherick and Company, 1887), p. 12. Sometime after the war, Alfred Line (1831–1897) established a farm at the base of Roundtop Mountain, near the southern half of Wear Cove. Line Spring, a clear mountain spring which flows down from the slopes of Roundtop, gave its name to a small recreational area that developed in this part of the cove. In the 1880s and 1890s, mineral-rich mountain springs were thought to have health-restoring qualities, and provided an early form of tourism for the mountain regions. In 1910, D.B. Lawson, the son of a circuit rider who had purchased the Line farm, constructed the Line Spring Hotel. The hotel boosted the valley's economy by providing a market for local farmers. =Religion= Headrick Chapel, constructed in 1902 Around 1800, Crowson and several other settlers erected a crude log church known as the Bethlehem Church. The church was used by both Methodists and Baptists throughout the 19th century, with Baptist services being conducted by an elected pastor and Methodist services being conducted by circuit riders. On occasion, both congregations would meet in a mini-revival known as a \\"union meeting.\\" In 1886, both Baptists and Methodists constructed separate structures, although union meetings were still fairly common. For most of the 19th century, funerals in Wears Valley were held at Headrick Cemetery, near the valley's western entrance. A large oak tree provided shelter for funeral-goers, although cold weather and rain often made apparent the need for a building in which to conduct indoor services. In 1902, according to local lore, the oak tree was destroyed by lightning, and in response, the residents erected Headrick Chapel on the cemetery's grounds. The chapel was shared by four Baptist and Methodist congregations, with funeral services having priority. The chapel's bell would ring once for every year of the deceased's life, a tradition still observed by the inhabitants of Wears Valley. In 2001, Headrick Chapel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.David Frye, \\"Headrick Chapel: Symbol of a Rural East Tennessee Community,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Journal 18, no. 4 (Winter of 2004): 2.

The park's border paralleled Wears Valley to the south, following the crest of Roundtop and Cove Mountain. With improvements to US-321 in the 1950s, tourist outlets began to trickle into Wears Valley. Cabin rentals and outdoor supply stores are among the more common tourism-oriented venues in the valley today. In 2005, a group of developers led by Ron Ogle and Jerry Miller sought to build 400 houses on the slopes of Cove Mountain. This raised concern among many Wears Valley residents over the impact such development might have on Cove Mountain's scenic value. In 2007, Friends of Wears Valley a group opposed to the development unsuccessfully petitioned the Sevier County Regional Planning Commission to block the housing expansion on Cove Mountain. The group has posted \\"Save Our Mountains\\" signs throughout the valley, although the developers insist their plans will not harm the mountain's natural qualities.Craig Mintz, \\"Wears Valley Friends To Meet,\\" The Mountain Press, September 27, 2005.Greg Johnson, \\"Doomsday Development On Cove Mountain,\\" The Knoxville News-Sentinel, May 4, 2007.

After a downed power line ignited the dry foliage in Little Cove Gap, an isolated fire quickly spread, thereby consuming the surrounding structures towards the northern end of Wears Valley. Around 40 homes were destroyed and another 40 were damaged on Hideaway Mountain and Dogwood Farms Mountain. Education Wears Valley is the site of Wearwood Elementary School.

The target may be a physical object or a person. If the target is a person, they may be alone or a member of a group (of which the observer may also be a part) or else in a situation of interpersonal communication. It is based on the way a particular feature can be linked to a certain type of speaker, who is then associated with social and emotional evaluations. These evaluations are then transferred to the linguistic feature. An observer's attention may be drawn to a target as a result of certain general features of that target. These features include: # General object attributes – vivid colors, object's proximity to observer # Difference between object attribute and its immediate environment. # Difference between observer's expectations of an object and the observable attributes of that object. # Observer's goal – an object that matches goal- oriented searching. Social salience allows for observers to quickly detect changes in their environment. Given the limited cognitive capacity of humans, this is advantageous but can lead to biases and misperceptions as in the case of the representativeness heuristic. Awareness of this heuristic does not always completely mitigate its effect. Social salience is also distinguished from cognitive salience in the sense that it consists of the variation along with attitudes, cultural stereotypes, and social values associated with it. In addition, the variation has already been used to carry social indexation. On the other hand, cognitive salience pertains to the objective property of linguistic variation that allows language users to pick up on it.  Social Salience of Objects  While there are colors and patterns that are objectively more vivid, salience is a function of the difference between the target object and its environment, or \\"ground\\". The greater the difference between the target and the ground, the stronger the social salience of that target. In the case of social salience, this distinction is characterized as a comparison between the attributes of the target and the attributes of other items in the target's proximal ground. Other items in the target's proximal ground set the norm for attributes an observer can expect. When an object’s attributes violate those pre-set expectations, it is socially salient. The strength of an object's social salience may also be underscored when it is the target of a goal-oriented search by an observer. An observer looking for a target object is more attuned to the object’s attributes and will be able to pick them out more rapidly from a crowd.  Social Salience of People  The social salience of an individual is a compilation of that individual's salient attributes. These may be changes to dress or physical attributes with respect to a previous point in time or with respect to the surrounding environment Salient attributes of an individual may include the following: # Clothing (e.g., boldly patterned clothing) # Manipulation to physical appearance (e.g., novel hair color) # Accessory that is infrequent in presence across the general population or indicative of an individual change (e.g., a leg brace) The social salience of an individual in a group is defined both by individual salient attributes and comparison with the attributes of other members of the group. As with the salience of objects, the social salience of an individual in a group depends on the attributes of the other members of that group. Little is known about social salience between groups but within-group preferences lead to greater social salience for members of an observer’s own group than for members outside of the group or in a different group. Salient attributes of an individual in a group may include the following: # Activeness # Trustworthiness # Friendliness # Volume of speech # Reliability  Moderators of Social Salience  = Negative Moderators of Social Salience = Machines with multiple channels of communication allow for interpersonal communication among many active parties. Fewer channels lead to a decreased social salience of other members as perceived by any one participant. Compared with direct communication, communication over digital interfaces result in fewer nonverbal cues that provide necessary information as to the relationships between participants (status-specific or otherwise) as well as other social context. As a result, communication over digital interfaces is less personable and less productive than in-person communication. = Positive Moderators of Social Salience = Oxytocin has a positive impact on the awareness of social cues in individuals with social impairment. The release of oxytocin both mediates directly prosocial behavior and increases perception of social salience. The salience of mortality is also an active moderator of social salience. Mechanistically, increasing salience of mortality increases fear of isolation and thereby improves the rate of altruistic pro-social behavior. This spurs awareness of relevant social cues leading to increased social salience.

In 1969, the track reopened as a 1/2 mile oval where it held races until it closed in 1981 after a fire destroyed the main concession stand and majority of the bleachers. The track closed for a while in 1988 but reopened in 1996 with Roger Crick and Mike Graham as the owners and has seen success. The speedway was purchased by H & H Motorsports in 2010. The new owners closed the auto racing program in July 2011. Kart racing and some special events continued through 2011. Mark Tatalovic brought the track back to life in 2016. Over the years the track has seen names like Jeff Gordon, Kenny Wallace, Steve Kinser, Ken Schrader and Dave Blaney that have graced the clay oval in Venango County. After a short run of the track, it was once again place up for sale. In the fall of 2019, the facility was purchased by Merle Black, of Mercer, PA.

He was a Distinguished Professor of Physics at the City College of New York. Early years Bunji Sakita was born in Japan in 1930 in the Toyama prefecture. He received his bachelor's degree from Kanazawa University in 1953. He then worked with Sakata's group in Nagoya University, obtaining his master's degree in 1956. He was among a select group of Japanese students recruited by Robert Marshak to come for graduate studies to the University of Rochester. In Rochester, Sakita worked with Professor Charles Goebel and received his Ph.D in 1959. He went on to a postdoctoral position and a professorship at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In his beginning years at Wisconsin, and during a year he spent at the Argonne National Laboratory, he developed the SU(6) symmetry of the nonrelativistic quark model generalizing Wigner's supermultiplet symmetry of combining spin and isospin. In 1967, during a visit to Israel, he learned of the dual resonance model, and his later work at Wisconsin was mostly devoted to this idea. With Goebel, he obtained the many-particle generalization of the Veneziano amplitude. In work with Keiji Kikkawa, M. A. Virasoro and others, he addressed the problem of unitarity of the dual amplitudes, setting up the formalism of dual diagrams, analogous to Feynman diagrams, for the computation of loop amplitudes. In work done with C.S. Hsue, M. A. Virasoro and notably with Jean-Loup Gervais, Sakita developed the functional formalism for these calculations in which summation over Riemann surfaces naturally emerged. Supersymmetry In 1971, Jean-Loup Gervais and Bunji Sakita, in a paper titled \\"Field Theory Interpretation of Supergauges in Dual Models\\", showed the boson–fermion symmetry of the fermionic string theory, writing down the first linear supersymmetric action. In modern parlance the Gervais–Sakita Lagrangian has a local superconformal symmetry. The 1973 work of Wess and Zumino extended the two-dimensional supersymmetry discovered in string theory to four-dimensional field theories with spacetime supersymmetry. (Different versions of supersymmetry had been discovered by two Soviet physicists, Yu. A. Gol'fand and E.P. Likhtman a little earlier; this was not known to physicists elsewhere at that time.) In 1970, Robert Marshak became president of the City College of New York. Sakita moved there as Distinguished Professor to participate in the rapid expansion of the physics program and to lead the High Energy Group. A strong group was built up with first rate work on many areas such as string theory, supersymmetry, particle phenomenology and others. Sakita and CCNY Sakita was an exceptional mentor with an intense working relationship with many of his students whom he treated as his equals. Many of the CCNY students and research associates of this time have gone onto distinguished careers of their own. In recognition of his many contributions, he was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1970 and was awarded the Nishina Memorial Prize of Japan in 1974.  Death  He died on August 31, 2002 in Japan after a year- long battle with cancer. He is survived by his children Mariko Sakita, Mark Mozeson and Taro Sakita, and his grandchildren Evan, Sarah, and Kayla Mozeson.

Depending on the exact year of the show, Hyacinth is born between 1930 (to be 19 on the first day of 1950) and 1940 (to be 19 in exactly 1959.) The Walton name was also introduced in Young Hyacinth, as it is never mentioned in the series. who insists that her surname is pronounced \\"Bouquet\\", as in an arrangement of flowers. Hyacinth's primary aims in life are to impress people, particularly of the upper and upper-middle classes, and to give the impression that she is of high social standing, despite her fairly average status. Hyacinth and Richard live at number 22 Blossom Avenue, in a bungalow which Hyacinth refers to as \\"The Residence\\" when sending letters. She describes herself as a \\"local celebrity\\", and believes she is held in high and enviable esteem by the community for her candlelight suppers, charity work and her involvement in the local amateur dramatics. In an attempt to make callers think she is well-off enough to employ domestic staff, she repeatedly (and famously) answers her beloved pearl-white slimline telephone with automatic redial facility with, \\"The Bouquet residence; the lady of the house speaking.\\" While on the phone, she is prone to making impossible requests of people and does not understand why they cannot be met. Such situations include demanding a shipping forecast for a river, complaining how she suspects her water is \\"second hand\\", or calling the rubbish collectors and forbidding them from driving down her neighbourhood on days they do not collect rubbish as she believes it gives the impression she produces excessive rubbish. Those around her despise her snobbery, her constant meddling, her outlandish plans and her refusal to listen to others. Hyacinth seems completely oblivious of everyone's terror of her and wants to believe the best of most people, that they are either enamoured with her and too shy to say so or that they are trying to be considerate of her by not bothering her. However, she cannot abide anyone one- upping her when it comes to social events or showing the same snobbery she herself shows. She has a penchant for finding the most disagreeable people to try to impress, while at the same time shunning agreeable people who are of lower social standing, but never seems to learn from her mistakes. Hyacinth goes to great lengths to avoid her poorer or oddly-behaving relatives (Daisy, Onslow, Rose, Bruce and, to an extent, Daddy) in public, while boasting about her richer sister (Violet, who has \\"a Mercedes, sauna, and room for a pony\\") in order to maintain her vaunted social status. However, she loves her family, especially her father, and will rush to their aid in times of need. She rarely acknowledges the fact, however, that her family treat her more kindly than most characters on the series whom she is trying to impress, being equally willing to come to her aid in an emergency as she is for them. Another of Hyacinth's other quirks is that she frequently refers to or makes preparations for her candlelight suppers, attendance at which almost seems mandatory, but we never actually see one in progress. She also plans other extravagant functions such as fancy picnics and barbecues, which usually end in disaster. She is an excellent housekeeper, keeping the house immaculately clean and setting absolutely beautiful tables for dinners and functions. She is very proud of her various china dishes and objets d'art, especially her Royal Doulton tea service with the hand-painted periwinkles. She can play the piano, and often attempts to sing for (or at) people. While she has a rich, strong voice, she tends to force it too hard and loudly, making her singing unpleasant to listen to. She often plots and schemes to make herself or Richard look higher-class than they are, and has a tendency to embellish upon stories of her and Richard's exploits to make them sound better than they really were, to impress other people. She does the same with stories of her son, Sheridan, whom she adores even though he only wants her money. She also has a great aversion to dogs and indeed most animals, which is reciprocated by the animals themselves. As revealed in the special \\"Young Hyacinth\\", Hyacinth is the eldest of the four floral-named Walton sisters: in birth order, Hyacinth, Daisy, Violet and Rose. =Richard Bucket= Played by Clive Swift, Richard Bucket is Hyacinth's long-suffering husband who is at her beck and call. Richard is a calm, tolerant and relaxed character who cares little for enhancing or preserving social status, and he seems content with his (barely) middle class standing. He is usually laid back but has two great fears; heights, and Hyacinth spending too much money on things. He pronounces his last name, Bucket, as the English word, and snaps to Hyacinth in one episode: \\"It's not 'Bouquet', it's Bucket! It was always Bucket until I met you.\\" Richard Bucket married Hyacinth Walton (as she was back then) on 9 February 1963 and moved into 22 Blossom Avenue at a later date. Although the house is in his name, he does not have a key for it: Hyacinth has the only key. Until series three, he works as a public servant, a deputy in the Town Council's Department of Finance and General Purposes. He dreads the idea of retirement, as it would mean being with Hyacinth all day, every day for the rest of his life, but is forced into early retirement despite begging and pleading with his boss. After his early retirement, Hyacinth attempts to get Richard back into the workforce in a \\"senior executive position\\" in several jobs, but the attempts never succeed. In \\"The Senior Citizens' Outing\\", he is seen reading a self-help book titled, Can You Afford to Retire?, suggesting he too is still eager to get back into the workforce, though this is more likely as a means of escaping Hyacinth than any real monetary concern. A few times, Richard has stood up to Hyacinth in public because of her unreasonable behaviour, driving her into shock, but he is usually meek and mild in front of other people. He is not afraid to disagree with Hyacinth in private, however, and does so frequently, though she never listens and he always winds up capitulating to her whims. These usually involve contrived plots to impress neighbours or aristocrats, or a far-fetched plan to avoid Hyacinth's down-market family, whom he actually prefers to the upper-class people Hyacinth is determined to mingle with. Whenever anyone asks how he manages to cope with Hyacinth, he often compares his marriage to being in the army: every day is routinely planned out for him, and he never has to make any decisions. He also points out that Hyacinth is extremely kind and caters to his every need. However, in \\"Please Mind Your Head\\", it is revealed that they are no longer intimate, as Hyacinth disapproves of it at their age, and in other episodes Richard indicates that Hyacinth lost interest in him once their son Sheridan was born. Richard and Hyacinth own a blue 1986 Rover 216, which Richard is often forced to polish, sometimes multiple times a day. He drives the car because Hyacinth has not learned to drive, but claims he only steers while Hyacinth drives by \\"word of mouth\\". A running gag of the series is that, besides directing every turn he makes, Hyacinth incessantly tells him to watch out for various people, animals, or objects that are on the side of the road or on the pavement, as if they might suddenly leap out and block Richard's path. An exasperated Richard usually responds with \\"Minding the... whatever it is!\\", in a silly voice, which irritates Hyacinth. Richard is an avid reader, and is often shown with a book in hand – he mentions to the vicar in \\"Let There Be Light\\" that he uses reading as an escape from Hyacinth, often reading in the bathroom to avoid interruption. However, while Richard protests otherwise, Hyacinth insists Richard's favourite hobby is gardening, and forces him to work in the garden and look happy while doing so, hoping neighbours will think they could afford a gardener but don't have one because Richard likes doing it himself. Hyacinth twice tries to get him started in golf, also to impress wealthy people, but Richard is no good at it. In \\"Richard's New Hobby\\", Hyacinth also tried to get him started in amateur cinematography, but an unfortunate mishap involving the police put that to an end quickly. As shown in several episodes, Richard sings, and is actually a bit better at it than Hyacinth is, but he usually does not make a habit of singing unless asked to by someone else. In \\"The Father Christmas Suit\\", it was revealed he also knows how to play piano (Richard plays while he and Emmet drunkenly sing \\"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\\"). In \\"How to Go on Holiday Without Really Trying\\", Richard is shown to be excellent at billiards, when Onslow \\"kidnaps\\" him and takes him to a local pub. Roy Clarke, writer of the show, described Richard as a foil to show Hyacinth's character to worst advantage. Although various characters in the series often express bemusement as to Richard's tolerance for Hyacinth, the cast and crew observe that he simply loves her and that his sense of humour helps get him through. =Daisy= Daisy (played by Judy Cornwell) is the second-born of the Walton sisters. A happy, lively character, Daisy lives with her slobbish husband Onslow, her man-crazy sister Rose and their senile father. Her married surname is never given. Daisy, Onslow and Rose are the lower-class relatives Hyacinth is ashamed of. It is repeatedly mentioned that Daisy and Onslow were once very wild and passionate lovers, but Onslow has considerably cooled down with age. Daisy is constantly trying to get her husband to show passion towards her; however, she often fails to rouse any signs of affection from him save the odd compliment, and, as a result, buries herself in Mills & Boon novels. Her other attempts to get Onslow's attention include giving herself a makeover to attract the attention of other men, and getting herself a seventeen-year-old, motorbike-riding toy boy; however, Onslow was sensible enough to not fall for either of these. Much to Onslow's disbelief, Daisy repeatedly insists he is a \\"menace to the female sex\\" and is terrified of the thought of him possibly having another woman, or of other women (even Hyacinth) coming after him. In \\"A Celebrity for the Barbecue\\", she even likens him to Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire. It is sometimes hinted that these claims are just attempts to rouse Onslow, however. Daisy, like her husband, enjoys life in the slow lane; she spends most of her time sitting on the sofa eating, reading romance novels borrowed from the public library, or watching television. Daisy is full of life and always smiling, despite picking up her husband's bad habits of sleeping until noon, eating junk food, drinking beer and watching television all day. She and Onslow are actually fairly well-educated, and often have philosophical discussions, but these never last long because she usually tries to turn the conversation to love fairly quickly. Daisy tries to rein in Rose's dramatics, but her own flighty nature often gets in the way of these endeavours. She also has trouble keeping an eye on Daddy, and frequently has to ask Hyacinth for help when he goes off on one of his exploits, or does something outlandish at home. She makes half-hearted efforts to look nice around Hyacinth and tries to get Onslow to do the same, but usually fails. She also tries to rescue the Vicar and Emmett from Rose when she can. Daisy and Onslow have a daughter called Stephanie, who appears only in the final episode of series one, along with her own daughter Kylie and two lovers. In \\"Let There Be Light\\", Daisy reveals she was once a Liverpool supporter, but changed loyalties because of Onslow's intense hatred for the team. A kindly soul at heart, Daisy does try to help Hyacinth when the latter reluctantly has to ask for help on occasion, but is rarely ever acknowledged or thanked. Like Onslow, although Hyacinth is ashamed of her, she gets along well with every other character she meets during the series thanks to her cheerful nature. =Onslow= Onslow's surname is never given. He is played by Geoffrey Hughes, is Hyacinth's brother-in-law, and is a tattooed, beer-guzzling, unemployed and apathetic slob intensely despised by Hyacinth. Onslow threatens his sister-in-law's social prestige with his scruffy clothes and common, coarse ways. Onslow is proudly \\"workshy, bone idle and out of condition\\", and rarely gets up before lunch or dinner time. In multiple episodes, it is implied he was a bit wild in his youth, and it is suggested he may even have served time in prison,Onslow references being reminded of \\"hard labour\\" in the episode Problems with Relatives but he has considerably mellowed with age and is a gentle soul under his rough exterior. He watches television all day every day, eating and drinking constantly and rarely moving from his armchair save to go to the bookie's on occasion. He calls himself \\"the breadwinner\\", but his only income comes from betting on horses and Social Security. Nevertheless, Onslow's intellectual reading, and viewing of Open University programmes, have made him knowledgeable on a wide variety of subjects. He is also a fan of an unnamed football club, though he is known to dislike Liverpool – so much so that he felt ready to divorce Daisy when she revealed on their honeymoon that she supported Liverpool. Very occasionally, he goes to the local pub to play billiards or darts, once challenging Richard to play billiards and discovering Richard was actually better at it than he was. He also loves to eat, his favourite snack being Smoky Bacon Crisps. He owns both a bicycle and a 1978 Ford Cortina, which is falling apart and tends to back-fire and belch dark clouds of exhaust. Onslow owns a mixed-breed dog, which lives outside in the rusting carcass of a Hillman Avenger in the front garden. However, he indicates that this is the dog's preference and not neglect on his part, and in several episodes it is shown he does care deeply for the dog and treats her well. He is an inattentive husband to Daisy, in that he never takes her out, nor has he ever bought her any jewellery or clothing. However, he does compliment her on occasion, and the two seem fond of each other despite their issues. His sex drive has slackened off considerably since his youth, and Daisy's frequent efforts to arouse him are often in vain. Despite Hyacinth's utter contempt of him and her belief that he cannot succeed at anything, in the Christmas special \\"Sea Fever\\", Onslow managed to win a newspaper competition, which earned him and Daisy a first-class vacation on the QE2. Hyacinth and Richard were also on board in a cheaper cabin at the time, and, while at first intensely jealous, Hyacinth swallowed her pride and kindly wished Onslow congratulations and danced with him in the ship's ballroom. Also, despite Hyacinth's usual mistreatment of him, Onslow is willing to help Hyacinth when she needs help (though often she would rather it was someone else than him) and even rescued her three-piece suite in the episode of the same name when the van carrying it crashed. He also admitted in \\"Riverside Picnic\\" that he admired Hyacinth's stiff upper lip when things went wrong. Despite Hyacinth's disdain for him, Onslow is shown to get on well with almost everyone, including his own vicar, Hyacinth's vicar, Emmett, Elizabeth, Bruce and Violet. He is exasperated by Rose and Daddy on occasion, and thinks Daisy should not take their dramatics so seriously. Onslow is also good friends with Richard, nicknaming him \\"Dickie\\" much to Hyacinth's outrage (though Richard himself does not mind), and often tries to persuade him not to let Hyacinth browbeat him all the time. Onslow is – when he can overcome his inherent sloth – an inherently kind and good natured character. He is Roy Clarke's favourite character in the show, as stated in the Comedy Connections series. =Stephanie and Kylie= Stephanie (played by Laura Shavin) is Daisy and Onslow's daughter and Hyacinth's niece. Her daughter, Daisy's and Onslow's granddaughter, is named Kylie and is christened in the episode \\"The Christening\\". Great-Aunt Hyacinth does not approve of the name Kylie, saying it sounds like a foreign vegetable. She also disapproves of the fact that Stephanie had her baby out of wedlock, as do others, though she is the only one to make a point of her disapproval. However, when Stephanie and Kylie don't show up to the christening, Hyacinth and Richard volunteer to search for them and find that Stephanie's caravan is broken down. They also are horrified to discover that she has become a hippie and lives in the caravan with two men, and has no idea which of the two men is Kylie's father. Even the men themselves don't know, and after delivering the trio to the church for the christening, Hyacinth insists she and Richard hide behind a column in the church because she is so ashamed. Stephanie and Kylie are not seen again in the show, although in \\"Problems with Relatives\\", while pushing Daddy in a wheelchair, Daisy says it reminds her of when she and Onslow used to push baby Stephanie in the pram. It also reminds them of why they had to bring the wedding forward, implying Daisy became pregnant out of wedlock as well. = Rose = Hyacinth's youngest, lustful sister, Rose has an eye for men and a taste for short skirts and flashy, provocative outfits. In the episode \\"Early Retirement\\", she reveals she was once married, though it is not stated whether she is widowed or divorced. Her surname is also never given, though her maiden name is Walton like all the other sisters. She was played by Shirley Stelfox in series one and Mary Millar (whose performance was more over-the-top than Stelfox's) in every episode after that. She is another family member who threatens Hyacinth's social prestige, especially as the Vicar and Emmett are two of the men she sometimes chases. She even sometimes cosies up to Richard, though Hyacinth always puts a quick stop to that. Rose is promiscuous, unstable, and prone to fits of hysteria and depression, some of which are genuine but most of which are merely attention-seeking tactics. However, Richard describes her as a gentle soul who is just a bit 'mixed up'. She is constantly having affairs with men, but her choice in men is poor and she often finds herself with married or otherwise unsuitable men who abandon her after a brief fling. Onslow has said more than once that her hormones never get a chance to settle, which explains her outrageous behaviour. She has a penchant for stealing Onslow's cigarettes, and for going into long tirades about men and their unfaithfulness. She regularly becomes 'disillusioned' and decides to 'give up men', sometimes several times in a week, but always has a new beau in record time. She is shown to be relatively uneducated, never reads, often speaks childishly, and cannot spell simple words. Hyacinth is particularly ashamed of Rose, and at times goes to great lengths to keep her existence and their relationship a secret. But she does care for her, all the same. In the episode \\"Charity Shop\\", she stands and listens patiently as Rose confides to her about her dysfunctional love life. Hyacinth cheers her up and then kisses her on the cheek before sending her home. In \\"Iron Age Remains\\", when Rose has locked herself in a room in one of her depressive fits, Hyacinth panics that Rose may have harmed herself, especially when there is no answer at the door (in fact, Rose just had stereo headphones on and couldn't hear the people outside). She sends Richard up a ladder to investigate, but he falls off. Hyacinth also tries to stop a fight between Rose and one of her lovers in \\"A Picnic for Daddy\\", thinking he is a reputable member of society, though she changes her mind and tells the man to stop bothering Rose when she realises she had mistaken his identity and that he was indeed another of Rose's bad choices in men. = Violet and Bruce = Violet (played by Anna Dawson) is the third-eldest of the Walton sisters, who married a successful but eccentric turf accountant named Bruce (played by John Evitts). A sign outside their house reads \\"The Paddocks\\", but it is not revealed if this refers to their surname or is the name of their property. Violet and Bruce were initially unseen characters, apart from the occasional glimpse from a distance, but in the fifth series, both Bruce and Violet became regulars on the show. Bruce and Violet are extremely wealthy. Hyacinth often brags that Violet and Bruce have a large house, Mercedes, sauna, jacuzzi, swimming pool, musical bidet, and room for a pony. They also have a cottage in the countryside, and a villa in Ibiza. However, Violet has a troubled marriage with her eccentric, cross- dressing husband, and repeatedly phones Hyacinth to complain about Bruce's mad behaviour. Bruce often confiscates Violet's clothes in order to wear them himself, leaving her with his clothes. He also has had an affair with his secretary, and has done other unsuitable things such as refusing to come down out of a tree, drinking to excess, wearing strange costumes, throwing childish tantrums over trivial things, and buying lots of nude artwork. In \\"The Toy Store\\", Richard remarks that Bruce is supposed to be on some sort of medication but it's implied he often does not take it. However, despite everything, Hyacinth insists that Violet put up with Bruce for the luxurious lifestyle his wealth gives her, particularly the Mercedes. While Violet is obviously far more affluent than Hyacinth, she is not the snob Hyacinth is. She is far more accepting of Daisy, Onslow and Rose than Hyacinth, in that she is not embarrassed by them. In \\"Riverside Picnic\\", when told by Hyacinth to find a friend \\"in the same income bracket\\" to drive her, Violet calls Onslow and invites her father and sisters to gate-crash Hyacinth's \\"waterside supper with riparian entertainments\\". Although continually bragging about Violet to her friends, Hyacinth cannot use Violet and Bruce to her full advantage, as she often cannot introduce them to friends and neighbours due to their volatile marriage and Bruce's costumes. On the odd occasion, Hyacinth has invited Violet to her candlelight suppers (which Violet does not enjoy any more than anyone else), and it is implied the main reason Hyacinth invites Violet and Bruce around is because she likes to have their Mercedes in her driveway. In the episode \\"A Barbecue at Violet's\\", when Hyacinth and Richard arrive at Violet's home, they arrive in the middle of a vicious domestic row, in which Violet and Bruce are arguing loudly and hurling objects at each other. By \\"Skis\\", Violet eventually wants to divorce Bruce, but Hyacinth frog- marches her distraught sister to the vicar to try to change her mind, determined not to lose her one genuine connection to a higher class. Richard is shown to not be fond of Violet, remarking how she is \\"always moaning\\", nor is he fond of Bruce and his eccentricities. = Daddy = Daddy (played by George Webb) is the apparently senile, divorced father of Hyacinth, Daisy, Rose and Violet; the prequel Young Hyacinth reveals his wife ran off with an American. He lives with Onslow, Daisy and Rose. Hyacinth repeatedly makes bizarre excuses as to why he can't live with her (one being that he brings Sheridan out in a rash), and Daisy herself remarks in \\"Angel Gabriel Blue\\" that to punish Daddy by making him live with Hyacinth would be inhumane. Hyacinth loves her father dearly; however, his antics and constant requirement for attention put her social standing at risk. She tends to make up outlandish stories to explain his behavior to other people. It is often said by Richard that the rundown neighbourhood that Daddy lives in is the one he has lived in all his life, therefore revealing that Hyacinth grew up in the grubby, decrepit area she loathes visiting. While mentally senile, Daddy is still quite capable physically, and seems unable to keep himself out of trouble. He is fit enough to climb onto roofs, ride a skateboard, steal cars, dig trenches, ride bicycles, and wander all over the countryside – all of which he has done, usually causing some embarrassment to his family in the process. Rose apparently inherited her promiscuous streak from him, as he is constantly ogling, pursuing, and accosting women, sometimes promising to marry them. He also relives experiences from his younger days, such as his childhood and his service in the war, and in those moments he will assume the character of his younger self in the clothes he wears and the actions he takes. He often goes missing, and requires the rescue efforts of his daughters and sons-in-law. He has a medication which makes him very drowsy (and therefore manageable) when given, but whenever it wears off, he starts causing trouble again. Daddy's screen appearances are somewhat rare, and his spoken lines even more so. Although his given name is unknown, his surname is revealed to be Walton in Young Hyacinth. = Sheridan Bucket = An unseen character, Sheridan is Hyacinth's and Richard's spoiled and selfish only son, about 18 years of age. He is away at college (a poly which Hyacinth insists is of a \\"university standard\\" – the first three series were written before the Further and Higher Education Act 1992) and is known to audiences primarily through Hyacinth's telephone conversations with him. The major running gag surrounding Sheridan involves him ringing home whenever he needs money, Hyacinth without fail assuming at first that he is \\"just ringing his mummy\\" – despite his age, she still refers to herself and Richard as \\"mummy and daddy\\". Most of the time, he needs money for ludicrous things that his friend Tarquin has suggested, up to and including a walking holiday in Iceland (in 1991, before Iceland became a typical or affordable tourist destination). Although Sheridan usually convinces Hyacinth of his need for the money (much to Richard's exasperation), Hyacinth is very occasionally able to say no. Hyacinth claims Sheridan writes to her constantly, and often expects to receive letters from him, but Sheridan rarely gets in touch unless he wants money. Only once in the series did Sheridan do something for his parents; in the episode \\"What to Wear When Yachting\\", he arranged a weekend for Hyacinth and Richard on a small boat owned by Tarquin's father, which he claimed was a yacht but was in fact a rundown old tug. Sheridan prefers not to talk to Richard on the phone, and has been known to pretend to be someone else whenever he calls and Richard answers. The other running gag is that Richard suspects Sheridan is gay, something which is implied through his love of needlework, his lilac-colored car, his desire for pure silk pyjamas, his male friend, Tarquin (with whom Sheridan makes his own curtains), and his stated lack of interest in girls. Richard regularly tries to raise the issue with Hyacinth, only for her to remain totally oblivious. A glimpse of the back of Sheridan's head can be seen in the episode \\"Let There Be Light\\" while he is in a taxi, and during the opening credits, a photograph of him as a young boy is seen on Hyacinth's writing desk; this is the closest he has ever been seen on the show. Neighbours = Elizabeth 'Liz' Warden = Elizabeth Warden (née Hawksworth) is Hyacinth's friendly, tolerant next-door neighbour who lives at number 24 Blossom Avenue. She has a brother, Emmett, who moves in with her in Series 2. She is played by Josephine Tewson. Hyacinth calls her Elizabeth, but everyone else calls her Liz. Hyacinth often invites her round for coffee, and despite frequent encouragement from her brother, Liz is too weak-willed to say no despite living in fear of Hyacinth's invitations. Aware of Hyacinth's house-proud ways, Elizabeth is terrified of spilling, dropping or breaking anything in her neighbour's home, but ironically, Hyacinth's flighty mannerisms and nagging make Liz especially clumsy in her presence, and she indeed ends up spilling, dropping or breaking something nearly every time. Unlike most, Liz sympathises with Hyacinth, aware of how she is despised by everyone, including Liz's brother Emmet. She is likely Hyacinth's only real friend (although she makes a point of referring to Hyacinth as a \\"neighbour\\" rather than a friend). This friendship is tested by Hyacinth's tactless and unthinking remarks, which usually involve Elizabeth's dexterity, clothes, car, appearance, and her daughter's intelligence. Liz likes Richard quite dearly, and has deep sympathy for him; the two seem discreetly fond of each other. Liz feels pity for Hyacinth's and Richard's son, Sheridan, as well, believing \\"he never really stood a chance\\" with Hyacinth for a mother. Liz is also unsure whether to be amused by or disapproving of her brother's frequent attempts to avoid and/or exact revenge on Hyacinth. Liz's husband Mr Warden is never seen: he is always away due to his work (he is variously mentioned as being in the Far East or in Saudi Arabia). In \\"Onslow's Birthday\\", it is implied that Liz and her husband were having marriage troubles, which is what prompted him to take the position abroad. They have a daughter, Gail, who is also never seen but mentioned in conversation in a few early episodes. Gail grew up friends with Sheridan, but unlike Sheridan she goes to a proper university and is trying to make something of herself. Hyacinth seems a bit jealous of Gail's success as compared to her son's, and sometimes finds reasons to put her down (such as having a live-in boyfriend) when she is mentioned. While Elizabeth did eventually meet and become friends with Rose, Onslow, and Daisy in \\"Problems with Relatives\\", Hyacinth did her best to prevent this happening and afterwards would still go to great lengths to prevent her from seeing their shabby house. Both parties have offered lifts for the other when one is stranded on the side of the road, and have met on other occasions as well. Onslow even jokingly kissed Liz under the mistletoe in the episode \\"The Father Christmas Suit\\", which prompted an inebriated Richard to do the same. Liz owns a white 1988 Austin Metro, which appeared in most episodes and was also subject to tactless comments from Hyacinth about its age and appearance, even though Hyacinth's own car is older. =Emmet Hawksworth= Emmet, played by David Griffin, made his first appearance in \\"A Strange Man\\", and appeared in nearly every subsequent episode. At first, Hyacinth and Richard thought he was Liz's illicit lover, but later found out he was her brother who moved in after he reportedlyEmmett claims to have lost his house in the divorce, but in more than one episode it is stated his wife ran away with another man and was the one at fault, so why he should lose his house is left an unresolved mystery. lost his own house in a messy divorce. Emmet is a cultured person, unlike most of Hyacinth's acquaintances. He rides horses, enjoys working in the garden, and has a fondness for sherry (occasionally over-imbibing, which Liz chides him for). He is a classically trained pianist, as well as both producer and director for the local amateur operatic society. He is also shown to have a fair singing voice, himself. Richard suggests that Emmett probably makes a good salary for his talents. Hyacinth, who always wanted to be on the stage, frequently sings at Emmet, and drops broad hints that he should include her in his work, but to no avail. Emmet has a tendency to be somewhat melodramatic (though not to the same extent as Rose), and is terrified of leaving the house because of Hyacinth's terrible singing and even worse manners being enough to \\"ruin his day.\\" He develops a stronger aversion to Hyacinth than just about any other main character does, to the point he burst into tears when told they were going to visit Hyacinth when the latter was out of town in the episode \\"Violet's Country Cottage\\". He also frequently falls or hurts himself trying to run to escape her. In \\"Singing for Emmett\\", Emmet explosively loses his temper at Hyacinth, only to realize Hyacinth is completely oblivious to it. Therefore, in later episodes, he frequently says nasty things about her practically to her face, because this incident taught him she doesn't listen and won't hear him. Emmett also begins to seek out ways to get back at Hyacinth for the misery she causes himself and Elizabeth. In \\"Let There Be Light\\", he and the Vicar's wife contrive to leave Hyacinth outside the church hall during the Bring and Buy sale to meet a wealthy guest (who happens to own two disagreeable dogs, but Hyacinth doesn't know this). In \\"Hyacinth Is Alarmed\\", Emmett makes a point to call Hyacinth and tell her when the house across the street is burgled twice, because he knows Hyacinth will be jealous that the burglars thought there were better pickings at the Barker-Finches than at her own house. Arguably, his most famous revenge against Hyacinth came in \\"Please Mind Your Head\\", when he discovered Hyacinth was dressed in riding gear to impress the neighbors. He forced her to actually ride a horse to prove she could, taking great delight in her horrible attempts to mount and get the horse started, but showing some remorse when the horse threw her and nearly injured her. In the latter years of the programme, Hyacinth can no longer ignore the fact Emmett is desirous to avoid her, but assumes he's shy and possibly has a romantic attraction to her. Upon hearing this, Emmet says, \\"I think I want to die!\\" Emmett is often pursued by Rose as well, because she believes him handsome. Emmett is initially flattered by Rose's attentions, even showing some attraction to her, but eventually comes to fear her as well because of how eagerly she forces herself on him. Like Liz, Emmett deeply sympathizes with Richard. He and Emmett become friends early on, and Emmett is one of the few people who can get Richard to do something for fun without Hyacinth being too upset, such as going to a pub in \\"Hyacinth is Alarmed\\". Emmett also is shown in several episodes to be friendly with Onslow, despite Hyacinth's initial attempts to keep them apart. In the special features of the complete DVD collection of the series, it is revealed that David Griffin was being treated for cancer during much of the series' run. In later series, Emmett is noticeably much thinner and seems to have aged, because of this, though the show explains it as his having gotten \\"prison pallor\\" from hiding indoors from Hyacinth all the time. Religious people =Michael (the vicar)= Michael (played by Jeremy Gittins) is the young and handsome vicar of St. Mark's Church, which Richard and Hyacinth attend. Like most, he is terrified of Hyacinth, and does his best to avoid her, often unsuccessfully. Moreover, he often forgets that Hyacinth prefers her last name to be pronounced \\"bouquet\\" and addresses her as \\"Mrs Bucket\\". When he's discussing Hyacinth with his wife, they refer to her as \\"the Bucket woman\\". He first arrived in the parish in \\"The New Vicar\\", after being a prison chaplain for an unspecified amount of time.In Picnic for Daddy the Vicar's wife says \\"I liked it better when you were chaplain of a prison\\" He is called \\"that dishy vicar\\" by Rose, who often pursues him, much to the anger of his jealous wife, who dislikes the fact that the majority of Michael's congregation are women who make a fuss of him. The vicar being caught in compromising positions (which in context are quite innocent) with Rose or other women is a recurring gag in the series, as is the Vicar damaging whatever he's holding/using whenever Hyacinth's name is mentioned. However, despite his dislike, he feels it his duty to be sympathetic to Hyacinth most of the time, trying to rescue her from the Commodore's amorous advances in \\"The Commodore\\" and agreeing to help her with her kitchen dilemma in \\"Angel Gabriel Blue\\". He also twice stops to offer Hyacinth and Richard lifts when he spots them stranded on the side of the road, and agrees to try to counsel her sister Violet in the episode \\"Skis\\", though Violet is unwilling to go through with it. The vicar likes Onslow and Daisy and is always glad to see them, and more than once has been to their house to help with various issues (such as a ghost in Daddy's bedroom, or Rose being depressed). However, he has made no secret of the fact he dislikes Hyacinth's father, famously standing up to Hyacinth in the episode \\"The Father Christmas Suit\\" to demand she take her inebriated and nearly-nude father away from the church Christmas gathering 'as soon as possible'. Only once did the vicar try to exact revenge on Hyacinth, in the episode \\"Senior Citizen's Outing\\". He saddled her with the two most difficult seniors to deal with, telling his wife he'd 'make up for it on Sunday'. =The vicar's wife= Played by Marion Barron, the vicar's wife is usually referred to as \\"dear\\" by her husband. She is a timid yet fiery young woman with a soft Scottish accent. She often finds her husband in compromising positions with Rose, whom she nicknames 'the vampire sister', or other young females and incorrectly assumes the worst. These situations are usually prefaced in an earlier scene where she expresses jealousy over the attention that Michael's female parishioners give him. She is the first person in the series to refer to Hyacinth by the sobriquet \\"the Bucket woman\\", which quickly spreads to her husband and the rest of the town. The vicar's wife initially dislikes Hyacinth, but as the series goes on, she grows to see more humour in some of Hyacinth's behaviour than other characters do. She has been seen to stifle fits of laughter at Hyacinth's suggestion of leaving sick parishioners outside while the vicar attends a party of Hyacinth's, and on another occasion merrily bobbed her head in time to Hyacinth's horrendous singing. She is also the only person who seems willing (instead of forced) to go on Hyacinth's little expedition in \\"Riverside Picnic\\". Mrs Partridge, like Emmett, has frequently attempted various small revenges against Hyacinth. In \\"How to Go On Holiday Without Really Trying\\", she tricks Hyacinth into cleaning the toilets in the church hall all by herself, and in \\"Let There Be Light\\", she assigned Hyacinth to the booth farthest away from anyone else in the church Bring and Buy sale. Furthermore, in the same episode, she and Emmett contrived to get Hyacinth to stay outside and wait for Mrs Drummond and her disagreeable dogs, instead of helping set up the sale. =The other vicar= The other vicar (played by Gerald Sim) had a single appearance in the episode \\"The Christening\\". He looks older than Michael the vicar, and his church is at a different location from Michael's. He is Onslow's and Daisy's friend and likes to joke around with them. Other townspeople =Michael the postman= Michael the postman was played by Leo Dolan in the first series and by David Janson from 1992 on. He is impertinent, high-strung, and completely overwhelmed by Hyacinth Bucket, of whom he lives in fear. He would rather avoid her, but tries to stand up to her when she pounces on him, which is every time he delivers (and occasionally throws) mail to her house. She constantly makes sure she takes all letters in person, never allowing him to put them in the letterbox itself and sternly rebuking him when he tries to do so. She frequently makes impossible demands of him, such as letting her see Elizabeth's mail, or switching all second class stamps on her letters to first class stamps, or having him track down packages or letters that were never actually sent. He tries many techniques to not speak to Hyacinth, but all fail. In later episodes he develops a bad twitch, and he openly tells Hyacinth it is her fault, but she seems not to notice. He is the father of seven children. =The milkman= Played by Robert Rawles, the unnamed Milkman is in the same position as Michael the Postman, in that he constantly sneaks about doing his level best to avoid speaking to Hyacinth. Like the postman, he always fails, and usually finds himself bombarded with ridiculous requests such as finding out which specific cows the milk comes from and making sure Hyacinth receives exactly the same bottles every time. He and the postman consider themselves fellow brothers in affliction, and celebrate whenever Hyacinth is on holiday. However, unlike the postman, the milkman never loses his cool with Hyacinth and is not afraid of her, merely annoyed by her. = Major Wilton-Smythe = Major Wilton-Smythe (played by Peter Cellier), commonly known simply as \\"the major\\", only appears in the first two series, and hopelessly lusts after Hyacinth even though he is married to a never-seen wife, whom he refers to as \\"the ball and chain\\". He fought in World War II and is a veteran of the British North African Campaign against Erwin Rommel. The Major lives in a large house called The Laurels, which is just around the corner from Hyacinth and Richard's bungalow. In \\"Golfing with the Major\\", he reveals he was wounded in the leg somewhere east of Suez, and he still has \\"some poxy foreign lead in there somewhere\\". He pretends to limp on this injury when he wants to get out of doing something he doesn't like, walking normally whenever people aren't watching. He is brash and forceful, and disliked by Richard. In particular, Richard finds it odd that an elderly man like the major prefers whizzing about in a two-seat sports car convertible rather than driving in presumably a more sensible car – the major drives a Morgan Plus 4. Despite his irritating behaviour, his upper- class status means that Hyacinth refuses to sever contact with the man. At one point she admits \\"it's a good thing he's a Major... if he were a Sergeant, he wouldn't get a foot past the door!\\" =Mrs Councillor Nugent= Mrs Nugent (played by Charmian May) is high up the social ladder but low down the charismatic scale, being a dull, bad-tempered and ill-mannered woman. She speaks in an overly loud and militaristic tone and goes on unnecessary tirades about \\"excessive romantic behaviour\\" and wasting money. Despite her dislike of romance, however, she thinks it would be fun to be a part of the film industry, and dons a skimpy costume when she thinks Richard is filming an amateur movie in \\"Richard's New Hobby\\". She also seems to be the only person who can get away with referring to Hyacinth as \\"Mrs Bucket\\" without Hyacinth correcting her. In \\"The Toy Store\\", when Mrs Nugent yells \\"Mrs Bucket\\", Hyacinth can be seen mouthing out \\"It's Bouquet\\", meaning she still wants to correct her, but stifles it. Hyacinth tolerates her, not only because of her status, but also because she wants a place on her committee. The nature of the committee is never established. Hyacinth admits that she doesn't know what the committee does, she just wants a seat on it. =Sonia Barker-Finch= Sonia Barker-Finch lives in the same street as Hyacinth, just opposite her own home in Number 23, Villa Costa Blanca. Above all her other acquaintances, Hyacinth is convinced that Mrs Barker-Finch is her greatest social rival; however, Mrs Barker-Finch does not seek to outdo Hyacinth in any way, and generally wants nothing to do with her at all. She is referred to in many episodes, but only makes an (uncredited) appearance in the episode \\"Driving Mrs. Fortescue\\", appearing on the pavement with a friend just in time to see Hyacinth embarrassingly trapped on the back of a moving lorry. Although Hyacinth invites Mrs Barker-Finch to parties and dinners, Mrs Barker-Finch usually declines. She also had the temerity to talk while Hyacinth was singing, once, firmly making her an enemy of Hyacinth's. Hyacinth hypocritically believes Mrs Barker-Finch to be a snob (\\"She was a Barker, he was a Finch, now suddenly they're hyphenated\\") and is determined to get one up on her at every opportunity. She also believes Mrs Barker-Finch is inferior to her. In \\"Hyacinth is Alarmed\\", when Hyacinth hears that Mrs Barker-Finch has been burgled twice, rather than sympathise with her, she accuses Mrs Barker-Finch of being \\"pretentious\\", and opines that only a \\"low-class burglar\\" would rob Number 23. Hyacinth furthermore becomes unreasonably jealous whenever Mrs Barker-Finch has some form of social success and becomes adamant that she will do better than her. This was best exampled in the episode \\"A Celebrity for the Barbecue\\", when Mrs. Barker-Finch invited a prominent businessman to her house. Hyacinth went to great lengths to throw a barbecue with a more distinguished celebrity. In \\"Three Piece Suite\\", Hyacinth ordered a three- piece suite that was \\"an exact replica of the one at Sandringham House\\", and went to extraordinary lengths to ensure Mrs Barker-Finch saw it being delivered by \\"The van with the royal warrant on it\\", such as repeatedly phoning her so that she would have to come to the window and see the delivery van pull up. An ill-timed phone call from Sheridan to ask for money fouled the plan up, and Richard had to pay the van to drive away and come back. Unfortunately, the van was seen to crash into a verge shortly thereafter, and Daisy and Onslow's hired lorry turned up just as this happened. This resulted in them delivering the three-piece suite to Hyacinth's house instead, which Mrs. Barker-Finch presumably saw (much to Hyacinth's dismay). =Delia Wheelwright= Delia Wheelright is another unseen rival of Hyacinth. Her apparent rivalry with Hyacinth forms the central plot for the episode 'How To Go On Holiday Without Really Trying'. At the beginning of the episode, Hyacinth is talking to Delia Wheelright on the phone. We do not hear the other side of the conversation, but it is revealed that the former is going on an expensive holiday to the Caribbean. Although she does not express it on the telephone, Hyacinth is greatly put out by this and sets out to better her. Hyacinth drags Richard into town to visit some travel agencies and inquire about holidays, though not the cheap sort of holiday that 'caters to the spaghetti and chips brigade\\". Of course the Buckets cannot afford to pay for any of the expensive holidays, but Hyacinth grabs information regarding trips for the Orient Express and the QE2 (the latter trip being one they actually save up to take in the 1994 Christmas special). On the way home, Hyacinth deliberately drops the brochures out of the car window in front of some friends of Delia Wheelright, in the hope that they will see the brochures and the news gets back to her that Hyacinth is going on an expensive holiday. As usual the plan comes to nothing as the friends in question take no notice. =Lydia Hawksworth= Another of Hyacinth's social rivals, Lydia Hawksworth (actress uncredited) earned Hyacinth's ire during one of her candlelight suppers, when she obnoxiously commented that Hyacinth's kiwifruit were \\"lower middle-class\\", and further rubbed Hyacinth up the wrong way by boasting about her recent holiday in Corfu. This behavior suggests she is either as snobbish as Hyacinth, or possibly just another of the many people exasperated by her and knows better than others how to get Hyacinth's goat. Although not explicitly mentioned, it is also possible that she may be either Emmet's ex- wife or some other relation of Elizabeth and Emmet, given her surname. In the episode, \\"The Rolls Royce\\", Hyacinth was outraged at losing to Lydia in a flower arranging contest, and even further dismayed that Lydia had acquired a flashy new Jaguar. She then began a scheme to show her up, by visiting an exclusive garage and convincing the owner to let her \\"test drive\\" a Rolls Royce. However, Hyacinth badgered Richard into driving the Rolls out to the country club where Mrs Hawksworth often went, and the vehicle was reported as stolen. Hyacinth was apprehended by police officers as soon as Mrs Hawksworth arrived, much to the latter's glee. = Mrs Fortescue = Mrs Fortescue (played by Jean Anderson) is the irascible, bossy and inconsiderate widow of a wealthy businessman who is a parishioner at the Buckets' church. Her sister is married to a baronet, which leads Hyacinth to perform favours for her even if they are inconvenient to her and Richard, with hopes of socializing with members of the nobility. She appeared in \\"Driving Mrs. Fortescue\\". Mrs Fortescue asks for a lift into town – as she has had her own driving license revoked for speeding – and Hyacinth goes to enormous lengths to impress her, even forcing Richard to rehearse how he is going to ring her doorbell. Richard is not fond of Mrs Fortescue because she hits him with her walking stick. Much to Hyacinth's dismay, Mrs Fortescue accidentally meets Rose, Daisy and Onslow, and gets on extremely well with them. =The two Miss Pillsworths= Miss Pillsworth and Miss Pillsworth (played by Lois Penson and Clare Kelly) are two elderly spinster sisters that appear in the series 5 episode 'Skis'. They are from a rather posh and \\"very old\\" family, their late father having been a Colonel. Hyacinth and Richard drive through town, and on the way they pass the two Miss Pillsworths and, despite the lack of space in the car and the fact that both dislike Hyacinth and are reluctant to travel with her, manage to persuade the two women to take a lift. However, Hyacinth insists they detour through the beautiful neighborhood Violet lives in before letting them out of the car, prompting the elder Miss Pillsworth to fear they've been kidnapped. Later on in the same episode, the sisters run away when they see Hyacinth coming, afraid she'll insist on giving them another lift. =The Thorgunbys= Mr Reginald 'Reggie' Thorgunby (played by Mark Brackenbury) was Richard's superior in the Department of Finance and General Purposes. In \\"The Father Christmas Suit\\", it was Hyacinth's intention to have Mr Thorgunby and his wife Fiona (played by Annette Peters) around for mulled wine and hot mince pies so that they could discuss the conditions of Richard's early retirement. Unfortunately for her, a series of mishaps involving a drunken Richard, a disguised Elizabeth, and a semi-naked Daddy caused the Thorgunbys to give up on the idea of a Christmas visit and drive back home. Earlier on in the episode, Hyacinth phoned the Thorgunby's house. She was surprised to have a timid childish voice answer at the other end. Believing it to be a child, Hyacinth told the person to \\"run along, poppet, and tell your Mummy Mrs Thorgunby that there is a nice lady wanting to speak with her\\". However, it turned out that Hyacinth was speaking to Mrs Thorgunby. =The Millburns= Mr. Millburn (Played by Frederick Jaeger) is the owner of Frosticles Frozen Food factory, and a neighbour of Hyacinth and Richard. His unseen wife is a member of the Ladies' Luncheon Committee along with Hyacinth, and Hyacinth dislikes her, calling her a \\"thrusting creature.\\" Hyacinth and Richard tend to refer to the Millburns as Mr. and Mrs. Frosticles instead of their actual names. Their acquaintance is only slight, as Richard forgot who they were for a time, and Millburn had no recollection at all of who Hyacinth and Richard were. He was shown as a not-very-bright man, who valued stupidity as a quality and who enjoyed golfing. In \\"A Job for Richard\\", Millburn announced an open senior executive position at his factory. Hyacinth schemed with Onslow to get Richard the job, roping a reluctant Richard into it. The scheme involved Onslow pretending to be a hoodlum and Richard pretending to subdue him, to impress Millburn. The arrival of two real hoodlums (which Hyacinth had to chase off herself) messed up the plan, and Millburn offered the job to Hyacinth instead, though she refused. =The Cooper-Bassets= The Cooper- Bassets (Mr. Cooper-Basset was played by Derek Waring, Mrs. Cooper-Basset was uncredited) were a wealthy married couple, who liked amusement parks, having met on a ghost train. They appeared in \\"Senior Citizen's Outing.\\" Hyacinth, Richard, and Elizabeth ran into them while escorting some senior citizens on an outing to the seaside. Hyacinth initially wanted to meet up with them, but they went out of their way to avoid her. However, the tables were turned when the Cooper-Bassets showed up a second time while Hyacinth was dealing with an embarrassing situation with one of the senior citizens, and she tried to avoid them, but without success. =Signor Farrini and Mrs. Lomax= Appearing only in \\"Senior Citizen's Outing\\", Signor Farrini (played by Angus Lennie) and Mrs. Lomax (played by Rita Davies) were the two senior citizens Hyacinth was to escort to the outing at the beach. The vicar, knowing full well they were the two most difficult to manage of the group, deliberately saddled Hyacinth with them and told his wife that he knew it was wicked and that he would 'make up for it on Sunday'. Signor Farrini was a senile, elderly Italian gentleman, who was almost instantly enamored with Hyacinth. He did everything in his power to follow her around and express his love, even going so far as to handcuff himself and Hyacinth together when she wasn't looking. Mrs. Lomax was an even older lady, who suffered from severe motion sickness, to the point she would even begin to feel sick in anticipation of getting in the car and would require stops every few miles to prevent her from vomiting. She also had a gluttonous appetite for sweets and ice cream. =Mrs. Drummond= Mrs. Drummond (played by Sue Lloyd) appeared in \\"Let There Be Light\\" and was a wealthy and very inconsiderate parishioner of Michael the vicar, and another person Hyacinth tried to impress. Her family lived on an estate called \\"The Grange\\", and Hyacinth always introduced them as \\"The Drummonds. From the Grange, you know.\\" She had two ill-behaved Labrador retrievers who despised Hyacinth, but Hyacinth pretended not to notice, since Mrs. Drummond had said she had no time for anyone who disliked dogs. Mrs. Drummond would watch while other people worked, and was very much so a snob. =Bunty and Dorian= Bunty and Dorian (played by Marcia Warren and Royce Mills) were two extremely eccentric neighbours of Bruce and Violet, who appeared in \\"Violet's Country Cottage\\". They lived in a manor house next door to the aforementioned cottage, but whether they actually were aristocracy or not was not mentioned (it was, however, strongly hinted, in that Hyacinth was keen to ingratiate herself with \\"the lady from the manor house\\" and in that she recalled Violet's description of her as \\"eccentric but very well-connected\\"). They tended to dress in shabby country wear and behaved very oddly, as befits friends of the equally eccentric Bruce, whom Bunty referred to as \\"The Weirdo\\". Bunty enjoyed drinking, hunting and shooting. She first met Hyacinth while looking for her lost dog (Hyacinth and Richard were staying in the cottage at the time). Unlike many of the people Hyacinth seeks to impress, Bunty didn't seem to find anything amiss in Hyacinth's genteel manner. Richard met up with her husband Dorian while helping to look for the missing dog at Hyacinth's behest, and brought Dorian back to the cottage with him. Bunty quickly became drunk and Dorian started to pursue Hyacinth amorously, which amused Bunty to no end. For once, Hyacinth did not act snobbishly but went with the flow, and the three of them danced a conga line at the end of the episode. =Zoe Zbygn (Mrs. Thing)= Zoe Zbygn made an uncredited appearance in the episode \\"Violet's Country Cottage\\". She was an elderly lady from Poland who spoke very little English. While all the other characters could spell her surname, no one could figure out how to pronounce it. Daisy finally settled on \\"Mrs. Thing\\", which the other characters (even Hyacinth) also called her. She was Daddy's girlfriend for a time, and accompanied Daddy, Daisy, Onslow, and Rose to the cottage to visit Hyacinth. She seemed a mostly deadpan individual until she heard Richard calling her name, which made her excitedly leave Daddy's side and act amorously toward Richard. In actuality, Richard was calling Bunty's lost dog, who was also named Zoe. =The Commodore= The Commodore (played by Nigel Davenport) appeared in the episode \\"The Commodore\\" and was an old seafaring man who became famous sailing round Cape Horn singlehandedly. He retired from the sea and made a living going around as a guest speaker at events. Hyacinth went to great lengths to meet and impress him, and volunteered the Vicar to give him a ride back to the train station after the Commodore had given a speech. The Commodore had a notorious reputation with the ladies, including a scandalous divorce. Hyacinth ignored warnings about him, enamored with the prospect of meeting a Commodore, until he tried to seduce her in the back seat of the Vicar's car. The Vicar tried to rescue the terrified Hyacinth by offering to let her out of the car, but because stopping would mean the Commodore would miss his train (and be stuck with her!) Hyacinth told him to keep driving. =His Lordship= Never named, and played by Bruce Montague, His Lordship was a suave and wealthy peer who lived on a large estate some miles out in the country from Hyacinth's house. He was said to be the son of the deceased Dowager Lady Ursula. He was one of the kindliest, most considerate characters in the series. In \\"Country House Sale\\", Hyacinth first met His Lordship in the large drive of his mansion, at the estate sale of his late mother. Hyacinth, unaware to whom she was speaking, asked him for directions, which he happily gave her. Later, she overheard a servant address him as 'Milord' and realized who she was talking to. After the estate sale had concluded, Hyacinth, who had bought several bottles of homemade wine in the sale, sought out his Lordship, and the two seemed to get along well together. They shared a toast to the late Dowager Lady Ursula, but the wine was too strong for Hyacinth, who promptly became hopelessly drunk. However, His Lordship was very nice about the whole business, blaming the wine and not Hyacinth and helping Richard get his confused wife safely back to the car. =Sir Edward= In the episode \\"Looking at Properties\\", Hyacinth and Richard briefly leased a second home in the form of a flat in the roof of a large manor house, and were neighbours to Sir Edward (played by John Arnatt). He lived on the ground floor, and spent most of his time snoozing in a wheelchair with his gouty foot propped up. He took an instant dislike to Hyacinth when the first thing she did was inadvertently bump into his gouty foot, and barely spoke to her after that incident. =Mrs. Braddock= Seen only in \\"Country Estate Sale\\", Mrs. Braddock (played by Jessica James) is a senile older woman who attends Senior Lunches with Daddy and who stalks his house and insists he proposed to her, though Daddy remembers only offering her a \\"temporary arrangement\\". Rose and Daisy imply she's stalked their house before, but only one instance is shown, in which she shoos Onslow's dog away from the old car she naps in, and takes her place, waiting outside to nab Daddy. She causes Onslow to fall into the hedge (parodying a recurring gag of Hyacinth doing the same whenever the dog barks) by jumping out and yelling \\"Oi!\\" at him. She also scares Hyacinth into the hedge when she arrives later in the episode. =Mr. Mawsby= Mr. Mawsby (played by Preston Lockwood) appeared in \\"Angel Gabriel Blue\\". Daddy went off on one of his adventures and rented the room to the equally elderly Mr. Mawsby, giving him a receipt. Mr. Mawsby stayed in the room for a time, and Rose and Daisy mistook Mr. Mawsby for Daddy and brought him meals. When Rose found out he wasn't Daddy, Mr. Mawsby locked himself in the room and refused to leave. Eventually, after the entire family tried various tactics to get him out, Hyacinth sent Richard up a ladder to try to contact him through the window. However, Daddy came back and Mr. Mawsby left of his own volition, referring to his rented accommodation as a 'Madhouse'. =Rose's boyfriends= Throughout the series, Rose has a long succession of boyfriends, sometimes seeing more than one at the same time. It is a running gag that Rose has a new one almost every episode. Most are unseen, but a few make appearances, usually embarrassing Hyacinth in some way in the process. Reg and Dennis Appeared in \\"The Christening\\", played by Bruce Bennett and Jonathan Fryer. Rose spent the first half of the episode on the phone alternately with the two men, playing them off each other and trying to make one of them jealous enough of the other to escort her to her grand-niece's christening. Unfortunately, this backfired as both men arrived at the church at the same time and began squabbling over Rose in front of all the guests. Charlie Charlie (played by John Darrell) was a local police inspector who appeared in the episode \\"Senior Citizen's Outing\\". It was implied he'd had a brief fling with Rose in the past; however, when he met her again, he was less than thrilled to renew the acquaintance, given she called him out in front of his peers at the police station. Mr. Sudbury Mr. Sudbury (played by Tony Kemp) was a tall, elegant man that Rose fell for because of his dancing skills. He appeared briefly in \\"The Father Christmas Suit\\", literally dancing down the street with her. Boris and Mr. Heliwell Boris and Mr. Heliwell, (played by Dicken Ashworth and Gregory Cox), were both mentioned in several episodes as on-again-off-again flames of Rose's, but only appeared in \\"The Candlelight Supper\\". They were two very large and loud men who embarrassingly fought over Rose's affections on Hyacinth's front doorstep, only getting louder when Rose told them to go away because she had fallen for Emmett. The disturbance prompted Hyacinth – who had Elizabeth and Emmett over for dinner – to sing as loud as she could to drown the fighting out. The horrible, off-key racket actually stopped the fight and made both men flee, which was not Hyacinth's intent but it did save the situation. Roger Roger (played by Jon Glover), a kindly younger man with a large Newfoundland dog, appeared in \\"Early Retirement\\". He disrupted Hyacinth's tea party plans when he went to the wrong house to pick Rose up, having mistaken Hyacinth for Rose's mother. His dog then refused to leave Hyacinth's drive, and Roger ended up leaving her there while he went in search of something to entice her away. The big dog then terrorized the pet Yorkshire Terrier of Hyacinth's honored guest. Mr. Merryweather Mr. Merryweather (played by Trevor Bannister), appeared in \\"Angel Gabriel Blue\\" and was a long- suffering, obsequious salesman in a store that sold kitchen fittings and remodeling services. Hyacinth, unaware he was involved with Rose, persuaded him to get her an out-of-stock worktop in the color Angel Gabriel Blue, so her house would be the only one in the neighborhood with the 'exclusive' color. However, the scheme backfired when Onslow found a new worktop being given away and Mr. Merryweather identified it as Angel Gabriel Blue as well, thus meaning Daisy and Onslow's house now had the \\"exclusive\\" color. Bannister's appearance on the show was a cameo, as he had previously played Mr. Lucas – almost exactly the same character, in terms of personality and occupation, as Mr. Merryweather – on the popular BBC comedy Are You Being Served?. Mr. Marinopoulous In \\"Onslow's Birthday\\" Rose infamously became involved with a wealthy Greek gentleman by the name of Mr. Marinopoulous (played by Ivan Santon), who also happened to have a limousine. Rose offered Hyacinth and Richard a ride in the limousine, to Onslow's birthday party. Hyacinth, thrilled that Rose was moving up in the world, invited people over for cocktails and bought Onslow a pair of expensive cufflinks, to impress the wealthy Greek when he arrived. However, Mr. Marinopoulos was, in fact, a well- to-do undertaker, and when the limousine broke down, he came to pick Hyacinth and Richard up in his hearse instead, in front of a crowd of guests invited to see the limousine. C.P. Benedict In \\"A Celebrity for the Barbecue\\", C.P. Benedict (played by Paul Williamson) was an acquaintance of Richard's who passed the time of day during strolls, as well as a former fling of Rose's who had parted with her on amicable terms. Furthermore, Hyacinth knew of C.P. from watching him on television, advertising his lucrative garden centre, and referred to him as \\"The Garden Centre King\\". However, none of the three were aware that either of the others knew him, until Richard happened to casually mention him in conversation with Hyacinth. Hyacinth, thinking him a celebrity, invited him to a barbecue in hopes of impressing the neighbors. She even had Richard deck the house out in live plants until it resembled a jungle, and wore one of her best dresses, only to have Rose and Daisy accidentally crash the party. C.P. gleefully reunited with Rose, much to Hyacinth's dismay. Mr. Finchley Appeared in \\"The Art Exhibition\\". The occupation of Mr. Finchley (played by Nicholas Bennett) is unknown, but he happened to own a van with loudspeakers in the roof and a microphone in the cab. He also happened to be one of Rose's most amorous pursuers. When Daddy went missing one day, Rose borrowed Mr. Finchley's vehicle to go look for him, though he ended up having to drive her. Unfortunately Mr. Finchley turned on the loudspeakers by accident, and as the two of them rode through town, everyone could hear his and Rose's rather scandalous conversation blaring at full blast, much to Hyacinth's horror. Mr. Whatsit Seen only as a silhouette in the back seat of a car, Mr. Whatsit appeared/was mentioned in two episodes, \\"The Fancy Dress Ball\\" and \\"Hyacinth is Alarmed\\". His real name was unknown, but Rose stated that it was a Polish surname with \\"too many zeds\\" in it, hence her calling him either \\"Cuddly Chops\\" or \\"Mr. Whatsit\\". He was the most serious of Rose's lovers, actually proposing to her, but Hyacinth was afraid she'd have to call Rose \\"Mrs. Whatsit\\" or \\"Mrs. Cuddly Chops\\" if the marriage came to pass. However, when he went back to Poland, he fell for a Polish woman and broke the engagement off. Rose was more philosophical about this breakup than most, musing \\"Well, I couldn't pronounce him anyway\\".  Animal characters  =Onslow's dog= Onslow's dog doesn't have a name, simply referred to as \\"Girl\\" or \\"Dog\\". In some episodes she appears as an Old English Sheepdog mix of some sort, but for the most part she appears as an Irish Wolfhound mix. She is most often found in the Hillman Avenger that has been left to rust in the front yard of Onslow's home, though she sometimes snuggles on Onslow's lap, hanging off it as she's too big to fit. Generally placid and friendly to visitors, the dog barks aggressively at only two characters: Hyacinth and Mrs Councillor Nugent, the two most disagreeable characters on the show. Onslow clearly is very fond of his dog – he feeds her scraps, takes her for car rides, and in \\"Country Estate Sale\\", when one of Daddy's fiancées shoos the dog out and stays in the old car herself, Onslow is visibly distraught and goes down the street looking for her. Richard also seems to be fond of the dog; however, he becomes unhappy with her when, in \\"A Picnic for Daddy\\", she takes a liking to Richard's suit and snuggles with him, pinning him to the couch against his wishes. In what is arguably the series' most memorable running gag, the dog startles Hyacinth into falling into the nearby hedge by barking at her from the car whenever she walks down the path to the house. Sometimes the dog startles her in other places by barking, as well, such as from a window or from the church hall car park. This habit of the dog's was also responsible for Richard's leg injury in \\"Iron Age Remains\\"; she barked at Hyacinth, who in turn jumped backwards and hit the ladder Richard was standing on, knocking him off it. In \\"Country Estate Sale\\", Hyacinth, emboldened by gooseberry wine, sneaked up on the car and barked into it to startle the dog and teach her a lesson. This backfired, however, since Daddy's fiancée was in the car instead of the dog and barked back at Hyacinth, again startling her into the hedge. = Violet and Bruce's pony = Hardly ever seen and only referenced on the phone or on the gates of Violet's house, the pony is part of a main running gag, which features Hyacinth introducing Violet on the telephone (shouting to Liz, her next-door neighbour, from the corridor) by exclaiming: \\"The one with the swimming pool, the new Mercedes and room for a pony... But not in the car!\\" Or replacing the Mercedes part with \\"...Sauna...\\" or \\"...Musical bidet...\\" and referencing the joke that there isn't room for it in the Sauna or the Musical bidet. In \\"Problems with Relatives\\", When Hyacinth and Richard plan on taking Daddy to Violet and Bruce's house, the pony makes a brief cameo in the background. The stables is also seen briefly in this episode. =Olive= Only appearing in \\"Early Retirement\\", Olive was a massive black Newfoundland that belonged to one of Rose's beaus. She was incredibly stubborn and disobedient, and caused mayhem when she sat on Hyacinth's driveway and flatly refused to get up, just as Hyacinth was expecting a prominent guest to arrive. Neither her owner nor Hyacinth could get her to move by command, so Elizabeth and Hyacinth tried pulling and pushing her instead while her owner walked off. Unfortunately, the guest (and her Yorkshire Terrier) arrived at Hyacinth's house at that moment. Olive, who liked to play with smaller dogs according to her owner, chased after the Yorkie, dragging Hyacinth down the street behind her. =Zoe the spaniel= Zoe is never seen but her actions drive much of the plot of \\"Violet's Country Cottage\\". She is reportedly a liver-and-white English Springer Spaniel belonging to Bunty and Dorian. It is revealed Bunty was training her to be a gun dog. However, Zoe is very scared of loud noises and ran away when Bunty fired the gun, and hasn't been seen since. Bunty first meets Hyacinth and Richard while trying to find Zoe, and in order to ingratiate herself with the wealthy eccentric lady, Hyacinth sends Richard to look for the dog. Richard spends much of the episode looking for Zoe, and in doing so meets Dorian, Bunty's husband, who saves him from getting stuck in a patch of nettles. Later, while still looking for Zoe and calling her name, Richard is amorously pursued by one of Daddy's girlfriends, whose first name also happens to be Zoe. =Vicar's dog= Only seen in \\"A Picnic for Daddy\\", the vicar and his wife own a fat, black and white Cocker spaniel mix. Her name is never given – like Onslow's dog, people refer to her only as \\"girl\\" or \\"the dog\\". She, like most dogs, despised Hyacinth. When Vicar gave Hyacinth a lift, with the dog riding in the boot of the car, the dog barked at her furiously and proceeded to eat all the artificial fruit off of her fancy hat. She also barked at a policeman who was following the car. =Mrs. Drummond's dogs= Also unnamed, appearing in \\"Let There Be Light\\". They belonged to a wealthy parishioner of Michael the vicar and were two Labradors, atypically vicious for the breed, who lunged at and tried to attack Hyacinth. She was eventually able to calm them and try to take them for a walk, but an ill-timed electrical explosion in the church hall spooked them into running away from her.

Sorbitan is primarily used in the production of surfactants such as polysorbates; which are important emulsifying agents, with a total annual demand of more than 10000 tons in 2012. Synthesis Sorbitan is produced by the dehydration of sorbitol and is an intermediate in the conversion of sorbitol to isosorbide. The dehydration reaction usually produces sorbitan as a mixture of five- and six-membered cyclic ethers (1,4-anhydrosorbitol, 1,5-anhydrosorbitol and 1,4,3,6-dianhydrosorbitol)Merck Index, 12th Edition, 8872 with the five-membered 1,4-anhydrosorbitol form being the dominate product. The rate of formation of sorbitan is typically greater than that of isosorbide, which allows it to be produced selectively, providing the reaction conditions are carefully controlled. The dehydration reaction has been shown to work even in the presence of excess water. 500px Surfactant derivatives =Esters= Sorbitan esters (also known as Spans) are nonionic surfactants that are used as emulsifying agents in the preparation of emulsions, creams, and ointments for pharmaceutical and cosmetic use. When used alone they produce stable water-in-oil emulsions but they are frequently used with a polysorbate in varying proportions to produce water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsions or creams with a variety of different textures and consistencies.

For passenger traffic, the port operates regular liner connections to destinations such as Tallinn, Stockholm, Saint Petersburg and Travemünde, serving a total volume of 11.6 million passengers in 2018. Additionally, it is a popular destination for international cruise ships with 520,000 passenger arrivals in 2018. In terms of combined liner and cruise passengers, it overtook the Port of Dover in 2017 to become the busiest passenger port in the world. As Finland's leading cargo port, a total of 14.7 million tonnes of goods were transported in 2018. The main export commodities are products for the forest industry, machinery and equipment, whereas in imports the most prominent product group are daily consumer goods. The port is owned by the city of Helsinki and operated by Port of Helsinki Ltd. Harbours The Port of Helsinki consists of three active harbours. =South Harbour= The South Harbour (, ) is a bay and harbour area immediately next to the centre of the city of Helsinki. Silja Line operates from the Olympia Terminal on the west side of the bay, whereas Viking Line operates from the Katajanokka Terminal on the east side of the bay. Silja Line and Viking Line each operate one ferry to Stockholm via Mariehamn per day, and Viking Line also has multiple departures to Tallinn every day. Silja Line’s MS Silja Serenade and MS Silja Symphony depart on alternate days to Stockholm Värtahamnen (via Mariehamn), Viking Line’s MS Gabriella and MS Mariella depart on alternate days to Stockholm Stadsgården (via Mariehamn) and MS Viking XPRS has multiple departures to Tallinn Terminal A every day. The Makasiini Terminal is also located on the west side of the bay but has been closed since the only regular operator, Linda Line, went bankrupt in 2017. =West Harbour= The West Harbour (, ) is a passenger and cargo harbour in the Jätkäsaari district of Helsinki. The harbour features two terminals: the older Terminal 1, and the newer Terminal 2 (completed in 2017). Tallink’s cruise service to Tallinn with MS Silja Europa, as well as St Peter Line’s cruise service to St Petersburg with MS Princess Anastasia operate from Terminal 1. Tallink’s shuttle ferries MS Megastar and MS Star to Tallinn Terminal D as well as Eckerö Line’s shuttle ferry MS Finlandia to Tallinn Terminal A operate from Terminal 2. The West Harbour area also includes the Munkkisaari Quay on the west side of neighbouring Munkkisaari, used by cruise ships in the summer. There is no terminal here, and cruise passengers are transported to Central Helsinki by shuttle buses. =Vuosaari Harbour= Vuosaari Harbour (, ) is located in the suburb of Vuosaari and was opened in November 2008. It replaced the North Harbour and Laajasalo Oil Harbour and serves primarily container and Roll-on/roll-off traffic. The majority of passenger services operate from the other two harbours in Central Helsinki with the exception of Finnlines’ daily service to Travemünde on MS Finnstar, MS Finnmaid and MS Finnlady. Passengers on this ferry service check in at the Hansa Terminal and are transport to the ship by bus.

The Tsemes Bay (also Tsemess Bay and Novorossiysk Bay; Russian: Цемесская бухта, Tsemesskaya bukhta) is an ice-free bay located on the northern coast of the Black Sea, in Krasnodar Krai of Russia. It takes its name from the Tsemes River which flows into the bay. The depth of the sea varies from 21 to 27 meters. The length of the bay is 15 kilometers; its maximum width is 9 kilometers. It is bordered by the Sudzhuk Spit and Cape Doob. Although the navigation is affected by strong autumn and winter bora winds (up to 220 kilometers per hour), the bay was frequented by ancient Greek navigators who established the colony of Bata on the shore. Michael Rostovtzeff explained this by the fact that there are no other decent harbours along the coastline all the way to Batumi.Rostovtzeff, Michael Ivanovich. Iranians and Greeks in South Russia. The Clarendon Press, 1922. Page 63. During the Middle Ages, the coast was controlled by the Ghisolfi merchant family of Genoa. Novorossiysk, founded by Russians as a military facility, is the chief port on the bay. Several ships of the Black Sea Fleet were scuttled in the bay to avoid their capture by the Germans in 1918. It was also the scene of several notable shipwrecks, including that of SS Admiral Nakhimov in 1986.

The church has about 400 members, and approximately 150 people attend on any Sunday. The current priest-in-charge is the Rev. Lucy Reid. The church's history begins with Pastor H. Dixon who set up a tent around 1880 to serve the residents of the small village in the area. When the streetcar stretched eastward and the area began to grow rapidly in the 1890s, the church remained housed in a tent, but one large enough to hold 500 people. A permanent church was finally established in 1907, and work on the church building was completed in 1908. St. Aidan's has many pieces of liturgical art by the distinguished Canadian artist and late parishioner Doris McCarthy. In 2006, the church became the centre of a controversy when the congregation under Rev. Stephen Kirkegaard decided to participate in the Out of the Cold program to provide shelter to the homeless during the winter. The program takes place in various religious institutions across the city, and helps provide extra space during the winter months when remaining outside can be deadly. St. Aidan's proposed providing beds for twelve people once a week. This sparked strenuous opposition from neighbours in the expensive Beaches area. Concerns about the homeless bringing crime and reducing property values in the neighbourhood prompted some local residents to try to get a court order to halt the program. Eventually, after a meeting was held to allay concerns, and critical publicity began to decry the objections, the program went ahead. In 2017, they plan to serve fifty for dinner, and host twenty-five homeless men and women for the night and breakfast.

Description It grows as an upright, open shrub from one to two or sometimes three metres high. It has angular, ridged branchlets and long, straight leaves from three to eleven centimetres long, and one to five millimetres wide. Flowers are white, sometimes with a faint pink tinge. As with other Grevillea species they occur in an inflorescence of many flowers. Taxonomy The species was first formally described in James Edward Smith's 1793 A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland as Embothrium sericeum var. angustifolium. This was overlooked, however, by Cavanilles, who in 1797 published the same species as Embothrium linearifolium. In 1917 Cavanilles' species was transferred into Grevillea as G. linearifolia by George Druce. Smith's prior publication would not be discovered until 2000. Other synonyms include: * Grevillea linearis R.Br. * Lysanthe linearifolia (Cav.) Knight * Embothrium lineare Andrews The taxonomic limits of G. linearifolia are difficult to establish. In addition to variations between populations, the species is said to form \\"an intergrading complex\\" with G. parviflora, and may intergrade with G. patulifolia and/or G. humilis subsp. humilis. It is also known to hybridise often with G. sericea, and occasional hybrids with G. diffusa subsp. filipendula have also been reported. Distribution and habitat The species is endemic to eastern New South Wales. It occurs mainly from Gosford and Putty, south to the Parramatta River and Port Jackson. There are also some disjunct populations that differ slightly from the Gosford form, but have been placed provisionally in this species. These occur near Lawson in the lower Blue Mountains, just inland from Ulladulla, and near Nowra. The species has also been reported to occur in Victoria, for example in the 4th edition of A Census of the Vascular Plants of Victoria, but according to the Australian Plant Census these collections actually belong to a range of other species, specifically: G. alpivaga, G. neurophylla, G. patulifolia, G. gariwerdensis and G. micrantha. It grows in moist but well-drained soils, mostly sandy soils over sandstone; its habitat is generally amongst shrubby eucalypt woodland.

Blair in turn traded through, and relied upon cattle markets expertise from broker Robert L. \\"Red\\" Bone of Refco, a former Tyson executive. In October 1978, when Bill Clinton was Attorney General and on the verge of being elected Governor, Clinton opened a trading account, although Blair made most of the trades. By January 1979, Clinton was up $26,000; but later, she would lose $16,000 in a single trade. At one point she owed in excess of $100,000 to Refco as part of covering losses, but no margin calls were made by Refco against her. Near the end of her trading, Blair correctly predicted a market downturn and sold short, giving her a $40,000 gain in one afternoon. In July 1979, once she became pregnant with Chelsea Clinton, \\"I lost my nerve for gambling [and] walked away from the table $100,000 ahead.\\" She briefly traded sugar futures contracts and other non-cattle commodities in October 1979, but more conservatively, through Stephens Inc. During this period she made about $6,500 in gains, which she failed to pay taxes on at the time, consequently later paying some $14,600 in federal and state tax penalties in the 1990s.Bill Montague; Kevin Johnson, \\"Commodities trading saga: Pieces still missing\\", USA Today, April 25, 1994. Accessed December 14, 2012. Once her daughter was born in February 1980, she moved all her commodities gains into U.S. Treasury Bonds. Media scrutiny The profits made during the cattle trading first came to public light in a March 18, 1994 report by The New York Times, which had been reviewing the Clintons' financial records for two months.Jeff Gerth, \\" Top Arkansas Lawyer Helped Hillary Clinton Turn Big Profit\\", The New York Times, March 18, 1994. On March 28, 1994, Securities Week, a McGraw-Hill Companies publication, published an article outlining the repeated regulatory violations committed by her broker, Red Bone, which resulted in greater scrutiny and questions not only about how much money she had made in the markets, but how she had made it. Accessed July 14, 2007. It coincided with the beginning of congressional hearings over the Whitewater controversy.Bob Herbert, \\"The Circus That Is Whitewater\\", The New York Times, March 20, 1994. Accessed April 6, 2008. Clinton initially told aides that she had made the futures gains by studying the financial news and placing trades herself, but later acknowledged the help of Blair. Media pressure continued to build, and on April 22, 1994, she gave an unusual press conference under a portrait of Abraham Lincoln in the State Dining Room of the White House, to address questions on both matters; it was broadcast live by CBS, NBC, ABC, and CNN.Gwen Ifill, \\"Hillary Clinton Takes Questions on Whitewater\\", The New York Times, April 23, 1994. Accessed July 15, 2007. In it she said she had done the trading, but often relying upon the advice of Blair, and having him place orders for her; she said she did not believe she had received preferential treatment in the process. She also downplayed the dangers of such trading: \\"I didn't think it was that big a risk. [Blair] and the people he was talking with knew what they were doing.\\" Likelihood of results Various publications sought to analyze the likelihood of Clinton's successful results. Clinton made her money by betting mostly on a market downturn at a time when cattle prices actually doubled. The editor of the Journal of Futures Markets said in April 1994, \\"This is like buying ice skates one day and entering the Olympics a day later. She took some extraordinary risks.\\"Mark Hosenball, Rich Thomas, and Eleanor Clift, \\"Hillary's Adventures In Cattle Futures Land\\", Newsweek, April 11, 1994. Accessed March 2, 2009. Her activities involved exposure to losses that could have been greater than her family's net worth if the market had turned sharply against her. The former head of the IRS chief counsel’s Commodities Industry Specialization Team expressed skepticism that a novice trader could make such a return. One analysis performed by Auburn University and published in the Journal of Economics and Finance claimed to find that the odds of a return as large as Clinton obtained during the period in question were about one in 31 trillion. Merc and Melamed investigations Chicago Mercantile Exchange records indicated that $40,000 of her profits came from larger trades initiated by James Blair. According to exchange records, \\"Red\\" Bone, the commodities broker that facilitated the trades on behalf of Refco, reportedly because Blair was a good client, allowed Clinton to maintain her positions even though she did not have enough money in her account to cover her activity. For example, she was allowed to order 10 cattle futures contracts, normally a $12,000 investment, in her first commodity trade in 1978 although she had only $1,000 in her account at the time.Charles R. Babcock, \\"Hillary Clinton Futures Trades Detailed\\", The Washington Post, May 27, 1994. Accessed July 14, 2007. Bone denied any wrongdoing in conjunction with Clinton's trading and said he did not recall ever dealing with Clinton personally. As it happened, during the period of Clinton's trading, Refco was under investigation by the Mercantile Exchange for systematic violations of its margin trading rules and reporting requirements regarding cattle trading. In December 1979, the exchange issued a three-year suspension to Bone and a $250,000 fine of Refco (at the time, the largest such penalty imposed by the exchange). After the Clinton trading matter became public, Leo Melamed, a former chairman of the Mercantile Exchange, was brought in by request of the White House to review the trading records. On April 11, 1994, he said that the whole matter was \\"a tempest in a teapot\\" and that while her brokers had not required her to provide typical margin cushions, she had not knowingly benefited.Gwen Ifill, \\" Hillary Clinton Didn't Report $6,498 Profit In Commodities Account, White House Says\\", The New York Times, April 12, 1994. Accessed July 15, 2007. On May 26, 1994, after the new records concerning the larger Blair trades came to light, he said \\"I have no reason to change my original assessment. Mrs. Clinton violated no rules in the course of her transactions.\\" But as to the question of whether she had been allocated profits from larger block trades, he said of the new accounting, \\"It doesn't suggest that there was allocation, and it doesn't prove there wasn't,\\"Stephen Engelberg, \\"New Records Outline Favor for Hillary Clinton on Trades\\", The New York Times, May 27, 1994.

Clinton responses Hillary Clinton's defenders, including White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler, maintained throughout that she had made her own decisions, that her own money was constantly at risk, and that she made both winning and losing trades throughout the ten months.\\" No One Bribed Anyone in Clinton Trading\\", Lloyd Cutler (letter to the editor), The New York Times, June 3, 1994. Accessed July 15, 2007. Regarding suggestions that Blair had favored Clinton so that Tyson Foods could gain influence with Governor Clinton, they pointed out that CEO Don Tyson, who had in 1978 endorsed Clinton, in 1980 endorsed Frank D. White, Clinton's opponent in his reelection bid. Tyson denied any knowledge of Blair's trading partnership with Clinton. The New York Times noted, however, that notwithstanding Hillary Clinton's \\"artful explanation\\", the commodities trading had ended over a year before the 1980 election and that Tyson had switched sides after Bill Clinton did not lobby the state legislature to increase the weight limit on trucks, although Tyson believed that he had received such a promise from him at the time of the 1978 election. Clinton's defenders also stressed that Blair and others stayed in the market longer than Clinton and lost much of what they had previously earned, showing that the risk was real. Indeed, some reports had Blair losing $15 millionRoger Morris, Partners in Power: The Clintons and Their America. Henry Holt, 1996. , p. 233. and Bone was reported as bankrupt.

It designates states that operate by democratic systems (elections are held, governments fall, freedom of speech), but whose application is progressively limited. A small elite is taking the tough decisions and co-opts the democratic institutions. Crouch further developed the idea in an article called Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy? By Colin Crouch. Policy Network, 5 May 2011. for the think tank Policy Network and in his subsequent book The Strange Non-Death of Neo- Liberalism. Colin Crouch introduced the term post-democracy in 2000.The term was used by Crouch to design an evolution within democracies during the 21st century.[citation needed] It is a polemical term because it calls attention to recognized democracies that are losing some of their foundations and evolving towards an aristocratic regime. The term may also denote a general conception of a post-democratic system that may involve other structures of group decision-making and governance than the ones found in contemporary or historical democracy.  Definition  By Crouch's definition: Crouch states that we are not \\"living in a post-democratic society, but that we were moving towards such a condition\\".  Causes  Crouch names the following reasons: * No common goals: For people in the post-industrial society it is increasingly difficult, in particular for the underclass, to identify themselves as a group and therefore difficult to focus on political parties that represent them. For instance laborers, farmers or entrepreneurs no longer feel attracted to one political movement and this means that there is no common goal for them as a group to get united. * Globalization: The effect of globalization makes it almost impossible for nations to work out their own economic policy. Therefore, large trade agreements and supranational unions (e.g., the European Union) are used to make policy but this level of politics is very hard to control with democratic instruments. Globalization additionally endows transnational corporations with more political leverage given their ability to avoid federal regulation and directly affect domestic economies. * Non- balanced debates: In most democratic countries the positions of the political parties have become very much alike. This means that there is not much to choose from for its voters. The effect is that political campaigns are looking more like advertising to make the differences look bigger. Also the private lives of the politicians have become an important item in elections. Sometimes \\"sensitive\\" issues stay undiscussed. The English conservative journalist Peter Oborne presented a documentary of the 2005 general election, arguing that it had become anti-democratic because it targeted a number of floating voters with a narrow agenda. * Entanglement between public and private sector: There are large shared interests between politics and business. Through lobbying companies, multinational corporations are able to bring about legislation more effectively than the inhabitants of a country. Corporations and governments are in close relation because states need corporations as they are great employers. But as much of the production is outsourced, and corporations have almost no difficulty in moving to other countries, labor law becomes employee- unfriendly and tax bites are moved from companies to individuals. It becomes more common for politicians and managers to switch jobs (the 'revolving door'). * Privatization: Then there is the neoliberal idea of new public management (neoliberalism) of privatizing public services. Privatized institutions are difficult to control by democratic means and have no allegiance to human communities, unlike government. Crouch uses the term “phantom firms” to describe the flexibility and elusive nature of firms which bend to the market. He concludes that private firms have incentive to make individual profit rather than better the welfare of the public. For example, he states that there is a problem with pharmaceutical companies funding (and skewing) medical research.  Consequences  As a consequence: * Fewer voters use their right to vote, or do vote but don't expect much. * Politicians can ignore an undesirable outcome of a referendum or opinion poll. For instance in 2005 when France and the Netherlands voted \\"No\\" in a referendum about the European Constitution these countries still ratified the treaty after only minor modifications were made, and the British Members of Parliament (MPs) who advocated revoking the Article 50 process to leave the European Union without a second referendum, which was the policy of the Liberal Democrats following the 2016 referendum, in which the electorate voted in favour of withdrawing from the EU. * The rise of xenophobic and other populist parties who capitalise on prevailing discontent. * Foreign governments can influence the internal politics of a sovereign country. According to Crouch, the way the eurozone crisis was handled is the best example of how things work in a post- democracy. European leaders managed to bring about a new government taking office in Italy, and in Greece far-reaching austerity measures were put in place, contrary to the vote in a popular referendum. * Private interest becomes increasingly influential in public policy.  Solutions  According to Crouch there is an important task for social media in which voters can participate more actively in public debates. In addition, these voters would have to join advocacy groups for specific interests. The citizens have to reclaim their place in decision making. He calls this post-post-democracy. The Occupy movement was a form of more or less disorganized opposition that grew out of the dissatisfaction with to the power of the banking industry. Belgian historian David van Reybrouck describes in his book Against elections the current problems in Western democracy as the democratic fatigue syndrome. As a solution he advocates a deliberative democracy based on sortition.

The game was devised by Rufus Isaacs and published in his book Differential Games (1965) as follows: This game remained a well- known open problem until it was solved by Shmuel Gal in the late 1970s.S. Gal, SEARCH GAMES, Academic Press, New York (1980). His optimal strategy for the princess is to move to a random location in the room and stay still for a time interval which is neither too short nor too long, before going to another (independent) random location and repeating the procedure. The proposed optimal search strategy, for the monster, is based on subdividing the room into many narrow rectangles, picking a rectangle at random and searching it in some specific way, after some time picking another rectangle randomly and independently, and so on. Princess and monster games can be played on a pre- selected graph. It can be demonstrated that for any finite graph an optimal mixed search strategy exists that results in a finite payoff. This game has been solved by Steve Alpern and independently by Mikhail Zelikin only for the very simple graph consisting of a single loop (a circle). The value of the game on the unit interval (a graph with two nodes with a link in-between) has been estimated approximatively. The game appears simple but is quite complicated. The obvious search strategy of starting at a random end and \\"sweeping\\" the whole interval as fast as possible guarantees a 0.75 expected capture time, and is not optimal. By utilising a more sophisticated mixed searcher and hider strategy, one can reduce the expected capture time by about 8.6%. This number would be quite close to the value of the game if someone was able to prove the optimality of the related strategy of the princess.S. Alpern, R. Fokkink, R. Lindelauf, and G. J. Olsder.

The band started out as a song writing project, the brothers curious to see if they could mix their influences of pop, rock and jazz into their own brand of power pop with ambiguous lyrics and smart arrangements. When pushed by pop enthusiasts to record some of the songs, they realized that they had to put a band together. Janne Hellman was recruited as lead vocalist together with Mikael Olsson on bass, Olsson who had previous worked with the brothers in the hi-speed pop outfit Revolver Bop Agents. First release Private Jets released the debut EP “A Four Leaf Clover in E-Major” on May 27, 2002 on Sparkplug Records. It contained four songs and a short snippet and was well received by the power pop community. The songs were written, arranged, produced and to a large extent performed by the brothers. Lead vocals was provided by Janne Hellman on all tracks and Olsson played bass on the song Millionseller. In a radio interview on Swedish Radio, Erik Westin explained that the band were basically writing what they wanted to hear but couldn’t really seem to find anywhere. He also said that the ambition with the band is to write the ultimate pop song over and over again. Second release After the release of “A Four Leaf Clover in E-Major” the brothers started to work on a new album. The band bio states that they wrote 43 new songs to be able to make an album filled with singles only. It says that they would strive for nothing less than power pop perfection. Of the songs written, the band chose to record twelve, and the result can be heard on the album “Jet Sounds”, released on May 26, 2008. Live gigs In May 2008 Private Jets made their live debut at the Cavern Club in Liverpool, playing the International Pop Overthrow. An extra show was added.

Voices about Jet Sounds  ”Unlike most of their brethren, Private Jets go beyond mere stylistic worship to forge their own sound. The cleverly titled Jet Sounds is a gorgeous slab of retro-pop but what really seals the deal is the four-song EP, A FOUR LEAF CLOVER IN E MAJOR. Too many highlights on the album, but “Extraordinary Sensations,” “Speak Up, Speak Out,” and “Fireman for a Day” and its follow-up “Fire Academy” all have that Brill Building ethic.” Mike Baron's Top Ten Records of 2008! Monday, December 15, 2008 ”All the way from Sweden come Private Jets, whose Jet Sounds (wink, nudge) on Sparkplug Records is a spectacular distillation of bands such as Jellyfish, The Cars and The Beach Boys. A dozen glorious, sing-along tunes laced with perky synthesizers, shiny harmonies and punchy guitars all add up to another release that deserves to be heard by many. Random thoughts on this one: Ringo Starr should cover “Starshaped World;” “Speak Up, Speak Out” recalls “Ain’t That a Shame;” the dorky lyrics to “First Division of Love” add to the song’s charm; and “I Wanna Be a Private Jet” is the finest musical self-reference since Prince’s “My Name is Prince.” John M. Borack, Goldmine, November 14, 2008 ”Swedish power pop has a great rep. Bands like Private Jets merely confirms why. Believe me, listening to this talented quartet, will leave you with a sugar rush. Throwing in every pop cliche in the book, from show tunes to Jellyfish riffs, enveloped with high-octane harmonies, toe-tapping rhythms, sensual chord changes and sweet sweet tunes, Private Jets don’t give pop junkies much of a chance of losing the habit. And the Beach Boys references are not limited to the album title - I mean, The Fire Academy contains jazz vocal arrangements that Brian Wilson himself would be impressed with. Elsewhere, you will catch the McCartney inflections (Jet!) on tracks like I Wanna Be A Private Jet, Speak Up, Speak Out and Starshaped World. If you’ve got the McCartney/Wilson camp on your side, chances are that the pop underground will adopt you as its own. Beyond that, I don’t know but anyone with a sweet tooth will find it hard to resist Jet Sounds.” Powerofpop.com, September 12, 2008 Voices about the debut EP “Target in My Heart” and “Magic” are over-the-top, Jellyfish ambitious, suite-like compositions with gorgeous harmonies. “Magic” is a bodacious sunrise of a song with a soaring chorus and the line “My heart is beating like Keith Moon,” followed by the most exquisite a cappella since Take 6.” Mike Baron's Top Ten Records of 2008!

John Wilkinson the School's newly appointed Headteacher addressed the concerns by stating that the results in this regard had under-performed because the Biology syllabus needed to be restructured, and the Mathematics results had been impaired by the admission of sixth-form students with lower GCSE grades than was standard educational practice, citing the need for schools to \\"be brave\\" in such matters, and not play safe in pursuance of short-term results statistics.'Teddington School Headmaster defends \\"extremely worrying\\" exam results', 'Richmond & Twickenham Times', 1 October 2015. https://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/13798101.teddington-school- headmaster-defends-extremely-worrying-exam-results/ In September 2017 on his appointment to the post of Chief Executive of the Richmond West Schools' Trust, John Wilkinson was re-designated as the Teddington School's 'Executive Headteacher', with Kathy Pacey being appointed as its new 'Head of School'.'Richmond School's new Chief Executive hails rapid improvement', Richmond & Twickenham Times', 11 October 2017. https://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/15589623.richmond-schools- new-chief-executive-hails-rapid-improvement/ In February 2018 Ofsted praised the functioning of the school's sixth form, but rated Teddington School otherwise as \\"Requiring Improvement\\", citing after an inspection in January 2018 concerns with: the main school's management; aspects of its quality of teaching - which was described as generally 'not good enough'; pupils being inattentive and pettily disruptive in some classes; that the school's internal administrative self-evaluation reporting had been found to be inaccurate to the degree that it created an overly generous impression of the school's working state, and a Governing body that was not properly executing its role of independent scrutiny of the school's managerial authority, which it had become too close to.

The Alliance for CO2 Solutions supports the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a refrigerant in passenger cars, and the chemical industry is developing new chemical blends.The Choice Today - New Chemical Blends or CO2 The Alliance and its supporters – scientists, NGOs and business leaders – urge the car industry to replace high global warming chemical substances with the natural refrigerant carbon dioxide (CO2, R744/ R-744) in car cooling and heating. This, they argue, would lead to 10% less car emissions, and knock out 1% of total greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.Car Air Conditioning & the Climate Change Challenge - Made Simple If CO2 Technology is applied in other sectors, such as commercial and industrial refrigeration, heat pumps for water heating etc., it may even save up to 3% of the world's greenhouse gases. Opponents of the Alliance claim that CO2 Technology is not cost-efficient and safe, hence seeking to postpone the global industry decision to be taken to develop new chemical blends instead. Background A debate had emanated from the decision of the European Union to phase out the current high global warming refrigerant HFC-134a in car air conditioning from January 2011 onwards. To comply with the legislation, carmakers have to decide on new refrigerants as they typically need 3 to 4 years to develop and introduce a new car platform including the air conditioning system. Arguments =Arguments for CO2= The Alliance for CO2 Solutions and its supporters agree that the refrigerant CO2 is: *More environmentally friendly with the lowest Global warming potential (GWP) of all currently used and proposed refrigerants. CO2 does not deplete the ozone layer. Since the carbon dioxide used in car air conditioning is a recycled industrial waste product it becomes environmentally neutral. Overall, using a CO2-based air conditioning system will reduce total car emissions by 10%, thereby sparing the planet 1% of total greenhouse gases. *More technically ready because CO2 models have been developed and tested in all climates, being now ready for mass production. They are faster to heat and cool a car, and show a superior performance in over 90% of all driving conditions. *More cost-efficient because as a refrigerant itself, CO2 is cheap and worldwide available. The servicing of CO2 systems will be less costly and less complicated than that for present systems. For the consumer the total cost of ownership is lowest with CO2 as it will significantly cut fuel consumption by the air conditioning device. Carmakers have to make an initial investment estimated at €20 per unit, with no additional costs once CO2 Technology enters into mass production. *Usable in Heat Pumps because at least one CO2 system under development can act as a heat pump, supplying cabin heat and windshield defrosting even before the engine has warmed up.Visteon's R744 system *Although the Alliance may not mention it, since CO2 is so cheap and relatively harmless to the environment, the reservoirs in such systems could store additional liquid R744 to keep a vehicle cool even when the engine (or compressor) was not running. =Arguments against CO2= CO2 Technology requires the design of completely new high-pressure systems whereas so-called \\"drop-in solutions\\" (the adaptation of current systems to new substances) are potentially more cost-efficient. The Alliance for CO2 Solutions claims, however that the initial costs of CO2 systems will be around €5 higher than drop-in solutions and that over a car's life cycle, CO2 air conditioning systems will be more cost-efficient than any currently used or proposed new chemical blends. (see Arguments for CO2). has been classified as Safety Class A1 (low-toxic, non-flammable refrigerant) by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)ASHRAE Standard 34 – the highest safety class possible. As the charge of CO2 to the air conditioning systems is very small (200-400 g) there is no realistic danger for the passengers, even in case of accidental release. =Arguments for non-CO2 refrigerants= *Refrigerants such as the greenpeace-developed 'Greenfreeze', based on purified butane/propane mixtures, are entirely 'natural', and due to increased efficiency over refrigerants such as R134a, allow the use of very small amounts of refrigerant to be used. *Use of pure hydrocarbon refrigerants, which are 'backward compatible' with even early Freon (R-12) car air conditioning systems, would allow these systems to be easily converted (without modification), increasing their efficiency, and preventing further release of harmful R-134a and R-12 to the atmosphere. =Arguments against non-CO2 refrigerants= Butane and propane are very flammable petroleum products; they are used as fuels for gas barbecue grills, disposable lighters, etc. Like gasoline, to which it chemically is closely related, propane has a tendency to explode if mixed with oxygen and ignited in an enclosed container. The use of highly flammable hydrocarbon gases such as butane and propane as automotive refrigerants raises serious safety concerns. The EPA, in evaluating motor vehicle air conditioning substitutes for CFC-12 (Freon, or R-12) under its SNAP program, has classified as \\"Unacceptable Substitutes\\" other \\"Flammable blend[s] of hydrocarbons\\" by reason of \\"insufficient data to demonstrate safety.\\" The EPA defines \\"Unacceptable\\" in this context as \\"illegal for use as a CFC-12 substitute in motor vehicle air conditioners\\". All of the refrigerants which EPA approved for motor vehicle use in place of CFC-12 (as of 28 September 2006) contain no more than 4% total flammable hydrocarbons (butane, isobutane, and/or isopentane).http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/refrigerants/macssubs.html#otherinfo EPA: Choosing and Using Alternative Refrigerants for Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning Therefore, it appears unlikely, for safety reasons, that EPA will approve 'Greenfreeze' or similar hydrocarbon-based refrigerants for automotive use. Latest and next steps In September 2007, the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) officially announced its decision to use CO2 as the refrigerant in next-generation air conditioning. Other carmakers from Europe and the rest of the world may follow the German lead. A working group at ACEA, the European carmakers' association, was to be drafting a common position on the issue to be adopted across the whole industry by end-2007. However, on 9 April 2009, German public television channel ARD aired a report claiming that VDA members would be using loopholes in the law to avoid complying with the EU directive.German TV explains car industry boycott of EU law Positions *Deutsche Umwelthilfe - Press Release 6 September 2007 *Greenpeace Germany - News Release 6 September 2007 *Alliance for CO2 Solutions - Press Release 6 September 2007 *Alliance for CO2 Solutions - Press Release 30 July 2007 *Alliance for CO2 Solutions - Press Release 13 June 2007 *Deutsche Umwelthilfe - Press Release 13 July 2007 *German Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt) - Press Release 8 May 2007 Media coverage *Spiegel-Online.de (06/09/2007) *ENDS Europe Report - August edition European Voice (07/07/12) *Euractiv (07/06/26) *[(07/06/18)] See also *Automobile air conditioning *EcoCute, an energy efficient electric heat pump that uses carbon dioxide as a refrigerant  References  External links *R744.com Website dedicated to CO2 Technology *Shecco.com * Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning Category:Automotive cooling systems Category:Sustainable design ","title":"Sustainable automotive air conditioning"},{"id":"12249119","text":"HMS Unshaken (P54) was a Royal Navy U-class submarine built by Vickers- Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness. She has been the only vessel of the Royal Navy to bear the name Unshaken. Career After a period operating off the coast of Norway, Unshaken spent most of her wartime career in the Mediterranean. Whilst in northern waters, on 5 July 1942, Unshaken radioed in a sighting and an exact description of a heavy German force - including the Tirpitz, Admiral Scheer and Admiral Hipper - at sea in pursuit of the ill-fated convoy PQ 17 off north Norway. Hearing of these allied sighting reports (also made by the Russian submarine K-21 and a Catalina patrol aircraft) through intelligence, Admiral Raeder cancelled the sortie, ordering the surface fleet to return to port and left the Luftwaffe and U-boats to attack the convoy. The convoy lost 24 ships out of 40, but it could have been even worse for the convoy if the heavy force had remained at sea. Unshaken also sank the German merchant Georg L.M. Russ off southern Norway, before being reassigned to the Mediterranean in late 1942. While serving in the Mediterranean, she sank the Italian merchant ships Foggia and Pomo (the former Yugoslavian Nico Matkovic), the Italian torpedo boat Climene, the Italian sailing vessel Giovanni G., the Italian auxiliary patrol vessel No 265 / Cesena, and the Italian troop transport Asmara. She also damaged the Italian tanker Dora C.. She launched unsuccessful attacks against the French merchantman Oasis, the Italian merchant vessels Pomo, Nina and Campania, and the French passenger/cargo ship Cap Corse. Unshaken had a narrow escape after she was attacked by four torpedoes launched by the Polish submarine ORP Dzik. The Poles thought they were attacking an enemy submarine, but luckily the torpedoes missed their target. Unshaken captured the Italian submarine Menolti on the night that Italy ceased hostilities and escorted her to Malta. Lieutenant Commander Jack Whitton, Unshakens commander, ordered the boat to surface after her hydrophone operator reported 'high speed revs'. He then decided to board the Italian vessel as her bridge was crowded with people and could not dive quickly. A shot from the deck gun across the bows of the Italian submarine was followed by a return burst from an automatic weapon which was suppressed by machine gun fire from the British boat. Unshaken then came alongside the Mentoli and able seaman Ronald \\"Sharky\\" Ward boarded the Italian vessel and secured the conning tower hatch to prevent her from diving. He was armed with a pistol, but unknown to Sharky it was unloaded, an envelope provided to the seaman when receiving his orders and the pistol contained the bullets. There followed a robust verbal exchange in which the Italian skipper wanted to go to Brindisi, whereas Whitton insisted on Malta. The situation looked as if it might turn ugly until the loaded deckgun was pointed at the Italian commander from a distance of about 13 ft (4m).Field Marshal Lord Carver - The War in Italy 1943-1945, 2001, Sidwick and Jackson, . pp. 60-62 After returning to home waters in mid-1944, Unshaken sank the German merchant Asien off Lista in Norway. Unshaken survived the war and was scrapped at Troon in March 1946.

History  In the year 1946, the name of the institution was changed to The Central Polytechnic, Madras and the institution was then conducting seven full-time diploma courses of three years duration each in (i) Civil Engineering (ii) Mechanical Engineering (iii) Electrical Engineering (iv) Sanitary Engineering (v) Printing Technology (vi) Cinematography and Sound Engineering (vii) Fisheries Technology and Navigation. The Printing Technology section was developed into a full-fledged Institution under the name of \\"Regional School of Printing, Madras\\" and separated from the Central Polytechnic during the academic year 1958-59. The Cinematography and Sound Engineering section was reorganised and developed into a full-fledged Institution called \\"The Institute of Film Technology, Madras\\" during the academic year 1960-61. In the beginning, Madras Trade School was located in a rented building. In course of time, separate building for the Institution was constructed and the Institution moved to its own building at Broadway, in the year 1924. Till the academic year 1957-58 the Institution was functioning at Broadway, Madras. Owing to the rapid expansion during the Second Five-Year Plan, the Institution had to be shifted in the year 1958-59 to Guindy, near the Industrial Estate, where new building was constructed at a cost of about Rs.14 Lakhs. But with further development of the Institution and expansion of its activities during the Third Five-Year Plan, the need for more spacious building and playgrounds etc., was felt, and only of land was available at Guindy which could not permit additional buildings being put up. Therefore, lands to the extent of 40 hectares were initially acquired in the present premises at Adyar, for construction of new buildings. This further led to the acquisition of another 3221 hectare to accommodate other technical institutions such as the Institute of Leather Technology, Institute of Textile Technology, Institute of Chemical Technology, and the Institute of Film Technology, various other buildings have also been built during the year 1960-64. The Central Polytechnic College consists of the following buildings constructed at a cost of Rs.72 Lakhs: 1\\\\. Central Polytechnic Main Building 2\\\\. Workshops 3\\\\. Nehru Auditorium 4\\\\.

It spans from Burbank in the west to Waitsburg in the east, intersecting U.S. Route 12 (US 12) at both ends. The highway generally follows the Snake and Touchet rivers and intersects SR 125 near Prescott. SR 124 was previously part of two state highways: Secondary State Highway 3D (SSH 3D) from Burbank to Prescott, and SSH 3E from Prescott to Waitsburg. During the 1964 state highway renumbering, sections of both highways were formed to SR 124, which was officially named Ice Harbor Road and designated as a state scenic byway by the state legislature. Route description A section of SR 124 passing through downtown Waitsburg near its terminus with US 12 SR 124 begins at a dogbone interchange with US 12 in Burbank on the eastern shore of the Snake River near its confluence with the Columbia River in Pasco (part of the Tri-Cities). The highway travels east from the interchange onto Ice Harbor Drive after passing Hood Park on the shore of the Snake River and a local branch library. The two-lane road is rural with a speed limit of as it passes north of the McNary National Wildlife Refuge. SR 124 dips northeast and crosses over a set of railroad tracks carrying the Ayer Subdivision of the Union Pacific Railroad north towards the Ice Harbor Lock and Dam. The highway then turns northeast and ascends a ridge that overlooks the Snake River, which continues north while SR 124 travels east through the Eureka Flat. SR 124 descends into the Touchet River Valley below the rolling hills of the Palouse and follows the river east through Lamar and Harsha alongside an abandoned railroad grade. The highway crosses over Lyons Ferry Road with an overpass and intersects the north end of SR 125 on the outskirts of Prescott, approximately north of Walla Walla. SR 124 continues east through Prescott and turns southeast to follow the Columbia Walla Walla Railroad, a shortline railroad connecting Walla Walla to Dayton. At Bolles, the highway turns south to cross over the Touchet River and makes a gradual turn to the east as it approaches Waitsburg. SR 124 travels through the town on West 2nd Street and briefly turns south on Main Street before continuing east for one block on Preston Avenue to the highway's terminus at US 12. US 12 then continues east on Preston Avenue and beyond Waitsburg to Dayton and Clarkston. SR 124 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and designated as part of the Lewis and Clark Trail Scenic Byway, a state scenic byway. A short section of the highway in Burbank is also listed on the National Highway System. WSDOT conducts an annual survey of average traffic volume on the state highway system that is measured in terms of average annual daily traffic. Traffic volumes on SR 124 range from a minimum of 1,400 vehicles between Prescott and Boles to a maximum of 7,000 vehicles near Hood Park in Burbank. History Most of the current route of SR 124 follows a portion of the Lewis and Clark Trail. The highway from Piper Canyon Road to Waitsburg follows a small section of the route that Lewis and Clark took from Fort Clatsop in May 1806 before splitting in Montana.https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/cvo/Historical/LewisClark/volcanoes_lewis_clark_may_1806.shtml SR 124 became a state highway during the 1964 highway renumbering, in which the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) replaced the old system (Primary and Secondary Highways) with a new system (State Routes), which is still in use today. In the Primary and Secondary system, SR 124 from US 12 to SR 125 (then US 410) was Secondary State Highway 3D and SR 124 from SR 125 to SR 126 was Secondary State Highway 3E. Secondary State Highway 3D (SSH 3D) was added in 1937, during the creation of the Primary State Highway system. The original route started at US 410 in Touchet and went north to Eureka and east to SSH 3E west of Prescott.: \\"Secondary State Highway No. 3D; beginning at Touchet on Primary State Highway No. 3, thence in a northerly direction by the most feasible route to a point south of Eureka, thence in an easterly direction by the most feasible route to Prescott.\\" The highway connecting Burbank to SSH 3D was a toll road built by the 1930s.Rand McNally Road Map: 1939 Later in 1951, SSH 3D was moved to a route from US 410 in Burbank to SSH 3E, the current route of SR 124 and in 1965, the route from Burbank to Ice Harbor Road was designated the Ice Harbor Drive.Session Laws of the State of Washington. 1964 Title 47, Chapter 47.17, Section 47.17.235. \\"That portion of state route number 124 lying between the junction with state route number 12 and the county road to Ice Harbor Dam to be known as \\"Ice Harbor Drive\\".\\" SSH 3E was also added in 1937 and went from US 410 in Walla Walla north to SSH 3D and east past Prescott to Waitsburg. SSH 3E became SR 125 from Walla Walla to SSH 3D and SR 124 from SSH 3D to Waitsburg.: \\"Secondary State Highway No. 3E; beginning at Walla Walla on Primary State Highway No. 3, thence in a northerly direction by the most feasible route to Prescott on Secondary State Highway No. 3D, thence in an easterly direction by the most feasible route to a junction on Primary State Highway No. 3 in the vicinity northeast of Waitsburg.\\" Before and after the establishment, the route of SR 124 has gone through several documented WSDOT construction projects from 1941 to 2004. Many were small, minor projects including repavings and intersection improvements. The first was a construction project that constructed SSH 3E from SSH 3D to Waitsburg, which took place in 1941. The latest project was a realignment project along SR 124 east of Burbank. The project straightened a curve along the highway. It cost $145,589 USD and took place in 2004. A $22 million interchange with US 12 was completed in May 2012 to replace the intersection in Burbank that marks the western terminus of SR 124\\\\. The intersection, along with a nearby junction with Humorist Road that was replaced with an overpass, had been the sites of several fatal collisions that killed five people in the late 2000s. A railroad crossing south of the Ice Harbor Dam was replaced in October 2017 with an overpass that cost $11 million to construct and realigned a dangerous intersection with a nearby road.

He staged his first exhibition in 2004 basing it on what he claimed were the drawings of a disappeared schoolgirl called Naomi V. Jelish. He supported this claim with newspaper cuttings and diaries, and the work was bought for £25,000 by Charles Saatchi. Saatchi only realised the work was a hoax halfway through the exhibition when he noticed that the girl's name, and that of her teacher John Ivesmail, were both anagrams of Jamie Shovlin. It is occasionally suggested that Saatchi bought the work believing that Jelish was real. Asked about this, Shovlin replied \\"He fully knew what was going on. But the more I think about it, the more it adds another layer to the piece.\\" Commenting on the exhibition, Jamie said \\"I wouldn't call it a hoax. It's misdirection rather than tricking people. As an archetype of somebody from a difficult family, somebody like Anne Frank who did something normal in abnormal times, she has, I am sure, existed.\\" In 2006 Shovlin created another exhibition based on the memorabilia of a non-existent German glam rock band called Lustfaust. This hoax was again supported with a network of websites Shovlin had created and prompted the cultural critic Waldemar Januszczak to tell his readers how the band had \\"cocked a notorious snook at the music industry in the late 1970s by giving away their music on blank cassettes and getting their fans to design their own covers.\\" The collection (once exposed) was runner-up for the Beck's Futures prize. In September 2007 Lustfaust, together with Schneider T.M., gave a concert to help celebrate the opening of the new Berlin exhibition space for Haunch of Venison. Shovlin claims that the main function of his hoaxes was not simply to fool the audience, but rather to let them gradually realise that they were being tricked, and encourage them to question their preconceptions.

He was originally part of the band Spectrum, which also featured Richard and Karen Carpenter. He wrote the lyrics for \\"Top of the World\\", a hit for both Lynn Anderson and The Carpenters. He wrote several more hits for The Carpenters, including \\"Only Yesterday\\", \\"Goodbye to Love\\" and \\"Yesterday Once More\\". He later wrote hits for other artists such as Madonna (\\"Crazy for You\\"), Michael Jackson (\\"Human Nature\\"), The Pointer Sisters (\\"Slow Hand\\"), Diana Ross (\\"When You Tell Me That You Love Me\\"), Jennifer Warnes (\\"Nights Are Forever\\"), Peabo Bryson (\\"Can You Stop the Rain\\"), George Strait (\\"Heartland\\"), Ronnie Milsap (\\"Only One Love in My Life\\"), and Barbara Mandrell (\\"One of a Kind Pair of Fools\\"). Bettis also co-wrote, with Albert Hammond, \\"One Moment in Time\\", the 1988 Summer Olympics anthem performed by Whitney Houston and, with Steve Dorff, the theme song to the 1980s sitcom Growing Pains, \\"As Long as We Got Each Other.\\" In theatre, Bettis has provided lyrics for the musicals Lunch (tour 1994); Svengali (1992); The Last Session (L.A. Drama critics Award, Best Musical Score 1998); Say Goodnight (1999); Pure Country (2008) and most recently Josephine (2011). Bettis has nearly 800 song credits in the ASCAP database. In 2011, Bettis was inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame as well as the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.  Early life  John Bettis was born in Long Beach, California, the son of Wayne Douglas and Nellie Jane (House) Bettis. While raised in Southern California, his family's roots are in Missouri's Ozark Mountains. Bettis was introduced to country music at a very early age. Bettis began singing and playing trumpet when he was eight. In high school, he took up the guitar, was a member of the choir, and was active in theater. He attended San Pedro High School and graduated in 1964, At age 16, he auditioned and landed the lead role in a high-school production of Carousel where he first discovered the craft of songwriting. Shortly after, Bettis and his understudy formed a folk duo and began performing and touring on the folk circuit, opening for acts like Hoyt Axton, Ian & Sylvia and The Dillards. After graduation, he attended Long Beach State College. At CSULB, Bettis was writing songs for his college choir (conducted by Frank Pooler) when he met fellow student Richard Carpenter and his sister Karen. The three of them formed a band called Spectrum in 1966. In order to make money for equipment, Bettis and Richard Carpenter formed a duo with Bettis on banjo and Carpenter on piano and regularly performed a golden oldies set at Disneyland.  Songwriting career  In 1969, Richard and Karen Carpenter signed a contract with A&M; Records. Their debut Offering contained 11 songs co-written by Bettis but was not a commercial success. At the request of label owner Herb Alpert, the team recorded \\"Close to You\\", a Bacharach/David composition, in 1970 which became the Carpenters first hit with the Bettis/Carpenter-penned \\"Goodbye to Love\\" and \\"Yesterday Once More\\" finding equal success in 1972 and 1973. During this time, Bettis was spending half the year in Nashville, Tennessee, slowly getting acquainted with the songwriting community. After hearing the Carpenter/Bettis song \\"Top of the World\\", country star Lynn Anderson recorded the song, earning Bettis his first success in country music. Anderson was the first to release the song as a single and make it a hit in 1973. The success of Anderson's recording prompted the Carpenters to release their version as a single that same year. The Carpenters' version peaked at #1 for two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in December 1973. While the Carpenters rose to fame with co-written hits like \\"Only Yesterday\\", \\"I Need to Be in Love\\" and their own version of \\"Top of the World\\", Bettis continued working in Nashville. In 1978, Ronnie Milsap had a number one hit with Bettis' co-written \\"Only One Love in My Life\\". In 1981, The Pointer Sisters peaked at number two for three weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as number 7 on the R&B; chart with \\"Slow Hand\\", written by John Bettis and Michael Clark, with Conway Twitty making it a number one hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart the following year. Clark and Bettis also co-wrote Juice Newton's \\"Heart of the Night\\" and Donna Summer's \\"The Woman in Me\\". In 1983, Bettis gained his biggest achievement with \\"Human Nature\\", a ballad penned for Michael Jackson's multi-platinum album Thriller. Originally a throwaway lyric and melody snippet composed by Toto's Steve Porcaro, the entire song was later written in its entirety by Bettis and Porcaro in two days. Thriller became the best selling record of all time, and \\"Human Nature\\" has since been recorded by Boyz II Men, Miles Davis, John Mayer, George Howard, Christine Collister and David Benoit. It has also been sampled by SWV, Ne-Yo, 2Pac, Lil Wayne, Nas, Jason Nevins and Chris Brown. That same year, Barbara Mandrell's \\"One of a Kind Pair of Fools\\" reached number one on the country chart. In 1985, Bettis accepted an assignment in Hollywood to write a song for the soundtrack of the film Vision Quest. The end result was \\"Crazy for You\\", a song not originally written for, but recorded by Madonna, who also performs it in the movie. The song was an international hit, and led to the film being re-titled Crazy for You when it was released in the UK and Australia. Perhaps Bettis' best-known commissioned work is \\"As Long as We Got Each Other\\", co-written with long-time collaborator Steve Dorff as the theme song to the hit ABC Network television sitcom Growing Pains, sung by five-time Grammy winner B.J. Thomas for six seasons, solo for season 1; and, as a duet with Jennifer Warnes for seasons 2, 3, 5, and 7; and, with Dusty Springfield for season 4. In 1988, he co-wrote \\"One Moment in Time\\" with Albert Hammond which was recorded by Whitney Houston as the theme for the Summer Olympics. John Bettis continued developing an eclectic catalog into the 1990s. 1991's \\"Can You Stop the Rain\\" topped the R&B; charts in 1991 for Peabo Bryson. \\"If You Go Away\\" was a top 20 hit in 1992 for New Kids on the Block, and \\"Heartland\\", from the soundtrack to the film Pure Country, was a number one hit for George Strait.  Theater  Bettis has provided lyrics for the musicals Lunch (tour 1994); Svengali (1992); The Last Session (L.A. Drama critics Award, Best Musical Score 1998); Say Goodnight (1999); Pure Country (2008) and most recently Josephine (2011).  Awards  Bettis was nominated for the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for \\"Promise Me You'll Remember\\" from The Godfather Part III. Other nominations include: Grammy Award nominations for Best R&B; Song (\\"Can You Stop the Rain\\") and Best Song, Film and TV (\\"One Moment in Time\\", theme for the 1988 Olympics). Bettis received two Emmy Awards: \\"Where There Is Hope\\" and \\"One Moment in Time\\" and received Emmy nominations for Best Music and Lyrics (\\"Swept Away\\" and \\"As Long as We Got Each Other\\"). He was also nominated for Nashville Songwriters Association Song of the Year and Music City Song of the Year. In 2011, Bettis was inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame as well as the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Career =Youth career= Born in Malton, North Yorkshire, Dutton played for his local team Brooklyn as a child, and was invited to join the Scarborough School of Excellence. He also had a trial with Swindon Town. He joined his first senior side, Pickering Town, at the age of 16. He originally played as a Striker but was also capable of dropping back into midfield. =Cambridge United= He had just broken into Pickering's first team when he was spotted by a Cambridge United scout and was invited for a trial in November 2003. He only played for 30 minutes but was offered a contract on the spot. Here he settled into a midfield role. =Pickering Town= Dutton was released by Cambridge and returned to Pickering Town for the start of the 2004–05 season. =Weymouth= Brian Dutton was invited to go on trial with Weymouth manager Steve Johnson signing Dutton, who had decided he wanted to return to the game. He then had his contract extended for another year during which he scored the winning goal in the local derby with Dorchester Town. Dutton was offered a new contract by the club at the end of the 2005–06 season but turned it down and was released. =Eastleigh= Dutton started the 2006–07 with Eastleigh but an injury kept out of the game for three months. =Rejoining Weymouth= Dutton rejoined Weymouth in January 2007. He left at the end of the 2006–07 season and went on trial with York City. =Mangotsfield Town= He joined Mangotsfield United to keep match fitness and signed for Dorchester Town in September 2007.

At the end of the season Brian was offered an improved contract from Northwich but decided to turn it down and to rejoin his former teammate, and now manager, Darrell Clarke, at Salisbury City. =Back at Salisbury City= He left the club at the end of the season and re-joined Salisbury City under their new manager, Darrell Clarke. He became a utility player for the club, playing in a variety of places all over the pitch, before featuring on a regular basis at centre back – making the position his own. After the temporary departure of Salisbury captain Chris Giles, the Salisbury manager Darrell Clarke gave the honour of club captain to Dutton, who led Salisbury to the Conference South after a play-off final victory against Hednesford Town on penalties. He was rewarded with a new contract and club captaincy, Dutton went on to captain Salisbury to yet another promotion once again via the play offs, the final this time was against Chris Kinnear's Dover Athletic. Salisbury won the final in extra time, which meant Salisbury had earned promotion to the Conference National, the league they had been thrown out of three seasons earlier and Dutton had managed two promotions in the two seasons he was captain at the club. =Havant & Waterlooville= In June 2014, Dutton left Salisbury City to sign for Havant & Waterlooville. =Eastbourne Borough= Dutton signed for Eastbourne Borough on 6 July 2016.

South Harbour, Helsinki South Harbour (, ) is a bay and harbour area immediately next to the centre of the city of Helsinki, Finland. 4.7 million passengers in liner traffic and some 37 000 international cruise passengers travel through it every year. In addition to that, also over million tonnes of unitized cargo passes through the South Harbour. The most of the harbour's traffic is to Stockholm, Sweden and Tallinn, Estonia, and cruises. In summertime, there is also much small ship traffic. The bay is bordered by the districts of Katajanokka, Kaartinkaupunki, Ullanlinna and Kaivopuisto. The waterway leading to the South Harbour is 9.6 metres deep. The most critical point on the waterway is the Kustaanmiekka strait, with a width of 80 metres. The waterway has a speed limit of 30 km/h, except for the Katajanokka area, which has a speed limit of 10 km/h. Piers and terminals The South Harbour has eight named piers and three terminals. The Katajanokka Quay (, ) runs nearly the whole length of Katajanokka, with a length of 740 metres and water depth of 8.8 metres. The furthest part of the pier, towards the sea, consists of the cruising ship pier, with a water depth of 10.3 metres. At the middle of the pier is the Katajanokka Terminal, used by the Viking Line cruiseferries among others. At the end near the Helsinki Market Square was the Kanava Terminal (, ), used by express ships travelling to Tallinn. The terminal was pulled down in 2012. In front of the Presidential Palace is the Linnanallas (Slottsbassängen) bay, used by visiting small boats. Between the bay and the sea lies Linnanlaituri (Slottskajen), used for traffic to Korkeasaari and Porvoo. At the Market Square shore is Keisarinluodonlaituri (Kejsargrundskajen), named after an islet that the ship carrying emperor Nicholas I of Russia collided with in 1833. Nowadays the islet lies under filling ground brought to the shore. The pier is used mostly by the commuter ship to Suomenlinna. On the other side of the disused turning railway bridge is the Cholera basin, named after a seaman who died from cholera. The bay is used by fishermen and tourist ships. Next to the old market hall is the Vironallas (Estbassängen) bay, used by visiting boats. The part between Vironallas and the former railway bridge is called Lyypekinlaituri. It was formerly used by ships to Lübeck, Germany. The pier between Vironallas and the sea is called Pakkahuoneenlaituri (Packhuskajen). It is 135 metres long and has a water depth of 6.0 metres. Next is the Makasiini Terminal (, ), used by express ships to Tallinn. The Makasiini Quay pier next to it is 270 metres long and has a water depth of 7.2 to 7.5 metres. At its end is the Matkustajalaituri (Passagerkajen) pier, used by loading cruiseliners to Stockholm. The southernmost terminal is the Olympia Terminal, built for the 1952 Summer Olympics. It is used by the cruiseferries of Silja Line. The Olympia Quay pier next to it is 370 metres long and has a water depth of 7.5 to 8.8 metres. On the Valkosaari island in front of the Olympia Terminal is the home port of Nyländska jaktklubben (NJK), Helsinki's oldest yacht club, and a restaurant. In summertime, there is a regular ship connection to the island from the south side of the terminal. History Fresh fish sale in the harbour. In the 17th century, the bay was called Kaupunginlahti (Stadsviken). Its shores were so low that it was only suited for a harbour for boats owned by the inhabitants of the coast and the islands. In the 18th century, the main loading point on the bay's shore was the Erhardt pier. In the middle 18th century, the bay was called Eteläinen kaupunginsatama (Södra Stadshamnen). For long, it was a secondary harbour. As traffic increased, fastening places for ships were built on the shores and harbour warehouses for storing cargo were built. When Helsinki was made the capital of Finland, the bay's shores were filled and they were first outfitted with wooden piers, later by stone piers. The city wanted to turn its secondary harbour into a first-class one. In the early 19th century, the Market Square was founded on filled ground. A minor incident happened in 1827, when the bottom of the filled ground failed, and masses of land flowed down to the sea. The Makasiinilaituri pier also sank to the sea. Further harm to harbour visitor was caused by the shipwrecks, which could lie on the bottom of the sea for years. For long, the Ullanlinna shipyard was located at the southern part of the bay, which was renamed to Ulricaborgs skeppsvarf () in 1847. In Katajanokka, shores were being filled and built with piers and handsome cargo warehouses. The connections to the harbour improved considerably, when a railway was built there from 1891 to 1894. In 1900, a new customs house was built in Katajanokka. In the same year, the harbour was being excavated and the Eteläranta side was completed. Thus Eteläsatama got its current form. In 1922, Helsinki got the icebreaker Hercules, so that ships could also travel in winter. For transport of heavy cargo, the harbour got a 25-tonne crane in 1894. More cranes were acquired starting from the 1920s, so that in 1939, Eteläsatama already had 14 cranes. In 1936, the city council decided to expand Eteläsatama to the Helsinki shipyard. This included extensive track work to the railways, which were completed in 1952. In the same year, a pier in Katajanokka collapsed into the sea, and part of the long pier had to be closed. The car ferry era between Finland and Sweden began in the early 1960s. Cargo traffic in Katajanokka was discontinued and the railway there was dismantled in the early 1980s. Since that time, Eteläsatama has been used by passenger ships and car ferries.

The site of Marton Junction in 2009: The line to Rugby ran straight ahead, whilst the line to Weedon diverged to the right. The Rugby to Leamington Line was a railway running from Rugby to . It was a 15-mile branch line built by the London & North Western Railway (LNWR) and opened in 1851. The branch connected Leamington with the mainline from London to Birmingham (now the West Coast Main Line) which had been opened in 1838 by the LNWR's predecessor, the London & Birmingham Railway (L&BR;).  History  The original proposal for the line were promoted by the Rugby and Leamington Railway Company. The Act for the railway received Royal Assent on 13 August 1846. The line was to be built and operated by the London and Birmingham Railway, which became part of the LNWR the following year. At Rugby, the branch diverged from the main line at a junction west of Rugby railway station and ran south-west for 15 miles and eight chains to Leamington, where it was joined end-on to the LNWR's existing branch line from Coventry to Leamington, which had been extended into Leamington town centre from its original terminus at Milverton station, which had been on the edge of the town. The line from Rugby to Leamington opened throughout on 1 March 1851. The first intermediate station at Marton was opened on 1 January 1852, station opened on 1 February 1853. In February 1854, Leamington Spa Avenue station opened which was closer to the town centre than the original Milverton station, and was alongside the rival Great Western Railway's (GWR) Leamington station. The station at was opened twenty years after the opening of the line on 2 October 1871. The line was originally built as single track, but as traffic grew the line was doubled in stages from Rugby between 1882 and 1884. The lines were designated Up to Rugby and Down to Leamington. Local trains for Leamington used the down (north) end bay platforms at Rugby. At the other end of the line, services from Rugby ran through to Warwick (Milverton) and this practice continued until closure because the loco shed and servicing depot for the Rugby- Leamington-Coventry lines was at Milverton. In 1895, a new junction was created when the LNWR's single track line from Weedon to Daventry was extended westward to join the Rugby to Leamington line at Marton Junction, which was two miles southwest of Marton station in a deep cutting through a ridge of high ground. At Leamington, the LNWR used a single track connection facing Rugby to exchange goods trains with the adjacent Great Western Railway. This connection was doubled in 1908 in order to cope with the increased traffic. The local passenger service was withdrawn by British Railways in June 1959, and the local goods sidings were closed in the early 1960s, however the line continued to see use as a diversionary route by both passenger and freight trains until 1965, during the electrification of the West Coast Main Line. When this finished the line was closed as a through route on 4 April 1966, and the line closed between Marton Junction and Leamington, with the remainder of the track singled. The only remaining traffic was goods trains serving the Rugby Cement works at both Rugby and Southam, the latter of which was located on a stub of the former line to Weedon and so required trains to reverse at Marton Junction. Trains to the cement works at Southam continued until June 1985, with the track being lifted two years later. Infrequent trains served the cement works at Rugby until July 1991. The track at this end remained, and remains in place however. The former station at Birdingbury in 2010 showing the station buildings and platforms.  Route  From Rugby, the general course of the line was southwest as far as Hunningham after which it swung west for the last five miles into Leamington. Most of the route was straight and lightly graded. For the first few miles out of Rugby the line was mainly routed in shallow cuttings but west of Birdingbury it crossed the River Leam on a low viaduct. From there it ran across the flat open expanse of Marton Moor before cutting through high ground to follow the valley of the River Leam for the last few miles. The route had three civil engineering features of note: the deep cutting at Marton Junction; the lofty wrought-iron bridge spanning the cutting; and the viaduct over the canal near Radford Semele. The cutting, approximately 60 feet deep, took the line through a north-south ridge of high ground south of Hunningham. An ancient track, Ridgeway Lane, ran along the top of the ridge and met the cutting at its deepest point so the LNWR built a single-span wrought-iron trussed lattice girder bridge to carry the lane over the railway. At the time it was built (1851) this was the longest such bridge ever constructed. In later years, four lattice columns and cross- ties were added to reinforce the original structure. Known locally as 'the high bridge', this impressive example of Victorian civil engineering is still standing. Two miles further west, the handsome five-arch brick-built Offchurch Viaduct carried the route over the Grand Union Canal and adjacent low ground: the arch above the canal itself was built with skewed courses. The viaduct still stands although the trackbed across it is fenced off.  Remains  siding near Rugby is all that remains of the Rugby–Leamington railway line. At the Rugby end of the line the first half-mile of track is still in use as a siding. The rest of the line has been dismantled, and no track remains. Much of the dismantled trackbed is intact but only a few sections are public rights of way. The trackbed from Draycote (southwest of the former Dunchurch station) to Birdingbury has been surfaced by Sustrans as part of National Cycle Network Route 41. The long straight stretch of trackbed from the A423 across Marton Moor to the cutting near Hunningham is mostly clear of undergrowth and is regularly used by walkers; however, there is no legal right of way and this section can be very muddy in winter. The station houses at Dunchurch and Birdingbury are now private residences (even the platforms are still in place at Birdingbury) but there is little trace of Marton station itself and a small industrial estate occupies the site. Further west, a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) stretch of trackbed from the Fosse Way to the Grand Union Canal, titled 'Offchurch Greenway' and also part of Route 41, is well surfaced and maintained. West of the canal, the trackbed is on private land as far as the A425 road and beyond that most of the old railway has been built over. Within Royal Leamington Spa itself, the route parallels the Chiltern Main Line for approximately east of Leamington Spa railway station on a series of brick viaducts that remain in situ. However sections formerly occupied by metal-construction bridges over roads have been removed. There is no access to the viaducts, however the archways underneath are used by small businesses.

Written jointly by lead singer Philip Oakey, Keyboard players Jo Callis and Adrian Wright, it was recorded at AIR Studios between 1983–1984. Originally an album track on Hysteria, it was then released as a single in the UK.  Background  The song was conceived, written and recorded at a time when the band were under considerable pressure to provide Virgin Records with a follow up album to equal the enormous international success of Dare. The band had taken up residence in the £1,000 a day Air Studios; they were there a full year and were agonising (and arguing) over every note of every track. Dare producer Martin Rushent had already quit because of the rows and indecision causing further delays. Nick Heyward of Haircut One Hundred famously mocked the Human League in the media for taking the same time to program one drum machine as it took him to record his entire album at Air. The drum machine in question was the LinnDrum and it was being programmed for the track \\"Life on Your Own\\", a task that took two months.Human League Biography - www.League- online.com/Bio \\"Life on Your Own\\" is heavily drum machine and synthesizer led and is a return to the sound of the Human League pre-\\"Don't You Want Me\\" era. The overall sound is intentionally slow, downbeat and deliberately melancholy. It was released as a single in June 1984, and became a hit by getting into the UK top 20, reaching number 16. The lyrics were deemed \\"depressing\\" and starting with the line \\"Winter is approaching, there is snow upon the ground\\", it did not sit well with the 'happy' summer holiday records it was on sale next to. Despite this, the tune of the song is fairly upbeat in contrast to the melancholy of the lyrics. It remained in the UK charts for a further six weeks. Critically it was better appreciated and NME said \\"Life on Your Own\\" was one of Hysteria's best moments\\"Stuart Maconie, NME July 1990 It is acknowledged since, that in rushing the single out mid-summer to capitalise on Hysteria's success in the album charts was a mistake, and waiting until Christmas 1984 would have made more commercial sense for this track. Promotional video The music video for the song was filmed in London, UK in April 1984. After the 'Faux concert' scenario of \\"The Lebanon\\", The Human League returned to a themed story telling promotional video. Inspired by 1971 film The Omega Man, the video features a lonely, survivalist Oakey in the role of 'the last man on Earth', roaming deserted London landmarks haunted by the ghosts of the band's female singers Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall. Some sections of the video were shot inside the empty White City Stadium just a few months before its demolition in 1985.

His birth name was George Pinder Hattersley and he was born in Ecclesfield, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. A wicket-keeper, he played for Yorkshire from 1867 to 1880, and for the All-England Eleven from 1867 to 1871. He also umpired in some matches between 1873 and 1880. He was recognised as a fine wicket-keeper, his work to the fast bowlers - at a time when keepers \\"stood up\\" (i.e. within arm's reach of the wicket) to fast bowling - being particularly impressive. He had plenty of practice, since Tom Emmett was in the same Yorkshire side. He had to deal with Emmett's famous \\"sostenuter\\", a ball pitching on the leg stump and then breaking sharply towards the off bail. He was renowned for the slickness of his stumpings of batsmen. When Tom Hearne was stumped off a leg-shooter he exclaimed: \\"I don't call that stumping; I call it shovelling of 'em in!\\" He is believed to have been the first keeper to dispense with a long-stop, during a North v. South match in the mid or late 1870s. The idea came from his captain A. N. Hornby. Pinder was at first reluctant, but the experiment was a success. On another occasion, at The Oval, Ephraim Lockwood who was fielding long-stop said: \\"Nay, George, I've been behind thee for twenty-three overs and had nowt to stop. I'm off where there's summat [something] to do.\\" Pinder died in January 1903 in Hickleton, Yorkshire, aged 61. Bibliography * A. A.

The Parc Aberporth centre was specially developed to test and trial unmanned aircraft, for both military and civilian use.

Since the RAF left, the testing facilities at nearby Parcllyn, are operated by QinetiQ, and the old RAF camp at Blaenannerch (now recreated as ParcAberporth) is owned by the Welsh Assembly Government. Next to ParcAberporth is West Wales Airport and is owned by businessman Ray Mann, who operates West Wales Airport. ParcAberporth was created by the Welsh Development Agency, (which in 2006, merged in to the Welsh Government) to utilise the facilities and skills in the area. It has been focused as an operational test and evaluation centre for Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). One of the main difficulties in getting a wider acceptance of UAVs in civilian and commercial use has been integrating unmanned flights with existing aviation. Work at ParcAberporth and West Wales Airport has been possible as a radius around the airfield has been designated Restricted airspace - Temporary (RA(T)) up to allowing UAVs to operate without special dispensation. Since 2004, ParcAberporth is the site for an annual event of exhibition and conference devoted to the UAV industry. 2009 UAV crash In 2009 a Selex Falco UAV crashed on the site. It was under control of a pilot at the site and landed within the perimeter.

He suited up for Feyenoord Rotterdam and RBC Roosendaal in his brief career, cut short when on 7 June 1989 he was killed in the Surinam Airways Flight PY764 air crash in Paramaribo, at the age of 22. Fräser was a postman in Rotterdam and played in the youth squads of Feyenoord Rotterdam. Although he was known as a talented player and was promoted to the first team of Feyenoord in the 1987–88 season, he was an unused substitute on the bench. The next season, he was transferred to RBC Roosendaal where he made his professional debut. After that season he signed a new contract at SVV for whom he would have been playing from the 1989–90 season. He was invited by Sonny Hasnoe, the founder of the Colourful 11 to be part of the team and travel to Suriname to play in the \\"Boxel Kleurrijk Tournament\\" with three Surinamese teams. The Surinam Airways Flight PY764 crashed during approach to Paramaribo- Zanderij International Airport, killing 176 of the 187 on board, including Fräser, making it the worst ever aviation disaster in Suriname's history. Among those killed were a total of 15 members of the Colourful 11, leaving three survivors from that contingent.

There are currently 41 directly affiliated schools throughout South Africa—mainly in the areas of the former \\"Boer Republics\\" of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, educating approximately 2100 children.  Principles  The schools affiliated with the BCVO are committed to the following principles: #Teaching that the Bible is the divinely inspired and infallible Word of God and the highest authority. #Teaching conservative, Christian values in a secular world. #Teaching the Calvinist-Reformed faith and holding to all its doctrines against heresies. #Teaching Afrikaner culture and history, constantly reminding Afrikaner children of their heritage and identity.  Academics  The BCVO had an examination body, the Examination Board for Christian Education (acronym: ERCO - Afrikaans: \\"EksamenRaad vir Christelike Onderwys\\") (formerly called the \\"Onafhanklike Afrikaanse Eksamenraad\\" (OAER)), which was accredited and registered with the government institutions, including the quality controlling body, Umalusi. Accreditation was however revoked in 2012 and after reverting to the government examinations for a while, the BCVO schools in 2014 enlisted to the examinations of the Independent Examination Board, which is run independently but to government curriculum outlines and accreditation of Umalusi.  Sport  Various sports are played in BCVO schools, most notably rugby for boys and netball for girls in various age groups, from under-7 to under-19. Other sports like tennis and cricket are also played, although interest and participation in these sports are limited. The BCVO holds its annual national athletics competition during March, in which the top athletes from various schools in the different districts (Eastern Transvaal, Northwest and Central Transvaal; Limpopo, and the Orange Free State) participate. The highlight on the BCVO sporting calendar, however, is the \\"BCVO Winterspele\\" (Winter Games), held annually in June, where nearly 650 rugby players and 300 netball players participate in various age groups, representing their regions.

Retrieved June 7, 2020 August 18, 1934 – March 27, 2008) was an American professional baseball shortstop and coach, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for five different teams between and , most notably the Boston Red Sox and Washington Senators/Minnesota Twins. Primarily used in a reserve role, Consolo enjoyed his best season with the 1957 Red Sox, batting .270 in 68 games. He later served as the bench coach for the Detroit Tigers for 14 seasons, from 1979 to 1992 and again in 1995 under manager Sparky Anderson, including the Tigers' 1984 World Series title. Listed at , 180 lb., Consolo batted and threw right-handed. Career Born in Cleveland, Ohio to Italian immigrants, Consolo grew up in Los Angeles, graduating from Dorsey High School. While in high school, Consolo (along with longtime friend Anderson) played on the school's baseball team. Consolo also ran track at Dorsey and was named the Los Angeles High School Baseball city player of the year in 1951 and 1952. Consolo also played (along with Anderson) for the Crenshaw Post 715 American Legion team, winning the American Legion Baseball national title in , winning the championship at Briggs Stadium, the stadium where he coached the Detroit Tigers. Consolo went directly to the Red Sox from high school after signing in 1953 (bonus baby). Consolo joined the Red Sox at age 18; Sparky Anderson said that he was the finest athlete he had seen at that age. Consolo played for the Red Sox during six and half years. Consolo was traded to the Washington Senators on June 11, 1959, in a four- player deal that sent relief pitcher Murray Wall and Consolo to the Senators for relief pitcher Dick Hyde and infielder Herb Plews. The Twins later traded Consolo to the Milwaukee Braves on June 1, 1961 for Billy Martin and some cash. In addition to the Senators/Twins (1959–61), Consolo played for the Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Angels and Kansas City Athletics in his final 1962 season. His 1957 average of .270 was 41 points better than he hit in any other year. In a 10-season career, Consolo was a .221 hitter (260 for 1178), with nine home runs, and 83 runs batted in (RBI), in 603 games, including 158 runs, 31 doubles, 11 triples, nine stolen bases, and a .315 on- base percentage. After his playing days ended in 1962, and before his return to uniform as one of Anderson's coaches in 1979, Consolo returned to Los Angeles and like his father before him he became a barber at the old Statler Hilton Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. Consolo also worked at Los Angeles Pierce College in Woodland Hills as a sports instructor. Death Consolo died from a heart attack at the age of 73 in his Los Angeles, California home on March 27, 2008.

Goetz, \\"No Navel\\" series, around 1970. Sasha Morgenthaler (1893–1975) was a Swiss artist and dollmaker, best known for the \\"Sasha doll\\" produced in Germany and the United Kingdom beginning in the late 1960s. Popular with collectors, Sasha dolls are characterized by their individualism, their realistic expressions, their unique color, and the extreme attention to detail in the manufacture of the dolls as well as their clothes. It is said by Juliette Peers that: \\"Sasha dolls are renowned for possessing a solid intellectuality.\\" Morgenthaler created face sculpts for her dolls with subtle expressions, not artificially exaggerated smiles: her concern was that children surviving the horrors of WWII would not relate to such happy dolls in times of terror. It was said of Morgenthaler herself, as a child, that \\"When she was sad, she did not like her dolls uncompromising smiles. Once she grabbed a nail file and scraped off her doll's false grin...\\" In her own words, \\"No grotesque caricature can awaken a child's true feelings. A piece of wood, barely carved, is far superior to a conventional doll with an exaggerated smile.\\" Background Sasha Morgenthaler was an artist working most often in sculpture and paint; her early life was enriched by visits to the von Sinner family home from great artists such as Paul Klee, who supervised her artistic education and introduced Morgenthaler to members of the Der Blaue Reiter such as Wassily Kandinsky. Paul Klee orchestrated Morgenthaler's entry to the School of Fine Arts at Geneva. Morgenthaler married fellow artist Ernst Morgenthaler. Morgenthaler decided in the 1960s to mass-produce dolls at reasonable prices after years of making dolls herself for the studio, on commission, and for private individuals. Two companies were licensed to produce the dolls: Götz in Germany and Frido (later Trendon) in the UK. Production in Germany ran from 1965 to 1969 and from 1995 to 2001, while the UK production ran from 1966 to 1986. Dolls were produced in different styles, wearing different clothes, and with subtle variations (mostly in painting) that individualize and particularize each. Asymmetrical and made of hard vinyl with elastic stringing enabling them to take poses, Sasha dolls are characterized by a serious, open expression that seems to make them more adaptable to imaginative play than if they were forever smiling. Morgenthaler's original idea was for the dolls to represent an image of universal childhood, so from the beginning of mass- production, the vinyl was coffee-coloured so that they would not appear to belong to any one ethnic group. In the early 1970s, black dolls were introduced, first in an extremely dark complexion, then in a lighter complexion in the latter part of the decade. Around 1980, the \\"skin\\" tone of most of the \\"Caucasian\\" dolls was lightened. Dolls come in girl, boy, baby, and (beginning in the last production cycle) toddler versions. Girl and boy dolls are 16 inches or so tall, while babies and toddlers are 11-12 inches. Babies have curved arms and legs and do not stand. When first introduced, baby dolls were sexed with stylised genitals, but the practice was discontinued. Dolls have rooted hair in brown, blonde, red, or black, though some \\"limited edition\\" dolls had wigs. Clothes sets were available, though some clothes came only with the purchase of a doll and were not available separately. The generic name for the dolls is \\"Sasha\\" after their creator. Some dolls have their own names, however. During the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, \\"Caucasian\\" boy dolls were known as \\"Gregor\\", black girl dolls were known as \\"Cora\\", and black boy dolls were known as \\"Caleb\\". When production resumed in 1995, many of the dolls were given individual names by the manufacturer, but all are still identified by the collective name of \\"Sasha\\". Now that production has ceased, the dolls are becoming more and more collectible. The rarest ones can fetch high prices on auction sites such as eBay and from individual dealers. Various generations of Morgenthaler's Sasha dolls are available for viewing at the Puppenmuseum Sasha Morgenthaler in Switzerland. Here visitors may also view related archival holdings and other works of art by Morgenthaler.  References  Further reading * Doggart, A., Doggart, J., & Friedland, S. (2018).

The project is now defunct. It was a 50:50 joint venture between Optus and Elders. Broadband Connect Funding In June 2006, the Australian Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (DCITA) under the then coalition government called for expressions of interest for discussion of how to invest up to A$878 million in funding under Broadband Connect program to provide greater access to broadband services in rural and regional areas at prices comparable to services available in metropolitan areas, $500 million of which was envisaged as being available to infrastructure projects. On 2006-09-21, the government announced they would invest up to $600 million in broadband infrastructure projects in rural, regional and remote Australia under this program. Applications for funding were open until 2006-11-30. On 2007-06-18, in the lead up to a federal election, OPEL Networks was announced as the sole successful bidder, receiving the entire $600 million in funding under the program, as well as an additional allocation of $358 million. This was to be combined with $917 million to be invested by the OPEL Networks joint venture. The awarding of additional funding was met with some debate. The funding agreement was signed on 2007-09-09, which was dependent upon further planning by OPEL and confirmation that it would reach the agreed levels of coverage. The then federal opposition Communications spokesman stated that they would honour the agreement, a stance maintained after winning government two months later, despite their own competing National Broadband Network proposal. On 2008-04-02, it was announced that the funding agreement had been cancelled. The minister cited OPEL's failure to meet the terms of the contract, specifically that analysis of OPEL's detailed maps revealed that it would reach only 72% of under-served premises, a claim refuted by the OPEL joint venture partners, who nevertheless stated that the project would not proceed. Network Infrastructure The OPEL Networks rollout was to include: * 1,361 WiMAX sites across all states as well as the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory * 312 DSLAMs across all states * 114 DSLAMs to be built and owned by Optus and made available to OPEL, across all states excluding Tasmania, but including the ACT. * 2,400 km of new fibre-optic backhaul, including a new undersea link to Tasmania The venture was also to acquire long term leased links from Optus (10,200 km) and other providers such as Nextgen Networks (2,200 km), as well as establishing a Tasmanian link using Basslink, providing OPEL with a protected link to the island. The selection of WiMAX technology was questioned by some groups, including the then Federal Opposition and competitor Telstra, leading to further debate. On 2008-01-07, OPEL acquired spectrum licences from Austar, conditional upon approval of its funding agreement, enabling it to deploy WiMAX using licensed spectrum rather than using unlicensed spectrum as previously planned. Operation While Optus was to be contracted to build the network, OPEL Networks was to operate its network on behalf of its owners Optus and Elders, offering wholesale services back to them as customers, as well as to other third-party broadband retailers. Elders intended to enter the telecommunications market by selling OPEL services from its existing retail channels.

Hoke escapes thanks to the aid of three fellow 'ABneg' survivors – two women and a German navigator, shot down over Britain long ago. Hoke, being used to three years alone, detests his saviours and, corrupted by propaganda, is almost unable to contain himself in the presence of the German even though the war has long since ended. Disease With the V-2 missiles came two types of the same disease. First is the Blood Death which kills the subject instantly in a gruesome way. The arteries become blocked and explode, the skin splits and blood pours from every orifice. The Slow Death has the same climax but takes longer to work, up to years, and weakens the subject, blackens their fingers and hands and bruises their body internally. Victims of the Slow Death are generally much weaker and slower to react than the AB negs, however some individuals (such as McGruder, Hubble's bodyguard) seem less prone to its debilitating effects.  Characters  * Eugene Nathaniel Hoke is an American pilot who volunteered for the war before America itself did. He is a loner at heart, likes to fend for himself and is affected grossly by military propaganda against the Germans as shown by his attitude to a fellow survivor. * Cagney is a dog who formed a strong alliance with Hoke after Hoke saved his life and fed him. Cagney acts as a guard dog but also knows when to retreat from extreme danger. It is often Cagney who warns Hoke of approaching danger with a low growl or change in mood. * Wilhelm Stern is a German navigator apparently shot down and imprisoned at Island Farm POW camp in Wales. He claims this is his only experience of the war and constantly tries to neutralize Hoke from the propaganda. It is later revealed that Stern was a German spy during the war. His plane crashed in 1944, but he managed to escape the blaze. * Cissie is a poor girl of Cockney descent who befriended Muriel in a medical research hospital after the V-2 missiles struck. After many of the doctors fell dead of the Blood Death and hope of a cure faded, Cissie ran away with Muriel. Cissie is described as slightly rounder than Muriel but more Hoke's taste. However, her foul language shocks Hoke on more than one occasion. * Muriel Drake is a rich girl who contrasts with Cissie in background but share a strong bond from when they met. She is described as more beautiful than Cissie and claims to feel spiritual presence several times suggesting that she has medium properties in her. It later transpires that she has been allied with the Blackshirts all along, due to a friendship between Hubble and her deceased father. * Albert Potter, an old air raid warden who has been carrying on his duties even after the Blood Death and seems to not realize the war is over. He is described as slightly insane but harmless and loves to talk of himself and his achievements proudly. *Lord Hubble, a victim of the Slow Death and tries desperately to capture Hoke, believing the pilot is the only Blood Death survivor, so that he can perform a foolish blood transfusion in hope that he can live on, free of the Slow Death. He is the leader of the Blackshirts, all who seem intent on following him to the grave. Hubble is also said to have ties with Hitler during the war.

It was founded as the capital of the remnant of the historic Oyo empire in the 1830s, and is known to its people as 'New Oyo' (Ọ̀yọ́ Àtìbà) to distinguish it from the former capital to the north, 'Old Oyo' (Ọ̀yọ́-Ilé), which had been deserted as a result of the Yoruba Revolutionary Wars. Its inhabitants are mostly of the Yoruba people, and its ruler is the Alaafin of Oyo. History Due to the dominant position that the Oyo empire had in medieval West Africa, the members of the Oyo clan of the Yoruba people were commonly thought of as being the tribe's ruling elite. This was true to such an extent, in fact, that the Yoruba historian Samuel Johnson reported that the Egbas - who began as an Ọ̀yọ́ offshoot - once determined social rank within their clan by way of whether or not an Egba could trace his or her descent back to Oyo. Education Oyo is home to five higher institutions; these are the Federal College of Education, Awe, Ajayi Crowther University, Emmanuel Alayande College of Education (Main and Satellite Campus), Federal School of Surveying, and Atiba University. It houses numerous public and private secondary schools such as Olivet Baptist High School, Saint Benardine Girls Grammar School, Ladigbolu Grammar School, Oranyan Grammar School, Emmanuel Alayande Model High School, Aatan Baptist Comprehensive High School, Nesto College, SPED International College etc. There are numerous primary schools both private and public with new crop of alleged \\"mushroom\\" private schools. Commerce The major markets in the city include the Akesan market, the Ajegunle market, the Owode market, the Saabo market, Oparinde (Oja-Oke) market and the Irepo market. Oyo houses branches of different banks such as GT Bank(Owode), First bank, Zenith Bank, Access Bank, Eco Bank, United Bank for Africa etc and some other microfinance banks and cooperatives. It also has grocery stores and supermarkets such as the Ace Supermarket and Stores, Joba Pharmacy and Stores, Labake Stores etc. The city is the home of many hangout spots such as the Old Oyo National Park which contains a museum(holding artifacts from the ancient Òyó Empire) and a few animals. Some hotels in Oyo include Labamba Hotel, Tees resort and bar, Begonia hotel, Adesh Hotel, Gold N Rock Hotel, Galaxy Hotel etc. Local governance and location The city has four LGAs viz: Atiba LGA, headquartered at Offa-Meta; Oyo East LGA, headquartered at Kosobo; Oyo West LGA, headquartered at Ojongbodu and Afijio LGA, headquartered at Jobele.

It runs between North Africa bordered by the Mediterranean Sea in the north and West Africa bordered by the Atlantic Ocean in the south, from Algiers in Algeria to Lagos in Nigeria, giving it the alternative names of the Algiers-Lagos Highway or Lagos-Algiers Highway. The Trans-Sahara Highway is one of the oldest transnational highways in Africa and one of the most complete, having been proposed in 1962, with construction of sections in the Sahara starting in the 1970s. Its central section is still little-used though, and still requires special vehicles and precautions to be taken to survive the harsh environment and climate of the center of the desert. Route and status =Overall features, length and condition= Trans-Sahara Highway near Tamanrasset in AlgeriaThe Trans-Sahara Highway https://sahara-overland.com/routes/has a length of about 4,500 km of which about 85% has been paved. It passes through only three countries, since Algeria and Nigeria are separated by Niger alone. However, an additional 3,600 km of linked highways to Tunisia, Mali and Chad are considered by planners to be integral to the Trans-Sahara Highway. All the 1,200 km of the highway lying in Nigeria is part of that country's national paved road network and includes nearly 500 km of four-lane divided sections, but highway maintenance is frequently deficient in Nigeria and at times parts of the road may be in poor condition, including having lost the pavement. About half the highway, over 2,300 km, lies in Algeria but particularly south of In Salah much of it is in poor condition, prone to flooding run-off from the Hoggar Mountains and is constantly being repaired. In 2007 the southern half of the 400 km from Tamanrasset to In Guezzam on the Niger border has been sealed. Although work continues, the rest is sand. Niger has 985 km of the highway of which 785 km is paved but also in poor condition. Further details are given below. Another crossing of the Sahara is proposed for the Tripoli- Cape Town Highway (Trans-African Highway 3) but this route requires a great deal more construction, faces problems of instability and lawlessness in northern Chad, and is not likely to stimulate trade to the same extent as TAH 2. Consequently, it may be decades away from completion. Two other Trans- African Highways cross the Sahara, but at its edges. In 2005 the Cairo-Dakar Highway (TAH 1) in the west along the Atlantic coast became the first fully sealed highway crossing the Sahara from north to south (barring a few kilometres in No Man's Land between Morocco/Western Sahara and Mauritania). The Cairo-Cape Town Highway (TAH 5) follows the Nile in the east, but has long unpaved sections in Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya. Announced in 2018http://adrar- info.net/?p=42317, by 2019 a third trade route opened up between Algeria and Mauritania, but has yet to be classified. Established during the French colonial era as a link between Algiers with Dakar to avoid the then Spanish Sahara on the Atlantic, it was closed in 1963. Currently tarmac ends on the Algerian border just south of Tindouf and resumes some 900-kilometres later at Zouerat, passing via Bir Moghrein.https://sahara-overland.com/mauritania/ Route Roadway in the Algerian Sahara.

The United College comprises all members of the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region, except the Secretaries of State. The United College is presided over by the Minister-President of the Brussels Region, who only has an advisory vote. As a result, there are two French- speaking and two Flemish members with the right to vote. The United Assembly can legislate by ordinance.

Most of our knowledge about his career and his demise comes from Livy's Ab Urbe Condita. Biography Albinus was a member of the patrician gens Postumia, and the son of Aulus Postumius Albinus, who was a consul in 242 BC.Smith, pg. 91 He was elected as a consul for the first time in 234 BC, during which he campaigned against the Ligures.Broughton, pgs. 223-224 It has been conjectured that he was then elected Praetor for the first time in the following year (233 BC).Broughton, pg. 225 Albinus was then elected as a consul for a second time in 229 BC, during which he and his consular colleague Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus were engaged in a war against the Illyrian queen Teuta.Eutropius, iii. 4Orosius, iv. 13Polybius, ii. 11 ff., who erroneously calls him \\"Aulus\\" instead of \\"Lucius\\" Albinus commanded the land forces, and gained a number of significant victories during the year. He captured Apollonia and then went to the relief of Epidamnos and Issa, forcing the Illyrians to abandon both sieges. He also managed to subdue a number of local Illyrian tribes before returning to Epidamnos. Albinus was granted a pro-consular extension to his command in 228 BC, after his term ended, in order to conclude the peace treaty with the Illyrians.Broughton, pg. 228 Once it had been concluded, he sent legates to the Aetolian and Achaean Leagues, where they explained the reasons for the war and the Roman invasion, as well as the terms of the treaty with Queen Teuta. On his return to Rome, unlike his comrade, he was not granted a triumph to celebrate his victory.Pol. 2,11,1-12,8. Albinus disappears from the historical record during the next decade, but resurfaced in 216 BC, with the Second Punic War in full swing. The Romans, finding themselves short of experienced military commanders, were forced to recall men such as Albinus to serve during this period of crisis.Livy, 22:35 Consequently, Albinus, who was not even in Rome for the election, was elected praetor for the second time,Broughton, pg. 249 and given command of the province of Gallia Cisalpina. He led his army of two legions plus reinforcements against the Celtic Boii, who had risen in revolt and declared for Hannibal. The death of the Roman General Postumius at the hands of the Boii During his term as a praetor, he was elected in absentia (and whilst on campaign) as a consul for the year 215. However, he did not live to officially enter the consulship.Broughton, pg. 253 While travelling through the Litana forest in Gallia Cisalpina, Albinus was ambushed by a force of Boii warriors, who annihilated most of his army at the Battle of Silva Litana. Albinus and the remainder of his legions tried to escape over a nearby bridge, but they were slaughtered by a Boii detachment that guarded the crossing. The consul-elect was decapitated, and his skull was then clad in gold and made into a sacrificial bowl.Polybius, iii. 106, 118Cicero, Tusculanae Quaestiones i. 37 As Livy tells us: When news of Albinus’ death reached Rome, it caused such an alarm that the shops were closed and hardly anyone ventured out of their homes. The Senate ordered the aediles to go around the city and order the citizens to re-open their shops and stop the unofficial public mourning.Livy, 23:25 Albinus’ replacement as consul was Marcus Claudius Marcellus.

History The church was built by St. Ambrose starting from 382 on the road that connected Milan (then Mediolanum) to Rome. It was originally dedicated to the Apostles, and thus known as Basilica Apostolorum. Overview As explained by an inscription in the church written by Ambrose himself, the church's plan was on the Greek Cross with apses on the arms, a feature present only in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. In front of the basilica was a porticoed atrium. Under the basilica's altar were housed the relics of the Apostles, which are still present. In 397, when the body of St. Nazarus was discovered, a new apse was created. Serena, niece of emperor Theodosius I, donated the marbles for the sacellum housing the relics and also embellished the rest of the church. The apse of the right arm has a portal with a false porch. The ceiling of the nave, originally consisting of wooden spans, was replaced by a groin vault during the Middle Ages. The walls are original. Also in this age the Romanesque-style octagonal tambour, featuring a circular loggia with small columns, was added over the arms' crossing. Starting from 1512, Bramantino built the Trivulzio Mausoleum, which obstructs the Palaeo- Christian façade.

The St. Johns culture was present along the St. Johns River and its tributaries (including the Oklawaha River, and along the Atlantic coast of Florida from the mouth of the St. Johns River south to a point east of the head of the St. Johns River, near present-day Cocoa Beach, Florida. At the time of first European contact, the St. Johns culture area was inhabited by speakers of the Mocama (or Agua Salada), Agua Fresca and Acuera dialects of the Timucua language and by the Mayacas.Milanich.

At - Retrieved July 14, 2007 Defining characters and environment The St. Johns culture is defined in terms of pottery styles. Plain chalky ware was the dominant St. Johns ceramic type. (\\"Chalky\\" ware was made from clay taken from fresh water sources, which contained spicules from fresh water sponges. The spicules in the clay helped strengthen the pottery, and created a \\"chalky\\" surface, soft enough to be scratched with a fingernail.)Pelotes Island Nature Preserve - Woodland Period - St. Johns Cultures - 500 BC to 1500 AD - Retrieved July 17, 2007 \\"Exotic\\" ceramic ware is common, especially in ceremonial contexts. These \\"exotic\\" ceramics represent types from the Deptford, Glades, Belle Glade, Swift Creek, Weeden Island, Savannah, Safety Harbor, and Fort Walton cultures. There was a transitional area from the mouth of the St. Johns River extending into southeastern Georgia where St. Johns ware overlapped with Savannah ware, and another transitional area, the Indian River region (southern Brevard County, and Indian River and St. Lucie counties), where St. Johns ware overlapped with Belle Glade and Glades ware.Milanich. P. 46 The St. Johns culture was based on the exploitation of marine and fresh water resources. Villages and camps were located close to rivers, lakes, wetlands, coastal lagoons and estuaries. During the 2000 years of the St. Johns culture, large middens of shell and other debris, sometimes covering several acres and often up to high, accumulated throughout the region (Turtle Mound, near New Smyrna Beach, Florida, was estimated to be high before it was reduced by shellrock mining in the 19th and 20th centuries).Milanich. P. 38-9 Some existing mounds extend for as long as a half-mile along the banks of the St. Johns River. Diet and resources The people of the St. Johns culture, such as these Timucuans pictured in 1562 by Jacques Le Moyne, obtained much of their food from the water. While oyster, clam and mussel shells dominate the middens, bones found in the middens indicate that catfish were a much larger component of the St. Johns people's diet than were shellfish.Milanich. P. 40 The St. Johns diet consisted of a wide variety of fish, shellfish, reptiles, mammals and birds. Investigation of a site at Hontoon Island indicated that fresh water snails, fish and turtles provided most of the meat consumed at the site, and that those resources were exploited year-round. Plant foods included berries, nuts, cabbage palm, amaranth, and various small plants, especially those growing in wetlands. Gourds were grown, but probably used as containers.Milanich. P.42 Maize cultivation reached the Timucua speakers of the St. Johns culture area around 750, although some authorities think the arrival was as late as 1050. The southernmost part of the St. Johns culture area (the Mayacas) had not acquired maize cultivation at the time of first European contact. The St. Johns peoples were not as dependent on maize cultivation as were most cultures in the southeastern United States, as suitable soil for sustainable maize production was scarce in the wetlands favored for habitation, and abundant wetland resources were available year-round.Milanich. P. 44-5Volusia County Heritage - People of the Shell Mounds: the Earliest Volusians - How They Lived - Retrieved July 17, 2007 Except along the western fringes of the region, the only stone resources available were soft coquina and sandstone, which were used for grinding and abrading tools. Tools and implements were more often made of bone and shell, than of stone. Stone artifacts (usually made of chert) in the St. Johns culture are a mixture of styles preserved from the Archaic period with styles representative of neighboring cultures. Wooden artifacts that were preserved in water and wet soils have also been found. Mounds Purpose-built mounds of sand (as opposed to shell middens) first appeared in the St. Johns culture region around 100 CE. As was common throughout Florida, mounds were used for burials. Some bodies were buried intact, in a flexed position, but most were first placed in charnel houses, which were often built on top of a mound. The flesh was removed from, or allowed to rot off of, the bones, and the bones were cleaned. Eventually the accumulated long bones and skulls of each individual were bundled and then buried in a group in the mound. The charnel house would then be destroyed, often by fire. A new layer of sand might then be added to the mound, and a new charnel house build on the top.Milanich. Pp. 48-9 The early mounds in the St. Johns culture region were generally high up to an occasional . The number of burials in a mound might be as high as 100, but most held fewer than 25. After 1050 influence from the Mississippian culture led some groups to construct platform mounds, which may have been topped by temples and/or chiefs' residences. One of these mounds, the Shields Mound in Duval County, eventually reached along each side of the base, and held 150 burials. Another mound, Mt. Royal Mound, just north of Lake George, which was high and in diameter, was primarily a burial mound. This mound also contained many items apparently received as trade goods from the region of the Mississippian culture. Chiefdoms in the St. Johns culture region did not achieve the size and power of those to the west, from the Florida panhandle through to the Mississippi valley, and large platform mounds were rare in the St. Johns region.Milanich.

After training in the art of miniature painting with the Capuchin monk-painter Ippolito Galantini (1627-1706) and pastels with the noted Domenico Tempesti (c.1655-1737), she polished her skills with Anton Domenico Gabbiani. Fratellini was accepted into Florence's Accademia del disegno in 1706 and elevated to full member in 1710.  Portraiture and commissions  Her portrait works were the means to her success and her sitters were considered the epitome of eightieth-century refinement.\\"Pastels by Giovanna Fratellini.\\" AWAF. N.p., n.d. Web. 28 Jan. 2014. <>. Her works depicted a model of both noble and virtuous eightieth-century refinement. Fratellini's depiction of Ceilia Pazzi (1720), part of her ‘child lady’ series, honors the young girls of noble birth in adult poses and adult features and characteristics. In addition to portraits, Fratellini is documented as a religious painter for Cosimo III. Prince Ferndinando commissioned several history and mythological pieces in pastel. Her commissioned works were invoiced and recorded as having received up to 15 scudi for each completed portrait in pastel on paper. Violante Beatrix Von Bayern, governor of Siena and wife of Tuscany's hereditary prince Ferninando de’ Medici commissioned her to portray many of the ladies at the court. Fratellini accepted the task to commemorate the prominent circle of courtly ladies. Violante Beatrix sent Fratellini to Bologna to portray Maria Klementyna Sobieska, the wife of the exiled James Francis Edward Stuart. James Stuart later requested portraits of his sons. Following her stay in Bologna she traveled to Venice to portray Violanta Beatrix's sister-in-law, Teresa Kunigunda Sobieska (1676-1730) and Maria Klementyna's aunt. Fratellini is frequently compared to the Venetian Painter Rosalba Carriera (1675-1757). During her stay in Venice, she met Rosalba Carriera. Fratellini is noted as having great admiration for Carriera, who also extended her “gentillissime accoglienze,” or kind hospitality. Villa Petraia, a Medici villa that became the residence to the King of Italy during Florence's brief time as the Italian capital city during 1870 is located outside of Florence and is the home to some of Fratellini's best known works in pastel. Also many of her works are pending restoration or maintenance and can be found in the Uffizi’s deposits. A large number of her pastels that were commissioned by the Medici family are located there in the Uffizi’s portrait collection.  Teacher and mentor  The Tuscan artists welcomed her. Throughout Fratellini’s lifetime she shared her artistic expertise with several female painters, most notably, Maria Maddalena Gozzi Baldacci and Violante Beatrice Siries Cerroti, a Florentine painter who was named after the patroness and princess. Violante Beatrice Siries took Fratellini’s place as court painter after her death.  Self-Portrait  Fratellini’s self-portrait, depicting herself in the act of painting, “Self Portrait”, 1720 is in the Uffizi Gallery. It is displayed in the Vasari Corridor. Although she is shown holding oil paints and working on a miniature portrait painting, the work is completed in pastel. She portrays herself as an attractive and lively middle- aged woman. She is seen with energy and charm.Greer, Germaine. The Obstacle Race: The Fortunes of Women Painters and Their Work. New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1979. Print.

Sahakian was the founder of Uni-Mart, which quickly became one of the largest convenience store and gasoline station chains in the United States. A Christian Armenian from Iran who moved to the United States in 1956, he studied mechanical engineering at Pennsylvania State University. There, he founded Unico, a builder of student housing projects. The venture was a success, but Sahakian sought new challenges and, noting the rapid growth of Southland Corporation's 7-Eleven convenience stores throughout the region, flew to the chain's Dallas headquarters to personally petition for an exclusive territory of stores. When Southland offered him only a single store, Sahakian turned to Munford, Inc., the Atlanta-based owners of the Ma-jik Market convenience store chain, which granted him a 20-year license for convenience stores in the state of Pennsylvania. Sahakian opened several Ma- jik Market stores in Central Pennsylvania in the early 1970s and by 1980 was operating 90 stores in the state. In 1981, he severed his relationship with the Maj-jik Market chain and rebranded his stores as Uni-Mart. His convenience store chain continued to rapidly expand in the Mid-Atlantic region and eventually grew to nearly 300 stores at its peak. In addition to housing development and convenience store businesses, Sahakian and his family have also owned hotel and automotive oil change specialty shop franchises in the State College, Pennsylvania area. Philanthropy Henry Sahakian, and his wife Seda, established the Henry D. Sahakian Family Fund to help offer financial support to various Centre County, Pennsylvania charitable organizations.

It is the sequel to the earlier Shadow of the Beast. Plot and gameplay Shadow of the Beast II (Amiga) Shadow of the Beast II finds the hero Aarbron in half-beast form, wandering the lands of Karamoon in search of his kidnapped sister. She had been taken away from her mother's cottage by the dragon-form of the Beast Mage, Zelek, servant to Maletoth. Along the way, Aarbron befriends the wise dragon Barloom and must defeat the evil dragon Ishran. Tree Pygmies in the forest and the goblins in the Crystal Caverns serve as foes. Production As in the first game, the cover art for Shadow of the Beast II was created by Roger Dean and the game was packaged with a promotional black T-shirt that featured Dean's artwork. The music for Beast 2 & 3 was composed and produced by Tim Wright. These titles featured a more extensive soundtrack and utilised ethnic samples taken from among other sources the same Korg M1 synthesizer that was sampled by David Whittaker for the original game (although in this case, it was the rack- mounted version the Korg M1/R). Beast 2 contained a total of 17 tracks, most notable of which are the title theme and the game over theme, both of which feature real sampled electric guitars. Ports Shadow of the Beast II was ported to the Atari ST and FM-Towns computers, as well as the Mega Drive and Mega-CD platforms. The Mega-CD version had drastic changes made to it, the most noticeable being a new soundtrack complete with voice acted dialogue sequences and added FMVs. The in-game graphics were also slightly enhanced, and some areas of the game were redesigned to be less difficult than the original.  Reception  Shadow of the Beast and Shadow of the Beast II were reviewed in 1991 in Dragon where both games received ratings of 5 out of 5 stars. A reviewer for Next Generation gave the Sega CD version one out of five stars, saying that the game had been good at the time of its release on the Amiga four years before, but was now horribly outdated: \\"Even though the designers tried to spruce it up by adding better music, digitized speech, and a few rendered cut scenes, it still doesn't help much considering the game's overall stilted animation and poor control.\\"  References   External links   Shadow of the Beast II at Hall of Light Category:1990 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:Dark fantasy video games Category:FM Towns games Category:Sega Genesis games The Shadow of the Beast 2 Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Single-player video games Category:Platform games Category:Psygnosis games Category:Creative Assembly games Category:Video games scored by Tim Wright Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Shadow of the Beast II"},{"id":"12250080","text":"Novacaine was an American rock music group, formed in 1996 in Santa Monica, California, United States.

Published in 1938 by C. R. C. Allberry,Allberry, C. R. C., editor & translator, with a contribution by Hugo Ibscher, Coptic Manichaean Psalm-book part II, W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart, 1938. The Psalms of Thomas occupy pages 203-227. Internet versions only comprise 12 numbered psalms. The themes and content of the psalms bear a considerable resemblance to the Hymn of the Pearl from the Acts of Thomas. In 1949 Torgny Save-Soderbergh suggested that the psalms were largely based upon canonical Mandaean texts (despite Jesus being mentioned positively in two psalms), his work on the psalms demonstrating that Mandaeism did not derive from Manichaeism, as was formerly commonly believed.Save-Soderbergh, Torgny, Studies in the Coptic Manichaean Psalm-book, 1949. Nevertheless, considerable controversy continues as to whether the Thomas or Thom referred to could be the Apostle Thomas, Mani's disciple, also called Thomas, or the Gnostic concept of the divine twin. This is because the latter is referred to in other parts of the Coptic Manichaean Psalm-book as a distinct person from the Apostle. The enigma has since deepened with the publication of the Cologne Mani Codex in the 1970s, which showed that Mani himself came out of a baptizing Christian sect called the Elkasaites (= Elcesaites).

The officially recognised date for the formation of the society is 30 November 1892, making it the first professional dance organization of its kind in the United Kingdom, and the second oldest in the world.The American Society of Teachers of Dancing was organized in 1879 and incorporated in 1883. Richardson P.J.S. 1960. The social dances of the nineteenth century in England. Jenkins, London. p121  History of the BATD  Founded in 1892, the BATD became the first UK dance association of its kind to encourage the organisation of dance professionals into an organised society. The association may have been in operation earlier than this, however 30 November 1892 is the first recorded date that can be established beyond doubt (see BATD website). There were 24 founder members recorded in 1892, with an estimated 3,500 members registered by the year 1999. The British Association is represented in the following countries: * United Kingdom * Malta * Canada * United States of America * Australia * South Africa * Spain * France * Italy * Netherlands * Germany * Belarus * Latvia * South Korea The BATD is represented in many other countries, but this list shows those countries where there are a notable number of registered members or where regular meetings of the association are held.  Configuration of the Society  The Society is managed by a President, Vice-Presidents, Trustees Treasurer and an Executive Council. These are all elected positions, which are balloted at the societies annual conference. There are various other regional or district committees, which organize meetings, lectures, seminars and other events for the membership in their district. These positions are nominated and elected by the membership of each district and include a Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Secretary, Treasurer and Marshall. Members of the society can seek higher office, first at regional level then at the Executive level. Diane Barron was the president of the Association from 2001 to 2005.Diane Barron  Branches  The primary work of the society is to provide examination syllabi in various dance styles. There are a number of branches within the society that each specialise in a specific dance subject. They are: * Tap * Stage (known as Theatre or Stage Craft in other organisations) * Ballet * Highland * Modern Dance * Jazz * Acrobatic Dance * Hornpipe * Jig * Traditional Step Dancing * European National Ballroom * Latin American * Classical * Disco * Rock'n'Roll * Country and Western * Scottish Country Dance * Dance Exercise * Scottish National Dance * Majorette * Dance and Drama * Special Needs Awards A range of examinations and awards are available in each dance discipline for children of all ages. These are typically organized into grades or medal tests, with the work being assessed by a BATD registered examiner. As well as these examinations for children, the society also offers training for adults and teacher training for dance professionals who wish to become a registered teacher with the BATD.

It can result from physical trauma or from hemorrhagic stroke. 30% of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) are primary, confined to the ventricular system and typically caused by intraventricular trauma, aneurysm, vascular malformations, or tumors, particularly of the choroid plexus. However 70% of IVH are secondary in nature, resulting from an expansion of an existing intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage has been found to occur in 35% of moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries. Thus the hemorrhage usually does not occur without extensive associated damage, and so the outcome is rarely good.Dawodu S. 2007. \\"Traumatic Brain Injury: Definition, Epidemiology, Pathophysiology\\" Emedicine.com. Retrieved on June 19, 2007.Vinas FC and Pilitsis J. 2006. \\"Penetrating Head Trauma.\\" Emedicine.com.  Symptoms and diagnosis  Symptoms of IVH are similar to other intracerebral hemorrhages and include sudden onset of headache, nausea and vomiting, together with an alteration of the mental state and/or level of consciousness. Focal neurological signs are either minimal or absent, but focal and/or generalized seizures may occur. Xanthochromia, yellow-tinged CSF, is the rule. Diagnosis can be confirmed by the presence of blood inside the ventricles on CT. =Associated conditions= Brain contusions and subarachnoid hemorrhages are commonly associated with IVH. The bleeding can involve the anterior communicating artery or the posterior communicating artery. In both adults and infants, IVH can cause dangerous increases in ICP, damage to the brain tissue, and hydrocephalus.  Treatment  Treatment focuses on monitoring and should be accomplished with inpatient floor service for individuals responsive to commands or neurological ICU observation for those with impaired levels of consciousness. Extra attention should be placed on intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring via an intraventricular catheter and medications to maintain ICP, blood pressure, and coagulation. In more severe cases an external ventricular drain may be required to maintain ICP and evacuate the hemorrhage, and in extreme cases an open craniotomy may be required. In cases of unilateral IVH with small intraparenchymal hemorrhage the combined method of stereotaxy and open craniotomy has produced promising results.  Prognosis  Prognosis is also very poor when IVH results from intracerebral hemorrhage related to high blood pressure and is even worse when hydrocephalus follows. It can result in dangerous increases in ICP and can cause potentially fatal brain herniation. Even independently, IVH can cause morbidity and mortality. First, intraventricular blood can lead to a clot in the CSF conduits blocking its flow and leading to obstructive hydrocephalus which may quickly result in increased intracranial pressure and death. Second, the breakdown products from the blood clot may generate an inflammatory response that damages the arachnoid granulations, inhibiting the regular reabsorption of CSF and resulting in permanent communicating hydrocephalus. Babies IVH in the preterm brain usually arises from the germinal matrix whereas IVH in the term infants originates from the choroid plexus. However, it is particularly common in premature infants or those of very low birth weight.Annibale DJ and Hill J. 2006. Periventricular Hemorrhage- Intraventricular Hemorrhage. Emedicine.com. Retrieved on June 19, 2007. The cause of IVH in premature infants, unlike that in older infants, children or adults, is rarely due to trauma. Instead it is thought to result from changes in perfusion of the delicate cellular structures that are present in the growing brain, augmented by the immaturity of the cerebral circulatory system, which is especially vulnerable to hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The lack of blood flow results in cell death and subsequent breakdown of the blood vessel walls, leading to bleeding. While this bleeding can result in further injury, it is itself a marker for injury that has already occurred. Most intraventricular hemorrhages occur in the first 72 hours after birth. The risk is increased with use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in preterm infants. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection can be an important cause. The amount of bleeding varies. IVH is often described in four grades: * Grade I - bleeding occurs just in the germinal matrix * Grade II - bleeding also occurs inside the ventricles, but they are not enlarged * Grade III - ventricles are enlarged by the accumulated blood * Grade IV - bleeding extends into the brain tissue around the ventricles Grades I and II are most common, and often there are no further complications. Grades III and IV are the most serious and may result in long-term brain injury to the infant. After a grade III or IV IVH, blood clots may form which can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to increased fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). There have been various therapies employed into preventing the high rates of morbidity and mortality, including diuretic therapy, repeated lumbar puncture, streptokinase therapy and most recently combination a novel intervention called DRIFT (drainage, irrigation and fibrinolytic therapy). In 2002, a Dutch retrospective study analysed cases where neonatologists had intervened and drained CSF by lumbar or ventricular punctures if ventricular width (as shown on ultrasound) exceeded the 97th centile as opposed to the 97th centile plus 4 mm. Professors Whitelaw's original Cochrane review published in 2001 as well as evidence from previous randomised control trials indicated that interventions should be based on clinical signs and symptoms of ventricular dilatation. An international trial has instead looked an early (97th centile) versus late (97th centile plus 4 mm) for intervening and draining CSF. DRIFT has been tested in an international randomised clinical trial; although it did not significantly lower the need for shunt surgery, severe cognitive disability at two years Bayley (MDI <55) was significantly reduced. Repeated lumbar punctures are used widely to reduce the effects in increased intracranial pressure and an alternative to ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt surgery that cannot be performed in case of intraventricular haemorrhage. The relative risk of repeated lumbar puncture is close to 1.0, therefore it is not statistically therapeutic when compared to conservative management and does raise the risk of subsequent CSF infection.

The logo is trademark protected worldwide. Background The German \\"Grüner Punkt\\" is considered the forerunner of the European scheme. It was originally introduced by Duales System Deutschland GmbH (DSD) in 1990 before the introduction of a Packaging Ordinance under the Waste Act. Since the successful introduction of the German industry-funded dual system, similar Green Dot systems have been introduced in most other European countries. The Green Dot scheme is covered under the European \\"Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive - 94/62/EC\\", which is binding on all companies if their products use packaging and requires manufacturers to recover their own packaging. According to the directive, if a company does not join the Green Dot scheme, they must collect recyclable packaging themselves, although this is almost always impossible for mass products and only viable for low-volume producers. Regulatory authorities in individual countries are empowered to fine companies for non-compliance, although enforcement varies by country. Environmentalists claim that some countries deliberately turn a blind eye to the European directive. Since its European introduction, the scheme has been rolled out to 23 European countries. In some — namely France, Turkey, Spain, Portugal and Bulgaria — companies joining the Green Dot scheme must use the logo. The Green Dot is used by more than 130,000 companies, encompassing 460 billion packages. Concept The Green Dot system was thought up by Klaus Töpfer, Germany's environment minister in the early 1990s.\\"German Green Dot recycling system under threat\\", Deutsche Welle, 15 July 2013. Retrieved 20 May 2020 The basic idea of the Green Dot is that consumers who see the logo know that the manufacturer of the product contributes to the cost of recovery and recycling. This can be with household waste collected by the authorities (e.g. in special bags - in Germany these are yellow), or in containers in public places such as car parks and outside supermarkets. The system is financed by the green dot licence fee paid by the producers of the products. Fees vary by country and are based on the material used in packaging (e.g. paper, plastic, metal, wood, cardboard). Each country also has different fees for joining the scheme and ongoing fixed and variable fees. Fees also take into account the cost of collection, sorting and recycling methods. In simple terms, the system encourages manufacturers to cut down on packaging as this saves them the cost of licence fees. Black-and-white version of the \\"Der Grüne Punkt\\" DSD logo on a bottle of lotion, located between the PAO symbol and the resin identification code for LDPE, next to an EAN-13 barcode. German dual system of waste collection In 1991, the German government passed a packaging law (Verpackungsverordnung) that requires manufacturers to take care of the recycling or disposal of any packaging material they sell. As a result of this law, German industry set up a \\"dual system\\" of waste collection, which picks up household packaging in parallel to the existing municipal waste-collection systems. This industry-funded system is operated in Germany by the Duales System Deutschland GmbH (German for \\"Dual System Germany Ltd\\") corporation, or short DSD. DSD only collects packaging material from manufacturers who pay a license fee to DSD. DSD license fee payers can then add the Green Dot logo to their package labeling to indicate that this package should be placed into the separate yellow bags or yellow wheelie bins that will then be collected and emptied by DSD-operated waste collection vehicles and sorted (and where possible recycled) in DSD facilities. German licence fees are calculated using the weight of packs, each material type used and the volumes of product produced. Management Worldwide stewardship of the Green Dot logo is managed by PRO Europe (Packaging Recovery Organisation Europe)https://www.pro-e.org/ on behalf of the various national Green dot organizations across Europe. Symbol design and confusion The design of the Green Dot symbol has obvious links with the Chinese Taijitu (yin and yang) symbol and Gary Anderson's recycling symbol. Where full-color printing is available, its official form is printed in a light and a dark shade of green (Pantone 366C and 343C). For cost reasons or to avoid a visual clash with other symbols, many manufacturers chose a black-and-white or other color combination on their packages. The Green Dot logo merely indicates that a company has joined the Green Dot scheme, and not necessarily that the package is fully recyclable. The logo is often confused with the recycling logo. Lawsuits In Malta, Green Dot Malta Limited, a waste recovery company that is licensed from Der Grune Punkt Duales System Deutschland GmbH to use the Green Dot trademark in Malta, has successfully petitioned the Maltese courts on a number of occasions to protect the mark from free-riders and from competitors seeking to obtain unfair advantage from the international reputation and goodwill that it enjoys. In February 2009, Smart Supermarket, a well established local supermarket based in Birkirkara, Malta, was ordered by a judge not to sell, manufacture or pack products bearing the trademark Green Dot without the necessary licenses. Green Dot Malta Limited had argued in court that the supermarket was not only blatantly infringing the trademark and contravening the Trademarks Act but was also taking unfair advantage of Green Dot's reputation and goodwill without having its authorisation. The First Hall of the Civil Court, presided over by Madam Justice Abigail Lofaro, upheld Green Dot Malta Limited's request and issued a warrant of prohibitory injunction. Lawyers Antoine Naudi and Victor G. Axiak appeared for Green Dot Malta Limited. Following this injunction, the two parties reached an agreement whereby Smart Supermarket entered into a royalty license agreement with Green Dot Malta Limited and registered all its own branded food items such as confectionery and freshly packed products. they agreed to cooperate. The two companies also agreed to cooperate in ensuring that the intellectual property rights relating to the Green Dot mark in Malta will be further protected from any unlawful use by third parties including suppliers of the various goods to the supermarket. In April 2009, following a similar request for an injunction filed by Green Dot Malta Limited, the company Zamco Caterware Limited declared in open court that it was binding itself not to circulate any products in the market with the Green Dot symbol on their packaging without the required license. The company also declared that it would not be importing any product bearing the Green Dot mark unless the relative royalty contributions have been paid and unless they prove that the imported product will be recycled in terms of applicable environmental legislation. In September 2009, Karta Converters Limited, a company which produces and distributes articles made of paper, cardboard and plastic, was ordered by the First Hall of the Civil Court not to manufacture, pack, sell or otherwise continue circulating in the local market products bearing the trademark “Green Dot” without the necessary licenses. Presiding Judge Dr. Geoffrey Valencia accepted Green Dot Malta Limited's assertion that the company was conducting itself as a “free-rider” in the local market and that it was taking an unjust and unfair advantage of Green Dot's reputation without having its consent. Following this injunction, Karta Converters Limited issued a press release whereby it declared that it would be adopting the internationally recognised Green Dot symbol on its paper, carton and plastic products in accordance with the law. Karta Converters also declared that it would be joining some three hundred other companies participating in GreenPak, a waste recovery scheme operated by Green Dot Malta Limited, for the recycling of its packaging. Out of court settlements have been reached on a number of occasions with various other Maltese companies to ensure that the international reputation of the mark is safeguarded. In May 2010, Green Dot Malta Limited won a court case against Green.Mt Ltd, a local competitor which operates another waste recovery scheme in Malta. The latter was incorporated in 2007, a few years after Green Dot Malta Limited's registration. Green Dot Malta Limited petitioned the Court to declare that the name Green.Mt Ltd amounted to unfair competition in terms of law since the use of the “.” coupled with the words “Green Mt” was intended to cause confusion in the market. In delivering judgment, Mr. Justice Raymond Pace stated that the two schemes were obviously direct competitors operating in the same field of activity and that the name Green.Mt Ltd was creating confusion in terms of article 32 of Chapter 13 of the Laws of Malta. The court held that the law laid down that businesses could not use any name, mark or symbol which could create confusion with another name, mark or symbol used legally by others. The imitation did not need to be perfect. It was enough that in its entirety it could deceive a consumer. The Judge said that an examination of the words used left him in no doubt that the names could and indeed were creating confusion amongst consumers. The Court thus ordered Green.Mt Ltd to pay Green Dot Malta Limited a nominal sum by way of penalty and to destroy any offending material in its possession bearing the name Green.Mt Ltd within 30 days from date of judgment. Dr. Antoine Naudi and Dr. Victor G. Axiak appeared for Green Dot Malta Limited. Before final judgment was delivered, Green.Mt Ltd changed its name to Green MT Ltd.

It was used in many third-party video games from the mid to late-1990s, and during the same time on Sirius's MovieCDs that it had been originally developed for, enjoying an international distribution in both forms. Both MovieCDs and the MotionPixels codec remain an issue today in that medium market availability of MovieCDs remained until around the year 2000 and some of the above-mentioned video games still have a cult following, both producing malfunctions in modern PCs due to the outdated MotionPixels codec.  Origins and development  The MotionPixels (MP) codec used on MovieCDs originated with the Huygen codec developed by Christian Huygen, David Whipple, and Darrell Smith.StreamCast Executive Team (see entry for Darrell Smith)  Specifications and system requirements  The Rutles: All You Need is Cash. The MP codec offered a resolution of 320x236 pixels, 16-bit high color, and 16 frames per second fullscreen playback at a datarate of (in theory) up to about 520kB/sec, without having to install MPEG or acquire additional hardware, on Microsoft Windows systems from Windows 3.x on. Audio was saved in plain WAV format. Its FourCC code was, depending on version, \\"MVI1\\" or \\"MVI2.\\" For viewing MovieCDs, Sirius recommended a 486 processor or higher, at least 8 MB of RAM, and a 2x-speed CD-ROM drive (most MovieCDs had a data rate of about 280-300 kB/sec). MovieCDs had a running time of about 45 minutes each, so feature films often were stored on two or three discs in one box, and the consumer had to swap discs to watch the whole movie. The codec avoided digital compression artifacts such as the pixelization or block artifacts (seen in VCDs using MPEG-1) by treating areas of the frame as objects rather than dividing it into blocks. Its output was always RGB; however, the viewer could choose between different settings of chroma subsampling for encoding, from RGB through YCrCb 4:2:2 all the way to 16:1:1 which ensured for low datarates at what were high resolutions at the time, while a particularly low chroma subsampling made for a distinctively analogue video look to today's eyes, with spatially (not temporally) smeared colors and sharp luma. = MVI1 = MVI1 was a purely DOS-based codec, carrying its animations in an .MVI container. Apparently, the only occasion it was ever used was with Sirius's game Treasure Quest. = MVI2 = MVI2 was the Windows incarnation of the MotionPixels codec, and always came with its own player, the MotionPixels Movie Player. MVI2 files used the AVI container still popular today. It saw international distribution during the mid- to late-1990s in the form of Sirius's MovieCDs and many third-party video games (such as the Caesar series by Sierra). MVI2 came in three versions: * aware31.exe: Aware31 was developed for Windows 3.1x. * aware95.exe: Aware95 was developed for Windows 95. * awarent.exe: AwareNT was developed for Windows NT and released in 1998.  Economic viability  Given the dominance of the VCD and DVD formats, MovieCD never gained a significant following.  Compatibility and issues with modern PCs  = Compatibility = All MovieCDs had the MVI2 codec on them ready to install, and most video games with them installed both codec and player without asking the user. Both are still an issue today due to the wide availability of MovieCDs until around 2000 and the cult following some of these games still have. Both versions of the MP codec installing executable for Windows remain available on the web from third-party downloading sites for free manually as well as within codec packs. The codec's Windows 3.x and 95 version still runs more or less on Windows 98; however the videos often crash as this version of the codec was still a pre-DirectX artifact, even though they can even be played with any other video players on Windows 95 and Windows 98 once the MP codec is installed. On Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP, MP's NT version awarent.exe is needed. MP videos run stable on these Windows versions, and the codec can even be used to encode own videos into MotionPixels files, however serious other issues arise no matter which version of MVI2 is installed. = Issues = As soon as any version of the MotionPixels codec Windows version MVI2 is installed on any post-Win98 Windows OS, any video and audio-editing software on the same system may crash as soon as a codec- choosing dialogue for saving a file is opened. Additionally, players might be unable to read a variety of other audio and video codecs, and a variety of other both software and hardware-related video problems might occur, such as TV-cards ceasing to function. Running MotionPixels's uninstall routine that only removes the MotionPixels Player, not the codec itself, and not even Windows Control Panel can be used to de-install the MP codec, so the only way to get rid of it and reclaim a working system is to manually delete any single file containing the letters MVI in the Windows registry and the \\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32 directory. MovieCD catalogue The catalogue of both TV and feature film programs available on MovieCDs mostly spawned from deals with New Line Home Video, Anchor Bay, Alliance, Trimark, Rhino, and Central Park Media, with a total of 131 titles released, offering genres such as action, comedy, anime, computer animation and music performance. =List of titles= *1997 Playboy Playmate Video Calendar *1998 Playboy Playmate Video Calendar *Adult StreetSmart *The Adventures of Mole *The Adventures of Toad *Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction *Arcade *The Art of Nature *Beach Babes from Beyond *Best of Playboy's Strip Search *Best of SNL: The Best of Gilda Radner *Best of SNL: 15th Anniversary Special *Best of SNL: The Best of Dan Aykroyd *Best of SNL: The Best of John Belushi *Best of SNL: Classic Years, Volume 1 *Best of SNL: Classic Years, Volume 2 *Best of SNL: Hosted by Eddie Murphy *Best of SNL: SNL Goes Commercial *Betty Boop Cartoons *Beyond the Mind's Eye *BullySmart *Burns and Allen *Cabbage Patch Kids: The Clubhouse *Cabbage Patch Kids: The New Kid *Cabbage Patch Kids: The Screen Test *Cartoon Festival *Cher, Extravaganza: Live at the Mirage *Chronos *Class of Nuke 'Em High *Classic Cartoons *The Clones of Bruce Lee *Comedy Capers *Comedy Greats *Comic Relief VII *Computer Animation Festival, Volume 1 *Computer Animation Festival, Volume 2 *Cyber City Oedo 808: Data One *Dominion: Tank Police - Part 1 *Dominion Tank Police - Part 2 *Don Juan DeMarco *Dr. Katz, Volume 1 *Dr. Katz, Volume 2 *Dragon Fist *Dumb & Dumber *Elvis in Hollywood *First Blood *Friday *The Gate to the Mind's Eye *Genocyber, Part 1: Birth of Genocyber *Ghost in the Shell *The Grateful Dead, Dead Ahead *The Grateful Dead, Ticket to New Year's *Jimi Hendrix, Jimi Plays Monterey *Jimi Hendrix, Rainbow Bridge *House Party *Imaginaria *Imaginit *Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday *The Kids in the Hall *The Lawnmower Man *The Lawnmower Man 2: Jobe's War *Leprechaun *Leprechaun 2 *The Little Shop of Horrors *The Louvre *Macross Plus, Part 1 *Macross Plus Part 2 *Macross Plus, Part 3 *Macross Plus, Part 4Macross Plus Area Seven - Goods - MovieCD *Barry Manilow, The Greatest Hits *The Mask *Menace II Society *Military Aircraft Video Report - Volume III, Number 1 *The Mind's Eye *The Monkees, Volume 1 *The Monkees, Volume 2 *Monterey Pop *Mortal Kombat *Mumfie: The Movie *New Dominion Tank Police - Part 1 *New Dominion Tank Police - Part 2 *Night of the Living Dead *A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master *Ninja Scroll *One Step Beyond *Patrick Stewart Narrates \\"The Planets\\" *Playboy 21 Playmates Centerfold Collection Volume 1 *Playboy's Biker Babes: Hot Wheels & High Heels *Playboy's Cheerleaders *Playboy's College Girls *Playboy's Girls in Uniform *Playboy's Girls of the Internet *Playboy's Sorority Girls *Playboy's Voluptuous Vixens *Playboy's Wet & Wild VIII: Bottoms Up *The Player *The Poetry Hall of Fame, Volume 1 *The Poetry Hall, Volume 2 *Poison Ivy *Politically Incorrect: The Political Domain *Power Moves *The Princess Bride *Pump Up the Volume *Puppet Master *Quadrophenia *Reefer Madness *Return of the Living Dead 3 *Roswell: Cover Ups & Close Encounters *Rowan Atkinson Live *The Rutles: All You Need is Cash *The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb *Seven *Sex Madness *StrangerSmart *Subspecies *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles *Time Capsule World War II: Europe/Pacific *Trancers III *Urotsukidoji III: Return of the Overfiend - Episode 1 *Urotsukidoji III: Return of the Overfiend - Episode 2 *Urotsukidoji III: Return of the Overfiend - Episode 3 *Urotsukidoji III: Return of the Overfiend - Episode 4 *VH1: Guitar Legends *VH1: Psychedelic High *VH1: Rock in the U.K. *Warlock *Warlock: The Armageddon *Wes Craven's New Nightmare * The Who, The Kids Are Alright *Whore *Witchcraft  References   External links  *Classic Home Toys - Installment #6: What in the world was the Sirius MovieCD? *A detailed technical description of the MotionPixels codec on MultimediaWiki *A comparison test of the MotionPixels codec next to contemporaries Cinepak and Indeo 3.2, by Bob Currier, Synthetic Aperture *Aware NT codec for playback of movieCD AVI files on Windows XP computers.

The edifice was finished fifteen years later by Cristoforo Solari, divided into two parts: one for the faithful, one for the nuns. Until 1794 the latter were strongly forbidden to cross the dividing wall. Description The façade is covered with gray stone from Ornavasso. The interior has a vaulted nave separated by the divisory wall (the nuns followed the mass from a grating) and flanked by groin-vaulted chapels, which are surmounted by a serliana loggia.

He was known for his journalistic works during the civil rights movement and for his coverage of the 1955 murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till. He worked for The Washington Post, Jet, and Ebony. Biography =Early years= Born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Simeon Saunders Booker and Roberta Waring Booker, Booker moved with his family to Youngstown, Ohio, when he was five years old. There, his father opened a YMCA for African-Americans. While attending Covington Street Elementary School in Youngstown, he wrote a poem that was published in the local newspaper, the Youngstown Vindicator. While a high school student at The Rayen School (affectionately known as Rayen) in Youngstown, some of Booker's stories were published in the Baltimore Afro American, a prominent African American newspaper. =Education= Booker graduated from high school in Youngstown and then enrolled at Youngstown College, but transferred to Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia, when he learned that Black students were denied activity cards at the YMCA- sponsored school. He earned money during college by providing publicity for Virginia Union's sports teams. He graduated from Virginia Union with a degree in English in 1942. =Early career= Booker returned to Youngstown during summer vacations and published articles about the Negro league baseball games there. Upon graduating with a degree in English, he took his first job with the Afro-American. Booker later returned to Ohio and worked for the Cleveland Call and Post, where a series he wrote concerning slum housing earned him a Newspaper Guild Award. Booker was offered a prestigious Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University in 1950–51. =Journalistic career= In 1952, Booker became the first black reporter for The Washington Post. Booker was best known for his reporting during the civil rights movement while working for Jet and Ebony magazines. His coverage of the 1955 murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till in Mississippi and the subsequent trial is one of the most noted pieces of journalism from the era. During the 1960 presidential election cycle, in an attempt to garner the support of Black voters, the campaign of John F. Kennedy attempted to buy Booker's column in Jet magazine, meaning the campaign would write the column and the magazine would publish it under Booker's byline; Booker and the publisher refused. Booker retired in 2007 at the age of 88, after serving as Jets Washington Bureau chief for 51 years. Booker served as the Washington, D.C. bureau chief of the Johnson Publishing Company, interviewing presidents, members of Congress, as well as notable civil rights leaders, Martin Luther King, Jr., Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, A.

The river originates in Sabbathday Lake in New Gloucester and flows northeasterly into Auburn and then southerly through New Gloucester (via the Royal River Reservoir), Gray and North Yarmouth into Casco Bay at Yarmouth. The river is named for William Royall (1580–1676), one of the first European settlers in the area, though the official form of its name omits the second L. One of the earliest maps naming the river Royal was a 1699 map by Wolfgang William Romer on which it was spelled \\"Roiall River.” A Portland Magazine article, \\"Muddy Waters,\\" has prompted a conversation about whether or not the river should be returned to its original Native American name considering the Royall family's ties to slavery in Antigua. Sir Ronald Sanders, Ambassador for Antigua and Barbuda to the United States, states, \\"Heinous crimes of this nature have been celebrated in the name of this river. It should not require a great deal of difficulty to realize that celebration should be ended. That human life should be taken so easily and wantonly is wrong in itself.\\" Daniel R. Coquillette, co-author On the Battlefield of MeritHarvard University Press, October 23, 2015 says, \\"Isaac Royall Sr. was a brutal man, even by the standards of his time. He didn’t found Bowdoin College or anything. You could make it an easy case to change the river.” Dr. Natasha Lightfoot, associate professor of history at Columbia University, says, \\"I would certainly change the name. Keeping the name of 'Royall River' makes the river a lasting monument to the violence of slavery and settler colonialism in the Americas. There were communities established in the area long before the arrival of any European settlers. I would suggest researching what First Nations/Native American peoples lived near the river and likely used it for their daily lives and commerce, and naming the river after them.” The river is bridged by Interstate 95 and U.S. Route 202 before leaving New Gloucester, then by the Maine Central Railroad \\"Back Road\\" and the Grand Trunk Railway in Auburn, and then again by the Grand Trunk Railway and by State Route 231 when it returns to New Gloucester. The river is bridged twice more by the Maine Central Back Road in Gray. In North Yarmouth, the river is bridged again by State Route 231 and by State Route 9, and in Yarmouth it is crossed by the Maine Central Railroad \\"Lower Road\\", again by the Grand Trunk Railway, by U.S. Route 1 and, at its mouth, by State Route 88 and Interstate 295. During the 1700s and 1800s, Yarmouth River, as it was then known, was a source of great economic growth for Yarmouth as it provided the power for the many mills. One such mill was erected in 1872 by the Forest Paper Company on the current site of the Royal River Park. The river is mentioned in several of Maine-native Stephen King's novels, including The Body, when the boys cross the Royal River, only to be attacked by leeches, as well as 'Salem's Lot and Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The McKin Company Superfund site was within the Royal River watershed.  History  William Royall, a cooper, sailed from England to America on the Lion’s Whelp in 1629. After landing at Salem, Massachusetts, he worked as an indentured servant for the Massachusetts Bay Company. As a reward, he was deeded land on the headlands of the Westcustogo River, later renamed to \\"Royal River\\".Welcome - Westcustogo.com According to historian William H. Rowe, William Royall’s first homestead was at Fogg’s Point in Freeport, Maine. He later moved to Royall’s Farm, which was in the triangular piece of land between the Royal and Cousins Rivers. Repeated conflicts between colonists and the Native Americans caused William to take his family and remove to Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1675, a year before his death. William’s grandson, Isaac Royall Sr. (1672–1739), chose a life at sea, becoming a rum merchant, sugar merchant, and sought to make his fortune in the slave trade. By 1700 he was in Antigua, part-owner of a Massachusetts-built slave called the Mayflower. His son, Isaac Royall Jr, who played a crucial role in the founding of Harvard Law School, was born in Antigua 1719.

He attended the Qom Seminary, studying Dars-e Kharij Azghadi has notably opted not to wear any traditional religious garb that is often associated with Iranian politicians. In 2003, Supreme Leader Khamenei appointed Azghadi to be a member of the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution, which is tasked with adopting large-scale policies on social and cultural matters. In 2007, Azghadi was appointed membership to the Council of Representatives of the Supreme Leader in Universities, which he has used to deliver more speeches and wield a greater presence on university campuses across Iran, contributing to the greater conservative efforts to radicalize campuses, notably using Basij Student Organizations. Speeches and views Azaghadi has attacked the climate of the Qom Seminary since the election of Hassan Rouhani, arguing that it has lost its revolutionary pride and become too liberal, leading to greater secularization of Iranian society. Azghadi expressed his disdain for Reformist Present Mohammed Khatami, stating that he cursed the then President from \\"night until morning\\" for referring to Abraham Lincoln as a martyr and complimenting American culture.

Rock's Gaelic Athletic Club (Irish: CLG an tAth. Mac Con Carraige, An Chorra Chríochach) is a Gaelic Athletic Association club based in Cookstown in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. The club fields male and female teams across a multitude of age groups ranging from Under 6s to senior level. Their home ground, Paddy Cullen Park, is located at 1 Convent Lane, Cookstown, just behind Holy Trinity Primary School and Holy Trinity College. In recent years Owen Mulligan and Raymond Mulgrew have both won All-Ireland Senior Football Championship medals with the Tyrone senior team. The club also had five players who won All-Ireland Minor Football Championship medals on the same day in 2004.  Main Sponsor  Cookstown Fr. Rock's are currently sponsored by the engineering firm Steelweld Fabrications who are based in Cookstown. History In 1889 the first GAA club in Tyrone, Cookstown Owen Roe's, was established, just five years after the foundation of the Gaelic Athletic Association. In 1889 the prevailing political climate was one in which association with the GAA was not something to be sought. Numerous files from Dublin castle can bear testimony to this fact. Despite this Fr John Rock, a curate in Cookstown, initiated efforts to form the Owen Roe's club, and they were soon to fulfil fixtures with teams from Armagh, Derry and Belfast. The magazine Sport reported a game between the Owen Roe's and Armagh Harps, played on St Patrick's Day, 1889. It is quite possible that this was the first competitive outing of a team from Tyrone. In 1890 the membership of the club stood at 40 - all of whom were described by the RIC as 'AOH suspects'. The year however was to prove an historic one. On 12 October that year, Owen Roe's represented Tyrone in the Ulster senior football final, thus earning for the town another first, as they were the first Tyrone side to compete in a provincial final. By 1891 however, the club had all but disappeared as political tensions swept throughout Ireland. In 1905 the Gaels of Cookstown regrouped and out of the vacuum emerged a new force in Gaelic football, known as the Brian Ógs. The new club played its first game against a team from Coalisland in what would prove to be controversial circumstances. Whilst travelling to the game, the club was attacked near Tullyhogue by a hostile crowd of about 300. Stones were thrown and a brake carrying Cookstown players was driven unto a fence injuring several players. The team eventually played the game in Coalisland where they spent the night and were only able to return after an urgent request to Dublin for police reinforcements, was answered when over 100 police escorted the Brian Ógs home the following day. Despite such incidents the club continued to flourish and a minute book from the period 1907 to 1910, highlights the goings on at the fledgling club. The book still remains in the hands of the club and is the oldest first hand record of the early days of the GAA in Tyrone. In 1907 the club went out of existence for a short period of time and this led to the emergence of a club called the Cookstown Emmetts. By November 1907 Brian Ógs were back in business and continued to carry the standard in Cookstown for the next 30 years, becoming the dominant force in Tyrone football along the way. Within ten years of its formation the new club defeated Kilskerry McDonaghs by 3-1 to 2-1 to capture the senior championship. The following year they were in the final once more when they defeated Omagh after a replay. The Brian Ógs thus earned another first for the town by becoming the first side to win successive senior titles. In the 1930s another club emerged in Cookstown called the Geraldines. For the next few years the clubs existed side by side, boasting teams from all age groups. In 1928 however the end of an era drew to a close as following a suggestion from a local curate, Fr Taggart, it was decided that the two clubs amalgamate and on 6 March 1938 Fr Rocks GFC was formed. In the first year in existence the club qualified for the Tyrone county final.

They play in blue and gold colours. History =Foundation= In 1903, a small group of men, led by Mr Cathal O'Toole, formed the first Gaelic Football Club in the parish of Donaghmore. It was through the influence of our nearby and great traditional rivals, the then Dungannon Emmetts, that the Donaghmore Club was founded. On St Stephen's night 1903, Donaghmore Éire Óg was formed when a group of people came together, under the guidance of O'Toole. O'Toole himself was appointed President and Captain of the football team, while John O'Neill (Drumbearn), was made Vice-President and Vice Captain. Edward Carberry became Treasurer and William Cunningham Secretary, while the first committee consisted of James McCann, John O'Neill (Donaghmore), Joe Carberry, Joseph Daly, Joseph Brannigan and Henry Daly. The name Éire Óg (Young Ireland) was chosen by O'Toole as he had been a frequent contributor to the weekly Young Ireland column of the Ulster Herald newspaper. The new club set out to revive all things Irish and while it would play Gaelic football initially, hurling was to follow and a literary section was to be formed. O'Toole urged others to follow the example of Dungannon and Donaghmore so that Tyrone would \\"soon be ablaze with enthusiasm for the revival of our national games and pastimes\\". The chosen colours of Donaghmore Éire Óg were green jerseys with a gold sash, and they played their first match against Coalisland Fianna on Sunday 17 April 1904. The match took place in Coalisland, where an enthusiastic crowd had gathered even though both clubs were in their infancy. The match was won by Coalisland – on a score line of 2–6 to 0–3. =Championship success= Through the hard times in Ireland at the beginning of the 20th century, it was not until 1923 that Gaelic games found its revival and began to establish itself again. A few years later, one of the most memorable moments in the history of Donaghmore GAA took place on Sunday 18 December 1927. The venue was Springfield Lane, Dungannon. Fifteen men wearing the green and yellow striped Éire Óg jerseys marched onto the field, led by team captain Johnny McCullough. The event was the 1927 Tyrone Senior Championship Final, a historic occasion when the O'Neill Cup would be the prize for the first time. Donaghmore's opponents were Ardboe Pearses, and it was indeed Donaghmore who emerged narrow winners on a score line of 1–7 to 0–9, thus enabling Johnny McCullough to become the first man to collect the O'Neill Cup. =Name change and further success= One of the most important developments of Donaghmore GFC was the appointment of Fr Eamon Devlin as curate for the area. Fr Devlin was appointed in October 1941, and it was in Donaghmore that he would spend most of his clerical life, to 1969. Such was his influence, it was fitting that the current playing field was named after him when it was opened in 1974. It was under the guidance of Fr Devlin, that a meeting took place on Wednesday 26 January 1944, which amongst other things, resulted in the renaming of the club to Donaghmore St Patrick's, which still remains its current name today. The renaming of the club seemed to provide an added impetus to the team's performances on the field, where they captured the East Tyrone League in 1946, and again in 1952. Two years later, in 1954, Donaghmore won the Tyrone Junior Championship, and again won the East Tyrone League in 1957. This success at Senior level was further enhanced in 1959, when Donaghmore achieved their first success at Grade One level, winning the U-16 Championship. =Times of change= Just like the period of time itself, the beginning of the 1960s to the end of the 1980s saw an enormous change for Donaghmore GFC. Relegation and promotion was the story of the time for the senior in the 1960s, as they won Intermediate Championships in 1965 and 1968. A Youth Club was established in 1964, and it played a major part in bringing together the players that won the Minor Grade 1 Championship in 1967. By 1974 there was a new permanent home – Fr Eamon Devlin Park. This new playing field was opened on 25 May 1974, with a challenge game between Tyrone and Mayo being the main attraction of the day. Cultural success came to the club in 1978 when Denise McMullan won an All- Ireland title in Scór na nÓg in recitation section. The beginning of the 1980s began confidently, with the Senior team finishing third in the All County League in 1982 and reaching the semi-finals of the Senior Championship. However the next few years after were a struggle to keep senior status and after relegation in 1985 Donaghmore won the 1986 Tyrone ACL Division 2 title and were runners up in the 1986 Intermediate Championship Final losing out after a replay. Tyrone reached their first All-Ireland Senior final in 1986, and it was evident that the wave of GAA activity in the county at the time inspired our U-14's to achieve All-Ireland glory in 1988 – definitely one of the greatest achievements of our club. Coupled with this, the Senior team won the Intermediate Championship defeating Brockagh 0–5 to 0–4 to return to Senior ranks and the following year 1989 defeated local rivals Dungannon in the first round of the Senior Championship . Throughout the 1990s were barren times, although the Senior team maintained its position in Tyrone's top division. Youth teams were successful in this time, winning a Minor League in 1992, an Under −16 'double' in 1993 and an U-18 'double' in 1997. 2000s The club narrowly avoided relegation to the 2nd tier of Tyrone Football in 2008, but improved performance in 2009 have seen them secure safety with relative ease. Despite this the club have strong grass roots teams. The u-14s have claimed the grade 1 championship while the minor team were victorious in securing a historic double, beating a spirited Pomeroy side in the league final on a bitterly cold day in Galbally and overcoming an outstanding Greencastle outfit in the Championship decider also in Galbally. This team did not have a captain. Eugene McKenna and Joe Daly stepped down as senior team managers at the end of a run of the mill 2010 campaign. Although it was a possibility the team could go down until the penultimate game, a mid-table finish was secured. Their departure paved the way for former club great Adrian Cush to be appointed manager. Now that McKenna and Daly seem to have succeeded in halted the club's decline hopes are high that \\"Cushie\\" can lead his spirited troops onwards and upwards. This was indeed the case as the pats finished 5th in the division 1 ACL for 2011. While the club performed well in the ACL, they had an early exit in the championship at the hands of Omagh. From 2012 to 2015, Donaghmore battled through tough seasons in Division 1 under the management teams of Adrian Cush/Feargal Logan, Sean McCabe & Sean Marty Lockhart. The club dropped to Intermediate football at the end of the 2015 season for only the 7th time in the club's history. Gary and Richard Hetherington took the reins as managers to hopefully bring the club back to Senior football at the first time of asking, as the club had successfully managed on their other six occasions out of senior football. 2016 proved to be a very successful year, with Donaghmore collecting a Minor grade two league title, their first Reserve Intermediate Championship and most importantly, the Senior Intermediate League to clinch promotion to Division 1 for the 2017 year.

The club are named after the 1916, Easter Rising martyr, Pádraig Henry Pearse. History Over one hundred years ago the \\"Irish Rapperees\\" of Galbally were affiliated with the Gaelic Athletic Association for the first time on 30 April 1905. The club was named after the famous Shane Bernagh who carved his mark in the local area in the 17th century. As in the case of many Gaelic football clubs in Tyrone at this time, this club did not survive for long and by 1907 the Irish Rapperees were no longer in existence. Some ten years later The Galbally McDermott's were established. However, few details of the club are known and therefore it seems this was but a temporary flirtation with the Gaelic Athletic Association The Galbally St. Joseph's were affiliated in February 1931 and lasted until 1943. Despite their short existence, the St. Joseph's appeared in three East Tyrone Junior Championship Finals but with no success, playing Moortown in 1934, Pomeroy in 1935 and Washinbay in 1942. In 1937 Galbally GAA Hall opened and remained a centre point for the club and parish activities until the current Galbally Community Centre was built in 1995. The hall had been used for a wide variety of cultural and community events over the years hosting talent contests, Celi Dancing Classes, County Feis competitions, Traditional Irish Dancing and music lessons. The Present Galbally Pearses' club was affiliated in August 1949 with the now defunct East Tyrone Board. It wasn't very long before honours began to flow the way of the club when in 1954 the Pearses' collected their first silverware winning the East Tyrone Junior League. Further success continued with the minors winning the Clarke cup in the mid fifties and the seniors winning the Tyrone Junior Championship in 1958, beating Creggan in the Final. The sixties proved an important turning point for the history of Gaelic football in Galbally with its current grounds of today officially opening in 1961 and a lease being vested in the Gaelic Athletic Association. In 1962 the Pearses' club won the Feis Shield and after having an unbeaten run in the Intermediate league were promoted to the Senior Ranks of Tyrone Gaelic Football. It didn't take very long for the Pearses' to make their mark on the senior sides as in 1963 Galbally won a place in their first ever Tyrone Senior Football Championship Final against Omagh St. Enda's. Played on 1 September Omagh St Enda's wealth of experience proved decisive and the Pearse's were defeated by 2 goals and 10 points for Omagh, 5 points for Galbally. Between the late sixties and the late eighties the club was had some dull days though in 1977 the Pearses won the Division 5B League while in 1986 the seniors were defeated in the Junior Championship though gained promotion through the league. The club opened its first spectator stand in 1989. The nineties got off to a good start with the reserves winning the Intermediate Championship in 1990 while in 1991 the seniors won the Intermediate League. In 1993 the Minors Won Grade 3 Championship beating Killeeshil in the final while in 1997 the Under 14s won the grade 2 League and Championship double. In the same year the seniors reached their second ever Tyrone Senior Football Championship Final this time losing to Errigal Ciaran. In 1999 Galbally Pearses' celebrated their golden jubilee and opened their new floodlit training pitch. In the millennium year Galbally Pearses' officially opened their new playing pitch and extension to the spectator stand. In 2001 the seniors won the Jim Devlin Cup while in 2003 the minors won the Grade 2 Championship beating Stewartstown. In 2005 the club helped celebrate the 100th anniversary of Gaelic Games and Culture in the Galbally Area. In 2006 the seniors won the Division 1B League. Galbally were relegated from senior football in 2010. Galbally won the ulster intermediate league in 2011 and reached the Tyrone Intermediate Football Championship final the same year before losing to Kildress. Galbally started the 2015 season by winning the Ulster intermediate league for the second time in their history defeating Stewartstown in the final by a scoreline of 2–9 to 2–6. Galbally finished the season by winning the intermediate league with still a game to play after defeating neighbours Killeeshil on a scoreline of 0–18 to 1–6. The reserves also finished the season in style by winning the intermediate reserve championship against cookstown. In 2017 Galbally won their first ever grade 1 championship at any age group and their first adult championship since 1958 when they defeated Loughmacrory in the Tyrone Under-21 Football Championship final on a score line of 2–12 to 1–13 at Healy Park, Omagh thanks to goals from Liam Rafferty and captain Daniel Kerr. Galbally have had very successful youth teams in recent years including winning the u-14 Tyrone Feile in both 2010 and 2011. Galbally won the 2019 Tyrone intermediate football club championship, mainly due to the huge support from club member Dee Mulgrew. The future In 2008 Galbally Pearses' and the Oonagh Celts' embarked upon an ambitious project to improve and expand their facilities at Pearse Park. With the ever-increasing demand on the club's facilities, it was decided that Galbally Pearses'/Oonagh Celts' required increased capacity in relation to playing facilities to cater for the demands of the youth, men's and ladies' football teams. The purchase of the additional land has enabled the club to meet these requirements. The proposed development will be carried out in 4 stages and when complete will have cost in the region of £775,000. Phase 1 will consist of the purchase of an additional of ground; Phase 2 will consist of the development of 2 new playing pitches, an extended warm up area and the creation of a youth pitch for U8's and U10s; Phase 3 will consist of the provision of a running track and full floodlighting; and Phase 4 will consist of the improvement of existing car parking areas, entrance facilities, stand extension and new turnstiles. As of December 2009 one of the new playing pitch has been completed with work ongoing on the second pitch and youth pitch. The project is expected to be completed by late 2010.

Per Gunnar Fredrik de Frumerie (20 July 1908, in Nacka, Stockholm County – 9 September 1987, in Täby, Stockholm County) was a Swedish composer and pianist. He was the son of architect Gustaf de Frumerie and Maria Helleday. After studying piano in Stockholm and Vienna, he studied under Alfred Cortot in Paris. He then studied at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm from 1923–1928. Frumerie later taught the piano at the same college, from 1945 to 1974. His compositions covered a wide area, from grand opera to piano miniatures, but he is best remembered for his piano works. His works possess a Brahmsian complexity mixed with an impressionistic elegance. One can relate his music to such composers as Lars-Erik Larsson or Wilhelm Peterson- Berger. Although not noted for his theatre work, he did write an opera, Singoalla (1940). He wrote many songs, often to words by Pär Lagerkvist. The cello concerto (1984) has an interesting history. It was adapted from his second cello sonata. He then adapted it into a trombone concerto, and was his last completed work. It was specifically written for the Swedish trombone virtuoso Christian Lindberg. His pupils included Laci Boldemann. The Swedish mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter is related to Frumerie, as she is descended from the Frumerie family. They were both members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.

Life Cecil was the third son of Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter, and his wife, Dorothy Neville, daughter of John Neville, 4th Baron Latimer, by his wife, Lucy Somerset, daughter of Henry Somerset, 2nd Earl of Worcester. He was a grandson of Queen Elizabeth's great minister William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. Cecil served with the English forces in the Netherlands between 1596 and 1610, becoming a captain of foot in 1599. In May 1600 he was appointed to a troop of cavalry, which he commanded at the battle of Nieuport, under Sir Francis Vere. In 1601 he commanded a body of one thousand men raised in London for the relief of Ostend, then besieged by the Spanish, and on his return in September was knighted by Queen Elizabeth. He was elected Member of Parliament for Aldborough in 1601. In the spring of 1602 he was colonel of a regiment of English horse under Prince Maurice, and served in the expedition into Brabant and at the Siege of Grave. He commanded the English cavalry during the conquest of Sluis in 1604 during which he played a part in defeating the relief attempt by Ambrogio Spinola. He continued actively serving during the years immediately following, and made his reputation as a soldier. In 1610 he commanded the British and Irish contingent of four thousand men serving under Prince Christian of Anhalt in the War of the Jülich succession, at the siege of Juliers in July and August. This was the first ever army flagged as British under the Union Flag.S. Murdoch, ‘James VI and the Formation of a Scottish-British Military Identity’ in S. Murdoch and A. Mackillop, eds. Fighting for Identity, Scottish Military Experience c.1550-1900 (Leiden: 2002), pp.3-31 At court his credit also stood high. In March 1612 he was sent, as the prince's proxy, to stand sponsor at the baptism of Henry Casimir, son of Count Ernest of Nassau, and Sophia Hedwig, niece of Anne of Denmark, at Arnhem. Cecil gave gifts of a cupboard of gilt plate, a diamond necklace with a locket, horses, and an embroidered petticoat for Sophia Hedwig.A. B. Hinds, HMC Downshire, vol. 3 (London, 1938), p. 275. In April 1613 he had a commission to receive and pay all moneys for the journey of Lady Elizabeth and her husband, and in November he was ordered to request his lady to attend the electress at Heidelberg. In January 1618 he sued in vain for the comptrollership, and in February for the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster. In 1620 he was nominated by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham to command the English troops in Germany, but was superseded by Sir Horace Vere on the demand of Count Dohna, the agent of the king of Bohemia in England. A quarrel ensued between Cecil and Dohna, in the course of which Cecil assured his opponent that it was only his character as an ambassador which protected him from a demand for personal satisfaction. He was elected MP for Chichester in 1621. He supported Sir James Perrot's call on the House of Commons of England to commit to military support for the Palatinate in the early stages of the Thirty Years' War saying \\"This declaration comes from heaven. It will do more for us than if we had ten thousand soldiers on the march.\\" In 1624 he was elected MP for Dover. Cecil was given command of Buckingham's military expedition to Spain in October 1625, but so mismanaged the attack on Cadiz that he entirely missed the treasure ships which were the main objective of the attack. Nevertheless, in the following month, November 1625, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Cecil of Putney and Viscount Wimbledon, on the basis of his seat, Wimbledon House in Surrey. He returned to command the English forces in the Netherlands from 1627 (the Siege of Groenlo) until 1629 (the Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch). He served as Lord Lieutenant of Surrey from 1627 to 1638 and was Governor of Portsmouth from 1630 to 1638. He remained highly placed in the military establishment. Family Wimbledon Palace, Edward's home. Built 1588 Cecil married three times. He married firstly in 1601 to Theodosia Noel (born 1585), daughter of Sir Andrew Noel of Dalby. They had five daughters; (1) Dorothy (1603–1652), who died unmarried, (2) Albinia (died 1660), who married Sir Christopher Wray of Ashby, (3) Elizabeth, who married Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham, (4) Frances (died 1684), who married first James Fiennes, 2nd Viscount Saye and Sele and second the Reverend Joshua Sprigge and (5) Utriche, baptised 20 March 1616 in Utrecht, probably named after Utrecht and probably died early. Following the death of his first wife, in February 1618 he married Diana Drury (d. 1631), daughter of Sir William Drury of Hawstead, Suffolk, and Elizabeth Stafford.. Their only child, Anne, died in infancy. Cecil married thirdly, in 1635, Sophia Zouche (c. 1618–1691), daughter of Sir Edward Zouch of Woking and Dorothea Silking, by whom he had a son, Algernon, but this child also died aged less than a year old. Wimbledon died in 1638 and is buried in the Cecil Chapel at St Mary's Church, Wimbledon. Both his titles became extinct on his death.

Later it was entitled to St. Vincent, when the latter's relics were found in an urn in the crypt, together with those of St. Quirinus and St. Nicomedes (859) and St. Abundius. The name in Prato derives from its location in the \\"pratum\\" (in the field) area owned by bishop Odelpertus.

Washingbay Shamrocks flourished in period 1929-36 and 1939–48; won junior league in 1929, Dr. Collins Cup in 1932, SFC in 1934 (finalists in 1931), JFC in 1942. Today's club was formed in 1945, and named after Kevin Barry. The club saw success winning the Junior Football Championship in 1949. They beat Dungannon in the final in a low scoring game 2-3 to 1-1. Derrylaughan would become a permanent fixture in the senior ranks for the next 40 years winning two county titles. The late 1950s and 1960s were a golden era for the club reaching county finals in 1957, 1962, 1964, 1965 and 1966 before eventually claiming the O'Neill Cup in 1967 with victory over Carrickmore Saint Colmcille's. . While that team wouldn't challenge for top honours again the club was building quietly and claimed the first Tyrone Minor championship title in 1977. This team would provide a large number of players for the 1981 team that would claim the O'Neill Cup once again defeating Carrickmore in the final. The club rounded off a fantastic year for the community as they also won the county Under 21 title. Team manager on this occasion was Mena Devlin. Mena had been the team captain in 1967. Having suffered relegation to Division 2 in the early 1990s, the club struggled to regain their place in senior football but did eventually make their way back up claiming the 2003 Division 2 league title. They won this title again in 2006 but with the league restructuring the stay in senior football was short-lived. Derrylaughan regained their place in the top tier of Tyrone football, and completed the full set of championship titles when they beat Urney in the final of the 2010 Intermediate championship. The club has worked to update its facilities through the years. New playing fields were opened in 1981 and dressing-rooms in 1984. Redevelopment work in the late 1990s saw the clubhouse upgraded. A second pitch was opened in 2004. Derrylaughan regained their senior status winning the 2010 Tyrone Intermediate Championship following victory over Urney.

Their clubhouse was burnt down on 8 November 2008. On 19 July 2020 the club named stalwart Ronan Maneely Vice-Captain (VC) of the reserve team for the upcoming 2020 Tyrone GAA Division II season. History The history of the G.A.A. in Edendork can be traced back much further than 1932, the year in which the present St. Malachy's club was formed. Indeed, it was only three years after the formation of the Gaelic Athletic Association that the game was first played in Edendork. The year was 1887, and the match was probably the first ever in Tyrone. After a lapse of a few years, Gaelic football was revived at the turn of the century and continued sporadically though fervently for some thirty years at various locations in the district. Then in 1932 the present St. Malachy's GFC was founded by Larry Fox and immediately joined the East Tyrone Junior League. In 1936, Edendork won the league for the first time and reached the final of the East Tyrone Junior Championship, which they lost to Cookstown Brian Ogs. The following year they made it two league titles in a row, and made it a hit- trick in 1938, when they also won their first Tyrone title, the Junior Championship. The club won the league again in 1946, before clinching another three-in-a-row of East Tyrone Junior League titles in 1950, 1951 and 1952. Edendork entered senior football for the first time the following season, and also fielded a hurling team. It was back to Junior, however, in 1957, as emigration robbed the club of many of its leading players, but Edendork immediately made an impact by winning the Tyrone Junior Championship. Edendork returned to senior football with a vengeance in 1958, just failing to reach the senior championship final in a thrilling semi-final against a Frankie Donnelly-inspired Carrickmore. There was little in the way of success for the next eight years, in fact the club dropped back into Junior football; but in 1966 the team bounced back to Intermediate football with an unbeaten run to lift the league title. Edendork's greatest success came in 1969, when they won the Intermediate Championship, and two years later the club's camogie team won the Tyrone league. Two of Edendork's rising stars, Hugh Mooney and Kieran Currie won All-Ireland minor medals with Tyrone in 1973, both playing vital roles in an historic victory. In 1976, the camogie team achieved its greatest triumph by winning the Tyrone Senior Championship. Three years later, success returned on the field of play and Edendork lifted their second Intermediate Championship titlem and returned to senior football as double champions, having won the league as well. In the following season, the club's greatest honour was witnessed all over the world, as two of our members played in the All-Ireland Final against Kerry at Croke Park. The Mallon brothers, Joe and Mickey, were members of the Tyrone team which came so close to bringing the Sam Maguire Cup home.

Born in East Chicago, Indiana, he graduated from Hammond High School and attended both Michigan State University and Western Michigan University. He stood tall and weighed during his active career. Career overview Anderson signed with Chicago in 1954 and reached the Open- Classification Pacific Coast League in 1956 as a member of the Cubs' top farm team, the Los Angeles Angels. He had a stellar season as a relief pitcher, working in 70 games and winning a dozen, for the PCL champion Angels. The following year, he was recalled by the Cubs in midyear and spent parts of 1957 and as a member of the Cubs' bullpen corps and spot starter. In , he made the Cubs' staff for good and became a full-time starting pitcher, posting a 21–24 record over the next two seasons in 66 assignments, with 12 complete games and his only MLB shutout, a 3–0 six-hit triumph against the pennant-contending Milwaukee Braves on August 24, 1959.Retrosheet box score: 1959-08-24 In 1961, he transitioned back to a bullpen role, and received only 19 more starting assignments over the rest of his MLB career. He was traded to Detroit after the season. Reunited with Bob Scheffing, his manager with the PCL Angels and the 1957–1959 Cubs, Anderson got into 32 games for the 1963 Tigers and posted the only winning season of his career, as he captured three of four decisions. He then was traded again in the off-season, in a major transaction with the Kansas City Athletics headlined by slugger Rocky Colavito, but Anderson did not make the 1964 Athletics' roster and spent the year back in minor league baseball before leaving the game. During his MLB career, he won 36 games, lost 46, and compiled an earned run average of 4.26. He was credited with 15 complete games. In 840 innings pitched, he allowed 858 hits and 319 bases on balls with 502 strikeouts. Involved in unusual 1959 play Anderson was involved in one of Major League Baseball's most unusual and weirdest plays of all time in its long history, which occurred during a game played on June 30, 1959 at Wrigley Field between the Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals. Anderson was pitching and Stan Musial was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. The home plate umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, however Anderson and Taylor contended Musial had foul tipped the ball and because the ball was still in play, and due to Delmore being embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial took it upon himself to try for second base. Seeing that Musial was breaking for second, Cubs third baseman Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball, however that ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor at which Anderson's throw flew high over Tony Taylor's head into centerfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial, though, did not see Dark's throw and only noticing Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head then tried to go to third base, however, on his way over there, was tagged by Banks, and after a delay was ruled out. Oddly, in the final accounting, this most unusual and different play made no difference in the end result, a 4-1 victory for the visiting Cardinals.

History Harps Gaelic Football Club was founded in 1912 and played in the East Tyrone league until 1918. The Harps reformed in 1923 to play in the Stewartstown District (East Tyrone) league and it then won the first of its two Tyrone Senior Football Championships a year later. On our way to championship victory in 1924 the club defeated Beragh Red Knights by 3–5 to 2–3 in the semi-finals and then Omagh Coleman's in the final by 0–18 to 0–4. The Harps were also East Tyrone Senior League Winners as well that year. Unfortunately the Harps went out of existence at the end of the decade and it wasn't until 1957 that the club was reformed again. This reformation was down to the hard working Samuel Park and the club based its facilities in the townland of Mullaghmoyle. Since this reformation the Harps have been playing continuously ever since in the Tyrone leagues with a reasonable amount of success, most notably winning the O'Neill Cup in 1962. In the 1962 Tyrone Senior championship the Harps defeated teams such as Coalisland, Pomeroy and Urney on the path to the final. In the final the Harps met local rivals Derrylaughan Kevin Barry's and emerged victors on a 3-3 to 0-3 scoreline. There were jubilant scenes when team captain Paddy McNally received the O'Neill Cup from Paddy Cullen of the Tyrone County Board. The Sixties and Seventies was undoubtedly the most celebrated era in the history of the club. Along with the Senior Championship in 1962, an Intermediate League was won in 1964 as well as Senior league titles in 1971, 1973 and 1975. The Harps also reached the Senior championship final in 1972 but a Frank McGuigan inspired Ardboe proved too strong. Apart from an Intermediate Championship triumph against Augher in 1980 the Eighties and Nineties were not as successful. Relegation to Junior football for the first time since the club was reformed occurred in 1988. However the Harps fought back and won promotion immediately the following year in 1989 by winning Division 3. Stewartstown have had much success over the past years with the u i5s winning the og sport. Also the U-14s having a great squad In 1990 the Harps reached the Tyrone Intermediate Football Championship final but a severely weakened team proved no match for an Ardboe side who were Senior champions three years previously. Despite a good league showing that year as well, the Harps spent the next six years languishing in the lower regions of Intermediate football before being relegated to Junior football again in 1997. The Harps second spell in Junior Football only lasted two seasons as Intermediate status was regained for the year 2000 as a result of league restructuring. Three seasons of Intermediate football followed for the Harps before relegation back to Junior football again in 2002. Even though the Senior team was struggling there was still hope for the Harps as a strong youth policy was beginning to come to fruition. The U-16's won the league and championship double in 2001 while Minor leagues were won in 2002 and 2003. The majority of these players are now part of the Harps senior squad and they have now transferred this youth success onto the senior stage by winning Tyrone and Ulster Junior Club Football Championships in 2004 and in 2005 reaching an All- Ireland Junior Club Football Championship Final. 2005 was also a big year off the field for the Harps as a new pavilion was built at Mullaghmoyle to replace the existing pavilion which had been built in 1974. 2006 was the year when the Harps finally gained promotion back to Senior Championship Football after a period of 26 years, and it was fitting that the Harps were back in senior ranks in 2007, 50 years after the present Harps club was reformed. After being relegated in 2009 to junior the Harps went on a fabulous run in the league in 2010 only being beat once. In the championship Stewartstown made it to the final against local rivals killyman. The Harps lost the final by just 1 point. The league that year is the last thing the senior team has one to date but various youth groups such as the minors and even the women has gone on to win silverware.

It competes at Senior level in Tyrone GAA competitions (earlier clubs in the area having played at times in Fermanagh GAA competitions). The club plays Gaelic football, ladies' Gaelic football and camogie. History A branch of the Gaelic League was formed in Trillick on 29 December 1901, and the League pioneered the playing of Gaelic games in 1902. At a Gaelic League Feis in Trillick on 15 August 1903, parish teams from Trillick, Golan, Moorfield and Liffer played the first competitive football games in Trillick. By December 1903, a parish football and hurling club, named Lisdoo Young Ireland, had been formed, Lisdoo being one of only five teams taking part in the first Tyrone senior football championship in November 1904.Trillick St McCartan's club website In 1906 the Trillick Red Hands football team was formed; in 1907 they reached the final of the first Cup Competition in Tyrone, the McAnespie Cup, presented by Trillick-born James McAnespie. The Red Hands, Glassmullagh St Colmcille's and Coa hurling teams, and Trillick and Knocknagor camogie teams, all from the Trillick parish, played at a Gaelic League Feis in Trillick on 15 August 1907. In 1909 there were three clubs in the parish: the Red Hands (which disbanded in 1910), Golan and Bundoran Junction Éire Ógs; however until 1914, matches were only played on Feis days. The Trillick MacDonagh's team functioned in 1914–18 and 1923–28, but many prominent players were lost in \\"The Troubles\\". The Gaelic League flourished up to 1920, Trillick parish priest Fr Matt Maguire being President of Dáil Uladh. Following the establishment of the West Tyrone Board on 29 October 1931, the Trillick St Macartan's Club was formed in 1932, continuing to this day. The Ulster Council ruled in 1933 that the Tyrone County Board had jurisdiction over the club, rejecting the claim of Fermanagh. Trillick won the GAA's Centenary Year Club of Year Award in 1984. Gaelic football In 1937 Trillick won its first senior championship, being League winners in 1937, 1938 and 1939. Beaten by the eventual champions in 1938, Trillick were awaiting the 1939 final when the Tyrone County Board declared that year's championship void. Trillick's Paddy Donnelly captained Tyrone's first ever cup-winning team, the Dr Lagan Cup winners, on 8 November 1942. Trillick U-16's were Tyrone champions in 1965, being beaten finalists in 1964 and 1968, the U-18's being County champions in 1968 and 1969. Trillick won the Tyrone Senior Football Championship again in 1974 (when they reached the Ulster Senior Club Football Championship final) and have won five subsequent titles. Relegated to the Intermediate ranks in 2007, Trillick won the Intermediate Football Championship in 2008 defeating Moy in the final in Carrickmore. They progressed to the Ulster Intermediate Club Football Championship, and became the first team from the parish to win a Provincial title defeating Greenlough of Derry. Upon promotion to Senior ranks in 2015 they then went on to win the Senior Championship the same year, beating Killyclogher in the final on 11 October 2015 on a scoreline of 1–09 to 0–11. Trillick won another senior Championship in 2019 in remarkable fashion, beating Dromore by 17 points in the first round before beating Clonoe, holders Coalisland and Errigal Ciaran in the final on a score line of 0-12 to 2-4. =Honours= * Ulster Senior Club Football Championship  Runners-up 1974 * Tyrone Senior Football Championship (8)  1937, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1983, 1986, 2015, 2019 Runners-up 1987, 2020 (MacDonagh's) Runners-up 1917 * Tyrone All-County League Division 1 (10)  1937, 1938, 1939, 1973, 1977, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987  Runners-up 1976, 1978, 1981, 1998 * Tyrone Intermediate Football Championship (1)  2008  Runners-up 2014 * Ulster Intermediate Club Football Championship: (1)  2008 =Notable players= *John Donnelly, captained Fermanagh in the 1970s, managed Tyrone 1990s *Matthew Donnelly, All- Ireland Minor Football Championship medalist 2008 *Seán Donnelly, reached All- Ireland Minor final 1975 and Senior final 1986, captained Tyrone seniors 1980s *Niall Gormley, 2001 All Ireland Minor medal winner and 2008 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship medal winner *Pat King, Tyrone captain 1970s, managed Fermanagh 1996–2000 *Eddie Leonard, All-Ireland medallist with Tyrone minors 1948 *Dan McElholm, Tyrone player 1917 *Tommy McGee, Tyrone and Ulster player 1917–26 *Lee Brennan, Tyrone Minor and MacRory Cup medal winner and Ulster Colleges all star medallist 2013, 2014 & 2015 *Ruairi Kelly, Won an All Ireland U21, Son of Stevey and Roisin, hails from Tempo, choose to play for the Reds at a young age Ladies' Gaelic football Trillick Ladies Football Team won the Division Two League in 1995, and reached the county Championship final in 1999.

He published a few books and several articles concerning his work in the East Indies. In these he describes the geography, zoology, linguistics and ethnography of the islands. Biography In late 1839 he enlisted in the Dutch Harderwijk, and soon afterwards was stationed in the Netherlands East Indies as a military cartographer, tasked with making topographical surveys. He spent 30 years of his life working in the East Indies. From 1840 until 1856, Rosenberg was a topographical draughtsman on Sumatra and its neighboring islands. Afterwards he was a civil servant, working as a cartographer and surveyor in the Moluccas and western New Guinea. Rosenberg had a keen interest in ornithology, and beginning in the 1860s, collected specimens in the Indies for study and classification by Hermann Schlegel at the natural history museum of Leiden. He returned to Europe in 1871, and died in the Hague, Netherlands in 1888.

In 2014 they played senior football for the first time in their history. The club was founded in 1929, and participated intermittently until 1978 when it was reformed on a more stable basis. It has been a constant in the area since then. History Eskra Emmetts won a Division 3 league in 1986 to gain promotion to Division 2. They were relegated the following year and remained in the lower tier of Tyrone football until 2004, and lost two junior championship finals during that period including the 1996 decider. In 2003 the Emmetts won promotion from Division 3 by winning the Junior championship. They had been beaten in the final the previous year by Urney. Following this they defeated Armagh champions Annaghmore in a preliminary round of the Ulster Junior championship before losing to Monaghan Harps in the next round. In 2004 Eskra reached the intermediate decider, for a championship final appearance for the third year in a row. They were beaten by the future All-Ireland finalists Pomeroy. For the next ten years Eskra managed to maintain their intermediate status. In 2012 they again reached the championship decider where they lost to the eventual All-Ireland intermediate champions Cookstown after a replay. In 2013 the Emmetts reached the intermediate championship final for a third time and their second in a row.

The station is licensed to Boyertown, Pennsylvania and serves the Reading area. The station is under ownership of WDAC radio company. WBYN has two transmitters. The main transmitter is in a rural area 6 miles away from the station. The auxiliary transmitter and tower is located behind the station at 280 Mill street. Its coordinates are . History The station was founded by Dave Hendricks and was first assigned the call sign WBYO in 1969. The station employed a Christian teaching format with traditional Christian music played in between features. The station was a commercial operation but steered clear of Contemporary Christian Music except for a few hours on Saturday afternoon. On September 14, 1989, the station was sold and changed the call sign to WYCL and flipped to a gold based downtempo Adult Contemporary music format. The station played a couple new songs per hour but leaned light. The station played several uptempo songs an hour. Artists included The Beatles, Billy Joel, Kenny Rogers, Whitney Houston, Gloria Estefan, Chicago, Supremes, Elton John, The Stylistics, George Michael, and others. After a few years the station proved to be unsuccessful with the new format and went bankrupt. On January 24, 1992, the station was sold to WDAC Radio Inc. It was assigned the call sign WBYN and returned to Christian radio format which consisted of preaching, teaching, traditional Christian music, and information features. The station would sell time blocks to various ministries. On September 19, 2005, the call sign was slightly altered to WBYN- FM in preparation for a simulcast with 1160 AM (formerly WYNS), which adopted the WBYN call sign a week later. The music was traditional Christian music and played a few hours in mornings, late afternoons, and weekends. Some time in the 1990s, the station began mixing in softer contemporary Christian artists as well as Contemporary Praise and Worship Music. By 2000, the station was playing mostly Praise and Worship music and adopted the phrase \\"Life Changing Radio\\". =WFKB Frank FM= WFKB logo used from 2006-2009 WBYN and WBYN-FM were entered into an LMA with Nassau Broadcasting Partners early in 2006. WBYN 1160 kept the Christian format while WBYN-FM became \\"Frank FM\\" WFKB on March 15, 2006, broadcasting an Adult Rock/Classic rock hybrid formatted radio station. Frank FM had live air personalities during the day. Ken And Jenn in the morning, Randi Ellis middays (also PD/MD), Brian DiMario in afternoons, former Y100 Philadelphia jock John Von and Mike Roberts at night. Frank FM was also the launching pad for a then weekend personality named Rob Soscia, who now goes by his real name Brian Soscia and hosts The Soscia Network Radio Show formerly of Philadelphia's Mix 106.1 and now 2-7pm Mon-Fri on 93.7 WSTW. Other on-air personalities included Jay Pinnel and Zack Morse. The station started off as a hybrid of Hot AC, Classic Hits and Pop Alternative playing over 2000 songs. By the end of 2006, the station evolved into more of a heavily rock leaning classic hits format, including songs up until 1995. Core artists included Billy Joel, Kansas, Phil Collins, The Beatles, Elton John, Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, Chicago, Boston, Eagles, James Taylor, The Who, Neil Young, Kenny Loggins, The Cars, and many others. WFKB also began broadcasting in HD Radio and began to multicast. WFKB analog and WFKB-HD1 broadcast \\"Frank FM\\" while WFKB-HD2 broadcast the Christian format that also airs on 1160 WBYN. =Return to WBYN-FM, coming Alive= Logo prior to flip to Alive FM On March 31, 2009, the LMA between Nassau and WDAC-FM (owners of the license of WFKB) expired after being extended several times since November 2008 and the station's call sign reverted to WBYN-FM. On March 31, 2009 the station dropped the Frank FM format and reverted to a similar religious format it had been broadcasting prior to the LMA but not identical programming to 1160 WBYN which was on WBYN-FM HD-2. Nassau did acquire WBYN 1160. That station, therefore, kept the religious format that previously aired on WBYN-FMHD2. WBYN-FM's religious format focuses slightly more on music and slightly less on teaching, though Nassau's 1160 WBYN religious format has a moderate amount of overlap with WBYN-FM's format. So WBYN and WBYN-FM are separately owned. WBYN-FM has opted not to broadcast on HD1 or HD2 for the time being. Though not consecutively, 107.5 has been a Christian-formatted station on the FM dial for over fifty years. From the Newsletter: \\"The Nassau-WDAC deal struck in August 2005 was for an eventual purchase price of $22 million, and an LMA fee of $100,000 the first year, rising to $300,000 in the third year. Owner WDAC continued to operate its very successful Christian teaching WDAC (94.5) in the Lancaster, PA market.\\" As of early 2018, WBYN-FM's signature catchphrase was \\"Positively Different 107.5 Alive\\".

It is in Park Township on the banks of the Portage River at .  History  Park Township was organized in 1838, and Parkville was laid out in 1851 by Luther Carlton and surveyed by James Hutchinson. The first lot was purchased by Mary King for ten dollars. A mill pond and races on the Portage River provided power for a woolens factory built in 1851, a saw mill, and a grist mill built in 1853. In 1877 it had the mills and factory, three churches, two blacksmiths, a tavern, and a school. The churches were Seventh- day Adventist, Presbyterian, and Methodist Episcopal. The dedication of the Seventh-day Adventist meeting house in Parkville was on January 12, 1861, and was attended by Ellen G. White. She reportedly had a vision at that time of a \\"terrible war\\", this was three months before the firing on Ft. Sumter that began the US Civil War. (Reported in the book \\"Divine Predictions\\", by F.C.Gilbert, pages 214–222.) The Adventist church was later purchased for the Parkville Grange Hall, and the Presbyterian Church became the town hall. The Parkville Adventist church was moved in the 1990s to Battle Creek, MI, where it was restored to become a part of the Adventist Historical Village. The brick Methodist church still stands, although it is no longer a church. (Recently Demolished) Frank Dentler of Parkville invented the Dentler Bagger, one of the first automated pieces of farm equipment, for weighing and measuring the output of a threshing machine. He also operated a paddle wheel steamboat which carried goods from the factory and mills of Parkville to railroad stations on the Portage River.

Some critics consider it their best album, although others prefer earlier albums.Liner notes from the Tales of 1001 Nights compilations This is the first album in which Renaissance (Annie Haslam's version) did not use quotes from actual classical pieces and the first not to feature any songwriting credits from the original members. Contrary to popular belief, \\"Song of Scheherazade\\" is not based on Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade, but does have a recurring six-note motif that alludes to that work. History There is confusion over where the sections of \\"Song of Scheherazade\\" begin and end. This was caused by the fact that \\"Fanfare\\" and \\"The Betrayal\\" together sound like a single section, while \\"Festival Preparations\\" has two distinct parts of its own (4:00 and 1:11 in length). This confusion was reflected in the packaging and labels of original LP copies of this album, and in the mis-titling of \\"Festival Preparations\\" (part 1) as \\"The Young Prince and Princess\\" on the 1990 Tales of 1001 Nights, Volume I compilation. Also, as has been admitted by the administrators of the official Renaissance site, Northern Lights, assigning exact composing credits to the individual sections is difficult, since the composers borrowed themes from each other. For example, based on the official credits, which differ slightly between the actual album package and the official Renaissance site, a particular melodic phrase ends up being attributed to both Dunford (\\"The Sultan\\") and Tout (\\"Fugue for the Sultan\\"); lyricist Betty Thatcher is not credited for her lyrics on \\"Finale\\" (which are repeated from \\"The Sultan\\"). \\"Trip to the Fair\\" was about Annie Haslam's first date with Roy Wood.Liner notes from the Da Capo compilation \\"Ocean Gypsy\\" has since been covered by Blackmore's Night.

If you cannot produce a clear title of deed to the property then the prospective buyer should expect to lose in a specific performance action. Merchantable title and marketable title are synonymous terms. In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, there is an implied undertaking in the contract that the vendor (person selling the property) has a marketable title. The contract typically provides that on failure of a vendor to deliver good and marketable title, the vendee (buyer) may rescind the contract and recover any deposit. Merger If a deed is delivered and it has no warranty of title, the buyer has no recourse because the deed supersedes the contract. This means that the initial contract is no longer in effect. Closing Date Sellers only have to tender good and marketable title on the date the conveyance is executed (date of closing). So a seller may contract to sell property it does not currently possess. Liability will be imposed on the seller for breach only if the seller does not have good and marketable title on the date of closing.

The genre is broken down into two subcategories; \\"super robot\\", featuring super-sized, implausible robots, and \\"real robot\\", where robots are governed by realistic physics and technological limitations. Mecha series cover a wide variety of genres, from comedy to drama, and the genre has expanded into other media, such as video game adaptations. Mecha has also contributed to the popularity of scale model robots. History The 1940 short manga featured a powered, piloted, mechanical octopus. The 1943 Yokoyama Ryūichi's propaganda manga featured a sword-wielding, steam-powered, giant humanoid mecha. The first series in the mecha genre was Mitsuteru Yokoyama's 1956 manga Tetsujin 28-go (which was later animated in 1963 and also released abroad as Gigantor). He was inspired to become a manga creator by Osamu Tezuka, and began serializing the manga in Shonen, an iconic boy's magazine, in 1956. In this series, the robot, which was made as a last-ditch effort to win World War II by the Japanese military, was remote-controlled by the protagonist Shotaro Kaneda, a twelve-year-old detective and \\"whiz kid\\". The story turned out to have immense mass appeal, and inspired generations of imitators. In 1972, Go Nagai, another of Japan's greatest manga creators, defined the super robot genre with Mazinger Z, which was directly inspired by the former series. He had the revolutionary idea to create a mecha that people could control like a car, while waiting to cross a busy street. The concept became \\"explosively popular\\", making the manga and anime into a success. The series also was the genesis for different tropes of the genre, such as the idea of a robot as a \\"dynamic entity\\" that could join with other machines or humans to become unstoppable. Anime critic Fred Patten wrote that almost all mecha anime plots, such as monster of the week shows, were actually metaphors for re-fighting World War II, and defending Japan and its culture from Western encroachment. By 1977, a large number of super robot anime had been created, including Brave Raideen and Danguard Ace. The market for super robot toys also grew, spawning metal die-cast toys such as the Chogokin series in Japan and the Shogun Warriors in the U.S., that were (and still are) very popular with children and collectors. The super robot genre became heavily commercialized and stagnant, creating an opening for innovation, which was seized upon by Yoshiyuki Tomino in 1979 with the creation of Mobile Suit Gundam, a complex \\"space saga\\" that was called the \\"Star Wars of Japan\\" and birthed the real robot genre, which featured more realistic, gritty technology. Tomino did not like the formulaic storylines and overt advertising of the super robot shows he had worked on, and wanted to create a movie where robots were used as tools. While the response to Gundam was lukewarm at first, efforts by dedicated fans led to it becoming a success. It created a massive market for mecha model robots, and became an industry that earned Bandai ¥42.8 billion in 2004. Many real robot series and other media were later created, such as Full Metal Panic! and the video game series Armored Core. 1990 saw the release of Patlabor, a breakthrough animated movie directed by Mamoru Oshii that popularized the mecha genre and aesthetic in the West. Neon Genesis Evangelion, created by Hideaki Anno in 1995, was a major influence on the super robot genre, arriving when the real robot genre was dominant on television. A deconstruction of classic mecha anime tropes, it recast the \\"saintly\\" inventor/father as a sinister figure, and the enthusiastic teenage protagonist as a \\"vacillating\\" introvert. Due to its unusual psychological themes, the show became a massive success, and further caused Japanese anime culture to spread widely and rapidly around the world. The mecha anime genre (as well as Japanese kaiju films) received a Western homage with the 2013 film Pacific Rim directed by Guillermo del Toro. Similarly the genre was inspirational for the 1998 first-person shooter Shogo: Mobile Armor Division developed by Monolith Productions.  Subgenres  = Super robot = Some of the first mecha featured in manga and anime were 'super robots' (スーパーロボット sūpā robotto). The super robot genre features superhero-like giant robots that are often one-of-a-kind and the product of an ancient civilization, aliens or a mad genius. These robots are usually piloted by Japanese teenagers via voice command or neural uplink, and are often powered by mystical or exotic energy sources. Their abilities are described as \\"quasi-magical\\". = Real robot = The later real robot (リアルロボット riaru robotto) genre features robots that do not have mythical superpowers, but rather use largely conventional, albeit futuristic weapons and power sources, and are often mass-produced on a large scale for use in wars. The real robot genre also tends to feature more complex characters with moral conflicts and personal problems. The genre is therefore aimed primarily at young adults instead of children. The genre has been compared to hard science fictions by its fanbase, and is strongly associated with sales of popular toy models such as Gunpla. One of the \\"founding fathers\\" of real robot design was Kunio Okawara, who started out working on Gundam and continued on to other real robot series such as Armored Trooper Votoms. Mobile Suit Gundam (1979) is largely considered the first series to introduce the real robot concept and, along with The Super Dimension Fortress Macross (1982), would form the basis of what people would later call real robot anime.10 commandments of Real robot, Gundam Sentinel introduction, Gundam workshop, Format ACG In an interview with Yoshiyuki Tomino and other production crew members in the April 1989 issue of Newtype, about his views on the first Gundam anime that was not directed by him, he commented on the realism of the show, in which he sees the sponsors, Sunrise, as imaginary enemies of Gundam, since they did not accept a certain level of realism.Newtype magazine, April, 1989 Armored Trooper Votoms is viewed by Famitsu magazine as the peak of real-robot anime.famitsu news リアルロボットアニメの最高峰がスクリーンで蘇える！ 『装甲騎兵ボトムズ ペールゼン・ファイルズ 劇場版』 Peak of Real Robot anime on screen, Votoms movie. The concepts behind \\"real robots\\" that set it apart from previous robot anime are such as: * The robot is used as an industrial machine with arm-like manipulators and is manufactured by military and commercial enterprises of various nations.Robot Watch SF seminar, 29 April 2007, Interview of Ryōsuke Takahashi The side of Real Robot (SFセミナー「高橋良輔インタビュー リアルロボットの向こう側」レポート) * The concept of industrial production and commercial manufacturing processes appeared for the first time in the history of robot shows, introducing manufacturing language like \\"mass-production\\" (MP), \\"prototype\\" and \\"test-type\\". * While classic super robots typically use special attacks activated by voice commands, real robots more commonly use manually operated scaled-up/advanced versions of infantry weapons, such as lasers/particle beams, firearms, melee weapons (swords, axes, etc) and shields. * Real robots use mostly ranged weapons that require ammunition supply.Hatena keyword Hatena * Real robots require periodic maintenance and are often prone to malfunction and break down, like real machines. Types =Piloted= This ubiquitous subgenre features mecha piloted internally as vehicles. The first series to feature such mecha was Go Nagai's Mazinger Z. In a 2009 interview, Go Nagai claimed the idea came to mind when he was stuck in a traffic jam and wished his car could sprout arms and legs to walk over the cars in front. Other examples include Mobile Suit Gundam (1979), The Super Dimension Fortress Macross (1982), and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (2007). There are series that have piloted mecha that are also in the sentient category, usually because of an AI system to assist and care for the pilot, as featured in Blue Comet SPT Layzner (1985) and Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet (2013), or because the mecha is also an organic creature, as featured in Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995). =Sentient= These are mecha that have the ability to be self-aware, think, and sometimes feel emotion. The source of sentience varies from aliens, such as the titular characters of American- produced and Japanese-animated series, The Transformers (1984), to artificial intelligence, such as the robots of Brave Police J-Decker (1994) to magic, such as Da-Garn of The Brave Fighter of Legend Da-Garn (1992). The first series that featured a sentient giant robot, also the first mecha anime in color, was Astroganger (1972). =Remote controlled= These are mecha that are controlled externally. The first mecha anime, Tetsujin 28-go (1966), Giant Robo (1967) and danball senki Also known as little battlers experience are famous examples. =Transforming= A transforming mech can transform between a standard vehicle (such as a fighter plane or transport truck) and a fighting mecha robot. The concept of transforming mecha was pioneered by Japanese mecha designer Shōji Kawamori in the early 1980s, when he created the Diaclone toy line in 1980 and then the Macross anime franchise in 1982. In North America, the Macross franchise was adapted into the Robotech franchise in 1985, and then the Diaclone toy line was adapted into the Transformers franchise in 1986. Some of Kawamori's most iconic transforming mecha designs include the VF-1 Valkyrie from the Macross and Robotech franchises, and Optimus Prime (called Convoy in Japan) from the Transformers and Diaclone franchises. The concept later became more popular in the mid-1980s, with Macross: Do You Remember Love? (1984) and Zeta Gundam (1985) in Japan, and with Robotech (1985 adaptation of Macross) and Transformers (1986 adaptation of Diaclone) in the West. =Wearable= This refers to mecha that are powered exoskeletons rather than piloted as vehicles, such as in Genesis Climber MOSPEADA (1983), Bubblegum Crisis (1987) and Active Raid (2016); merge with the mecha, such as in The King of Braves GaoGaiGar (1997); combine with the robots, such as in Transformers: Super-God Masterforce (1988); or become mechanical themselves, such as in Brave Command Dagwon (1996) and Fire Robo (2016). Model robot Assembling and painting mecha scale model kits is a popular pastime among mecha enthusiasts. Like other models such as cars or airplanes, more advanced kits require much more intricate assembly. Lego mecha construction can present unique engineering challenges; the balancing act between a high range of motion, good structural stability, and aesthetic appeal can be difficult to manage. In 2006, the Lego Group released their own somewhat manga-inspired mecha line with the Lego Exo-Force series.

Aside from serving as proof of Finnish nationality, they facilitate the process of securing assistance from Finnish consular officials abroad (or other EU consulates in case a Finnish consular official is absent). Finnish passports share the standardised layout and burgundy-red cover with other EU countries. Passports are issued by the local police or by an authorised Finnish diplomatic mission abroad. Men who are less than 30 years of age and consequently eligible for military service, but have not completed it, may only be issued a passport with an expiration date up to the last legal start date for completion of the obligation, which is at the age of 28. Men older than 30 can receive a passport with normal expiry dates regardless of the status of completion of the military duty. Every Finnish citizen is also a citizen of the European Union. The passport, along with the national identity card allows for free rights of movement and residence in any of the states of the European Union, European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Physical appearance From 1996, Finnish passports have had burgundy-coloured covers and use the standard European Union passport layout, with the Finnish Coat of arms emblazoned in the centre of the front cover. The words \\"Euroopan unioni\\" (Finnish) and \\"Europeiska unionen\\" (Swedish) meaning \\"European Union\\" are inscribed above the coat of arms, and the words \\"Suomi - Finland\\", the country's name in Finnish and Swedish, and \\"Passi - Pass\\", meaning \\"Passport\\" in Finnish and Swedish, below. In older non-biometric EU passports issued prior to August 2006, the words were entirely in capital letters, but current versions use mixed case. Biometric passports, first issued on 21 August 2006, also have the standard biometric symbol at the top. In 2012, the coat of arms was enlarged and the European Union title was shifted below it and separated by a double line from the country's name which is now in all capitals. The biometric symbol has been moved to the bottom. The inside pages contain drawings of an elk that when flipped rapidly show the elk in motion. The cover is embossed with a snowflake motif. Visa requirements Visa requirements for Finnish citizens In 2018, Finnish citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 187 countries and territories, ranking the Finnish passport third in the world (tied with Danish, French, Italian, South Korean, Spanish and Swedish passports) according to the Henley Passport Index. Additionally, Arton Capital's Passport Index ranked the Finnish passport second in the world, with a visa-free score of 165 (tied with Danish, Dutch, German, Luxembourgish, Norwegian, South Korean, Swedish and United States passports), as of 30 July 2018.https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php Different spellings of the same name Names containing special letters (ä, ö) are spelled the correct way in the non-machine-readable zone, but are mapped in the machine-readable zone, ä becoming AE, and ö becoming OE.

In 1787, the English writer Arthur Young described the town as \\"the pearl of the Limousin\\" because of its picturesque setting. Built on a defensible rocky outcrop in an oxbow of the river Vézère, and located at a medieval crossroads, Uzerche has a long cultural heritage. Under Pepin the Short, the city was the seat of an influential abbey and a seneschal. Uzerche still has many castles, hotels, and other buildings displaying turrets built by the Uzechoise nobility, thus adding weight to the saying \\"He who owns a house in Uzerche has a castle in the Limousin.\\" In 1996 Uzerche was awarded \\"village étape\\" status and, since 2010, has been listed among the towns of France to be worthy of a \\"plus beaux détour\\". Name The name Uzerche may date as far back as Roman times. Taken by the Romans in 51 BC, it was the last place where the Gauls fought against Julius Caesar. The first clear proof of the name dates to the seventh century AD, when the town was known as Usarca. In 848 the name became Usercensium, and in 1190 Uzercha. Between the 15th and 18th centuries the name evolved from Usarche to Userche and eventually to the current spelling. Location Uzerche is located in west-central France, on the west flank of the Massif Central. Both the rivers Bradascou and Vézère, with their sources in the plateau of Millevaches, pass through Uzerche and feed into the Dordogne. The Plateau de Millevaches (a thousand springs), not far from Uzerche, is a natural wetland with its many streams and lakes, forest and heathland. It is 500– 900 meters above sea level with its highest point Mont Bessou (976 meters above sea level). Uzerche is a hill town, built above a deeply incised meander of the Vézère River; as such it is a natural citadel. The construction of the gardens along the Vézère, supported by little walls, are as noteworthy as the town's unique position and particular architectural features. As the rocky ground originally made it unsuitable for agriculture, the view of the lower part of the town is dominated by flowers, orchards and vegetable gardens. History = Strategic location = By the 2nd century BC, Gauls had taken advantage of the strategic location of present-day Uzerche—on high ground surrounded by a river—and established a settlement there. The site overlooks the nearby hill of Saint Eulalie, a place of pilgrimage dedicated to the 3rd- century Spanish martyr Saint Eulalie. Since before Roman times, Uzerche was situated at the intersection of two trade routes: one connecting Brittany with the Mediterranean Sea, the other allowing people to cross the river Vézère. The importance of this crossroads during antiquity is evidenced by the presence of a castra, or small fortification. Between the 5th and 8th century AD the town developed as an important administrative, religious, and political centre. Due to its defensible location, the town was able to resist many attacks through the centuries. After being looted and destroyed by Visigoths in the 6th century, it was rebuilt in the 7th century with a fortified perimeter wall that enhanced its defenses. In 8th century, a Saracen force defeated by Karel Martel attacked and besieged Uzerche during their retreat. The siege lasted seven years, but the Saracens ultimately gave up after a last desperate action by the inhabitants. On the point of starvation, they had fattened up the last two of their cattle with the last of their food. They then chased the animals out of the town towards the besiegers. The Saracens, upon seeing the animals, concluded that the city was too well provisioned for them to waste any more time trying to starve them out. To the present day two bulls can be seen on the coat of arms of Uzerche as a reminder of the siege. After the siege against his half-brother Waifer, Pepin the Short, King of the Francs (751- 768), was convinced of the strategic importance of Uzerche and had no fewer than eighteen towers built in the town, the most impressive being Leocaine, which was established as a royal residence. =Frankish fortress to the Abbey of Saint Pierre= church of Saint-Pierre A castrum (fortress) was intended to be a centre for all decisions: military, political and religious. The administrative function of the fortress at Uzerche is verified in the 7th century by the gold coins of that date minted there. Coins continued to be minted there until the 9th century. Uzerche also had an important religious role, with its own curate, as part of the territorial administrative sub- division of the authority of the Count of Limoges. Politically it was the capital of the Gallic-Roman area surrounding it. With permission of both pope and king, a monastery was founded in the 10th century with the building funded by numerous donations. The city of Uzerche began to take shape around the monastery. All the 100 resident monks were vassals of the abbot and he himself was a vassal of the king. In 1095 Pope Urban II travelled to Clermont-Ferrand to prepare for his first crusade and also made a visit to Uzerche in the same year. A monk named Maurice Bourdin, who was born in the neighbourhood of Uzerche, set up as an anti-pope from 1118 to 1121, under the name of Gregory VIII. The Benedictine Abbey was powerful and prosperous with its golden age from 12th to 13th century. Little remains of the original abbey except the church of Saint Pierre, an unmistakable monument to the Roman art of the Limousin of that time and the crypt which contains relics of the two Breton bishops, venerated as pilgrims of the Saint Jacques de Compostelle pilgrim route: Saint-Leonard and Saint Coronat. =10th to 14th centuries= la Porte Bécharie In the year 909 the Normans looted the city. Later, in 992, Archimbald I, viscount of Segur, gifted the 'Chapelle Notre-Dame' to the monks of the Abbey. This chapel still exists in Uzerche at the 'Place des Vignerons'. Around 1159 Uzerche became under the domination of the Normans. In the 12th Century another period of power and wealth started for Uzerche. Several important and powerful people came to visit the Abbey; among them were King Henry I of England (1156) and King Richard I of England (1189). The 12th and 13th Centuries saw the height of the popularity of the troubadours Gaucelm Faidit and Uc de la Bachellerie who were very well received in Uzerche. The middle of the 13th Century saw another wave of important and royal visitors in Uzerche. Louis IX of France in 1244 and 1256, Philippe III of France in 1285, Pope Clement V in 1306 and Charles IV of France in 1324. The bubonic plague had a catastrophic effect on Uzerche, bringing in its wake, death and disaster. Following the old tradition of giving thanks to St. John for protecting them, people in Uzerche, to this day, hang a walnut branch on their front door every 24 June. In 1374 Uzerche had three royal lilies addes to their Coat of Arms by King Charles V, as a reward for the energetic defence of the city against attacks by the English. Also in the 14th Century, three new fortresses were built and permission was given for the construction of nine gates, giving access to the city. The only surviving one of these gates is 'la Porte Becharie'. =Development of the judiciary and royal patronage of the city= Old town of Uzerche From the 15th Century Uzerche's development went from strength to strength. Louis XI visited the city in 1463 and decided to assign half the seats of the royal assize court from his Senechal to Uzerche. Manly newly created nobles (noblesse de robe) settled in Uzerche, building hostels, great houses and castles such as Chateau Pontier, Hotel des Joyet de Maubec, Maison Boyer-Chammard, Maison Eyssartier, Maison de Tayac and Hotel Becharie. This continued through to the 16th Century. To this day the skyline or Uzerche, with its many towers, bears witness to this spate of building. In 1558 the city obtained its Royal Assize Court, rivalled only by that of Brive- la-Gaillarde. The power of the Abbey and the development of the Assize court were responsible for Uzerche becoming the capital of the Bas-Limousin. Despite all this, the Wars of Religion quickly put an end to the prosperity of Uzerche. In 1557 the Huguenots, under the leadership of the viscount of Turenne, destroyed the Abbey. From 1628 the royal officers were the last remaining people with power in the city. In 1753 the bridge Pont Turgot was completed, connecting the suburb St Eulalie with the old town of Uzerche. =From the French Revolution to the present day= Viaduct of the PO-Corrèze with the tannery next to the Vézère On 14 July 1789 the storming of the Bastille took place, Louis XVI was deposed and the French Revolution started. On 30 July 1789 rumour spread in Uzerche that the Count of Artois, brother of Louis XVI, was on his way to the city with 16000 soldiers. His army came from Bordeaux and had burned down several towns on the way. Uzerche prepared to defend itself but the rumoured army did not arrive. It turned out to be a trick to get the Uzerchians armed in case it was necessary. The department of the Corrèze was formed in 1790. It was composed of four districts: Brive, Tulle, Ussel and Uzerche. Each of these districts was divided into 41 cantons, each composed of several communes. During the years of the war of the revolution (1792-1793) two Uzerchians distinguished themselves, General Materre and Colonel Vareliaud. Alexis Boyer, also a Uzerchian, became personal surgeon to the emperor Napoleon I and followed him in his campaigns in Poland and Prussia. In 1826 the commune of St. Eulalie was added to Uzerche. Planned in 1840 and completed in 1855 the road tunnel remained the only one on the 'route national' for a century. In 1892 a tunnel for the railway was added for Uzerche-Seilhac-Tulle and Argentat. The construction of the viaduct gave a new dimension to Uzerche. This viaduct of 142 meters long, with 12 arches, was completed in 1902 and made possible the connexion of station 'PO Corrèze', north of the city, to the station 'la petite gare' in the centre of the city. The railway functioned until 1969 when it was closed down and is now used as a footpath. On 5 November 1870, Monsieur Tayac, mayor of Uzerche informed his council of the collapse of the empire and the forming of the Third Republic. On 13 November 1870 the council of Uzerche voted unanimously to recognise and support the Third Republic. After the French defeat in the Franco-German War in 1871 the Third French Republic was announced officially. In 1939 France declared war on Germany thus entering the Second World War. In June 1944, a day after the first D-Day landing in Normandy, General Heinze Lammerding of the SS-Panzer-Division Das Reich gave the order to choose a place between Tulle and Limoges to break the Resistance. A number resistance fighters attacked a train at Allassac station, liberating the journalist and resistance fighter Gerhard Leo. Among this group was Lieutenant Michel who was later arrested and hanged in Uzerche under the order of General Lammerding. Traffic and transport Railway station at Uzerche The motorway A20 passes Uzerche on the boundary of the town. The departmental road D920 crosses the village in north–south direction. From the A20 there are two exits to the D920 towards Uzerche, exit 44 from the direction Limoges/Paris and exit 45 from the direction Brive/Toulouse. Uzerche is blessed with a railway station with direct connections to Limoges, Paris and Toulouse. The railway station is situated on the 'Avenue de la gare', the road from Uzerche towards Condat sur Ganaveix. In 2010 the railway station was renovated completely. Population  Agriculture  Limousine cow Between 1988 and 2000, 20 farms disappeared, bringing the total back from 43 to 23 farms. In 2000, most agriculture was largely dedicated to raising animals, with 80% bovine cattle and some 10% other animals. the fruit and vegetable field crops made up little more than 5% of the total agriculture area.Source : AGRESTE, recensement agricole 2000 Site de l'AGRESTE  Personalities  Image:Gaucelm Faidit - BN MS fr 12473.jpg Image: Alexis Boyer.jpgAlexis Boyer Image:JeanBaptisteLéonardDurand.jpg Image:Général Brugère.jpg Image:cueco.png * Gaucelm Faidit (Around 1150- to 1205) - one of history's most prolific troubadours, born in Uzerche. * François de Grenaille (1616–1680) - writer born in Uzerche. * Guillaume Grivel (1735–1810) - writer and lawyer born in Uzerche.Antoine-Vincent Arnaul et al, Biographie nouvelle des contemporains, p.338, Grivel (Guillaume) at Google Books, accessed 15 December 2013. * Alexis Boyer (1737–1833) - Doctor and anatomist born in Uzerche. * Jean Baptiste Léonard Durand (1742–1812) - Administrator and ex-Director of the Compagnie du Sénégal, born in Uzerche. * Félicité de Genlis (1746–1830) - Woman of letters, she ran a woman's hostel in Uzerche from 1782.

History After the failed Kościuszko Uprising of 1794, Emperor Francis II of Habsburg agreed with Empress Catherine II of Russia to again divide and thereby completely abolish the remaining Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a decision which Prussia joined on 24 October 1795. The Habsburg Monarchy, which had not participated in the Second Partition, now received a share that comprised the lands north of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria gained in the First Partition of 1772. The Habsburg Monarchy then occupied the entirety of Lesser Poland, stretching along the upper Vistula river to the outskirts of Praga and Warsaw, the tributaries of Bug and Pilica forming the northern border with New East Prussia. In 1803, it was merged with the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, but retained some autonomy. It remained a territory of the Austrian Empire even when, in 1807, Napoleon I of France created the Duchy of Warsaw from territories in Greater Poland which Prussia had annexed in the Second and Third Partition and now was forced to renounce according to the Treaty of Tilsit. Austria lost New Galicia in the 1809 War of the Fifth Coalition, after a corps under Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este on 15 April 1809 started the Polish–Austrian War by invading the Duchy of Warsaw. Despite the archduke's plans to move in as a national liberator he was challenged by the forces of Prince Józef Poniatowski at the Battle of Raszyn. Austria was finally defeated at the Battle of Wagram on 6 July, whereafter New Galicia was attached to the Duchy of Warsaw by the Treaty of Schönbrunn. With the Final Act of the Vienna Congress in 1815, the territory became part of Congress Poland, ruled in personal union by Emperor Alexander I of Russia, while Kraków nominally retained its independence as the Free City of Kraków. Administration From 1797, the seat of the local government (Gubernium) was located at Kraków.

The station uses six broadcast towers to create different directional signal patterns for daytime and nighttime. During the daytime, WEEU's signal is aimed toward the northwest and the southeast from its transmitter site near Shartlesville, northwest of Reading. During the evenings, WEEU's signal is directed toward the southeast to cover Reading. 830 AM is a United States clear-channel frequency on which WCCO in Minneapolis, Minnesota is the dominant Class A station. WEEU reduces power and becomes more directional to the southeast during nighttime hours in order the protect the skywave signal of WCCO. The station is also a part of the Philadelphia Phillies Radio Network, broadcasting Phillies games live. History WEEU began broadcasting January 4, 1932, on 830 kHz as a daytime-only station with 1 kW of power. In 1941, WEEU's frequency was changed to 850 kHz as a result of NARBA, and in 1949 it added a directional nighttime signal. In 1999, WEEU moved back to 830 kHz with a more powerful 5 kW daytime and 6 kW nighttime signal from a new five-tower transmitter site just north of I-78 near Shartlesville, PA. In the early 2000s, WEEU added a sixth tower and upgraded its daytime signal to 20 kW. As a result of the bankruptcy of the Reading Eagle Company and the May 2019 sale of most its assets to MediaNews Group, WEEU was put up for sale, with tentative plans to shut the station down at the completion of the sale of the newspaper, which was to take place at least 30 days after bankruptcy court approval and before July 31, 2019.

Her poetry collection Heroes, Advise Us was the 1964 Lamont Poetry Selection.  Life  Stoutenburg was born in Darfur, Minnesota. Following her father's death in 1918, she was raised by her paternal grandmother in Hanley Falls, Minnesota. She finished high school in Minneapolis, and attended the Minneapolis School of Art from 1936 to 1938. She then worked as a librarian and in other capacities near Richfield, Minnesota. Includes \\"Cicada\\" and \\"Before We Drown\\". In 1943, she published her first book of children's fiction, The Model Airplane Mystery. Stoutenburg later wrote, \\"After publishing in many magazines, I seriously settled down to writing books in 1951. She had published four books of children's fiction by 1956, when she moved to California to become an editor at Parnassus Press, a publisher of children's literature. She held the position at Parnassus Press until 1958. Over her career, Stoutenburg published about forty books of juvenile fiction and non-fiction. Several of the works were co-authored with Laura Nelson Baker, with whom Stoutenburg lived. Stoutenburg also published under the pseudonyms Barbie Arden, Lace Kendall, and Nelson Minier (the latter jointly with Baker, e.g. The Lady in the jungle). At least five of Stoutenburg's books were Junior Literary Guild selections. Only one of her works, American Tall Tales, is currently in print; upon its publication in 1966, the New York Times included it on a listing of recommended volumes for children, summarizing it as \\"Eight tales, tough, sentimental, and bold, about American's folk heroes ...\\". Stoutenburg's first volume of poetry, Heroes, Advise Us, was the 1964 Lamont Poetry Selection of the Academy of American Poets; each year, this award honored and supported one poet's first published book. Her second collection, A Short History of the Fur Trade, won a California Book Award (silver) for 1969, and was a close competitor for the Pulitzer Prize. Her third collection, Greenwich Mean Time, was published in 1979. James Dickey has written of her poetry, \\"If I were to characterize the tone of voice, I would call it that of sensitive outrage, quivering, powerful, and delicate. Delicate: therefore powerful...\\" Stoutenburg died of cancer in 1982 in Santa Barbara, California. At Stoutenburg's request, David R. Slavitt subsequently edited and published a selection of her poetry. The volume, Land of Superior Mirages, includes a number of poems that had been unpublished at her death.

The car combined design elements from the company's past with a modern look, paying homage to the iconic BMW 507 (produced from 1956 to 1959). Fisker envisioned it as a 507 that evolved like the Porsche 911 has over its six decade model run.

It was announced in 2017, and the first test vehicle is projected to be running at a corporate campus in the US in 2019. Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for. In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expects the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times. In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials. In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster- Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models. On July 8, 2020, Fisker announced the completion of a $50 million Series C financing round funded by Moore Strategic Ventures, the private investment arm of Louis Bacon, with the proceeds to go toward engineering work on the Fisker Ocean all- electric luxury SUV. On July 13, 2020, Fisker announced that Fisker Inc. would offer an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp., which is backed by private equity firm Apollo Global Management. The deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020, values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10. On July 27, 2020, Fisker announced it was in advanced discussions with Extreme E, an all-electric off- road motor racing series, on a partnership, and potentially entering a works team in Extreme E's inaugural five-race 2021 season. On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles. Design philosophy Fisker describes his aesthetic as innovative and timeless. His designs are long and muscular, drawing inspiration from the human body as well as classic cars from the past. He is inspired by Italian car designs, as well as the American designs, in particular the luxury and muscle cars of the 1950s, '60s and '70s. He is highly concerned with proportion, designing his cars with flowing lines, short overhangs, and an assertive stance. In popular culture The Fisker-designed BMW Z8 was featured as the official car in the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough. The Fisker Karma was featured on Two and a Half Men starting in season 9 in 2011, as the car driven by Internet mogul Walden Schmidt, played by Ashton Kutcher.\\"The Fisker Karma: What Walden Schmidt drives,\\" CBS News, 2 March 2012. In the 2013 drama film Paranoia, a communications titan (played by Harrison Ford) gives his young associate (played by Liam Hemsworth) the keys to a brand new Fisker Karma as a symbol that he has \\"made it\\" in the corporate world.Bryan Alexander, \\"Fisker turns up in new Harrison Ford movie 'Paranoia',\\" USA Today, 15 October 2012. Controversies =Tesla Motors v. Fisker Coachbuild (2008)= An arbitrator ruled in favor of Fisker Coachbuild. On 14 April 2008, Tesla Motors filed a lawsuit against Fisker Coachbuild, Fisker and Koehler, contending that they had fraudulently agreed to a design contract in 2007 only to gain access to confidential information, before announcing a competing vehicle, the Fisker Karma. Both the Tesla and Fisker vehicles in question were designed as serial hybrid cars, with a gas engine powering a generator that charges a battery to power the electric motor, and both were initially planned for delivery in 2010. The lawsuit sought to prevent Fisker from using Tesla design documents, along with a return of the money from the Tesla contract, plus punitive damages.John Markoff, \\"Tesla Motors Files Suit Against Competitor Over Design Ideas,\\" New York Times, 15 April 2008. Fisker filed for arbitration in May 2008. An arbitrator ruled in their favor in November 2008, finding \\"overwhelming\\" evidence showing that Fisker did not do anything wrong.Martin LaMonica, \\"Tesla Motors loses trade secrets case against Fisker,\\" CNet, 4 November 2008. Subsequently, Tesla was ordered to pay $1.14 million in legal fees and costs to Fisker.John O’Dell, \\"Tesla Ordered To Pay Fisker $1.14 Million After Losing Trade Secrets Case,\\" Edmunds.com, 4 December 2008. =Fisker Automotive congressional hearing (2013)= Following his resignation from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, Fisker voluntarily testified on 24 April 2013, at a congressional hearing led by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the Department of Energy's $192 million disbursement to Fisker Automotive through the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program.\\"Testimony of Henrik Fisker,\\" oversight.house.gov, 24 April 2013. Fisker Automotive had failed earlier that week to meet the deadline for repayment on the loan, which was originally approved as a $529 million loan guarantee.Meg Handley, \\"House Republicans Slam Government 'Bet' on Fisker Automotive,\\" U.S. News & World Report, 25 April 2013. =Fisker v. Aston Martin (2015–16)= On 4 January 2016, Fisker filed a suit against two Aston Martin corporations and three executives for $100 million in damages for civil extortion, claiming that his former employer was trying to prevent him from unveiling his new luxury sports car hybrid, the VLF Force 1 V10, at the 2016 North American International Auto Show. The complaint claimed that after Fisker released a single pen-on-paper sketch of the Force 1 in December 2015, he received a letter from Aston Martin claiming the design was too similar to their DB10 and demanding that he either change the design or not display the car at the auto show. Aston Martin had previously sued Fisker in 2015 over his car design for the Thunderbolt. That case was settled after Fisker agreed not to move forward with the vehicle. Following the January 2016 auto show debut of the Force 1, it was clear that the vehicle was not similar to the DB10. Aston Martin subsequently stopped threatening to interfere with the development of the Force 1, and the matter was resolved in April 2016.William Fierman, \\"Legendary car designer Henrik Fisker just filed a $100 million lawsuit against Aston Martin,\\" Business Insider, 6 January 2016.

McCluskie was well known in Newton prior to the gunfight. Earlier that same year, he had been charged with garroting a man to death. Those charges were dismissed. Born and raised in Ohio, he made his way down into Kansas by way of employment with the Santa Fe Railroad, as a Night Policeman. He became the unofficial guardian of a young teenage man named James Riley, who was often seen in his presence, and who would eventually become the deciding factor in the gunfight. The gunfight The incident began with an argument between local lawman, Billy Bailey, and McCluskie, who had been employed as a policeman for the elections. The two men began arguing on August 11, 1871, over local politics on election day in the \\"Red Front Saloon\\", located in downtown Newton. The argument developed into a fist fight, with Bailey being knocked outside the saloon and into the street. McCluskie followed, drawing his pistol. He fired two shots at Bailey, hitting him with the second shot in the chest. Bailey died the next day, on August 12, 1871. McCluskie fled town to avoid arrest, but was only away for a few days before returning, after receiving information that the shooting would most likely be deemed self defense, despite the fact that Bailey never produced a weapon. McCluskie had claimed he feared for his life, having known that in three previous gunfights, Bailey had killed two men. Bailey, a native of Texas, had several cowboy friends who were in town. Upon hearing of his death, they vowed revenge against McCluskie. On August 19, 1871, McCluskie entered Newton and went to gamble at \\"Tuttles Dance Hall\\", located in an area of town called Hide Park. He was accompanied by a friend, Jim Martin. As McCluskie settled into gambling, three cowboys entered the saloon. They were Billy Garrett, Henry Kearnes, and Jim Wilkerson, all friends to Bailey. Billy Garrett had been in at least two prior gunfights, killing two men. Hugh Anderson, the son of a wealthy Bell County, Texas cattle rancher, also entered, and approached McCluskie, calling him a coward and threatening his life. Jim Martin jumped up and attempted to stop a fight from occurring. Anderson shot McCluskie in the neck, knocking him to the floor. McCluskie attempted to shoot Anderson, but his pistol misfired. Anderson then stood over him and shot him several times in the back. Kearns, Garrett, and Wilkerson also began firing, perhaps to keep the crowd back, and may have shot McCluskie in the leg. At that point James Riley, believed to have been 18 years of age at the time, opened fire on them. Riley was dying from tuberculosis, and had been taken in by McCluskie shortly after arriving in Newton. Riley had never been involved in a gunfight before, but only Anderson still had a loaded pistol to return fire. Some accounts say Riley locked the saloon doors before shooting, but this seems unlikely. The room was filled with smoke from all the prior gunfire, and visibility was bad. Riley ended up hitting seven men. Jim Martin, the would-be peacemaker, was shot in the neck and later died of his wound. Garrett, Kearns, and a bystander named Patrick Lee were also mortally wounded. Anderson, Wilkerson, and another bystander were wounded but survived. With both guns empty and all his opponents down, Riley walked away and was never seen again. A warrant was issued for Anderson for killing McCluskie. He left Kansas by train and settled in Texas to recover from his wounds. On July 4, 1873, McCluskie's brother, Arthur McCluskie, located Anderson. A brutal fight ensued with both men shooting each other several times, then going after each other with knives. Neither survived. Riley has been listed as a gunfighter in some historical accounts. He was mentioned in The Gunfighter-Man or Myth, by Joseph G. Rosa. However, there are no indications that he was ever in any other gunfights short of this one. Legend has it he left the area and began a new life elsewhere. However, due to his ill physical state, it is more likely he died not long afterward under an assumed name. Either way, he disappeared from historical record.

The museum has a wide-ranging collection, mainly of works produced locally. The collection of the paintings by the Northern Mannerist Joachim Wtewael is by a long way the largest anywhere in the world. Other highlights are many significant paintings by the Utrecht Caravaggisti, such as Gerard van Honthorst and Hendrick ter Brugghen. Both of them travelled to Rome in the early 17th century to study the works of the Italian master Caravaggio. In the previous generation, as well as Wtewael, Abraham Bloemaert and the portraitist Paulus Moreelse were the most significant Utrecht painters, with Jan van Scorel still earlier. History Initially, the collection - exhibited on the top floor of the Utrecht townhall - was limited to art related to the city of Utrecht. In 1921 the collection merged with various private collections in the new 'centralised museum' (hence the name 'Centraal museum', centraal being the Dutch word for central) located in the former medieval monastery at the Nicolaaskerkhof. Currently, the collection comprises pre-1850 art, modern art, applied art, fashion and the city history of Utrecht. Since 2006, the museum also runs the Miffy Museum, a museum across the street dedicated to Dick Bruna and his rabbit character Miffy. It also runs the Rietveld Schröder House, a famous Modernist house built in 1924 by the Dutch architect Gerrit Rietveld for Mrs. Truus Schröder- Schräder and her three children, which is now owned by the museum and open to the public (prebooking usually needed). Highlights Amongst the highlights of the museum is the one-thousand-year-old 'Utrecht Ship'. The ship is part of the collection 'Stadsgeschiedenis'. The ship was found in 1930 near the Van Hoornekade in Utrecht and was put in the cellar of the 16th-century part of the museum building.

Biography Hans Ehard was born in Bamberg in 1887, the son of a local official, August Ehard. He was married in 1916 to Annelore Maex. After his wife died in 1957, he married Sieglinde Odörfer in 1960. After studying jurisprudence in Munich and Würzburg Ehard became public prosecutor in the Bavarian Ministry of Justice in 1919. In this office, he was the main prosecutor of Hitler and Ludendorff in 1924, after their failed attempt to overthrow the Bavarian government in 1923. In 1933 he became President of the high court in Munich, a position he held until the end of the war. He sympathised with the Bavarian People's Party but was not politically active in those years. After the war, in 1945, he briefly served under Schäffer as Minister of Justice, later serving in Hoegner's first cabinet as undersecretary of state in the Ministry of Justice. He was a member of the constituent assembly, and was elected Minister President on 21 December 1946 with a coalition of CSU, SPD and the Economic Structure Combination (Wirtschaftliche Aufbau-Vereinigung). He became the first freely elected Bavarian prime minister since 1933. He was a member of the Bavarian Landtag from 1946 to 1966. When the SPD withdrew its Ministers from the coalition he was able to form a CSU-only government on 21 September 1947. During the formation years of the Federal Republic of Germany, he advocated a strongly federalist concept for the new country, in opposition to most of the SPD-ruled states, who wanted a strong central government.The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945-1990: A Handbook google book review, author: Detlef Junker, Philipp, publisher: Cambridge University Press, page 87, accessed: 9 May 2008 He also argued for a form of European federation.Documents on the history of European integration google book review, author: Walter Lipgens, Wilfried Loth, publisher: Walter de Gruyter, page 508, accessed: 9 May 2008 From 1949 to 1955 he was also chairman of the CSU. From 1954 to 1957, his party was in opposition to the SPD-lead coalition government. As of 2008, this three years were the CSU's only period outside of government. Ehard held in those years the position of President of the Landtag, from 1954 to 1960. Between 26 January 1960 to 11 December 1962 he again served as Minister President, stepping down to become Justice Minister, in which capacity he served until 5 December 1966 Ehard had been President of the Schutzgemeinschaft Deutscher Wald (SDW), an environmental charity, as well as of the Bavarian Red Cross. In 1957 he was made an honorary citizen of city of Munich, the British equivalent being Freedom of the City. Hans Ehard was the oldest former Minister-President of Germany from 9 June 1980 to November 1985, preceded by Wilhelm Kaisen and succeeded by Max Seydewitz. Counting only the Ministers-President of the FRG he was succeeded by Bruno Diekmann on 27 March 1990. He died in Munich. Plaque marking the house where Ehard was born.

It was her first U.S. release in 20 years and was recorded by LaVette with producer and songwriter Dennis Walker.  Critical reception  Allmusic's Hal Horowitz gave A Woman Like Me four out of five stars and called it \\"a powerful album — moving, intense, and honest\\". He found Dennis Walker's \\"heart-tugging yet defiant material\\" suited for LaVette, whose performance he compared to \\"Otis Redding at his most impassioned\\", and felt that her matured voice adds emotional depth. Q magazine gave it three stars and credited LaVette for \\"knocking the bejesus out of\\" the songs on a \\"tough-talking, bluesy\\" album. In its three-star review, Mojo found its stories of \\"broken hearts and promises\\" similar to Tennessee Williams and wrote that LaVette's vocals \\"remain remarkably untarnished by age\\".

Between 2006 and 2008 it was funded by a European Union research project of the same name that grouped together industrial and academic actors to develop various Semantic Desktop technologies.  Implementations  Three active implementations of NEPOMUK exist: A C++/KDE- based variant, a Java-based variant, and a commercial version. More versions were created during the EU project between 2006 and 2008, some active beyond the project.How Does Gnowsis Relate to NEPOMUK and Others? Blogpost dated 20.11.2010. Written by Leo Sauermann who contributed to the NEPOMUK project. 6 implementations of NEPOMUK are listed = KDE = NEPOMUK-KDE was originally featured as one of the newer technologies in KDE Software Compilation 4. It used Soprano as the main RDF data storage and parsing library, while handling ontology imports through the Raptor parser plugin and the Redland storage plugin; all RDF data was stored by Virtuoso which also handled full-text indexing. On a technical level, NEPOMUK-KDE allowed associating metadata to various items present on a normal user's desktop such as files, bookmarks, e-mails, and calendar entries. Metadata could be arbitrary RDF. Tagging is the most user-visible metadata application. As the KDE SC 4 series of releases progressed, it became apparent that NEPOMUK was not delivering the performance and user experience that had initially been anticipated. As a result of this, in KDE SC 4.13 a new indexing and semantic search technology Baloo was introduced, with a short transition period allowing applications to be ported and data to be migrated before the removal of NEPOMUK. Baloo initially used SQLite but currently uses LMDB for storage, and Xapian for searching. = Zeitgeist = The Zeitgeist framework, used by GNOME and Ubuntu's Unity user interface, uses the NEPOMUK ontology, as does the Tracker search engine. = Java = The Java-based implementation of NEPOMUK was finished at the end of 2008 and served as a proof-of-concept environment for several novel semantic desktop techniques. It features its own frontend (PSEW) that integrates search, browsing, recommendation, and peer-to-peer functionality. The Java implementation uses the Sesame RDF store and the Aperture framework for integrating with other desktop applications such as mail clients and browsers. A number of artifacts have been created in the context of the Java research implementation: * WikiModel = Refinder by Gnowsis = Implementation of the commercial Software as a service product Refinder started in 2009 and a limited beta-version was released in December 2010.Refinder: Das nächste Level des Hyperlinks Article in Futurezone by Jakob Steinschaden, 3.12.2010. Refinder was developed by Gnowsis, a spin-off company of the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) (project lead in the NEPOMUK EU project). The start-up was shut down in late 2013, with no plans to make the implementation code available.

In 1918 following the end of World War One, the territories of the former state re-emerged as the states of Poland and Lithuania among others. In the intervening period, the territory of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was split between the Austrian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Russian Empire. These powers subdivided the territories that they gained and created new toponyms for the territories conquered. The subdivisions created were complicated by changes within those empires as well as by the periodic establishment of other forms of the quasi- Polish provinces led by a foreign head of state. The below subdivisions do not cover the administrative divisions of the French vassal state created by Napoleon - the Duchy of Warsaw. See subdivisions of the Duchy of Warsaw (1807–1815). For the administrative division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth before its final third partition, see subdivisions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. For the subdivisions of the lands awarded to the Russian Empire, see subdivisions of Congress Poland (1815–1918) and History of the administrative division of Russia. For subdivisions of the lands awarded to the Kingdom of Prussia, see Provinces of Prussia. 524x524px Austrian Partition The Austrian Empire, known from second half of the 19th century as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, annexed territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the First Partition (1772) and the Third Partition (1795). The territories obtained were subdivided into: #Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. These lands were held from 1772 to 1918. #West Galicia (also known as New Galicia). These lands were held from 1795 to 1809. #Free City of Cracow. Administered as a protectorate by the three powers from 1815 to 1846. Annexed by the Austrian Empire in 1846 as the Grand Duchy of Cracow. While nominally independent within the crown lands, it was de facto administered as part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria until 1918. In the First Partition, the Austrian Empire received the largest share of the Polish population, and second largest land share (83,000 km² and over 2.65 million people). Austria did not participate in the Second partition. In the Third Partition, Austria annexed 47,000 km² of territories with 1.2 million people. Overall, Austria gained about 18 percent of the former Commonwealth's territory (130,000 km²) and about 32 percent of its population (3.85 million people). From the geographical perspective, much of the Austrian partition corresponded to the Galicia region. Territorial changes of Austrian Galicia, 1772-1918 Growth of Prussia. Yellow territories are the ones gained during partitions of Poland German Empire (1871-1918) Western governorates of the Russian Empire. Prussian Partition The Kingdom of Prussia (known from second half of the 19th century as German Empire) annexed territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in all three partitions. The territories obtained were subdivided into the following. #Netze District - from 1772 to 1793 #New Silesia - from 1795 to 1807 #New East Prussia - from 1795 to 1807 #South Prussia - from 1793 to 1806 #East Prussia - from 1773–1829 #West Prussia - from 1773–1824. In the First Partition, Prussia has received 36,000 km² and about 0.6 million people. In the second partition, Prussia had received 58,000 km² and about 1 million people. In the third, similar to the second, Prussia gained 55,000 km² and 1 million people. Overall, Prussia had gained about 20 percent of the former Commonwealth territory (149 000 km²) and about 23 percent of the population (2.6 million people). From the geographical perspective, much of the territories annexed by Prussia formed the province of Greater Poland (Wielkopolska). Russian Partition The Russian Empire which acquired the territories of the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia in all three Partitions, divided the former territories of the Commonwealth by either creating or enlarging the following guberniyas. # Belarus Governorate (1802) # Bratslav Governorate # Chernigov Governorate # Kiev Governorate (1708) # Lithuania Governorate (1795), later split into Lithuania-Grodno Governorate and Lithuania-Vilna Governorate, the last one later split into Vilna and Kovno Governorates # Minsk Governorate (1793) # Mogilev Governorate (1772) # Podolia Governorate (1773) # Polotsk Governorate # Pskov Governorate # Slonim Governorate (1795) (several months after creation connected to Lithuania Governorate in and split off from it in 1801 as Lithuania-Grodno Governorate) # Volhynia Governorate (1793) After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Russian Empire created a separate entity called Congress Poland out of some of the above governorates. See administrative division of Congress Poland for details. Territories in the Russian partition which were not incorporated into Congress Poland were known as the Western Krai (combination of Northwestern and Southwestern Krais), and in Poland as the taken lands (). The Western Krai comprised the following lands of the Commonwealth: # from the first partition of Poland (1772): Polish Inflants (Latgale), the northern part of the Polotsk Voivodeship, the entire Mstsislaw Voivodeship and Vitebsk Voivodeships, and the southeastern part of the Minsk Voivodeship (about 92,000 km²) # from the second partition of Poland (1793): the remaining part of the Minsk Voivodeship, the entire Kiev Voivodeship, Bracław Voivodeship and Vilnius Voivodeships, parts of Podole Voivodeship and eastern parts of the Wołyń Voivodeship and Brest Litovsk Voivodeships (about 250,000 km²) # from the third partition of Poland (1795): all the territories east of the Bug River(about 120,000. km²) and after 1807 the Belostok Oblast) It consisted of 9 guberniyas: six Belarusian and Lithuanian ones that constituted the Northwestern Krai (Vilna Governorate, Kovno Governorate, Grodno Governorate, Minsk Governorate, Mogilev Governorate and Vitebsk Governorate) and three Ukrainian ones that constituted the Southwestern Krai (Volhynia Governorate, Podolia Governorate and Kiev Governorate). The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was transformed into Courland Governorate (Government of Courland) and grouped with the Baltic governorates also known as Governments of Ostsee. In the first partition, Russia gained and 1.3 million people. In the second, 250,000 km² and 1 million people. In the third, 120,000 km² and 1.2 million people. Overall, Russia had gained about 62 percent of the former Commonwealth territory (462,000 km²) and about 45 percent of the population (3.5 million people). During World War I (1914–1918), much of the territories became occupied by the Central Powers (primarily, German Empire) and became administered by the Ober Ost.

The lighthouse is situated on a rocky skerry, which is elevated a maximum of 16 metres above the Baltic Sea. History The first lighthouse on this islet was built in 1808. That construction was a brick building, chalked in white, about five metres high, with a lanternine on its top. The light source was modernized in 1866, and it was also raised to an elevation of eight metres. The lighthouse was given a third class lens system and a clockwork which rotated an oil lamp with a double wick. This gave the lighthouse beacon a reddish gloom. The lighthouse men lived along with their families in a wooden house next to the lighthouse. A fog horn was constructed at the other end of the island by the beginning of the 20th century. The Imperial Russian Army began constructing defense works on this island when World War I erupted, but these were never completed. In 1918, Finnish maritime authorities manned the lighthouse. The old lighthouse was destroyed before the Winter War of 1939-40 and the personnel were evacuated. On New Year's Eve of 1941 a Finnish force of about 100 men was stationed at the island since it had a strategic position. The Soviet Union also wanted to possess the islet, and on 8 July 1942 it attacked the islet with several small warships and aircraft. The Soviets creates a foothold on the eastern extent of the island, but due to artillery support from the Finnish islet of Ulko-Tammio (about 19 kilometres northwest of Sommers) the Finns drove the Soviets away on 9 July 1942. After the 1944 peace treaty between Finland and the Soviet Union, the island of Sommers was given to the Soviets, who also constructed a new truss lighthouse. Its focal plane is situated about 57 metres above sea level. Its light characteristic is \\"Fl(2) 10s\\", i.e. a group of two flashing lights about every ten seconds. There are also a number of buildings and radar masts on the island, probably to keep an eye on the increasingly busy shipping traffic in the area.

Steere Elementary School, formerly Broadmoor School, is an elementary school located at 4009 Youree Drive in Shreveport, Louisiana, and operated under the direction of the Caddo Parish school board. History It opened its doors Oct. 29, 1929 as the new Broadmoor School, previously located at 305 Albany Ave. The new school housed 225 students and 12 teachers. The school flower was the yellow and green dandelion, which is believed to be the source of the school's colors. In the mid-1920s, A.C. Steere donated 12–17 acres of land in Broadmoor for schools and recreational parks. Following his death in 1930, the Broadmoor School was renamed in honor of the man whose contributions made it possible. The east wing, with four classrooms and a central office was added to the original school structure in 1939. In 1954, A.C. Steere's enrollment topped out at 1,078 with classes housed in permanent classrooms, temporary buildings and borrowed space from Broadmoor Baptist Church. Renovations and additions in 2010 updated the campus structures, with a central air and heating system and new Library/Media Center. Also in 2010, the title to the domed gymnasium that formerly belonged to Shreveport Parks and Recreation was accepted by Caddo Parish School Board and became a permanent part of the school campus. Sixth-grade classes were moved to Broadmoor Junior High in 1982. On Dec. 3, 1936, the A.C. Steere Parent Teacher Association was chartered under the Louisiana Parent Teacher Association, which was then a branch of the National Congress of Parents and Teachers. In 2011, the PTA will celebrated its Diamond Anniversary, 75 years as a unit in good standing. It is the longest standing active elementary school PTA unit in Caddo Parish. Programs introduced to the school through PTA efforts include Accelerated Reader, Watch DOGS and National Elementary Honor Society. On Feb. 20, 1991, A.C.

He had earlier claimed the Roberts Baronetcy of 1620. Jane Roberts, only daughter of the sixth Baronet of the 1620 creation, married George Beauclerk, 3rd Duke of St Albans. In circa 1775 she believed that she had discovered the descendants of Thomas, second son of the second Baronet, who lived at Britfieldstown in County Cork, Ireland, and the baronetcy was assumed by the head of that family, Randal Roberts. In 1809 a new patent was passed in favour of his son, the aforementioned Thomas.

Early life Dukakis was born John Chaffetz in San Jose, California but reared in the Boston area. He is the son of Kitty Dukakis and John Chaffetz, a businessman, and the adopted son of former Massachusetts Governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, whom his mother married when he was five. His half-brother, through his biological father, is Jason Chaffetz, who was the U.S. Representative (R) for Utah's 3rd district from 2009 to 2017.  Acting career  While attending Brown University in the 1970s, Dukakis was cast in Universal's Jaws 2. He relocated to Hollywood and continued to work as an actor for the next 6 years. He had substantial roles in the films Making Love, Delusion and Split Image and on television in Family Ties, Little House on the Prairie, Taxi and the Jim Jones docudrama, Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones. He finished his career in New York working on the Broadway and Off-Broadway stage. Political career After retiring from acting, he secured a job in Washington, D.C., as a legislative assistant to U.S. Senator John Kerry in Kerry's first two years in office. In 1987, when Michael Dukakis announced his intention to run for President of the United States, John left Washington and moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to run the Southern campaign for the months prior to the Super Tuesday primaries. Later, as the Democratic National Political Director, he campaigned nationally on behalf of the unsuccessful Dukakis–Bentsen ticket. Music industry With the 1988 campaign over, John began work with an attorney in Boston named Bob Woolf who had built a significant international practice representing professional athletes. John ran the music business management department and spent most of his time on a developing local act: New Kids on the Block. Within several years the company grew and he was sent to Los Angeles to open an office there with an emphasis on working with other established and developing acts. When he left the company in 1992, the company was also working with Boyz II Men and Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. Dukakis left Bob Woolf to become the general manager of Paisley Park Records, a joint venture between the artist Prince and Warner Bros. Records. During his tenure, the company released a Prince album as well as projects from George Clinton and Mavis Staples. In 1994, he formed a new venture with his partner, Qadree El-Amin. Southpaw Entertainment was a full service management company. In its early years it primarily focused on the management of Boyz II Men. But after the record-setting success of the 12X platinum \\"II\\" album, the company took on new clients. Over the years, Southpaw also handled the careers of Janet Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Brownstone and Blackstreet. In early 2002, Dukakis left Southpaw to take a position as an Executive Vice President of Overbrook Music, a music label as well as a full service management company owned and operated by Will Smith and his partner, James Lassiter.

She served in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean and provided destroyer escort protection against submarine and air attack for Navy vessels and convoys. She was named in honor of Ensign James Wallace Haverfield, USNR, who was killed aboard the battleship during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. She was launched 30 August 1943 by Brown Shipbuilding Co., Houston, Texas; sponsored by Mrs. George Tracy (Bessie) Haverfield, mother of Ensign Haverfield; and commissioned 29 November, Lieutenant Commander Jerry A. Matthews in command. World War II North Atlantic operations After shakedown in the Caribbean, Haverfield joined the escort aircraft carrier 's hunter-killer (HUK)http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/history/cold-war- asw.html group in patrolling Atlantic convoy lanes in search of marauding German U-boats. Departing Norfolk, Virginia, 26 February 1944, the hunter- killer group, aided by a Canadian corvette and British aircraft, sank the on the 23rd of March. With some seven survivors of the U-boat aboard, Haverfield continued her patrol to Casablanca, where she reported to Commander Moroccan Sea Frontier and turned over the German prisoners 18 March. After returning to Norfolk, Haverfield sailed on her second offensive combat cruise with the Bogue HUK group on 5 May. Operating with another HUK group under the escort carrier , the Bogue force sank the , ex-, at on 13 May as the former German ship was heading for her new home in Japan. Sinking of the Block Island Reaching Casablanca 29 May, Haverfield was ordered out that same night to render emergency assistance to survivors of carrier Block Island, sunk by a German torpedo off the Canary Islands. Haverfield rescued one of six Block Island fighter pilots who had been aloft when the carrier sank, but a long search failed to locate the remaining five men. End-of-European-war activity After this, Haverfield continued to operate until the European War ended in May 1945 on transatlantic antisubmarine hunter-killer missions as well as on patrol along the icy Great Barrier. When all German U-boats still at sea had been accounted for, the destroyer escort underwent an overhaul at Boston, Massachusetts, and, after intensive training in Cuban waters, sailed for the Pacific via the Panama Canal on 19 July 1945 to be ready for the invasion of Japan. Transfer to the Pacific Fleet Reaching Pearl Harbor via the Panama Canal and San Diego, California on 1 August 1945, Haverfield was in port at Pearl Harbor when the war ended in mid-August and at the end of the month assumed convoy escort duty from Saipan to Okinawa. She patrolled the China coast and then streamed her homeward-bound pennant, reaching Boston on 15 February 1946. Haverfield then sailed to Naval Station Green Cove Springs, Florida, 25 March 1946, was decommissioned and went into reserve with that installation's reserve fleet located on the St. Johns River on 30 June 1947. Converted to radar picket ship Reclassified DER-393 in September 1954, Haverfield was relocated from the Green Cove Springs Reserve Fleet to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, converted to a radar picket ship, and recommissioned there on 4 January 1955. Fitted with the latest electronic detection equipment and with 50 tons of ballast in her keel to compensate for the topside weight of the new radar antennae, Haverfield trained off the East Coast of the United States and then reported to her new home port, Seattle, Washington, via the Panama Canal and San Diego, California on 23 July 1955. Haverfield served as flagship of the newly created Escort Squadron FIVE (CORTON 5) in addition to regular radar picket patrol off the Pacific coast. After five years of this duty, she reported to Pearl Harbor on 10 April 1959 for similar employment along the Pacific Barrier. Departing Pearl Harbor on 16 May 1960, Haverfleld sailed to a new homeport of Apra Harbor, Guam, to conduct surveillance in the vicinity of the Trust Territory Islands and to ensure the safety and welfare of the islanders. Supporting President Eisenhower and bathyscaphe Trieste After participating in Operation Cosmos, which provided navigational aids for and was prepared to render emergency assistance to President Dwight D. Eisenhower's plane as the Chief Executive crossed the Pacific Ocean on a goodwill tour, Haverfield operated with the famed bathyscaphe Trieste as it descended the Mariana Trench to a near-record dive, of on 30 June 1960. Supporting various causes Following her support of this scientific endeavor, Haverfield conducted antisubmarine and search and rescue patrols among the Bonins, the Marianas, and the Caroline Islands. For almost five years she served primarily in the Trust Territory of the Pacific, though twice she deployed to the Far East. Steaming to Japan in October 1960, she became the first radar picket escort ship to operate with the U.S. 7th Fleet in the Western Pacific. In mid-October 1961 she returned to the Far East; and, upon relieving on patrol in the Formosa Strait, she became the first of her type to join in this important peace-keeping operation. She continued intermittent patrols off Taiwan until 10 January 1962 when she steamed via Japan to resume patrol duty out of Guam. In November 1961, Typhoon Karen left widespread destruction on Guam and Haverfield, the first ship to return to storm-wracked Apra Harbor, provided valuable supplies and services in the relief and recovery effort. Vietnam operations Haverfield returned to Pearl Harbor March 1965 and, after joining Escort Squadron 5, sailed on 19 June 1965 for duty off of South Vietnam. There she participated in Operation Market Time patrols to guard against the infiltration of North Vietnamese troops and supplies to Viet Cong irregulars in South Vietnam by sea. She served on \\"Market Time\\" station for seven months, then returned to Pearl Harbor on 2 February 1966. Departing for the Far East 23 May, she resumed \\"Market Time\\" operations on 9 June. Eleven days later, she participated in the most significant action of the operation up to that time. A , steel-hulled North Vietnamese trawler , attempting to infiltrate \\"Market Time\\" patrols with a large cargo of arms and ammunition for the Viet Cong, was detected by near the mouth of the Cổ Chiên River in the Mekong Delta. A chase and fire fight followed, during which the Coast Guard cutter forced the enemy trawler aground and the enemy abandoned the burning ship. After wiping out enemy shore resistance, \\"Market Time\\" units, including Haverfield, sent volunteers on board to fight fires and salvage the captured cargo. While American and South Vietnamese teams extinguished the fires, other volunteers offloaded almost 80 tons of ammunition and arms, including mortars, recoilless rifles, machine guns, and antitank weapons. This represented the largest seizure of the \\"Market Time\\" operation and thwarted a determined attempt by the North Vietnamese to supply the Viet Cong. Haverfield continued \\"Market Time\\" patrols during the next five months. In addition, she provided naval gunfire support on 6 September against an enemy on Phu Quoc Island, South Vietnam. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 6 December 1966, remained there until late April 1967, and then resumed patrol duty off South Vietnam. Final Decommissioning Haverfield was decommissioned on 2 June 1969 at Naval Base Pearl Harbor. On 2 June 1969 she was struck from the Navy list and on sold for scrapping 15 December 1971 to Chi Shun Hua Steel Co. Ltd. of Kaoshiung, Taiwan for $35,000.00. Awards For her participation in World War II, Haverfield was awarded one battle star as well as the Presidential Unit Citation, the American Campaign Medal, the European-African-Middle East Campaign Medal with 1 bronze star (2 awards) and the World War II Victory Medal for her antisubmarine work in the Atlantic. She was also awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with one silver star (6 awards), the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross (palm) Unit Citation (2 awards), and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal for her Cold War and Vietnam War service.http://www.navsource.org/archives/06/393.htm See also * List of United States Navy ships * World War II * Destroyer escort References External links * James Wallace Haverfield * NavSource Online: Destroyer Escort Photo Archive - USS Haverfield (DE-393) Category:Edsall-class destroyer escorts Category:World War II frigates and destroyer escorts of the United States Category:Ships built in Houston Category:1943 ships ","title":"USS Haverfield (DE-393)"},{"id":"12251089","text":"Stanley Clarence Harland (19 June 1940 – 30 August 2001) was an English football centre half. Career Born in Liverpool, Harland's football career began at local club New Brighton. It was from here that he attracted interest from Everton who signed him in 1959. Harland moved to Bradford City where he scored 20 goals in 120 league games for the club before being transferred to Carlisle United. Carlisle won promotion to the Second Division in his first season with the club, Harland played in every game. The arrival of Gordon Marsland saw him lose his first team place and he asked for a transfer. Harland signed for Swindon Town on 29 July 1966, the day before England beat West Germany in the World Cup Final at Wembley, after Swindon manager Danny Williams and chief scout Jack Conley sat outside Carlisle's ground (Brunton Park) overnight to make sure of his signature. Harland debuted for the team in the first game of the 1966–67 season against Brighton and Hove Albion, a 2–2 draw. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–3 defeat to Walsall the following season and was voted 1967-68 Player of the Season. His partnerships with Mel Nurse and later Frank Burrows helped Swindon to reach their successes of the 1960s, forming an effective defence. Harland became team captain on Nurse's departure in 1968 after being ever-present in the first team since his début. As captain, he received the League Cup after defeating Arsenal at Wembley Stadium in 1969. Harland lost his captaincy and position to Dave Mackay when he joined Swindon in 1971, manager Fred Ford gave him the role of auxiliary defender but Harland was dropped from the team when Mackay took over Coaching of the club as player-manager. His last game for Swindon was a win away at Burnley on 27 November 1971, he assisted the team in ending a six-game run without a victory. Even though he was named Man of the Match, he was sold to Birmingham City for £15,000. Harland made 38 appearances for Birmingham, helping them win promotion to the First Division in 1972 and reach the FA Cup semi-final of the same year. His career was ended through injury although he moved to become player-manager of Yeovil Town and later worked with Frank Burrows at Portsmouth in a coaching capacity. Harland was married to an ice- dancing champion and had two daughters, he also often played in the Professional Footballers' Golf Championship. After leaving football he worked in the Supermarket business and continued working up until his death from a heart attack on 30 August 2001 in Tintinhull, Somerset.

Passengers board from the left platform, and alight in the middle island. In railway and rapid transit parlance, the Spanish solution is a station layout with two railway platforms, one on each side of the track. This platform arrangement allows the separation of passenger streams by using one platform only for boarding and the other one only for alighting. The concept of separate platforms for boarding and alighting has been proven effective at stations with high passenger numbers. Examples The term \\"Spanish solution\\" derives from its use in several stations of the Madrid Metro (e.g. Avenida de América) and Barcelona Metro (e.g. Sant Andreu).

History  Following the passage of Proposition 13 in June 1978, anti-tax activist Howard Jarvis founded an organization called the California Tax Reduction Movement. The goals of this organization were to protect Proposition 13 and further the \\"taxpayer revolt.\\"Fox, Joel (2003). The Legend of Proposition 13. p. 53. Upon Jarvis's death in 1986, his former personal assistant, Joel Fox, took over as the organization's head, formally incorporating and changing its name to Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association.  Mission  The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association is known for its strong support of Proposition 13, which was approved by California voters in June 1978. Proposition 13 significantly limited real property tax increases for California homeowners and businesses. The association opposes taxes on California persons and businesses. Its motto, \\"Dedicated to protecting Proposition 13 and promoting taxpayers' rights\\", expresses its primary mission of defending Proposition 13. It mobilizes its members to support or oppose legislation, including ballot initiatives. It also endorses candidates in California elections and, through its separate campaign committees, is a source of campaign funds for the elections of candidates and ballot measures in California. = California Commentary = Starting in 2003, the association began distributing a weekly opinion piece known as California Commentary.  Joel Fox Presidency  Joel Fox, who had been a senior aide to Howard Jarvis, was the first president of the association, and served until the end of 1998.Fox, Joel (2003). The Legend of Proposition 13. p. 12. Joel Fox led the association into what observers have described as one of the most politically powerful organizations in California. = Notable events = Notable events during Joel Fox's presidency include:  Nordlinger v. Hahn Legal Challenge to Proposition 13  Fox guided the association against a successful legal challenge to Proposition 13 that landed before the United States Supreme Court. The case, known as Nordlinger v. Hahn, involved the issue of whether Proposition 13's reassessment scheme violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. On June 18, 1992, the court held that Proposition 13's acquisition-value assessment scheme does not violate the federal Equal Protection Clause.Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1 (1992). When the court agreed to hear the Nordlinger case, Fox said the case was \\"life or death for Proposition 13.\\" Fox also said:  Proposition 218 (1996)  In 1996, Fox led Proposition 218 (\\"Right To Vote On Taxes Act\\"), sponsored by the association, as a constitutional follow-up to Proposition 13. During the November 1996 election, California voters approved the Proposition 218 initiative constitutional amendment. Proposition 218 established constitutional limits on the ability of local governments to levy benefit assessments on real property and property-related fees and charges.Cal. Const., art. XIII D. Proposition 218 also requires voter approval before a local government can impose, increase, or extend any local tax.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 2. Proposition 218 also constitutionally reserves to local voters the right to use the initiative power to reduce or repeal any local tax, assessment, fee or charge.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 3. The Proposition 218 constitutional amendment is the only successful statewide ballot initiative sponsored by the association since its formation in 1989.

In the background is the Monte Vettore (2478m). Geography The village lies at 1452 m, making it the highest settlement in the Apennines. It lies above the \\"Great Plain\\" (Piano Grande - 1270 m), next to the Monti Sibillini National Park. Rain and meltwater accumulate on the surface of the plain, which is made of largely impermeable sediments. The greenish ditches drain the water towards openings called ponors, which are part of the karstic underground drainage system. If the karst drainage is blocked for any reason, water backs up and turns the plain into a temporary lake. History The village dates from the 13th century or slightly earlier, but the area had previously been settled by the Romans.http://www.castellucciodinorcia.it/italiano/storia.htm In 2016 and 2017 Central Italy seismic events hit Castelluccio hard, destroying roughly 60% of the town, forcing the evacuation of all inhabitants and the total closure of all road and/or offroad access. Certain roads were scheduled for partial reopening in July 2017. As of 2018, the village can be reached again, and temporary buildings have been erected housing bars and shops. Economy The fields on the slopes below the village are cultivated; the town is known for its excellent lentils. In springtime the nature of the fields is in lavish color, with red poppies and yellow rapeseed. The plains grassland is ideal for sheep husbandry. There is a lot of ski- and trekking tourism.

After a year, they resumed the Top 20, this time, acquiring only one hour, since not all videos from the Top 20 were shown. =Affiliations= The MTV Asia Hitlist is based on viewers' requests, album and singles sales, radio airplay and music downloads.http://www.ipod.com Determining the singles that enter the Top 20 is in cooperation of the record labels and companies, Nielsen Soundscan, and the Asian 100 Singles Airplay. In Asia, the MTV Network works in cooperation with extensive research from local MTV stations like MTV Indonesia, MTV India, MTV Philippines, MTV Mainland China, and MTV Japan. Policies Policies in the Asia Hitlist have been made in accordance to charting songs in the countdown. Several songs may have been given consideration due to its extreme reception in the Asian market. Various reasons for charting songs have special cases, and are deliberated by the makers of the MTV Asia Hitlist. =Multiple Entries= Artists may have multiple entries in the chart, and may occupy the top positions at the same time, which happened in 2002, where the Top 3 songs in one week were all of Mandy Moore's songs from her movie \\"A Walk to Remember.\\" \\"Cry,\\" \\"Someday We'll Know,\\" and \\"Only Hope\\" occupied the Top 3 positions in May 2002, and all songs were able to top the charts, earning Moore her first three #1 singles. =Scope Release= Regardless of the scope of release, Asia was exempted from US and UK release. One example is \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" and \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\" by Britney Spears. \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" was released in the UK and other parts of the globe except for the US, while \\"From The Bottom Of my Broken Heart\\" was only released in the US. In the Asia Hitlist, both singles charted with the former topping the chart for 2 weeks, and the latter peaking at #2. =Double-sided Releases= Double-sided releases were not considered to be a major factor in Asian releases. It was noted that each of the singles chart differently, since both songs totally differed from another. One example is the double-sided single \\"Mama\\" and \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\" by the Spice Girls. Considered a double-sided single in the UK, it charted in the Asia Hitlist as two different entries, with each video justifying its eligibility to chart. However, in the case of Mariah Carey's \\"Always Be My Baby,\\" which was double-sided with \\"Slipping Away,\\" the former charted as the official release excluding the latter from gaining popularity. \\"Always Be My Baby\\" became Carey's #1 hit while \\"Slipping Away\\" was disregarded and was not released. =Video Accompaniment= Charting songs have been completely eligible when there is an accompanying music video, which is used for commercial release. The first song to chart without a commercial video release was \\"Incomplete\\" by Sisqo, his second number one. The single didn't have an accompanying video for a release, but eight weeks later after charting, an official video was released. The song was not aired during the period wherein there was no accompanying video, and a picture of Sisqo was shown during recaps of the countdown. It was only after it fell from the top spot that that video was released, thus the airplay of the song was eligible.http://www.mtv.com =Remixes= In the early years of the Hitlist, remixes were eligible to chart if it was a dance remix or \\"radio\\" mix of an album's cut. It means that a remix's eligibility to chart depends entirely on the original version, since both versions are credited as one. The more popular the remix is, the higher the chart position. In 1999, Mariah Carey's single \\"I Still Believe\\" came out with a remix featuring Da Brat and Krayzie Bone entitled \\"I Still Believe/Pure Imagination.\\" Since it was an entirely different track from the original, it was considered to chart as a different entry. Conflict arose with her next remixes for singles \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Thank God I Found You,\\" which the former was said to be based on the original version, and the latter to only adapt the chorus of the original version as an adlib. \\"Thank God I Found You\\" was given an exception, since the remix version was entirely of a different structure and it no longer resembled the original recording. The same trend followed in the 2000s, wherein Jennifer Lopez' remixes for \\"I'm Real\\" and \\"Ain't It Funny\\" topped the chart. Both the original versions of the song were able to chart during its release, but their follow-up remixes were of higher popularity and airplay. \\"Ain't It Funny\\" peaked at #10 and one year later, the remix version topped the charts. The original version of \\"I'm Real\\" also topped the charts in 2001, and when sales started to decline, the remix version was released and was enabled to chart as a different single. This made history as \\"I'm Real\\" became the first song with both the original version and remix version staying at the chart at the same time, as well as both versions being able to top the charts as well. An arising conflict fell once again when Britney Spears released \\"Overprotected\\" in 2002. In January, the album version (or more commonly known as the \\"International Version\\") of the song was released and peaked at #3. After \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,\\" which topped the charts that year, the \\"Darkchild Remix\\" was released in the US. Considering that the song resembled the original structure and melody of the song, it was at first, prohibited to chart. The video was extensively played on MTV Non-Stop Hits, but never charted. Extreme airplay and viewer requests increased at the hype of the video's popularity, giving it enough points to break in the Top 20. Considering the fact that it was a North American release, and the song was commercially viable, it was finally enabled to chart. Surprisingly, the song peaked #2, one notch higher than the placement of its original version. Spears became the second artist (and the third instance) to which both the original version and remix version were able to chart in the countdown. =Edited Videos= Video editing has been the most controversial act imposed by MTV Asia. It rarely happens but once it is imposed on a video, it is never revoked. Videos are edited for several reasons. Nudity, explicit viewing content, and violence are certain examples of reasons for editing videos. The first video to be edited was \\"Thank U\\" by Alanis Morissette. In the video, Alanis is nude, but her private parts aren't shown in the video. However, this has been marred too explicit especially to the younger generation, and other religious sects in Asia. An edited version of the video was released, covering almost the whole screen except for Morissette's face. \\"Thank U\\" topped the chart in early 1999. Another video that was edited is George Michael's \\"Outside.\\" Due to its sexual content, it was never fully shown on MTV. Even when it charted, only about 57 seconds of the video were shown due to enormous sexual content. The most controversial video to have been extensively edited by the network was \\"Dirrty\\" by Christina Aguilera. In the part where Aguilera is in a boxing ring with her dancers at the beginning, a Thai poster is situated at the background while the dance is shown. Depicted in Thai language in the poster were the words \\"Thai Sex Tourism\\" and \\"Young Underage Girls.\\" The video was banned in Thailand but in other parts of Asia, the dance sequence in the beginning were shortened. A live version of the video was mostly played. Regardless of the video's limited release, the song still topped the charts. After the video for \\"Dirrty,\\" Aguilera drew more controversy with her next single \\"Beautiful\\". In the video, two men were seen kissing each other and were deemed too racy for MTV viewers. Again, MTV Asia edited the video by completely removing the gay scenes out of the video. \\"Beautiful\\" became her next number one single and the edited version was played throughout MTV Asia.

The resolution was declared at the Bidadari PoW camp in Singapore during Japanese occupation of the island. Fall of Singapore The fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942 brought under the Japanese occupation approximately 45,000 Indian PoWs. The surrender of these PoWs were accepted by Major Fujiwara Iwaichi, separately from that of British PoWs, on the morning of 17th at Farrer Park. Fujiwara passed on their command to Mohan Singh, who had formulated the conception of a liberation army for India's Independence, accepted their command and invited the PoWs to join his proposed army. A large number of the troops volunteered. Following this, the plans to formally establish the Indian National Army as the armed unit of the Indian Independence League were started. However, officers within the Indian Pow sought to establish clearly the Japanese intentions and designs for the army and clarification of its goals. Bidadary resolution In April 1942, even as the discussions and the process of setting up the Indian Independence League and defining the aims of the movement carried on, Mohan Singh convened a meeting of a group of his officers to frame what has now come to be known as the Bidadary resolution. The resolution, declared by Mohan Singh Deb, announced that: The resolution further specified that the army would go to battle only when the Congress and the people of India asked it to. It did not however, specify the how army was to interact with the Japanese forces. Effects of the resolution Following the Bidadari resolutions, the Indian PoW camps were dissolved and the staff were transferred to the INA supreme command under Mohan Singh. On 9 May, recruiting for the INA began. Mohan Singh had copies of the resolution circulated among the Indian jawans, followed by tours of the mainland camps by Mohan Singh and Fujiwara to encourage the troops to join the INA. In June, a conference was held in Bangkok that saw the proclamation of the Indian Independence League and clearly established the relationship between the INA and the Japanese army and established the IIL as the master organisation of which the INA was to be the armed wing of. The Bidadary resolutions therefore formed the basis on which the subsequent organisations and orders of the first INA was built. Notes References * . *.

He is the director and editor-in-chief of Chax Press, one of the only independent presses which specializes in innovative poetry and the book arts. Alexander also served as the Director of the Minnesota Center for the Book Arts from 1993 until 1995, and as book artist there through 1996. Alexander lives in Tucson, AZ with his wife the visual artist Cynthia Miller and his two daughters. He is the recipient of the 2006 Arizona Arts Award. Alexander and the Poet/Printer Tradition Alexander's ongoing work with Chax Press is informed by a tradition of poet/printers that includes William Blake, William Morris, and Robert Creeley. He learned many fine arts bookmaking techniques studying with Walter Hamady at the University of Wisconsin Department of Fine Arts in Madison, Wisconsin during the late seventies and early eighties, a time of particular ferment in the book arts, whose culminating moment was the presentation of Breaking the Bindings: American Book Art Now by the Elvehjem Museum in Madison. This was the first museum-scale book arts exhibition in the United States; Alexander was the lead writer on a team that wrote the introduction to the exhibition catalogue. Publications Alexander's books of poetry include Hopeful Buildings (Chax Press, 1990), arc of light  dark matter (Segue Books, 1992), Pushing Water: parts one through six (Standing Stones Press, Morris, MN, 1998), Pushing Water: part seven (Chax Press, Tucson),Four Ninety Eight to Seven (Meow Press, 1996), Etudes: D & D (Quarry Press, 1997), near or random acts (Singing Horse Press, 2004), and Certain Slants (Junction Press, 2007). He is also the editor of an important collection of essays on the book arts that emanated from the symposium Art & Language: Re-Reading the Book Arts, that he organized for Minnesota Center for the Book Arts in 1994. The book was titled Talking the Boundless Book. Alexander is an eclectic poet whose influences include b.p.nichol, Edward Dorn, Paul Metcalf, Hannah Weiner, Stan Brakhage, Ronald Johnson, and especially the Black Mountain poets Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, and Robert Creeley. Since 1997 he has been working on a long serial poem entitled Pushing Water which is still in process. Teaching and Performance Alexander has given readings, lectures, and workshops at colleges, universities, art centers, and other locations, including the Univ. of Alabama, the Univ. of Arizona, the State Univ. of New York at Buffalo, Small Press Traffic in San Francisco, Canessa Gallery in San Francisco, the University of Washington, Pacific Lutheran Univ. in Tacoma, Denver Univ., Scottsdale Center for the Arts, Toronto (Canada) Art Studio, and more. Alexander has also performed poetry in galleries and art centers, has collaborated with musicians and dancers, and in general brings to poetry a broad sense of artistic and collaborative possibility. Such collaborations include a poem/visual art mark commissioned by the Phoenix Public Library, created with artist Cynthia Miller; and collaborations on several projects with Orts Theater of Dance, including Urban Gaits and Balanced Edge. His poem, Aviary Corridor, set to music for string quartet, piano, flute, and soprano voice by the American composer Tim Risher, premiered at the University of Washington in April 2007, with Alexander as writer/artist in residence. He read for the Double Change series in Paris in June 2007 and participated in the Paris TAMAAS Poetry Translation Seminar. Alexander is a part-time faculty member at Naropa University's Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics in Boulder, Colorado, Pima Community College and the University of Arizona Poetry Center.

Pharmacologically, it is a phenol-based TAAR1 agonist and β adrenoreceptor agonist that stimulates β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors. It is most commonly administered to animals for meat production as ractopamine hydrochloride. It is the active ingredient in products marketed in the US as Paylean for swine, Optaflexx for cattle, and Topmax for turkeys. It was developed by Elanco Animal Health, a division of Eli Lilly and Company. As of 2014 the use of ractopamine was banned in 160 countries, including the European Union, mainland China and Russia, while 27 other countries, such as Japan, the United States, South Korea, and New Zealand have deemed meat from livestock fed ractopamine safe for human consumption.AIT- American Institute in Taiwan: 'The Facts about U.S. Beef and Ractopamine' (archived) Accessed January 21, 2018 Commercial ractopamine is a mixture of all four possible stereoisomers. It is also a positional isomer of dobutamine, a related drug. Mode of action When used as a food additive, ractopamine added to feed can be distributed by the blood to the muscle tissues, where it serves as a full agonist to murine TAAR1 (not necessarily human). It is also an agonist to beta-adrenergic receptors. A cascade of events will then be initiated to increase protein synthesis, which results in increased muscle fiber size. Ractopamine is known to increase the rate of weight gain, improve feed efficiency, and increase carcass leanness in finishing swine. Its use in finishing swine yields about of additional lean pork and improves feed efficiency by 10%. In cattle on 28 January 2004 Elanco Animal Health made Optaflexx commercially available in the US. Optaflexx is a \\"medicated feed additive that is labeled only for use in steers or market heifers (not breeding heifers or bulls) during the last 28-42 days on feed.\\" Regulation around the world On 6 July 2012, the international reference standard Codex Alimentarius Commission narrowly approved the adoption of an maximum residue limit (MRL) of 10 parts per billion (ppb) for muscle cuts of beef and pork. Setting any limit was a controversial move. Countries with major meat export markets had been lobbying for the establishment of such a standard for several years to use it as leverage to erode individual national-level bans in World Trade Organization disputes. Consumers International, a world federation of consumer groups that represents 220 consumer organizations in 115 countries, strongly opposed the move. Ractopamine use in food animals is banned in over 160 countries.Russian Ban On Ractopamine Boosts Brazilian Exports Simon Quilty, Beefmagazine (Penton), March 27, 2013 Because the traditional Chinese diet embraces pig offal, and because ractopamine is concentrated by the gastro-intestinal system of animals, Chinese officials have banned ractopamine. Other countries in Asia, whose traditional diet is similar to that of the Chinese, have had similar thoughts but the American use of tied trade access as a proxy for conflict has somewhat mitigated their reactions, as seen below. ;European Union Ractopamine has not been allowed in the European Union, based on the 2009 EU's Food Safety Authority's opinion on its safety evaluation, which concluded that available data were insufficient to derive a maximum residue limit as a 'safe residue level for human consumption'. The uncertainty was particularly great for people who might be thought to be more susceptible than most to an increase in β adrenergic stimulation from consuming the additive, such as people with cardiovascular disease or children, and that simply increasing the \\"uncertainty factor\\" built into the calculation as a safety factor would rapidly become arbitrary.Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed(FEEDAP) on a request from the European Commission on the safety evaluation of ractopamine The EFSA Journal (2009) 1041, 1-52 ;Canada, United States, Mexico Ractopamine use as a feed additive is authorized in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In the U.S., ractopamine is allowed to be used at a feed concentration of 5–20 mg/kg feed for finishing pigs and in dosages of 5–10 mg/kg feed for finishing pigs heavier than 109 kg. The maximum residue limit for ractopamine for meat in the USA is 50 parts per billion (ppb), or five times the standard set by the Codex Alimentarius. In 2017, the USDA approved of a new label, \\"No ractopamine — a beta-agonist growth promotant\\" to be used. The CFIA maintains the Canadian Ractopamine-Free Pork Certification Program (CRFPCP) so that Canadian exports to Asian countries are not disallowed by their authorities. Hundreds of commercial feed facilities, including some from overseas, are enrolled in the CRFPCP, a programme that is essentially based on self-certification and backed up by a randomized testing policy. Currently, the label for USDA organic means no synthetic compounds can be used other than those on the list of allowed synthetics; therefore, ractopamine would not be allowed in certified organic production. For Canadian domestic consumption of non-CRFPCP pork, ractopamine hydrochloride is permitted to be sold over the counter with applications in meal or pellet feed for finishing barrows and gilts (up to 10 mg/kg for last six weeks), confined finishing cattle (up to 30mg/kg for last 42 days), and finishing heavy turkeys (up to 9 mg/kg for 14 days). The withdrawal period was set to 0 days. ;Japan, South Korea Japan, which had permitted its feed additive use at least until 2009, and South Korea only allow import of meat with ractopamine residues up to the maximum residue limit (MRL), but do not permit its use in beef production. ;Taiwan In October 2006, Taiwan banned ractopamine along with other beta-adrenergic agonists, In a 2012 climb-down its legislature passed amendments to its Act Governing Food Sanitation, authorising government agencies to set safety standards for ractopamine. The Taiwanese Department of Health ultimately established an MRL of 10 ppb for ractopamine in beef on 31 July 2012. The American Institute in Taiwan, which represents U.S. interests in Taiwan, states that these \\"and many other countries have determined that meat from animals fed ractopamine is safe for human consumption\\"; this is in the context of an ongoing trade dispute between Taiwan and the US on this subject, which threatened to prevent Taiwan's entry to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. ;China, Russia In 2013, Russia and China banned ractopamine in pork,Smithfield Foods' profit falls 63% Michael Felberbaum, USA Today (AP) June 14, 2013, s.a. Smithfield Foods and Russia also in beef, deeming it unfit for human consumption. New Zealand, Russia In 2017, Russia banned imports of beef from New Zealand after finding ractopamine in New Zealand beef. Ractopamine is not registered for use in cattle in New Zealand. WADA proscription In 2015, an 18-year-old female karateka from Egypt gave a urine sample in order for her anti-doping control to be administered. It was found that the urine contained too much ractopamine and the athlete was sanctioned with ineligibility for four years. The sole arbitrator from the Court of Arbitration for Sport said that ractopamine \\"is not specifically mentioned by name in the World Anti-Doping Code (“WADC”), but is an Other Anabolic Agent prohibited under S1.2 of the 2015 Prohibited List under the WADC... Athlete did not fulfil her burden of proof to establish the origin of the prohibited substance, [and thus] she has committed an anti- doping rule violation\\". In October 2017 at a World Anti-Doping Agency conference, it was suggested in relation with ractopamine One conclusion reached in October 2017 was that there was a \\"clear risk for athletes to be tested positive\\" when consuming meat with residues at the MRL concentration. International disputes =US-EU WTO dispute= In the late 1990s, the World Trade Organization authorized the United States and Canada to impose retaliatory tariffs of US$116.8 million per year on the European Union after it found the EU beef hormone ban to be in violation of the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement). In September 2009, the trade representatives from the US and EU signed a memorandum of understanding, which established a new duty-free import quota in the European Union for grain-fed, high-quality beef as part of a compromise solution. =China= In July 2007, officials of the People's Republic of China seized US-produced pork for containing ractopamine residues.\\"China fights back, goes after U.S. meat\\", USA Today, July 14, 2007. Further shipments of ractopamine-fed pork were seized in September, though this time they were Canadian in origin.\\"China stops imports from Canadian pork plant over banned additive\\", Canada Press (2007-09-19) In June 2019, customs inspectors in China detected ractopamine in a batch of Canadian pork products destined for Chinese consumption. The Chinese government thereupon suspended not only pork but also beef imports from Canada. Canadian Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said that the CRFPCP certificate was a forgery and called in the RCMP, while Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale stressed that the Federal government would vigorously defend Canadian meat producers. Also at the press conference it was revealed that the Canadian Cattlemen's Association said in a statement that \\"We are fully confident in our meat production systems in Canada and the safeguards we have in place.\\" Meanwhile, holes were found in the CRFPCP programme because the meat packer at the centre of the maelstrom is a chilled butcher shop only. It was disclosed on 3 July that the Chinese authorities had discovered 188 falsified CRFPCP certificates. =Taiwan= Ractopamine has been banned in Taiwan since 2006. In the summer of 2007, two US shipments including ractopamine-laced pork were rejected by Taiwan's health authorities, while the Taiwan government had been considering lifting the ban on such imports. This resulted in mass protests in the capital city, Taipei, by swine farmers insisting that the ban remain in place. Health Minister Hou Sheng-mou (侯勝茂) declared no lifting of the ban would occur unless related laws were amended. Although the use of ractopamine in livestock is still banned and enforced on the domestic industry, and the government has maintained a “zero tolerance” policy on pork imports that contain it, Taiwan's legislature amended the food safety act in August 2012 to allow the import of beef products containing up to a maximum residue level of 10 parts per billion of the additive. The remaining restrictions have been an obstacle to the two nations signing a free-trade agreement, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR)’s 2018 Trade Policy Agenda and 2017 Annual Report assert that these remaining restrictions “...are not based upon science...” and highlights their removal as among the main priorities for the US in its trade with Taiwan. =Malaysia= According to the Malaysian Food Act 1983 and Regulations (as of 5 January 2010), ractopamine is allowed in pig muscle and fat (MRL of 10 ppb), pig liver (MRL of 40 ppb), and pig kidney (MRL of 90 ppb).Fifteenth A Schedule, Table 1, Maximum Permitted Proportion of Drug Residues in Food. Ractopamine is allowed as its half-life is lower, leading to reduced residues in the food, and the dose required to affect humans is much higher than other beta agonists. On 30 December 2008, the Malaysian Veterinary Services Department quarantined 10 of the 656 pig farms in Malaysia, as the livestock were found to contain the banned chemical. =Russia= The use of ractopamine in Russia is prohibited. On 6 June 2011, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture notified key meat import/exporters in Russia of a future prohibition of ractopamine in meat imported to Russia. On 7 December 2012, the prohibition went into force, and pork and beef export to Russia required submission of compliance certificates confirming absence of ractopamine in exported meat. Pharmacokinetics in humans A study was conducted to define the pharmacological response of humans to ractopamine. A single oral dose of 40 mg of ractopamine hydrochloride was given to human volunteers. The drug was rapidly absorbed; the mean blood plasma half-life was around 4 hrs and it was not detected in plasma 24 hrs after dosing. Less than 5% of total ractopamine excreted represented the parent drug, while the urinary metabolites were monoglucuronide and monosulfate conjugates, with ractopamine monosulfate being the major metabolite present.RACTOPAMINE (addendum). WHO FOOD ADDITIVES SERIES: 53 The metabolic fate of ractopamine hydrochloride is similar in the target species (pigs and cattle), laboratory animals, and humans. Besides the pharmacology effect, ractopamine may cause intoxication effect; therefore, any consumption by humans of a meat and/or byproducts of animals that consumed ractopamine with feed for growth stimulation, may result in such clinical effects as tachycardia and other heart rate increases, tremor, headache, muscle spasm, or high arterial blood pressure. The effect of ractopamine on humans is not entirely known, but consumption of products that contain ractopamine residues is not advisable for persons with cardiovascular diseases. Safety concerns =Target animal safety= In swine ractopamine is correlated with adverse effects, especially hyperactivity, trembling, and broken limbs, leading to censure by animal rights groups. In a conversation with Boulder Weekly newspaper Colorado State University Professor of Animal Science Temple Grandin, an expert on animal welfare, described harmful effects of ractopamine on feedlot animals, such as cattle with stiff, sore, and lame limbs, and increased heat stress. In the same column she also opines that meat from ractopamine-treated animals may be tougher. Ractopamine use is a factor in the development of downer pigs, animals that are unable to move or stand. When a winning show lamb tested positive for ractopamine in 2014, the owner said it was due to negligent feed contamination by the manufacturer, rather than intentional and illegal doping. Adverse effects =Acute toxicity= Oral levels in mice and rats are 3547–2545 mg/kg body weight (male and female) and 474–365 (male and female), respectively. =Genotoxicity and mutagenicity= Mutation studies in prokaryotes and eukaryotes show that ractopamine is not mutagenic. However, the results of several in vitro studies, including chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, are positive. The positive genotoxic results are explained with limited evidence to be due to a secondary auto-oxidative mechanism from ractopamine-catechol- producing reactive intermediates. =Carcinogenicity= Ractopamine is not considered to be a carcinogen and not listed by IARC, NTP, ACGIH, or OSHA. =Cardiovascular effects= Dose-dependent changes of heart rate and cardiac output are observed within the first hour after administration of ractopamine and gradually return to baseline values. The systolic blood pressure will also increase in a dose-dependent manner, while the diastolic pressure remains unchanged. =Musculoskeletal effects= Skeletal muscle tremor is the most common adverse effect of beta-agonists, and is more likely to be seen after oral administration than after inhalation. Tremor results from an imbalance between fast- and slow-twitch muscle groups of the extremities, and its severity varies greatly between individuals. =Behavioral changes in humans= Restlessness, apprehension, and anxiety were reported effects after the use of various beta-agonists, particularly after oral or parenteral treatment. In pilot clinical trials with ractopamine, four patients showed little evidence for central nervous system stimulation. Whether long-term treatment with these drugs results in the development of tolerance to these adverse effects is unclear. Analytical method for residues in livestock In cattle and swine tissue, it was found in 2007 that a procedure for the analysis of ractopamine residues in liver or muscle can be performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. The confirmatory method include reversed-phase HPLC/electrospray ionization triple tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. The limit of quantification of the drug using this LC/MS instrument was shown to be 1 ng/g. In cattle, a 2018 Chinese study promoted the use of hair as an indelible test of feed containing ractopamine. In popular culture Stuntman and comedian Steve-O has publicly spoken of his involvement as a test subject in an early ractopamine study whose aim was to determine the stress limits of ractopamine saturation in humans. Glover says \\"Based on how dangerous the study was, the more money you get.\\" References External links *Ractopamine page *Ractopamine study Category:World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited substances Category:1999 introductions Category:Food additives Category:Beta1-adrenergic agonists Category:Beta2-adrenergic agonists Category:Eli Lilly and Company brands Category:Pork Category:Phenols Category:Racemate Category:Agriculture in the United States Category:Agricultural research Category:Biotechnology products Category:Livestock Category:Medicated feed Category:Veterinary drugs Category:Food safety Category:Food and Drug Administration ","title":"Ractopamine"},{"id":"12251457","title":"1967 Washington Senators season"},{"id":"12251471","title":"1966 Washington Senators season"},{"id":"12251479","text":"Aleksei Gennadyevich Grishin (; ; born 18 June 1979) is a Belarusian freestyle skier who competed at five consecutive Olympics from 1998 to 2014.

Navy career Swenning was born at Manor, Texas and enlisted in the Navy on 9 September 1938. Upon completion of basic training at San Diego, California, he was transferred to USS New Orleans (CA-32) for duty. After participation in the defense of Pearl Harbor, the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway, and operations off Guadalcanal and in the Solomon Islands, Swenning was still serving in New Orleans on 30 November 1942. That night, Japanese naval forces began the Battle of Tassafaronga, Solomon Islands. Awarded the Navy Cross Swenning was a member of the Forward Repair Party when New Orleans was struck by a torpedo which detonated the forward magazines. He unhesitatingly dived through the oil and water in a flooded compartment to close a watertight door. In further efforts to assist in bringing the damaged ship to port, he labored tirelessly and continuously for twelve hours after the cessation of the action.

He is one of the most recorded conductors of his generation.  Early life  Serebrier was born in Montevideo to Russian and Polish parents of Jewish extraction. He first conducted an orchestra at the age of eleven, while at school. The school orchestra toured the country, which meant he was able to notch up over one hundred performances within four years. He graduated from the Municipal School of Music in Montevideo at fifteen, having studied violin, solfege, and Latin American folklore. Subsequently, he studied counterpoint, fugue, composition and conducting with Guido Santórsola, and piano with his wife, Sarah Bourdillon Santórsola. The National Orchestra, known as SODRE, announced a composition contest. Within two weeks, Serebrier had composed his \\"Legend of Faust\\" overture. It won. To his huge disappointment he was not allowed to conduct it, because he was only fifteen. The premiere was given to Eleazar de Carvalho, who later that same year became his conducting teacher at Tanglewood, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's summer home. He was awarded a United States State Department Fellowship to study at the Curtis Institute of Music, with Vittorio Giannini. Later he studied with Aaron Copland at Tanglewood, and with Pierre Monteux. His first symphony, written at the age of 17, was premiered by Leopold Stokowski, as the last minute substitute for the Ives Fourth Symphony, which proved still unplayable at the time. The recording of that Stokowski performance was released on CD in 2010. Another recording of this work was released by Naxos, also in 2010, with the composer conducting the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra.  Conducting  Serebrier's New York conducting debut with the American Symphony Orchestra was at Carnegie Hall in 1965. At the time, Ives' Fourth Symphony had been considered so difficult that it was performed using three conductors at its premiere in 1965, almost 50 years after its composition. Stokowski, Serebrier and a third conductor performed it this way. A few years later Serebrier conducted it on his own. He made his recording debut with the work, and Hi-Fi News and Record Review wrote of it: \\"This ... must surely count as one of the great achievements of the gramophone\\". He has had very many conducting posts, including principal guest conductor of the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra during the 1982–83 season. He was offered the post of Chief Conductor, but since he doesn't accept such positions he agreed to the title of Principal Guest Conductor. Leopold Stokowski named Serebrier Associate Conductor of the American Symphony Orchestra, a post he held for five years until going to Cleveland at George Szell's invitation. Serebrier married American soprano Carole Farley in 1969. They have made a number of recordings together. Serebrier's Third Symphony and his \\"Fantasia for strings\\" are amongst his most popular works. His style is energetic, colourful and melodic. One of his most unusual works is \\"Passacaglia and Perpetuum Mobile for accordion and chamber orchestra\\". His music is published mainly by Peermusic New York and Hamburg, and also by Peters Edition, Universal Edition Vienna, Hal Leonard, Kalmus, Boosey & Hawkes. All of his works have been recorded on various labels. In 2012, BIS Records released Serebrier's Flute Concerto with Tango, which they commissioned for flutist Sharon Bezaly. Serebrier tours the world with a number of orchestras. He has made several tours with the Russian National Orchestra, to South America and China. His first international tour was with the Juilliard Orchestra to 17 countries in Latin America. He has toured with the Pittsburgh Symphony, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Philharmonia Orchestra, The Orchestra of the Americas, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, and numerous others.  Awards  Serebrier has received 37 nominations for Grammy Awards and won 8 Grammies. In 1976 he won the Ditson Conductor's Award for commitment to American music. He won the Latin Grammy Awards of 2004 Best Classical Album for his own work, the \\"Carmen Symphony\\". In the Latin Grammy Awards of 2005 he was a nominee, for Glazunov's 5th Symphony.

Michael's works have been featured on television, film, and stage, and in art installations in New York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, and Minneapolis, and Madison, WI. He works in a wide variety of styles, but primarily enjoys writing for instrumental chamber ensembles and orchestra. Most evident in Michael's music is a rich use of both traditional and extended harmony balanced with sections of harmonic ambiguity and atonality. He believes that the combination of tonality and atonality is critical to the appreciation of both. By his own admission, he is obsessed with novel variation in both tone color and texture. He has been recognized as an adept and imaginative orchestrator. He works with both acoustic and electronic instruments in order to have access to as wide a palette of raw sound as possible. In addition to music, Michael has an avid interest in science and material experimentation and in the mid-1980s accepted a position as Production Manager for McHugh-Rollins Associates, a properties and special effects design firm in New York City. While in that position he oversaw the special effects production of such large Broadway shows as The Phantom of the Opera and Les Misérables and implemented the effects for Ingmar Bergman's production of Hamlet at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, as well as many other stage productions and films. Michael did his undergraduate studies at the Eastman School of Music, graduate work at the New England Conservatory of Music, the Institute of Audio Research, New York University, and the University of Minnesota. Michael plays the piano, trombone, and a wide variety of electronic instruments. His greatest musical influences and mentors have been: Robert Bailey, James Hepokoski, Daniel Pinkham, Jan Gorbaty, Dominic Argento, and Henry Schmidt. Michael currently resides in Minneapolis, where, in addition to his work as a composer and arranger, he occasionally performs on the piano and trombone. Michael is an active member of the American Composers Forum.  Recent works  * On the Departure of a Beloved Friend - for French horn choir and tuba. Written in memoriam Larry Jonas.

The particle sizes range from 0.1 to 100 um and 86% of these particles are less than 5 um in diameter and therefore capable of entry into the alveoli. Health implications Fungi are ubiquitous organisms that play a vital role in decomposing organic matter. Many species of fungi live on the human body and some will infect nails causing a condition called onychomycosis. There are oral and topical antifungal therapies for this condition, however, in some instances cutting, filing, or abrading the nail may be necessary to improve cure rates.(2003) \\"Adverse Human Health Effects Associated with Molds in the Indoor Environment\\". Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine 45(5) 470-478 Thickened nails caused by injury, infection, diabetes, psoriasis, or vascular disease may require the use of a mechanical therapy, which can expose the healthcare worker to microbial dust. Exposure to nail dust was first discussed and described in the literature as an occupational hazard in the early 70's.Pugh J, Skone JF (1972) \\"The health of the chiropodist in a developing community service\\". The Chiropodist 27(2)53-55 In 1975, two female chiropodists were diagnosed with allergic hypersensitivity to nail dustDavies RR, Ganderton MA (1975) \\"Allergic hazards in chiropody\\". Chiropodist 30(89) 89-92 Since that time, there have been a number of occupational-related complaints pertaining to airborne nail dust exposure and efforts have been made to study the podiatric professionals to determine related symptoms. Biological dust from the hand and foot care procedures may deposit in the conjunctiva, nose, and throughout the respiratory tract. The local irritation of these areas can lead to conjunctivitis, itching, tearing, rhinitis, sneezing, asthmatic attacks, bronchitis, and coughing.Duell B L, Arruda LK, Chapman MD, Platts-Mills TAE (1991). \\"Trichophyton tonsurans Allergen. Characterization of a protein that causes immediate but not delayed hypersensitivity\\". Journal of Immunology 147 136, 96-101 The literature suggests that nail dust can be a respiratory sensitizer, which is defined as a substance that when breathed in can trigger an irreversible allergic reaction in the respiratory system.(1991) Medical aspects of occupational asthma. Health and Safety Executive Publications, Medical Series 25 16 Sensitization does not usually take place immediately, but rather after months or years of exposure to the agent. Once sensitized, even the smallest amount of the substance can trigger asthma, rhinitis, or conjunctivitis that may exhibit the following symptoms: coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, runny or stuffy nose, and watery or prickly eyes. Millar found that within the podiatry profession there is four times the national prevalence of asthma.Millar NA (2000). The ocular risks of human nail dust in podiatry. PhD Thesis, Glasgow Caledonian University Hypersensitivity reactions are the most probable disposition for healthcare workers inhaling nail dust, although more serious lung pathology can not be ruled out Davies RR, Ganderton MA, Savage M (1983). \\"Human nail dust and precipitating antibodies to Trichophyton rubrum in chiropodists\\". Clin Allergy 13309-315Ward PE (1995). \\"Atopy and reaction to nail dust inhalation\\". Clinics in Podiatric Medicine 12(2) 275-278 It is widely known and accepted that fungi will induce asthma, but it is estimated that only 10% of the population has allergic antibodies to fungal antigens, and half of them, that is 5% of the population, would be asymptomatic, further complicating the link between the fungal dust and troubling symptoms.Millar NA, Burrow, JG, Hay J, Stevenson R (1996) \\"Putative risks of ocular infection for chiropodists and podiatrists\\". Journal of British Podiatric Medicine 51(11) 158-160 Trichophyton rubrum is the most common fungal cause of nail dystrophy. Studies conducted in England found that the prevalence of trichophyton rubrum antibodies in podiatrists ranged from 14%-31%.Abramson, Carl and Wilton, James (1992). \\"Nail dust aerosols from onychomycotic toenails\\". Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association 82(2)563-567 This is evidence that the podiatrist is heavily exposed to trichophyton rubrum as observed in increased precipitating antibodies compared to the general population. It has been suggested that absorption of trichophyton fungal antigens can give rise to immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody production, sensitization of the airways, and symptomatic asthma and rhinitis.Kivity S, Schawarz Y, Fireman E (1992). \\"The association of perennial rhinitis with trichophyton infection\\". Clinical and Experimental Allergy 22(4)498-500 Nail work requiring clipping and drilling is also a potential cause for ocular injury and infection to the podiatrists, podiatric staff, and patients that are exposed to nail fragments and high-speed drills used for grinding.Davis JM, Kugler G, Nixon BP (1991). \\"Eye Injury in a Podiatrist\\". Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association 81(12)661-663 Possible ocular hazards result from exposure to foreign bodies, allergens, bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa that can be introduced at the time of eye trauma, or enter as a consequence of damage to the ocular structures; permitting the entry of opportunistic infection. The high-speed rotation of podiatry drill burrs potentially expose the healthcare worker to aerosols containing bloodborne pathogens such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or HIV.Bell KM, Clement DA (1991). \\"Eye protection for the surgeon\\". JR Coll Surg Edinb 36178-179 Davies et al. surveyed podiatrists and found that 41% of them complained of eye problems, particularly soreness, burning, itching and excess lacrimation. A 1990 case illustrates the potential for ocular trauma to the healthcare provider: A podiatrist suffered a lacerated cornea when hit by a metallic shard from the grinding bit or by a fragment from the patient's toenail. The podiatrist reported fleeting periods of blurriness for several months following the incident. The healthcare worker's exposure to foreign bodies is not well documented in the literature like they are with dental staff using similar equipment; however, many of these incidents are certain to go unreported. The healthcare provider's risk of injury during nail care, however slight, warrants the use of simple and inexpensive preventative measures. Infections in the patients There have been numerous accounts of patients with trichophyton fungal infections and associated asthma, which further substantiates the likelihood of respiratory disease transmission to the healthcare provider being exposed to the microbe-laden nail dustWard GW, Woodfolk JA, Hayden ML, Jackson S, Platts-Mills TAE (1999). \\"Treatment of late-onset asthma with fluconazole\\". J Allergy Clin Immunol 104 546-550 In 1975, a dermatophyte fungal infection was described in a patient with severe tinea.

Best practice is to avoid electrical debridement or burring of mycotic nails unless the treatment is necessary. When the procedure is necessary, it is possible to reduce exposure by using nail dust extractors, local exhaust, good housekeeping techniques, personal protective equipment such as gloves, glasses or goggles, face shields, and an appropriately fitted disposable respirators to protect against the hazards of nail dust and flying debris.

Raines (March 30, 1911 - May 10, 2000) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse trainer. Known as \\"Buddy\\" Raines, in the 1930s he began working as a stable hand and became an exercise rider, notably for the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame colt Cavalcade. He went on to condition racehorses for 65 years, working primarily on the U.S. East Coast and was a regular at Delaware Park and Monmouth Park Racetracks. Buddy Raines met with his greatest success training horses for Donald Ross's Brandywine Stable. He had great success with Cochise, winning several important races between 1949 and 1951, including the Massachusetts and Arlington Handicaps and the Saratoga Cup and set or equaled track records at Suffolk Downs and Delaware Park. In July 1950, with the colt Greek Song, Raines won the Arlington Classic, a race that at the time was one of the most important in America. As a stallion, Greek Song was mated to the mare Lucy Lufton, a granddaughter of the great sire Nearco. Their union produced Greek Money who would give Buddy Raines his most important win in 1962 when the chestnut colt won a U.S. Triple Crown race, the Preakness Stakes. In 1966, Raines conditioned Open Fire to a champion season. The daughter of Brandywine Stable's Cochise, Open Fire won the Delaware Handicap, the Spinster Stakes as well as the Diana Handicap en route to being voted Co-U.S. Champion Older Mare. On a personal basis, Buddy Raines played a major role in the rearing of his grandsons John and Mike Luzzi who both became jockeys. One of the family's great memories came in 1991 when the eighty-year- old Raines saddled Timely Warning and watched as grandson Mike Luzzi won the Maryland Million Classic and the Brooklyn Handicap. In 1996 Monmouth Park began awarding the Virgil W. Raines Distinguished Achievement Award which honors an owner or trainer who has shown a dedication to the sport of Thoroughbred racing through exemplary conduct demonstrating professionalism and integrity. Buddy Raines was residing in Aiken, South Carolina at the time of his death in 2000. He was nominated for induction in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2006. In 2008, Raines was inducted posthumously in the Delaware Park Wall of Fame.

It is a form of the Old French name Alis (older Alais), short form of Adelais, which is derivation from the Old High German Adalhaidis (see Adelaide), from the Proto-Germanic words , meaning \\"noble\\" and , meaning \\"appearance; kind\\" (compare German Adel \\"nobility\\", edel \\"noble\\", nominalizing suffix -heit \\"-hood\\"), hence \\"of noble character or rank, of nobility\\". Alaïs is the Old French form of the name; Alys of Vexin was also known as Alaïs. Alice was the most popular female baby name in Sweden in 2009 and has been among the top 10 names given to girls for the past five years.Namnstatistik – Statistik från SCB The name ranks in the top 100 most popular names for baby girls in Australia, Belgium, France, Canada, Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales, and Northern Ireland. In England and Wales it was ranked the 24th most popular name in 2015. It ranked as the 172nd most popular name for baby girls born in the United States in 2010. The name was most popular in the US in the Victorian era and at the turn of the 20th century. It has been popularized by Alice in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll. It was also popular in the Victorian era due to The Princess Alice, a daughter of Queen Victoria. In the US, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, daughter of Theodore Roosevelt, was occasionally known as \\"Princess Alice\\" in the press and inspired a song called Alice Blue Gown. In recent years in the US, the variants Alicia, Alison, and a short form, Allie, have been more popular names: in 2010, Alison was the 38th most popular; Alicia was the 220th most popular, and Allie was the 189th most popular. All three names have multiple spelling variants which are also well-used. Alyssa, the 20th most popular in 2010, may sound like a variant, but it is historically of different origin, from the flower alyssum. Like Adelaide, Alice's name day is 16 December, for Adelaide of Italy.

Biography Buzzi-Peccia was born 13 October 1854 in Milan, Italy, to Antonio and Clotilde Peccia. In 1868, he was accepted at the Milan Conservatory where he studied composition under Antonio Bazzini. In the late 1870s, he went to Paris to continue his studies under Massenet and Saint-Saëns. He returned to Italy, first to Milan and eventually taking a position in Turin as a voice teacher. He began to write music while still in school, and composed three works to secure his diploma from the Milan Conservatory in 1875. In 1886 his ' was performed at La Scala. His symphonic poem ' received critical acclaim when it premiered at La Scala in 1888. The 1897 premiere in Turin of Buzzi-Peccia's only opera, ', was conducted by Arturo Toscanini. One of his best-known works is \\"Lolita: Serenata spagnola\\" (1892), recorded by many singers over the years including Enrico Caruso, Titta Ruffo, and Franco Corelli. His was sung by Joseph Schmidt in the 1934 film My Song Goes Round the World. Most of his songs were written in Italian, but he also wrote lyrics in French and English. His most famous novelty song, (Song of the Cigarette), was written in French. He came to the United States in 1898 to teach voice at the Chicago Musical College with references from such notables as Giuseppe Verdi and Arrigo Boito. Two years later Buzzi-Peccia moved to New York to teach at the Metropolitan College of Music. He was the first voice teacher of Alma Gluck, and also of Sophie Braslau. Another pupil of Buzzi-Peccia was the poet Dorothy Caruso, wife of Enrico Caruso. In addition to Caruso, many artists recorded Buzzi-Peccia's songs, among them Beniamino Gigli, Carlo Bergonzi, Mario Lanza, Luciano Pavarotti, Giuseppe Di Stefano, and Roberto Alagna.

Ingvar Natanael Lidholm (24 February 1921 – 17 October 2017https://www.svd.se/tonsattaren-ingvar-lidholm-dod) was a Swedish composer. Early years: 1921–1940 Ingvar Lidholm was born in Jönköping. The actual family home was in Nässjö, some 40 kilometers to the southeast. Neither of his parents was particularly musical: his father worked for Swedish Railways and his mother was a homemaker. But the home environment was one in which music was encouraged. Ingvar was the youngest of four children, all of whom made music at home. The family owned a piano, and Lidholm began his \\"musical explorations\\" at an early age. By the age of eleven, Lidholm and his family had moved to Södertälje, which lies to the south of Stockholm. Both at school and at home, he rapidly began to develop his musical skills as a performer – and as a composer. By age twelve, he was writing songs in a tonal and romantic idiom, which led gradually to exercises of larger proportions, including music for full orchestra.Some of these early scores have been preserved in the composer’s personal library; a good many have been discarded. Unfortunately, a similar fate befell most of Lidholm’s sketches for his later, mature works. Thus, evolutionary studies of individual works, using sketch material, cannot be attempted for most of his output. Ingvar Lidholm, private interview with Bruce Brolsma conducted 18 May 1978, in Rönninge, Sweden. This early period also included orchestration studies with Natanael Berg in Stockholm. Lidholm's primary performance area was stringed instruments; he eventually studied and mastered all four instruments of the string family. As a gymnasium student, he played viola and contrabass in the school orchestra, and studied violin from the German master Hermann Gramss. He remained active in composition throughout his school years and completed what may be considered his final student work early in 1940: the Elegisk svit (“Elegiac Suite”) for string quartet. Several songs he wrote later that summer (including För vilsna fötter sjunger gräset) were to become his earliest published pieces. In 1940, Lidholm completed his studies at the gymnasium and passed the Studentexamen, the standard prerequisite test for higher education in Sweden. University: 1940–1947 With the fall of 1940, Lidholm began his advanced musical studies at the Musikhögskolan in Stockholm. There, he established friendships with two other students at the conservatory who were to become important composers in their own right: Sven-Erik Bäck and Karl- Birger Blomdahl. Over the following decades, these three men were to hold similar, and influential, posts at Swedish Radio (the state broadcasting organization) and the Musikhögskola. They, in turn, were to affect the growth and education of many younger Swedish composers and musicians. As students with common interests, Lidhom, Bäck and Blomdahl began to meet together, eventually more regularly, and it came about that their gatherings fell on Mondays. Additional students, and then instructors, began to drop in; they held critiques and discussions of music, as well as performances of contemporary works. Hilding Rosenberg, who was to be Lidholm's composition teacher for two years, was especially important in leading studies into Hindemith, Stravinsky and other modern composers. Thus evolved what was later to be called the Måndagsgrupp. Under Rosenberg, Lidholm began to achieve a higher compositional output than previously, including: incidental music to a play of Georg Büchner, Leonce och Lena, from which the song Rosettas visa was published separately; Madonnas vaggvisa (“The Madonna’s Cradle Song”) for voice and piano; and På kungens slott (“At the King’s Castle”), a collection of children's piano pieces. A further teaching piece for piano, Allegro-Koral- Risoluto, followed the next year. The early part of summer of 1944, he completed Toccata e Canto for a chamber orchestra of strings and solo winds. With its debut, this work of the twenty-one-year-old composer attracted immediate interest within Swedish music circles. The following year, he wrote the Concerto for string orchestra, and in 1946 a Sonata for solo flute. Lidholm spent the academic year 1946/47 abroad as the recipient of a governmental Jenny Lind scholarship, during which he broadened his artistic experiences, meeting people, discussing ideas, and planning compositions. While in Bergen, Norway, he wrote the Sonata for piano, dedicated to musicologist and pianist Ingmar Bengtsson. He auditioned and was accepted for the position of musical director of the Örebro Orchestral Society in 1947, a position he held until 1956. (His work Mutanza was written in 1959 for the society.) New compositional directions: 1947–1956 During 1947/48, Ingvar Lidholm completed a number of new works: the piano pieces Sonatin (“Sonatina”), (10) Miniatyrer (“Ten Miniatures”), and Lätta pianostycken (“Easy Piano Pieces”). An important work of this period was Laudi for a cappella mixed choir, published in 1948. This piece was a clear departure from traditional Swedish choral works. The conductor Eric Ericson had this to say about the impact of Laudi: I remember so well our first contact with Lidholm’s Laudi – how depressed we were after the first rehearsal. We understood nothing! The piece appeared like a high wall! But we struggled through and in that way taught ourselves not just Laudi but many other pieces.... What had been very difficult gradually became natural.Quoted in Lars Edlund, “Den nya körmusiken” in Svensk musik perspektiv (Stockholm: Nordiska musicförlaget, 1971), pp. 330–331. Translation Bruce E. Brolsma. Laudi was the first of Lidholm's works to be performed at a convocation of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM), at Brussels in 1950. In 1949, he attended seminars on music held at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in Germany (including lectures by Leibowitz on twelve-tone technique, and talks by Messiaen and Fortner). Shortly after returning from Darmstadt, Lidholm wrote a brief piano work, Klavierstück 1949. It is not directly inspired by Arnold Schoenberg's similarly titled piano piece,Ingvar Lidholm, private interview with Bruce Brolsma conducted 18 May 1978, in Rönninge, Sweden. but Lidholm was familiar with it. Fyra körer (“Four choruses”) from 1953 also uses a free application of twelve-tone technique. In late 1953, Lidholm pursued further compositional studies with Mátyás Seiber in London for several months.An account of these studies was written by Lidholm after the death of Seiber. See Nutida music, No. 3 (1960), p. 16. Work from this period includes the Invention for various instrumental combinations and Concertino, a 13-minute chamber work he wrote upon the commission of the Guildhall Music Society. During his time in London, Lidholm made contact with Messiaen and Luigi Dallapiccola. Within a year after his return to Sweden, Lidholm had completed a suite for cello and piano that pays tribute to Dallapiccola, and Lidholm produced his first large-scale orchestral work, Ritornell, in 1955, the piece with which he became internationally known. Lidholm remarked “After some years of mainly working with chamber music, I desired to test my abilities in a work for larger ensemble.”Ingvar Lidholm, “Tankar kring Ritornell” in Modern nordisk music (Stockhollm: Natur & Kultur, 1957), p. 205. Translation Bruce E. Brolsma. It made use of large cluster chords and protracted use of percussion. In the ensuing years, Lidholm's works were performed in different cities, especially within Sweden and Germany.Lists of concert programs are contained in the first decade of issues from the periodical Nutida music, beginning in 1957. Lidholm, in his prefatory remarks on his compositional style in Ritornell, quoted Igor Stravinsky's definition of music as “…a spirit’s free investigation.”Ingvar Lidholm, Tankar kring Ritornell, p. 205. He composed in a number of styles of the course of his career, but never keyed his music to a methodology within any one of those styles. Thus, there is not the systematization of Hindemith in his works from the forties, or a strict serial technique in his works of the fifties. Only a small percentage of Lidholm's serial music subscribes to strict pitch order throughout the work. In Ritornell, for example, extraneous pitches are freely integrated into row order, and there is no deliberate effort to maintain an atonal orientation. International recognition: 1956–1960 In 1956, Lidholm left his conducting post in Örebro to assume the head of the Chamber Music Department at Swedish Radio. He was instrumental in establishing the periodical Nutida musik (“Contemporary Music”) as an adjunct to the music series of the same name begun in 1957 by Swedish Radio. It was at this time that he came into contact with electronic music. In the fall of 1957, he made a visit to the Studio di Fonologia Musicale in Milan, and by 1959 he had produced his first electronic composition, as an accompaniment to his ballet, Riter; its electronic tape segments were somewhat akin to Blomdahl's opera Aniara of the same year. The tapes served to augment and accompany the orchestral forces. Riter was written for Birgit Åkesson (who also choreographed Bäck's A Game Around a Game in 1959). Later, he aided in establishing an independent electronic music laboratory for the Musikhögskola. Skaldens natt (The Poet's Night) from 1957 was not a commissioned work, receiving its premier in Hamburg in 1959 as part of the West German new music series, Das neue Werk. The piece won first prize in the ISCM international composition competition at Rome. He contributed a good deal toward an original and important a cappella choir literature during the second half of the 1950s. The first of these works was Canto LXXXI in 1956, whose text is an excerpt of the canto of the same name by Ezra Pound. The twelve-tone series used for Canto LXXXI was later used in a series of other choral works from 1959 to form an A cappella-bok (A Cappella Book) collection. The first part of 1960 was devoted to the composition of Motus-colores for orchestra, commissioned by the Südwestfunk Orchestra of Baden-Baden, for large chamber orchestra with dominating percussion.Ingvar Lidholm, ″Rörelser I färger″ in Nutida music, No. 2 (1960/61), p. 23. The pitch content was organized serially, but with just nine, not twelve, pitches to the row, plus the inversion of that row. Following Motus-colores, Lidholm did not produce any compositions for the next two years. Moving away from serial music: 1963 and beyond A distinctly new era begins in 1963, when Lidholm abandoned serial principles of pitch organization in his two works from that year: Nausikaa ensam (“Nausicaa Alone”) and Poesis. In writing Nausikaa, Lidholm had to take into consideration of the performance abilities of the commissioning body, the orchestra of the music high school of Ingesund, Sweden. Poesis, on the other hand, was commissioned for the fiftieth anniversary of the Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. Lidholm's inaugural lecture at the Musikhogskola describes the process of writing Poesis.Ingvar Lidholm, ″Poesis for Orchestra″ in Three Aspects of New Music, The Royal Academy of Music and The Royal Swedish College of Music, Publication No. 4 (Stockholm: Nordiska musikforlaget, 1968), pp. 57 – 80. One of the distinguishing characteristics of Poesis is its graphic notation, due to Lidholm's abandonment of even loose pitch serialization. In keeping with the works of other composers who introduce new graphical notations, there are several pages of explanatory notes as a preface to the score. This was Lidholm's first composition with newer-style notation, but certainly not his last: In 1971, he composed Stamp music. This celebrated a stamp issue which honored the 200th anniversary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. In 1964, Lidholm decided to leave his post at Swedish Radio and succeed Karl-Birger Blomdahl as professor of composition (a ten-year, non-renewable appointment) at the Musikhogskola. Due to his teaching duties, he produced just four works for the period 1965-1975. He began exploring the challenges of a medium for which he had not yet written, opera. Together with his librettist, Herbert Grevenius, he settled on reworking an unfinished drama of August Strindberg, Holländarn (“The Dutchman”). This was a joint commission from Swedish Radio-RV and West German Television, which meant that the opera was to be not for the stage, but for television, the first such work by a Scandinavian composer. Premiered in December, 1967, it captured the opera prizes of Florence and Salzburg in 1968. In 1973, he completed a commission from the governmental arts board of Sweden, Rikskonserter, for an a cappella choral work, …a riveder le stelle, in which rhythm is subordinated to allow for maximal exposure of the harmony and melody, using whole-tone and pentatonic as well as diatonic pitch organization.Brolsma, Bruce Edward. The Music of Ingvar Lidholm: A Survey and Analysis. Ph.D. dissertation (Music Theory), Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, USA, 1979, p. 89. Its serenity stands in contrast to the work that followed it, Greetings from an old world, commissioned by the Clarion Music Society of New York City in 1976. The “old world” of the title is brought into play through the use of Heinrich Isaac's tune, Innsbruck, Ich muss dich lassen. The overall effect of this stylistic mixture is reminiscent of Charles Ives, and other Scandinavian composers such as Lars Johan Werle and Lars Edlund who have utilized tonal and atonal styles within the same piece.Ibid., p. 98. In 1978, Lidholm completed a commission for another choral work, Perserna (“The Persians”), adapted from Aeschylus’ play of the same name, and set for a cappella male choir and three soloists. This was followed the same year by Kontakion, in which he uses Russian Orthodox choral music, again as with Greetings from an old world bridging early music and the avant- garde. His second opera, Ett drömspel (1992) is based on Strindberg's \\"A Dream Play\\". In 1993, Ingvar Lidholm won the Rolf Schock Prize. He played the violin and viola, conducted and served on musical juries. His notable students include Edward Applebaum and Anders Eliasson. Lidholm established a reputation as a composer of demanding (but well-respected) choral music during his early career, and he continued to compose vocal music throughout his career, and especially during his later years.

It briefly touches on the real life disappearance of Juanita Nielsen, an activist against mass development in Sydney in the late 1970s. The film is directed by Donald Crombie and was shot in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The mysterious disappearance of Juanita Nielson also inspired Phillip Noyce for his 1982 film Heatwave. Plot The film stars Elizabeth Alexander as Jessica Simmonds, who returns home from London to discover the street she grew up in being torn down by developers for high rise developments. Her father (Alexander Archdale), a vocal opponent of the developers, is killed in a suspicious fire and Jessica takes up the cause of the local residents. She joins forces with Jeff Elliot (John Hargreaves), a union leader. As they probe further into the background of the development they unearth sinister connections between the development group and organised crime. Cast * Liz Alexander - Jessica * John Hargreaves - Elliott * Reg Lye - Riley * David Downer - Alan * Caz Lederman - Nancy * Alexander Archdale - B.C. Simmonds * Allen Bickford - Collins * Gordon McDougall - Sir Arthur Wadham * Ric Herbert - Ben * Pnina Bloch - Zoe * John Stone - Mr. Benson * Arkie Whiteley - Tina Benson * Norman Kaye - Mander * Peter De Salis - Melville Production Antony Buckley and Donald Crombie became interested in the story while making The Irishman. The first script was written by actor Michael Craig and was called The Juanita Factor being based directly on Juanita Nielsen. Cecil Holmes then worked on further drafts. However, there was concern the script would not be able to be filmed because of legal issues. It was decided to fictionalise the script and change the character's names.David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p212-214 It was originally intended to cast an overseas star because of the large budget. At one stage Julie Christie was cast but UAA, who were going to finance the film, did not come up with enough money. Helen Morse was then approached; she tentatively agreed but wanted more work done on the script. Evan Jones was brought out to work on a new draft, but despite this Morse eventually declined. Buckley decided not to use UAA to raise money and did it himself. When Julie Christie was going to play the lead, Bill Hunter was cast opposite her. However, eventually the lead role went to Elizabeth Alexander and Crombie felt she and Hunter did not play well together. So Hunter was replaced by John Hargreaves.\\"Interview with Donald Crombie\\", Signet, 18 December 1998 accessed 16 November 2012 Donald Crombie says making the film was fraught with tension: > We researched it pretty thoroughly and we got fairly close to the beast, I > think. We were peculiarly warned off by none other a person than John Dowd, > who's a judge now, I believe. He rang Tony Buckley and said that this film > was a bit close to the bone and - talking about me - he said, \\"He's got > young children and he should be thinking a bit about what he's doing.\\" It > didn't put us off, but you did look under the car for about two days > afterwards because you thought, hang on a minute, what's all this about... > And the nexus between government and big business and crime. They're very > comfortable together. Awards The film was entered into the 32nd Berlin International Film Festival, where it won an Honourable Mention.

He also served in the United States Army until his honourable discharge. He has co-authored two books, Rockbound and Backstage Vancouver. Rockbound is his personal accounts of early rock and roll. Backstage Vancouver looks at the rich history of entertainment in Vancouver. Robinson hosted the first television quiz show dedicated to trivia, titled Trivia, on Vancouver CBC Television station CBUT for three years.

History  Barley was the most prolific grain eaten by the arya of the Vedic period. One preparation was a sweet cake called apūpa, where barley flour was either fried in ghee or boiled in water, and then dipped in honey. Malpua preserves both the name and the essentials of this preparation. Malapua and its varieties Malpua is popular in Bangladesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Maharashtra and Nepal where it is served during festivals along with other sweets. The batter for malpua in some areas is prepared by crushing ripe bananas or (in Bangladesh) coconut, adding flour, and water or milk. The mixture is sometimes delicately seasoned with cardamoms. It is deep fried in oil, and served hot. In Odisha the Malpua fritters are dipped in syrup after they are fried. The Bihari version of this dish has sugar added to the batter prior to frying. Amalu (Malpua) is one of the Chapana Bhoga of Lord Jagannath and is included in the Sanja Dhupa (evening prayer). Other variations of Malpua use pineapples or mangoes instead of bananas. Bengali, Maithili and Odia malpua is traditionally made only with thickened milk and a little flour (sometimes rice flour instead of wheat flour). Malpua in northern India, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan, don't contain fruit. There are several variations, using some or all of the following ingredients: maida (refined flour), semolina, milk, and yogurt. The batter is left to stand for a few hours before being spooned into a kadhai of hot oil to form a bubbling pancake which should be crisp around the edges. The pancakes are then immersed in a thick sugar syrup. Malpua is a popular sweet to make on the Hindu religious occasion of Holi. Malpua along with mutton curry is served in many non-vegetarian Maithil homes during Holi. Malapua in Nepal also known as Marpa is specially made in the Kathmandu Valley which uses maida, mashed up ripe bananas, fennel seeds, pepper corns, milk and sugar into a batter and prepared in a similar way as in India. Malpua is a famous dish during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Muslim families across India, as well as Pakistan prepare malpuas for iftar (meal to break the fast). This malpua includes maida, rawa, and khoya/ mawa (milk solids), and is deep fried to take the shape of a pancake. In some recipes, malpuas are dipped in sugar syrup called sira before serving. They are famous in Odia cuisine.

He was the brother of Rodolfo Halffter and part of the Grupo de los Ocho (), which formed a sub-set of the Generation of '27. Early years Ernesto Halffter was the third son of Prussian jeweller Ernest Halffter Hein and his wife Rosario Escriche Erradón. He was the younger brother of composer Rodolfo Halffter and the uncle of composer Cristóbal Halffter. Halffter was born in Madrid and studied at the Colegio Alemán. He wrote his earliest composition at the age of six, and in 1922 his piano teacher Fernando Ember performed three pieces from Crepúsculos at the Ritz Hotel in Madrid. After meeting Manuel de Falla in 1923, Halffter sent Falla the score of his \\"Homenajes\\" trio for violin, cello and piano, which began a long relationship that included composition lessons from Falla. Career Halffter's Sinfonietta is one of his earliest and best works; it shows the influence of Domenico Scarlatti. Later, he became more nationalistic with Rapsodia portuguesa for piano and orchestra, composed in 1938, during the Spanish Civil War. He wrote music for a dozen films. Perhaps the most noteworthy is Don Quixote de la Mancha, the 1947 film version of Miguel de Cervantes's classic novel. He also adapted and conducted the music for El amor brujo (1967), based on the ballet by Falla. It was directed by Francisco Rovira Beleta, was nominated for an Oscar and features guitarist Narciso Yepes. In 1934 Halffter became director and conductor of the Seville Conservatory of Music but, being married to the Portuguese pianist Alice Câmara Santos, chose to live in Lisbon during this period up to 1954. His only pupil was the Finnish composer Ann- Elise Hannikainen, who also became his life companion during his later life. When Falla died in 1946, he left his opera Atlántida incomplete; Ernesto Halffter was asked to complete it. It premiered in 1962, but Halffter later revised it. The second version was completed in 1976. In 1974, the Dalí Theatre and Museum in Figueras, Spain, was opened. Halffter was a personal friend of Salvador Dalí, and was asked to write a piece of music to celebrate the event. In response he composed Homenaje a Salvador Dali. Halffter was awarded Spain's Premio Nacional de Música for composition in 1984. He died in Madrid.

Given the dynamic nature of information risk and security, the ISMS concept incorporates continuous feedback and improvement activities to respond to changes in the threats, vulnerabilities or impacts of incidents. The standards are the product of ISO/IEC JTC1 (Joint Technical Committee 1) SC27 (Subcommittee 27), an international body that meets in person twice a year. The ISO/IEC standards are sold directly by ISO, mostly in English, French and Chinese. Sales outlets associated with various national standards bodies also sell directly translated versions in other languages. Early history Many people and organisations are involved in the development and maintenance of the ISO27K standards. The first standard in this series was ISO/IEC 17799:2000; this was a fast-tracking of the existing British standard BS 7799 part 1:1999 The initial release of BS 7799 was based, in part, on an information security policy manual developed by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1993, what was then the Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom) convened a team to review existing practice in information security, with the goal of producing a standards document. In 1995, the BSI Group published the first version of BS 7799. One of the principal authors of BS 7799 recalls that, at the beginning of 1993, \\"The DTI decided to quickly assemble a group of industry representatives from seven different sectors: Shell ([David Lacey] and Les Riley), BOC Group (Neil Twist), BT (Dennis Willets), Marks & Spencer (Steve Jones), Midland Bank (Richard Hackworth), Nationwide (John Bowles) and Unilever (Rolf Moulton).\\" David Lacey credits Donn B. Parker as having the \\"original idea of establishing a set of information security controls\\", and with producing a document containing a \\"collection of around a hundred baseline controls\\" by the late 1980s for \\"the I-4 Information Security circle which he conceived and founded.\\"  Published standards  The published ISO27K standards related to \\"information technology - security techniques\\" are: #ISO/IEC 27000 — Information security management systems — Overview and vocabulary #ISO/IEC 27001 — Information technology - Security Techniques - Information security management systems — Requirements.

It was completed in 1964 by Ronald Ward and Partners, the designers of St George's House, at one end of the walk, and Millbank Tower in Westminster. Location St. George's Walk forms the central part of a complex bounded to the south by Katharine Street, to the north by Park Street, and to the east and west by Park Lane and High Street respectively. The complex is bisected by Fell Road. , only the eastern half was roofed. Nestlé's former UK headquarters, St George's House, forms part of the complex at the Park Lane end. History The area is substantially less busy than its competitors in Croydon, Centrale, the Whitgift Centre and Surrey Street Market. This is partly because the parade does not house any well-known chains. In 2005, a compulsory purchase order was issued by Croydon Council and it was planned to demolish St George's Walk by 2011 and replace it with the new Park Place shopping centre which would span from North End to Queen's Gardens. There had been little local opposition, but the owners of the shops facing eviction were not offered places in the new shopping centre proposed by Minerva plc. Croydon Council terminated the scheme in May 2009 due to planning permission having lapsed on the venture and concerns over funding, and a new redevelopment scheme to attract retailer John Lewis to the town was being investigated. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding a possible redevelopment, some of the established businesses, both in the precinct and where the development formed part of neighbouring roads, either closed or re-located, and by 2010, the area had become run-down. This led to the council offering short-term leases to local traders, to try to keep the area viable. In April 2018, several units were converted to 1980s-style shops for filming of series five of Black Mirror. In November 2018, work began on the redevelopment, with offices and shops on the south side of the complex due to be demolished to make way for a new public square to be known as Queen's Square. Work was also underway on the conversion of St George's House into residential flats. Transport links St George's Walk has various transport links nearby. George Street is the closest Tramlink stop. From there services run to Wimbledon station with connections to the London Underground, or to Beckenham Junction station and Elmers End station (via West Croydon) with train connections to Sutton and to Central London as well as London Overground services. There are also tram services from East Croydon to New Addington, Elmers End and Beckenham. There is a bus station at West Croydon with buses on the northbound corridor and the rest of the borough and multiple bus routes serve both Park Street and Katharine Street. East Croydon station, the main Network Rail station in the borough, is close by and offers mainline services from Southern and Thameslink. These train operating companies provide fast services to Brighton and the South Coast and to London.

played three seasons with the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). He is notable for his NHL debut at the age of 36, making him one of the oldest rookies in professional hockey history. Playing career Brooks had a long minor league career which included seven seasons for the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League (AHL), and shared the Harry \\"Hap\\" Holmes Memorial Award for lowest goals against average in the AHL with teammate Dan Bouchard in 1972. In the 1972–73 NHL season, the Bruins, who owned his rights, lost several goaltenders: top prospect Bouchard to expansion, star Gerry Cheevers to the World Hockey Association and veteran Eddie Johnston to a trade with the Toronto Maple Leafs. This opened the door for Brooks' recall as the backup goaltender. He excelled swiftly, matching a NHL record set by Bruins' goaltender Tiny Thompson in the 1920s for the longest consecutive winning streak by a goaltender, 14 games (since surpassed by Patrick Lalime). Brooks played for the Bruins from 1972 until 1975, after which, upon the return of Cheevers to the organization, he played a single season for the Bruins' AHL Rochester Americans farm team before retiring. Playing for a powerhouse team that regularly finished around the top of the league standings, he compiled a career record of 37 wins, and only 7 losses and 6 ties with a goals against average of 2.63. His career winning percentage is one of the highest recorded for goalies with 50 or more decisions. Post- playing career After his retirement, Brooks was a longtime executive for the Bruins' farm team in Providence, leaving that post in 2000. He currently manages operations of Schneider Arena on the campus of Providence College.

Life Few details of Ugolino's life are known. His father Rinaldo, Lord of Sarnano in the Marches, belonged to an ancient and noble family from which had sprung the famous Countess Matilda of Tuscany. Ugolino entered the Order of Friars Minor at the age of sixteen. He served his novitiate at the convent of Roccabruna, but passed most of his life at the convent of Santa Maria in Monte Giorgio, whence he is often called Ugolino of Monte Giorgio. In 1295 he was chosen Bishop of Abruzzi (Teramo) under Pope Celestine V, but before his consecration Celestine had resigned and Boniface VIII, who suspected Ugolino as belonging to the zelanti, annulled the appointment with the bull In supremae dignitatis specula. Nearly fifty years later he was elected provincial of Macerata.Robinson, Paschal. \\"Ugolino Brunforte.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 3.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 15 June 2016 Fioretti Most scholars are now agreed that Ugolino was the author of the Fioretti, or Little Flowers of St. Francis, in their original form. Ugolino was probably one of several collectors of traditions in the Marches. The Fioretti appears to have been written sometime between 1322 and 1328.Cuthbert O. S. F. C., Life of St. Francis of Assisi, Longmans, Green, 1914 In some ways the Fioretti says as much about its author as its subject. \\"Ugolino, it is true, draws himself when he draws his master.

Francisci et Sociorum Ejus, edited by Paul Sabatier in Collection d’Études (Paris, 1902, IV), an approximation to it which may be considered on the whole as representing the original of the Fioretti. That Ugolino was the principal compiler of the Actus seems certain; how far he may be considered the sole author of the Fioretti is not so clear. His labour, which consisted chiefly in gathering the flowers for his bouquet from written and oral local tradition, appears to have been completed before 1328.

International Journal of Robotics Research, 25(3), p 243-259, March 2006, Sage press. is a miniature bipedal robot which belongs to the class of limit cycle walkers. Instead of using a central pattern generator it uses reflexes which generate the gait. The reflexes are triggered by ground contact sensors in the feet which then activate the motors. The generation of the walking gait is straightforward: when a foot touches the ground the other leg is lifted upwards so that the robot falls forward. This then causes this leg to touch the ground and so forth. The walking speed can be improved by means of reinforcement learning because there are only a few parameters in this scheme. RunBot was built in 2005 by Tao Geng as part of his PhD under supervision of Prof Woergoetter and after an idea by Dr Porr to use a walking robot to benchmark reflex based reinforcement learning rules. Its movements and adaptability are based on the work of neurophysiologist Nikolai Bernstein.

Design The locomotion system is kept simple with four motors: one on each of two knees, one on each of two hips. The sensory system is of similar simplicity, with the ability to detect the ground contact and the angles of the hips/knee motors. The motors are controlled by force and not by angle.

B. Priestley's 1965 novel of the same name and starred Colin Firth, John Castle and Laurence Olivier. Produced by Granada Television, it was shown as a serial, and premiered on the UK's ITV network between 24 October and 5 December 1986. Plot After the death of his mother, Richard Herncastle (Colin Firth) is offered a job by his uncle, his mother's brother. Nick Ollanton is a stage conjurer in variety theatre and Richard joins the act where he meets the other members of the team and the rest of the acts on the bill as they travel around Britain appearing at the Empires, the old variety theatres that have since vanished. He becomes our eyes as he experiences the last few months of peace before World War One breaks out and changes the world forever. During the course of the seven episodes (eight hours), Firth's character, young Richard Herncastle, sees the \\"whole wide world\\" from backstage at the music hall variety shows with which the magic act travels, just as his uncle Nick (John Castle) has promised—hilarity, beauty, love, lust, fear, despair. Richard comes of age just as the world enters the fateful year of 1914—the outbreak of World War I, when the greatest of all disappearing acts becomes imminent: the disappearance of millions. The series has the second to last appearance of Olivier as a fading comedian named Harry Burrard, who has long since lost his audience and his comic abilities. Harry should have retired years before, however he has nowhere else to go and his brain is collapsing into paranoia. The role is a sort of older version of Olivier's Archie Rice, from The Entertainer (1960).

She attended St. Leonard's School for Girls at St Andrews, Scotland. She became a production assistant, learning her craft with Murray Grigor and Patrick Higson. During this time she met musician and sculptor, Allan Ross whom she married on 4 July 1978. Her career in film progressed through one of the earliest films made for Channel Four, The Work They Say Is Mine, to a cameo appearance in Gregory's Girl. During this time, Thomson and Ross moved to a farmhouse at Avonbridge, setting up Avonbridge Film Productions and producing commercials on which future directors and producers cut their teeth. At the Scottish Film Production Fund, which she ran for two years, she secured funding for Margaret Tait's film, Blue Black Permanent. In 1991, Thomson was appointed director of the Edinburgh International Film Festival (EIFF). Thomson took over the Festival and during her three years at the helm brought stability back to the organisation. In the 1990s, Thomson and Ross moved to York Road in Edinburgh. With the move came a new working partnership. Together they devised, pitched for and won many commissions for installations, theatre pieces, and award statuettes. For 12 years they provided the Viking longship, burnt annually on Calton Hill in culmination of the Torchlight Procession which heralds in Edinburgh's four-day Hogmanay celebration. In later years, she worked on script development and consultancy. She was a tireless worker for BAFTA Scotland, serving on its committee for many years. She supported the Edinburgh Film Focus from its inception and played a key role in advisory panels. The most recent meeting, she chaired from a wheelchair with indomitable style. She was chair of the Boilerhouse Theatre Company, a contributor to the List magazine and to BBC Scotland and was a board member and UK representative on the European producers' programme, EAVE.

An example is the electrostatic precipitator used in coal-fired power plants to treat exhaust gas, removing small particles that cause air pollution. Electrostatic separation is a process that uses electrostatic charges to separate crushed particles of material. An industrial process used to separate large amounts of material particles, electrostatic separating is most often used in the process of sorting mineral ore. This process can help remove valuable material from ore, or it can help remove foreign material to purify a substance. In mining, the process of crushing mining ore into particles for the purpose of separating minerals is called beneficiation. Generally, electrostatic charges are used to attract or repel differently charged material. When electrostatic separation uses the force of attraction to sort particles, conducting particles stick to an oppositely charged object, such as a metal drum, thereby separating them from the particle mixture. When this type of beneficiation uses repelling force, it is normally employed to change the trajectory of falling objects to sort them into different places. This way, when a mixture of particles falls past a repelling object, the particles with the correct charge fall away from the other particles when they are repelled by the similarly charged object. An electric charge can be positive or negative — objects with a positive charge repel other positively charged objects, thereby causing them to push away from each other, while a positively charged object would attract to a negatively charged object, thereby causing the two to draw together. Experiments showing electrostatic sorting in action can help make the process more clear. To exhibit electrostatic separation at home, an experiment can be conducted using peanuts that are still in their shells. When the shells are rubbed off of the peanuts and gently smashed into pieces, an electrostatically charged device, like a comb rubbed quickly against a wool sweater, will pick up the peanut shells with static electricity. The lightweight crushed shells that are oppositely charged from the comb easily move away from the edible peanut parts when the comb is passed nearby. The electrostatic separation of conductors is one method of beneficiation; another common beneficiation method is magnetic beneficiation. Electrostatic separation is a preferred sorting method when dealing with separating conductors from electrostatic separation non- conductors. In a similar way to that in which electrostatic separation sorts particles with different electrostatic charges magnetic beneficiation sorts particles that respond to a magnetic field. Electrostatic beneficiation is effective for removing particulate matter, such as ash from mined coal, while magnetic separation functions well for removing the magnetic iron ore from deposits of clay in the earth.

He played for eight seasons in the Canadian Football League and was a member of the 95th Grey Cup championship team with the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He also played for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Toronto Argonauts, and Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He wore uniform number 30 in honour of his grandfather, who also wore #30 for the Vancouver College Fighting Irish. High school and university years After playing at Vancouver College, he joined the UBC Thunderbirds of the CIAU for the 1996 season. In 1997, he moved on to play for the Abbotsford Air Force of the Canadian Junior Football League (CJFL) where he was an All-Star at safety. In 1998, he tore his ACL and returned to play the rest of the season three games later. That season, he was awarded the BCFC Defensive Player of the Year. After a successful surgery he returned to play 5 months later in a top level soccer league in Burnaby. Jamie then played in the CIAU for the Saskatchewan Huskies in 1999 before moving back to the CJFL with Abbotsford for a third year in 2000. He was drafted by the BC Lions in the 2001 CFL Draft but returned to the CIAU to play for the Manitoba Bisons. With Manitoba in 2001, Boreham was named a CIS All-Canadian at both Free Safety and Punter and helped lead the Bisons to the 37th Vanier Cup where they lost to Saint Mary's Huskies. In 2002, Boreham re-tore his ACL in the second game of the year (4th play of the game) but went on to finish the game and the season without missing a single play. He re-wrote the Manitoba record book by scoring 114 points in 2001 and 97 in 2002. Boreham is one of only a few players that have been recognized as an All Canadian at 3 different positions (Free Safety, Kicker, Punter). Professional career Boreham was drafted by his hometown BC Lions with the 16th overall selection in the 2001 CFL Draft. He attended training camp with the team in 2001, but was released and returned to play CIAU football. His rights were traded to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and he attended training camp with the Blue Bombers in 2002 and 2003, but was released before the start of the regular season both times. He then joined for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and played with the team from 2004 to 2006 as both their punter and placekicker. In 2007, Boreham was traded to the Saskatchewan Roughriders. The Roughriders went on to win the 95th Grey Cup that year with Boreham as their punter. He played two more years with the team until he was replaced by Louie Sakoda late in the 2009 season. On May 2, 2010, Boreham was traded to the Toronto Argonauts along with the 2nd and 4th overall picks in the 2010 CFL Draft in exchange for the 1st and 8th overall picks in the same draft. He was released by the Argonauts on February 17, 2011. In 2010, Boreham set a CFL record for kickoff average over a season. On September 7, 2011, Boreham was re-signed by the Roughriders. He was acquired by the Bombers from the Roughriders on October 2, 2011. He played in three regular season games and two post-season games, including the 99th Grey Cup, but was released on December 9, 2011. On October 25, 2012, Boreham was again signed by Roughriders, after Christopher Milo, the Roughriders punter, had gotten injured two games before. On November 1, 2012, Boreham, 7 days after re- joining the Roughriders, he tore his ACL for the third time and retired his CFL career. Coaching career On December 27, 2018, Boreham was named as head coach of the Okanagan Sun of the CJFL. Personal life Boreham served as a teacher at Immaculata Regional High School in Kelowna from 2016 to 2017. He is also a coach of the Notre Dame Jugglers in Vancouver.

Biography Guerri was born in Tarquinia, and studied at the inter-diocesan Seminary of Montefiascone, Seminary of Viterbo, Pontifical Roman Seminary, Pontifical Lateran University, and the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare. Ordained to the priesthood on 30 March 1929, he finished his studies in 1931, when he began pastoral work in Tarquinia. Guerri then served as Administrator of the Pontifical Urbaniana University from 1937 to 1941. He was raised to the rank of a Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on 11 April 1940, and later a Domestic Prelate of His Holiness 19 June 1949. He was also an official (1941–1946) and substitute secretary (1946–1948) of the Institute for Works of Religion in the Roman Curia. On 9 March 1948, Guerri was named Pro-Secretary of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See, becoming its full Secretary on 1 January 1951. He was later made a canon of St. Peter's Basilica on 25 April 1952. Named Secretary of the Central Preparatory Commission on 22 June 1960, Guerri was administrative secretary of the Second Vatican Council from 1960 to 1965. He was made Secretary of the Administration of the Patrimony of Holy See (7 May 1968) before becoming Pro-President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State on 6 November 1968. On 11 April 1969, in advance of his cardinalatial promotion, Guerri was appointed Titular Archbishop of Trebia. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 27 April from Cardinal Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, with Bishops Joseph Mark McShea and Plinio Pascoli, serving as co-consecrators, in the chapel of the Lateran Seminary. Shortly afterwards, Pope Paul VI created him Cardinal-Deacon of SS. Nome di Maria al Foro Troiano in the consistory of 28 April 1969. Cardinal Guerri was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the conclaves of August and October 1978, which selected Popes John Paul I and John Paul II respectively. After ten-years' standing as a Cardinal Deacon, he opted to become a Cardinal Priest, with the same titular church, on 30 June 1979. He resigned as Pro-President of Vatican City State on 26 September 1981, following almost fourteen years of service. Cardinal Guerri died in Vatican City, at age 86. He is buried in his family's chapel at the cemetery of Tarquinia.

New York University Press. p. 13 During the time when Neolithic and Copper cultures were starting to appear, Mediterranean Panonian cultures began to mix. Herzegovina was highly influenced by the impresso ceramics from the Western Mediterranean, as seen in Green Cave near Mostar, Čairi near Stolac, Lisičići near Konjic and Peć Mlini near Grude. In the upper regions of the Bosna river and the Northeastern parts of Bosnia (Obre I near Kakanj) the local culture was influenced by Adriatic cultures in the South and the Starčević culture in the Northeast. Original expressions of that culture are ceramic pots on four legs, called Rhyton. They are also found in the Danilo culture on the Croatian coast. Because of these influences, Kakanj culture is considered part of a wide circle of Neolithic tribes that followed a cult of life force (from northern Italy, Dalmatia and Epirus to Aegean). Butmir Culture near Sarajevo is distinctive with fine glazed ceramics and miscellaneous geometrical decorations, often spirals.W. Radymský / M.

Monumental city walls of Daorson near Stolac, 4th century BC.From the 7th century BC onwards, bronze was replaced by iron, and only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. The bronze culture of the Illyrians, an ethnic group with a distinct art form, started to organize itself in what is today Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Different Illyrian tribes, under the influence of Halstat cultures from the North, formed original regional centers. With the notable exception of Pod near Bugojno in the upper valley of the Vrbas River, nothing is known of their settlements. In eastern Bosnia in the cemeteries of Belotić and Bela Crkva, the rites of inhumation and cremation are attested, with skeletons in stone cists and cremations in urns. Metal implements appear here side by side with stone implements. Most of the remains belong to the Middle Bronze Age. A very important role played their death cult, evidence of which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies. Japodian tribes (found around Bihać) produced heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foils. In the 4th century BC, the first Celts arrived in the region, bringing with them the technique of the pottery wheel, new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. However, their influence on Bosnia and Herzegovina's art is negligible. =Antiquity= Silver fibula cross from 7th century found on Buško Blato lake in Herzegovina. Stone baptistery from Drinovci near Grude, 4th century. The Neretva Delta in the South was heavily dominated by Hellenistic influences of the Daors, an Illyrian tribe. Their capital was Daorson in Ošanići near Stolac, the main center of Ancient culture in B&H.; Romans subdued the Illyrians in the first century BC, with the Illyrian provinces turning into provinces of Rome and Byzantium. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romans built several small temples decorated with reliefs. The complex of step sanctuary in Gradac near Posušje from year 184 AD had marble temple dedicated to recently deceased emperor Marcus Aurelius. Late Roman art in B&H; is marked most dominantly expressed by the construction of villas, Christian mausoleums, basilicas and oratories like the Mausoleum in Šipovo near Jajce and Villa MogorjeloAnswers.com near Čapljina as well as sculptures.Ancient monuments - National archeological museum in Sarajevo Medieval art in Bosnia and Herzegovina Stećak from Radimlja, 13th century. Illumination from Hrvoje's Missal, Split, 1404. In Bosnia and Herzegovina the Romanesque influence came from Croatia although it was never fully accepted and thus only adopted some elements from it. Influences of Gothic art in the 14th century are represented by preaching orders and knightly culture. In Bosnian culture, religion and nobility were the main perpetuating factors. From the earliest times of Bosnian Kingdom the nobility was buried in large necropolises near roads with graves marked by monumental tombstones (stećak). A Stećak was sometimes engraved with reliefs showing all sorts of motifs, from figurative to symbols, and sometimes writings in Bosnian Cyrillic. They are strongly linked to the Bosnian Church and most of the motifs are derived from its particular belief system, although some are also derived from Romanesque (crosses, arcades with semi-circular arches, son, half-moon etc.) and Gothic (arcades with sharp arches, knight riders, shields, swords, lilies etc.) art of the West. The two most extraordinary examples of illuminated manuscripts from medieval Bosnia are Hval’s missionary in Zagreb, a lavishly decorated manuscript with many miniatures. Misal Hrvoja Vukčića Hrvatinića - a liturgical book of the Bosnian duke and ruler of Dalmatia - Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, today in Istanbul, is colourfully painted with many details of knightly culture. Both were painted in Split, Croatia. Ottoman art in Bosnia and Herzegovina alt= In the 16th century, all of Bosnia was under Ottoman, extinguishing the Western influence of renaissance and later baroque art from the region. The only places where some Western art remained was in Franciscan monasteries in Visoko, Kreševo, Franciscan monastery in Fojnica, Franciscan monastery in Kraljeva Sutjeska etc. However, the Ottoman period opened a new era in B&H; art, that of Islamic Art which flourished until the 19th century. At that time three constant art traditions coexisted in B&H;: Catholic-Western, Orthodox-Byzantine and the dominating Ottoman-Islamic one. The Ottomans were quickly developing urban cities upon their conquest of B&H;, enriched by Islamic and Byzantine influences. For example, in Foča in the 16th century, the Ottomans built 17 mosques, 29 public fountains, 6 public baths (hamam) and 13 caravanserai motels (han). Sarajevo is an example of a non-urban open city where the most important buildings are organized around one veining street, a čaršija (Persian chahar-su meaning all four sides). In Sarajevo the largest is famous Baščaršija with shops of 50 different crafts from the 15th century. Islamic manuscripts, decorated in the Persian style with Islamic calligraphy, and many remain in Bosnian libraries to this day. In the 16th century, the Jews expelled from Spain came to Sarajevo, where they were allowed to settle. Beside their important influence on Bosnian culture, they brought with them a luxuriously decorated manuscript called Sarajevo Haggadah from the 14th century, which is now housed in the Sarajevo museum. The bridge is an important part of Islamic art, not only because of the great skill required of an architect, but because of its symbolic meaning a mediator between Heaven and Earth. One of the most famous examples is the Old Bridge in Mostar, built by Hajredin, a pupil of the famous architect Mimar Sinan from Istanbul. In Bosnian Islamic architecture, stone is reserved for religious, public buildings and fortifications, while private houses were built out of wood and ćerpić (native simple bonding material made of clay and straw). With often console constructions of the upper floors, these houses allowed for more open spaces and large windows. When the power of Ottomans started to descend in the middle of the 17th century, so did the influence of Islamic art in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Art in the Austro-Hungarian period National Library in Sarajevo The Sarajevo Academy of Arts, on the bank of the Miljacka After Bosnia became part of Austro-Hungarian, the region's art scene witnessed an intensification of activity as cities modernized and changed in structure. Architecture was dominated by eclectic pseudo styles like classicism, neo- renaissance, neo-baroque, and even neo-Romanesque as well as neo-gothic. A unique pseudo style is the“oriental eclectic” style (also referred to \\"Pseudo- Moorish style\\"), based on Moorish architecture found in Southern Spain and Egypt. The style contrasted markedly with the urban ambient of Bosnian cities at the time, as can be seen in Sarajevo (National Library and City Hall), Mostar Gymnasium and Travnik (Retirement Home). The first Bosnian artists were educated in large European academies in Vienna, München, Prag, Krakow, Budapest and Paris, thanks to scholarships of cultural societies like “Prosvjeta” and “Napredak”. Artists like Atanasije Popović, Lazar Drljača, Gabrijel Jurkić, Branko Radulović, Petar Šain etc., are influenced by academism with slight touches of impressionism, art nouveau, and pointillism. After the Great Exhibition of Bosnian Artists in 1917, the native born artists have prevailed. Modern styles that entered B&H; were expressionism and Cézannes-ism. Art in the Yugoslavian Kingdom After the end of World War I, the society of artists from SHS (state of Serbians, Croats and Slovenians) was created and held numerous exhibitions and artistic gatherings like the Blažuj colony of Vladimir Becić. Participants o were Roman Petrović and Jovan Bijelić, both with abstract proclivities, while Karlo Mijić was devoted to colouristic landscapes. However, art production in B&H; was severely restricted, leading many artists to never retur to B&H; from their studies in Zagreb and Beograd, while many were leaving the country. The first renewal happened with the “Group of Four” and “engaged art” of Roman Petrović and his circle, “The children of the Street”. Mijić and Đoko Mazalić founded an art association called “Krug” (The Circle) with strong focus on urban aesthetics of nature. Vojo Dimitrijević painted “Spain in ‘37”, a representative artwork of colouristic expression with traces of Picasso and Chagall. In the 1930s, architects were influenced by ideas of functionalism, humane architecture and Bauhaus. Those buildings were uniting function, content and form, without unnecessary plastic decoration, and with a simple rhythm of windows and modern constructions. Art in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Right after World War II, Communist Yugoslavia was founded, which allowed artists to find a new expression through the themes of Revolution and War. Prominent representatives of this are Ismet Mujezinović and Branko Šotra. Architecture was also under the direct influence of Socialistic architecture, but never reached the monumentality of the original works. In the 1950s, art slowly transformed to a more abstract outlook, based on industrial and economic motives. The first to do so was sculptor Mirko Ostoja who replaced classical modeling with iron welding. Even the Communist State changed its feeling toward modern art by commissioning large abstract monuments dedicated to famous battles in The War (Sutjeska, Kozara, Makljen etc.). Young architects gathered around professor Juraj Neidhardt, and were trying to connect modern architecture with B&H; tradition and surroundings. The result were buildings like The Mostar Mall,“Razvitak” ,in 1970 by A. Paljaga or Jajce Mall in 1976 by R. Jadrić, Dž. Karić and N. Kurto. In the 1960s many architects were leaving traditional boundaries and made important buildings in the manner of functionalism: The telecommunication building in Addis Abeba by Ivan Štraus and Zdravko Kovacević, or “Skenderija” Hall in Sarajevo by Živorad Janković and Halid Muhasilović are exemplary.http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/course/4/4.175/OldFiles/www/center_home_sarajevo_contemporary.htm In the 1970s, an art expression inspired by old Bosnian culture and tradition appeared in the graphic work of Dževad Hozo and in the paintings of Mehmed Zaimović, Seid Hasanefendić and Mersad Berber. Quite opposite to that, the urban expression of Ismar Mujezinović is more related to modern film montage and photo-optics, while Braco Dimitrijević was a Conceptual artist who worked mainly outside B&H.; An example of architecture in the 1980s is the Holiday Inn Hotel built in 1983 and the “Unis” Twin Towers built in Sarajevo in 1986, designed by Ivan Štraus.

Bosmal City Center under construction in 1999 Cultural preservation is under way in Bosnia and Herzegovina which can be seen with the most recent reconstruction of Stari Most in Mostar and many other structures of cultural and historical significance which were damaged or destroyed in the war. Commercial construction in the years following the Bosnian War has seen a boom in Sarajevo. Sarajevo is one of the cities with the most construction in southeastern Europe. The Unis Twin Towers have been renovated completely. On the site of the former Oslobodjenje Towers, the Avaz towers have now been constructed. In the Hrasno residential area, the Bosnian Company Bosmal has constructed the Bosmal City Center, which includes the tallest set of twin towers in the Balkans at 120 meters each. The Avaz Twist Tower located in Marijin Dvor, Sarajevo, is the tallest tower in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the new headquarters for Avaz, the most popular Bosnia and Herzegovina newspaper company.  See also  * Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina Notes References * Malcolm, Noel (1994).

It is named after Colonel Henry Darnall, a wealthy Roman Catholic planter, who was the Proprietary Agent of Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore and who served for a time as Deputy Governor of the Province. The house itself was built c. 1742 by a merchant named James Wardrop who bought some of Darnall's land from Eleanor Darnall Carroll and her husband Daniel Carroll, a politician and wealthy planter. Wardrop enslaved 32 people at the house. Today, Darnall's Chance houses the Darnall's Chance House Museum, a historic house museum which opened to the public in 1988. History Colonel Henry Darnall (1645–1711) =Origins= The tract of land the house sits on was patented in 1704 by Col. Henry Darnall (1645–1711), a wealthy Maryland Roman Catholic planter, Proprietary Agent of Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore and, for a time, Deputy Governor of Maryland. However, during the Protestant Revolution of 1689, Darnall's proprietarial army was defeated by the Puritan army of Colonel John Coode, and he was stripped of his numerous offices. When Col. Darnall died in 1711, he owned in Prince George's County, as well as holdings in four other counties. The property of what became known as Darnall's Chance passed through his family to his granddaughter Eleanor Darnall, who married Daniel Carroll I in 1727. Their family was reared on the large landholding and plantation. Two Carroll sons were prominent members of colonial and early United States society: Daniel Carroll became a politician in the Continental Congress and Maryland Senate, and member of the Constitutional Convention; and John Carroll became the first Roman Catholic bishop in the United States, and founder of Georgetown University. In 1741, the Carrolls sold 6 acres of their land to James Wardrop, a Scottish merchant. Wardrop built a 15-room brick dwelling house within a year, originally a -story, Flemish bond brick house. It is that house that currently stands on the property. After living at Darnall's Chance as a bachelor for six years, Wardrop married 22-year-old Lettice Lee, whose father Philip was a member of the Lee family of Westmoreland County, Virginia. =Nineteenth century= John Wollaston In the mid-19th century, the house was remodeled to two stories, of stuccoed brick, with Italianate and Greek Revival stylistic elements. The major alterations to the property were probably carried out under the ownership of Edward Grafton W. Hall, who owned it between 1857 and 1887. =Modern era= The house and property were acquired by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1974, for administrative offices, but was later renovated and reopened as a house museum. Darnall's Chance was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The official name for the house, the Buck House, is for a late-20th-century owner, Harry Buck, Sr. After renovations and opening as a house museum, the property was subsequently renamed Darnall's Chance, after its first owner. In 1986, the entire second floor and roof were removed, and the house was reconstructed to its 18th- century appearance. Two years later, it opened as Darnall's Chance House Museum. Darnall's Chance House Museum Darnall's Chance House Museum is a historic house museum which opened to the public in 1988. It is operated by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. The tour at Darnall's Chance focuses on the life of Lettice Lee, as she lived in the house for almost thirty years, married three times, and was an unusual 18th-century woman. It also includes more general information on the other women who lived at Darnall's Chance and in Prince George's County at that time. The house is open for tours on Friday from noon to 4 pm, Sunday from noon to 4 pm, and at other times by appointment. Public programs offered at the Museum include tea lessons for young ladies, a pirate-for-a-day program, and an annual gingerbread house contest and show. The Museum rents its tented patio, which has a capacity of 125, for weddings and other events. Burial vault During 1987, an underground vault was discovered on the property. The vault when discovered, was filled with 8 feet of trash from the 18th and 19th century. Under the trash were found nine sets of human remains: three adults and six children. It was later determined that five of those remains were of native- born Americans. It was concluded that the people died of various illnesses.Berg, S. (1999, Mar 10).

Together with the neighbouring villages of Laytown and Bettystown it comprises the census town of Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington, with a combined population of 10,889 at the 2011 Census and 11,872 (along with Donacarney) at the 2016 Census. Mornington is part of the wider area collectively known as East Meath. The large townland of is bound on the north by the River Boyne estuary and on the east by the Irish Sea. The townland extends along the seashore to Bettystown village and includes part of that village up to and including The Neptune Hotel. The townland, part of the civil parish of Colpe, touches on other townlands: Betaghstown to the south, Colp East and Colp West to the west and Donacarney Great and Donacarney Little to the south and west. Stameen lies to the west. Baltray, Beaulieu and Banktown lie across the Boyne. Mornington can also refer to a larger area, a half-parish, within the Laytown-Mornington Roman Catholic parish established in 1986,http://www.sacredheartlaytown.com/home and formerly part of the parish of St. Mary's in Drogheda. Mornington was also a former post office sub-district and used by a wider area for address purposes up to the 1980s. Maiden Tower and the Lady's Finger Lady's Finger Situated on the south bank at the mouth of the River Boyne are two structures, the Maiden Tower and the Lady's Finger, which served as navigational aids for ships entering the River Boyne prior to the 1765 walls being built. A ship approaching the river mouth would be lined up to safely enter the narrow channel when the view of the Lady's Finger was obscured behind the tower. The view of Maiden-Tower near Drogheda, Co:y Meath by S. Walker show their relationship on 11 June 1783. Both are listed in the Record of Protected Structures (ID Nos. MH021-124 and MH021-121) in the Meath County Development Plan 2013-2019. The Maiden Tower which stands 60 foot high was built during the reign of Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, who came to the throne in 1558. It is suggested that it got its name from this association and Sir William R. Wilde in his book \\"The Beauties of the Boyne ...\\" (1849) mentions this as a conjecture in his time. The tower was already in existence by 1582 when it was proposed to build at Ringsend a tower of such height and strength as shall be of a perpetual continuance like the tower at Drogheda.de Courcy, J. The Liffey in Dublin. (Dublin, 1996) p. 243http://www.meath.ie/Tourism/MeathsTownandVillages/Mornington/ The tower is mentioned in the Charter granted to the town of Drogheda by James 1st in 1609, in reference to the fisheries of the town:- \\"we give grant and confirm to the Mayor, Sheriffs, Burgesses & Commons…all the water of the Boyne and the fishing and fisheries thence in within and on each side of the same water, from the waters of the franchises…from the west part of Drogheda to the sea beyond the tower called Maidenstower on the east side…\\". Manuscript copy of translation of Grant by James I to the Corporation of Drogheda, dated 1819, in the archives of Corporation of Drogheda In the Down Survey of 1656-58, the tower is indicated as 'Maiden tower' on the county map and as 'Mayden Tower' on the map of Colp parishhttp://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey- maps.php#bm=Duleek&c;=Meath&p;=Killcarvan. In place of the Lady's Finger, both the barony and parish maps show a cross on a stepped plinth. At a General Assembly of Drogheda Corporation on 11th January 1683 it was ordered that \\"Mr. Mayor cause Maiden Tower to be rough cast (i.e. rendered) at the chardge of the Corporation\\".Gogarty, T. Council Book of the Corporation of Drogheda. (Drogheda, 1915), p. 205 In 1775, the Corporation petitioned the Lord Lieutenant regarding \\"...a tower called maiden Tower...and also one other small tower...which towers are of singular service to mariners who navigate vessels bound to the port of Drogheda...that same were now much out of repair and became less conspicuous, the bright colouring being worn off, that they had lately employed persons to repair said towers, but were obstructed by James Brabazon, tenant to Lord Mornington whose estate is contiguous to said towers\\".D’Alton, J. The history of Drogheda, with its environs; and an introductory memoir of the Dublin and Drogheda railway, (Dublin, 1844) vol. 2, p. 366. The tower was built as a warning beacon to sailors and marked the mouth of the River Boyne. At the topmost reaches of the tower, one can command an extensive view over land and sea. Access to this parapet is by spiral steps tapering towards the top and through the barrel-vault at the top of the stairs. It is also believed to have acted as a look-out tower during the Elizabethan Wars with Spain (1585–1603) to give advance warning of approaching enemy ships. Publicly accessible until the mid-1990s, when a metal grill was installed in the raised doorway, the tower was vandalised in 2003 when the metal grill was removed. A solid metal door was subsequently erected by the owners, blocking entry to the tower. There are various folk stories about the tower and pillar. One were a faithful lady, awaiting the return of her husband, falls from the tower when an incorrect flag on his returning ship mistakenly signalled his death, echoes the fate of Aegeus the father of Theseus. The lady's finger was then supposedly built by the returned husband in memory of his wife. In 1819 a strange old woman, who had lived abroad for many years, took up residence at the top of the tower. She spent her time at her spinning wheel under a makeshift sail roof set up by local fishermen. She developed a reputation as a local hermit, donating her spinning work to the local church and became known simply as the 'lady of the tower' having refused to give her name. In the severe winter of 1821 she had to abandon the tower and died soon after in a charitable institution in Drogheda. Beside the Maiden Tower is the former RNLI Lifeboat station, in operation between 1872 and 1926. A dwellinghouse until at least the late-1950s, it was subsequently derelict and roofless until 2003 when it was restored as a residence. In 2018 it was put up for sale in conjunction with the surrounding 31 acres of sand dunes on which a deepwater port had been proposed. The boathouse is a Protected Structure (ID No. MH021-123) in the Meath County Development Plan. In 2015 Harvey Keitel filmed part of an insurance commercial at the tower. Fisheries and River Boyne Traditional fishing boats at Mornington Mornington was traditionally a fishing village on the River Boyne based on salmon fishing and mussel dredging, however the nature of the area and of a fishing livelihood changed significantly at the time of \\"The Boom\\". By tradition St. Patrick blessed the fishermen at Inbhear Colpha, were the Colpe stream enters the Boyne in Mornington, as they gave him salmon when he asked for something to eat, in contrast to those on the Ainge, or Nanny Water whom he had cursed for being inhospitable. He said then the Mornington fishermen would always have fish. The fishery was known as the lord's fishery by the early Stuart period and in 1603 King James granted Sir George Carew, vice-Chamberlain of the Queen \\"the tithes of the fish of Mornanston in the parish of Colpe\\".Ward, Michael. 'Mornington alias Marinerstown', in \\"Journal of the Old Drogheda Society, No. 6\\" (1989)', p66 Drogheda was given and confirmed in its control of the Boyne and fisheries in 1609 (See above). The fishing by draft nets was done from around 1416 perches are shown on the 1907 OSI 25 inch map set stations and \\"Boyne salmon fishermen had a particular method of working which involved two men. One man stayed onshore holding a rope attached to the net, while the other rowed out into the river with the other end of the net. Once the whole net was spread out, the boatman rowed back to shore and the two men pulled the net to shore, trapping fish as it went\\".Leo Boyle, Salmon Fishing on the Boyne River, A Brief Synopsis of the Boyne River Salmon Fishery, www.patburnsphotography.net, accessed 16/4/2014 quoted at http://www.whytes.ie/i6Main.asp?Auction=20140526&Lot;=60 The salmon boats had a particular stern platform for holding the net. Fishing took place from February to August. In 2006 amid concerns of dwindling spawning salmon numbers, the decision was taken to ban draft net fishing. Of the 50 fishermen then with licenses only 14 remained on and \\"they came to an agreement with the Inland Fisheries Ireland to take part in a scientific experiment that tags fish caught in the nets, under the eye of fishing inspectors. They are then released, allowing them to head back upstream\\".Drogheda Independent 08/08/2012 Accessed at http://m.independent.ie/regionals/droghedaindependent/news/salmon- back-in-boyne-27168968.html Licences in former times were passed from father to son, with the equipment going with the licence. However current licences now run only for the life of the holder making them without commercial value and given the age profile of licence-holders and the delay in the resumption of fishing will inevitably lead to a situation where there are none left to resume the tradition. The tradition of mussel fishing, which existed for about 300 yearsBoyle, Leo. In \\"Remembering the Future: A Meath Coast Miscellany\\" edited by Brian Langan (Meath East Community Association, 2007), , has also been suspended since 2006. An initial halt took place in 1998, as the river channel was to be dredged, and while the beds were re-seeded the year afterwards with the expectation of harvesting in 2003 re-establishment was poor. Then in 2006, the Drogheda Port Company undertook a second silt dredging this time from Tom Roe's Point deepwater berth to the viaduct at Drogheda. The fishing involved a particular currach-style boat or punt (also called a pramSmylie, Mike. \\"Working the Irish Coast\\" (Nonsuch Ireland, 2009), , p. 226., or more commonly locally, a canoe) and a mussel rake with a twenty-foot pole, dredged by hand similar to that on the River Conwy in North Wales. These can be seen in these images of mussel dredging in the 1990s. Mussels were originally used as a food source in the Mornington-Baltray areas and only became a commercial fishery about 1902-1903Leo Boyle reported in Drogheda Independent, 8 September 2000. https://www.independent.ie/regionals/droghedaindependent/news/local- coastwatch-meeting-highlights-boyne-estuary-27124173.html. The season ran over the winter from October to April and raking took place about two hours before and after low tide. The collected mussels then were shovelled through a sieve to remove stones and seaweed and bagged in Hessian sacks which were sent to a processing factory in Wexford. Most were afterwards packed and exported to France. The point of land where the Boyne turns South-East before entering the sea is known locally as The Crook or Crooke, and in the nineteenth-century, at the Maiden Tower a pool called the Long Reach, extending a quarter of a mile inland, was where vessels could lie at low water.Lewis, Samuel. A topographical dictionary of Ireland, under Colpe-cum-Mornington. 1837 A fish- meal factory was set up at the Crooke in 1968http://oar.marine.ie/bitstream/10793/488/1/Irish%20Fisheries%20Leaflet%20No%2063.pdf by a Scottish concern with support from Bord Iascaigh Mhara to process fish from the herring industry out of Clogherhead and Skerries. Its construction impinged on the customary right of fishermen to draw their boats up at that point. It wound up in the late-1970s following several years of heavy fishing by vessels which led to Herring stocks in the Irish Sea collapsing.http://fish2fork.com/en_GB/news/news/collapsed-herring-fishery- certified-as-sustainable The private jetty continued to be regularly used by fishing boats from Clogherhead to moor up and the company was finally liquidated in 2003. The Irish Government bought the jetty and adjoining lands in 2001 for £170,000 to retain its use as a licensed location to land explosives in commercial quantities, chiefly for local quarrying enterprises, and munitions. Drogheda Port advanced plans to develop the mouth of the Boyne around the tower as a modern deepwater port facility in the late 1990s but the inability to locate the owner of the old boathouse there delayed the project. A reservation strip for a road corridor had already been laid into the County Meath development plan of the area which disallowed residential building along the proposed route from the Dublin Road. There was local opposition to the project until the lands were designated as the Boyne Estuary (1996)https://www.npws.ie/sites/default/files/protected- sites/natura2000/NF004080.pdf and Boyne Coast and Estuary SACs (Special Areas of Conservation) by Dúchas – The Heritage Service and this put paid to the plans. However initial dredging of the river channel took place in 1999–2000, and after renewed dredging in the channel of the river in 2006 the deepwater container and general cargo facility at Tom Roe's Point Terminal went ahead with EU money. Plans for a larger East Meath deep-water port shifted to the Gormanston/Bremore area at the same time. Thereafter much of the Mornington area in 2005 was rezoned by Meath County Council and has since been developed for new residential estates which changed the essentially rural nature of the area. The management of the River Boyne estuary channel by the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners (1790–1997) and their commercial successor Drogheda Port Company, since 1997, has been a feature of the last 150 years, with major dredging work beginning in the 1830s following the Alexander Nimmo report of 1826. This report was based on a survey of the estuary undertaken by John Benjamin Macneill. A recent EPA report states that \\"From Drogheda town to the sea at Mornington, the river has been trained by means of training walls constructed around the 1850s by the then Drogheda Harbour Commissioners. This captured the main river flow with estuarine polders being created north and south of the training walls. This important work had two effects in that it increased the tidal exit velocity and thereby produced a scouring effect and created a reserve of water from the estuarine polders to supplement the falling tide\\".http://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/migrated- files/en/Foreshore/ApplicationsandDeterminations/DroghedaPortCompany/ApplicationDetails/FileDownLoad,30306,en.pdf As part of this engineering the old bridge at Mornington previously had a lock gate which restricted tidal water entering the Colpe stream. Public transport Bus Éireann route 190 provides several daily services between Laytown and Drogheda via Bettystown and Mornington. Matthews Coaches provide commuter routes to Dublin which serve Donacarney Cross and Laytown, Bettystown and Julianstown. Mornington is served by rail by both Drogheda train station and Laytown train station. Religion Old Star of the Sea church of 1841 There is one church in Mornington, it is Roman Catholic, and was dedicated 27 August 1989 as the Star of the Sea (Irish: Réalt ná Mara) with work completed in 1991. Since the establishment of the Laytown-Mornington parish in 1986 the curate in Mornington has acted in a supportive capacity to the parish priest in Laytown. The present church is designed by Drogheda-based Turlough McKevitt Architects and built by MJ Duffy & Sons Ltd. in the late-1980s. It replaced the old 'Star of the Sea' church in the centre of the original village. The former church of 1841 is gabled-fronted, its main entrance facing the West, with a date plaque set above the door but also with a side entrance which was more commonly used. Inside on both sides of the main entrance, between the inner and outer doors, narrow curved stairs led up to the \\"Gallery\\". This was a slanting upper floor covering just over half of the church space. Here the choir sat and latecomers could sneak in after mass had started. A large confessional box was located on the right towards the rear under this floor. The church originally had the traditional ad orientem altar mounted into the East wall and following changes in the liturgy a later versus populum altar as well. A door to the sacristy led off to the right from the altar. Stained glass windows of the patron saints were transferred to the new church. The old church was built in the Gothic Revival style under the supervision of Thomas Hammond of Drogheda in 1839-1841 for the Rev. John Donnellan of St. Mary's ParishSee http://www.morningtonchurch.com/history.html on the buff overlooking the bridge at Mornington were a stream enters the Boyne. This original church site was previously the location of a small Penal-era chapel and prior to that a pre-Reformation church listed in the ecclesiastical taxation (1302–06) of Pope Nicholas IVCal. doc. Ire. 5, 252. The latter has a turret at the west end pierced for two bells. It was first recorded as being a ruin in 1622,Erlington, C. R. (ed.) 1847-64 The whole works of the Most Reverend James Ussher. 17 vols. Hodges and Smith, Dublin 1847-64, 1, lxviii and part of its remains can still be found in the old graveyard adjoining. The anonymous illustration \\"Mornington\\", a vignette on engraved title page of 'Life and campaigns of the Duke of Wellington'. Vol. I shows the old church and chapel before the building of the church of 1841.

This association can still be seen in the name of the local GAA Club, St. Colmcilles. The Martyrology of Tallaght, compiled _c._ 800 A.D., mentions a Saint Aithcáin of Inber ColpthaCathy Swift, 'Pagan monuments and Christian legal centres in early Meath' in Ríocht na Midhe, Vol. IX, No. 2 (1996), p. 24, n.35, nar' clói chathgreim ('whom no battle-might vanquished'), whose feast-day was 16 June. Any local tradition of him has gone. Devotion to another June saint, John the Baptist, 24 June, probably came with the Normans who were particularly attached to his cult. A former holy well dedicated to St. John is located in a marshy and wooded area known as \\"The Glen\\" near the new church. It is situated close to the Colpe stream at the base of a hill called Cnoc Bán. Its pattern was observed, until suppressed by a local priest, \\"up to the turn of the [twentieth] century by people seeking cures for eye and ear ailments. Buttons, pieces of clothing and other personal items were hung on an elder bush overhanging the well. Local tradition claimed that the herbs growing around the well had the virtue of curing coughs, skin infections and deafness\\". The well has a wall surround built into the side of the hill but is now choked with debris. A stone known as the mass rock stood beside the well. Mass was celebrated in this isolated location during the difficult times when the Penal Laws were in force. Traditionally wells dedicated to the saint in Ireland held a patron/pattern day on St John’s Eve (23 June) coinciding with the ancient celebration of mid summer. Current burials in the parish take place in Reilig Mhuire (Piltown Road Cemetery) which was opened in 1985. Sport Laytown and Bettystown Golf Club is situated in Mornington townland. St. Colmcilles, or Naomh Colmcille, is the local GAA club. Their facilities are located at Páirc Uí Rís in Piltown, near Bettystown.http://www.cilles.com Known as the \\"Blues\\", the club was founded in 1971 with the merger of earlier clubs 'Star of the Sea' and 'Shallon' in the East Meath area. Laytown and Bettystown Lawn Tennis Club, Golflinks Road, Bettystown, is also situated in Mornington. Education There is one primary school split into a girls and boys school in Donacarney which service Mornington. They are Realt Na Mara BNS and Realt Na Mara GNS.http://donacarneyschool.ie/http://www.realtnamaradonacarney.ie There is also a secondary school, Colaiste na hInse, located in Laytown, which services Mornington and the east Meath area.http://www.colaistenahinse.ie/ In 1837 a school of about 20 children was located in the 'small chapel at Mornington'. A Gothic style red-brick school which now serves as the local community centre was built in the 1870s at Donacarney Cross. Designed in 1872-3 by P.J. Dodd of Drogheda,http://www.dia.ie/architects/view/1530/DODD%2C+PATRICK+JOSEPH with an extension in 1885, it features separate doors for girls and boys at the front of the building. Its twentieth-century replacement, with a water tower, was demolished to make the site available for the present-day schools in the early 2010s. Artists The area has inspired many artists over the years. Views of the estuary and its fishermen, the beach and the Maiden Tower appear as subjects in watercolour, illustration and oils by various artists including Alexander Williams, Nano Reid, Ithell Colquhoun and more recently Richard Moore. The illustration \\"The lady's Finger & Maiden Tower, Co. of Eastmeath\\" an engraving based on a sketch by George Petrie appears as a plate in the antiquary Thomas Cromwell's Excursions through Ireland of 1820. Mornington Strand Mornington Strand consists of dunes, known locally since at least the mid-eighteenth century as The Burrows, and a wide sandy strand which extends south from the River Boyne towards Bettystown. The links course of Laytown and Bettystown Golf Club is situated within the Mornington dune-system. There are areas of soft sand close to the River Boyne training walls; warning signs erected at Bettystown warn of the danger. The intertidal sand and mudflats, and the Mornington sand dune systems, are included within the Boyne Coast and Estuary Special Area of Conservation (SAC) which extends along the coast from Bettystown to Termonfeckin.Bettystown/Laytown Beach Management Plan. Meath County Council, March 2017. The bodies of murder-victims were found here in 2007 and 2013. Myth and early history Inbher Colpa or Inber Colpthap. 457, Hogan, Edmund, Onamasticon Goedelicum, Williams & Norgate, 1910, reprinted, Four Courts, 2000, was the principal name in early medieval times for the mouth of the Boyne and in particular the area on its southern shore where hostium Colpdi, the port of Colpa, was located. The Inbher or tidal estuary of the Boyne, which extends inland as far as the confluence with the Mattock River, had a number of names in medieval Irish literature and was associated as a place of departure and arrival in the ancient legends and myths. The names often signify stories relating to drownings, a dangerous wave or tidal bore, overseas arrivals and corporeal remains found in the inter-tidal wrack of the estuary. Tráig Inbirp. 644, Hogan, Edmund, Onamasticon Goedelicum, Williams & Norgate, 1910, reprinted, Four Courts, 2000, or Tráig Indbir Colpap. 644, Hogan, Edmund, Onamasticon Goedelicum, Williams & Norgate, 1910, reprinted, Four Courts, 2000, , the Strand of Inbher Colpa, a counterpart to Mornington, was within the wider area of Tuath Inbhir (i mBregaib) between the Boyne and Nannyp. 652, Hogan, Edmund, Onamasticon Goedelicum, Williams & Norgate, 1910, reprinted, Four Courts, 2000, . The origin of the name is associated in myth with Colpa an Chlaidhimh (\\"of the Sword\\"), a son of Míl Espáine in the Milesian origin of the Irish, an invader who was drowned by a wave in the attempt to land, and by tradition is buried behind Colp church in a ringfort touching on Mornington's boundary. While Colpa drowned, Érimón, his eldest brother, made safe landing in this place and became one of the first Milesian High Kings of Ireland. An alternative Dindsenchas tradition associates the variant name Inber Colptha with the Máta, a massive aquatic creature which occupied a once submerged plain around Dundalk, Magh Muirthemne, and which was killed and dismembered on a stone, Liacc Benn, on top of Newgrange in Brú na Bóinne, by the Dagda and thrown into the Boyne. Its limb, shank or shinbone (colptha) reached the estuary giving name to Inber Colptha. The colptha probably called to mind the channel of the Boyne at this point and was a play on the original word Colpa. Áth Cliath, \\"the hurdled ford\\", the Irish name for Dublin, comes from the same Dindsenchas account referring to another part of the Máta. Other associations in myth include The Tragedy of the Sons of Tuireann, Togail Bruidne Dá Derga, Lebor Gabála Érenn, the lives of various saints, Acallam na Senórach, other Fenian Cycle tales and the Dindsenchas tradition, a body of literature in verse and prose form on the origin of famous places. The aetiological explanation for the Boyne itself was an out-surging of Nechtan's well on Carbury Hill which tore apart and drowned the goddess BoannMetrical Dindshenchas, Vol 3, poem 2: \\"Boand I\\" (ed. Edward Gwynn) at CELT., and in some versions also her lapdog Dabilla, in a flood of water before sweeping out to sea giving the generic name Inber Bóinne or Inber Bóindep. 457, Hogan, Edmund, Onamasticon Goedelicum, Williams & Norgate, 1910, reprinted, Four Courts, 2000, to the Boyne estuary. In Acallam na Senórach, _c._ 1200, the upper estuary near Mainistir Droichit Átha (Mellifont AbbeyAnn Dooley, The date and purpose of Acallam na Senórach in Éigse Vo. 34 (2004), p. 99-101.) is called Inber Bic Loingsigh, The Estuary of Becc the Exile, son of one Airist, King of the Romans. He is explained as having been drowned by a wave when invading Ireland here. The name may be an untraditional construct echoing and modifying the better known tradition of Colpa and linking to a more prestigious Roman figure as the Acallam also retains reference to Tond Indbir Colpa cruaidh, the hardp. 80, Harmon, Maurice (Translator), Dialogues of the Ancients of Ireland, Carysfort Press, 2009, or harshp. 98, Ann Dooley and Harry Roe (Translators), Tales of the Elders of Ireland, Oxford University Press, 1999, Wave of Inbher Colpa, in a poem section listing it as one of the famous waves of Ireland. The estuary is presented in Togail Bruidne Dá Derga as the principal maritime location in the peaceful times of the legendary king Conaire Mór: 'Now there were in his reign great bounties, to wit, seven ships in every June in every year arriving at Inver Colptha, and oakmast up to the knees in every autumn, and plenty of fish in the rivers Bush and Boyne in the June of each year, and such abundance of good will that no one slew another in Erin during his reign. And to every one in Erin his fellow's voice seemed as sweet as the strings of lutes. From mid-spring to mid-autumn no wind disturbed a cow's tail. His reign was neither thunderous nor stormy'..

The traditional boundary of the province of Ulster was the Boyne and its tributary the Blackwater, appearing as such in the Táin Bó Cúailnge.

Whatever the origin myth by historical times, in the sixth-century, the tribal grouping known as Ciannachta Breg were in place between Annagassan and Dublin centering on Duleek, the stone-church of St. Cianán.

The Ciannachta later came under the control of the Síl nÁedo Sláine and over time the Clann Cholmáin Kingdom of Meath. They were subject to their own bishop at Duleek from the fifth-century until the see was subsumed by the Diocese of Meath in the late twelfth-century. Later history The main surviving historic monuments in the area are a head and base of a sandstone high cross found at Colp, now in the Church of Ireland church at Julianstown, the Maiden Tower, built in the sixteenth-century (see above), and the ruined tower-house castle at Donacarney Cross. Another castle previously stood in Mornington townland beside Colpe as part of the medieval settlement cluster. Nothing now remains of it above ground. Mornington was separated from Colp in the early Norman period and given the status of a borough. It took its name from Robert le Mariner, a Norman proprietor, who had probably died before 1234 without heirs. The new name was in use by at least 1182 when Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath, ten years following his enfeoffment by Henry II with the lands of the Kingdom of Meath, granted its tithes to support the new foundation of the Augustinian Abbey at Colp. This was a cell of his favoured religious house of Llanthony situated on his estates in the Welsh vale of Ewyas. The name was well-established by the beginning of the 13th-century being known variously as Villa Roberti MarinariiReferenced in Riocht na Midhe journal (2016) (1211.Brooks, E.

In 1234 Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath, granted \\"the whole land which belonged to Christiana wife of Robert le Mariner in the town of Mariners in Ireland near the port of Drogheda to God and the [Cistercian] Abbey of St. Mary of Furness in England and the abbot and monks serving God there\\"Mills, J. and McEnery, M.J. 1916 Calendar of the Gormanston Register, (Dublin), 8. The opening up of Airgíalla to colonisation and the development of Drogheda in the 1180s and 1190s would have sidelined the settlement. Historian B.J. Graham notes that in 1235, \\"a burgage in the vill Marenariorium, now known as Mornington ... was included in a grant of land to [the Cistercian] Beaubec Abbey [which held a monastic farm at Beymore, east Meath]. At this time the settlement contained a church, a stone tower, a mill and some messuages, an inventory which makes it clear that, despite its borough status, the vill Marenariorum was no more than a manorial village in size or function\\"B.J. Graham, 'Anglo Norman Settlement in Meath', in \\"Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy: Archaeology, Culture, History, Literature\\", Vol. 75 (1975), p. 227. Despite close links and being surrounded on the landward side by the neighbouring and more extensive Manor of Colpe it remained a separate vill having its own church up to the sixteenth-century with 'Marynerton' being listed amongst the Irish possessions of Furness Abbey and Llanthony at the Suppression of the Monasteries in 1536.White, N.B. 1943 Extents of Irish monastic possessions, 1540-1541. Dublin. Irish Manuscripts Commission. P314, 319 Around this time Henry Draycott ( _c._ 1510–1572) an English-born Crown official and judge in sixteenth-century Ireland, who held a number of senior Government offices, became a substantial landowner in the Pale, with his principal estate at Mornington. He was a political ally of the Lord Deputy, Anthony St. Leger and acquired many former church properties in the Dissolution. His descendants quickly integrated within the Old English community of the Pale and remained one of the significant families in the area for the next 150 years. By 1603 Mornington was being considered part of the Civil Parish of Colpe. It appears as part of Colpe in the Civil Survey of 1654 and in Samuel Lewis's \\"Topographical Dictionary of Ireland\\" (1837) under Colpe, or Colpe-cum-Mornington. Mornington was the scene of one of the actions in March 1642 during the raising of the Siege of Drogheda of 1641-42 as the garrison undertook raids into the locality to disrupt the Northern rebels under Sir Phelim O'Neill surrounding the town. The garrison found the previous year's harvest still in the fields and John D'Alton in his history of Drogheda quotes Dean Nicholas Bernard how: The town of Drogheda then with great joy set to brewing the captured grain for beer \\"having drunk nothing but water for a week\\". In this raid they also burned: This missal and another book called the Black Book of Llanthony, both now lost, had previously belonged to the library of Henry Draycott.P.6. O'Sullivan, W.

It was believed locally to have been the site of a former monastery. The castle at Colpe, in Mornington townland, was captured by Lord Moore of Mellifont with part of the relief force from Dublin in this action. The Ozanam Home now sits on the site of 'Mornington House', Coney Hall, latterly the principal residence in the area and owned by the Brabazon family. A plaque dedicated to James Brabazon, Esq., who died in 1794, which shows his links to the Earls of Meath, is found on the ivy-covered wall of the early church in the old graveyard of Mornington. The family's association went back to their seventeenth-century ancestor, a Captain James Brabazon who was wounded at the Battle of Aughrim on the Williamite side. Another significant family in the area were the Weslies, later Earls of Mornington. Title of \\"Earl of Mornington\\" The title Earl of Mornington has been one of the greatest British aristocratic titles for centuries. Originally a British peerage title it is now a courtesy title. The current holder of the earldom is Arthur Darcy Wellesley (born 2010), the son of Arthur Gerald Wellesley, Marquess of Douro, and his wife Jemma, née Kidd, who is the sister of Jodie Kidd. The connection to Mornington of the Wellesley, Wesley, Weslie, or, Weisle family name goes back to at least the sixteenth century, as Lewis says on the suppression of Colp Abbey a place called 'Weisle's Farm' in Mornington was paying tithes to the Abbey. Gerald Weslie, late of Dangan, \\"Irish Papist\\", who died in 1603, is mentioned in an inquisition of 1624 as having been in possession of \\"the manor of Marinerstown or Mornanton counting two messages and 120A and of a capital fishery commonly called the lord's fishery\\".D'Alton, John. The History of Drogheda with its environs Vol 2. p450. (Dublin, 1844) Richard Colley (later Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington) inherited Dangan and Mornington in 1728 from his cousin Garret Wesley. His son was the 1st Earl of Mornington, the father of Field-Marshal The 1st Duke of Wellington. Use of the name Mornington in other contexts The many Mornington places in Australia and across the world were named in honour of the second Earl, a brother of the Duke of Wellington. This has led to its use for the Mornington Crescent game on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue taken from the Camden street Mornington Crescent, London also named for the second Earl.

The first to be established was the Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College (RIMC) in March 1922 at Doon Valley which was then in Punjab Province (now the Indian state of Uttarkhand) following the severe difficulties in acceptance and adjustment faced by the first batch of South Asian cadets sent directly to Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England. RIMC was lost with the partition of the country and the army in August 1947 and became the Indian Republic's Rashtriya Indian Military College. The first cadet college to be built by the newly established Pakistan Army was the Punjab Cadet College Hasanabdal, Attock District in Punjab in 1954. Faujdarhat Cadet College was built in Chittagong, then East Pakistan in 1958. In 1922 the British Indian Army also established the King George Royal Indian Military Schools (KGRIMS) at Jhelum and Jalandhar cantonments in Punjab Province for the separate purpose of providing education to the sons of the enlisted men and Other Ranks of the Army. Schools opened between 1925-1930 at Jhelum, Jullundhar and Ajmer.

Its people were descended from the Iron Age tribe of the Silures, and frequently in union with Gwent, merging to form Morgannwg. Name and Early History Glywysing is said to be named after Glywys, a real or legendary early monarch, whose name may continue that of the Romano-British *Glevenses, the territory and citizens of Glevum (modern Gloucester).Koch, John T. Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia ABC-CLIO Ltd (15 Mar 2006) p.1312 According to 12th-century sources, after the death of Glywys, the kingdom was divided into seven cantrefs named for his sons:Carver, Martin The cross goes north: processes of conversion in northern Europe, AD 300-1300 Boydell Press; New edition (26 Jan 2006) p.125 Cydweli, Gwyr, Margam, Penychen, Gwynllwg, Gorfynydd, and another. These were typically ruled together by the head of the family and sometimes treated as appenage subkingdoms. Location The borders changed over time, but it is generally thought that its lands originally lay between the Afon Llwyd and the River Towy. At times they expanded eastwards in union with both Gwent and Ergyng. Some time before the early 8th century, Cydweli and Gwyr (Gower) were lost to Dyfed, although the Gower had returned to Glywysing by 928 prior to the reign of King Morgan the Old.Ashley, Mike (1998) The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens (Carol & Graf) Today the area of Glywysing is known as Glamorgan. Morgannwg First under King Morgan the Generous (fl. ) until the end of the reign of his descendant Ithel (d. c. 745), and later again under King Morgan the Old (r. 942-74), the kingdom merged with Gwent and changed its name to Morgannwg or Gwlad Morgan in honour of the Morgan Kings.Lloyd, John E. A History of Wales from the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest, Vol. 1, p. 274. Longmans, Green, & Co. (London), 1911. Accessed 22 Feb 2013. During such unions Glywysing and Gwent seem to have been together or occasional sub- kingdoms or principalities of the Kingdom of Morgannwg. After the death of Morgan the Old, Gwent and Glywysing were separated again from 974 to 1055, but Glywysing alone was often referred to as Morgannwg. Both areas were conquered by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in about 1055, subsequently King of Wales, but on Gruffydd's death in 1063, Glywysing was regained by the native lineage under Caradog ap Gruffudd. Morgannwg, the union between Gwent and Glywysing, was reconstituted. How this occurred is unclear; possibly the Kings of Glywysing were also Kings of Morgannwg and the Kings of Gwent were semi-independent under-Kings, or vice versa. =Norman conquest= With Gwent increasingly overrun by the Norman conquest of Wales, the last native King of Morgannwyg & Glywysing was Iestyn ap Gwrgan (1081-1090), who was subsequently deposed by Robert Fitzhamon. Iestyn's sons became Lords of Afan, while Owain ap Caradog ap Gruffudd contented himself with Gwynllwg and founded the line of the Lords of Caerleon.

The general partner is the financial entity used to control and manage the fund, while the limited partners are the individual investors who receive their return as capital interest. Private equity funds and hedge funds are private investment vehicles used to pool investment capital, usually for a small group of large institutional or wealthy individual investors. They are subject to favorable regulatory treatment in most jurisdictions from which they are managed, which allows them to engage in financial activities that are off-limits for more regulated companies. Both types of fund also take advantage of generally applicable rules in their jurisdictions to minimize the tax burden on their investors, as well as on the fund managers. As media coverage increases regarding the growing influence of hedge funds and private equity, these tax rules are increasingly under scrutiny by legislative bodies.Michael S. Knoll, Article: The Taxation of Private Equity Carried Interests: Estimating the Revenue Effects of taxing Profit Interests as Ordinary Income, 50 WM. & MARY L. REV. 115, 117 (2008). Private equity and hedge funds choose their structure depending on the individual circumstances of the investors the fund is designed to attract. Basic structure: U.S. domestic fund A private equity or hedge fund located in the United States will typically be structured as a limited partnership, due to the lack of an entity-level tax on partnerships and other flow-through entities under the U.S. tax system.See generally, subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, Title 26 of the U.S. Code. The limited partners will be the institutional and individual investors. The general partner will be an affiliate of the manager of the fund. Typically, the manager of the hedge fund is compensated with a fee based on 2% of the gross assets of the fund, and a profits interest entitling the manager (or, more typically, its affiliated general partner) to 20% of the fund's return (subject, in many cases, to minimum guaranteed returns for the limited partners). Carried interest Because the manager is compensated with a profits interest in the fund, the bulk of its income from the fund is taxed, not as compensation for services, but as a return on investment. Typically, when a partner receives a profits interest (commonly referred to as a \\"carried interest\\"), the partner is not taxed upon receipt, due to the difficulty of ascertaining the present value of an interest in future profits.See, e.g., Campbell v. United States (8th Cir. 1981). This approach was adopted as a general administrative rule by the IRS in a notice in 1993, and again in proposed regulations in 2005. Instead, the partner is taxed as the partnership earns income. In the case of a hedge fund, this means that the partner defers taxation on the income that the hedge fund earns, which is typically ordinary income (or possibly short-term capital gains), due to the nature of the investments most hedge funds make. Private equity funds, however, typically invest on a longer horizon, with the result that income earned by the funds is long-term capital gain, taxable to individuals at a maximum 20% rate. Because the 20% profits share typically is the bulk of the manager’s compensation, and because this compensation can reach, in the case of the most successful funds, enormous figures, concern has been raised, both in Congress and in the media, that managers are taking advantage of tax loopholes to receive what is effectively a salary without paying the ordinary 39.6% marginal income tax rates that an average person would have to pay on such income. To address this concern, Congressman Sander M. Levin introduced , which would eliminate the ability of persons performing investment adviser or similar services to partnerships to receive capital gains tax treatment on their income. However, the Treasury Department has suggested, both in testimony before the Senate Finance CommitteeMicrosoft Word - 07.11.07 TESTIMONY Solomon on Carried Interest.doc and in public speaking engagements, that altering the tax treatment of a single industry raises tax policy concerns, and that changing the way partnerships in general are taxed is something that should only be done after careful consideration of the potential impact. Congressman Charles B. Rangel included a revised version of H.R. 2834 as part of the \\"Mother of All Tax Reform\\" and the 2007 House extenders package. A line item on taxing carried interest at ordinary income rates was included in the Obama Administration's 2008 Budget Blueprint. On April 2, 2009, Congressman Levin introduced a new and substantially revised version of the carried interest legislation as . On May 28, 2010, the House approved carried interest legislation as part of amendments to the Senate-passed version of . On February 14, 2012, Congressman Levin introduced . Publicly traded partnerships In mid-2007, the Blackstone group, a major private equity fund, went public. Ordinarily, a publicly traded partnership is taxed as a corporation.26 U.S.C. 7704(a) (2007) There is, however, an exception for publicly traded partnerships earning only “passive-type” income, such as interest and dividends.26 U.S.C. 7704(c) (2007) Although the investments made by a private equity fund are actively managed, Blackstone took the position that the investments they engaged in fell squarely within literal language of this exception to the usual treatment for publicly traded partnerships. To address what they viewed as a loophole in the law, Senators Baucus and Grassley introduced S. 1624, which would remove the ability for publicly traded partnerships performing asset-management and related services to avoid being taxed as corporations. The result of this bill would be to change the tax treatment of private equity and hedge funds from a single level of taxation at a 15% rate (or 35% in the case of most hedge funds) to a corporate-level tax of 35%, plus a 15% tax on dividends when distributed. While acknowledging that there are concerns with the current treatment of publicly traded partnerships, Treasury Secretary Paulson has declined to endorse the treatment that would be provided under S. 1624. The House extenders package included a carried interest provision that would apply to publicly traded partnerships beginning in tax years after 31 December 2009. Various private equity and hedge fund managers followed Fortress, the first fund manager to go public as a PTP. The funds include Oaktree, Blackstone Group, Och-Ziff, KKR, Apollo Global Management, and Carlyle Group. \\"Blocker\\" corporations Although a partnership structure is advantageous for most investors due to the elimination of an entity-level tax, it is not the desired form for all investors. In particular, foreign investors and domestic tax- exempt organizations both have reasons to prefer to interpose a corporation in the private equity or hedge fund structure. Foreign investors are generally not required to file tax returns unless they have “effectively connected income,” derived from the active conduct of a U.S. trade or business.26 U.S.C. 871 & 881 (2007) Passive investment in a corporation does not give rise to a U.S. trade or business. However, active investment management of the type performed by private equity funds or hedge funds typically does.26 U.S.C. 864 (2007) and regulations thereunder Because partners in a partnership are treated as engaged in whatever business the partnership itself is engaged in, this means that if a foreign investor invests in a hedge fund or private equity fund, it will generally be forced to file a U.S. tax return. To avoid this requirement, a foreign investor will often invest through a blocker corporation (usually located in the Cayman Islands or another offshore jurisdiction). The corporation itself will be required to file U.S. tax returns, and will pay taxes at the normal U.S. corporate tax rate, but the foreign investor will receive only dividends or capital gains from the blocker, and will therefore not be required to file a U.S. return. As an alternative to the “blocker” structure, hedge funds seeking to attract foreign investors can also structure as partnerships, but simply restrict themselves to activities that are not treated as a U.S. trade or business. For example, U.S. tax law provides that trading in securities for the taxpayer’s own account will not constitute a U.S. trade or business.26 U.S.C. 864(b) (2007) Thus foreign hedge funds formed as corporations do not generally pay corporate income tax.Humphreys T, Man A. (2006). Introduction to US Tax Aspects of Hedge Fund Formation. Morrison & Foerster LLP. Domestic tax-exempt entities face similar concerns when investing in funds structured as partnerships. While tax-exempt on income related to their tax-exempt purpose, tax exempt entities are required to file tax returns and pay income tax on “unrelated business taxable income,” commonly referred to as UBTI. Because the activities of an entity structured as a partnership flow through to its investors, if the partnership receives income that would be UBTI in the hands of the tax-exempt investor, the investor is forced to file an income-tax return and pay unrelated business income tax. To avoid this requirement, tax exempt entities use offshore blocker corporations in much the same way foreign investors do. To date, no bill has been introduced to change this treatment, although concerns over the tax gap have led to increased scrutiny of business structures involving offshore corporations in general. For example, in May 2007, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing about offshore structures used for tax evasion.Finance References Category:Corporate taxation Category:Investment management Category:Private equity Category:Hedge funds ","title":"Taxation of private equity and hedge funds"},{"id":"12252250","text":"Logo Latinitas Sinica Michele Ferrero (born 1967) is a Catholic priest, born in Cuneo, Italy, Salesian of Don Bosco, Professor of Moral Theology and Classics, graduated from Taipei Fu Jen Catholic University.

Records of a market on the site date back to the 13th century. It operates six days a week, Monday to Saturday, and mainly sells fruit and vegetables. History A market may have existed in Croydon as early as the Anglo-Saxon period, but the earliest certain record is from 1236–7, when an isolated account roll refers to stallage fees.Harris 2005, p. 253. A market charter was granted to the town by Robert Kilwardby, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1276; and further charters were granted in 1314 by Archbishop Walter Reynolds, and (probably) in c.1343 by Archbishop John de Stratford.Harris 2005, pp. 253, 256–8. Jean-Baptiste Say's map of Croydon, 1785. The triangular medieval marketplace, bounded by Butcher Row (now Surrey Street) to the west and the High Street to the east, is already largely infilled with buildings. The medieval marketplace, perhaps laid out in 1276, occupied the triangle of land now defined by the High Street, Surrey Street, and Crown Hill. To take advantage of the slope of the ground, it seems that the higher and well-drained east side came to be used for corn-trading, and the lower-lying west side (Butcher Row, now Surrey Street) for trading in livestock, meat, and hides.Harris 2005, p. 266. By the later Middle Ages, however, the open marketplace was becoming infilled with buildings. A building on the east side was bought for use as a market house (mainly for corn- trading) in 1566, and was succeeded by another cornmarket nearby in 1609.Harris 2005, pp. 266–7, 296 (n233). The older market house was probably taken over as a general provisions market, and was rebuilt for that purpose (as the so-called Butter Market) in 1708. It continued to be used until 1874.Harris 2005, p. 296 (n232). The charter of 1276 had authorised a weekly market to be held on Wednesdays; that of 1314 a weekly market on Thursdays (probably superseding the Wednesday market); and that of c.1343 a weekly market on Saturdays. The earliest mention of markets actually being held on Saturday dates from 1595, and market day remained Saturday until the middle of the 19th century. In 1861, however, the cornmarket was moved to Thursday, and was held on that day until corn-trading ended in 1907. A minority of traders, mistrusting the change, continued to hold a rival Saturday cornmarket until 1892. The general provisions market continued to be held officially on Saturdays until 1874, when the Butter Market building closed; and afterwards as an unofficial Saturday street market.Harris 2005, pp. 257–9, 286–7 (n 127). Although much of the old marketplace triangle was built up by the 19th century, a small open space remained in Market Street, immediately behind the Butter Market building, and this became the main focus of street trading. However, in 1893 the entire triangle (by this date known as Middle Row) was comprehensively cleared and redeveloped by Croydon Corporation. This development pushed all street trading activities into Surrey Street. In 1922, the street market was taken over by Croydon Corporation, and relaunched as a 6-day market (Monday to Saturday), which it remains. Saturday continues to be the busiest trading day. In November 1994 the market received a royal visit from H.R.H. Charles, Prince of Wales.Lovett 1995, pp. 91–109. Present day Market stall, 1978 A shop on Surrey Street Surrey Street is located behind the Grants of Croydon entertainment complex. The market stretches the whole length of the road. In 2013 there were 75 stalls in the street, as well as shops including Iceland and KFC. The market is regularly used as a location for television, film and advertising. Since 1997 Croydon Council has run an annual \\"Good Stall Award\\" to encourage stall holders to maintain good trading practices.Croydon Council Markets site  See also  *St George's Walk *North End, Croydon  References  Further reading   External links   *Croydon Council Markets site Category:Streets in the London Borough of Croydon Category:Retail markets in London Category:Shopping in the London Borough of Croydon Category:History of the London Borough of Croydon ","title":"Surrey Street Market"},{"id":"12252309","text":"The Snake King's Child (, Kuon Puos Keng Kang, also known as Snaker and Ghost Wife 2) is a 2001 Cambodian-Thai horror film directed by Fai Sam Ang, based on a Cambodian myth about the half-human daughter of a snake god. It is the first full-length feature film for cinema to be produced in Cambodia since before the Khmer Rouge era. The special effect of the lead character's head being full of writhing snakes was achieved by gluing live snakes to a cap worn by the actress. Plot Neang Nhi (Ampor Tevi), a woman neglected by her abusive husband, Manop, is working in the fields one day when she accidentally loses her hoe in some shrubbery and encounters a giant python. The snake speaks to Nhi, and says he will return her hoe if she agrees to have sex with him. That night, the snake transforms into a man (Tep Rindaro), brings back the hoe, and has sex with Nhi, a union that results in Nhi's pregnancy. Manop eventually finds out that it was the python who impregnated his wife, so he beheads the python and then stabs his wife in the stomach. Nhi is killed by the blow, but dozens of small snakes pour out of her abdomen and into a nearby stream. Manop chases after the baby snakes, killing each one, but slips on a rock and is killed. A surviving baby snake transforms into a human infant, who is then found by a wandering monk. The monk names the baby girl Soraya and raises her. She grows into a beautiful teenage woman (Pich Chanbormey), but has living serpents instead of hair. The monk, however, is able to fashion a magical ring that allows her to keep the snakes at bay and appear to have normal hair. One day, Soraya is bathing at a waterfall when she encounters a young man, Wae-ha (Winai Kraibutr), who has fallen into the pool after a fight with another man over a woman. Wae-ha is nursed back to health and he and Soraya fall in love. Wae-ha then takes Soraya back to his home to meet his family. One of Wae-ha's friends attempts to rape Soraya, during which her ring comes off and the snakes appear in her hair and bite the man, killing him with their venom. It is further revealed that if Soraya's virginity is broken, she will permanently turn into a snake. Cast * Winai Kraibutr as Wae-ha * Pich Chanbormey as Soraya * Tep Rindaro as Snake god * Ampor Tevi as Nhi * Heng Dary * Sam Polida * Chao Channary * Tim Angkeara Origins The Snake King's Child is a popular myth in Cambodia and has been depicted on film many times, one of the most famous being a 1960s version, Pos Keng Kang (Snake Woman) that starred Dy Saveth. In 2000, Cambodian director Fai Sam Ang decided it was time to try to make the first feature-length film for cinema in Cambodia since before the Khmer Rouge era, and he chose the oft-told tale in hopes that it would be a commercial success. The film was made as a co-production with investors from Thailand, and featured Thai leading man Winai Kraibutr, veteran Cambodian soap opera actress Ampor Tevi and 17-year-old debut Cambodian actress Pich Chanbormey. Special effects No digital effects are used in the film, as they could not be afforded by the production. To achieve the effect of Soraya's head full of writhing snakes, live snakes were glued to a cap worn by actress Pich Chanboramey. \\"Sometimes the snakes would leap off her head, and we'd have to chase them around the set,\\" director Fai Sam Ang said in an interview. He also said he had trouble convincing the actress to wear the cap. \\"When she first saw the snakes, she cried and cried,\\" Fai Sam Ang said. \\"But I told her she had to be professional. In the end, it was no problem. The snakes would just give her little kisses on the cheek.\\" For another scene, a 4.5-meter python borrowed from a Buddhist temple was placed on top of actress Ampor Tevi to depict her character's sex scene with the snake king. Release At the time of the film's release, war-ravaged Cambodia did not yet have any commercial cinemas suitable to premiere the film, so it was screened at the French Cultural Center and outdoors in the courtyard of a local television station in Phnom Penh. The film also opened in wide release in Thai cinemas. Due to Winai Kraibutr's presence in the cast, the film was marketed in Hong Kong and other Asian markets as Ghost Wife 2 in an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the 1999 Thai ghost film Nang Nak (Ghost Wife), which Winai had starred in. Sequel In 2006, Fai Sam Ang directed sequel called The Snake King's Grandchild (, Chaos Puos Keng Kang, also Snaker 2 and Snake's love), which continues the story of Wae-ha and Soriya.

The current building was constructed in 1884 and is located at the intersection of Indiana State Road 64 and Indiana State Road 65. It is an example of Romanesque Revival architecture and was the model for Department 56's Original Snow Village Courthouse. Gibson County's Courthouse is of very similar design to the Johnson County Courthouse in Franklin, Indiana. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. History The residence of Judge William Harrington was first used to conduct court business. Work on the first courthouse began on September 1, 1814. The building was constructed of bricks which were made nearby on the public square. It had two floors and measured 33 feet by 40 feet. It was first occupied in June 1815.Stormont 1914, pp. 81–82. The second courthouse was also made of brick and was completed in 1843 at a cost of about $9,000.Stormont 1914, p. 82. The third (and current) courthouse was built on the site of the previous building. The cornerstone was laid on June 17, 1884, accompanied by a Masonic ceremony attended by several thousand people.Stormont 1914, p. 83. The McDonald Brothers of Louisville, Kentucky designed the Romanesque Revival building,Counts and Dilts 1991, p. 58. which was constructed by local contractor Joseph Miller of Washington, Indiana at a cost of $188,661.Stormont 1914, p. 83. Counts and Dilts 1991, p. 58, gives the cost as $118,661. The two-story building has a full basement and is made of red brick trimmed with stone; the interior is trimmed with black walnut and oak, and has mosaic tile floors. The trial of Leslie Irvin (also known as \\"Mad Dog Irvin\\") was conducted here in 1955. In 2006 and 2007, an aesthetic renovation project began. The exterior walls and corner towers as well as the central bell tower were repainted, and a gazebo donated by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana was placed on the courthouse lawn.

Hough first came to prominence as captain of the Waterford team for the 1913 championship. Two years later he made his debut for Limerick and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1929 championship. During that time he won two All-Ireland medals and three Munster medals. In 1918 Hough captained the team to the All-Ireland title. At club level Humphreys played with Monagea, De La Salle and Newcastle West, winning a county championship medals with the latter two teams. Early life Willie Hough was born just outside Newcastlewest, County Limerick in 1892. He was born into a family that had a strong association with Gaelic games. His father, who excelled in both hurling and Gaelic football, was chairman of the West Limerick Board of the Gaelic Athletic Association from 1902 until 1910. Hough was educated locally and later attended the De La Salle College in Waterford where he qualified as a national school teacher. After qualifying as a teacher Hough worked in Baltimore, County Cork. Playing career =Club= Hough played his club hurling with a variety of clubs. During his studies in Waterford he played with the De La Salle club and enjoyed some success. He won back-to-back county titles with the club in 1913 and 1914. After moving to Cork Hough played with the UCC club. When he returned to his own native town he played with Newcastle West and enjoyed more success. He captured county titles with that club in 1917 and 1925. =Inter-county= Hough first came to prominence on the inter- county scene, not with his own native-county but, with Waterford. In 1913 he was handed the captaincy of the inter-county team. Waterford, however, were eliminated from the provincial championship at the first hurdle at the hands of Tipperary. After moving to Cork Hough was invited to join the Cork senior team, however, he declined. In 1915 Hough made his debut with the Limerick inter-county team. Limerick’s hurling fortunes were on the way up at the time. In 1917 Hough lined out in his first Munster final with Tipperary providing the opposition. Tipp were the All-Ireland champions, however, Limerick took the game by the scruff of the neck. At the final whistle both sides had recorded 3-4 and a replay was necessary. Tipp made no mistake in the final and walloped Limerick by 6-4 to 3-1. In 1918 Hough was appointed captain of the Limerick senior hurling team. For the second year in-a-row Limerick reached the Munster final. Clare provided the opposition on that occasion, however, Hough’s side were the better team on the day. The final score of 11-3 to 1-2 tells its own story as Hough collected his first Munster title. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Limerick take on Wexford. The first-half saw Hough’s side go on a goal-scoring spree as Limerick took a half-time lead of 5-4 to 0-2. The goals continued in the second-half as Limerick won the game by 9-5 to 1-3, giving Hough his first All-Ireland medal. Hough's two wing backs were Jack Keane and Jimmy Humphries. This line was called the Hindenburg half back line after the famous WW1 German general. In 1919 Limerick reached their third consecutive Munster final. Cork were the opponents on that occasion, however, the All-Ireland champions were humbled with a 3-5 to 1-6 defeat. Hough’s side were heavily beaten by Cork again in the 1920 provincial decider. In 1921 the Munster championship was affected by political strife. Because of this only Cork and Limerick participated with both sides contesting the provincial final for the third consecutive year. Hough’s side avenged the defeats of the previous two years by beating Cork by 5-2 to 1-2. It was Hough’s second Munster title. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Limerick against Dublin. Once again, Limerick went on a goal-scoring rampage with captain Bob McConkey capturing four goals in all. Limerick went on to win the game by 8-5 to 3-2, giving Hough a second All-Ireland medal. Limerick surrendered their Munster crown to Tipperary after a replay in 1922, however, they reversed that defeat in 1923 with Hough adding a third Munster medal to his collection. He later lined out in his third All-Ireland final as Galway provided the opposition. In spite of Galway playing in the very first All-Ireland final they had yet to win a title. Limerick looked likely to capture a third All- Ireland title in six years, however, for the very first time the All-Ireland title went to a team from Connacht. The next few years saw Limerick go into decline in Munster. Hough retired from inter-county activity in 1926. He returned three years later in 1929 for a championship match against Waterford. His side was defeated on that occasion bringing the final curtain down on his inter-county career. Post-playing career In retirement Hough took up refereeing and distinguished himself in National Hurling League and Munster championship games. The highlight of his refereeing career came when he took charge of an All-Ireland semi-final between Kilkenny and Galway. Hough also excelled as an administrator within the GAA. He was vice-chairman of the West Limerick Board from 1924 until 1928. In 1936 he was appointed treasurer of the Munster Council. He remained in that position, unopposed, until his retirement in 1962.

Six days later the ship stood out of Norfolk with Task Group (TG) 21.11, a \\"hunter-killer\\" antisubmarine group composed of , a destroyer, and three other escorts of Escort Division (CortDiv) 51. The task group hunted along the Atlantic sea lanes for German U-boats. On 13 March, aircraft from Bogue in conjunction with , and developed and attacked a promising submarine contact. At 1839 hours, the submarine surfaced in full view of the entire task group. It was immediately fired on by the attacking ships and planes from the carrier. At 1844 hours, the slid under the water, stern first. Twenty-three survivors were picked up by Hobson and Haverfield. During the action, Swenning maintained her station in the escort screen. The task group refueled and provisioned at Casablanca from 18 to 22 March and continued their offensive patrol. The group replenished at Trinidad on 12 April and sailed to Norfolk where the escorts were detached to proceed to New York for yard availability. Swenning remained at New York from 20 April to 3 May when she returned to Hampton Roads to rejoin the Bogue group, now designated as task group TG 22.2. The ships sortied on 5 May on antisubmarine patrol. They called at Casablanca again to replenish from 29 May to 4 June and put to sea. On 8 June, Swenning rescued eight members of the RAF whose Halifax bomber had been ditched in the ocean. The task group arrived at Bermuda on 30 June and departed the next day for Norfolk where it was dissolved. The escorts continued to New York, and Swenning was given an overhaul. She returned to Norfolk on 22 July to rejoin the Bogue group (TG 22.3) which sortied three days later. After a short training period at Bermuda, the group began offensive patrols in the North Atlantic, mainly off the Grand Banks area of Newfoundland. On 19 August, Bogue aircraft attacked a surfaced submarine. Damage was not ascertained as the submarine submerged. The following day another was attacked on the surface. It also submerged; but, approximately two and one-half hours later, it surfaced; the crew abandoned it; and the submarine sank shortly thereafter. The ships replenished at Argentia on 24 August and resumed operations until 24 September when the group was dissolved at New York. After a yard period and refresher training in the New London, Connecticut, area, Swenning sailed to Norfolk. Swenning participated in antisubmarine training off Bermuda with Bogue and CortDiv 51 from 23 October to 21 November and from 26 December 1944 to 16 January 1945. The escort spent February conducting antisubmarine and gunnery exercises at Casco Bay and March training submarines at New London. She began her last Atlantic war patrol on 16 April when CortDiv 51 joined Bogue to form TG 22.3 at Melville, Rhode Island. Until the end of hostilities with Germany, the group was a unit of a north-south submarine barrier patrol as part of Operation Teardrop. The barrier consisted of 24 ships of TG's 22.3, 22.4, 22.8 and Task Unit 22.7.1. Swenning had no significant role in the ensuing action, but the barrier patrols sank five submarines at the expense of one destroyer escort sunk by a torpedo. On 8 May, news of Germany's capitulation reached TG 22.3 which proceeded to New York the next day. The ships arrived there on 11 May, and the task group was dissolved. Swenning steamed to Boston, Massachusetts, and entered the navy yard for an overhaul in preparation for duty in the Pacific. While there, her torpedo tubes were removed and replaced by twin 40 millimeter antiaircraft guns. =Pacific War= Swenning stood out of Boston, with CortDiv 51, on 30 June en route to the Pacific war zone. A two-week training period was held at Guantánamo Bay before transiting the Panama Canal on 21 July. The division arrived at San Diego, California, on 30 July and stood out for Hawaii two days later. Swenning was at Pearl Harbor from 7 to 20 August when she steamed to Saipan, via Eniwetok, Marshall Islands. She arrived at Saipan on 30 August and made a round-trip voyage to Okinawa from 5 to 13 September 1945. The DE moved to Guam the following week and assisted in training submarines of the U.S. Pacific Fleet out of that port until 10 January 1946. Swenning departed Guam on that date for the east coast of the United States via Pearl Harbor, She arrived at San Diego on 28 January and proceeded on to Boston, via Panama, and arrived there on 26 February. It was determined that Swenning would be inactivated, and she sailed down the coast to Mayport, Florida, arriving there on 12 April. =Decommissioning and fate= She was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 18 June 1946. In September the escort was towed to Charleston, South Carolina, for yard availability which lasted until December 1946 when she was towed to Mayport, Florida, and laid up with the Atlantic Reserve Fleet on the St. Johns River at Green Cove Springs, Florida. She was later relocated to the reserve fleet at Orange, Texas following the closure of the Green Cove Springs facility in 1962. Swenning was struck from the Navy list on 1 July 1972 and sold to Northern Metals Co., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for scrap on 17 January 1974.

Different views of the shell of Ancylus fluviatilis Description The 5–8 mm.limpet-like shell has a backwardly directed, conical apex. The shell shape is higher than Acroloxus and Ferrissia.The apex is blunt when seen from above, but appears more pointed from the side. The shell is bent backwards and very weakly to the right side. It is thin and translucent, with reticulate sculpture and fine growth lines. In colour it is light yellowish to reddish brown or dull pale brown. The animal is grey with black dots near the head and almost entirely covered by the shell. The tentacles are triangular with eyes at their base. The genital pore and pneumostome are very small and located at the right side. Distribution The distribution type is (probably since de-limitation of various southern and eastern forms which may be given independent species status is not understood) Eurosiberian Southern-temperate. This species occurs in Europe in the following countries and islands: * The British Isles: Great Britain and Ireland * Czech Republic * Germany * Netherlands * Poland * Slovakia * France * and others see Fauna Europaea. * Not in the North of Norway, southern Sweden, Finland In large parts of the Mediterranean area (Iberian Peninsula, Italy, etc.) occurring there are marked forms which according to molecular genetic are stand-alone forms so far not named their own. Such forms are also found in northeastern Africa (coastal areas of Morocco to Tunisia, Hoggar mountains in Algeria), as well as in the Highlands up to 2240 m above sea level in Ethiopia.Hubendick, B.: Studies on Ancylidae, the Palearctic and Oriental species and formgroups. In: Acta Zool. 5: 5-52 (1970)David S. Brown: Fresh Water Snails of Africa and their Medical Importance. 2nd ed., Taylor & Francis 1994. It found in Saudi Arabia (Brown and Wright 1980, Neubert 1998) and Yemen (Al-Safadi 1990 and from Caucasus, Armenia, but it is not known from the Afrotropical region.  Habitat  This freshwater limpet is rheophile, which lives in oxygen-rich fast-running waters and also in karst springs. It does not occur in waters which freeze in winter. They need a hard substrate with suitable (not too low and not too rich) algae growth, which is why they are frequent in Central Europe especially in rivers and streams. In North America and Western Europe they occur in lakes. In contrast to many other freshwater snails, the animals tolerate a base-poor acidic environment. Southern European, North African and Middle East representative of the species group can survive exposure due to low water levels up to a certain extent by forming a protective layer on the underside of the shell. In Central European forms, this is possible only to a limited extent, but they may survive low water levels by adhering firmly on the stone surface. References  Further reading  * Streit B.

He is portrayed by actor Paul Adelstein.Private Practice at The Futon Critic Character history Cooper Freedman (Coop) was the only child, adopted, raised in Akron, Ohio. He never looked for his biological parents because he feels his parents are great. As a teen, he worked on summer camps in Indiana, where he realized he liked children and decided to become a pediatrician. He always says he wants to be \\"normal\\" in regards to his relationship with Charlotte King. Work Cooper works at the Oceanview Wellness Center as a pediatrician. He is best friends with his coworker, Violet Turner, who is a psychiatrist. They both suffer from relationship troubles; Cooper has problems meeting women because he says that he does not know how to socialize with people, so instead of dating face-to-face, Cooper prefers internet dating. These online relationships almost never work out and he is always left humiliated. For example, in the episode \\"The Other Side of This Life, Part 1\\", Cooper's car is stolen by a woman he met online. Despite his personal problems, Cooper is quite successful at his job. He is a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics. It is clear that he genuinely cares about every one of his patients, as he is easily able to empathize with them and is willing to go the extra mile to help them. For example, in one episode, he noticed several symptoms of abuse in a girl with a broken arm whose mother is Sam's patient. Despite Sam's objections, Cooper reports his suspicions and later testifies in court to help the child. On one occasion, Cooper even confides in a patient named Michael about a love dilemma, that he is in love with a woman, but also couldn't tell her. Cooper and Michael make a pact to tell the objects of their affection how they feel. Personal life In the beginning of season 1 it is suggested that Cooper is in love with Violet Turner, his best friend and a psychiatrist at Oceanside Wellness. Cooper is often ridiculing Violet for her continued infatuation with her ex-boyfriend Alan. When Violet is feeling sexually deprived she makes a pact to be friends with benefits with Cooper, but Cooper backs out at the last minute because he does not want to change their relationship. In the episode \\"In Which Cooper Finds a Port in His Storm,\\" he meets Dr. Charlotte King, chief of staff at the local hospital and someone he knows professionally, through an on-line dating site. She is completely embarrassed by this and walks away from the date, and attempts to avoid Cooper thereafter, but the end of the episode, she agrees to have a drink with Cooper, but instead, the two end up having sex and enter into a strictly sexual relationship in later episodes. The two begin to care for each other; however, the relationship breaks apart after Cooper finds out Charlotte has secretly been making and executing plans to rent out the fourth floor of the practice. In the episode \\"Homeward Bound\\", he goes to Alabama to find her and see her dying father. He assists in pulling the plug and on the ride home she cries in his lap. In \\"Nothing to Fear\\", they reconcile and she asks him to marry her. He initially agrees but later says he wants to spend the rest with her but declines. In 2x14 Charlotte forgives him until he says he's moving in with Violet. In 2x15, he reveals that Violet is pregnant, he is not the father, but he wants to help. He tells her that he loves her but she leaves saying that his first child should be with her. Later Charlotte sleeps with Archer to push Cooper away. When she tells him, however, he refuses to give up on the relationship and pledges his love. Moved, she apologizes, and he says that he forgives her. They start fresh and everything goes well until Violet is attacked by a former patient, Katie. Cooper blames himself for not being there to protect her. In the episode \\"Right Here, Right Now\\", he tells Charlotte that he is broke, and she pays to buy out his share of the practice. In the following episode, Charlotte joins the practice with a specialty in Sexology which makes him uncomfortable. He also feels emasculated, which is a running theme for him in season 3. In 3x07 Charlotte reveals that she was married before which causes tension between them and he breaks up with her later. In 3x16 he comes back from a two-week vacation. She yells at him for abandoning her, and he says that it was a mistake to sleep with her. Later he walks in on her and Sheldon having sex. In 3x19 he works with Charlotte in a sex education session for the elderly. Also, he tells her that he wants to keep a professional relationship with her. In 3x20 Violet returns, and he almost kisses Charlotte. He tells Violet that his parents' had another son who died before him, and that he feels like he was a second choice for Charlotte. He tells Violet he's going to try to get Charlotte back. In 3x21 he testifies for Violet's custody for her and Pete's son Lucas. He admits to the judge that she should not get custody of Lucas. Violet slaps him. At the end, he tells Charlotte that he hasn't been himself and the people he loves are important and asks her out to dinner. In 3x22 they have sex in the beginning but he later brushes her off. At the end of the episode Violet forgives him and he admits to her that he loves Charlotte. So Violet tells him to go after Charlotte. So he does. In the season 3 finale 3x23 He proposes to Charlotte and later tells everyone in the waiting room that he's getting married. At the end, he tells her that he should take back the proposal and do it the next day, because it was a crappy day to propose with the Dell dying and Maya almost dying. When she doubts his motives he tells her, \\"you are everything I never knew I wanted, I cannot live without you.\\" She gives him back the ring and he asks, \\"I propose again tomorrow, what will you say?\\" and she says she's going to say yes. Charlotte and Cooper's relationship hits a bit of a rough patch after she is raped, however they overcome their issues and marry. In season 5, Cooper discovers that he has a son, Mason, and Cooper instantly bonds with his child and after a bit of a rocky start, Charlotte eventually bonds with him as well. In the first episode of season 6 he and Charlotte find out they're pregnant with triplets girls, who they named - Georgia (name given by Charlotte, born 1st), Caroline (name given by Mason, born 2nd) and Rachel King-Freedman (name given by Cooper, born 3rd).

Species There are currently four recognized species in this genus: * Otothyris juquiae Garavello, Britski & Schaefer, 1998 * Otothyris lophophanes (Eigenmann & Eigenmann, 1889) * Otothyris rostrata Garavello, Britski & Schaefer, 1998 * Otothyris travassosi Garavello, Britski & Schaefer, 1998 Distribution The genus Otothyris is distributed along the Atlantic coast of Brazil between Barra do Ribeira, Guaíba River Basin of Rio Grande do Sul State in the south to the Jequitinhonha River Basin of Bahia State in the north. The species are apparently restricted to the lowland sections of these river systems near the coast and have not been collected further to the west in higher elevation or headwater streams. Description Otothyris species have a laterally-placed eye that does not have an iris diverticulum. The head and margin of the snout have enlarged odontodes arranged in dorsal and lateral series. The pectoral skeleton is completely exposed from below and bears strong odontodes. The supraoccipital has paired anterior odontode crests and a posterior midline crest. Immature specimens of Otothyris species, as in most species of the Hypoptopomatinae, exhibit salient crests or ridges of enlarged odontodes on the posterodorsal region of the supraoccipital and pterotic-supracleithrum bones. In O. lophophanes, O. juquiae, and O. rostrata, these odontode crests are retained in adults and the regions of the head between crests form deep depressions with growth. Within Otothyris, O. lophophanes, O. juquiae, and O. rostrata have larger and more extensive odontode crests, more pronounced odontode ridges, larger swimbladder capsule, and larger pterotic fenestrae, in comparison with O. travassosi, which has smaller, shorter odontode crests and less pronounced ridges, a relatively small swimbladder capsule, and smaller pterotic fenestrae. Otothyris lophophanes has a single series of downturned rostral odontodes separated from a series of upturned odontodes along the dorsal rostral margin by a distinct, broad linear discontinuity, which extends laterally to a line through the anterior nares; however, in all other members of the genus, the ventral downturned odontodes comprise more than one series and are not separated from the dorsal odontodes by a broad linear discontinuity. Otothyris species also differ in tooth counts, lateral line and abdominal plates, and morphometrics.

History During the 2003 regular legislative session, the Louisiana Legislature passed Act 9 to create the Recovery School District (RSD) to take over the operations of failing schools, defined as schools that do not meet the minimum academic standards for at least four consecutive years. The legislation was signed into law in May of that year by Governor of Louisiana Kathleen Blanco. Pierre Capdau School in New Orleans became the state's first takeover school in 2004, and subsequently became Louisiana's first RSD charter school, known as a Type 5 charter school. In August 2004, the school opened as Pierre Capdau-UNO Charter School under the management of the New Beginnings Foundation and the University of New Orleans. In the spring of 2005, four additional New Orleans schools were taken over by the state, and turned over to charter school operators: Medard Nelson, Samuel Green, Phillips, and Sophie B. Wright. Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans on August 29, 2005, bringing near total devastation to the city and damaging or destroying more than 100 of the city's 128 school buildings. In the face of uncertainties about the future of schools in the city, the Louisiana Legislature acted by passing Act 35. Eventually, the Recovery School District (RSD) took over 102 out of 126 schools from the Orleans Parish School Board (OPSB) in late-November 2005. Of the remaining 24 schools, seven were uninhabitable, 12 became charters, and five remained directly managed by OPSB. RSD school data = Achievement, 2014–15 = * RSD schools outpace the state with a 29 percentage point increase from 2008-2014 in the percent of students performing at basic and above, compared to a 9 percentage point increase across the state. * In 4th and 8th grade (retention grades), proficiency citywide has more than doubled in both English language arts and math. * More students are prepared for college and career with 39% of RSD 12th graders scoring 18+ on ACT in 2011 to 49% of students in 2014. = Demographics, 2014–15 = Though enrollment has been steadily increasing, student enrollment in New Orleans is still only about 70% of pre-katrina levels. * RSD serves 90% economically disadvantaged students; * RSD serves over 11% special education students; and * RSD serves just over 95% African American students. = New Orleans school governance, 2015–16 = * The Recovery School District governed 52 charter schools, under the direction of Superintendent Patrick Dobard.

Trimusculidae, the button snails, is the only family in the superfamily Trimusculoidea, a superfamily of false limpets. These are marine pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the clade Eupulmonata. Trimusculids are not very closely related to the siphonariids, another family of marine air-breathing false- limpets. The trimusculids are in the clade Eupulmonata, and are quite closely related to air-breathing land snails. Description Trimusculids are sometimes known as \\"button shells\\" or \\"button snails\\" because, especially in the eastern Pacific species Trimusculus reticulatus, the shells are small, white, almost perfectly circular in outline, only moderately elevated, and thus the shells are somewhat reminiscent of traditional white shirt buttons.

On September 19, 1864, a detachment of the regiment along with soldiers from the 3rd Missouri State Militia Cavalry Regiment (Union) under the command of First Lieutenant Erich Pape, captured the town of Doniphan, Missouri, and burned most of it, including the court house, to the ground. This was allegedly done in retaliation for pro-Confederate guerrilla activity in Ripley County. The Union horse soldiers then retreated, burning farm houses and barns as they went.

He was the elder brother of fellow boxer Herbert \\"Baby\\" Stribling.  Background  Born in Bainbridge, Georgia, on December 26, 1904, Young Stribling spent most of his childhood in show business with his parents and a younger brother. His parents were devout Christians from rural southwest Georgia. In 1911, Stribling's family had come to Spokane on the Sullivan and Considine Vaudeville Circuit with an acrobatic act called the \\"Four Novelty Grahams.\\" Ma was his trainer, donning gloves and sparring with him in the ring. Pa was his manager and promoter. The Stribling family traveled widely as vaudeville performers with a wholesome family act that included gymnastics and balancing acts and ended with a brief boxing match between four-year-old \\"Strib\\" and his two-year-old brother, \\"Baby\\" Stribling. The act lasted several years and was so popular that it took the family through 38 foreign countries before they settled in Macon, Georgia, prior to World War I. Backstage between acts, the Striblings read the Bible together and prayed before each performance, just as \\"Strib\\" later prayed before each fight when he became a professional boxer. Regardless of where the family performed, they always went to church on Sunday and refused any physical training on the Lord's Day. \\"Strib\\" attended Macon's Lanier High School where he excelled as a forward on the basketball team that won the state championship in 1922. Stribling was one of the best high school basketball players in the United States. He was known as a \\"dead shot\\". His team went to the national interscholastic tournament at Chicago, but he was ruled ineligible to play because of his professional boxing. Stribling was also an avid and accomplished aviator who loved to fly. Stribling was raised as a vegetarian.White, Jaclyn Weldon. (2011). The Greatest Champion that Never Was: The Life of W.L. \\"Young\\" Stribling. Mercer University Press. p. 13.  Professional career  Stribling turned professional in 1921. While still in high school, Stribling fought 75 professional bouts. After gaining favorable media attention for his first major fight, a bout which he tied with champion Mike McTigue from Ireland, \\"Strib\\" was besieged by offers to box all over the United States, Europe, South America, and Africa. People wanted to see the young prodigy of the boxing ring in person during those days before television. \\"Strib's\\" most successful year was 1925 when the family purchased a bus and toured coast-to- coast to give fans in smaller towns an opportunity to see a popular boxer in exhibition bouts. Pa sometimes pitted him against the local champion, offering $10.00, a substantive amount at the time, to anyone who could beat his son. \\"Strib\\" fought 33 matches that year. Moreover, the tour did much to popularize the sport, and it helped establish the athlete's reputation for clean sportsmanship and wholesome living. He never drank or smoked, and he was always careful about what went into his body. Another cross-country tour in 1927, this time without the bus, resulted in his winning 57 straight fights with only one draw and one loss. He fought 38 bouts in 1928, winning all but two by a knockout. He ended the tour by knocking out three different opponents within four days in three different cities, no opponent lasting more than two rounds. Macon loved the Stribling family and honored \\"Strib\\" with a parade after every major fight. In turn, \\"Strib\\" established himself as a valuable citizen. As a professional boxer \\"Strib\\" usually trained on the family farm in Ochlocknee, near Thomasville, Georgia. There on November 17, 1927, he was raised a Master Mason at Ochlocknee Lodge No. 117 (now defunct). And back in Macon on December 7, 1928, he became a 32° Scottish Rite Mason. He was created a Shriner of Macon's Al Sihah Temple on May 23, 1929. During the peak of his career, \\"Strib\\" flew his own airplane to fights around the country and served as a lieutenant in the Air Force Reserve, taught Sunday School for athletes at Macon's Mulberry Street Methodist Church, and worshipped at Vineville Baptist Church where he was a member. Incredibly handsome and personally appealing, the six-foot-tall, blue-eyed, brown-haired youth received offers to model clothes for major companies and to appear on the Broadway stage. He received numerous gifts from admirers, including a motorcycle on which he often had a rider, his mother. Big-name fighters had their photos made with him, including heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, who later became one of his best friends. By 1926, \\"Strib's\\" success as a boxer had earned him over a million dollars. And there was more to come. \\"Strib\\" celebrated his 21st birthday by marrying Clara Kinney, a student at Brenau College. Clara's father was a prominent Macon businessman, and her mother was the first woman to serve on the city council. Clara's grandfather was a former president of Wesleyan College in Macon, the oldest female college in America. \\"Strib\\" and Clara had three children. Although he lost his championship bid in the fight against future world champion Jack Sharkey at Miami Beach in 1929, \\"Strib\\" at 23 had fought more professional rounds than any other fighter in history, had knocked out more opponents, and had compiled other records as well. Later in 1929, \\"Strib\\" made his first European tour where he lost by a foul to a future world heavyweight champion Primo Carnera in London and a month later defeated him in Paris in a rematch. Later in 1930, he made a second European tour, and this time defeated the champions of Germany, Great Britain, Italy, and Belgium. Back in the United States while nursing a broken left hand, he defeated the heavyweight champion of Norway. \\"Strib\\" missed his one great chance to become heavyweight champion of the world when he lost to Max Schmeling on July 3, 1931, in Cleveland, on a technical knockout in the last 14 seconds of the 15th round. The battle was a rout before it was half over; the only round Young Stribling might've won was the 4th. According to one ringside observer, Stuart Bell, \\"Strib\\" might've landed only 30 good punches in the 15 round fight. It was the first major fight to be broadcast live over national radio. When the fight ended, \\"Strib\\" went to shake hands with Schmeling who, although swarmed by photographers, insisted on being photographed with \\"Strib.\\" During the spring of 1932, \\"Strib\\" went on a boxing tour to Australia, accompanied by his wife and children, and in the fall they sailed to Johannesburg, South Africa, where he defeated the heavyweight champion of that country before a record crowd of 15,000. Early in 1933 \\"Strib\\" returned to Paris to beat, again, the champion of Belgium in a rematch. One night in Atlanta, \\"Strib\\" rose from his ringside seat and threw in the towel to stop a young boxer's brutal beating by an experienced opponent. The news reporter who witnessed the incident later wrote, \\"To me, this one incident did more to reveal the true character and instinct of Young Stribling than anything else—the instinct of a Christian gentleman who abhorred brutality whether at his expense or the expense of a foe.\\" =Highlights= \\"Strib\\" fought a total of 253 recorded bouts, losing only 13. He was knocked out only once, and it was a technical KO during the final round with Germany's Max Schmeling in 1931. His lifetime achievement records include most fights by a heavyweight, most fights by a heavyweight in a single year (he fought 55), most knockouts by a heavyweight (129), and fewest times knocked out. Champion boxer Jim Corbett called him \\"the best heavyweight fighter for his pounds that ever lived.\\" Setting himself at odds with boxing promoters of the 1920s, \\"Strib\\" decried the violence and cruelty associated with professional boxing, and he saw himself as a \\"scientific\\" pugilist who preferred to win over his opponent on points rather than knockouts. He gained attention from the media as an outstanding boxer beginning with his first professional fight at age 16 in Atlanta.  Death  He died on October 3, 1933, after a motorcycle/automobile accident when he was just 28. The accident occurred October 1 outside of Macon, Georgia. Traveling 35 miles per hour on a motorcycle, \\"Strib\\" was en route to a hospital to visit his convalescing wife and their newborn baby (his third child), born two weeks previously. He waved a greeting to a friend passing in an automobile. But he failed to see another car behind that of his friend, Roy Barrow. The veteran of roughly 300 bouts, who never received a permanent scar due to his great defensive skills, attempted to dodge the second car but was too late. The fender of the car struck Stribling, crushing and virtually ripping off his left foot, and sending him to the pavement, fracturing his pelvis. Stribling was taken to the hospital, where, coincidentally, his wife and baby were. His mother rushed to the hospital from the Stribling plantation in South Georgia; his father from Texas. At one point he awoke, saw his wife, and asked, \\"How's the baby?\\" Almost to the end he remained conscious, \\"carrying on in the same spirit that he showed when they picked him up from the roadside on Sunday,\\" reported papers of the day. \\"Well, kid,\\" he said to his friend (Barrow), who was the first to reach him as he lay beside his wrecked motorcycle with one foot dangling by a single tendon, \\"I guess this means NO more roadwork.\\" At first the doctors held out hope, after they had amputated his left foot. But his vitality began to wane. Physicians were amazed at his ability to cling to life when his temperature hit 107.5 degrees and his pulse 175bpm. His wife was wheeled into his room and he recognized her. \\"W.L.?\\" \\"Sugar,\\" was his barely audible reply. \\"Hello, baby,\\" were his last words to her, the papers reported. His father walked grimly from the room and tearfully said, \\"He's gone.\\" Death occurred at 6:00 Tuesday morning, October 3. The next day, his body was placed in the Municipal Auditorium of Macon, to lie in state from 10 in the morning until 6 that evening. He was buried in Riverside Cemetery  Honors  * Inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1965. * Stribling's fight against Schmeling was named Ring Magazine fight of the year in 1931. * Inducted into the International Boxing Hall Of Fame in 1996.http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/oldtimer/stribling.html  Footnotes   References  * Excerpts taken from the Nov. 7, 1927 Spokane Spokesman Review newspaper, just prior to Stribling's visit to nearby Dishman, WA. * White, Jaclyn Weldon. 2011.

It was not until 1852 that the first Public Library was opened in Great Britain. Previous to this time there had been Mechanics Institutes dating from 1823. Eventually they spread to Canada and in 1835 the Legislature of Upper Canada made a special Act to grant money to these Institutes. It was on 19 August 1887 that a public meeting was called for the purpose of forming a Mechanics Institute in Port Carling. The meeting was held in the Victoria Hall, a building on the main street owned by Mrs. Wm. Hanna, and ten gentlemen of the village attended. Officers were elected, directors were appointed, and Mr. George Sutton was made the first Librarian. The first books received by the Mechanics Institute were donated by Mr. Charles Blachford of Toronto. Another Toronto visitor, a Mr. Harvey, subscribed for the first daily paper, 'The Toronto Mail'. The first magazines subscribed for were: Judge, Grip, Century and Illustrated London News. A few of the first books were: 'Pre-Historic Man', 'Evidence to Man's Place in Nature', 'The Dawn of History', 'The Story of Creation', and others of a similar nature. The membership fee was one dollar a year, and fifty cents additional for each member of a family using books. For years Mr. Fraser covered all the books with cloth before they were put in circulation. The history of the Library is really the history of the Community. In 1890 the Mechanics Institute was instrumental in starting a Night School for the benefit of those who were unable to attend day classes. Miss Stewart conducted these classes. In 1891 Mr. Sutton resigned as Librarian and Mr. William Bailey was appointed to take the position. He held this office for five years and was succeeded by Mr. Fred Hanna who served for ten years. At this time the salary was thirty dollars a year. To help pass the time profitably during the long winter months the Board arranged for lecturers to come twice a month. In May 1895 the name was changed from Mechanics Institute to Port Carling Public Library, and in accordance with government regulations. one hundred members had to be secured. The fee was lowered to thirty cents for adults and twenty cents for children. For a few years there seemed to be difficulty in keeping a Librarian. Messrs. Stephen Cope, Rod Wallis, and John Cope held the position about a year each. At this time, the library was having financial troubles. Concerts were quite frequently given to raise funds with the Debating Society usually setting up the program. Mr. F. D. Stubbs succeeded Mr. Penson, and agreed to combine the offices of librarian, secretary and treasurer for $55 a year. In 1905 the new Town Hall was built and the Library was moved to a room at the back of it which also served as a dressing room and sometimes a kitchen when concerts and plays were put on—much to the disgust of the Librarian! In this same year (1905) the Library was taken over by the municipality thus putting it on the tax roll where it has remained ever since. It was now in a position of an assured income, the Act setting apart the amount it was entitled to draw from the tax payers, namely, one mill. On February 8, 1918, something heretofore unheard of happened when a woman, (Mrs. John Matheson) was appointed a member of the Library Board! For a short time Mrs. Arthur Nott took over the duties of Librarian when Mr. Stubbs withdrew due to illness. Next came Mr. Fred Andrew who was appointed and held the office until his death in 1934. Although handicapped by deafness Mr. Andrew carried on faithfully for sixteen years. Mr. Orlando Stubbs succeeded Mr. Andrew and carried on with the help of his sisters until 1940 when he moved to British Columbia. During his term, the new Dewey System of cataloguing was started and membership cards were reduced to ten cents. Mrs. John (Leila) Cope, was appointed librarian in October 1940 and held the office until 1959. In May 1951 upon the completion of the new Port Carling Memorial Community Centre, the Library was moved to the room at the front of the building and the membership doubled. The library remained in this location with a variety of librarians. Whereas the initial group of librarians were men, the remainder of the librarians have been women. Betty Amey, Kitty Tassie, Joan Young, and Elizabeth Glen have held the position in turn. Mrs. Glen started in 1980 and continues to be not only the head librarian, but the CEO of the library in Port Carling as well as the branch libraries in the Township of Muskoka Lakes. =New Era= A 49-year-old history came to an end on Saturday, August 19, 2000 when the last book was borrowed and stamped and the doors of the Library housed in the Port Carling Memorial Centre closed for the last time. The Township of Muskoka lakes had agreed to provide the funds to erect a new Library building. However, the fundraising for the outfitting of the interior was the responsibility of the Library Board, and with the help of the community and the Friends of the Muskoka Lakes Library group, the fundraising goals were met. However, along the way, as construction costs went over budget, certain elements of the original design had to be cut from the plans. It was at this time that a generous financial contribution from Graham and Kara Alloway, in honour of Graham's parents Norma and Miller Alloway, made it possible to re-include the axed elements. The funds contributed by the Alloway family furnished, decorated, landscaped, automated, and signed the new library. The Alloway gift also contributed to the aesthetics of the building, such as the tower and the slate shingles which had been removed from the original plans due to lack of funds. During demolition of the old and construction of the new, the Library was housed in the building directly opposite (now Grandma Penney's). There it remained until the new building was ready for operation. It was a proud day for the Township, the Library Board, and the community of Port Carling when on Saturday, August 18, 2001 the ribbon was cut for the official grand opening of the new Norma and Miller Alloway Muskoka Lakes Library, named to honour and recognize the generous donation made by the Alloway family. Many dignitaries of the day were in attendance including Mayor Susan Pryke MP Andy Mitchell, MPP Norm Miller, along with the Alloway Family. The library continued in the old ways of ink and stamp pad for check out and hardcopy card catalogue until the launching of the automated system on December 1, 2004. After many, many months of inputting book and patron data the staff was ready to put away the stamps and stamp pads and move into the era of automation and patrons were issued with plastic credit-card- sized library cards that are in use today. Alloway Family Miller Alloway began a lifelong involvement with printing and publishing while working at the Oshawa Times, which was owned by his father. He then went on to build a name for himself in the world of printing, publishing and graphic arts throughout North America. Norma Alloway was an author, as well as a contributor to many newspapers and magazines. She was also a member of the antique and Classic Boat Society, the Muskoka Lakes Golf and Country Club and a board member of the Port Carling Pioneer Museum. Both Norma and Miller dedicated much of their time and energy to numerous Christian causes. They also felt very passionately about education and learning. “It is in recognition of my parents' Christian philanthropic heritage that we have gladly contributed to the funding of the library”, said son Graham Alloway. Bala Library's History Information is scarce as to when the first library started in Bala. It is known that many of the early settlers brought a collection of books with them. E.B. Sutton brought his own personal library to Bala when he emigrated in 1882. Apart from building the Bala Bay Inn in 1912, he was a prolific writer and historian until his death in 1917. Thomas Burgess who started the first school, the first church, the first general store and a sawmill, no doubt contributed to the literacy in the community of which he was afounder. It is known that the Women's Institute did tremendous work in the community and shared their books with anyone interested. Initially the books were kept in private homes, particularly in the home of the Gowland family which is where Tom Edwards Real Estate is today. In those early days great credit must be given to Edna Templeton and Ruth Stainer Orchard for their endless work and enthusiasm in establishing a small library in the Bala Public School under the direction of Jess Johnston. This is home to the Bala Legion today. Through the 1950s the library flourished until the school moved to Glen Orchard. Once again the Women's Institute were responsible for finding space in the United Church building. Finally the library moved to the Community Center on Maple Street in 1970 and continued to be well supported by the Women's Institute. The space was very limited however and far from ideal. In 1994 an addition was built to the Community Center and this is where the library stands today with Mrs. Mari Carson as librarian. This branch has a wonderful selection of current adult fiction, a large children's selection, and an internet connected computer with internet access and scanner available for public use. Our selection of books continues to grow as we receive support from the community and an annual generous financial donation from the Cranberry Festival.  Milford Bay Library's History  The Milford Bay Public Library opened up in 1972 in the original Community Centre location which was also the Council Chambers as the village of Milford Bay had not yet been amalgamated with Port Carling and the surrounding villages to form the Township of Muskoka Lakes. This library was set up as a branch of the Township of Muskoka Lakes Public Library System and continues as such today. The humble beginnings started with books donated from the residents of Milford Bay, and the Port Carling branch library donated books and some shelving and approximately $100.00 cash. Neil Donald, a resident of the community, volunteered his time to build the remaining shelving and was assisted by Don Goltz. The Port Carling Library hired Jan Reeves to be the Milford Bay Librarian and Pat Williams generously volunteered her time until 1979 when Jan Reeves retired. Pat then took over the post. It was that year, 1979, when the new Milford Bay Community Centre was completed, built entirely with volunteer labour. The library was moved to this site where it continues to reside today. (The old Community Centre became the existing Fire Hall.) In 1993 Nancy Kirkpatrick took over the reins from Pat, and in November 2000 Wendy McHugh became Milford Bay's librarian. Today the library has Cynthia Michaud as the librarian. This branch has a wonderful selection of current adult fiction, a large children's selection, and an internet-connected computer with internet access and scanner available for public use. Walker's Point Library's History Walker's Point and Barlochan is a peninsula of 3,000 acres (12 km²) thinly connected to the mainland on the West Shore of Lake Muskoka. The southern half of the peninsula was Walker's Point after the original property owner, the northern half is Barlochan, Gaelic for \\"By The Lake\\". It was sometimes called Long Point and was used by First Nations peoples until 1868. Under the Free Grant & Homestead Act of 1868 the first settlers arrived in 1869 to develop agriculture. The only connection was by lake in summer and horse and foot in winter. Due to the poor terrain they went into logging. With the influx of tourists from the south they then turned to the tourist trade. In the years of waiting for electricity people read papers and books by the light of the oil lamps in the evening. The school had a small library. The Sunday School Library was quite large and was constantly replenished with used books from city libraries. An excellent library of classics, including Shakespeare, Dickens, Scott and many others were lent to those who enjoyed them. A Branch of the Township of Muskoka Lakes Public Library System, the Walker's Point Library was opened September 29 of 1990 and is situated in the Walker's Point Community Centre at the entrance of the peninsula. The library services both residents and tourists with books of varying interests and is well supported by both. This branch has a wonderful selection of current adult fiction, a children's selection, and an internet connected computer with internet access and scanner available for public use. The librarian is currently Mr. Randy Thomson.

The unit was established in 1940 and operated through the duration of World War II. The DSK was nominally charged with overseeing all bank foreign exchange transactions in nations occupied by Nazi Germany, including monitoring bank deposits of currency, financial instruments, and precious metals. Quickly, however, the concept of 'foreign currency transactions' was broadly reinterpreted to mean anything of financial value. In practice, members of the DSK confiscated whatever they thought may be of worth. Actions by the DSK included inspections of individual safe deposit boxes in the presence of the box holder, a bank employee, and a Nazi officer. Banknotes, stocks and bonds, gold and silver bullion, precious stones, and art objects found in the possession of general citizens were inventoried and placed in accounts controlled by German authorities. Jewish assets confiscated under various decrees were transferred to a German registered banking agent or the Vermögensverwaltungs und Rentenanstalt (Property Administrations and Pension Institute). Property issues were handled by Verwalter (special administrators). Lists of box holders who were overlooked during initial inspections, or who refused to cooperate, were required to be delivered to German inspectors. The sole mission of the DSK was to search and locate assets, not administer them. Reports of violence and torture used in the process of locating and acquiring Jewish gold for the Nazis was widely reported. In France, the unit was led by Herbert Staffeldt and his deputy called Hartmann. The organization was supported by 'a small army' of low-level informers, tipsters, and collaborators known as Vertrauensmänner or \\"V-männer\\" (confidential agents). As the defeat of the German army by Allied forces became evident, actions taken by the DSK to confiscate anything of value to the Nazi state became brutal.

The album received some criticism for failing to maintain the same tone consistently throughout the album. The first five songs feature a slow, deliberate, almost ethereal tone.

Ralph Wille Janssen who was killed in action 26 October 1942 during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands aboard the destroyer . She was laid down by Brown Shipbuilding Co., Houston, Texas, 4 August 1943; launched 10 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Alfred Janssen, stepmother of Lieutenant (j.g.) Janssen; and commissioned 18 December 1943, Lt. Comdr. H. E. Cross in command. =Battle of the Atlantic= Janssen departed 11 January 1944 from Galveston, Texas, to conduct shakedown training out of Bermuda. Upon completion she rendezvoused 27 February with escort carrier and her escorts to form a submarine hunter-killer group. In the months that followed, Janssen and her sister ships attacked numerous submarine contacts while cruising between the United States and the Azores; and, after a brief rest in North African ports, they returned to Norfolk, Virginia, 2 May. Janssen and the Bogue group were soon underway again cruising the convoy routes of the North Atlantic. Hunter-killer groups such as this one became a prime weapon against the U-boat and contributed importantly to the important work of keeping the supply lines to Europe and the Mediterranean open. Janssen arrived New York 24 September 1944 for training exercises, and in December took part in an emergency patrol off the coast of Maine, where increased U-boat activity was anticipated. Early 1945 found Janssen training antisubmarine teams in Casco Bay and the Bermuda area. She got underway on offensive operations once more 28 March and conducted 2 weeks of Atlantic barrier patrol. Joining the Bogue group again 16 April, the ship steamed into the North Atlantic for her last patrol. Several attacks were made on U-boats. was torpedoed and sunk with great loss of life 24 April. Then upon making sonar contact, Janssen, aided by other escorts, closed in on the enemy firing over 40 depth charges, in three separate attacks. Finally, stricken came to the surface where she was destroyed. =Pacific War= The destroyer escort arrived New York 11 May, after the war against Germany had officially ended. She sailed to Norfolk, Virginia, for the installation of additional antiaircraft mounts in preparation for more action, this time against Japan. Janssen conducted training in the Caribbean in June, and arrived Pearl Harbor via the Panama Canal and California 21 August. Too late to take active part in the war against Japan, the ship embarked 100 returning veterans at Pearl Harbor and brought them to San Pedro, California, 9 September. =Decommissioning and fate= Janssen again transited the Panama Canal, arriving Charleston, South Carolina, 25 September. Designated for deactivation, she departed 24 October for Green Cove Springs, Florida, where she decommissioned 12 April 1946. Janssen then joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and, was berthed at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On 1 July 1972 she was struck from the Navy list and she was sold for scrapping 15 October 1973.  Awards  Janssen received one battle star for World War II service and shared in the Presidential Unit Citation awarded to the various ships of the Bogue task groups for outstanding antisubmarine work in the Atlantic during 1943-44.
