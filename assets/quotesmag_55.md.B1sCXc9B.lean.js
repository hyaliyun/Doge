The walls are stacked with red bricks with a clean joint, the window blinds are black, crocheted with thin frames. The white cornices highlight the modern horizontality. A lot of elegant details are added to the overall impression, such as the transparency of the house at the entrance, and the lounge area with a fine furnishings in front of a fireplace lowered to the wall, the balancing verticality of the white chimney.

The Irish term \\"L√°ir Bh√°n\\" translates as \\"White Mare\\". This meaning is identical, and pronounced similarly to, the Manx hobby horse custom known as the Laare Vane. It also has parallels with the Welsh name of the Mari Lwyd, a hobby horse found in southern Wales, which has been translated as \\"Grey Mare\\". Most records of the tradition come from County Kerry. There are various reported instances in which the L√°ir Bh√°n accompanied the Wren Boys during their Christmas time activities. An example of a L√°ir Bh√°n is in the collection of the National Museum of Ireland. Although the origins of the hooded animal traditions in the British Isles are not known with any certainty, the lack of any late medieval references to such practices may suggest that they emerged from the documented elite fashion for hobby horses in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In this, the hooded animal traditions may be comparable to England's Morris dance tradition, which became a \\"nation-wide craze\\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into \\"a set of sharply delineated regional traditions\\".

He organized the expedition that drove the last Caribs out of Martinique and destroyed their villages. Early years (1607‚Äì44) M√©d√©ric (or M√©ry) Rools de Goursolas, esquire, lord of Goursolas in Firbeix, Dordogne, was born around 1607. His parents were Jean Rolle, lord of Goursolas, and Marie de Lafon. His father, a king's judge at Courbefy, Haute-Vienne, died on 3 July 1636. His mother was the daughter of a notary. His brother was Fran√ßois Rolle de Laubi√®re, who later led militia forces on Martinique when Goursolas was acting governor. Martinique under du Parquet (1644‚Äì58) Goursolas was aged 37 when he arrived in Martinique in 1644 with Constant d'Aubign√©. He was accompanied by his brother Fran√ßois Rolle de Loubi√®re. At the end of 1652 the governor of Martinique, Jacques Dyel du Parquet, returned to France for health reasons. He left Goursolas in charge as Major during the minority of his son. On 24 February 1653 Goursolas married Jeanne Hurault, daughter of Claude Jacques Huralt, esquire, and Anne Vinet. Du Parquet appointed Goursolas Lieutenant General of the island on 22 November 1653. Acting governor (1658) Du Parquet died in Saint-Pierre on 3 January 1658 aged 52. After his death his wife Marie Bonnard du Parquet took charge of the island as regent in the name of her oldest son, Dyel d'Esnambuc. Fran√ßois de Loubi√®re, who had married du Parquet's cousin, was appointed guardian of his children. A struggle began between two factions on the island, the Parisians led by Maubray and the Normans led by Plainville. Plainville was named procureur-syndic on 22 July 1658. While Maubray was absent in Antigua, Plainville arrested and imprisoned Mme du Parquet. Goursolas presided over an assembly on 6 August 1658 in which various supporters of the Parisians were removed from office. Goursolas and Plainville signed the minutes of this meeting. After Mme du Parquet agreed to renounce the government, she was freed and restored to her property. Goursolas was in effect governor. In September 1658 Goursolas formed a force of 600 militiamen to eliminate the last Island Caribs from the northern Capesterre region of the island. 200 were carried by sea in five ships under Fran√ßois de Loubi√®re, 200 advanced by land around Mount Pel√©e and 200 by Morne des Gommiers. The Caribs were soon defeated by the overwhelming French forces and fled towards Dominica and Saint Vincent. Their villages were burned, and de Loubi√®re built a small fort on the north coast of Martinique to block their return. Many of the soldiers received land in return for their services and went on to found sugarcane plantation dynasties. The campaign was a decisive event in establishing full French control over the island. Later career (1658‚Äì64) On 15 September 1658 the King appointed du Parquet's son Governor and Lieutenant General of Martinique and Saint Lucia, with his uncle Adrien Dyel, sieur de Vaudroques to act in his place until he reached the age of 20. Goursolas was named Major and Lieutenant General of Martinique on 22 November 1658. Adrien Dyel died on 24 October 1662, and Goursolas served as interim governor until 1663, when he was replaced by Jean Dyel de Clermont. M√©d√©ric Rolle de Goursolas died in 1664. A census of families on Martinique in 1664 listed Madmoiselle Jeanne Herault (38), widow of the deceased M√©d√©ry Rolle, Escuyer, Sieur de Gourselas (M√©d√©ric Rools de Gourselas), and her children √âmond Rolle (7), Adrien Rolle (6), Louis Rolle (5) and Madeleine Rolle (11 months).

Founded in 2002, the company currently operates 57 outlets of coffee shops and food courts in Singapore and one food court in Macau. History Before opening their own coffeeshop, Pang Lim and his wife operated a stall selling bee hoon and nasi lemak in a hawker centre in Hougang. In 1990, Pang Lim and his wife, Ng Hoon Tien, opened their first coffeeshop, Aik Hua and expanded the business in 1992, when the government launched the Sale of Tenanted Shop Scheme, which gave business owners operating out of shops leased from the Government in the public housing estate to buy over their shops instead of renting them, resulting in more business owners renting out the newly bought shops. In 1994, the government further introduced a policy of selling shop houses at subsidised rates to help local enterprises, which enabled Aik Hua to become the largest coffeeshop chain at that time with 56 outlets across the country. In the late 1990s, as food courts became more common, Pang Lim ventured into the food court business with his first food court, Happy Times Food Court in 1996. With increasing competition from the food court industry, Pang found the management of the 56 outlets of coffeeshops difficult as each coffeeshop was run as an independent entity without much synergy to one another. In 2002, Pang Lim sold Aik Hua to the Kopitiam Group for SGD10 million before founding Koufu in that same year. Other than Koufu food courts, the company branched out and operates different concept food courts such as Fork & Spoon, which is a halal food court, The Gallerie, which is inspired by Peranakan cuisine, 1983, which is a coffee shop selling toast and coffee and local cuisine. Koufu also manages Punggol Plaza, a shopping mall located in Punggol through its subsidiary, Abundance Development Pte Ltd. Products and stores Most of Koufu's food courts have a modern contemporary design.

She held the Chair of Early Childhood Education and Care, Melbourne Graduate School of Education, at the University of Melbourne for ten years.  Early life and education  Tayler was raised on a farm near Beaudesert, Queensland, and was educated at boarding school in Brisbane. She graduated as a teacher in 1969 with a Teacher's Certificate (Primary) from Kelvin Grove Teachers College, Brisbane. During her teaching career she gained further qualifications including a Diploma of Teaching at Mount Lawley College of Advanced Education, Perth, and a Bachelor or Education at Edith Cowan University. She completed a PhD in Education in 1987 at the University of Western Australia.  Career  While an academic at the Queensland University of Technology Tayler was co-author of the OECD Thematic Report on Early Childhood Education and Care across 20 countries, titled Starting Strong II: Early Childhood Education and Care (2006). She was selected as a participant in the Australia 2020 Summit in 2008, contributing to the Productivity Agenda (education, skills, training, science and innovation). Tayler was the Chief Investigator of the longitudinal E4Kids study, tracking the quality of Early Childhood education and care programs, and the learning and development of children. The findings of her research influenced the direction of Early Childhood policy and leadership, and fed into early years policy and strategy, including Australia's National Quality Framework. In her role as a teacher and administrator she had a significant impact on the training of early childhood professionals.  Recognition  A scholarship in Tayler's name supports young Indigenous Australian students studying the Master of Teaching at The University of Melbourne. It was established to \\"recognise Indigenous Australians, and to support students in endeavours that promote excellent teaching of young Indigenous children, educational leadership and close collaboration with Indigenous leaders and/or communities\\". In 2018, Tayler was inducted posthumously into the Victorian Honour Roll of Women. The Victorian Department of Education and Training‚Äôs Collette Tayler Excellence in Educational Leadership Award was established to recognise ‚Äúan early childhood service or early years management organisation that has significantly improved learning and teaching practices over the past 18 months‚Äù.

Previously the 10th Lord Lindsay of the Byres, he was created Earl of Lindsay in 1633. He also received the earldom of Crawford following the forfeiture of his cousin, Ludovic Lindsay, 16th Earl of Crawford. He became Treasurer of Scotland in 1644, and in 1645 President of Parliament. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms he played a complex role, but his position was basically a moderate Presbyterian \\"Engager\\" one. He fought for the army of the Scots Parliament at the Battle of Marston Moor, and against the royalist general Montrose at the Battle of Kilsyth, and was eventually captured by the English at Alyth. He then changed sides, and in 1647 he signed the \\"engagement\\" for the release of Charles I, losing all his offices when his enemy, the Marquess of Argyll, obtained the upper hand. After the defeat of the Scots at the Battle of Dunbar in 1650, however, Crawford regained his influence in Scottish politics, but from 1651 to 1660 he was a prisoner in England. In 1661 he was restored to his former dignities, but his refusal to abjure the covenant compelled him to resign them two years later. He married Lady Christian Hamilton, daughter of the Earl of Haddington and was succeeded by his son William Lindsay, 2nd Earl of Lindsay.

She was arrested after two agent provocateurs encouraged her to break a window. The authorities secretly photographed her and identified her as a person who should be kept under surveillance. Life Gretel Schenke was born in Zwickau in 1888. She resulted from her father's second marriage and a family row led to her emigrating to Britain with the name of Margot Schenke in about 1908. She took lodging in Chelsea and fell in with suffragettes and spent her time selling suffragette newspapers. She reported how the police saved her at Hyde Park Corner. Youths, who made her task difficult with sexual remarks became physical' seizing her banner and trying to seize her. She was grateful when two mounted policemen dispersed the youths and others escorted her away and placed her on a bus to go home. The authorities were not so supportive when Schenke was demonstrating against Emmeline Pankhurst's arrest in 1913. She chatted to two other demonstrators and suggested that a stone should be thrown at the Home Office. These two strangers arranged for her to make a telephone call to explain that she may not be home on time. It turned out that the two strangers were agent provocateurs and they tipped off a detective who was ready to arrest her. Margaret Scott is shown here on a police sheet of mugshots Schenke was afraid that she might be deported so she gave her name as Margaret Scott and under this name she was sentenced to a month's imprisonment in Holloway Prison. In an unusual twist she was secretly photographed and she was the first picture on the first of two sheets of photographs that were distributed to police and art galleries to warn them of militant suffragettes. The pictures were taken from a concealed car during prisoners' exercise using an 11-inch powerful lens which had only recently been made in Britain. It was required because the suffragettes would distort their faces when conventional mug shots were being taken and the Home Office was worried by the impact of their arson and vandal attacks. Schenke married Richard Dixon in July 1914 and supported the suffragettes until the outbreak of war. Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst had declared a truce for their suffragettes and Schenke believed that the fight for the vote was more or less won. She did not mention this episode in her life until she saw, for the first time, her photograph in the Sunday Times. She reported that she considered herself as unimportant in the suffragette movement, although she had met Olive Hockin (Number 2), Margaret Macfarlane (Number 3) and Jane Short (Number 6). Her story became a source of pride to her descendants. Schenke died in Ealing in 1973.

Dower and published by W. W. Norton & Company in 1986. The book covers the views of the Japanese and their Western adversaries during the Pacific War, with a particular focus on the United States. Overview In War Without Mercy, Dower ‚Äì who teaches Japanese Studies at the University of California, San Diego ‚Äì casts light on the racist foundation of the Second World War. In describing World War II as a race war, Dower provides details as widely varying as \\"songs, slogans, propaganda reports, secret documents, Hollywood movies, the mass media and quotes from soldiers, leader and politicians\\". Dower contrasts western racism towards Japanese people with attitudes towards Germans/Nazis ‚Äì in the US, Germans overall were differentiated from Nazis. That differentiation was not complete or perfect, but even so it was different from the attitudes towards the entire Japanese people. Immediately after Pearl Harbor (itself part of the reason for the intensity of anti-Japanese sentiment), the U.S. government incarcerated Japanese-Americans in concentration camps, despite the lack of any evidence of any organized activity on the part of Japan within the U.S. Japanese community. Meanwhile the German American Bund had openly supported Hitler right up to the declaration of war. With concrete examples and excruciating detail, Dower illuminates the painful depths of racism, and shows how destructive its real world impacts can be. In the final section, Dower explains how a kind of 'normalcy' of viewpoints was re-established; and how much fragility still exists within our current relations. \\"They [racist stereotypes] remain latent, capable of being revived by both sides in times of crisis and tension.\\" Sections War Without Mercy is divided into four sections. The first section describes the patterns of a race war. The second and third part are a matched set: Part II covers the war from a Western viewpoint, while Part III relays the war as seen by Japanese eyes. Kitano says \\"The point-counterpoint scenario, as the two cultures misunderstand, mis- perceived, misinterpret and attempt to justify the destruction of each other is skillfully done.\\" The final part is an epilogue, explaining how those intense viewpoints subsided, but may not have entirely disappeared.

He is best known for being a former guitarist of Adam and the Ants under the name Johnny Bivouac, during which time he recorded the track Deutscher Girls with the band, later a UK Top 15 hit single. As an actor, he is best known for the role of Strings in the police sitcom Operation Good Guys. Adam and the Ants and other bands In June 1977, Beckett was guitarist in the band Desolation Angels when their drummer, David Barbarossa was recruited away from the group by a recently formed punk band, The Ants, who had supported them at a concert in Chelsea that month. Four months later, after the Ants sacked their guitarist Mark Ryan, Beckett was recruited as his replacement and took the stagename Johnny Bivouac. Bivoauc stayed with the band, shortly thereafter renamed Adam and the Ants, until May 1978, recording the band's first Peel session on 23 January 1978 and the following day recording Deutscher Girls for the soundtrack album of Derek Jarman's film Jubilee.Antcatalogue (distributed with album Kings Of The Wild Frontier by Adam and the Ants, CBS Records CBS 84549, 1980) p11 Antshows & Events Label E.G. Records released the track as a single A side in February 1982, to cash in on the later commercial success of the Ants' early 1980s incarnation. This reached 13 on the UK singles chart. After leaving the band, Bivouac was a member of Ryan's band Lustralarza and later Swim. In 1980 he was invited to join the new Ants as bass player, but declined, with the role eventually going to Kevin Mooney. He has continued to use the pseudonym Johnny Bivouac for any guitar credits since leaving the Ants.The Art School Dance Goes On Forever, The Complete Rock Family Trees, Pete Frame. Omnibus Press 1993. Production work Later on, Bivouac set up his own studio facility to help develop his production and composition, while continuing to work live with various bands as a guitarist and, occasionally, keyboard player. He worked as a composer and producer on various corporate videos and advertising jingles before composing his first work for mainstream television Carlton's The Spooks of Bottle Bay. He has since worked on numerous film and TV projects as either composer, music producer, music supervisor and/or performer. Beckett has produced and remixed artists as diverse as Freddie Mercury Denise van Outen and Rolf Harris. He also dabbled in hard-core techno with the project Vagen, following his scoring of a three-part series about the history of the Volkswagen Beetle. Fugitive Group In the 1990s, Beckett became a partner in British independent film/TV company Fugitive Features (responsible for such films as The Krays, Death Machine and The Passion of Darkly Noon), initially running their music publishing division, Fugitive Music Ltd. Soon he was involved in all areas of the company's activities including production, administration and music supervision. As of November 2010 he was a director of the Group. Acting Beckett appeared as Strings in the BBC comedy series Operation Good Guys, where he portrayed a musically frustrated policeman.

Civilian life  Nazarova was born on 1 October 1920 to a Russian peasant family in Ostrov city of Pskov. Her father died from complications of a wound sustained in World War I when Klavdiya was at a young age. In addition to completing ten grades of school she attended the Lesgaft National State University of Physical Education, Sport and Health of Leningrad for one year and was a senior leader of a Young Pioneer detachment at a local school. She was a member of the Komsomol. In her later years she worked as a seamstress.  Partisan activities  Shortly after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 Nazarova signed up for training to become a nurse but was soon appointed by the District Party Committee as the deputy commander of a youth paramilitary battalion assigned to tracking down and capturing Axis paratroopers entering the city. However the group was overrun by numerically superior forces and most members of the unit fled Ostrov after the German occupation began. In July 1941 Nazarova hosted a group of resistance members in her apartment, and the group decided that she should be the official leader of the partisan detachment they had formed. Initially they gathered weapons for Soviet prisoners of war and partisans and helped injured Red Army soldiers find their way to Soviet-controlled territory by providing them with maps, compasses, weapons, and provisions while they were in a hospital where Nazarova worked as a nurse. Later they managed to get their hands on blank passports and provided the prisoners with forged versions of documents they were required to carry by German authorities. The group began engaging in reconnaissance activities after one of the partisans began working at a German mess hall, and even took the risk of posting leaflets listing atrocities committed by the German military at a local Wehrmacht headquarters. The unit's sabotage operations included cutting telephone cables, setting fire to office buildings and barracks, derailing trains, and even causing regular power outages after one of the partisans began working at a power plant. The group's most crucial activities consisted of stealing a map of plans for the Leningrad blockade and providing the Soviet Airforce with information of the location of a fuel depot for bombing. A group of several people loyal to the partisans were caught while trying to cross the border into Soviet-controlled territory. One killed herself by swallowing poison but two of the Red Army soldiers that were captured revealed the names of the partisans under torture. The partisans were arrested and on 12 December 1942 Nazarova was publicly executed by the Germans in the Ostrov city square. After she was hanged her lifeless corpse was left on the gallows for three days before she was buried. On 20 August 1945 she was posthumously declared a Hero of the Soviet Union.

Touzani is known as a critic of both Islamism, the far-right, and the politically correct left. He is an ex- Muslim and has received fatwa's and hundreds of death threats because of his public apostasy, especially from Muslims.  Biography  Touzani's parents came from the Rif in Morocco. They came to Belgium in 1964 during a migration wave. When Touzani was 8 years old, he and his parents took part in a demonstration against racism, which had a deep and lasting impact on him. He began to develop a strong interest in protest, political ideologies, forms of government and human rights. In this formative period, the Belgian-Moroccan dissident Mohammed el Baroudi had an important influence on the evolution of his ideas. He chose democracy and dialogue over violent resistance and authoritarianism. He discovered theatre, comedy and humour as a means to make people think, question their views and start necessary discussions about societal issues. He read up on philosophy and psychoanalysis, two ways of thinking which made him very critical of religion, and publicly renounce his Islamic faith at the age of 19. After the November 2015 Paris attacks, which were prepared in the Brussels municipality of Molenbeek, Touzani kept performing in Brussels, despite the heightened fears of new terrorist attacks and amid militarised security forces on the streets. He stated it was important not to give in to fear, and that he would maintain his 'sharp critique of Islamists, nationalists and extremists.' His new show Les enfants de Dom Juan, co-written by Ben Hamidou, was his response to the attacks, in which he demands the Muslim community to critically reflect on their beliefs and behaviour, that motivated some of its members towards radicalisation and terrorism. It also sought to break the taboo on homosexuality and apostasy within the Muslim community. Parti Socialiste politician Philippe Moureaux (former burgemeester of Molenbeek 1993‚Äì2012) banned Touzani from performing in the municipality for 10 years, and the show was boycotted by the inhabitants and associations of Molenbeek.  Views  Touzani is an 'atheist', an 'ex- Muslim' and 'irreligious', but he doesn't like those terms because they indicate what he is not, while there are many things he does believe in, namely 'humanity, nature and humane laws.' He is a great admirer of Richard Dawkins, the editors of Charlie Hebdo (many of whom he knows/knew personally), sympathises with the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (pastafarianism), and in one of his shows he announced his own parody religion of Touzanism. Touzani often takes part in the public debate, and rebukes both far-right extremists (amongst which he includes Vlaams Belang) and Islamists who regularly send him death threats and have even attacked him physically for being an ex-Muslim and openly criticising Islam. Neither does he want 'the politically correct left' to tell him how to behave, and he refuses to use the term 'Islamophobia', \\"not even a second; that concept is being used to make any criticism [of Islam] impossible, and silence the real debate.\\" Furthermore, he criticises cultural relativism: \\"Our country emphasies ethnic- religious diversity and rights, while equality, citizenship and transparency come in second place. It should be the other way around.\\" According to Touzani, Islam is in desperate need of reform, similar to how the Catholic Church has implemented an aggiornamento at the Second Vatican Council; otherwise it will disappear due to its 'rigidity'.

He is known only by a shattered false door made from pink granite; the fragments contain his name, two titles (\\"dignitary\\" and \\"vizier\\"), and the initial part of the conventional ancient Egyptian offering formula. The false door is of unknown provenience, but it is possible that it was unearthed by French archaeologist Jacques de Morgan at the end of the 19th century, during his excavations at Dahshur. The finding then found its way to an auction on whose catalogue it was spotted in 1996. It appeared again on the art market in 2015.

This is in contrast to a beached or stranded whale, which reaches land alive and may die there or regain safety in the ocean. Most cetaceans that die, from natural causes or predators, do not wind up on land; most die far offshore and sink deep to become novel ecological zones known as whale fall. Some species that wash ashore are scientifically dolphins, i.e. members of the family Delphinidae, but for ease of use, this article treats them all as \\"drift whales\\". For example, one species notorious for mass strandings is the pilot whale, also known as \\"blackfish\\", which is taxonomically a dolphin. A sperm whale stranded on 3 February 1598 on the Dutch sea-coast. For more than 200 years, this image was the best-known representation of the species. In historical sources, it is not always clear whether a given cetacean washed up alive or dead, but the term \\"drift whale\\" focuses on the benefits of its carcass ‚Äì meat, blubber, fat, and other products ‚Äì to the people who claimed it. Nowadays, when a dead whale washes up on a beach, often the authorities are required to dispose of it as a potential hazard to human health, so the resource implications go the other way: a drift whale is no longer a benefit to a community, but an expensive disadvantage. Overview =Species= An illustration of \\"Whales\\" from the German encyclopedia Meyers Konversations- Lexikon. The fin whale and the dolphin are depicted as beached. Many cetacean species have been documented as drift whales, but some are more common than others. In New England, for example, the carcasses of fin, humpback, sperm, right, and pilot whales, as well as dolphins, are most likely to drift ashore. Some species have a naturally high buoyancy, and float when they are dead, aided by the gases of putrefaction. Whales that live in the pelagic ocean, far from the continental shelf, are less likely to wash up ashore than coastal species. Once these deep-sea animals do find themselves in shallower waters, however, they may run into difficulties, as the gradual shelving of the shoreline is thought to play a role in confusing their sense of echolocation. Sperm whale strandings are known to have occurred in the North Sea for centuries, and the incidents may be increasing with louder ship noise. =Reasons= A beachcomber examining the marks of great white shark bites Eubalaena glacialis dead, apparently from ship strike Aside from the whaling industry, most cetaceans have no predators other than the orca (killer whale) and certain large sharks (such as the dusky), which in both cases tend to attack in groups and focus on one young whale. Some drift whale carcasses show injuries consistent with attacks from these species, or, in modern times, with ship strikes (e.g., trauma from a propeller). Another obvious and visible cause of traumatic death is cetacean bycatch, i.e., entanglement with fishing gear, which kills tens of thousands each year, according to the International Whaling Commission. Eubalaena glacialis necroscopy, performed on the beach Other carcasses show no visible injury, and theories about why the animals died include the possibilities discussed for live strandings (especially active sonar) as well as illness and malnutrition. Sometimes a necroscopy is performed, which can reveal the cause of death, such as ingestion of plastic pollution and other Marine debris. =Locations= A sperm whale carcass serves as food for gulls and Arctic fox. Illustration from Animals in Action (1901). Certain beaches are well known as likely spots for whales, and other gifts from the sea, to wash up: drift seeds, driftwood, and latterly sea glass and even messages in bottles. Modern recreational beachcombers use knowledge of how storms, geography, ocean currents, and seasonal events determine the arrival and exposure of rare finds; the same applies to those looking out for drift whales. Eponymous coastal features include Drift Whale Bay within Brooks Peninsula Provincial Park on the Pacific Coast of Vancouver Island. Saint- Cl√©ment-des-Baleines on the Atlantic coast of France is named after its stranding beach. Scavenging versus hunting People have been using drift whales for millennia, long before the beginning of active whaling. However, in relying on the archaeological record, the distinction between first scavenging and then hunting is not clear-cut. =Whales as windfall= Makah flensing a whale at Neah Bay, Washington, 1910 Semi-underground structure (qargi) with bowhead whale bones, Tikiƒ°aƒ°miut, Point Hope, Alaska, 1885 A whale's massive carcass would provide a coastal community with considerable amounts of meat and fat, without the danger and effort of venturing onto the open ocean to harpoon a living leviathan. (An additional resource, in the treeless Arctic, was the long bones, useful for construction.) Whale meat is still valued in some countries; blubber can be eaten (especially welcome in very cold climates) or processed into whale oil, once a widely used fuel. The bounty and good fortune inherent in this find are recognised in etymology: \\"The meaning of the word 'drift-whale' in Icelandic, 'hvalreki,' has the same meaning as 'wind-fall' ‚Äì an unexpected good incurred at no cost\\", according to Sigr√∫n Dav√≠√∞sd√≥ttir, London correspondent of the Icelandic national broadcaster R√öV. Two anthropologists, Thomas Talbot Waterman and Alfred Louis Kroeber, who worked with Yurok informants in California, classified drift whales as a gathered resource, rather than a product of hunting, as those beneficiaries ran no risk. =Pre-contact aboriginal= Coastal people around the world came up with a technique called dolphin drive hunting, which exploits the animals' tendency to beach themselves. This sort of hunt, which depends on substantial community co-operation, still continues in a few places, as far apart as the North Atlantic (Whaling in the Faroe Islands), the South Pacific (Malaita dolphin drive hunt), and Japan (Taiji dolphin drive hunt). It is harder to find evidence, archaeological or ethnographic, of North American indigenous people hunting large whales before cultural contact with Europeans, according to scholars of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. =From scavenging to hunting= Men flensing a whale in California, circa 1901 The skills learned from processing drift whales, such as flensing (stripping the blubber), may have led to seeking out live ones. For example, the Makah of Washington State have been hunting grey whales for at least 1500 years, but were harvesting stranded whales for many centuries before that. On the other side of North America, drift whale scavenging on the Outer Banks of North Carolina led to organised hunts, documented at the Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum. When the early settlers arrived in New England, they saw from the deck of the Mayflower a huge number of whales, far more than they were accustomed to see in European waters, according to American historian W. Jeffrey Bolster. 1500 pilot whales driven ashore at Cape Cod in 1885, and sold for a considerable sum for their oil March 1644, in Southhampton, Long Island, saw the first recorded attempt of the New England colonists \\"to organize community efforts to hunt drift whales.‚Äù The Native Americans had developed the technique of herding pilot whales onto the shelving beaches for slaughter; the colonists observed this, practised flensing the carcasses and rendering the blubber, improved on their weapons and boats, and then progressed to hunting on the ocean. This early drift whaling at Southampton led gradually to the nearby Sag Harbor whaling fleet becoming the biggest in New York State, according to a curator at the local whaling museum. Tribes in Nantucket guarded and traded as sachem their ownership of drift whales assiduously. They were able to use their ownership and early treaties as a way to avoid royal taxes on the products. =Both scavenging and hunting= Some communities both hunted and scavenged. William Barr, the Arctic historian, gives two examples of the late eighteenth century: the Moravian missions on Labrador, and possibly the Inuit of Hudson Strait, who had a trading relationship with the supply ships of the Hudson's Bay Company. However, Barr assumes that the drift whales were ones that the Inuit hunters (or possibly the European whaling ships) had harpooned and wounded, and the carcasses had come ashore some time later.  Risks  A dead whale, belly up, distended with gas A dead humpback, showing the extrusion of the penis Wrapped in a thick blanket of blubber, the carcass retains its mammalian heat, and the process of decomposition takes place relatively quickly; once ashore, there is a risk of the swollen whale exploding. That is a rare event, but more commonly, the build-up of pressure inside the abdominal cavity can lead to the extrusion of the whale's penis through the genital slit. A similar phenomenon, postmortem fetal extrusion, can occur to the carcass of a pregnant whale: Tim Flannery wrote that \\"A rotting whale could fill with gas to bursting, ejecting a fetus the size of a motor vehicle with sufficient force to kill a man.\\" Consumption of drift whale carcasses, particularly if they have been dead for a long time, carries risks of food poisoning or worse. In 2002, fourteen residents of a Bering Sea fishing village ate muktuk (skin and blubber) from a beluga whale which they \\"estimated had been dead for at least several weeks\\", resulting in eight of them developing botulism, with two of the affected requiring mechanical ventilation. The Centers for Disease Control recommended boiling Alaska Native dishes to rid them of the botulism toxin. Mythology and ritual Maquinna, chief of the Mowachaht people of Yuquot. Drift whales are a feature of fables and mythology. For example, William of Barkley Sound on Vancouver Island recounted tales to Edward Sapir, which were re-told by Kathryn Anne Bridge in a compendium about the Huu-ay-aht First Nations. The chiefs of certain West Coast peoples built private sacred places, called whalers' washing houses, where they could ritually purify themselves. The spiritual preparation that they undertook was not only for skill in the chase of living whales, but also to attract drift whales to their beach. The good fortune of the chief was understood to be tied to the spirit world, and the remains of human ancestors - especially the skulls - were used to ask for \\"whaling magic\\". The best known of these is the Yuquot Whalers Shrine, associated with the great Mowachaht chief Maquinna. The neighbouring Nuu-chah- nulth and Makah peoples used similar shrines to pull drift whales to them. Food resource Two women enjoying muktuk outside their summer tent, 2002 proposed that drift whales might have formed a considerable summer food resource for people living on the coast of what is now Oregon, before contact with Europeans. Rights Icelanders dividing a whale, from a manuscript from the 16th century Peoples that value whale meat and blubber have kept an eye out for drift whales, and traded the rights to them, for example bartering access to inland fishing rivers. Specific people may have hereditary rights to drift whales and a particular locale.

She combined this with a political career, sitting as a member of the East German parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\") for four decades between 1950 and 1990. She was a member not of the ruling SED (party) but of the National Democratic Party of Germany (\\"National-Demokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / NDPD), one of the smaller Block Parties which contributed a semblance of pluralism to the country's political structure.  Life  = Provenance and early years = Ilse Haupt was born into a working class family in D√ºsseldorf. During 1921/22 she attended a course at a commercial training college in D√ºsseldorf which led to a qualification as a typist. Between 1925 and 1938 she worked in Hamburg as a typist-secretary. She also found time, between 1926 and 1928, to obtain extra income with cleaning jobs, and to train as an actress, then working as a stage actress in Hamburg till 1933. Her daughter Ruth was born on 4 August 1929. Between 1931 and 1933 she was a member - and later the leader - of the \\"Kollektiv Hamburg\\" theatre troupe. = Nazi years = She joined the Communist Party and the Revolutionary Trades Union Opposition (\\"Revolution√§re Gewerkschafts Opposition\\" / RGO) movement in 1931. In January 1933 the Nazis took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. She continued to work for the Communists which was now by definition illegal. She was arrested in March 1933 and held briefly. A longer period of \\"protective detention\\" followed in 1933/34, for \\"producing antifascist publications\\" (wegen \\"Herstellung antifaschistischer Publikationen\\"). Her detention included a short stay in a concentration camp. After she was released she was served with an employment ban (\\"Berufsverbot\\"), but was able to keep her head above water by writing. Ilse Rodenberg's relationships with men is a topic that, in the words of one admiring commentator, involved much flexibility. She was married five times or perhaps only three: opinions vary. There is more agreement over the large number of affairs she conducted outside marriage, something about which, even by the standards of the time and place, she was always remarkably open. By 1943/44, as a result of one of her marriages, she had become known as Ilse Weintraut-Rinka. During the final part of the war she was conscripted for war work which involved forcible relocation to northern Bavaria. = Return to Hamburg = Directly after the war she returned to Hamburg and her theatre work, heading up and acting in the satirical-political cabaret \\"Laternenanz√ºnder\\" (loosely, \\"Lamp lighters\\"). Hamburg had ended up in the British military occupation zone, and it was probably on account of her political convictions that in 1948 Ilse Weintraut-Rinka relocated to the Soviet occupation zone. She had rejoined the Communist Party in 1945 and now accepted an invitation to become a founder member of the National Democratic Party (\\"National-Demokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / NDPD) which was established that year under the auspices of the ruling (if only in the Soviet zone) Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED\\" / SED). \\"We already have enough communists like you in our party,\\" the SED party strategists explained, \\"[but] we still need some in the other parties!\\" = Theatre = Between 1948 and 1950 she worked as an \\"Intendantin\\" (theatre director) in Ludwigslust, also undertaking the same role at the theatre in nearby Neustrelitz. Between 1950 and 1958 she then took charge at the Brandenburg Regional Theatre (as it was then known) in Potsdam. At that time the theatre had three sections, and she presided over a major expansion of the facilities to satisfy the \\"theatre-hunger\\" of the populations in the surrounding villages. In the slogan of the times, the theatre company worked to bring \\"theatre to the country\\" (\\"Kunst aufs Land\\"). In 1952 she had the satisfaction of presiding over the renaming of the theatre, in honour of the communist actor Hans Otto, whom the Nazis had murdered in 1933. She moved on again in 1958, taking over as theatre director at the \\"Friendship Theatre\\" (\\"Theater der Freundschaft \\") in East Berlin. The Friendship Theatre had been founded by Hans Rodenberg in 1950 and was the first theatre in Berlin that was targeted explicitly on children and adolescents. At the time, the only larger theatre of this nature was reportedly the \\"Children's Theatre\\" (\\"–¥–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π –º—É–∑—ã–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Ç–µ–∞—Ç—Ä\\") in Moscow. After 1958 Ilse Rodenberg played a central role in winning political and public backing for a dedicated children's theatre in Berlin. She had married Hans Rosenberg (1895-1978) on 22 December 1956 and was able to benefit from his excellent political connections with he higher echelons of the political establishment. For both the Rodenbergs, Walter Ulbricht and Erich Honecker were friends who could be addressed using the informal \\"second person singular\\": \\"Mit Ulbricht und mit Honecker war sie per Du\\". This was important in a country where contacts were often more important than contracts. = The political establishment = Between 1950 and 1954 Ilse Rodenberg served as a member of the national executive (\\"Bundesvorstand\\") of the Democratic Women's League (\\"Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\\" / DFD), one of several government backed mass organisations commonly included in Leninist government power structures, and designed to broaden the domestic political support base of the ruling party. The DFD even had its own quota of twenty seats (later increased to thirty-five) in the national parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\"), provided by the ruling SED (party), which controlled the DFD's key appointments through a shadowy administrative structure known as the National Front. It was, however, as one of the five Berlin members of the NDPD (party) that Ilse Weintraut-Rinka was allocated her own seat in the Volkskammer in 1950. After the general election of 1954 the allocation of seats to the NDPD's Berlin members was increased from five to seven, and records identify her as Ilse Rodenberg. The seven Berlin members were part of a larger contingent of fifty-two NDPB members representing the whole of East Germany. It was only after March 1990, when East Germany conducted its first and last free and fair general election, that the number of seats won by the NDPD slumped from fifty-two to two, and Ilse Rodenberg's name ceased to appear on the list of Volkskammer members. Sources are for the most part silent over her contributions and it is unlikely that her parliamentary duties occupied much of her time. The country's highly centralised power structure concentrated political decisions not on any parliament nor even on government ministers but on the Central Committee and Politburo of the ruling party, although this stark reality was softened to the extent that influential Central Committee members were often also Volkstag members. From 1963 Ilse Rodenberg was a member of the presidential council (\\"Pr√§sidialrat\\") of the National Culture Association (\\"Kulturbund\\"). She also served, between 1967 and 1982, as chair of the NDPD Party Control Commission, filling a post that had become vacant through the death of Jonny L√∂hr. In 1964 Ilse Rodenberg became a member of the Committee of Antifascist Fighters (\\"Komitee der Antifaschistischen Widerstandsk√§mpfer\\"), an organisation closely algned with the ruling Socialist Unity Party, which had emerged out of the postwar Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime (\\"Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes \\") and which was dedicated to preserving anti-fascist traditions. In 1966 she was a founder member of the Association of Theatre Creatives (\\"Verband der Theaterschaffenden\\"), becoming a member of its presidium and, later, honorary president. She also involved herself from 1965 with the International Association of Theatre for Children and Young People (ASSITEJ), serving three terms as its honorary president between 1978 and 1987. She created the bi- annual International Directors Seminar along with the Hallenser Workshop Meeting and Playwright‚Äôs Competition.

Menciona que el apellido es De Giusti. ElOrtiba.org Art√≠culo del periodista Horacio Verbitsky que menciona a un polic√≠a ferroviario llamado Walter Alfredo De Giusti, que estuvo relacionado con el traslado de armas para perpetrar la masacre de Ezeiza del 20 de junio de 1973.  Biography  = Youth = De Giusti studied at Dante Alighieri high school in Rosario, where he met P√°ez. At that time De Giusti played bass in a heavy metal band, while P√°ez studied piano and lived with his father and grandmothers, who acted as mothers, since the mother of P√°ez - the concert pianist Margarita Zulema √Åvalos - died when he was eight months old. = First murder = De Giusti's killings began on October 31, 1986, when the then 23-year old Walter and 18-year-old brother Carlos Manuel De Giusti, entered a house on Garay Street 1081 in the city of Rosario while carrying out plumbing tasks. There he beat and stabbed two women: √Ångela Cristofanetti de Barroso (aged 86) and her adopted daughter Naomi (aged 31). = Fito P√°ez's grandmothers = A week later, at noon on November 7, 1986, on Balcarce Street 681 in the same city, the De Giusti brothers committed another brutal crime. Belia Delia Zulema Ram√≠rez, widow of P√°ez, 76-years old (paternal grandmother of Fito), Josefa P√°ez, 80-years old (paternal aunt of Fito) and Fermina Godoy, 33-years old (domestic worker for the P√°ez family, who was also pregnant) were shot and stabbed. It is believed that De Giusti - 24 years old at the time - knew and frequented the home of the victims. = Joining the police = One month later, on December 4, 1986, De Giusti became a police officer for the sub-office of Pueblo Esther, located 15 kilometres south of Rosario. = Investigation = It took the Rosario police almost a year to decipher the crime. Finally, De Giusti was betrayed by a local transvestite, who wore a necklace that belonged to one of P√°ez's grandmothers and declared - with an undercover agent - that it was a gift from \\"her boyfriend Walter.\\" The next day, the police raided the house of the De Giusti family, who lived on G√ºemes Street 2130, a few blocks north of the P√°ez family. The first thing that was found upon entry was an engraver which Fito P√°ez had given to his grandmother Belia. = Trial = The justice charged De Giusti of quintuple murder as the sole perpetrator of the crimes. Before Judge Benjam√≠n √Åvalos, De Giusti confessed to the five killings. On August 24, 1987, Judge √Åvalos sentenced him to life imprisonment in the Coronda prison in Santa Fe. His brother, Carlos, who at the time was 19 years old, was detained under probation for his participation in the act. All this time was followed closely by the Rosario police since he was considered dangerous. Once held in prison, De Giusti was taken to compulsory police retirement: he continued to receive 70 percent of his salary for six more years, until November 1993. Nine years after his life imprisonment in May 1996, De Giusti's defence requested that his sentence be reduced to 25 years. Then, in August 1997, he requested a commutation and obtained a benefit that lowered his sentence 24 years and 7 months. Finally, and taking into account that he contracted HIV in prison, the defence requested that De Giusti serve the sentence in his home. After a medical examination, the coroners informed Judge Lura that the former policeman was practically blind. This was key to magistrate to arrange a house arrest. = Freedom and death = A year later in 1998, a neighbour of former judge Benjam√≠n √Åbalos (who had sentenced him in 1987, and was already retired), told him that De Giusti was walking through the streets of Rosario and was always going to a bar in the northwest corner of San Luis and Balcarce streets. √Åbalos consulted with the owner of the bar. He inquired if De Giusti really was there, and owner told him that he came by everyday. He even said that the condemned man boasted about his sentence. Also, although De Giusti was under house arrest for alleged blindness, several witnesses had seen him driving a yellow Fiat 600 car. When this irregularity was verified, √Åbalos contacted Judge Lura and told him everything. On May 19, 1998, the provincial government issued a decree exonerating De Giusti from the police and the prosecution was asked to force him to return all the collected money. On Wednesday, May 27, 1998, at 5:45 PM, Lura was able to verify that De Giusti was at his house, thus violating the house arrest. On Wednesday, June 3, 1998, at 12:30 noon, by order of Judge Efra√≠n Lura, De Giusti was admitted to the Rosario prison to properly serve his sentence. The magistrate on a report from the medical board which ruled that the former policeman was compensated and did not present foreseeable complications. But on Monday, June 8, De Giusti decompensated, so he was admitted to a hospital in Granadero Baigorria. On Wednesday, June 10, he was referred to the American Sanatorium in Rosario, where he died due to HIV/AIDS complications on Friday, June 12, 1998.

It shows antibiotic activity against most Gram-positive bacteria. It is one of the most potent cytotoxic molecules known, due to its induction of a higher ratio of DNA double-strand breaks than single-strand breaks. C-1027's chromophore contains a nine-membered enediyne that is responsible for most of the molecule's biological activity. Unlike other enediynes, this molecule contains no triggering mechanism. It is already primed to undergo the cycloaromatization reaction without external activation to produce the toxic 1,4-benzenoid diradical species. C-1027 can induce oxygen-independent interstrand DNA crosslinks in addition to the oxygen- dependent single- and double-stranded DNA breaks typically generated by other enediynes. This unique oxygen-independent mechanism suggests that C-1027 may be effective against hypoxic tumor cells. center C-1027 shows promise as an anticancer drug and is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials in China, with a 30% success rate. It can induce apoptosis in many cancer cells and recent studies have indicated that it induces unusual DNA damage responses to double-strand breaks, including altering cell cycle progression and inducing chromosomal aberrations.

It is located on the south side of Westfaling Street west of the city centre.  History  Until 1791 all burials in Hereford took place within the precincts of Hereford Cathedral. After that date the four parishes in the city were required to make their own provision for burials. By 1853 there were 11 cemeteries in the city (seven associated with the Church of England and four with dissenting parishes) as well as small burial sites at several hospitals. In 1849 a company was created to establish a general cemetery for the city and its neighbourhood but disagreements with the Bishop of Hereford meant that by 1853 this general cemetery had not been created. By 1876 Hereford burials were taking place at Hereford Cemetery. In 1939 the addition of a crematorium was discussed at a council meeting but was reported as ‚Äúnot likely to be considered for some time‚Äù. A foundation stone was finally laid for a crematorium at Hereford Cemetery in 1955.

Common names include silverleaf spurflower, Swedish ivy, Oertendahl‚Äôs spurflower, November lights, and Brazilian coleus though it is native to eastern South Africa rather than Brazil. Plectranthus oertendahlii and the cultivar ‚ÄòUvongo‚Äô have gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. Description Growing to tall, it is a tender forest- dwelling perennial, with somewhat succulent heart-shaped leaves whose surface is strikingly marked with silver, while the undersides are a deep reddish purple. The undersides contain the chemical anthocyanin, which helps to trap what little light is available beneath the forest canopy. The stems are square, creeping and rooted. The leaves are slightly succulent, rounded to rhombic and roughly serrated. The top of the leaves is dark green with silver veins in silver, the underside is deep red. The pink-tinged white or pale blue flowers, held in erect sprays above the foliage, are double-lipped and resemble those of its relatives in the genus Salvia (sage). It blooms in autumn and winter. Cultivation P. oertendahlii is named for Ivan Anders Oertendahl of Sweden‚Äôs Uppsala University. Nobody knows how the plant reached Sweden, but it has been cultivated in Scandinavia for over a century, and remains popular there. It increases both by setting seed and by putting down roots as it spreads along the ground. This plant and its cultivars are widely grown as ornamentals, often under its former name Coleus which no longer exists. In temperate climates it is grown as a houseplant, as it does not tolerate temperatures below . However, plants may be placed outside in a warm shaded area during the summer months.

The scientific community currently views the practice as essentially pseudoscientific, with comparisons to snake oil. There are also concerns of harm. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in 2019, cautioned \\"consumers against receiving young donor plasma infusions\\" stating that they are an \\"unproven treatment\\".  Research  Experiments beginning in the 1950s in the Cornell University lab of Clive McCay on pairs of old and young rodents placed into parabiosis provided some evidence, albeit limited and \\"largely anecdotal\\", that the circulation of blood from young mice increased both the longevity and the tissue function of old mice. After decades in which relatively little work on parabiosis in aging was done, the work was revived by researchers at Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley. Parabiosis experiments are difficult to generalize, as the circulatory systems of the mice are fully joined and it is unclear whether the benefits come from the sharing of blood or the older mouse's access to the younger mouse's organs. A study conducted at UC Berkeley found that when delivered alone, blood from older mice was more inhibitory to the regenerative capacities of younger mice than blood from younger mice was beneficial to older ones, and that the benefit of young blood in older mice was than had been observed when older mice were subjected to parabiosis. In experiments like this, researchers found that some of the parabiosed died quickly (11 out of 69 in one experiment) for reasons the scientists could not explain, but described as possibly some form of immune rejection; most such cases were the young parabiont.. Amy Wagers, a researcher who coauthored several mouse studies on young blood transfusion, has said that her papers do not provide a scientific basis for some of the existing human trials. A review of studies on donor age for whole blood transfusions reported that blood from donors under the age of 20 years, when compared to donors aged 20‚Äì60 years, resulted in a modestly higher risk of death in the recipients. However, other studies have found no effect of age. Research on blood transfusion outcomes has been complicated by the lack of careful characterization of the transfusion products that have been used in clinical trials; studies had focused on how storage methods and duration might affect blood, but not on the differences among lots of blood themselves. Commercial development In February 2019 the FDA warned about companies offering young blood transfusions stating: \\"simply put, we‚Äôre concerned that some patients are being preyed upon by unscrupulous actors touting treatments of plasma from young donors as cures and remedies. Such treatments have no proven clinical benefits for the uses for which these clinics are advertising them and are potentially harmful. There are reports of bad actors charging thousands of dollars for infusions that are unproven and not guided by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials. The promotion of plasma for these unproven purposes could also discourage patients suffering from serious or intractable illnesses from receiving safe and effective treatments that may be available to them.\\" = Ambrosia = A startup company, Ambrosia, has been selling \\"young blood transfusions\\" for $8,000 since 2016 under the guise of running a clinical trial, to see if such transfusions lead to changes in the blood of recipients. As of August 2017, they had 600 people join. The clinical trial has no control arm and so is neither randomized nor blind. As described, whole blood collected by blood banks that had passed its 42-day storage limit was centrifuged to remove cells, the resulting cell-free plasma pooled from several donations and intravenously transfused into recipients. The company was started by Jesse Karmazin, a medical school graduate without a license to practice medicine. David Wright is the licensed doctor overseeing the clinical trial; in his practice he administers intravenous treatments of vitamins and antibiotics for nontraditional purposes and was disciplined by the California Medical Board for the latter in 2015. Jonathan Kimmelman, a bioethicist from McGill University, suggests that Ambrosia is running this as a trial as they would be unable to get FDA approval to sell this treatment otherwise. On February 19, 2019, Ambrosia announced it stopped testing the treatment, responding to concerns from the FDA. = Alkahest = Another company, Alkahest, was founded based on the Stanford rodent studies. As of 2017 it is collaborating with European pharmaceutical company Grifols to create a blood plasma-based experimental biologic drug which they propose to test on people with Alzheimer's. = Maharaj/Faloon trial = Scientific American reported in 2018 that young blood transfusion was being offered as a paid \\"trial\\", which, like Ambrosia's trial, had no distinct control group from the treatment; it also charged participants $285,000 per person. Dipnarine Maharaj, a Florida physician running the trial, has previously offered both traditional and nontraditional anti-aging treatments such as stem cell banking. He also has ties to the Hippocrates Health Institute, an organization promoting unproven alternative medicine. This trial was promoted by Bill Faloon, who founded the Life Extension Foundation, which was raided by the FDA In 1987 for illegally importing medicine, though the case was dropped in 1996. = Young Blood Institute = An organization called the Young Blood Institute has also run trials; these, however, involved exchange only of blood plasma.  Conspiracy theories  = QAnon theory = The online conspiracy theory that calls itself \\"QAnon\\" alleges, without offering any evidence, that Hollywood and political \\"elites\\" are keeping themselves young with adrenal compounds extracted from the blood of kidnapped children.

It consists of qualification rounds in North America, South America, Europe, and Oceania, and culminates in a playoff bracket with teams from those regions. The qualification rounds are played as an online round-robin tournament and the finals are played live in different cities. The Season 9 championship in 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with other online events being held in place of it. History Psyonix had observed the popularity of Rocket League matches on Twitch and other live streaming platforms by early 2016 and were looking to use the game more in esports. In March 2016, Psyonix announced the first Rocket League Championship Series; the finals took place in August 2016 with a 55,000 prize pool. The second season of the championship series took place in December 2016 with a $125,000 prize pool. A third series began in March 2017, with the $300,000 prize pool finals taking place three months later. In this season, two teams from the oceanic region were also invited to compete. A second division, the Rocket League Rival Series (RLRS), was added in Season 4. The two teams finishing at the bottom of the RLCS and the two teams finishing at the top of the RLRS for each region play each other in a promotion tournament at the end of the season to determine if teams are promoted or relegated. At the advent of Season 5 in June 2018, Psyonix organised and managed the event alone. Previous to this, they partnered with Twitch. Season 6 started in September 2018 and featured a million dollar prize pool. For Season 7, Psyonix introduced South America as a new region. Season 8 took place in December 2019. The Season 9 championship was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with winners of the regional championships being considered the champions. In July 2020, Psyonix announced a new format for the tenth season of RLCS, known as RLCS X. This format league play in favor of teams earning points through three regional splits, all culminating in three seasonal majors.

Personal Life Preferring to be called Lois, she was the daughter of Arthur K. and Harriet Agnes (n√©e Whishaw) Bulley. Her father had become wealthy within his family's cotton brokerage business and later became a keen plant collector and started Bees Ltd seed company. She was born on 2 December 1901 at Mickwell Brow, a house built for her father near the village of Ness near the market town of Neston on the Wirral Peninsula, Cheshire. She had a brother Alfred Wishaw Bulley (born 1905). They were brought up as agnostics, despite the Congregationalist and Anglican backgrounds of their parents. After initially being educated at home by French and German governesses, she was sent to the co-educational Bedales School, Hampshire and then trained as a nurse and midwife at Queen Mary Maternity Hospital in Hampstead, qualifying in 1925. She worked initially in the east end of London. Although she was born into wealth, she became committed to the socialist principles of her parents and devoted much of her life to philanthropy and political activity through local government. She was an advocate for women's participation in civil society and inclusion at senior levels in business. She returned to Ness and became a member of the Management Committee of Neston and Parkgate Housing Society that aimed to replace slum housing with new, better quality, homes. She was also a member of Wirral Footpaths and Open Spaces Preservation Society. Her father died in 1942. In 1948 she was appointed to the Liverpool Regional Hospital Board and chaired the mental services committee, and then the board itself until 1972. In the same year she bought her brother's share of the family home and donated it and an endowment of ¬£75,000 to the University of Liverpool which has become Ness Botanic Gardens. This included provision for her mother to live in the house for the rest of her life, and that the gardens would be open to the public. She herself lived at Birch Hey in Ness Holt, sharing it with Ellen Norman. In 1954 she converted to Christianity, becoming a member of the Quakers. In 1956, after her mother's death, she set up a charitable trust (Motormart Charitable Trust) to benefit people in East Africa in part because some of her family's wealth originated from Africa, and also because there were several Quaker mission centres in the region. It helped fund schools and colleges, including one that has now become the Technical University of Kenya. It also supported other projects including supporting small businesses. In 1973 she decided that the trust should be wound up. There is still a Lois Bulley Scholarship Fund to support Kenyan women to attend university. She was a life-long tetotaller. In later life she was able to enjoy the theatres, concerts and galleries and particularly ballet in London where she, and a friend Mrs Nancy Kershaw Warden of the Heswall Meeting House, had a small flat. They also travelled around the UK, France, Spain and Germany in a campervan. After living in Chester they finally moved to Tarvin in Cheshire where Mrs Kershaw had a bungalow. She died there on 27 December 1995 at the age of 94. Political career She joined the Labour party in 1930. In 1933, she stood as Little Neston candidate in the Neston Urban District Council Election for the one available seat, and came second. However, she was elected in 1934 in the Cheshire County Council elections as a Labour councillor for the Ellesmere Port and Neston district. The proposals on which she stood included improved access to health care at the local Clatterbridge Hospital, welfare benefits through employing local men to construct roads and bridges and also disregarding war pensions and free school meals in the Means Test for benefits. She also advocated change in aspects of education, namely increasing the number of free secondary school places and providing milk and school meals. She was also successful in being elected as Little Neston councillor for the Neston Urban District Council in 1934. Although she lost both the district and county council seats in 1937, she returned to Cheshire County Council for the seat of Bebington, including New Ferry, in 1939. Her council roles included acting as vice-chair and Hon Secretary for the Committee of Chester and District Blind Welfare Society. In 1945 she was co-opted onto the housing committee of Neston Urban District Council. She was elected to the Neston East Ward of Neston Urban Council from 1957 - 1960. Her election allowed the Labour Party to have a majority in the council for the first time. In 1935 she stood as the Labour candidate for the parliamentary seat of Chester, coming third behind the Conservative and Liberal candidates. She supported the Labour party policies of nationalising the coal industry, raising the school leaving age to 15 and paying pensions from the age of 60. She joined the Communist party in 1936 because the Labour party and British government had policies of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. In 1945 she stood as a candidate for the parliamentary seat of Wirral but came second. Legacy Her family home and gardens, donated to the University of Liverpool as Ness Botanic Garden continues to be used for public recreation as well as horticultural education and scientific research.

It is named after Solomon W. Golomb, who constructed it (with a non- planar embedding) as a unit distance graph that requires four colors in any graph coloring. Thus, like the simpler Moser spindle, it provides a lower bound for the Hadwiger‚ÄìNelson problem: coloring the points of the Euclidean plane so that each unit line segment has differently-colored endpoints requires at least four colors. Construction 4-coloring of the Golomb graph, drawn as a unit distance graph The method of construction of the Golomb graph as a unit distance graph, by drawing an outer regular polygon connected to an inner twisted polygon or star polygon, has also been used for unit distance representations of the Petersen graph and of generalized Petersen graphs. As with the Moser spindle, the coordinates of the unit-distance embedding of the Golomb graph can be represented in the quadratic field \\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt{33}]. Fractional coloring The fractional chromatic number of the Golomb graph is 10/3. The fact that this number is at least this large follows from the fact that the graph has 10 vertices, at most three of which can be in any independent set. The fact that the number is at most this large follows from the fact that one can find 10 three-vertex independent sets, such that each vertex is in exactly three of these sets. This fractional chromatic number is less than the number 7/2 for the Moser spindle and less than the fractional chromatic number of the unit distance graph of the plane, which is bounded between 3.6190 and 4.3599.

It was built for the 1902 Hanoi Exhibition world trade fair, as the city became the capital of French Indochina. It was completely destroyed by airstrikes at the end of World War II. History Hanoi became the capital of French Indochina in 1902 replacing Saigon. Earlier activities to mark the change included a festival on 26 February 1902 attended by emperor Th√†nh Th√°i and the governor general Paul Doumer and the opening of the Paul Doumer Bridge (now Long Bi√™n Bridge). Paul Doumer also wanted to host a large-scaled world expo in Hanoi. The building was designed by Adolphe Bussy and was completed in 1902 prior to the fair, which lasted between November 1902 and February 1903. The high construction cost of the exhibition palace and the long duration of the fair left Hanoi's budget in deficit for a decade. After the fair, the complex became the Maurice Long Museum, the first and largest economics museum in French Indochina.

Slauerhoff. First published in 1933, and Slauerhoff's next-to-last volume, the poems in this collection center on Latin America and Portugal, and show a resignation or acquiescence not before seen in his poetry. Content The volume contains lyric poems, varying in length between 10 and 54 end-rhymed lines. Stanzas are between 2 and 6 lines long. The two-line stanzas are rhyming couplets; four-line stanzas frequently rhyme a b a b. The poems are organized in seven sections: #Tristas (three poems, one of which a translation of Rub√©n Dar√≠o's \\"El cantor va por todo el mundo\\" from his El canto errante, and another a poem on the Gran Chaco) #Islas (four poems on islands: Fogo, Fernando de Noronha, Fernando Po, and Isla Salas y G√≥mez) #Saudades (six poems, including fados and a long poem on Macao) #Zambas (two poems set in colonies in or near the Andes with an anti-colonial and anti-Christian tone) #Sonetas (three Italian sonnets, the first a translation of Ruben Dario's \\"Earthquake\\" from his \\"Nicaraguan Triptych\\") #Coplas (four four-line stanzas of trimeter, rhyming a b a b) #Desenganas (two short poems about sex, guilt, and desire) Publishing history The collection was to be called Saudades. First published in 1933 by A. A. M. Stols in Nijmegen in 15 hand-signed copies (according to Slauerhoff, 14 more than necessary). The second was the first trade edition, a revised edition with a number of poems excised, published in 1934. Following editions 1935, 1939, and 1940) were edited by Kees Lekkerkerker (and all published by Stols. Critical responses Menno ter Braak praised Soleares highly in a review later collected in his In gesprek met de onzen (1946). He identifies Slauerhoff's poetry's main theme as \\"the desperado, the person who feels like an outcast in a world he regards with a mixture of revulsion, desperate affection, and sarcasm\\" and remarks that with Slauerhoff this isn't a pose but an innate quality of the man. Compared to his earlier collections the quality of the poetry has increased, but not at the expense of personality. Ter Braak cites \\"Vida triste\\", in which the speaker reflects on a love affair and begs for a way to kill his hellish passion, and finds in it Slauerhoff's continuing displeasure with existence and his fatal exile. The volume was awarded the 1934 C.W. van der Hoogtprijs. Though Slauerhoff had been critical of the Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde, which awarded the prize, he did accept it, as a thank-you note written in Tangier on 2 July 1934.

He was a Gentleman of the Bedchamber of Charles X of France. Mission to North Africa In mid-October 1831 Louis Philippe I sent de Mornay on a mission to Abd al-Rahman of Morocco. His task was to negotiate a peace treaty and a border delimitation with the Alawite emperor. Following the French conquest of Algeria the mission needed to establish neighbourly relations between the two countries.Nabila Oulebsir, Les Usages du patrimoine: Monuments, mus√©es et politique coloniale en ..., p. 160 His mission had an immediate success: On April 4, 1832 he was able to send a letter declaring to the general-in-chief of the staff of Algiers, Anne Jean Marie Ren√© Savary, that Morocco would abandon its claims on the region of Tlemcen and Oran, promise to remain neutral and withdraw their troops from Algeria. At first Eug√®ne Isabey had been approached to join the diplomatic mission to North Africa. However, when the painter returned from Algiers he had declined, unwilling to make a second trip to Africa. It was therefore Eug√®ne Delacroix who had been chosen to accompany the mission, at his own expense. It was not until the end of 1831 that the painter and Mornay became acquainted, thanks to Henri Duponchel and , at the request of Mademoiselle Mars, Mornay's official mistress and a friend of both Duponchel and Bertin. She was keen to find a pleasant traveling companion for her lover. Mornay and Delacroix dined together on New Year's Eve, accompanied by the actress. In 1845 he was named a Peer of France.Christoph Otterbeck, Europa verlassen: K√ºnstlerreisen am Beginn des 20.

She showed very promising form as a juvenile in 2017 when she won her first three races before being narrowly beaten in the Golden Rod Stakes. In the following spring she took the Rachel Alexandra Stakes and the Ashland Stakes before winning the Kentucky Oaks, the filly equivalent of the Kentucky Derby. She followed this up with wins in the Acorn Stakes and Coaching Club American Oaks, but was disqualified to second for interference in the Cotillion Stakes. She then rebounded to win the Breeders' Cup Distaff while facing older horses for the first time. Monomoy Girl did not race at age four after suffering a bout of colic. So far in 2020, she has won her first two starts of the year, including the Ruffian Handicap. Background Monomoy Girl is a chestnut filly with a white star bred in Kentucky by FPF LLC & Highfield Ranch. As a yearling she was offered for sale at Keeneland in September 2016 and was bought for $100,000 by BSW Bloodstock/Liz Crow. She entered the ownership of a partnership made up of Michael Dubb, Sol Kumin's Monomoy Stables LLC, The Elkstone Group and Bethlehem Stables and was sent into training with Brad Cox. She was from the second crop of foals sired by Tapizar, best known for his win in the 2012 Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. Her dam Drumette showed limited racing ability but was descended from My Lady Love, a half-sister to the Kentucky Oaks Winner Heavenly Cause. Racing career =2017: Two-year-old season= Monomoy Girl began her racing her career with a three and three quarter length win in a maiden race over one mile on turf at Indiana Grand Race Course on September 5. Later that month at Churchill Downs, she followed up by taking an allowance race over one mile on turf. The filly made her first appearance on dirt in the Rags to Riches Stakes at Churchill Downs on October 29 and started the 3.4/1 favorite against nine opponents. Ridden by Florent Geroux, she took the lead soon after the start and drew way in the straight to win by six and a half lengths from Queen Mum. For her final start of the season, Monomoy Girl was stepped up to Grade II class for the Golden Rod Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at the same track four weeks later. She started the odds-on favorite but after leading for most of the way she was caught in the final strides and was beaten a neck by Road To Victory. =2018: Three-year-old season= Monomoy Girl began her three-year-old campaign in the Grade II Rachel Alexandra Stakes at Fair Grounds Race Course on February 17, 2018 and started the 9/10 favorite ahead of Wonder Gadot (winner of the Demoiselle Stakes) and Classy Act. After racing at the rear of the field in the early stages, the filly moved upon the outside, took the lead in the straight and won by two and a half lengths from Classy Act despite ducking to the right a furlong out. After the race Brad Cox said, \\"She proved herself today... You can see she's still a little bit of a funny filly to deal with, but she's learning and we're lucky to have her. Obviously the Kentucky Oaks is the goal\\". In the Grade I Ashland Stakes at Keeneland Race Course on April 7, Monomoy Girl started as odds-on favorite against six opponents and never looked in any danger of defeat. She took the lead from the start and drew away from the field in the last quarter mile to come home five and a half lengths clear of Eskimo Kisses. In the Kentucky Oaks on 4 May Monomoy Girl started second favorite behind the Santa Anita Oaks winner Midnight Bisou. Eskimo Kisses and Wonder Gadot were again in opposition while the best fancied of the other ten runners were Coach Rocks (Gulfstream Park Oaks), My Miss Lily (Gazelle Stakes) and Rayya (UAE Oaks). Geroux positioned the filly just behind the leaders before sending her to the front half a mile from the finish. In the stretch the race developed into a prolonged struggle between Monomoy Girl and Wonder Gadot, with the latter gaining the advantage approaching the final furlong before Monomoy Girl rallied in the final strides to win by half a length, despite hanging to the right. Wonder Gadot's jockey John Velasquez lodged an objection to the winner on the grounds of interference in the straight, but the result was allowed to stand. After the race Geroux said, \\"When I hit the quarter pole, her ears were flopping back and forth and she tried putting the brakes on me until she saw Wonder Gadot. When the other filly got head-to-head, I gave her a few slaps to keep her interested, but she can be quirky\\". Monomoy Girl at the 2018 Breeders' Cup Five weeks after her win at Churchill Downs, Monomoy Girl started odds-on favorite for the Grade I Acorn Stakes over one mile at Belmont Park. With Geroux again in the saddle, she won by two lengths from Talk Veuve To Me. \\"I just had a lot of confidence going into this race\\", said Cox, noting her growing maturity. \\"She never gets worked up. You can tell she's just kind of taking it all in. She does look around a lot. That's just her... Nothing really rattles her.\\" On July 22, Monomoy Girl earned her fourth Grade I win in a row in the Coaching Club American Oaks at a distance of miles at Belmont Park. She went off as the 1-2 favorite in a field of five that included Midnight Bisou, her chief rival in the three-year-old filly division. Monomoy Girl went to the early lead and set a sensible pace. Turning for home, Geroux urged her forward and Monomoy Girl responded by opening up down the stretch for a three length win. Monomoy Girl made her next start in the Cotillion Stakes on September 22 at Parx Racing, again facing off with Midnight Bisou. Monomoy Girl and Separationofpowers rated just behind the early pace set by Jump Ruler, while Midnight Bisou raced a few lengths further back in fifth. Swinging wide around the turn, Monomoy Girl moved to the front, opening up a length lead in midstretch despite drifting in towards the rail. Closing steadily down the stretch, Mike Smith on Midnight Bisou first guided his filly to the rail then moved her to the outside to get around Monomoy Girl. As the gap narrowed, Monomoy Girl started to drift again, this time moving out from the rail despite Geroux's attempts to keep her straight. The two fillies bumped near the finish line and Monomoy Girl crossed the finish line a neck in front. However, she was subsequently disqualified to second for interference. \\"If [Monomoy Girl] only came in the first time\\", commented Smith, \\"she probably wouldn't have gotten disqualified, but there were two different incidents. She'll do that, that mare. She'll lean into one. She's a fighter.\\" Monomoy Girl faced older fillies and mares for the first time in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, held on November 3 at Churchill Downs. The field included champion Abel Tasman (2017 Kentucky Oaks, 2018 Personal Ensign), Midnight Bisou, Blue Prize (Spinster Stakes), Vale Dori (Zenyatta Stakes), Wow Cat (Beldame Stakes) and Wonder Gadot (Queen's Plate). Breaking from the outside post, Monomoy Girl stalked the early pace set by Wonder Gadot then took command rounding the turn, then held off a late run from Wow Cat to win by a length. \\"She ran the way she was training\\", Cox said. \\"She was training like a monster, and she ran like a monster.\\" Monomoy Girl was named the champion three-year-old filly of 2018. She will be given a few months of rest before returning in 2019 for a four-year-old campaign. = 2019: Four-year-old season = Monomoy Girl's four year old season was postponed when she arrived at Churchill Downs by van from Fair Grounds with a mild case of colic at the end of March. She was sent to Rood and Riddle and, after several days, to WinStar Farm to recuperate. Originally, Cox hoped to have her back in his barn by the start of May; however Monomoy Girl remained at WinStar until July, eventually being put back into training at the farm. She returned to Cox's barn at Churchill Downs on July 14. She re-entered training in an attempt to defend her title in the Breeder's Cup Distaff, but then pulled a gluteal muscle in a workout on September 7, sidelining her again.

The British East India Company (EIC) apparently acquired her in 1775. Between 1779 she made eleven complete voyages as an East Indiaman for the EIC. She also participated in three naval campaigns, during the first of which she was deployed as a cruiser off Sumatra. There she engaged and captured a French ship. In the other two served as a transport. She set out for her twelfth EIC voyage but was lost in 1805 during the third naval campaign. Origins There is ambiguity concerning Britannias launch year. Reports include 1772, 1775, 1777, or 1778. The source of the 1772 year is a list that of vessels built at the Bombay Dockyard that shows her owner as Mr. Watson. The same list shows a Britannia being rebuilt in 1778. These are the only two mentions of a Britannia being built between 1736 and 1840.House (1840), p.609. Britannia was built of teak and her long life as an East Indiaman sailing between England and India and China demonstrated the both the utility of teak, and the skill in ship construction of Eastern shipyards. She was also one of only a handful of merchant ships that the EIC actually owned. (Almost without exception the EIC leased and chartered its merchant ships.) Career Britannias career before the EIC acquired her is obscure. Captain Newman Mallack sailed her from Bombay to Calcutta, where she arrived on 1 September 1779. On the 5th, Captain George Hutchinson of , his officers and crew, took over Britannia to sail her to England. (Stafford had been lost on the Hooghly River on 29 August.) =EIC voyage #1 (1779-1781)= Captain George Hutchinson was at Ingeli (a point on the west side of the Hooghli Estuary), on 18 November. From there he sailed Britannia to Bombay, South East Asia, China, and England. On 28 December she was at Cochin, on 1 January 1780 at Tellicherry, on 13 January at Onore, and on 27 January Bombay. She sailed up to Surat, where she arrived 5 February, and then on to Mangalore (15 February), Tellicherry again (9 May), and Madras (20 May). Britannia reached Malacca on 19 July and arrived at Whampoa anchorage on 5 September. Leaving for England, she crossed the Second Bar on 13 December, reached St Helena on 19 May 1781, and arrived at The Downs on 21 October. =EIC voyage #2 (1782-1783)= Captain Edward Cumming sailed from Portsmouth on 5 May 1782, bound for St Helena and Bencoolen. Britannia reached St Helena on 24 July and arrived at Bencoolen on 27 November. She cruised the coast of Sumatra between Pring (12 January 1783) and Pulau Pisang (11 February), both at the time pepper ports, before returning to Bencoolen on 7 March. Homeward bound, she reached St Helena on 12 July and arrived at The Downs on 6 October. =EIC voyage #3 (1784-1786)= Captain Cumming sailed from Portsmouth on 29 December 1784, bound for Madras and China. Britannia reached the Cape of Good Hope on 27 March and Madras on 28 May. She reached Malacca on 3 August and arrived at Whampoa on 15 September. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 2 January 1786, reached St Helena on 5 April, and arrived at The Downs on 24 June. =EIC voyage #4 (1787-1788)= Captain Cumming sailed from The Downs on 6 January 1787, bound for Bengal. Britannia was at Madeira on 18 January and the Cape on 3 April Cape; she arrived at Diamond Point on 11 June. Homeward bound, she was at Cox's Island on 14 January 1788. She reached St Helena on 25 April, and arrived at The Downs on 7 July. =EIC voyage #5 (1789-1790)= Captain Cumming sailed from Portsmouth on 11 February 1789, bound for St Helena and China. Britannia reached St Helena on 7 May and Batavia on 3 September. She arrived at Whampoa on 28 November. Homeward bound, she left Whampoa on 2 February 1790, reached St Helena on 30 May, and arrived at The Downs on 18 August. =EIC voyage #6 (1791-1792)= (6) 1790/1 Bombay and China. Captain Cumming sailed from Torbay on 2 February 1791, bound for Bombay and China. Britannia reached Bombay on 1 June and arrived at Whampoa on 22 September. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 14 November, reached St Helena on 25 February 1792, and arrived at The Downs on 22 April. =EIC voyage #7 (1793-1795)= By the time Britannia sailed again war with France had broken out. Captain Thomas Cheap, Jr. acquired two letters of marque, the first on 4 March 1793, and the second on 21 March. Captain Cheap sailed from Portsmouth on 5 April 1793, bound for Madras and Bengal. Britannia reached Madras on 14 August and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 8 September. In late 1793 John Shore, the EIC's Governor- General of India, formed a squadron from the company's own ships to patrol the Sea of Bengal and Southeast Asia. He diverted two East Indiamen, William Pitt and Britannia, and the country ship from their regular route for the service. A vessel of the Bombay Marine, possibly Viper, accompanied them. The reason for the move was the coming together of two problems, the inability of the British Royal Navy to maintain a presence in the area, and intelligence concerning the presence of French privateers and naval vessels in the area. The EIC appointed Captain Charles Mitchell, of William Pitt, Commodore of its squadron. Britannia set out on her naval mission and was at Sagar Island on 5 December. She reached Malacca on 29 December. On 21 January 1794 joined the squadron. The next day the squadron engaged two French privateers, Vengeur, of 34 guns and 250 men, and R√©solue, of 26 guns and 230 men. Britannia captured Vengeur, and Nonsuch captured R√©solue, with the French captains realising that further resistance would be pointless as William Pitt and Houghton came up. Eleven French sailors had been killed and 25 wounded; losses on R√©solue were heavy. British losses were one killed and two wounded on Britannia. Britannia continued her naval role for some months. After the engagement she sailed to Batavia, arriving on 26 January. She then visited Benkulen on 4 March, before returning to Batavia on 2 June. Captain Cheap died of an illness in June. Britannia sailed to Malacca (16 July), Penang (5 August), and Acheh (3 September). She ended her naval role and returned to Diamond Harbour on 25 September. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 29 November, reached St Helena on 18 March 1795m, and arrived at The Downs on 25 July. =West Indies expedition (1795‚Äì1796)= Captain Thomas Barrow acquired a letter of marque on 16 October 1795. In 1795 Admiral Hugh Cloberry Christian mounted and expedition to the West Indies. The EIC chartered 16 vessels to the British Government to augment the Navy Transport Board's own transports.Hardy (1800), p.225. The expedition sailed on 6 October, 16 November, and 9 December, but weather forced the vessels to put back.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ2790. Britannia sailed from Portsmouth on 29 January 1796, but had to put back. The fleet finally successfully sailed on 20 March to invade St Lucia, with troops under Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby. Britannia was at Barbados by 14 April, Martinique on 24 April, and St Lucia on 28 April. St Lucia surrendered to the British on 25 May. The British went on to capture Saint Vincent and Grenada. Britannia returned to Martinique on 5 June and was at Saint-Pierre, Martinique, on 13 June. She arrived back at The Downs on 8 August. =EIC voyage #8 (1797-1798)= Captain Barrow sailed from Plymouth on 22 February 1797, bound for St Helena, Madras, and Bengal. Britannia was at Saint Helena on 8 May St Helena and reached Madras on 1 August. She then cruised the coast, before returning to Madras on 30 September. She arrived at Diamond Harbour on 5 November. Homeward Bound, she was at Saugor on 13 March 1798, reached the Cape on 19 June and St Helena on 5 August, and arrived at The Downs on 25 October. =EIC voyage #9 (1799-1801)= Captain Barrow sailed from Portsmouth on 24 April 1799, bound for Madras, Bengal, Bombay, and China. Britannia reached Madras on 26 August and Vizagaptam on 2 October, and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 22 October. Continuing her voyage, she was at Saugor on 19 December, reached Colombo on 13 February 1800, and arrived at Bombay on 5 March. She left Bombay but soon returned on 18 September because she was overcrowded. Resuming her voyage, she was at Mangalore on 5 October, Cannanore on 13 October, and Tellicherry on 28 November; she arrived at Whampoa on 15 March 1801. Homeward bound, she was at the Bocca Tigris on 7 July, reached St Helena on 21 September, and arrived at The Downs on 2 December. =EIC voyage #10 (1802-1803)= Captain Barrow sailed from The Downs on 5 May 1802, bound for Madras. Britannia reached Madras on 1 September, left on 20 October, and four days later returned to Madras. She reached St Helena on 15 January 1803 and arrived at The Downs on 22 March. =EIC voyage #11 (1803-1805)= By the time Britannia sailed war with France had resumed. Captain Jonathan Birch acquired a letter of marque on 3 October 1803.The number of guns is high for a merchantman of 700 tons (bm), and the number of men is double what one would expect on a vessel twice her burthen. The reasons are currently unclear. He sailed from Portsmouth on 26 October, bound for St Helena and Madras. Britannia reached St Helena on 5 March 1804 and arrived at Madras on 5 October. Homeward bound, she reached St Helena on 31 December and arrived at The Downs on 19 March 1805. Fate Captain Birch sailed from Portsmouth on 27 July 1805, bound for Madras and Bengal on her twelfth voyage for the EIC. She was one of the EIC vessels that were part of the expedition under General Sir David Baird and Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham that would in 1806 capture the Dutch Cape Colony. They would carry supplies and troops to the Cape, and then continue on their voyages. Britannia was at Cork on 27 August and Madeira on 29 September. Britannia and King George wrecked on 1 November 1805 on Rocas Atoll at . sighted the danger at 3:30 a.m., and fired a gun, the signal to tack, herself barely missing the danger. King George was unable to tack and wrecked. As Britannia was on the point of tacking she ran afoul of and lost her bowsprit and foretopmast. She then drifted on to the atoll where she lost her rudder and bilged.Grocott (1998), pp.202-3. During the night Britannia was gotten off the rocks but took on so much water that she sank quickly,Theal (1899), p.252. having drifted some seven miles from where she struck. In the morning, before she sank, , , and sent their boats and were able to rescue about 400 people from Britannia, including Brisk, his crew, and recruits for the EIC's armies. Although the only cargo saved consisted of 12 chests of dollars (out of some 160), from Britannia, the only deaths were General Yorke and a soldier from King George and a seaman from Britannia.Theal (1899), pp.253-4. The EIC charged her cargo to the British government.Reports... (1830), Vol. 2, p.977/ Popham hired Varuna at St Salvador Bay to carry the survivors on.

Dam√°sio then started a campaign to attract new members to the club to overcome financial difficulties, raising the number of associates from 83,000 to 150,000. He also tried to lower the club's debt with Parmalat as a sponsor; however, it did not help much. Along with the help of Ab√≠lio Rodrigues and Gaspar Ramos, Dam√°sio transformed Benfica's football department. His choice of football coaches was not fortunate: he signed Artur Jorge, Paulo Autuori, and Manuel Jos√©, with M√°rio Wilson serving as interim coach, thrice. In terms of players, Dam√°sio spent a lot of money in failed signings, such as Nelo, Jos√© Tavares, Paulo Nunes, and Donizete, among over 100 signings.

This was a forced labor camp for Polish Jews during the war which eventually turned into an SS Concentration Camp until it was liquidated in 1944. There is no Nazi documentation that says the exact number of prisoners that were at the camp throughout the war or when it switched from a labor camp to a concentration camp, and testimonies of Jews in the camps are conflicting. Before the war Before the war, Mielec was a draw for economic activity because it was included in one of the biggest industrial regions in Poland called C.O.P (Central Industrial Region (Poland)). This brought a lot of people to the area, many of which were non-Jews. This created a competitive economic atmosphere which increased tensions between Jews and non-Jewish Poles, and Jews would often have their homes looted or the windows of their businesses or homes broken, creating an antisemitic attitude even before the war started. German invasion On September 1, 1939 Germany invaded Poland. By September 13 they had taken over Mielec, especially attracted to the aircraft factory, and by October 5 the conquest of Poland was complete. Once German leaders replaced the Polish authorities, the anti-Jewish discrimination in Mielec expanded, with more looting of Jewish stores and Jews being recruited to perform menial labor tasks like sweeping sidewalks and washing cars. In 1939, 30-40 Jews in Mielec were killed on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, after the Germans surrounded the Mikveh in which they were gathered and set it on fire. Those who tried to escape were shot and those who remained inside perished in the fire. By January, 1940, there were labor camps all over Poland. On March 9, 1942, the Jews in Mielec who had not already been transported to other labor camps were marched at gunpoint to the aircraft factory on the outskirts of the city where they were then impounded. Any sick, elderly, injured, weak or prominent figures were shot and buried in a mass grave. Life in the camp Jews in the Mielec labor camp faced brutal conditions. The camp was about two and a half acres of land surrounded by electrically charged barbed wire with a few wooden barracks to house the 1500 to 2000 prisoners that would be there at one time.Kowalski, Tadeusz. Obozy hitlerowskie w Polsce po≈Çudniowo ‚Äì wschodniej [Nazi camps in southeastern Poland]. Warszawa: Ksiazka i Wiedza, 1973. The labor camp was originally run by the Werkschutz, the Factory protection police, and their leader Gotthold Stein, but was later taken over by the Schutzstaffeln (SS) and supervised by their leader at the time, Gottlieb Hering. In the camp, prisoners would be woken up at 5 AM, and then work from 6 AM to 6 PM doing things like producing airplane parts, cleaning the factory, and loading and unloading cargo. For breakfast the prisoners got black coffee and seven ounces of bread, and for lunch and dinner they got a soup made of cabbage leaves and grub. This led to many dying from starvation or collapsing due to weakness and then being shot because of it. Another large cause of death in the camp was disease. There was a typhus epidemic in 1942 that affected hundreds of prisoners, and rather than being treated they were brought to the woods and shot by Germans. =The Ordungsdienst= One of the forces that controlled the camp was the J√ºdischer Ordnungsdienst or Jewish Police Service. While some members of this force were sympathetic with their Jewish counterparts, others were violent towards the prisoners because they wanted to be in good graces of the Germans and spare their own lives. Two members, Doctor Birm and Jacob Keimann, voluntarily chose which Jews were going to be executed daily.Chiel, L√∂w. Innsbruck, August 12, 1946. YVA M.38/411 (original in Dokumentationsarchiv des √ñsterreichschen Widerstandes [Documentation Archive of the Austrian Resistance]). ‚Äî .

Zentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltungen, Ludwigsburg, date unknown. Another member, Buciu Gotinger who was a kapo (prisoner functionary) regularly tortured and beat the prisoners, making them perform hard labor tasks until they couldn‚Äôt anymore, and then he would beat them with a wooden floorboard until they became unconscious. However, not all members of the Jewish Police Service in Mielec were violent toward other Jews. The first leader of the Ordungsdienst at the camp was named Bitkower, and he and his wife were well liked and respected by the prisoners. According to a testimony from one of the prisoners, Ajzik Leibovicz, Bitkower asked about his family and where he was from, and when he saw that Leibovicz was sick one night, Bitkower told him to go see his wife (who was a doctor) in the morning and get treated. He listened to Bitkower and the next morning Mrs. Bitkower treated him and gave him injections which was not common practice in the labor camps.Leibovicz, Ajzik. 1960s. Yad Vashem Archives (YVA) 0.3/10176. Concentration camp There is no Nazi documentation that says exactly when the camp changed from a labor camp to a concentration camp, but it may have been after Gottlieb Hering arrived in 1943 or when Josef Schwammberger arrived in February 1944. However, it is known that the camp had definitely transformed into a concentration camp by spring of 1944 because prisoners had started to have ‚ÄúKL‚Äù (Konzentrationslager) tattoos onto them. Liquidation and liberation There are conflicting testimonies from prisoners of when exactly the Mielec labor camp began to evacuate, but it is agreed upon that by August, 1944, most of the Jews had been sent to other camps, mainly to P≈Çasz√≥w, either directly or by way of Wieliczka salt mine. There is also a Polish book that says the camp was evacuated in July after an order from Amon G√∂th when the Red army had advanced within 50 miles of Mielec. The Jews were transported in overcrowded cargo wagons, many dying due to disease or hunger. In January 1945, when the Soviets were almost at Mielec, the remaining Jews at the camp were hastily evacuated to other camps, but because of the brutal winter conditions, many died on the way and those who survived were killed at their destination camps. By January 23, 1945, the Soviets had liberated Mielec.

She parlayed an inheritance from her first husband into a sizeable estate with her second husband. Upon the latter's death, she took over the business and successfully operated a shipping firm from 1781 to 1792 before living out her life in Bath. Hayley was born in 1728 in London to the prosperous distiller Israel Wilkes junior and was a sister to the politician John Wilkes. Kind-hearted but opinionated, she lived an unconventional life and was known for her astute observation and discussion, based upon her wide reading. Refusing to bow to custom, she attended trials at the Old Bailey and travelled throughout Britain to satisfy her wide-ranging curiosity. Marrying a widower, Samuel Storke junior, in 1752, she became a widow within the year with a young step-son. As her husband's sole heir, she inherited his business and soon after his death married his chief clerk, George Hayley. He turned out to be a shrewd businessman, increasing her inherited wealth tenfold during his lifetime. Their business established extensive trade relationships with the American colonies, supplying the tea which gained infamy in the Boston Tea Party. After her second husband's death and the end of the American Revolution, American merchants owed Hayley a large debt and she became one of the few Britons who successfully recouped their losses after the war. In 1784, she purchased a frigate used by both the Continental Navy and the Royal Navy and had it refurbished as a whaling and sealing vessel. She rechristened the frigate the United States and moved to Boston, where she lived for eight years. Unusually for women at the time, she became a benefactor, donating money and goods to charitable endeavours, and ran a whaling business. Her first venture, a voyage to the Falkland Islands, resulted in a shipment of whale oil, which was seized by the British government in 1785. She successfully recouped her losses from the Crown, as it was unable to prove that she owed duty, as British merchants were exempt if one-third of their crew was also British. In 1786, Hayley married a Scottish merchant in Boston, Patrick Jeffrey. In 1792, she left him and returned to England with the stipulation that he never again appear in her presence. After a brief stay in London, she lived out her days in Bath. Early life Mary Wilkes was born on 30 October 1728 in the Clerkenwell area of London, as the next to youngest child of Sarah Heaton and Israel Wilkes. Her mother was the daughter of a prosperous tanner and her father was a distiller. Her siblings, included Sarah (1721-1767), known as Sally, who was said to have been the inspiration for Charles Dickens‚Äô character Miss Havisham in Great Expectations. Among the others were Israel III (1722‚Äì1805); John (1725‚Äì1797) a prominent politician; Heaton (1727-1803) born 20 months before Mary; and Ann (1736‚Äì1750), who died from smallpox at the age of 14. Mary was known for her kind heart but also for her fiery outbursts and limited self-control, which may have been caused by severe headaches. Wilkes, who was widely read and enjoyed critical discussion, was known for her astute observation and sound judgment. She had little use for either religion or other women, preferring to surround herself with the company of eminent male writers and scholars. She had a reserved seat at the Old Bailey, where she attended trials. The court tried felony cases, those for which the death penalty could be imposed. Flaunting convention, she refused to withdraw with the other ladies when evidence or discussion was deemed unsuitable for women to hear. Her curiosity compelled her to travel widely in Britain each summer in order to improve her knowledge. Though used to living in luxury, she was interested in \\"manufactories, manners, high and low, and worse than low\\", desiring to \\"see everybody and everything\\". Politically, Wilkes was an ally of her brother, John, and supported both civil liberties and curtailment of the Crown's power. As such, she supported the rights of the American colonies and was acquainted with a wide range of prominent American figures. Married life Great Ayliff Street on Goodman's Fields, London On 18 June 1752, she married Samuel Storke junior who had inherited from his father Samuel one of the leading London trading firms doing business with New England and the British West Indies. Storke had previously been married to a Miss Jones, and had a two-year-old son, Richard (1751‚Äì1767). Within a year of the marriage he died, leaving her an inheritance of ¬£15,000, as well as a life interest in his former wife's estates in Monmouthshire and Gloucestershire. Soon after being widowed, Storke married the former clerk and negotiator in her husband's office, George Hayley. Upon their marriage, Mary Hayley's inheritance became her new husband's property and he entered into a business arrangement with Storke's former business associate, Alexander Champion. George had been apprenticed to Storke and with the marriage rose from \\"rags to riches\\". While her husband ran the businesses, Hayley continued to indulge her interests in intellectual conversation, attending trials, travelling widely and going to the theatre. She enjoyed racing around London in her coach at breakneck speeds. In addition to their home in London's Great Ayliff Street, the couple had a residence in Bromley. Dinah, Hayley's only child, later Lady Baker In 1759, she gave birth to her only surviving child, a daughter, Dinah, with whom she would have a tempestuous relationship. Two sons and a daughter born to the Hayleys died in infancy. George Hayley used his wife's money well, becoming one of the wealthiest merchants in London, one time president of Lloyd's of London, and a member of the House of Commons from 1774 to 1781. Mary Hayley brought her husband into the social and political circle of her brother John, and though George was taciturn in public and in their private life, he was aggressive in his business dealings. He operated at 9 Laurence Pountney Lane, as George Hayley and at 18 Great Ayliff (now Alie) Street on Goodman's Fields, he operated as both Hayley and Rotch and as Hayley and Hopkins. The firm was involved in the importation of whale oil from the American Colonies and had extensive business dealings with the New Bedford and Nantucket Rotch family, becoming a business partner of Francis Rotch in operating the Falkland Fleet. Rotch and Hayley owned several ships together, including the Abigail, the America, and the Egmont. Hayley also owned a ship with John Hancock, which was used to transport tea to the colonies. In addition, Hayley acted as a broker and agent for other cargo on ships owned by Hancock and Rotch. As such, when Rotch's ship the Dartmouth delivered a shipment of whale oil to London in 1773, it was Hayley who arranged for tea to be loaded for the return voyage. That ship became one of the vessels involved in the Boston Tea Party. The Boston Tea Party as shown in Britain Since the governor of Massachusetts closed Boston Harbor as a result of the rebellion, Rotch and Hayley, along with Alexander, Benjamin and Richard Champion; Thomas Dickason; Samuel and Samuel Enderby junior; and John St Barbe formed the British Southern Whale Fishery, also known as the South Sea Whale Fishery. In 1775, Rotch assembled the Falklands Fleet, containing 16 or 17 ships in order to establish a whaling base in the Falkland Islands. Rotch negotiated with Hayley to market the whale oil and after travelling to London to secure government protection of their ships and crew from seizure, joined the fleet off the coast of Brazil. He returned to London with the fleet in 1777. As a Quaker and a pacifist, Rotch did not participate in the American Revolution which had just begun. He became Hayley's chief clerk and a permanent houseguest in the Hayley home. In America In 1781, George Hayley died and Mary took over the business, writing letters to his former business associates to assure them her firm would continue to serve them. Rotch served as her business advisor, personal companion, and they became betrothed. Hayley proved to be an astute businesswoman and by routing her funds from America, through neutral banks in France, was able to reclaim a large portion of her nearly ¬£100,000 left from George's investments. Three years after George's death, the strained relationship between Hayley and her daughter erupted over settlement of George's will. In 1783, Dinah had married a captain of the Devon Militia, Robert Baker, whom Hayley considered a fortune-hunter because he was deeply in debt. To escape his creditors, he had taken Dinah to Saint-Omer, France, and filed suit to collect Dinah's inheritance from Hayley. After arriving in Boston and hearing of the impending birth of her first grandchild, Hayley sent money to the couple and a conciliatory note. Upon the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War, Hayley and Rotch made a plan to sail for the United States to attempt to collect around ¬£20,000 still owed to her. Hayley wrote to her business partners informing them that she was leaving Alexander Champion, junior in charge of her affairs in London for the duration of her sojourn abroad. She purchased a frigate known as the Delaware which had been built in Philadelphia in 1776, but was captured by the British during the Chesapeake Bay blockade and after the war was sold by the British Navy. They sailed from Falmouth in April, arriving in Boston within 37 days on the ship which had been rechristened the United States. Hayley, who may have accepted an offer to stay with Dorothy Quincy and her husband John Hancock when she arrived, took up residence in Boston, leasing a house and fitting it out with a collection of American furniture and artworks. She also purchased a summerhouse in Providence. She was quick to pursue relationships with her business partners and gain a favourable reputation with Boston's elite through efforts such as giving Hancock a new coach. In October 1784, she hosted a fireworks display to commemorate the third anniversary of the surrender at Yorktown by Cornwallis. Hayley spent her first Christmas in America with Catharine Macaulay, Nathanael Greene, Lafayette and George Washington, first visiting Washington's Mount Vernon estate in Virginia and then accompanying the party to New England. Unusual for a woman at the time, Hayley also became a benefactor to the poor and contributed to numerous charitable endeavours, including providing funds to care for both veterans of the war and widows; wood for the poor; blankets for prisoners; and donating money to a Charlestown meeting house and to a fund financing improvements of Boston Common. She also was one of the founders of the Massachusetts Humane Society, which was organised to save drowning victims. By July 1785, she had successfully recovered all debts owed to her. Meanwhile, the United States sailed on to Nantucket, where it was outfitted for sealing. Rotch engaged a crew and the ship sailed under Captain Benjamin Hussey to the Falklands by the end of 1784. Completing its fishing, the United States returned to London in 1785, but upon its arrival the cargo was seized over a dispute on the duty. Hayley claimed no duty was due as she was a British subject and owned the boat and at least one- third of the crew were British subjects. A trial ensued and finally in 1786, the Crown lost its case and was obligated to pay Hayley ¬£4,000 damages. In 1786, Rotch and Hayley parted ways. He had gone to England in 1785 and went on to France to develop business interests there. Hayley remained in Boston and on 14 June 1786, married Patrick J. Jeffrey, (c. 1748‚Äì1812) a Scotsman and the uncle of Francis Jeffrey (later Lord Jeffrey) . Patrick was in America to collect debts owed to a British creditor. Gossip about her appearance and whether he had married her for her money began to appear in the press around the same time as she married Patrick Jeffrey, who was nearly thirty years her junior, but in the beginning of their relationship they appeared devoted. Jeffrey, as she was now styled, continued to enjoy travel and went on numerous excursions throughout the US with Catharine Macaulay. Jeffrey sold the United States to DeBauque Brothers in late 1786. In 1791, Patrick, who was now the partner of Joseph Russell junior in a Boston mercantile firm, sailed to Madeira for his health. He returned in May 1792 and within six months, Jeffrey would sail for England without him. Return to England Jeffrey returned briefly to London and then retired to Bath, where she lived in a fashionable style in her home on Gay Street. She did not divorce her husband, which would have required an act of parliament, but they lived apart. One story says she agreed to pay him ¬£10,000 if he would never set foot in England during her lifetime. Another reports that Patrick Jeffrey gave her an allowance while he remained in Boston living off her money like a king in the mansion of the former royal governor, Thomas Hutchinson. Jeffrey's only child, Lady Dinah died in 1805, leaving six children, and her obituary omits any mention of her mother. One of these grandchildren was Sir Henry Baker, 2nd Baronet, who served in the Royal Navy in the War of 1812. Death and legacy Jeffrey died on 9 May 1808 at her home in Bath. Though her story would go largely unknown, she was one of the few women engaged in trade between Britain and the American colonies, as well as the burgeoning United States. At the end of the American Revolution, British merchants were owed between ¬£2,500,000 and ¬£5,000,000 depending on the interest due for the duration of the war. Lacking a federal mechanism, most British creditors had to engage with different state governments, limiting their ability to collect. Jeffrey was one of the few creditors who managed to recoup their losses in the immediate post-war period.

She was posthumously declared a Hero of the Soviet Union on 8 May 1965, over twenty years after her death in the war.  Civilian life  Sosnina was born on 30 November 1923 to a Russian family. Ivan Sosnin, her father, who was born in Siberia, was a doctor who had gone to medical school in Kiev after traveling to Australia, France, and Italy over a span of two years. He married a nurse by the name of Larissa Kondratyuk after graduating medical school and the couple soon moved to Kukhari village to assist in fighting a typhoid epidemic in the village. After Nina's younger brother Valentin was born there in 1926 the couple soon moved to the nearby Teterev village to establish a small hospital. When her father's health worsened he brought the family to his hometown Malyn, where Nina graduated from secondary school in the summer of 1941. She had joined the Komsomol in 1937.  Partisan activities  After Senior Lieutenant of the Red Army by the name of Pavel Taraskin escaped from the prisoner-of-war camp that he was held in, he was appointed to be the leader of the Malyn underground District Party Committee and Sosnia was made secretary of the District Komsomol Committee. Taraskin ordered five resistance cells to be formed, and only the leader of a cell would be able to directly contact him. Sosnina created one underground resistance cell based in Malyn and helped form cells in other villages in her district. The Sosnin family home became a headquarters for resistance activities in the area; it was where the partisans delivered the leaflets they produced and where they meticulously created a map of Axis defenses in the area. Eventually the partisans managed to obtain weapons and explosives after convincing Slovak guards of the storage facilities to help the resistance, as many of the guards had been patients of Nina'a father. As a doctor Ivan Sosnin forged health certificates to exempt several resistance members from forced labour. Not long after using the explosives they gathered to destroy a German locomotive, Taraskin was executed by the Germans on 22 January 1943. After Taraskin's death it was decided that Sosnina would be the new partisan leader, and the units continued their usual leaflet-spreading, re-supply, sabotage, and reconnaissance operations. She became skilled in the use of a variety of weapons including grenades and machine guns. Using her contacts with a Ukrainian fighting in the Hungarian Army she managed to ambush Axis punitive detachments that were sent to capture the partisans. Even after the Commissar of the partisan groups offered her a promotion to becoming the Komosomol organizer in his unit she denied the offer in order to stay in Malyn, as her unit was planning an upcoming attack on an Axis garrison. While helping an injured machine gunner by the name of Fedor Zichenko she took over his role as gunner to provide cover for his fellow soldiers. After his arm developed gangrene, requiring amputation, in the village of Pirishki, he was sent to the house of a schoolteacher who was sympathetic to the partisans, where Dr. Sosnin would soon arrive to operate; Nina accompanied him. However, a truckload of German soldiers encircled the house only an hour later and a standoff ensued, with Nina firing a machine gun and throwing grenades out the window. The teacher, knowing she would be executed for sheltering partisans, killed herself immediately. Another Soviet prisoner-of-war that was staying in the house jumped out a window and was captured by the German police Eventually the German soldiers lit the entire house on fire with the rest of the resistance members still inside. Larissa and Valentin, who were not at the teacher's house, were arrested by the Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp, but both managed to escape and lived to see the end of the war. Nina was soon nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union but the nomination was initially rejected because several people from her partisan group had family members who were arrested during the Great Purge. She was belatedly awarded the title in 1965 after the rehabilitation of many people arrested during the Great Purge led to the revaluation of her nomination, after which various monuments and memorials were constructed in her honor.
