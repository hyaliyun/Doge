Plot Brian Foster (Wesley Eure), a young inventor, creates a robotic dog for use as part of a home protection system. C.H.O.M.P.S. is an acronym for \\"Canine HOMe Protection System\\". Ralph Norton (Conrad Bain) is his boss, with whom he constantly argues. Foster develops a relationship with Norton's daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli). A rival company wants the dog and sends a few petty criminals to dognap \\"C.H.O.M.P.S.\\" Cast * Wesley Eure as Brian Foster * Valerie Bertinelli as Casey Norton * Conrad Bain as Ralph Norton * Chuck McCann as Brooks * Red Buttons as Bracken * Jim Backus as Mr. Gibbs Production Joseph Barbera approached his friend Samuel Z. Arkoff of American International Pictures about his company collaborating with Hanna- Barbera on live-action films. Though William Hanna and other members of Hanna- Barbera were not eager to venture beyond the animation field, according to Barbera, Arkoff was enthusiastic about the ideas that Barbera presented, and agreed in November 1975 to make four films together. Barbera's first idea was for a film about a super-canine, robotic Doberman pinscher guard dog which would capitalize on several ideas popular at the time. Filming started in and around Los Angeles in May 1978, 2¬Ω years after the collaboration was announced and was Hanna-Barbera's first live-action feature film. Barbera recalled that Arkoff's son Louis suggested that rather than a Doberman, the dog would have to be a non-threatening dog in the Benji mold. Barbera attributes this change in focus in the story to the film's lackluster performance at the box office. In his autobiography, Barbera wrote that the film \\"did okay... but it never made the splash it should have.\\" Because of this, the future film deals between Hanna-Barbera and AIP were canceled. Burt Topper worked on the movie as producer with Barbera, with Arkoff as executive producer. Release A PG- rated version of C.H.O.M.P.S. was shown for a short time during the summer of 1979. The stricter rating was due to some language employed by a dog‚Äînot the title character. It was edited, with the canine profanity overdubbed, in order to receive a G-rating and released during the Christmas season. This version was released in Los Angeles on December 21, 1979. Critical reception On the film's release, Variety wrote, \\"although it features a cute canine hero, a pair of do-gooding young people and a bevy of silly-minded adults, pic has little of the action or charm that lure audiences.\\" The review noted that director Don Chaffey \\"has done what he can to keep the pic moving given what he has to work with.\\" Of the performers, Variety judged, \\"Actors are uniformly okay but there's really only one star in this picture, 'Chomps.' Benji he's not.\\" Judging the film to be \\"unpretentious but slightly dismal in its execution\\", the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"The premise is engaging enough to entertain dog lovers and kids for awhile, but the screenplay... is mediocre television sitcom fare and too thin to sustain an entire movie.\\" Merchandising Scholastic Corporation released a 121-page book version of the film's story at the time of the film's first release. Home media MGM Home Entertainment (part of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the successor-in-interest to AIP) released C.H.O.M.P.S in DVD format on April 12, 2005.

The station is located in the neighbourhood of the same name, in the district of Bego√±a. It opened in 1997. Until 2019 it was a connecting station, also serving the regional services of Euskotren Trena coming from Durango, Bermeo and Donostia. These lines were diverted towards Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo station starting in 2017 with the first line and finally ending in 2019, completely bypassing Bolueta.  Station layout  Bolueta is an elevated station, with two platforms located above a main entry hall. The station can be accessed from Otxarkoaga and Ibarsusi streets. In 2012 a new access was opened from Telleria street, including an elevator for people with restricted mobility.  Access  * 20px Otxarkoaga Rd. * 20px Ibarsusi Rd., 1 * 20px 20px Santa Ana, Telleria St., 1 (access only to Metro platforms) * 20px 20px Station main hall, includes elevators to Euskotren Trena platforms  Services   Metro services   Bus services  In close proximity to the station there are bus stops for Bilbobus line 30 running to Bego√±a, Abando and Ibaiondo as well as several Bizkaibus lines running to Galdakao and Leioa (A2610), Ugao- Miraballes (A3613), Basauri and Zaratamo (A3622) and Artea (A3928).  Former services  When the station was opened in 1997, the station served as the only connection between the Metro Bilbao network and the Euskotren Trena lines to the cities of Bermeo, Durango, Eibar and San Sebasti√°n. All the Euskotren Trena lines that had Bilbao-Atxuri station as a terminus stopped at Bolueta, including the former lines 1, 1D and 3, with a train every 30 minutes in either direction.Old Euskotren Schedules (Official Website) After the opening of Metro Bilbao's Line 3, operated by Euskotren Trena, the trains coming from all destinations except Bermeo were rerouted through the new underground route that connects directly with Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo station in central Bilbao, bypassing Bolueta and Atxuri stations completely.  Future  After the opening of the Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo station for Euskotren Trena, most commuter trains coming from inner Biscay and Gipuzkoa were diverted toward the newer, more centric station, in consequence leaving Bolueta station with little commuter rail traffic. While the original operational plan for Euskotren Trena involved the diversion of all E4 trains coming from Gernika and Bermeo to the new station in early 2018, the changes were delayed at least until 2019 to avoid leaving the commuter rail section of the station without any services, which in turn would also affect Bilbao-Atxuri station. The Basque Government and the administration of the rail network, Euskal Trenbide Sarea (ETS), announced in 2003 the intention of transforming the rail road section between Bilbao-Atxuri, Bolueta and Etxebarri into a tramway line, thus continuing the existing Bilbao tramway service which currently has its terminus at Bilbao-Atxuri, however not many actions have been taken towards this objective. In early 2017 the plan was brought back by the administration and some studies were conducted In November 2018 it was announced by the Basque Government that the works to transform the lower level of Bolueta station into a tram stop while maintaining the connection with Metro Bilbao would start in 2019. It is expected to be finished in 2021.

He married Frances Parker, the daughter of Sir Henry Parker, 2nd Baronet MP of Honington, Warwickshire by licence dated 28 August 1691. Pakington was known for his Tory and High Church views. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Worcestershire at the 1690 general election, but did not stand in 1695. He was returned for Worcestershire in contests at the 1698 general election, the two general elections of 1701 and the 1702 English general election. Also in 1702 he was returned as MP for Aylesbury, but opted to sit for Worcestershire.

(Not to be confused with another UK-based band of the same name) They are known for creating predominately instrumental music that defies solid genre categorization. The tag \\"cinematic\\" stemmed from listeners' and critics' references to how the music fits to visual stimuli and thematic imagery from films. The band has also been referred to as crossover progressive, ambient, jam-band and even jazz-rock. Mandrake Project's eclectic music is accented by its shared membership with groups like The Polyphonic Spree, The Twilight Singers, New Invisible Joy and The Afghan Whigs. History 2001-2005 The band unofficially began in late 2001 as the by-product of a nameless experiment involving key members of popular Pittsburgh-based groups of the time. The experiment was short-lived with the first proper group forming around bandleader Kirk Salopek in late summer of 2002. Lacking a vocalist or conventional lineup, the band created an instrumental act with members revolving on each other's roles and instruments. Songs were built from rhythms and repetitive motifs, based on the core instrumentation of 2 guitars, 2 drummers, and a Chapman Stick. The result was jagged, heavily rhythmic and sometimes complicated compositions, evoking echoes of bands like King Crimson, Slint, and Led Zeppelin. The band recorded three unreleased demos between 2002 and 2005. In 2005, just prior to the recording of the last demo (dubbed the Grand Theatre Session) A significant lineup change occurred as drummer/bassist Anthony Pecora joined the full-time roster. This addition eliminated the need for the Chapman Stick to be the only melodic bass instrument and also added the possibility of a third drummer. Violinist Justin Greenwald also joined during its production, ushering a dramatic change in writing style for the band. This final demo recording exhibited a new-found penchant for juxtaposing electro/ambient soundscapes with aggressive rock numbers and long-winded free form improvisation, which would become the band's primary modus operandi. 2006 A Favor to the Muse was entirely self-produced and independently released on the band's own Overneath Records in October 2006. The album contained influences from minimalist composers like Steve Reich and Philip Glass to neo-Arabic ragas to sci-fi themes and noir jazz in the style of Angelo Badalamenti. The album boasted a guest list of 16 musicians beyond the core members, in addition to a 40-piece girl's choir included on the \\"indie- symphonic\\" track \\"An Ode to the Spaceman.\\" The song was included on the soundtrack to the independent film, Cure for the Crash, by Brian Paul Higgins. The movie, a docu-drama of sorts, explores the hobo/train-hopping culture in America during the Hurricane Katrina disaster. It has appeared at various major film festivals and won Best Feature Film at the Seattle Truly Indie Film Fest in 2010. 2007-2008 In November 2007, Mandrake Project began the recording of their second album and first \\"official\\" label release, \\"A Miraculous Container.\\" The collection of songs for the album was recorded over a period of about 10 months and was finally released in stores on March 24, 2009. Through a bizarre turn of events, the band ended up signing a contract with Swedish label Blistering Records, who deal primarily with hard rock and metal acts. Like A Favor to the Muse, A Miraculous Container would also host a cadre of guests including a vocalist, former New Invisible Joy singer John Schisler, which broke prior tradition of the band's normal repertoire. He assisted with lyrics on two vocal tracks, \\"Movement\\" and \\"Through Lights,\\" and arranged the Salopek-penned lyrics to the album's title track. 2009-2011 Despite the often confusing representation between the band and label, the album garnered critical praise in the months after its release in both press and AAA radio. In February 2009, a pre-release copy of \\"A Miraculous Container\\" caught the ear of John Diliberto, host of the nationally syndicated radio program Echoes. The album appeared on the show's Top 25 in June 2009 with artists such as Moby, Bill Frisell, Robin Guthrie and Leo Abrahams, peaking at #2 in August and earning a spot on the overall Top 25 for 2009. This eventually let to an invitation to perform live for an installment of the show's acclaimed Livingroom Concert Series. One of the live tracks recorded during the concert, \\"Beauxsong\\" was included on the 15th Anniversary Echoes Livingroom Concert Series CD, Still Echoes, alongside artists as diverse as Yo-Yo Ma, Pat Metheny, Air, Al Di Meola and Brian Eno. In addition, Mandrake Project was added to both John Diliberto's Top 10 CD's and Songs lists for 2009, ranking #9 for Best Album with A Miraculous Container and #7 for Best Song with \\"And Five Makes Twenty.\\" Jean-Phillipe Haas, French webzine critic at Chromatique.net listed A Miraculous Container as his pick for the #1 album in 2009. Several other US & European music webzines and press offered positive reviews of the record as well in the months after its release. The songs \\"And 5 Makes 20\\" & \\"LaLuna\\" were both used exclusively to score the short film \\"Pluck\\", by acclaimed British stage director Dan Jemmett. Throughout 2010 Mandrake Project worked on a number of songs for a follow-up EP to \\"A Miraculous Container\\", but a chance meeting with Porcupine Tree's, Steven Wilson led the band to Rob Palmen and his fledgling label Glassville Records. The label hosts other acts like Paatos, Riverside & Sun Domingo. At the suggestion of Palmen, the band continued work past 6 songs and released their third full-length record, \\"Transitions\\" in July 2011. 2011-Beyond Mandrake Project all but disappeared from live performance within a year after the release of Transitions. Kirk Salopek split off to form the David Lynch/Angelo Badalamenti tribute act Silencio with drummer David Jamison. Rick Nelson joined The Afghan Whigs for their 2012-13 reunion tour and started Marigny Recording Studio in New Orleans. Bassist Pecora started the experimental collective When The Planets.

He owned Aalholm Castle on Lolland as well as the Lindencrone Mansion in Copenhagen. Early life Frederik Christian Raben was born at Aalholm Castle in 1769 as the son of Otto Ludvig Raben, 2nd Count of Christiansholm. He graduated in law from the University of Copenhagen in 1788 and inherited the family estate when he was 21 years old.  Travels  F. C. Raben was the owner of the estate Christiansholm (now \\"√Ölholm\\") on Lolland and amateur botanist. He travelled in Europe and, unusual for his time, to Greenland and Brazil (1835-1838). He collected many plant specimens during his journey to Brazil. More than 1100 of his herbarium specimens now belong to the Botanical Museum at the University of Copenhagen.  Raben's great auk  Raben brought a specimen of the now extinct great auk back from Iceland in 1821. In 1968, a descendant of his, Baron Raben-Levetzau to √Ölholm, put it on auction at Sotheby's in London. The highest bid - ¬£ 9,000 - was given by Finnur Gudmunsson, then director of the Icelandic Natural History Museum. This is the highest price ever paid for a zoological specimen.  Legacy  A number of plant species have been named in his honour, particularly based on his own Brazilian collections, e.g. Miconia rabenii (Melastomaceae), Eleocharis rabenii (Cyperaceae) and Campomanesia rabeniana (Myrtaceae).

The son of Ukrainian immigrants, he was born in a small coal mining village in western Pennsylvania. After a short stint working in the coal mines, he attended the Pennsylvania State Police Academy at Hershey, PA, and started his career as a state trooper in 1937. He was appointed Commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police in 1967, and in 1971 became the Chief of the Federal Protective Service. He retired due to illness. McKetta developed a strong interest in fighting police corruption, racketeering, and influence peddling and became a speaker on the lecture circuit. His book, Police, politics, corruption: the mixture dangerous to freedom and justice, was released in 2000.Frank McKetta. Police, politics, corruption: the mixture dangerous to freedom and justice. West Virginia: Mcclain Printing Co 2000 . Family history The history of the McKetta family starts in the small town of Koroschenko, which means \\"pretty little village\\". This was located in the western edge of Ukraine and was the home of many unrelated families with the common name of Mukema (in Cyrillic). Within these families was a man named Wassail I, \\"Charles\\", Mukema. At the age of sixteen he joined Franz Joseph's Army. During his service, his section was captured and he was held in captivity for seven years. While in captivity, his betrothed, Catherine Melynk remained faithful, even though she had received no information about the status of Wassail. When she finally decided to marry someone else, Wassail arrived on the eve of her marriage in 1851. After he was identified, the wedding was canceled and the two were reunited in marriage. For his services in the Army, the country of Ukraine awarded the family with of land. After starting a life together, the two had one son, Wassail II, born in 1845. After the death of the late Wassail, the son inherited the land from his father. In order to pay for his partying and drinking, he sold all but acres of the land. On this land, Wassail II married Anna Mchnyk with whom he had three sons, John (born 1889), Frank (born 1891), and Steve (born 1894). After his wife died, he remarried a young girl and had two daughters, Katherine and Bertha. The boys took care of the farm land, and neither the boys nor the girls received any type of schooling because Ukraine did not have any elementary schools in this area during the early 1900s.History of the Mckettas and the Gelets In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the American steel companies looked to Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe to offer men jobs along with a free passage to America and $25 cash. In 1903 the eldest son, John, was only fourteen years old. While lying about his age when applying, he was fortunate to be invited to America. In January 1904, he started his journey to the United States and sent $20 of his $25 to his father back home. After a long journey, John docked in Baltimore. When filling out paper work at the immigration desk he was asked his name. As a result of no former education, he did not know how to spell his name and his last name was in Cyrillic, which has no spelling (it is only phonetic). With John's pronunciation, the immigration officer gave him the spelling of \\"McKetta\\". From Baltimore he was sent to Wyano, Pennsylvania where he began work in the coal mine six days a week. After four years of labor he had saved enough money to send for his brother Frank and another two years later for Steve.

Although they owned their own home, Frank McKetta and his family struggled during the Great Depression, when tragedy struck in 1936 with the death of Frank's father in a mining accident. His mother was left alone to raise the family during this economic struggle. The family survived with the help of a cow that was kept in a shed along with a pig and some chickens. They all helped keeping up a garden and during Frank's younger years, they had no outside form of income. Frank McKetta was lucky to be a part of a family in which all of the children received high school education at this time in history. He attended South Huntingdon High School which is now known as Yough High School. After high school only one of his sisters went to college. Frank McKetta chose to work along with family members at the McKetta Coal Company until he saved enough money to enter into the police academy. After saving enough money, he entered the Police Academy in Hershey, Pennsylvania on September 1, 1937. His career as a trooper started when he was first assigned in Luzerne County, where he was able to see first-hand the signs of corruption in the law enforcement. He later attended Indiana University, in Bloomington, Indiana, to take a summer course in 1963 on Advanced Police Management.McKetta 61.\\"Acting Deputy Frank McKetta Selected as New Commissioner of Police by Governor Shafer.\\" Communicator. Jan. 1967: Vol. 5 Num. 1. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Manual, Cabinet Level Agencies. Harrisburg, PA, 2008. volume 116:4, pp. 4‚Äì79, 4-80. Early law enforcement career First assignment and police corruption McKetta's first assignment set the tone of his career. He was asked to accompany a senior trooper at a local police force raid on a well-known gambling den. He was cautioned when attempting to arrest anyone by his supervisor. Once entering the den they found just a penny-ante poker game in the back room. They found no hard evidence, large sums of money, or big name racketeers. A Racket deals with organized crime. While McKetta was new, he assumed that his effort was a small part of a larger number raids taking place elsewhere but soon found out that this was not the case. The newspaper the next day distorted the facts and made it seem as if the local police force was helped by the state police in fighting against organized crime. McKetta discussed this with older troopers who did not agree with the system, but said they recently decided to follow orders and did not have input on the fight against organized crime. McKetta did not like how things were working and would later realize that this problem would bother him for the remainder of his career. It was hard for him to come to the realization that the \\"famed state police noted for legendary exploits in fighting the forces of evil was mostly a myth and that his chosen field of endeavor was in reality the tool of politicians.\\" McKetta 43 Throughout the next several years, McKetta had found nothing but more disappointing facts about the state police. There was a strict \\"home rule\\" policy placed on the state police jurisdiction. This prohibited outside troopers from going into any community during the investigation of other crimes and simply tried to keep the state police out. While he searched for answers and some reasoning, his attitude was considered a subtle form of insubordination and was labeled a \\"radical\\" and a \\"misfit\\", but an idealist by his own friends. His attitude was the reasoning that he was transferred frequently and had many assignment changes.McKetta 42-44. Reassigned as a detective Things did not change during the fifties when McKetta was stationed as a detective assigned to the Greensburg, Pennsylvania troop headquarters. He had stated that he recalled idly sitting by as a city police cruiser drove around as a well known numbers writer to pick up his cash and number slips. He was powerless because of the Governor's home rule policy and their own orders from their supervisors prohibited them from doing anything about the organized crime. McKetta was also assigned as a detective in western Pennsylvania under Governor Fine, Commissioner Wilhelm, and Squadron One Commander Major Andrew J. Hudock. McKetta was called to assist the Westmoreland County detectives on a raid. The directions of the raid led them to a house outside of Monessen. There were no lights on and no activity inside, which was abnormal because it was a house of prostitution on a Saturday night. Because Frank was previously stationed in Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania, which covered the similar area, he advised the others of another whorehouse on the other side of Monessen. A few of the men pretended to not hear this comment and stated something about being within city limits and outside of their designated land. A couple other men decided to take the lead and found the girls inside the other building. The girls were placed under arrest and their work was done by midnight. Upon returning to the Greensburg office, they noticed the Mayor's office light was still on as they entered their own office across the hall. The political corruption was evident when they were in trouble for entering the city of Monessen rather than being applauded for their work.McKetta 49‚Äì53. McKetta eventually served several positions within the state police force and was assigned in several different counties. For instance, after being promoted as a detective in 1952, he became a Detective-Sergeant in 1954, then a Lieutenant in 1956 and later became assistant superintendent of the State Police Academy with a Captain's rank. He also served in Greensburg, Erie, Somerset, New Kensington, Ebensburg, and Pittsburgh.\\"Acting Deputy Frank McKetta Selected as New Commissioner of Police by Governor Shafer.\\" Throughout this time he collected and observed cases of police corruption which were documented in the Frank McKetta Papers. Career in law enforcement leadership State Commissioner In 1967 Frank McKetta was appointed the Commissioner of the State Police by Governor Raymond P. Shafer. Shafer was satisfied with his previous background in dealing with labor disturbances and his efforts to establish troop training programs. He also agreed with Frank's work and position on rackets, corruption, and his attempts to progress the state police force. \\"As a veteran of more than three decades of experience covering all phases of police work beginning as a patrolman, Major McKetta is completely qualified to head the force he has served so well\\", said Shafer. Not everyone believed that making McKetta Commissioner was going to be positive for the state police. The same people that persecuted a previous Deputy Commissioner for a wiretap scandal made allegations that McKetta was involved, but this was easily disproved and the Senate unanimously confirmed him as the Commissioner.McKetta 68‚Äì69. Now as a higher rank, Frank McKetta immediately attempted to assemble a qualified staff whose loyalty was to the department rather than political benefactors. He wanted to repair the flawed Pennsylvania State Police System and create a police force based upon the oath in which all officers are sworn in under. He had a hard time finding out who he could and could not trust. With this in mind, he created a department who he thought believed in similar ideals and had the same goals for the department. While Commissioner, he continued fighting the rackets where the previous Commissioner left off. At the time, the state police was divided into fifteen troops who were commanded by higher officers who in turn were commanded by an even higher rank. Under this, McKetta watched all of the activities of rackets as well as putting undercover officers in the field who would feed him useful information.\\"Acting Deputy Frank McKetta Selected as New Commissioner of Police by Governor Shafer.\\" Communicator Jan. 1967: Vol. 5 Num. 1.McKetta 69‚Äì70. Dealing First Hand with Corruption and Politics During the time that McKetta was a trooper and non-commissioned officer, he was able to see first hand some of the political influences on local and state police. When appointed Commissioner he was able to see further into the corruption of the police force and how it attempted to affect him and his staff. One prime example was the downfall of his Deputy Commissioner, Lt. Colonel Dussia. While McKetta had high hopes and found him to be a likable person, it was not long until he was able to see he was \\"wired in\\" with the politicians and some questionable characters.McKetta 88. From the start Dussia was unhappy about not receiving the Commissioner's position after hearing word from a politician that the job was his. Shortly after being sworn in, Dussia approached McKetta about holding a banquet for him because he was a local boy who was making it big. The sponsor of the banquet was supposed to be a local businessman from Greensburg where he had previously worked in his career. With this knowledge McKetta accepted the offer but soon found from an old friend and fellow police officer that the banquet was actually being sponsored by a local racketeer. This was a prime opportunity for a racket to promote himself by having ties with a State Police Commissioner. Now learning the truth behind this plan, he told Dussia to cancel the banquet without letting him know of his recent knowledge about the sponsor issue. This would only be the first of Dussia's attempts to bring McKetta down along with others who would eventually harass him and his family. After making progress in the arrest of many racketeers and conducting many raids, a judge started asking questions about his radar operations. After McKetta showed him, he was asked to have lunch with the judge at a restaurant where politicians and racketeers often meet. His attempts to request a change in the location were refused, however he agreed to have lunch. During the meal, the judge got up briefly and the Senator quickly made a bribe for a large amount of money. McKetta pretended not to hear the Senator and began conversation with an associate who sat down at a nearby table.McKetta 89‚Äì93. Involving His Home Life During McKetta's years as Commissioner, his family was threatened with phone calls, and his own son was attacked outside his apartment. After refusing the proposal from the Senator, he received several threatening telephone calls to his home which affected himself as well as his family. Several instances occurred when McKetta was driving home in the evening from the office and a car would force him off the road. At the time McKetta thought was just a poor driver. Later that night at 2:00 am McKetta received a phone call at his house from a disguised voice. The person stated what time he left his office and the exact route he took to his house. He then spoke of how easy it would be to kill him. After this he and his family received other phone calls that said things along the lines of \\"watch your step\\" and so on. The State Police Commissioner and his family did not take them seriously as they assumed no one would do anything because of the negative publicity it would bring to them. This assumption was quickly proven wrong when one morning around 2:00am there was a call saying \\"Your son will tell you what happened.\\"McKetta 94 He then learned that at about 10:30am that morning his wife received a call from their son telling her that two men had held him up in front of his apartment at the University of Pittsburgh. He described them as two white middle aged men wearing suits and ties. They were standing outside his doorway when he came home. He thought nothing of them because of their atire. As he walked by one, he was struck from behind and then attacked by the other. He was slashed in the chest by what seemed like a razor and finally crawled under a parked car and called for help. The men walked casually away and when the Pittsburgh City Police arrived, they took his name and then did not even come out of the car to take his report. This showed that whoever attacked Frank McKetta III had an in with the police. Now that his work was beginning to affect the safety of his family, he became more cautious about their safety but refused to stop his attacks on political corruption and the rackets.McKetta 94‚Äì95. Retirement from State Commissioner After several years of fighting to make a change in the state police department, McKetta was offered a job with the U.S. General Services Administration to help with heading the organization that provides security to all federal buildings in the nation. By 1971 his common sense told him it was time to leave the state police and take full advantage of this new opportunity. He stayed until the end of the Governor's term and learned that it was smart to take the job in Washington D.C. because he was going replaced with the new Governor. He accepted the position as Chief of the Federal Protective Service and then later in June 1972 was named Assistant Commissioner. He worked in the management office which governed security at federal installations nationwide. McKetta 110. After five years working in Washington DC, Frank McKetta was faced with a severe arthritic condition affecting his spine. As a result of this he left his position in 1976 but made it a point to stay contacted with people still inside the GSA to help with the corruption that had developed at the federal level.McKetta 167. Legacy U.S. Federal Protective Service. Theories and Influences on the Police Department Throughout his career and even after retirement, Col. Frank McKetta addressed and tried to fix many problems throughout the State Police Force. Here are a few of the main concerns and solutions he worked on and expressed with great emphasis to the police department: # \\"Models for police departments should be based on demographic and community needs.\\"McKetta, p 194 Each size and location should be specific to the quantity of officers. He also believed that overstaffing was an opportunity for less control as well as less personal contact with civilians. With this, he also believed that assignments should be rotated for career development as well as prevention against stratification in the agency.McKetta 194-195. # McKetta believed that each recruit should be evaluated according to qualifications and without any bias towards favoritism or political affiliations.McKetta 196. # When promotions are made open or needed, McKetta believed in written examinations and when necessary, an oral assessment with board interviews.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Sioux City. History Rev. Jeremiah Tracey celebrated the first Mass in Sioux City in the log cabin of Mr. and Mrs. Louis Desy in 1855. The Cathedral of the Epiphany had its beginnings as St. Mary's Church in 1891. Rev. Timothy Treacy was the first pastor of the parish that was intended to serve the needs of a growing number of Irish and German immigrant Catholics in the central part of the city. However, construction of a new church was delayed because of the economic depression that hit the United States in 1893. For the next 10 years, parishioners worshipped in the basement of the present church. When Pope Leo XIII established the Diocese of Sioux City in 1902, Bishop Philip Garrigan decided that St. Mary's Church would serve as the cathedral and began work to complete the upper church. He also sought permission from the Holy See to change the name of the parish. Bishop Garrigan dedicated the edifice, without its signature spires, on September 8, 1904, as the Cathedral of the Epiphany. A minor renovation of the cathedral was carried out in 1939 when Monsignor Thomas Conghlan was the pastor. In 1952, the two spires were added to the towers. In 1961 a building project was initiated by Bishop Joseph Mueller. It completely changed the interior of the cathedral. A new marble altar with baldachin replaced the old wooden altar. It also included other new furnishings, paint schemes, and lighting. In the 1980s as the number of parishioners started to significantly decline, consideration was given to closing the parish. An influx of Catholic immigrants from Latin America and Southeast Asia reversed that trend. Today the parish continues to foster diversity as Masses are offered in English, Spanish, and Latin. The most recent renovation project was in 1994 and addressed roofing, gutters, tuckpointing, and other exterior issues as well as restoring many of the interior elements and decoration that were removed in 1961. A $1 million gift from William and Eleanore Metz started the fundraising campaign for the $3 million interior remodeling project. Des Moines architect Larry Ericsson of the restoration firm Wetherell-Ericsson was responsible for the designs that were meant to reflect the building's early 20th-century appearance. The cathedral was rededicated on November 10, 1998. Architecture The cathedral is considered a fine example of 19th-century German Gothic design. The baptismal font was designed by local architect William L. Steele. The cathedral's sixty-one stained glass windows are from Franz Mayer & Co. in Munich, Germany, and were restored in the late 1980s. The reredos in the apse, the side altars, and Stations of the Cross are from the former St. Thomas Church in Emmetsburg, Iowa. It closed while work was underway during the 1990s renovation and the items were donated to the cathedral as they are similar in style to those same items removed from the cathedral in 1961. Religious statues were hand-carved and hand-painted in Italy. Pipe organ The Orgelbau Wech (2006) pipe organ is in a gallery-level case in the rear of the cathedral. It features a traditional style console with a mechanical action console that is detached from the main case. It is equipped with two manuals, 3 divisions, 31 stops, 29 registers, 37 ranks. The manual compass is 58 notes and the pedal compass is 30 notes. The organ has slider chests, balanced mechanical key action, and electric stop action. The drawknobs are arraigned in horizontal rows on terraced/stepped jambs. There are balanced swell shoes/pedals. The combination action is a computerized/digital system. Rounding out the features are a slightly concave, straight pedalboard, combination action thumb pistons, combination action toe studs, coupler reversible thumb pistons, and coupler reversible toe studs.

The last graduation from Cathedral High School was held on June 1, 1949. That fall Bishop Heelan Catholic High School opened and the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary continued to teach at Heelan. By 1957, it became obvious that both Epiphany and Heelan needed new school facilities. The diocese held a fund drive and purchased three lots at the corner of Tenth and Douglas Streets for $40,500. The new grade school was built on the site and opened in September 1959. The parish grade school closed when schools from Epiphany, St. Boniface, and St. Joseph consolidated in 1987 to form Holy Family School. The former school building, now called Epiphany Center, houses offices, parish center, and religious education classrooms for the parish.

Jarvis (1890‚Äì1990) was an American politician and restaurateur. Biography Andrew Harry Jarvis (born Andreas Harry Giavis) was born in Magouliana, Greece, on April 7, 1890, and immigrated to the United States in the early 1900s. He arrived in New York and then went to Lowell, Massachusetts, where he stayed with distant family while working in a mill to learn English at the pay of $3.50 a week. It is family lore that every day for lunch he would have apple pie because it was all he could order in English. Over the next ten years, he would become fluent in English and receive a good American education through night school. He then opened his first restaurant, the Jarvis Cafeteria, in 1913 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Over the next few decades, he opened a handful of other restaurants and candy/ice cream stores in Portsmouth, Lawrence, Massachusetts, and Brunswick, Maine. He was a lifelong Republican and served as mayor of Portsmouth 1958‚Äì1959 and as a member of the Executive Council of New Hampshire 1961‚Äì1963. He was encouraged to run for Governor but was self-conscious about his heavy Greek accent and decided not to. He was a delegate at the Republican National Convention in 1956. He met every Republican president from the early 1920s until his death and worked on the campaigns of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush. Andrew Jarvis was a close personal friend of Senator Styles Bridges. In the early 1980s, his nephews took over his restaurant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Andrew Jarvis retired. He was a member of many organizations including Rotary International and his local Masonic Lodge. Every year in Portsmouth the Rotary Club holds the Andrew and Grace Jarvis Memorial Road Race in honor of him and his wife. Mr. Jarvis was a supporter of many charities. Mr. Jarvis is credited for helping to start the Strawberry Bank Historical Society which helped transform a seedy area of downtown Portsmouth back into a beautiful historic New England town by renovating the 18th century historic homes. He also helped bring the Pease Air Force Base to Portsmouth. Andrew Jarvis died in early 1990 one month before his 100th birthday. The Portsmouth Rotary club had planned a 100th birthday party for him. They instead held a celebration in his honor where his daughter gave a speech talking about his life and service to Portsmouth. After fearing that his daughter, Catherine (1924-2013), would become blind from sickness as a baby, Andrew Jarvis made a promise to God to help the blind in his native Greece. After World War II, Jarvis helped to found the American Friends of the Blind in Greece (AFBG) in 1946 which set up a school and museum for the blind in Greece paid for by donations by Greek-Americans. He was the president until his death in 1990 at which time his son-in-law took over until 2007.

She has over 30 years experience as a practitioner with people whose severe learning disabilities are linked with behavioural distress. Caldwell graduated from the University of Bristol with an honorary doctorate of science in 2011. In 2009, Caldwell was awarded with the Times Sternberg Prize as she has major contributions beyond the age of 70. She was a Rowntree Research Fellow for four years. She trains professionals, therapists, managers, practitioners, parents and carers in the approach known as Intensive Interaction. She is employed by the NHS, anSocial Services, Community Services and Education Services to work with difficult-to-provide-for individuals. She is the author of eight books, including 'Finding You Finding Me', 'From Isolation to Intimacy, and 'Using Intensive Interaction and Sensory Integration' (the latter two with Jane Horwood, Paediatric Occupational Therapist) published by Jessica Kingsley Publishers. She also features in four training films.  Early life  At the beginning of her career with autistic people, she began her work as an untrained occupational therapy assistant. The work consisted of autistic men who were in long term institutions in the Bristol area. As Caldwell began her work, she began to undertake unconventional ways of working with and assisting those in the institution. She decided that painting and creating murals would help liven up the dull corridor in which they were confined to during her time as an assistant. After being terminated from her first position, she continues her work elsewhere in the surrounding areas of Bristol. After recognition spread about Caldwell's work, Bristol University sponsored the creation of a training video, featuring herself.  Personal life  Phoebe Caldwell is in her late 70's and has five children and nine grandchildren.  Intensive Interaction  Phoebe Caldwell has created a system based on imitation of body language to communicate with autistic people. It is known that autistic people tend to protect themselves from sensory overload by stimming. Caldwell has studied this and instead of attempting to intervene, she uses it to gain their attention. \\"Contrary to what is normally understood, children on the autistic spectrum do recognise when we use their own body language to communicate, provided we respond using the repertoire of their personal behaviours. We are shifting their attention from solitary self-stimulation to shared activity\\" It is important to pay attention to how they do this and the feelings behind it, just mimicking tends to only catch their attention for a short period of time; we need to answer. By echoing them, this will interact with their brain in a positive way and reducing stress, \\"Aloneness becomes a shared interest.\\" Legitimacy Phoebe Caldwell has been recognised ) by BBC newshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7ZxGFNJ4bw and The Times. She recently won the Times/Sternberg award for her work to improve the outlook for autistic people with learning disabilities.http://www.phoebecaldwell.co.uk/  Awards   The Times/Sternberg Active Life Award  Phoebe Caldwell was awarded this in 2009 at age 76, after over 35 years of work, pioneering autism support. She has created a system that encourages parents and caretakers of autistic people to study their body language and echo them. She commonly teaches this system to parents for free and she has improved the lives and relationships of every single one she has worked with.

It was designed with a 105 degree grip angle, the same as the Colt M1911 pistol, to maintain a consistent grip angle. Production history In July 1947, two prototypes‚Äînumbered X-41 and X-42‚Äîwere produced, tested, and improved for the next 10 years. In 1957, the Model 41 was made available to the public for sale when Smith & Wesson produced 679 units. At the end of 1958, they had built 9,875 Model 41 pistols. A lighter barrel was offered in 1958 for field use. The Model 41-1 was introduced in 1960 and was chambered in .22 Short for International Rapid Fire competition. Only 1000 were made using light aluminum slides necessary for function with the lower powered .22 Short. In August 1963, the 5-inch heavy barrel version came into the market. Stoeger's Shooter's Bible of 1964 shows a barrel grooved for Olympic center weights. The cocking indicator and -inch barrel were dropped in 1978. The barrel was introduced in 1978 with no provision for a muzzle brake. A barrel was offered for a few months in 1991. In 1992, the Model 41 was dropped from production. In 1994, Smith & Wesson returned it to production as the Model 41 (New Model). Model 46 In 1957, Smith & Wesson offered a \\"no frills\\" version of the Model 41, designated the Model 46. In 1959, it was selected by the U.S. Air Force for basic marksmanship training. About 4000 units were made in total: 2500 with a barrel, 1000 with barrels, and 500 with barrels. The pistol lacked the checkering, polished blue finish, and other refinements of the Model 41. It proved to be a commercial failure with consumers who preferred the more costly Model 41, and production ceased in 1966.

It is under the direction of the Primatiale parish and was named in honor of Saint George. The cathedral is near the Place Beno√Æt- Cr√©pu, between the quarter of the and Saint-Jean quarters. History A church located on this place was built in 550, but was destroyed around 732 during a raid of the Saracens, but was restored in 802 by Leidrade. In the fourteenth century, it remained a parish church, but was used by the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, or Order of Malta, and in 1315, the Commandery was located just next and had several windows and two cylindrical towers overlooking the Sa√¥ne. Lange's family paid for the repairs of the church which were conducted by the commander Humbert de Beauvoir. In 1793, it became a hay barn and became a national property, in 1892, was restored by the architect Pollet. The current church was rebuilt in 1845 and completed in 1848, after plans by the architect Pierre Bossan who also made plans for the basilica of Fourviere. Abandoned between the late 1970s and 1989, the church was later assigned by Cardinal Albert Decourtray to the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter under the Motu proprio Ecclesia Dei, which granted the practice of liturgical books of 1962 in Latin. The community was given by Cardinal Philippe Barbarin to three priests from the Fraternity of St. Peter, who joined the diocese. On 25 August 2007, Cardinal Barbarin signed the incardination of three of the five priests who served the church. Also in 2007, after repairs to the exterior of the church and adjoining spaces, the inauguration took place in the presence of Cardinal Barbarin and Senator-Mayor of Lyon G√©rard Collomb. Architecture The church was rebuilt in neogothic style. Architect Pierre Bossan, who also made the furniture, later deemed his work on this church as a \\"youthful mistake\\". The sculpture on the facade was made by Charles Dufraine and stained glasses are the artwork of Mar√©chal de Metz. The building is classified as monument historique.

U.S. Patent No. 6,323,003, http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT6323003 U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Retrieved on 11 February 2010 In molecular biology, a riboregulator is a ribonucleic acid (RNA) that responds to a signal nucleic acid molecule by Watson-Crick base pairing. A riboregulator may respond to a signal molecule in any number of manners including, translation (or repression of translation) of the RNA into a protein, activation of a ribozyme, release of silencing RNA (siRNA), conformational change, and/or binding other nucleic acids. Riboregulators contain two canonical domains, a sensor domain and an effector domain. These domains are also found on riboswitches, but unlike riboswitches, the sensor domain only binds complementary RNA or DNA strands as opposed to small molecules. Because binding is based on base-pairing, a riboregulator can be tailored to differentiate and respond to individual genetic sequences and combinations thereof. Types of riboregulators An illustration of a stem- loop riboregulator in the presence of target RNA Lechner RL (1991). PCT Patent Application No. WO 92/13070, http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?WO=199213070 World Intellectual Property Organization, Retrieved on 11 February 2010 Translational riboregulator Translational riboregulators regulate the ability of a ribosome complex to scan, assemble, and/or translate an RNA molecule into a protein. In translational riboregulators, the RNA molecule is repressed or de-repressed depending on the secondary structure of the RNA molecule. Signal-responsive structures are usually introduced into the 5‚Ä≤ untranslated region (5‚Ä≤ UTR) of the RNA molecules using standard molecular biological techniques. As discovered by Marilyn Kozak, the small (40S) ribosome complex scans an RNA molecule from 5‚Ä≤ untranslated region to the start codon. When the complex encounters secondary structure, it must melt the structure to reach the start codon or it will fall off the molecule. The complex moves along through the untranslated region until it stalls just prior to reaching the start codon because it encounters a highly conserved sequence (a Kozak consensus sequence in eukaryotes, or Shine-Dalgarno sequence in prokaryotes). The stalled complex then combines with the large ribosome (60S) to begin translating the RNA into protein. Lechner invented the first riboregulator in 1991. Lechner used a self pairing stem-loop which inhibited translation of a prokaryotic RNA, unless a complementary RNA sequence (anti- inhibitor) was present. In 1997, Black engineered the first eukaryotic riboregulator using antisense molecules to prevent translation (Nucline RNA). In the Nucline system, antisense molecules block translation unless removed via competitive hybridization and strand-displacement by specific signal RNA sequences such as HIV RNA and oncogene RNA.http://www.sunpillar.com/helpexamples.html Retrieved on 11 February 2010 In 2003, Black demonstrated that Nucline RNA could perform Boolean and arithmetic operations (If-then-else, AND gate, OR gate and \\"Molar concentration of x > molar concentration of y\\" calculations ) in HIV infected monocytes and breast cancer cells. http://pharmtech.findpharma.com/pharmtech/data/articlestandard//pharmagenomics/232003/59233/article.pdf http://www.sunpillar.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/nuclinetalkjul93_uploadagain.ppt In 2004, Isaacs et al. modified Lechner‚Äôs original system to demonstrate both trans and cis repression in a prokaryotic cells. Bayer & Smolke further developed a translational riboregulator in 2005 that could respond to small molecules creating a hybrid riboswitch/riboregulator molecule, termed an anti- switch. In an anti-switch, the presence of a small organic molecule binds an aptamer sequence in the RNA molecule which unmasks an otherwise sequestered antisense sequence, which can bind and block target RNA translation. Ribozyme riboregulator Ribozyme riboregulators regulate the ability of a catalytic RNA molecule to cleave a target nucleic acid sequence. In ribozyme riboregulators, a hammerhead ribozyme RNA molecule is activated or inactivated depending on the change of the secondary structure induced by hybridizing a signal molecule such as a cognate DNA or RNA sequence. In 2008, Win & Smolke designed a ribozyme regulator that could function in yeast cells that carried out Boolean operations similar to the earlier translational riboregulators, including AND, NAND, NOR, and OR gates. RNAi-based riboregulator RNAi riboregulators are small interfering RNAs which respond to a signal input such as complementary hybridization with a DNA or RNA molecule. The presence or absence of a target molecule determines whether the siRNA downregulates gene expression. In 2007, Rinaudo et al. demonstrated that RNAi based riboregulators can also perform Boolean operations in cells. pH riboregulator pH riboregulators regulate gene expression in response to pH changes. The only known pH riboregulator upregulates the alx gene in E. coli when in alkaline conditions, particularly above pH 8. The pH riboregulator was found, through experimentation, to reside in the 5‚Ä≤ UTR of the alx gene. When in pH 7 or below, the pH riboregulator element (PRE) exists in an inactive 'N' state; in alkali conditions, RNA polymerase controls the folding of this ncRNA to its 'H' active form. The ribosome binding site of the alx gene is now exposed and the 30s subunit is allowed to bind. Uses of riboregulators Currently, riboregulators have found utility in the area of synthetic biology and personalized medicine. In synthetic biology, riboregulators can be used to regulate bacterial responses and probe gene regulatory networks. Undergraduate systems biology students use standardized riboregulators to compete in an annual bio-engineering competition (The international Genetically Engineered Machine competition, iGEM).http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:Caltech/2007/Project/Riboregulator In addition, because the various riboregulators can be tailored to respond to complex biological signals, riboregulators offer the promise of individually tailored RNA based drugs which respond to genes, small molecules and proteins in individuals cells.

Jones, one of five children of Will and Ella Jones, grew up in Muscoda, a Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company mining camp near Bessemer, Alabama. After his mother formed a favorable impression of Northern schools while visiting the 1939 New York World's Fair, he was sent off to continue his education there. He returned to Alabama during high school and attended Alabama State University on scholarship. He was elected president of his freshman class and played on the Bulldogs football team. After two years he decided to pursue the study of law. He transferred to Howard University in Washington D. C. to complete his undergraduate studies. His application to the University of Alabama Law School in 1949 was officially discouraged on the basis of race. He completed a year of graduate work at Howard before returning to Bessemer. In the 1960s, Jones was part of the \\"Birmingham Interracial Committee\\" of the \\"Jefferson County Coordinating Council for Social Forces\\" and later worked for the United States Department of Justice on Civil Rights issues and later the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where he was recognized for his work on the Model Cities Program. He also served as deputy director of the Peace Corps in Thailand. In the early 1960s, Jones was inspired by the annual African-American art shows organized by Hale Woodruff at Atlanta University. He began collecting works by African-American artists, often befriending the younger artists from whom he purchased works. He hosted receptions at his home to encourage colleagues to purchase art and put pressure on galleries and museums to recognize African- American artwork. Jones eventually amassed an important collection with over 2,000 pieces. A selection of his collection made its public debut in a 1993 exhibition at the University of Delaware. In 2001 Jones donated hundreds of the more valuable works to that University with several stipulations for how the school should leverage it to provide more opportunities for black students and art professionals. In 2008 he donated most of his remaining collection, 1,700 works, to the University of Alabama. Dr. Amalia Amaki is the Curator of the Paull R.

It is utilized in both research and development (R&D;) in commercial and academic laboratories as well as production situations where the quantity of virus at various steps is an important variable. For example, the production of viral vaccines, recombinant proteins using viral vectors and viral antigens all require virus quantification to continually adapt and monitor the process in order to optimize production yields and respond to ever changing demands and applications. Examples of specific instances where known viruses need to be quantified include clone screening, multiplicity of infection (MOI) optimization and adaptation of methods to cell culture. This page discusses various techniques currently used to quantify viruses in liquid samples. These methods are separated into two categories, traditional vs. modern methods. Traditional methods are industry-standard methods that have been used for decades but are generally slow and labor-intensive. Modern methods are relatively new commercially available products and kits that greatly reduce quantification time. This is not meant to be an exhaustive review of all potential methods, but rather a representative cross-section of traditional methods and new, commercially available methods. While other published methods may exist for virus quantification, non-commercial methods are not discussed here. Traditional methods Plaque assay Viral Plaques of Herpes Simplex Virus Plaque-based assays are the standard method used to determine virus concentration in terms of infectious dose. Viral plaque assays determine the number of plaque forming units (pfu) in a virus sample, which is one measure of virus quantity. This assay is based on a microbiological method conducted in petri dishes or multi-well plates. Specifically, a confluent monolayer of host cells is infected with the virus at varying dilutions and covered with a semi-solid medium, such as agar or carboxymethyl cellulose, to prevent the virus infection from spreading indiscriminately. A viral plaque is formed when a virus infects a cell within the fixed cell monolayer. The virus infected cell will lyse and spread the infection to adjacent cells where the infection-to-lysis cycle is repeated. The infected cell area will create a plaque (an area of infection surrounded by uninfected cells) which can be seen with an optical microscope or visually (pouring off the overlay medium and adding a crystal violet solution for 15 minutes until it has colored the cytoplasm, gently removing the excess with water will show uncolored the location of dead cells). Plaque formation can take 3‚Äì14 days, depending on the virus being analyzed. Plaques are generally counted manually and the results, in combination with the dilution factor used to prepare the plate, are used to calculate the number of plaque forming units per sample unit volume (pfu/mL). The pfu/mL result represents the number of infective particles within the sample and is based on the assumption that each plaque formed is representative of one infective virus particle. Focus forming assay (FFA) Cells infected by rotavirus (top) and uninfected cells (bottom) The focus forming assay (FFA) is a variation of the plaque assay, but instead of relying on cell lysis in order to detect plaque formation, the FFA employs immunostaining techniques using fluorescently labeled antibodies specific for a viral antigen to detect infected host cells and infectious virus particles before an actual plaque is formed. The FFA is particularly useful for quantifying classes of viruses that do not lyse the cell membranes, as these viruses would not be amenable to the plaque assay. Like the plaque assay, host cell monolayers are infected with various dilutions of the virus sample and allowed to incubate for a relatively brief incubation period (e.g., 24‚Äì72 hours) under a semisolid overlay medium that restricts the spread of infectious virus, creating localized clusters (foci) of infected cells. Plates are subsequently probed with fluorescently labeled antibodies against a viral antigen, and fluorescence microscopy is used to count and quantify the number of foci. The FFA method typically yields results in less time than plaque or fifty-percent-tissue-culture-infective-dose (TCID50) assays, but it can be more expensive in terms of required reagents and equipment. Assay completion time is also dependent on the size of area that the user is counting. A larger area will require more time but can provide a more accurate representation of the sample. Results of the FFA are expressed as focus forming units per milliliter, or FFU/mL. Endpoint dilution assay Fifty-percent tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) is the measure of infectious virus titer. This endpoint dilution assay quantifies the amount of virus required to kill 50% of infected hosts or to produce a cytopathic effect in 50% of inoculated tissue culture cells. This assay may be more common in clinical research applications where the lethal dose of virus must be determined or if the virus does not form plaques. When used in the context of tissue culture, host cells are plated and serial dilutions of the virus are added. After incubation, the percentage of cell death (i.e. infected cells) is manually observed and recorded for each virus dilution, and results are used to mathematically calculate a TCID50 result. Due to distinct differences in assay methods and principles, TCID50 and pfu/mL or other infectivity assay results are not equivalent. This method can take up to a week due to cell infectivity time. Two methods commonly used to calculate TCID50 (can also be used to calculate other types of 50% endpoint such EC50, IC50, and LD50) are: * Spearman-Karber * Reed-Muench method The theoretical relationship between TCID50 and PFU is approximately 0.69 PFU = 1 TCID50 based on the Poisson distribution, a probability distribution which describes how many random events (virus particles) occurring at a known average rate (virus titer) are likely to occur in a fixed space (the amount of virus medium in a well). However it must be emphasized that in practice, this relationship may not hold even for the same virus + cell combination, as the two types of assay are set up differently and virus infectivity is very sensitive to various factors such as cell age, overlay media, etc. But the following reference defines the relationship differently: Assuming that the same cell system is used, that the virus forms plaques on those cells, and that no procedures are added which would inhibit plaque formation, 1 ml of virus stock would be expected to have about half of the number of plaque forming units (PFUs) as TCID50. This is only an estimate but is based on the rationale that the limiting dilution which would infect 50% of the cell layers challenged would often be expected to initially produce a single plaque in the cell layers which become infected. In some instances, two or more plaques might by chance form, and thus the actual number of PFUs should be determined experimentally. Mathematically, the expected PFUs would be somewhat greater than one-half the TCID50, since the negative tubes in the TCID50 represent zero plaque forming units and the positive tubes each represent one or more plaque forming units. A more precise estimate is obtained by applying the Poisson distribution. Where P(o) is the proportion of negative tubes and m is the mean number of infectious units per volume (PFU/ml), P(o) = e(-m). For any titer expressed as a TCID50, P(o) = 0.5. Thus e(-m) = 0.5 and m = -ln 0.5 which is ~ 0.7. Therefore, one could multiply the TCID50 titer (per ml) by 0.7 to predict the mean number of PFU/ml. When actually applying such calculations, remember the calculated mean will only be valid if the changes in protocol required to visualize plaques do not alter the expression of infectious virus as compared with expression under conditions employed for TCID50. Thus as a working estimate, one can assume material with a TCID50 of 1 √ó 105 TCID50/ml will produce 0.7 √ó 105 PFUs/ml. (from: ATCC - Converting TCID50 to plaque forming units PFU-124 ) Protein assays There are several variations of protein-based virus quantification assays. In general, these methods quantify either the amount of all protein or the amount of a specific virus protein in the sample rather than the number of infected cells or virus particles. Quantification most commonly relies on fluorescence detection. Some assay variations quantify protein directly in a sample while other variations require host cell infection and incubation to allow virus growth prior to protein quantification. The variation used depends primarily on the amount of protein (i.e. virus) in the initial sample and the sensitivity of the assay itself. If incubation and virus growth are required, cell and/or virus lysis/digestion are often conducted prior to analysis. Most protein-based methods are relatively fast and sensitive but require quality standards for accurate calibration, and quantify protein, not actual virus particle concentrations. Below are specific examples of widely used protein- based assays. Hemagglutination assay The hemagglutination assay (HA) is a common non-fluorescence protein quantification assay specific for influenza. It relies on the fact that hemagglutinin, a surface protein of influenza viruses, agglutinates red blood cells (i.e. causes red blood cells to clump together). In this assay, dilutions of an influenza sample are incubated with a 1% erythrocyte solution for one hour and the virus dilution at which agglutination first occurs is visually determined. The assay produces a result of hemagglutination units (HAU), with typical pfu to HAU ratios in the 106 range. This assay takes ~1‚Äì2 hours to complete and results can differ widely based on the technical expertise of the operator. The hemagglutination inhibition assay is a common variation of the HA assay used to measure flu- specific antibody levels in blood serum. In this variation, serum antibodies to the influenza virus will interfere with the virus attachment to red blood cells. Therefore, hemagglutination is inhibited when antibodies are present at a sufficient concentration. Bicinchoninic acid assay The bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) is based on a simple colorimetric measurement and is the most common protein quantification assay. BCA is similar to the Lowry or Bradford protein assays and was first made commercially available by Pierce, which is now owned by Thermo Fisher Scientific. In the BCA assay, a protein's peptide bonds quantitatively reduce Cu2+ to Cu1+, which produces a light blue color. BCA chelates Cu1+ at a 2:1 ratio resulting in a more intensely colored species that absorbs at 562 nm. Absorbance of a sample at 562 nm is used to determine the bulk protein concentration in the sample. Assay results are compared with known standard curves after analysis with a spectrophotometer or plate reader. Total assay time is 30 minutes to one hour. While this assay is ubiquitous and fast, it lacks specificity since it counts all protein, the virus preparation to be quantified must contain very low levels host cell proteins. Single radial immunodiffusion assay Single radial immunodiffusion assay (SRID), also known as the Mancini method, is a protein assay that detects the amount of specific viral antigen by immunodiffusion in a semi-solid medium (e.g. agar). The medium contains antiserum specific to the antigen of interest and the antigen is placed in the center of the disc. As the antigen diffuses into the medium it creates a precipitate ring that grows until equilibrium is reached. Assay time can range from 10 hours to days depending on equilibration time of the antigen and antibody. The zone diameter from the ring is linearly related to the log of protein concentration and is compared to zone diameters for known protein standards for quantification. There are kits and serums commercially available for this assay (e.g. The Binding Site Inc.). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) TEM is a specialized type of microscopy that utilizes a beam of electrons focused with a magnetic field to image a sample. TEM provides imaging with 1000x greater spatial resolution than a light microscope (resolution down to 0.2 nm). An ultrathin, negatively stained sample is required. Sample preparations involve depositing specimens onto a coated TEM grid and negative staining with an electron-opaque liquid. Tissue embedded samples can also be examined if thinly sectioned. Sample preparations vary depending on protocol and user but generally require hours to complete. TEM images can show individual virus particles and quantitative image analysis can be used to determine virus concentrations. These high resolution images also provide particle morphology information that most other methods cannot. Quantitative TEM results will often be greater than results from other assays as all particles, regardless of infectivity, are quantified in the reported virus-like particles per mL (vlp/mL) result. Quantitative TEM generally works well for virus concentrations greater than 106 particles/mL. Because of high instrument cost and the amount of space and support facilities needed, TEM equipment is available in a limited number of facilities. Modern methods Tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) Tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) is a method that allows high-throughput single particle measurements of individual virus particles, as they are driven through a size- tunable nanopore, one at a time.Stephen J. Sowerby, Murray F. Broom, George B. Petersen. \\"Dynamically resizable nanometre-scale apertures for molecular sensing\\" Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical Volume 123, Issue 1 (2007), pages 325-330 The technique has the advantage of simultaneously determining the size and concentration, of virus particles in solution with high resolution. This can be used in assessing sample stability and the contribution of aggregates, as well as total viral particle concentration (vp/mL).G. Seth Roberts, Sam Yu, Qinglu Zeng, Leslie C.L. Chan, Will Anderson, Aaron H. Colby, Mark W. Grinstaff, Steven Reid, Robert Vogel. ‚ÄúTunable Pores for Measuring Concentrations of Synthetic and Biological Nanoparticle Dispersions‚Äù Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 31 pp. 17-25, (2012). TRPS-based measurement occurs in an ionic buffer, and no pre-staining of samples is required prior to analysis, thus the technique is more rapid than those which require pre- treatment with fluorescent dyes, with a total preparation and measurement time of less than 10 minutes per sample. TRPS-bases virus analysis is commercially available through qViro-X systems, which have the ability to be decontaminated chemically by autoclaving after measurement has occurred. Flow cytometry While most flow cytometers do not have sufficient sensitivity, there are a few commercially available flow cytometers that can be used for virus quantification. A virus counter quantifies the number of intact virus particles in a sample using fluorescence to detect colocalized proteins and nucleic acids. Samples are stained with two dyes, one specific for proteins and one specific for nucleic acids, and analyzed as they flow through a laser beam. The quantity of particles producing simultaneous events on each of the two distinct fluorescence channels is determined, along with the measured sample flow rate, to calculate a concentration of virus particles (vp/mL). The results are generally similar in absolute quantity to a TEM result. The assay has a linear working range of 105‚Äì109 vp/mL and an analysis time of ~10 min with a short sample preparation time. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) ELISA Diagram Quantitative PCR utilizes polymerase chain reaction chemistry to amplify viral DNA or RNA to produce high enough concentrations for detection and quantification by fluorescence. In general, quantification by qPCR relies on serial dilutions of standards of known concentration being analyzed in parallel with the unknown samples for calibration and reference. Quantitative detection can be achieved using a wide variety of fluorescence detection strategies, including sequence specific probes or non-specific fluorescent dyes such as SYBR Green. Sequence specific probes, such as TaqMan (developed by Applied Biosystems), Molecular Beacons, or Scorpion, bind only to the DNA of the appropriate sequence produced during the reaction. SYBR Green dye binds to all double-stranded DNA produced during the reaction. While SYBR Green is easy to use, its lack of specificity and lower sensitivity lead most labs to use probe-based qPCR detection schemes. There are many variations of qPCR including the comparative threshold method, which allows relative quantification through comparison of Ct values (PCR cycles that show statistically significant increases in the product) from multiple samples that include an internal standard. PCR amplifies all target nucleic acid, including ones originating from intact infectious viral particles, from defective viral particles as well as free nucleic acid in solution. Because of this, qPCR results (expressed in terms of genome copies/mL) are likely to be higher in quantity than TEM results. For viral quantification, the ratio of whole virions to copies of nucleic acid is seldom one to one. This is because during viral replication, the nucleic acid and viral proteins are not always produced in 1:1 ratio and viral assembly process results in complete virions as well as empty capsids and/or excess free viral genomes. In the example of foot-and-mouth disease virus, the ratio of whole virions to RNA copies within an actively replicating host cell is approximately 1:1000.Callahan JD, et al., Use of a portable real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay for rapid detection of foot-and- mouth disease virus. J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2002 Jun 1;220(11):1636-42. Products for qPCR-based virus titration are available commercially through numerous companies (e.g. Invitrogen, Roche or Qiagen). Advantages of titration by qPCR include quick turnaround time (1‚Äì4 hours) and sensitivity (can detect much lower concentration of viruses than other methods). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ELISA is a more modern variation of a protein assay that utilizes a specific antibody linked to an enzyme to detect the presence of an unknown amount of antigen (i.e. virus) in a sample. The antibody-antigen binding event is detected and/or quantified through the enzyme's ability to convert a reagent to a detectable signal that can be used to calculate the concentration of the antigen in the sample. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is a common enzyme utilized in ELISA schemes due to its ability to amplify signal and increase assay sensitivity. There are many variations, or types of ELISA assays but they can generally be classified as either indirect, competitive, sandwich or reverse. ELISA kits are commercially available from numerous companies and quantification generally occurs via chromogenic reporters or fluorescence (e.g. Invitrogen, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). This technique is much less labor-intensive than the traditional methods and can take anywhere from 4 to 24 hours based on antibody incubation time.

The Class II and Class III UAVs were canceled in May 2007. The XM157 UAV was canceled when FCS was dissolved in June 2009. The final aircraft, the XM156, was canceled in February 2010 when the E-IBCT component of the BCT Modernization program was dissolved.  Vehicles  XM156 Class I XM156 Class I UAS The XM156 Class I was a platoon level asset that provided the dismounted soldier with Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and laser designation. Total system weight, which included the air vehicle, a control device, and ground support equipment is less than and was light enough to be carried by an individual soldier. This micro air vehicle operated in open, rolling, complex and urban terrains with a vertical take-off and landing capability. It was interoperable with select ground and air platforms and controlled by mounted or dismounted soldiers. The Class I used autonomous flight and navigation, but could interact with the network and Soldier to dynamically update routes and target information. It provides dedicated reconnaissance support and early warning to the smallest echelons of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) in environments not suited to larger assets. The Class I system provided a hover and stare capability that is not currently available in the Army UAV inventory for urban and route surveillance. The Class I system also filled known gaps that exist in force operations, such as: Protect Force in Counterinsurgency (COIN) Operations, Soldier Protection in COIN environment, Ability to Conduct Joint Urban Operations, Enhanced ISR/RSTA Capabilities, Hover and Stare operations. The Class I UAS was part of Spin Out 1 and entered evaluation by Soldiers at the Army Evaluation Task Force (AETF). It would have been be fielded to Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) starting in 2011.  Class II and Class III  In a December 2006 memo assistant acquisition secretary Claude Bolton directed FCS to end work on the Class II and III UAVs. XM157 Class II UAV ;Class II The Class II UAV would have supported the Infantry and Mounted Combat System Company Commanders with reconnaissance, security/early warning, target and designation. The Class II had twice the endurance and a wider range of capabilities than the Class I. It was a multifunctional aerial system possessing a Vertical Take-Off and Landing capability. The Class II Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) would be a vehicle- mounted system that provided Line-of-Sight enhanced dedicated imagery. The distinguishing capability of this UAV is target designation in all conditions. This provides the ability to direct Line-of-Sight (LOS), Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS), and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) fires. It could team with selected ground and air platforms, and provides limited communications relay. The Class II could be carried by two Soldiers. It had a 16 km radius of action, and can remain aloft for two hours.

It provides the capabilities of the Class I and Class II, but also provides communications relay, mine detection, Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) detection, and meteorological survey. The Class III Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has a six-hour endurance and a 40 km radius of action. It allows the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) battalion to deliver precision fires within the UA area of interest. The Class III must be able to take-off and land without a dedicated air field.

XM157 Class IV XM157 Class IV UAV The XM157 Class IV UAV, was intended to provide reconnaissance, aerial communications extension capability at the brigade level for the United States Army's Future Combat Systems program. Other missions were to include land mine and improvised explosive device detection, standoff chemical, biological and radiological detection, and electronic intelligence collection. It was to be organic to the Reconnaissance Surveillance Target Acquisition Squadron within the FCS brigade combat team, which will consist of troops of manned armed reconnaissance helicopters (ARH) and a separate troop of Class IV UAVs. The FCS Class IV UAV Program was cancelled in January 2010. Development The XM157 is derived from the Navy-Marine MQ-8 Fire Scout which was derived from the manned Schweizer S-333. The Army was evaluating a land-based version of the system for fielding of the aircraft to brigade combat teams. The XM157 was produced, in developmental stages, by Northrop Grumman. After cancellation of Future Combat Systems in early 2009, the aircraft was transferred to BCT Modernization. The aircraft was supposed to be fielded in 2014. In December 2010, The U.S. Army suspended its version of the Class IV UAV. The army believes that the fixed-wing and unmanned RQ-7 Shadow can meet future Army requirements with product improvements. Design The Block III AH-64D Apache attack helicopter would have had the capability to control Class IV UAVs from the cockpit, receive their imagery products, and exploit their remote laser designation capability. This manned-unmanned teaming capability will also be available on later models of the ARH.

Biography Clouds: Meteoros at London's St Pancras station by Lucy and Jorge Orta Jorge Orta was born in 1953, in Rosario, Argentina. After graduating simultaneously from the Faculty of Fine Arts and the Faculty of Architecture at the Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Orta began his career as a painter, winning numerous awards for his work. In response to the increasing censorship of the Argentine military regime, his practice shifted to more avant-garde and alternative forms of visual communication, such as mail art and action-performance, working in underground artist collectives. He was the first Argentine artist to explore video and image projection technology, staging a series of controversial public installations in Rosario: Transcurso Vital (1981), Testigos Blancos (1982), Madera y Trapo (1983), and Fusion de sangre Latinoamericana (1984). Orta was a lecturer in the Faculty of Fine Arts of the Universidad Nacional de Rosario and a member of CONICET, the Argentinean national council for scientific research, until 1984, when he received a scholarship from the Ministry of Foreign and European affairs to pursue a D.E.A. (Dipl√¥me d'√©tudes approfondies) at the Sorbonne in Paris. In 1991 a fire in his Quai de la Seine studio tragically destroyed his entire archive of ephemeral works conducted in Argentina. Parallel to a studio-based practice and the slow reconstruction of his archive, Orta began experimenting with the technology for large-scale image projection Light Works in the early 1980s and invented the Pyrex image plates for the PAE (Projector Art Effect) projectors. Exploring light as a new medium, he painted and illuminated mythical sites of architecture of cultural and historical significance across the world: Mount Aso (Japan), Cappadocia (Turkey), Z√≥calo (Mexico City), and Verdon Gorge (France). In 1995 he represented Argentina at the Biennale di Venezia with Light Works staged on Venetian Palaces along the Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal. The most exceptional Light Work took place in 1992 during a three-week expedition along the Andes mountain range and culminated at the Inca vestiges of Machu Picchu and Sacsayhuam√°n to partake in the Inti Raymi in front of 200,000 Peruvian Indians. In 1993 Orta founded Les Moulins together with his partner Lucy Orta with whom he now collaborates. Their major artworks include: Connector, OrtaWater, 70 x 7 The Meal, Antarctica, and Spirits.

The fort forms the southern end of the defensive curtain of the Haute Moselle Region, abutting the Fortified region of Belfort, which lies to its south. The Haute Moselle defenses form a link between the fortified encampments of √âpinal and Belfort. The fort overlooks the main roads to the northeast of Belfort, which form a crossroads at Giromagny. The fort was built as part of France's S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system of fortifications to defend France against a recurrence of the Prussian invasion of the 1870-71 Franco-Prussian War. The fort was among the most strongly armed forts in the northeast in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It received the first revolving armored turrets to be installed in a land fortification in France. The fort's official name, Fort Dorsner, commemorates General Jean Philippe Raymond Dorsner, who fought in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. Description The trapezoidal fort is arranged to face to the north, its entry to the south. The pink sandstone walls enclose a court which contains a central block which in turn contained magazines and barracks, as well as two twin 155mm Mougin gun turrets, which constituted the fort's primary armament. It was originally furnished with a variety of guns on the ramparts, which were gradually reduced as the vulnerability of fixed gun emplacements in the open air became apparent. Six casemates were arranged for indirect fire, along with two satellite batteries. An optical signal post permitted communication with the Fort du Salbert to the south. An 1890 modernization suppressed the casemates and replaced caponiers with counterscarps. Further modernizations saw the installation of electricity, three armored observation posts and detail improvements. More substantial changes, including the proposed installation of a 75mm gun turret were not carried out, but a shelter or abri-caverne for 100 soldiers was excavated. Portions of the fort were reinforced with concrete against shellfire during the First World War. History In 1940 the fort was manned by the 7th Battery of the 159th Position Artillery Regiment (RAP), part of the fortified region of Belfort under the French 8th Army, Army Group 3. From 16 March 1940 the RF Belfort became the 44th Fortress Corps (CAF). During the Battle of France the Mougin turrets fired on German forces. After the armistice the Germans used Giromagny to make propaganda films purporting to show the capture of a Maginot Line fortification using flamethrowers on a turret before blowing it up with dynamite. The Germans reinforced the fort during the war, but blew up the entry on retreating in 1944. Fort de Giromagny has been in the care of a preservation association since 1988.

Rangers He took over as regular stopper at the start of 1983‚Äì84 and his consistent performances earned him a move to Rangers in November 1986. Hamilton never played for the first team in what is usually recognised as a first class match (league, domestic cups, Europe), spending his time as number three in the hierarchy behind Chris Woods and Nicky Walker (later Bonni Ginzburg) and spent loan periods at East Stirlingshire, Stirling Albion, Clydebank and Leeds United (he never featured for the last-named).Lindsay Hamilton www.scottishleague.net ‚Äì A Scottish Fitba Forum But he did make a few appearances for what can be loosely described as the first eleven. In a Glasgow Cup game versus Clyde at Firhill in April 1987, he played his part to help Rangers win on penalties. He played before a five-figure crowd in a friendly against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park and made a few other appearances in testimonial and charity games, most notably coming on as a substitute for Chris Woods against Gretna in the benefit match for the Lockerbie Disaster Fund in January 1989. Later career Lindsay finally tasted action in the top flight when he signed for St Johnstone in the close season in 1990 and spent the next two seasons as a Premier Division regular before moving on to Dunfermline in 1992. He left the Pars for Portadown in Northern Ireland in 1994 and played in the team that won the Budweiser Cup before returning to Scotland and East Fife in 1995. He was a regular in the team that won promotion to the First Division in 1995‚Äì96 and in the side which were relegated the following season. His next port of call was Queen's Park though he played a few times on loan for Partick Thistle in 1997‚Äì98 as well. After that it was back to his first club, Stenhousemuir and another promotion- winning campaign in 1998‚Äì99. His final season was at Ochilview in 1999‚Äì2000 helping Stenny survive in the Second Division. His final appearance was in a 2‚Äì2 home draw against Ross County on 6 May 2000.

All his family were attached to the Guises, and he had their support, and was appointed Secretary of State at 26 years old (1557). He cultivated the arts and letters; in addition to his duties, he performed from the reign of Henry II of France to that of Charles IX. If his career was short, it was no less remarkable for the acts to which he contributed, and to which he attached his name. In 1559, he signed with the usual form: by the Board's view, the power given to the Duke of Guise, on behalf of Francis II, after the conspiracy of Amboise, to the Chancellor Olivier, despite written policy, that he had long refused to sign, because it gave the Duke of Guise nothing less than royal power, under the title of lieutenant general of the kingdom. In 1560, Robertet de Fresne, wrote on behalf of Francis II, the letter to the King of Navarre on the injunction to get his brother the Prince de Conde, to come to Orleans. Antoine de Bourbon complied unwisely, since the prince his brother was arrested, as leader of the conspiracy of Amboise, and sentenced to death. Florimond II died at the age of 36 years without a child. He spent part of his life at the Chateau de Beauregard, where a painting of his cousin Florimond is displayed in the portrait gallery.

He was appointed Secretary of State in 1559 at the recommendation of the Francis, Duke of Guise, under Francis II. He was and committed to serving the Duke of Guise and Catherine de Medici.

Background  On March 2, 1939, (two weeks before the German occupation), the Czecho-Slovak government ordered that a labor camp be set up for \\"people avoiding work and living off crime\\" (at this time labour duty was mandatory). The camp next to the village Hodon√≠n (near the town Kun≈°t√°t) was constructed later and was opened during December 1940. The camp consisted of several large and small wooden barracks, and were surrounded by a wooden fence. Projected capacity of the camp was 300 people during summer, 200 during winter. New barracks were added later, lifting official capacity to 750 prisoners in 1943. Running water, sewage and electricity infrastructure was planned but never finished. Czech gendarmes (ƒçetn√≠ci) guarded the places (service in such camps was considered a disciplinary punishment). ≈†tefan Blahynka, commander of Hodon√≠n camp. Similar forced labor camps existed in Plan√°, Miro≈°ov, Hradi≈°tko and other places; prisoners were typically used for hard labour such as road construction. In total, around 50,000 people went through such labour camps during the war. The total number of prisons and camps of all kinds within the boundaries of modern-day Czech Republic was 2,125 Franti≈°ek Nedb√°lek, M√≠sta utrpen√≠ a vzdoru, Prague 1984 Situation of Romani people during German occupation Starting in 1940, Romanis were forbidden to travel. In 1942, the measures already in force in Germany were applied in the Protectorate as well and, as an immediate result, a few hundred people deemed \\"asocial\\" were deported to Auschwitz. On June 24, 1942, the Protectorate Minister of the Interior, Richard Bienert, ordered the collection of statistics about \\"Gypsies, mixed Gypsies and people with gypsy style of life\\". Around 6,500 people were recorded in these statistics (based on older records and often on skin color). On July 10, SS-Oberf√ºhrer Horst B√∂hme, Chief of German Security Police, ordered Romanis to be moved into two camps: Lety for Romanies from Bohemia, Hodon√≠n for those from Moravia. Hodon√≠n All pre-existing prisoners at Hodon√≠n were released or transferred, except for seven Romani already imprisoned. During the first month after it was re-opened, 1,229 people arrived. On October 1, 1942, the camp held 205 men, 287 women and 561 children and youths. Internees were assigned to work, typically on construction of local roads; those not performing were beaten. Like in Lety, the food and winter clothing provided was insufficient. On December 7, 1942, 78 \\"asocials\\" were transported to Auschwitz. In December 1942, typhoid started to take its toll in the camp and by the next May, only 5-10% of internees were considered healthy. A lack of medicine to treat the disease, as well as the horrible hygienic conditions, kept the epidemic going for months. On October 21, 1943, 784 prisoners were transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the remaining 62 internees, some were released, and the rest were sent to Auschwitz in 1944. Overall numbers: * Around 1300 prisoners passed through the camp * 207 deaths * 262 released * 67 successfully escaped (those caught were brutally beaten) * 863 deported to Auschwitz Extermination at Auschwitz During the course of the war, a total of 4,831 Romani from the Protectorate were sent to Auschwitz. Of those, few survived. Estimations vary, but well over 4,000 of them died there. Postwar investigations When rumors about atrocities in the camp appeared after the war, Commander Blahynka wrote a statement in 1946 denying any wrongdoings. No official investigation against him had started. Former prisoner Bla≈æej Dydy, acting as Kapo (a supervisor of other prisoners) in Hodon√≠n and Auschwitz, was sentenced to life in prison in 1947 for theft and the murder of other inmates. Forgotten and rediscovered history After the war, the existence of Romani camps was practically forgotten outside the Romani community, except by specialized historians. The whole community of Czech Romani was annihilated and the new ones, who came from Slovakia and Romania, had no knowledge about this tragedy. During the 1970s, a large factory pig farm was constructed near the place of Lety camp. In place of Hodon√≠n camp, a tourist hotel has been built. In 1992 the book Black Silence by Paul Polansky compiled historical records and testimonials of survivors. The book started heated discussions in the Czech Republic about Czech relations to the Romani and their history.

In 2009, he was promoted to the rank of full professor, and in 2010, honored as a scholar of the College of Liberal Arts 2010‚Äì2013. The interdisciplinary significance of Levinson's work has been recognized with appointments to the Institute for Advanced Study (1997); the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin/Berlin Institute for Advanced Study (2007); and to the National Humanities Center (Research Triangle, NC), as the Henry Luce Senior Fellow in Religious Studies (2011 academic year). Bernard Levinson seeks to bring the academic biblical scholarship to the attention of a broader, non-specialist readership In this vein, he has recently written on the impact of the King James Version of the Bible upon the American Founding; drawn attention in the national press to the role of early feminist Bible scholars like Elizabeth Cady Stanton in helping win the vote for women; and, in his attention to language, has been cited in the Oxford English Dictionary. On May 6, 2010, he was elected a fellow of the American Academy for Jewish Research, the oldest professional organization of Judaica scholars in North America. Fellows are nominated and elected by their peers and thus constitute the most distinguished and most senior scholars teaching Judaic studies at American universities. Levinson was at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Hebrew University of Jerusalem during the 2012‚Äì13 academic year. During his time at IAS, he co-directed an international research team on a project titled \\"Convergence and Divergence in Pentateuchal Theory: Bridging the Academic Cultures of Israel, North America, and Europe\\" and co-organized an international conference, which was held on May 12‚Äì13, 2013. The conference featured presentations from a range of scholars and sought to further international exchange and establish a shared intellectual dialogue. More recently, Levinson has co-organized a second international conference at IAS with the title \\"The Pentateuch within Biblical Literature: Formation and Interaction.\\" This upcoming conference, scheduled for May 25‚Äì29, 2014, in Jerusalem, will focus primarily on the formation of the Pentateuch and its interaction with both the prophetic corpus and the historiographic literature of the Hebrew Bible.

It was once the center of the Kingdom of Derge in Kham. History Historically, Derge, which means \\"land of mercy\\", was an important centre of Tibetan culture, along with places such as Lhasa and Xiahe. Derge was formerly the seat of the kings of the kingdom of Derge, whose 1300-year lineage was broken with the death of the last male heir in the 1990s. The kingdom was an important industrial, religious and political center in Eastern Tibet. In the early 20th century, the kingdom fell into political struggle between the final heirs to the throne, Djembel Rinch'en and Doje Senkel. The latter, who had enjoyed the backing of the Chinese, yielded the kingdom to China in 1908 in exchange for the ousting of his rival. The palace of the Derge kings was subsequently converted into a school.McCue, 241. Culture The famous typography of Derge, Sichuan, China, photographed by italian writer Mario Biondi in July 2009 The town of Derge is famous for its three-storey printing house, or the parkhang associated to the , built in 1729, where the Kangyur, a collection of Buddhist scriptures, and the Tengyur, a collection of commentaries, are still printed from wooden blocks. It was established during the reign of Derge king Tenpa Tsering. Derge has produced artists such as the Situ Panchen, the 8th Tai Situpa who was a renowned Buddhist master who helped revive Tibetan culture and language, and aided King Tenpa Tsering in setting up the Derge Parkhang or Derge printing house. The printing house, which is administered by the Religious Affairs Bureau, continues to use its ancient techniques, and utilizes no machines in the printing process. It has been estimated that the 217,000 blocks stored at Derge comprise 70% of the Tibetan literary heritage. The Derge editions are considered especially high quality, with few typographical errors. Derge printing house in 2015 Derge County contains several historic Tibetan monasteries, notably Palpung Monastery, Gongchen Monastery, Kathok Monastery, Palyul Monastery, Shechen Monastery and Dzogchen Monastery.

The dance originated in Liberia or Sierra Leone. The first performance of a version of Fanga in the United States may have been by Asadata Dafora in 1943; Marcia Ethel Heard believes that Pearl Primus hid Dafora's influence on her work. The dance was written by Primus in 1959 in conjunction with the National Dance Company of Liberia. Fanga was one of the dances through which Primus sought to stylize and perpetuate African dance traditions by framing dance as a symbolic act, an everyday practice, and a ceremony. It was then further popularized by Primus' students, sisters Merle Afida Derby and Joan Akwasiba Derby. Babatunde Olatunji described Fanga as a dance of welcome from Liberia and he, and many others, used a song created by LaRouque Bey to go with the rhythm and dance, assisted by some of the students in his Harlem studio, during the early sixties. Bey used words from the Yoruba and Vai languages (alafia = welcome; ashe = so be it; fanga = drum) and an African American folk melody popularized by American minstrels (Li'l Liza Jane).

The majority of the mound was built from 1200-1400 CE. The site has the largest mound of the Caddoan Mississippian culture (a regional variation of the Mississippian culture). It measures approximately in length, wide, and in height. Four low rises at the site are believed also to have been constructed earthwork mounds. Many burial grounds, occupation areas, and other mound sites in the area may be connected with this site. Minor investigations were conducted at the site by Dr. Alex D. Krieger of the University of Texas at Austin and his assistant Mr. Lynn E. Howard, between June 25 and September 11, 1948. The field notes and a full analysis of the excavation have not been published. In recent years archaeologist Duncan P.

Plot summary  Hester Prynne has a child out of wedlock and refuses to name the father (who is a respected citizen). For this, she is sentenced to wear a red letter \\"A\\" (for adultery). Her husband is long missing and presumed dead. When the husband returns and finds his wife with another man's child, he sets out to torture them.

[and] many sets in this lower-budget production seem to be borrowed from the Seastrom film...‚Äù Under the influence of the recently re- imposed Production Code, director Vignola emphasized the guilt-ridden ordeal of the novel‚Äôs protagonists, which resonated with Hollywood censor‚Äôs preference for a depiction of ‚Äúthe moral failure of the central figures‚Äù as a cautionary tale, distinguish it from the Seastrom‚Äôs decidedly romantic film adaption.Malcolm, 2004: ‚Äú...this adaption, perhaps in response to the recently re-constituted Production Code, underscores the moral failure of the central sinners‚Ä¶[and] serves to highlight the realism of the film‚Äôs dialogue.‚Äù It was shot in Sherman Oaks, California. It was the only film Colleen Moore ever said she made for the money. She was reportedly preparing to take her dollhouse on tour for charity, and saw the film as an opportunity to make a last film with friends.

Natural Monument #386 Natural Monuments #386 Cheongsilbae is an extremely rare pear tree species endemic to Korea known only to exist at Eunsusa. The age of this tree at Eunsusa is believed to be about 650 years old. Cheongsilbae stands 18 meters/59 feet in height and 2.8 meters/9.2 feet in circumference. This variation is a blue thread colored mountain stone shaped pear tree that would grow near a house or on mountain. The leaf is saw-toothed with an oval tip and both sides of this strongly structured leaf are smooth. The fruit starts out brown or green in color but changes to yellow as it ripens later in the fall. Cheongsilbae at Eunsusa was planted as a seed by Yi Seonggye, King Taejo in Joseon, at this site to commemorate where he prayed in Maisan. The local people are very proud of the legend of Cheongsilbae's origins. Cheongsilbae is protected as, and designated as, a Natural Monument due to the scientific value and to assure preservation of species.

From here it flows initially northwest and through the woods of the Dreiherren Wald. The valley of the Olef forms the state border here which runs along the river. From its confluence with the Wiesbach it enters Germany. It then forms inter alia, the eastern boundary of the safety zones of the Elsenborn Military Training Area. The river course changes direction in a wide arc to head east. In the next section the Olef flows through the Schleiden Forest (Forst Schleiden) and is impounded to create the Olef Reservoir in front of Hellenthal. In Hellenthal it is joined from the right and southwest by the Plati√übach. At the end of the village of Hellenthal, near Kirschseiffen, the river turns north.

At first it was produced by Steyr for the Dutch, but after 1904, production took place under license at Hembrug Zaandam in the Netherlands. Although often regarded as being based on the earlier Mannlicher 1893 Model, the rifle is in fact a modification of the Mannlicher rifle by August Schriever and the Dutch rifle commissionNederlandse Vuurwapens: Landmacht en Luchtvaartafdeling, drs G. de Vries & drs B.J. Martens, p.40-56. The Dutch issued about 470,000 M.95s. Both Dutch and Romanian rifles fired the same rimmed cartridge often referred to as \\"Romanian\\" 6.5x53.5mmR or \\"Dutch 6.5\\" 6.5√ó53 mmR. In military service, Dutch M.95 rifles (6.5√ó53 mmR) cartridges are loaded primarily through the use of an en-bloc clip, similar in concept to the clip used later by the US Army's M1 Garand. With the Ferdinand Mannlicher designed trigger guard / magazine housing assembly, when the bolt is open and fully retracted to the rear the full en-bloc clip is loaded into the magazine from the top through the open receiver. The empty clip will fall out through a hole in the base of the magazine housing when out of cartridges. This enabled quick reloading of the rifles during combat. When the bolt is in the fully open and retracted position, full clips can be vigorously ejected upwards from the magazine housing by means of a spring loaded latch at the rear of the magazine. This is operated by a recessed button in the front of the trigger guard portion of the assembly. The clips were essentially disposable as ammunition would be issued already loaded into clips from the factory. This same cartridge in the early Imperial (English) nomenclature called the .256 Mannlicher also saw limited success as a sporting round, including use by the elephant hunter W. D. M. Bell. History In the 1880s, two important developments took place that disrupted the current armament paradigm: the adoption of repeating ( i.e. magazine) rifles, and the invention of smokeless gunpowder. On 23 February 1886, the Dutch Minister of War appointed a \\"commission for the purpose of evaluating the rifle question\\", which was tasked with gathering information on the new system of repeating rifles. As the matter of finding a new rifle was regarded a long term goal, the immediate adoption of a magazine rifle was also considered. By 1888, the Dutch Beaumont rifle was modified with a 4-round Vitali magazine, to serve as an interim solution to \\"the rifle question\\". With regards to adopting a new rifle, the commission utilised two principles: The rifle had to have been adopted or at least been considered for adoption by other nations, and the commission would focus on the barrel, bolt, and cartridge of the system. A further question was the inclusion of a magazine cut-off device, allowing the weapon to be used as a single-shot rifle, much like the Beaumont-Vitali M71/88 just adopted. In 1890, the chief of the General Staff and the Inspector of the Infantry allowed the commission to ignore the magazine cut-off function, allowing the rifle to be a \\"pure\\" repeater. Nine rifles using a clip system of loading were trialled: the Austrian Mannlicher 1886, the Italian Vinci rifle, a so-called Bergman rifle, a Belgian Nagant rifle, an improved Belgian Pieper rifle, the Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen rifle, a Swiss Frey rifle made by the Neuhausen factory, the German Gewehr 1888 rifle, and an improved Mannlicher rifle of the August Schriever factory of Li√©ge, Belgium. The latter had his own firearms factory, in addition to being an agent of the Oesterrreichishe Waffenfabriks Gesellschaft Steyr. Some rifles were immediately disqualified: The Vinci rifle was provided with too little ammunition for testing; the German rifle was provided without any ammunition at all. It was recommended to create a rifle from the best elements of those rifles provided, with the August Schriever Mannlicher rifle being the preferred base rifle. At the final moment however, the Nagant firm submitted a new and improved rifle, using a Mauser style stripper clip. It was thus decided to trial both rifles, and by the end of November 1890, both manufacturers were asked to provide the necessary rifles for a large scale trial. Both manufacturers agreed to provide the rifles, at the exorbitant price of 155 Dutch guilders. Following further small scale trials, the commission decided to focus on three rifles: the German 1888, the August Schriever modified Mannlicher, and the Nagant rifle. As ammunition for the German 1888 was finally acquired in December 1890, the weapon was subjected to trials, and subsequently removed from consideration: it was possible to cause a double-feed with the German 1888 rifle, resulting in the tip of the rear cartridge's bullet hitting the chambered cartridge's primer, with catastrophic results. Although the commission initially focused on a calibre of 7.5 to 8 millimetres, a Schriever rifle with an Italian barrel chambered for 6.5 mm was also trialled. As the commission concluded no downsides to the 6.5 cartridge in comparison to a trialled 7.65mm cartridge, 6.5mm was given preference due to its lower weight. As the Mannlicher style of loading was preferred, the matter was almost settled, with the Schriever modified Mannlicher being the preferred candidate. In March 1892, a draft contract for 100 rifles was submitted to the Minister of War for his approval. At this moment, the issue of carry method was raised. Was the weapon to be carried with slings, and if so, how? After deciding on a German style of sling and sling attachment, the question of a hand guard was raised. Following small changes to the stock and barrel bands, this issue too was settled. Finally, small adjustments were made to the sight and other small parts, until the weapon was officially designated the Geweer M.95 on 4 December 1895. The rifle was the standard weapon of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) until the Japanese invasion. M.95 rifles were later used by both sides during the Indonesian National Revolution. After the conclusion of the war, the remaining rifles were handed over by the KNIL to the new Indonesian armed forces. The M. 95 remained in Dutch colonial service at least to 1955, where it was in use by the police force of Suriname. Variants Nine variants were produced, these were largely carbines differing only in sling swivels. These included : *Karabijn No.1 Oud Model (\\"old model\\")(introduced in 1896)Nederlandse Vuurwapens: Landmacht en Luchtvaartafdeling, drs G. de Vries & drs B.J.

It later became the official carbine of the KNIL (Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger, Royal Netherlands East Indies Army) in 1911 (1925 for the non-European units in Java). *Karabijn No.2 for the Koninklijke Marechaussee (Royal Military Constabulary Corps) with a knife bayonet. *Karabijn No.3 pioneer and artillery carbine model *Karabijn No.4, a shortened M.95 (designed in 1909) created for the Dutch bicycle troops that had a wooden fairing on the left side of the magazine. *M.95 Loopgraafgeweer (\\"trench gun\\"), a Periscope rifle version of the M.95, designed in 1916 for trench warfare. Around 1930, new models (Nieuw Model) of the No.1, No.2, No.3 and No.4 were introduced. In 1936 a shorter No.5 carbine model was introduced. It was a Geweer M95 cut down to carbine size. The first 9,500 were issued to field artillery and anti-aircraft artillery. A total 35,500 were rebuilt in all. Beutewaffen designations After Germany occupied the Netherlands, its captured weapons (beutewaffen) were catalogued for German use. G stands for Gewehr (\\"Rifle\\"), Gr.

The train was a part of a maritime rail system that carried mail and passengers from London to Calcutta (and on to Rangoon) by a mix of ships and trains. Passengers traveled by train from London to Brindisi in Italy, then by boat from Brindisi to Bombay's Ballard Pier where they could directly board the Imperial India Mail for a 40-hour journey to Howrah. Passengers heading to Rangoon could transfer to a steamer after a short boat ride from the rail station at Howrah to the pier at Outram Ghat. The train was featured in a 1939 film of the same title starring Noor Jehan and Gulzar. In E. M. Forster's novel, A Passage to India, the train that Mrs. Moore and Adela Quested took to get to Chandrapore was, most likely, the Imperial Indian Mail. History In the 1890s, there was a single mail train operating between Bombay and Howrah running through Jabalpur and Allahabad, now Prayagraj. This train connected with several other mail trains at important stations along the route, providing a through connection to Bombay and also conveyed the English mail between the two cities. However the train was mainly intended for passenger traffic and it was not possible to expedite the delivery of the outbound mail to England, as the train's schedule was constrained by the connecting trains and passenger demands. From 1897, the East Indian Railway and the Great Indian Peninsular Railway operated special trains to facilitate quick movement of the English mail from Bombay / Mumbai to Calcutta / Kolkata. The special trains connected directly with the mail steamers at Bombay and also carried a limited number of First Class passengers, completing the journey to Howrah in 43 hours. In 1908, the special train was replaced with a new service called the Overland Express. Similar services were operated to Madras and Peshawar. The Imperial Indian Mail was the most well known edition of these Postal special trains and commenced operations in November 1926. Operation The Imperial Indian Mail was the name given to two trains, one operated by the East Indian Railway and the other by the Great Indian Peninsular Railway in connection with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. The weekly service departed from the Ballard Pier Mole railway station in Bombay on Fridays about 7 hours after the inbound steamer was signaled. As the steamer's schedule was unfixed, the train's time of departure was varied accordingly. In the return journey for the outbound mail and passengers, the train departed from Calcutta on Thursdays, reaching Bombay on Saturdays, pulling into Ballard Pier beside the outbound steamer. The time taken for the journey from Ballard Pier to Calcutta was 40 hours 13 minutes, and the return journey was completed in 37 hours 39 minutes. The service commenced operations from November 1926 with the East Indian Railway's train departing from Howrah on 4 November 1926 and the Great Indian Peninsular Railway's train departing from Ballard Pier on 5 November 1926. Due to the washing out of a bridge on the Narmada river between Itarsi and Jabalpur in September 1926, the service initially operated through a longer route, going through Bhopal, Bina and Katni till 31 May 1928, when a new bridge was opened and the train was rerouted through Jabalpur. For most of its operational service, it was the fastest train in the Indian subcontinent. Unlike the regular mail train which called at Allahabad/Prayagraj, the Imperial mail skipped Allahabad, going through Prayagraj Cheoki Junction railway station. A shuttle service was operated between Prayagraj and Cheoki as a connecting train. Rolling Stock The service was the most luxurious service to operate in the Indian subcontinent with accommodation only for 32 First class passengers and their servants. The passengers were accommodated in 14 two berth and 4 single berth sleeping compartments. This service also marked the first time in India that bedding, cushions, blankets and other bedroom equipment were provided to the passengers. Hitherto, passengers had to carry their own valise and bedroom requirements. The train operated by the East Indian Railway consisted of a mail van, two sleeping cars with 7 two berth compartments in each, a dining and parlor car, a sleeping, guard and luggage car and a car for the kitchen, servants, luggage and brake. Each carriage was painted blue and the interiors had a polished Teak finish. The single-berth passenger compartments and some of the two-berth compartments (those that had a lower and an upper berth) were provided with wardrobes and washstands. The train operated by the Great Indian Peninsular Railway had a similar composition for the passenger coaches. However, the carriages were upholstered in blue leather with blue silk brocades for the windows. The exterior was painted olive grey with blue and gold moldings with the coat of arms of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, the East Indian Railway and the P&O; company emblazoned on the sides. The train was hauled by the HPS class locomotives over the East Indian railway, and GIPR EA/1 class electric locomotives till Igatpuri on the Great Indian Peninsular railway. Current Status For all of its operational service, the Imperial Indian mail the daily Kolkata-Mumbai mail which had been in service ever since the opening of the rail link between Jabalpur and Allahabad. In 1939, at the onset of world war II, the Imperial mail was discontinued for an indefinite duration. The service was resumed after the Independence of India in 1947. The regular mail service, is however still in operation and runs as the Howrah - Mumbai Mail (via Gaya-Jabalpur) numbered 12321/22. This train is still referred to as the Imperial mail.

Silliman reported, in his new American Journal of Science, that he had identified tungsten, tellurium, topaz and fluorite. Shortly after the articles were published, Ephraim Lane was making specimens available to collectors at a price and apparently to protect his supply of minerals, Lane acquired a lease to in Trumbull later to be known as \\"Shagamywamps the mine lot\\" in 1828 from Elijah Hawley.History and Minerals of Old Mine Park (Saganawamps), Earle Sullivan, Trumbull Historical Society, 1985, p. 8 Lane then leased the land to Thomas R. Hubbard. In 1837 the first (and at the time only) prismatic barite ore of tungsten in the United States was discovered at the mine. It was scientifically studied in 1887 by Adolph Gurlt of the University of Bonn. The area has previously been mined for copper, silver, lead and gold as well as limestone. The Hubbard Mine for tungsten was operated by the Rare Minerals Company from 1898 and later by the American Tungsten Mining and Milling Company, ceasing operations after a fire in 1916.http://www.trumbullhistory.org/oldmines/ Besides tungsten, the mine was also a source of beryl, opal, topaz, tourmaline and 60 other crystals and minerals in varying quantities.http://www.mindat.org/loc.php?loc=23342&ob;=4 Later on the site was demolished and a Home Depot was built nearby, many of the same crystals and minerals were found on this site.

The \\"dice throw\\" () is a method of review which is often used in Norway and occasionally in Sweden. It is characterized by the use of a white-on-red die graphic to represent the movie's rating in the review, and is similar to stars or letters used in other countries. The format was introduced by film director and then-film critic Arne Skouen, who, writing for Verdens Gang on 31 March 1952, stated the need of \\"having a film premi√®re characterized in a short, concise form\\". To do this, he used a standard die with six pips, where one marked the lowest possible rating of a film, and six marked the highest. In some cases, a die with zero pips has been used, meaning awful. Similarly, people sometimes allude to \\"seven pips\\", meaning extraordinarily good. Usage In time, the dice throw spread to other parts of the media. It is used by about forty Norwegian newspapers, numerous magazines and television shows for review purposes. An analysis in 2002 found dice throws in 41 out of 254 daily newspapers in Norway. Secondly, it was used to characterize several other products than films. Even people have been reviewed with \\"throws of the dice\\", for instance to grade the achievements of a political officeholder. It has also been used for blurbing, as a quick, graphic way of expressing the worthiness of a product. Writer Ari Behn gained some note when he, after receiving a favourable dice throw review with six pips, tattooed the dice on his upper arm for maximum exposure. At times, companies who use dice throws for blurbs have been caught cheating, in that they claim positive dice throw reviews which do not exist. According to a 2005 master's thesis at the University of Bergen it is very seldom used outside of Norway, an exception being the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. The dice throw coincides with the grading system in Norwegian schools (excluding higher education), where 1 is the lowest and 6 is the highest grade. This grading system was not in use when the dice throw review was introduced; it was introduced later. Misuse In 1998, the newspapers Verdens Gang, Dagbladet and Aftenposten brought legal charges against Nettavisen for extracting dice throws from reviews and reprinting it. The three newspapers argued that this was an abuse of their reviews, since the dice was taken out of context, and won the case in Oslo City Court.Eknes, 2005: p. 90 In 2002, Verdens Gang wanted to add their own touch to the dice throw review, which they had created, and added the newspaper's logo to the dice graphic.

The episode was written by co-executive producer Ron Weiner and directed by series producer Don Scardino. It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on February 4, 2010. Former SNL cast member Jan Hooks guest stars as the title character of this episode. In the episode, Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) mother Verna (Hooks) comes to visit her, and Jenna turns to Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) for help. At the same time, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) moves in with Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) temporarily, and they both decide to make a pact to give up their bad habits. \\"Verna\\" has received generally positive reception from television critics. According to the Nielsen ratings, the episode was watched by 5.93 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.9 rating/8 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) learns that her mother, Verna (Jan Hooks), has come to visit her. Jenna does not want to see Verna, though, as she knows that her visit will lead to her asking Jenna for money, so Jenna turns to her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), for help. Jack, who also does not get along with his mother Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch), shows Jenna a presentation on how to deal with overbearing mothers. Jenna attempts to follow the presentation, but Verna surprises her by giving her back the money she has borrowed from Jenna and wanting to be in her life again, leading to Jenna ignoring what Jack has told her and reconciling with Verna, making Jack convinced that Verna has an ulterior motive for making amends with Jenna. Later, his suspicions come true when Verna admits that she sneaked her way back into Jenna's life solely to convince her to star in a reality show featuring them both. Jack tries to let Jenna know Verna's true intentions but cannot bring himself to tell Jenna as she is so happy. Instead, Jack pays Verna off to visit Jenna on a regular basis, letting Jenna believe her mother has changed her ways. At the same time, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) takes her staff writer, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) in as a roommate, and they both decide to make a pact to give up their bad habits: Liz eating junk food and Frank's smoking. As they continue living together, Liz is having a hard time adjusting to not eating junk food and suspects that Frank is still smoking, due to his calm behavior during the situation. To catch him in the act, she decides to hide a recording video camera equipped with night vision in her apartment. The next day, Liz shows the video to her staff writers, including Frank. However, instead of showing Frank smoking cigarettes, the footage shows Liz sleepwalking, \\"sleepeating,\\" ordering pizza in her sleep, eating large amounts of junk food, and eating the cigarettes. However, it also shows Frank having an affair with a much older cleaning lady, whom he calls \\"mommy,\\" thus embarrassing them both and breaking the pact. A subplot involves Pete not being able to have a moment alone at work because of Kenneth continuously talking to him. However, Pete ultimately finds a release by entering a fight club with homeless people and is able to tolerate Kenneth's jabbering. Production \\"Verna\\" was written by co- executive producer Ron Weiner and directed by series producer Don Scardino. This episode was Weiner's sixth writing credit, having penned \\"Secrets and Lies\\", \\"Se√±or Macho Solo\\", \\"Goodbye, My Friend\\", \\"Mamma Mia\\", and \\"The Problem Solvers\\". This was Scardino's twenty-fifth directed episode. \\"Verna\\" originally aired in the United States on February 4, 2010, on NBC, as the twelfth episode of the show's fourth season and the 70th overall episode of the series. This episode of 30 Rock was filmed on December 7, 2009. Save Picture as ‚Üí Right click file ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Date Picture Taken Comedian-actress Jan Hooks, best known for appearing on Saturday Night Live and 3rd Rock from the Sun, guest-starred as Verna Maroney, the mother of Jenna Maroney, played by Jane Krakowski. She reprised her role as Verna in the May 6, 2010, episode \\"The Moms\\". Hooks is eleven years older than Krakowski. Some television commentators have noted that Hooks's appearance on 30 Rock was her first acting job since appearing in the 2004 comedy movie Jiminy Glick in Lalawood. The episode opens with Liz Lemon having a dream in which she is married to Jack Donaghy and is giving birth to their child. Since its beginning, the series has occasionally hinted at a romantic relationship between Liz and Jack. In one episode, Jack passes Liz off as his live-in girlfriend to his ex-wife to make her jealous. In another episode, Jack's mother tells him that Liz is a perfect match for him, and in the same episode he has Liz listed as his emergency contact. In an April 2010 Esquire interview, series creator Tina Fey said that one of the plots the show will never do is have Liz and Jack get together. \\"Let me put the Internet at ease: Liz and Jack will never be together.\\" Alec Baldwin was asked if the two characters will ever hook up; he responded \\"I sincerely doubt it, and I think the show is better off that way. Once they cross that line, all the tension goes out of those relationships. And I think the lesson we learned about both those characters is that they are married to their jobs and they are married to their work.\\" Cultural references In the beginning of the episode, Liz dreams she is giving birth to Meat Cat, a fictional cartoon mascot for \\"cheesy blasters\\", her favorite cheese snacks. This episode made reference to the mascot as it was first introduced in the fourth season's premiere episode \\"Season 4\\". Many television reviewers have noted that Jack's presentation on how to deal with overbearing mothers, given the acronym \\"ASQ\\" (Always Speak Quietly), was a reference to Baldwin's \\"ABC\\" (Always Be Closing) speech seen in the film Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). The night vision video that Liz shows to her writing staff, in which she is seen sleepwalking, ordering a pizza and eating large amounts of junk food, was a parody of the 2009 horror film Paranormal Activity. Reception According to the Nielsen ratings system, \\"Verna\\" was watched by 5.93 million households in its original American broadcast. The rating was a 7 percent increase in viewership from the previous week's episode, \\"Winter Madness\\", which was seen by 5.585 million American viewers. The show claimed a 2.9 rating/8 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, meaning that it was seen by 2.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. TV Squad's Bob Sassone enjoyed Jan Hooks' appearance, and said that her role as Jenna's mother was \\"good casting.\\" His only complaint was that this episode had nothing to do with The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan, the fictional show on 30 Rock, and hoped that no other characters have to stay at Liz's apartment. \\"Laughter wasn't constant during ['Verna'], but the direction it moved in kept interest even when jokes were sparse. That being said, some of the material ... were pretty great by even the show's lofty standards\\", said Paste magazine's Sean Gandert. In his recap, Adam Mersel for TV Guide was complimentary, writing it had \\"spot-on one-liners, witty pop culture references, and a hilarious guest-star in Jan Hooks\\", and that \\"Verna\\" became his favorite episode of the season. Nick Catucci for New York magazine liked Liz and Frank's plot, noting that their bad habits featured here \\"culminated in the greatest few moments the show has had in some time.\\" The A.V. Club‚Äôs Nathan Rabin enjoyed this episode of 30 Rock, writing that the show \\"was firing on all cylinders. It was good for laughs aplenty but it also helped illuminate Jack's paternal relationship with Jenna, the source of some of Jenna's narcissistic craziness and the full measure of Jack's Oedipal hell.\\" Margaret Lyons for Entertainment Weekly deemed \\"Verna\\" a solid episode from the show. Time contributor James Poniewozik enjoyed Hooks' performance, and that it was good to see Jane Krakowski's Jenna \\"get a story that was not solely about her being an insecure ninny.\\" Not all reviews were positive. IGN contributor Robert Canning gave the episode a 7.9 out of 10 rating, and said that Hooks' role as Jenna's mother \\"helped the half hour, but this Jenna- centric episode still didn't blow me away.\\" He noted that the main plot had funny moments but \\"there wasn't much else to invest in.\\" Overall, Canning reasoned that this episode was very much a stand-alone one \\"built for some good jokes, and not exactly focused on storytelling. [...] An episode like 'Verna' can still bring a lot of laughs, but you can't help but feel like it's missing that extra something.\\" Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger disliked both stories from \\"Verna\\", and wrote that it was a disappointing episode, and that it was \\"pretty weak overall.\\" Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times, reported that despite Hooks' hilarious performance, the episode still felt a \\"little bit like filler\\", and that there \\"wasn't too much that was especially funny or memorable about it\\".

ERI unsuccessfully applied for a commercial licence in the area in 1989 under the name 'Sound of the South'. Subsequently, its studio and transmission facilities were leased to a new licensed station, the then 'Radio South' in 1989, allowing this new station to come on air relatively quickly. Radio South was relaunched in July 1990 as 96FM and eventually bought out by County Sound in February 1991 with the original 4 shareholders selling all their shares to the Mallow based station. WKLR & NCCR Outside of Cork city in County Cork, the two most significant stations during the 1980s were the Bandon-based WKLR, and NCCR (North Cork Community Radio), which broadcast from the old Majestic Ballroom in Mallow. WKLR (West Cork Local Radio) founded in 1984, initially intended for the West Cork area, but towards the end of the station's life had extended its transmission to cover Cork city and much of the rest of Co. Cork. The close-down night of NCCR in Mallow on 31 December 1988 was struck by tragedy, when local farmer and former presenter and shareholder of the station - Pat O'Connor - who was participating in an interview - collapsed and died suddenly during a commercial break. The station immediately announced it was closing earlier than planned \\"due to unforeseen circumstances\\". Pat O'Connor had also been a brief national celebrity was he was chosen as a representative of rural Ireland to guest present an edition of the 'Saturday Live' chat show on RT√â TV in 1987, however his RT√â appearance meant he had to resign his involvement in the pirate NCCR to avoid controversy beforehand, and did not appear on NCCR again until the closedown night. NCCR had come into being in 1985 when a community co-operative took over the ownership of a previous station ‚Äì NCLR (North Cork Local Radio) that had been in existence since 1981. RADIO CAROLINE CORK This long-running Cork station formed in 1981 and launched on Cork's airwaves on 22nd of May same air started its life broadcasting from a ground-floor apartment in Togher on Cork's southside on 98.8 FM, moving on later in 1982 to an upstairs studios in Cornmarket Street for a few weeks before returning later to a mobile home studios based back in Togher and adding a mW transmitter to its transmission side on 253 AM, later changing the frequency to 1557 kHz or 194 mW. A lot of well-known names in broadcasting today passed through its studio doors down over the years, moving on later in life to carve out careers on local and national radio and TV. Dave Hammond, the founder, is still involved in its running up to this present day. Contents Community Radio Youghal Another well remembered pirate station in County Cork was Community Radio Youghal (CRY), whose existence, (like NCLR in Mallow) was ironically inspired by a stint in the town of RT√â's mobile community radio station (which provided temporary community radio services during visits to dozens of towns nationwide in the 1980s). CRY had been on air for almost a decade and was one of the longest surviving pirates in Ireland when it closed at the end of 1988. CRY returned to the airwaves 7 years later in 1995 with a licence, and currently broadcasts on 104.0 MHz to Youghal town and surrounding areas from a 25 Watt transmitter located on the town's water tower at Cork Hill. Radio Friendly The 1990s also saw the birth of one of Cork's most memorable pirate stations, Radio Friendly. Radio Friendly provided Corkonians with music from the \\"Underground\\" DJs of Cork, some from the infamous Sir Henry's nightclub at the time and its DJs included Stevie G and Greg & Shane of Fish Go Deep. The station got its name from its owners MR P, Miss Ken D and some Djs from Dublin's Power FM. The original transmitter was the original Power 98.7FM equipment. Radio Friendly for most of its existence was on 104.6FM but moved to 104.0FM in late 2001 until its closure in 2003 - Radio Friendly won the Best Irish Dance station award beating all the national stations at the Smirnoff Irish Dance awards. Kiss 105.5 Fm Another big station in the late 1990s early 2000s was Kiss 105.5FM which had a more commercial side than Radio Friendly and was aimed at a younger audience, such DJs such as Colin Edwards, Damien Sreenan, Dave Newman and Derek O Keefe were regulars on this, it closed down in 2001. Kiss actually first appeared on 105.3FM, but moved to 105.5 some months later after they extended coverage. They later introduced another transmitter for the north Cork area on 107.1 lasting until it broke down. Kiss 106.5/94.8/87.8/88.7/104.9  Kiss (previously called NRG 2003-04) started on 106.5 in April 2004 by Pete O'Neill who also owned NRG and fronted by Colin Edwards and were on air for over 6 months, then were raided, Kiss had their name built and was very popular to the younger audience of Cork. One of the reasons this happened was the large Max Power Event that was advertised on the station. There were hundreds of cars and thousands of people in attendance. There was a car crash on the road near Douglas. This was attributed to the station and therefore was closed down. The Evening Echo carried the story in 2 pages and this worried some stations. The other station's presenters then complained from the point of view of ratings. Hence why they switched frequencies due to the fact they were to be close to that other station's frequency. This was the main pirate station in Cork and was more known on Kiss 94.8, but they have been the subject of much Comreg attention and have been raided three times having broadcasting equipment confiscated. The station also featured many big DJs including Simon Murdoch (I Radio) DJ Bounce, Jerry Coughlan (Red FM), DJ Redzer (96FM & Red FM),Damien Sreenan, Chris Curtis (Red FM), Steve Nation, Colin Edwards (funky colin voiceovers), Scratchy, Brody, Midge, Roy Shaw, Podge, James K, Donal K, Jason Barry, . In 2007 the owner of Kiss launched a second station Play 87.7FM which broadcast house, techno & trance music and remained on air for a year. A 2008 relaunch of Kiss 94.8 lasted only 3 weeks with the station being raided once again (13/08/2008 13:00) and all equipment was confiscated while off air. This is believed to be due to the popularity of the station which poses a financial threat to other licensed broadcasters in the area and also it was said that their equipment was worth about ‚Ç¨20000. Kiss made another return to 88.7 for 2 months and closed due to the fact of another station that they were going joining with.[NRG887] They then separated and the old kiss members surprisingly made a return once again (24/06/2012) to the airwaves on 104.9Mhz for a period of time before suddenly disappearing from the airwaves (Nov 1st 2013) and has not reappeared. Kiss FM's last website was at www.kisscork.com  NRG 88.7 Fm NRG 88.7MHZ Tied from the old NRG 106.5 and Kiss 106.5/94.8 and linked with the owners of the old Pulse 106.5 & Galaxy FM to create NRG 88.7MHZ. Later the Kiss owner separated and once again brought Kiss FM back to the airwaves on 104.9FM, while NRG was still being run on 88.7Mhz by the old Pulse & Galaxy Fm owner but was on and off the air due to equipment issues. Website was as www.nrg887.com but is no longer active.

Rock, Metal, Indie, Soul, Funk, Reggae, eclectic were some of the genres of shows The station continued until December 2005 when Comreg raided two of the transmitter sites, the main studio was not raided and the station continued for 1 more week until permanent shutdown 31 December 2005.

Maciel started his football career in his native Brazil with Londrina Esporte Clube at the youth level. Afterward, he moved to North America specifically to the United States to pursue college soccer with Quinnipiac University. Later he signed with the Western Mass Pioneers, where he spent his entire career playing in the USL Second Division. He was part of the club's regular-season championship-winning team, in which he led Western to the playoff finals. Over the years he would continue to receive All-League recognition, winning All-League honors for four consecutive years. He holds the distinction of being one of only six players in the league‚Äôs history to receive the honor four times. In February 2010, he was ranked 9th in the USL Second Division Top 15 of the Decade, which announced a list of the best and most influential players of the previous decade. Playing career Maciel began playing football at the youth level in Brazil with Londrina Esporte Clube. During his time with Londrina he held position of captain for four seasons. His lists of achievements during his tenure there is winning the First Dourados Tournament, Foz do Iguacu Juniors, Monte Alegre de Minas Tournament and the Campeonato Paranaense. In 1997, Maciel debuted for the Londrina Esporte Club senior team and played there till 1999. In 2000 Maciel went abroad to the United States to enroll at Quinnipiac University. At Quinnipiac, Maciel is ranked among the leaders all-time at Quinnipiac as he is tied for second in goals scored with 31, and third in career points. His list of accomplishments at Quinnipiac is being named the Northeast Conference Player of the Year, and the Quinnipiac Male Athlete of the Year during the 2001-02 season. He was also named to the All-NEC First Team on two occasions. In 2003, he signed with Negeri Sembilan in Malaysia where he won the FA Cup scoring the winning goal at first overtime. Playing for Negeri Everson scored 12 goals and had 14 assists. In 2004, he came back to the US and was signed by the Western Mass Pioneers where he had a successful rookie season, despite the fact the Pioneers failed to reach the postseason. He recorded six goals and added two assists, which earned him into USL Second Division All-League team. In the 2005 season he led the club to its first Regular Season Championship, while tallying five goals and recording four assists throughout the season. He was named into second All-League team for the second consecutive time. During the club's playoff run Maciel helped bring the Pioneers back twice in the two-game aggregate score series against Wilmington Hammerheads, scoring both equalizers in the second leg after a 1-0 loss on the road in the opener, sending the club to its second championship game appearance on a 3-2 aggregate victory. In the finals match the Pioneers faced the Charlotte Eagles, where the game finished as a 2-2 draw which brought the match into penalties. Unfortunately Western were edged out of the title despite Maciel‚Äôs conversion on his shot. Throughout his tenure with the Pioneers, Maciel would continue on making an impact despite the fact club struggled reach the postseason for two consecutive seasons. For four years straight he was selected into the All-League team. In the 2008 season he helped Western reached the playoffs for the first time in two years. In the quarterfinal match they were defeated by eventual champions Cleveland City Stars by a score of 4-2. Maciel subsequently retired from soccer after his contract expired with the Western. Coaching career In 2005 Maciel founded the Everson Soccer Academy which provides coaching services to local soccer clubs in the New Haven CT area.

Smith. It is used to allocate tasks among autonomous agents. It is close to sealed auctions protocols. It mainly relies on the Subcontractor: a manager proposes a task to several agents. The latter make a proposal among which the manager chooses to allocate the task. This task can then be divided and subcontracted.  Formal description  The formalization of the protocol can be performed through the speech act theory. In this protocol, each agent can be either manager or contractor # The protocol is initialized by the manager, who sends a call-for-proposals to the contractors #The contractors can send either a proposal if they are interested or a reject if they are not. This proposal is provided with all the elements required by the manager to make its choice. #The manager chooses among the proposals the one that suits it best, and sends to the corresponding contractor an accept. It send a reject to the other contractors to inform them of its decision. #Once the contract has been accomplished, the contractor informs the manager using an inform message. If there is a result to communicate, it is also communicated through the inform message. If the contractor cannot fulfill its engagement, it informs the manager through a cancel message. The Contract Net Protocol can be represented using the AUML formalism: Contract Net Protocol AUML Diagram This protocol can be used to implement hierarchical organizations, where a manager assigns tasks to contractors, who in turn decompose into lower level task and assign them to the lower level. This kind of organization can be used when agents are cooperative, i.e. when their objectives are identical. In this situation, it is possible to make sure that the contractors do not lie to the manager when they make their proposal. When the agents are competitive, the protocol ends up in a marketplace organization, very similar to auctions. Implementation The protocol has been implemented by the FIPA in the ACL (Agent Communication Language). The Contract Net Protocol has been implemented for various problems and contexts. The original article describes a sensor network use case. Subsequent work showed its utility in this context. It has also been used for Multi-Robot Task Allocation. It has also been used as a negotiation protocol both for e commerce marketplaces and for supply chains. Issues and extensions Reid G Smith identified several issues related to its protocol. In particular, he proposes to create only short messages, and to interact only with agents that could be relevant to the proposed task in order to avoid overloading the network communication in terms of exchanged messages. In order to limit the number of interactions, in the case where a manager knows with which contractor it would like to contract, it can contact it directly to make an offer, that the contractor can accept or not. A second issue is related to the occupation rate of the contractor when there are many tasks. Indeed, in this case, it may be complicated for the manager to find available contractors. In order to solve this problem, the contractor can answer a call for proposals even if they are already working for another contract. This trick can be used to prevent a situation where the manager makes call for proposals without getting any answer because the contractors are all busy. In this case, the contractors add to their proposal the moment when they'll be ready to seal with the proposal from the manager. Similarly in this situation, it is possible to keep a list of all available contractors so that the manager can contact them first. This trick makes it possible to avoid a network overload due to the managers sending their call for proposals to all the agents over and over again while ensuring that they will eventually find a contractor to contract on the proposed task. This information is directly sent to the managers by the contractors. Beyond extensions proposed by the author, several works have extended the Contract Net Protocol. One of the issues raised by it is the fact that the manager cannot precise what it values most. It must choose among the proposals it receives from the contractors. In the case where each contractor can make a range of proposals, this can lead to suboptimal solutions. To address this issue, the FIPA also proposes an iterated version of the protocol in which the manager can make a new call for proposal some of the contractors that answered it, and refuse others, eventually accepting one of them. The resulting protocol can be compared with the iterated auction protocols. As the CNP, this protocol can be represented as an AUML diagram 622x622px Another issue of the protocol is actually dealing with the task. In the original protocol, a contractor that makes a proposal commits to accomplish the task it has made a proposal on, whatever it takes. The failure of the task is only taken in consideration through the cancel message informing the manager that the task won't be addressed, without any sanction for the contractor. In the case where the agent are selfish, they therefore may have an incentive to make as many proposals as they can, and only fulfill the most profitable ones. In a collaborative context, the agent have no way to know if opting out from a task in order to commit to another one is good for the overall system. An extension of the protocol has been released in 1995 by Tuomas Sandholm and Victor Lesser in order to take these elements into account and define beforehand a commitment cost for the contractor to pay if they cannot accomplish the task.

It was a two-seat, twin-boom aircraft powered by two turboprop engines which lost out to the North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco of similar layout. Only the single prototype Model 48 was built. Design and development In 1959, two United States Marine Corps officers developed the concept of a small low cost aircraft capable of providing close air support to the U.S. Marines, capable of operating from roads close to the battlefield, the concept being known as the Light Light Marine Attack Aircraft (L2VMA). As interest in such an aircraft grew, with interest from the US Army for a similar type, the Convair Division of General Dynamics started studies into counter-insurgency aircraft in 1961. In 1963, the various requirements were merged into a tri-service specification for a Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft (LARA), to be used not just by the U.S. Marines and Army, but also by the United States Air Force for counter- insurgency and forward air control roles, and to be available for export.Willis 2010, pp. 60‚Äì63. Frontal view of the Convair Model 48 Charger. The specification produced responses from nine manufacturers, including Convair, who submitted its Model 48 Charger in March 1964. The Model 48 was a twin-boom monoplane, constructed mainly from aluminium, with fiberglass nose, rear fuselage and wingtips, with a retractable nosewheel undercarriage. It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT-6 (military designation T-74), driving three bladed propellers. Its wings were of relatively short (27 ft 6 in/8.38 m) span, which meant that most of the wing was in the slipstream of the propellers, increasing the effectiveness of the full-span trailing-edge slotted flaps and leading edge slats inboard of the engines, which together acted to deflect the slipstream, giving a form of vectored thrust, in order to reduce takeoff and landing distances.Flight International 14 January 1965, pp. 54‚Äì55.Ginter 1997, p.10. The outer trailing-edge flaps doubled as ailerons, which were supplemented by spoilers at low speed. The aircraft was fitted with a large, all-moving tailplane which attached to the vertical fins located at the ends of the tailboom(s), with the tailplane having somewhat greater span (20 ft (6.1 m)) than the distance between the tailbooms.Ginter 1997, pp. 14‚Äì15.Willis 2010, p. 63. Pilot and observer sat in tandem under a sliding canopy, while the rear fuselage held a cargo bay with a hinged tail cone capable of carrying 2,000 lb (910 kg) of cargo, which could include a complete PT-6 engine, or five paratroopers, in extremely cramped conditions, with a sixth paratrooper in the observer's seat. Four 7.62 mm machine guns were mounted in pods on the side of the fuselage, while 2,000 lb (910 kg) of external stores, including bombs, rockets and gun pods, could be carried on hardpoints under the wings and fuselage. To meet the specification's requirements for amphibious operations, it could be fitted with two large floats.Ginter 1997, pp. 30‚Äì32.Taylor 1965, pp. 231‚Äì232. Operational history Convair started construction of a prototype as a private venture before a winner of the LARA competition was announced. In August 1964, the US Navy announced North American Aviation's design, the NA-300 (later to become the OV-10 Bronco) as the winner of the LARA competition. The U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force favored the Charger, however, and protested against the U.S. Navy's decision, and Convair continued construction of their prototype, which made its maiden flight on 25 November 1964. After initial flight tests, the Charger was modified with an increased wingspan and modified tail to improve low-speed control. The Charger demonstrated excellent STOL capability, taking off over a 50 ft (15 m) obstacle in 485 ft (148 m) with a normal payload. This was better both than the LARA specifications requirement of 800 ft (244 m), and the Bronco.Ginter 1997, p. 44. The Charger was awarded a 100-hour joint service flight test contract where the prototype would be flown by representatives of the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, Army and Air Force. If orders followed, it was planned to build the production aircraft with a deeper and longer fuselage allowing full dual controls to be fitted. The prototype crashed on its 196th test flight on 19 October 1965, owing to pilot error by its U.S. Navy test pilot, however, and further development was abandoned.

It was largely similar to other armies of the region ‚Äì see Ancient Greek warfare.  Army  In the manner of neighboring city-states the backbone of the Athenian military on land was the hoplite. Accompanying every hoplite was a lightly armed attendant, either a poor citizen who could not afford a regular suit of armor (panoplia), or possibly a trusted slave. These attendants carried the hoplite's shield (aspis) until the battle and most of the baggage. While generally armed with javelins, they sometimes had spears, slings or bows. The attendants acted as skirmishers before the pitched battle and were assigned to guard the camp during the actual fight. When the battle was over, they would attempt either to cover the retreat of the main body or slaughter the fleeing enemy forces if their own hoplites were victorious. During and after the Peloponnesian Wars, the use and importance of light troops increased with the introduction of the peltasts: lightly armoured, if at all, and armed with javelins and a shield, the pelte. Their effectiveness in battle, even against the best-trained heavy hoplites, was demonstrated by the Athenian general Iphicrates, who annihilated an entire Spartan mora with his peltasts.  Navy  During the Persian wars Athens developed a large, powerful navy in the eastern Mediterranean that destroyed the even larger Persian Navy at the Battle of Salamis. The Athenian Navy consisted of 80,000 crewing 400 ships. The backbone of the navy's manpower was a core of professional rowers drawn from the lower classes of Athenian society. This gave the Athenian fleets an advantage in training over the less professional fleets of its rivals. The main warships of the fleet were the triremes. With its fleet, Athens obtained hegemony over the rest of the Greek city-states forming the first Athenian Empire. Its fleet was destroyed and empire lost during the Peloponnesian War. Athens regained some of its naval power after the Second Athenian Empire was rebuilt; however, it never fully recovered as its rivals were much stronger than before. The fleet included two sacred ships, the Paralus and the Salaminia used for diplomatic and ceremonial duties.

Early life Clunie was born in the village of Eaglesham in Renfrewshire, Scotland. His father was a professional golfer, golf course designer and gamekeeper on the Gilmore estate. As a child, Clunie began illustrating his school assignments with watercolor paintings, which attracted the attention of a teacher who organized an exhibition of his work which toured area schools. Robert developed an aversion to the social class system then prevalent in Scotland, and decided to emigrate to the United States with his older brother William in 1911. Initially, they settled in Saginaw, Michigan. Several months later, the rest of his family also emigrated to Michigan. He found work as a pin striping artist with A. T. Ferrell Company, which manufactured harvesters for farmers. Meanwhile, his father obtained commissions to design golf courses in Saginaw, Bad Axe and Bridgeport, Michigan.Coons pp. 9 - 14 In 1918, while his employer was on a winter shutdown, Clunie took a train trip to California, and took a temporary job pin striping carriages for the Los Angeles Creamery Company.Coons, pp. 16 He felt at home in Los Angeles, and spent two months exploring the area before returning to Michigan, determined to relocate to California. On his 23rd birthday, June 29, 1918, he applied for U. S. citizenship. It was not until 1939 that he was granted citizenship. On October 29, 1918, he left for California by car with his brother William. It took them one month to reach Los Angeles.Coons pp. 21 - 28 He found work as a set painter for Metro Pictures, later to become part of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, working on the film The Red Lantern. His next job was in the paint department at the American Beet Sugar Company in Oxnard, California. At this time, he planned to travel to Australia. Instead, he met Myrtle Ireland in Oxnard, and they were married on June 20, 1920. His mother died two weeks later. The couple began their married life in Saginaw, and Clunie returned to work at the A. T. Ferrell Company.Coons pp. 29 - 37 During this period, Clunie began pursuing a serious interest in canvas painting. Less than a year later, the couple returned to California, and settled in Santa Paula, Myrtle's home town. He entered into a successful house painting business with a partner, Sam Dunkle, with specialties including gold leaf lettering, wallpaper and faux painting. In 1923, he designed and built a modern new home that incorporated an artist's studio. He continued canvas and easel painting, increasingly concentrating on landscapes. He also became a serious amateur tennis player. His brother William, a pilot, was killed in a plane crash in Flint, Michigan in 1927, which was traumatic as the brothers were very close. In that same year, he left the house painting business to concentrate on fine art.  Early artistic career in Santa Paula, California  In the spring of 1928, he completed his first Sierra Nevada landscape, entitled Olivas Pack Station, a scene in Lone Pine. Mount Whitney towers in the background. On March 13, 1928, Santa Paula was flooded when the St. Francis Dam, owned by the City of Los Angeles, collapsed, killing 600 people and destroying nearly 1200 homes. Clunie returned to house painting temporarily as the town was rebuilt, but still managed to complete 19 paintings that year. Clunie was now developing a distinctive style as a landscape painter, and credited John Ruskin as an influence, especially his book Modern Painter, published in 1881. He was now supporting himself by selling paintings out of his home studio, and brisk sales continued into 1929. He spent the summer of 1929 in the Sierra with his wife, painting in Yosemite National Park and the Mammoth Mountain area, followed by an 8-week stay in the Palisades peaks east of Big Pine. He hired the Glacier Pack Station to move his gear by mule, setting up camp on a knoll between Fourth Lake and Fifth Lake. He completed at least 14 paintings in the Palisades, and had found his artistic home, as he would return to the same campsite about 30 times over the years.Coons, pp. 61 - 76 He met California mountaineer and nature writer Norman Clyde during his 1929 painting trip to the Palisades, and they became lifelong friends. The two men shared an enthusiasm for prolonged wilderness sojourns, and in particular, a love for trout fishing. Clyde's biographer Robert C. Pavlik observed that \\"The two men shared a common philosophy as well. They shared a love of the mountains and each tried, in their own way, to capture the essence of their meaning.\\" Clyde would often visit Clunie's campsite over the years to rest up between ascents, and referred to his camp as \\"The Palace Hotel\\".Coons pp. 70 Twenty-five years later, on September 9‚Äì11, 1954, a severe early-season snowstorm hit the Sierra Nevada, and Clyde and a companion took shelter in Clunie's camp for four days.Coons pp. 200 His 1929 Sierra Nevada paintings were received with great praise, and he sold at least fifteen paintings in the months that followed. The Biltmore Salon in Los Angeles arranged an exhibition of his paintings, and some were included in a group showing at the Stendahl Gallery. Los Angeles Times art critic Arthur Millier said of the paintings at the Biltmore, \\"Mountains are humbly approached by Robert Clunie, a young Santa Paula painter, whose paintings were for the first time shown to a few local critics and dealers in a sample room at the Biltmore. The works displayed made a very favorable impression on this reviewer who believes the artist to have already achieved some splendid Sierra painting, and to be in line to go much further.\\" Millier went on to praise Clunie for his \\"careful observation of nature, a fine feeling for the grandeur of composition presented the artist by the architecture of the Sierras, and an eye for light as the medium that binds together the separate masses seen in nature.\\" A reproduction of a Clunie painting called The Cliff illustrated the article. In the midst of these positive developments in Clunie's career, the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929. In the aftermath, customers canceled orders for paintings, not a single painting sold at the Stendahl Gallery show, and when Clunie went to pick up his unsold paintings, the most praised of them, The Cliff, had somehow been lost by the gallery. In the wake of this bad experience, Clunie decided to never again sell through galleries, and instead sold his work directly to collectors for the rest of his career.Coons pp. 77 - 80 Better news was the birth of his son, Robert Kent Clunie, on November 14, 1929. Clunie joined the California Art Club and the Painters and Sculptors Club, giving him an opportunity to exhibit his work outside of commercial galleries. The Los Angeles Times again praised his work on December 21, 1930, observing \\"for Robert Clunie the crags stand still with the utter stillness of hard granite while he paints the deep shadow tones of granite above a blue pool cut by the gold of a sand bar. In another canvas by him they thrust sharply into the sky, jostling each other in the impestuous force of upheaval.\\" Coons pp. 89 His painting Coast of Carmel was selected for the California Art Club Exhibition of 1931 at the Los Angeles Museum, which is now called the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.Coons pp. 100 During the 1930s, Clunie received several commissions to paint large dioramas at the California Exposition & State Fair in Sacramento. Crowds would gather to watch him paint.Coons pp. 105 In 1935, Clunie spent two months painting in Taos, New Mexico. Local painter Walter Ufer praised Clunie's work there, urging him, \\"Stay in Taos, Robert. You are giving it a new look.\\" Ansel Adams called one of his Taos paintings, Vaya Con Dios - St. Francis of Assisi Mission - Moonlight a \\"masterpiece\\".Coons pp. 112 - 122 In February, 1937, Clunie won first prize in the Academy of Western Painters Exhibition for his painting Saginaw River. The painting won third prize at the California Exposition and State Fair in 1938.Coons pp. 130 - 141 He painted in the Grand Tetons each summer from 1938 to 1941, and the Los Angeles Times described his Teton paintings as \\"impressive\\" and said that \\"the artist has approached his subject with a bold, strong technique combining the finest in art with a reality and geographic correctness which has excited the highest admiration from the rangers in charge of the district as well as art critics\\". He became friends with mountaineers Paul Petzoldt and Jack Durrance in the Tetons.Coons pp. 140 - 162 When Germany invaded Poland in September, 1939, Clunie developed melancholia and was unable to paint for a year. Clunie was an enthusiastic chess player. He beat Reuben Fine at chess on September 15, 1940. Clunie was the only player who beat Fine, a grandmaster, during his two-month tour of the country. When the United States entered World War II, Clunie spent six months doing camouflage painting at Navy refuelling depots at Morro Bay and Cayucos, California. In 1942, Clunie went back to his favorite painting location in the Palisades peaks, and returned every summer until 1966, usually spending about two months in the wilderness. He would usually hire five mules to pack in his gear.  Postwar years in Bishop, California  Clunie and his wife purchased property below the Eastern Sierras in Bishop, California in 1945, and began building a home and studio. He announced that he was leaving Santa Paula, and the art community in that city organized an exhibit and reception in his honor, attended by over 600 people. Prominent artists including Edgar Alwin Payne and Leland Curtis would often visit Clunie at his High Sierra campsite, and in 1947, 119 members of the Sierra Club camped close by. Edna Spalding of the Sierra Club wrote \\"The highlight of tonight's campfire program was the talk by Bob Clunie, the artist, whom we have all adopted as one of our own. We have cherished his friendly presence around camp -- and now can understand both the man and his pictures better for having heard him tell what these mountains mean to him, and how he feels it is his duty and privilege to tell the world about them.\\" His new home in Bishop was completed in 1948, and he sold his Santa Paula home. Gradually, he stopped entering his paintings in exhibitions, and concentrated on selling his paintings out of his studio or at his wilderness campsite. In 1955, he served on the Inyo County Grand Jury, investigating taxation of water exported from the Owens Valley by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. He developed a friendship with Robert William Wood, another painter who lived in Bishop. In 1967, he and his wife took a painting trip to the coast of Maine. In 1980, the Arts Commission of the city of Bishop honored him with a retrospective exhibit of 84 paintings. A banner hung over U.S. Route 395 promoting the two-week exhibit. His wife Myrtle died in June, 1981. In 1982, he returned to Yosemite Valley to paint for the first time since 1929, traveling with his prot√©g√© and biographer, Richard Coons. In May, 1983, the Ventura County Historical Museum exhibited paintings by Clunie and Coons. Jane Nolan, critic for the Ventura County Star Free Press, wrote, \\"The soaring Sierra Nevada drew landscape artist Robert Clunie like a magnet. For more than 50 years, the Bishop artist has painted the pure colors of the mountains -- sky blues, pine greens and snowy whites.\\" Clunie suffered a stroke during this exhibit. His health declined, and he died in November, 1984 in Los Gatos, California, near his son Kent's home.Coons pp. 252 - 255  Legacy  Clunie's lost painting, The Cliff, which had been missing since 1929, came to light shortly after his death. The wife of art book publisher Walter Foster had received it as a gift from friends of hers in Napa, California. It is not known how the painting made its way there.Coons pp. 81 Clunie's home and studio in Bishop was purchased by painter Richard Coons, who renamed it the Coons Gallery. Since Coons' death in 2003, the gallery has been operated by his widow, Spotted Dog Press publisher Wynne Benti. Clunie was a longtime advocate for a dedicated art museum in Santa Paula. The Santa Paula Art Museum opened on February 14, 2010, featuring works by Clunie and many of his contemporaries.

Since moving to the United States in 1969, his work has been focused on the exploration of human creativity and the inner dynamics of the creative process. Early life and career Seeff graduated with honors in science and art at King Edward VII School in Johannesburg. At the age of 17, he was drafted as the youngest player in the South African national soccer league. Seeff qualified as a medical doctor in 1965. For three years he worked in emergency medicine at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, focusing on the management of traumatic shock. In 1968, he immigrated to the United States to pursue his creative passions and artistic abilities. New York Soon after Seeff arrived in New York City, his photographs of the people he encountered on the streets of Manhattan were discovered by the famed graphic designer Bob Cato. As the former Vice President of Creative Services at Columbia Records, Cato was renowned for his album cover design which had won two Grammy Awards. Cato became an important mentor to Seeff and gave him his first major photographic assignment producing images for The Band's Stage Fright album. Seeff's iconic image of the group was re-produced as a poster inserted under the album's shrink wrap, which when unfolded, became a hugely popular collectors' item. This brought him immediate recognition and launched his career as a \\"rock\\" photographer. His early work also includes images of Debbie Harry, Patti Smith, Robert Mapplethorpe, Andy Warhol as well as other New York City personalities. In 1971, Seeff spent a year as Professor of Photography at Bennington College in Vermont. Los Angeles At the end of 1971 and on the recommendation of Cato, Seeff relocated to Los Angeles to become creative director of United Artists Records. His innovative approach to collaborative art-direction resulted in multiple Grammy Award nominations for graphic design. Two years later, he opened an independent studio on the 'strip' on Sunset Boulevard. His photographic sessions soon became legendary and attracted audiences of 30‚Äì40 at each session, swelling to over 200 on some occasions. In his evolution as a photographer of public personalities, Seeff realized that to accomplish the vitality and authenticity he was looking for in his images required a paradigm shift in his interaction with artists and innovators. Creating the session as both a nurturing and challenging environment for a co-creative relationship with artists, it evolved as a laboratory for the exploration of the fundamental dynamics of creativity from the \\"inside\\" out. Responding to the emotional authenticity and depth of the creative communication between himself and artists, Seeff brought a film crew into a session for the first time in 1975, beginning with Ike and Tina Turner. For Seeff, the session became the art-form itself, transforming into a multi-disciplinary process of photography, filmmaking and creative communication. Shifting his focus from ends to means and creating an authentic experience in the moment revealed that optimal experience flowed elegantly into optimal performance. For Seeff it was a personal paradigm shift in his understanding of the creative process. Seeff has documented over 500 sessions with artists of many disciplines including musicians, actors, writers, directors, actors, scientists, entrepreneurs, and politicians. His creative interaction with renowned creators and innovators includes such luminaries as Ray Charles, Joni Mitchell, Guthrie Thomas, Kiss, Steve Jobs, Steve Martin, John Huston, Martin Scorsese, Billy Wilder, Bob Fosse, will.i.am, Tina Turner, Alicia Keys, Sir Francis Crick, Nobel Prize winners and hundreds of others. Television commercials In 1990, Seeff applied the spontaneous and co-creative approach he had developed during his photo sessions to working with actors in television commercials. During the 1990s, he became an acclaimed, award-winning director of hundreds of national commercials for major brands including Apple, Levi's, Glaxo, Nissan, Toyota, General Motors and Motorola. Recent work Seeff returned to photography and the documentation of his sessions in 1999 in order to produce a documentary exploration of the artist's journey for the opening of Paul Allen's Experience Music Project and sessions with the stars of Paramount Television and Caltech's many Nobel Science Laureates. It was the latter assignment that led to Seeff being invited to work with the NASA space explorers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and to the production of his documentary film Triumph of the Dream. The documentary reveals the human face of the Mars Exploration mission that landed two rovers on Mars in 2004. In the film, Seeff uses the Seven Stage Dynamic of the Creative Process he developed in his photo sessions as the underlying narrative structure. Seeff's recent sessions have included an exploration of the world of electronic music with participants of the 2013 Red Bull Music Academy and the production of a web series for Red Bull Media House. Exploration of creativity As a consequence of 35 years of research and development of creativity in action, Seeff has developed a body of content exploring the roots of creativity, innovation and optimal performance and has identified schematics describing the archetypes of the creative process that function across all creative disciplines. The fundamental tenet of his work is that all creation is sourced in the inner resources of consciousness and that everyone has access to the same innate resources. Seeff views himself as a conduit for the voices of the hundreds of creative and innovative individuals working at the higher reaches of human potential he has interacted with over many decades. He is now preparing this multi-media and multi-disciplinary content for global release via multiple interactive digital platforms. Personal life Seeff lives in Los Angeles with his wife Sue Kiel and works out of his studio in Burbank. He has two children. His daughter, Tai Power Seeff, who was his daughter with Taryn Power, is a photographer. Famous photographs 1.)

It remains in use with the Zimbabwe National Army.  General description  Built on a Nissan, Toyota or Isuzu 5-tonne truck chassis, the Crocodile consisted of an open-topped hull or 'capsule' faceted at the sides, which were designed to deflect small-arms' rounds, and a flat bottom or 'deck' reinforced by a v-shaped 'crush box' meant to deflect landmine blasts. Three inverted U-shaped high 'Roll bars' were fitted to protect the fighting compartment from being crushed in case the vehicle turned and roll over after a mine detonation. Protection The Crocodile was appreciated for its protection against landmines and ambush, since its hull was made of welded ballistic 10mm mild steel plate, whilst the front windscreen and side windows had 40mm bullet-proof laminated glass.Locke & Cooke, Fighting Vehicles and Weapons of Rhodesia 1965-80 (1995), p. 45. However, the heavy \\"Croc\\"'s hull added about 3 tonnes of armour to a commercial truck chassis nominally road rated at 7.5 tonnes, placing a strain especially on its clutch and brakes.Locke & Cooke, Fighting Vehicles and Weapons of Rhodesia 1965-80 (1995), p. 43.  Armament  Rhodesian \\"Crocs\\" were usually armed with a FN MAG-58 7.62mm Light Machine Gun (LMG), sometimes installed on a locally produced one-man MG armoured turret to protect the gunner. Vehicles assigned to convoy escorting duties ('E-type') had a Browning M1919A4 7.62mm medium machine gun mounted on an open-topped, cylinder-shaped turret (dubbed 'the dustbin') whilst those employed on 'externals' received a tall, square-shaped and fully enclosed MAG turret mounted on the roof over the commander's seat.Locke & Cooke, Fighting Vehicles and Weapons of Rhodesia 1965-80 (1995), p. 45. The Zimbabwean vehicles after 1980 sported pintle-mounted Soviet-made 12.7mm and 14.5mm Heavy Machine Guns (HMG) instead.  Variants  *Troop- Carrying Vehicle (TCV) ‚Äì is the standard IFV/APC fully protected version, armed with either a single LMG (Rhodesian SF 1978‚Äì79) or HMG (ZNA 1980‚Äìpresent) and capable of accommodating 16 infantrymen. *Convoy escorting version ‚Äì designated 'E-type', this is a basic IFV/APC version fitted with a turret, either the 'dustbin' with Browning MG or the 'box' variant with MAG-58 LMG. *Light TCV version ‚Äì standard IFV/APC version with scaled-down armour. *Jackal ‚Äì unarmed civilian version employed by the Rhodesian Posts & Telecommunications Corporation (PTC).  Combat history  The Crocodile APC was employed by the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI)Grant & Dennis, Rhodesian Light Infantryman 1961‚Äì80 (2015), pp. 24-25; 56-57. late in the war on their cross-border covert raids ('externals') against ZIPRA and ZANLA guerrilla bases in the neighboring Countries,Locke & Cooke, Fighting Vehicles and Weapons of Rhodesia 1965-80 (1995), p. 58. such as the September 1979 raid on the ZANLA's New Chimoio base in Mozambique (Operation \\"Miracle\\").Touchard, Guerre dans le bush! Les blind√©s de l'Arm√©e rhod√©sienne au combat (1964-1979), pp. 65; 73. After independence, the Crocodile APC entered service with the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) in early 1980. In November that year, ZNA's \\"Crocs\\" were thrown into action against ZIPRA troops at the 1st Battle of Entumbane and later at the February 1981 2nd Battle of Entumbane (near Bulawayo, Matabeleland), and later again after February 1982 by helping to put down the Super-ZAPU insurgency also in Matabeleland. During the Mozambican Civil War, they were employed by the ZNA forces in Mozambique guarding the Mutare-Beira oil pipeline in 1982‚Äì1993, and served with Zimbabwe troops in the ill-fated United Nations' peacekeeping mission in Somalia (UNOSOM I) from 1992 to 1994. During that assignment, a few \\"Crocs\\" were loaned to the U.S. Marines contingent for convoy escort and security duties in the Mogadishu area. The \\"Crocs\\" served with the ZNA contingent sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo during the Second Congo War from 1998 to 2002.Abbott & Ruggeri, Modern African Wars (4): The Congo 1960-2002 (2014), pp. 41-42.  Operators  * ‚Äì About 40 vehicles still in service with the ZNA.  Former operators  * ‚Äì 130 vehicles in service with the Rhodesian Security Forces in 1977‚Äì1980 passed on to successor state. * ‚Äì Unknown number in service with the U.S. Marines in Somalia 1992‚Äì1994.

It was destroyed in 1931. It was located at the site of what is now Shahumyan Square in Yerevan's Kentron District. History The Russian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Nikolai was located in the middle of the north-eastern side of the Cathedral Square (now Shaumyan Square) area. According to O. Khalpahkhyan, this Russian military cathedral at the central square of Yerevan, was built in the second half of the 19th century.

Its sign was Rs$. As the currency of the Portuguese empire, it was in use in Brazil from the earliest days of the colonial period, and remained in use until 1942, when it was replaced by the cruzeiro. The name real was resurrected in 1994 for the new currency unit (but with the new plural form reais). This currency is still in use. One modern real is equivalent to 2.75 √ó 1018 (2.75 quintillion) of the old r√©is. The name comes from the Portuguese word real (in the sense of \\"royal\\" or \\"regal\\") and was borrowed from a Portuguese currency previously used in Brazil. The dollar-like sign in the currency's symbol (and in the symbols of all other Brazilian currencies), called cifr√£o in Portuguese, was always written with two vertical strokes (\\\\mathrm{S}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\Vert) rather than one. History The Portuguese real was the currency used by the first Portuguese settlers to arrive in the Americas, but the first official money to circulate bearing the name \\"real\\" was actually printed in 1654 by the Dutch, during their occupation of part of the Brazilian Northeast. The real was retained when Brazil became independent in 1822. It was not sub-divided in smaller units, even though it was affected by significant inflation during its long lifespan. The practical currency unit shifted from the real to the mil r√©is (\\"one thousand r√©is\\") and then to the conto de r√©is (one million r√©is, literally \\"one count of r√©is\\") in the final years of the Rep√∫blica Velha era. Amounts under 1,000 r√©is were typically written prefixed by \\"Rs\\", as in \\"Rs 350\\". In amounts of 1,000 r√©is and over, the \\"Rs\\" remained as the prefix, but the cifr√£o \\"\\\\mathrm{S}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\Vert, a doubly stroked dollar sign, was inserted just after the thousands digit ‚Äî as in \\"Rs 1$712\\" for 1,712 r√©is. For amounts of one million reais and over, a colon \\":\\" was also inserted just after the millions digit, as in \\"Rs 1:020$800\\" for 1,020,800 r√©is. In the 18th century and early 19th centuries, the gold currency was based on the 22 carat gold piece which weighed ounce (14.34 grams). The standard for the silver currency varied during this period, with the 640 real coin fixed at on√ßa (17.92 grams) of .917 silver in 1806. In 1834, the pe√ßa was revalued at 10$000 r√©is and the silver 1$200 real coin was set at 415 grains (26.89 grams) of .917 silver. In 1846, a gold standard was established with the mil r√©is set at 822.076 mg gold, a 37.5% debasement from the previous standard. After the establishment of the Republic in 1889, the value of the currency fell, with a peg of 180 mg of gold for the one thousand r√©is set in 1926. This was abandoned in 1933 when the mil r√©is was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 12$500 r√©is = 1 dollar. A further devaluation occurred in 1939, when it was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 22$500 r√©is = 1 USD. In 1942, the real was replaced by the cruzeiro, at a rate of 1$000 r√©is = 1 cruzeiro.  Coins  In the 1750s, copper coins were in circulation in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 40 r√©is, silver coins for 75, 150, 300 and 600 r√©is, and gold coins for 1,000, 2,000, 4,000 and 6,400 r√©is. The silver coinage was reformed in 1778, with the introduction of 80, 160, 320 and 640 real coins. Between 1780 and 1782, gold 800, 1,600 and 3,200 r√©is were added. In 1809, older copper and silver coins were counterstamped with the Portuguese arms, doubling the value of 5, 10, 20 and 40 real pieces and increasing the value of 75, 150, 300 and 600 real coins to 80, 160, 320 and 640 r√©is. From 1810, Spanish 8 real coins (\\"Spanish dollars\\") were overstruck to produce 960 real coins. Copper 80 r√©is were introduced in 1811. Between 1823 and 1833, the copper coinage of Brazil varied across the country, with denominations of 10, 20, , 40, 75 and 80 r√©is being produced. Silver coins continued in denominations of 80, 160, 320, 640 and 960 r√©is, along with gold 4,000 and 6,400 r√©is. Between 1833 and 1835, the coinage was reformed. The copper coinage was standardized across the country, with the introduction of countermarked coins for 10, 20 and 40 r√©is. Silver coins were introduced in denominations of 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1,200 r√©is, along with gold 10,000 r√©is. A further reform between 1848 and 1854 reduced the silver and gold content of the coinage, with new silver coins for 200, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 r√©is, and gold 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 r√©is. Bronze 10 and 20 r√©is were introduced in 1868, followed by cupro-nickel 100 and 200 r√©is in 1871, bronze 40 r√©is in 1873 and cupro-nickel 50 r√©is in 1886. The 10 r√©is was discontinued in 1870. In 1901, cupro-nickel 400 r√©is were introduced, followed by cupro- nickel 20 r√©is in 1918. Aluminium-bronze 500 and 1000 r√©is were introduced in 1922, followed by cupro-nickel 200 r√©is, aluminium-bronze 2,000 r√©is and silver 5,000 r√©is in 1936. Banknotes The earliest Brazilian paper money was issued between 1770 and 1793 by the Administra√ß√£o Geral dos Diamantes (General Diamond Administration) to pay diamond prospectors. Various denominations were issued with the value written on at the time of issue. They circulated at face value and were convertible into coins. Notes were issued by various provinces between 1808 and 1857, in denominations of , 75, 150, 300, 450, 500, 600, 10,000, 25,000, 50,000 and 100,000 r√©is. The first Banco do Brazil was founded in 1808 and began issuing notes in 1810, in denominations of 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mil r√©is, with 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 20 mil r√©is added in 1813 and 1 and 2 mil r√©is in 1828. This bank closed in 1829. In 1833, the government issued copper exchange notes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mil r√©is. These were followed, in 1835, by Treasury notes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 mil r√©is. 500 mil r√©is notes were added in 1874, with 1,000 mil r√©is introduced in 1921. Treasury notes continued to be produced throughout the remaining period the real circulated and the final issues were overstamped to produce the first cruzeiro notes. Between 1850 and 1893, a number of private banks issued paper money in denominations between 10 and 500 mil r√©is. They included a later Banco do Brazil (1853‚Äì1890), the Banco do Maranh√£o (1857‚Äì1885) and the Banco da Rep√∫blica dos Estados Unidos do Brasil (1890‚Äì1892). Regional governments issued paper money between 1892 and 1897. Denominations included 100, 200 and 500 r√©is and 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200 and 500 mil r√©is, with issues from Alagoas, Amazonas, Maranh√£o, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe.

Also called advanced airfield for its advanced position, not advanced facilities, such an airfield typically does not carry full aircraft maintenance and service units, and lacks the comfort and security of a major air base. Advance airfields may be subject to enemy observation and attack. They may be expected to change hands after a battle. The advantages of using advance airfields are various. Air raids can penetrate deeper into enemy-held territory, surprising the enemy with unexpected range. Air units stationed nearer the front can respond more quickly to the needs of friendly land and naval units. Damaged aircraft can land at the advance airfield to save those aboard, and possibly the aircraft. Wounded personnel can be brought to the advance airfield to be evacuated for more complete hospital care at the rear. Shorter-range aircraft such as fighters can stage from an advance airfield to escort longer-range bombers in formation.

Jack contributed music to the cult films Super Troopers and Beerfest. In radio, Jack has been a commentator on PRI's The Takeaway beginning in 2008 and is a fill-in co-host for Sirius/XM's Freewheelin'. Jack studied acting at NYU and didn‚Äôt pick up a guitar until he was 18. His theatrical background made him extremely comfortable on the stage, to which his spirited live performances are a testament. An icon in New York City, Jack is often known as The Martini Cowboy, the title of his 2008 C.D. release on Radia Records. Jack formed his first band in 1993 in Boulder, CO. Steak was an experimental, Zappa-flavored 4-piece band that officially disbanded in ‚Äô99. Jack began working with a revolving group of musicians even to this day. Functioning more like a jazz bandleader, he has a main cast of characters but keeps two to three drummers on call for recordings and gigs. The band members come from all walks of life: jazz, rock, country and, well, other. Bassist, vocalist and wife Daria (Melomane, Pre-war Ponies, The (N.Y.) Moonlighters & God Is My Co-Pilot) keeps the rhythm going with the rotating drummers, Russ Meissner, Jason \\"J-Bird\\" Bowman and Bruce Martin (Tom Tom Club). Jack's most recent band, Van Hayride, a country version of Van Halen has a revolving door of members, which at times can feature Norah Jones, members of Yarn and Lee Ranaldo and the Dust. Van Hayride was recently hand picked by Puss n Boots, which features Sasha Dobson, Norah Jones and Catherine Popper, as the opener of Puss n Boots first US tour. Jack is currently recording a new album produced by Eric Ambel, and features Norah Jones on some of the tracks.

Earl St. John wanted a comeback vehicle and commissioned Eric Ambler to write her a film specifically as a vehicle for Lockwood. Although he had recently specialised in melodramas, Highly Dangerous was a comedy thriller in the vein of Lockwood's earlier hits, The Lady Vanishes and Night Train to Munich. It was directed by Roy Ward Baker, who had served with Ambler during the war. \\"One thing about Eric is that he presents you with a script that is beautifully finished in every detail\\", said Baker.McFarlane p 49 \\"I think Margaret Lockwood wanted to play a modern woman\\", recalled Baker. \\"It was actually Eric Ambler's first or second book, although the book had a different title and its main character was a man; Eric changed it to a woman to make it more interesting.\\"McFarlane p 50 The filmmakers wanted a Hollywood leading man to play opposite Lockwood. Wendell Corey was originally sought before the role was given to Dane Clark, who had recently left Warner Bros. Filming started in June 1950 and took place at Pinewood Studios. Reception Baker later said that \\"Highly Dangerous wasn't a very successful picture.... It was a good idea although I don't think I did it very well.\\"McFarlane p 49-50 Filmink said \\"it should have been Lady Vanishes-like but the film never gets its tone right. It starts off straight then goes a bit wacky and is just not fun ‚Äì it lacks comic relief, and Lockwood seems old and tired.\\" References *McFarlane, Brian, An Autobiography of British Cinema, 1997 External links Highly Dangerous at TCMDB *Highly Dangerous at Britmovie Film4 review *Review of film at Variety Category:1950 films Category:British films Category:British spy films Category:Cold War spy films Category:British black-and-white films Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:Films directed by Roy Ward Baker Category:1950s action films Category:Films scored by Richard Addinsell Category:Lippert Pictures films Category:1950s spy films ","title":"Highly Dangerous"},{"id":"26071577","text":"Vira Manikkatevan Turai is a small town in Sri Lanka.

It was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 219‚Äì224 in its catalogues, where it is advertised as a grande f√©erie extraordinaire en 20 tableaux.  Cast  The casts of M√©li√®s's films are in many cases unidentified. Most of the following listing is based on cast identifications made by the film scholars Georges Sadoul, Jacques Malth√™te, and Laurent Mannoni. * Barral as Cinderella. Barral had also acted in M√©li√®s's bedroom farce The Bridegroom's Dilemma earlier that year.Malth√™te & Mannoni, p. 94 *Bleuette Bernon as the Fairy Godmother. M√©li√®s discovered Bernon in the 1890s, when she was performing as a singer at the cabaret L'Enfer. Her appearance in Cinderella is contemporaneous with her performances at the Eldorado cabaret. She also appeared as Phoebe, the woman on the crescent moon, in M√©li√®s's famous A Trip to the Moon. *Carmelli as the Prince. Carmelli was an actor at M√©li√®s's theater of stage illusions, the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin in Paris. *Jehanne d'Alcy as the Prince's mother, the Queen. D'Alcy had achieved success in theatrical productions by 1896, but left the stage to devote herself to film, becoming one of the first performers to do so. She appeared in many of M√©li√®s's films and later became his second wife. *Dupeyron as a party guest. *Georges M√©li√®s as the genie of the midnight clock, and as a halberdier. All told, M√©li√®s took an acting role in at least 300 of his 520 films.Malth√™te & Mannoni, p. 88  Production  Gustave Dor√©'s illustrations were influential to M√©li√®s M√©li√®s modeled the film's visual style on the engravings of Gustave Dor√©, who had illustrated the story for an edition of Perrault's fairy tales. (Dor√© was stylistically influential across M√©li√®s's career, especially in this film and in his film adaptations of four other works Dor√© had illustrated: Red Riding Hood, Blue Beard, The Wandering Jew, and Baron Munchausen's Dream.) The direct inspiration for the film of Cinderella was probably a stage adaptation premiered in 1896 by the Th√©√¢tre de la Galerie-Vivienne and played by the Troupe Raymond at M√©li√®s's own theatre of illusions, the Th√©atre Robert-Houdin, at Christmastime of 1897.Frazer, p. 220 M√©li√®s may also have been inspired by the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet's lavish 1895 stage production of the story.Frazer, p. 7 Cinderella was M√©li√®s's first film with multiple scenes (tableaux), using six distinct sets and five changes of scene within the film. (His catalogue, by dividing the action into smaller beats, lists twenty tableaux within the film, a generous numbering probably devised for publicity reasons.) So many extras were used in Cinderella that M√©li√®s designated a Chief Extra to lead them. The film's special effects were created with multiple exposures, dissolves, and substitution splices.  Reception  Cinderella was M√©li√®s's first major cinematic success.Malth√™te & Mannoni, p. 106 It did well both in French fairground cinemas and at European and American music-halls, and inspired M√©li√®s to create other lavishly designed storytelling films with multiple scenes. His next film with multiple scenes, Joan of Arc (1900), was his first to surpass 200 meters of film in length, and was also a marked success. According to the film historian Lewis Jacobs, Cinderella's use of spectacle on screen also influenced the films of Cecil B. DeMille. M√©li√®s made another adaptation of the story, Cinderella or the Glass Slipper, in 1912 under the supervision of Path√© Fr√®res. This version was not a success, partially because of directorial conflict between M√©li√®s, Ferdinand Zecca, and Charles Path√©, and partially because M√©li√®s's theatrical style had fallen out of fashion by 1912.

Originally published by the Curtis Publishing Company, Holiday's circulation grew to more than one million subscribers at its height. The magazine employed writers such as Truman Capote, Joan Didion, Lawrence Durell, James Michener and E. B. White. The magazine was relaunched as a bi-annual magazine in 2014, located in Paris, but written in English. History Holiday was an American travel magazine that was picked up and then introduced by the Curtis Publishing Company in 1946. By the end of the first year the circulation topped 425,000. The magazine was headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the Curtis Center near Independence Hall. Ted Patrick was the editor beginning with the fifth issue and until his sudden death in 1964. The magazine was known as a cosmopolitan travel wishbook with photo essays in full-color oversize 11 X 13.5 package along with articles by famous authors. John Lewis Stage, a photographer for Holiday described they way that Patrick enlisted name authors, \\"The concept was basically to get famous authors who had maybe one or two weeks in between their books or projects to go and travel and write glorious pieces. So you‚Äôd have James Michener sent off to the South Pacific, for example. It was an intriguing way to put together a magazine. It was an oddball publication that used photographs to tell stories.‚Äù Paul Theroux writing about Paul Bowles said of the magazine, \\"The frivolous name masked a serious literary mission. The English fiction writers, V. S. Pritchett and Lawrence Durrell also traveled for this magazine, so did John Steinbeck after he won his Nobel Prize for literature, when he crisscrossed the United States with his dog....Bowles wrote a piece for Holiday about hashish, another of his enthusiasms, since he was a life-long stoner. The magazine came of age in the Jet Age--a time post-World War II when Americans were beginning to travel for leisure and joining the jet set was a glamorous aspiration. A Vanity Fair article in 2013 stated that \\"what Vogue did for fashion, Holiday did for destinations. Many remember the atmosphere of the editorial department as resembling Mad-Men. The son of executive editor Carl Biemiller described the atmosphere \\"there was one hell of a cocktail-party circuit...\\" E. B. White wrote his 7500-word essay on the city of New York, \\"Here is New York\\", for the magazine in 1949. White's stepson, Roger Angell, worked at the magazine in 1948.The essay was published as a gift book by Harper and it was also released as a Book-of-the-Month Club edition. Vanity Fair has since said of the essay, \\"It would become not only one of the most famous essays ever composed about the island of Manhattan but perhaps the finest. Over the years its plaintive language has been categorized as both poem and hymn.\\" After 9/11, Vanity Fair also published the essay in book form in 2002 as a tribute. By 1961 the magazine was making almost $10 million a year in revenue, and by the next year the magazine had grown to just under a million. After Ted Patrick's sudden death in 1964 there were internal issues between the current staff and Curtis Publishing Company over the direction of the magazine. Don A. Schanche of The Saturday Evening Post succeeded Patrick as editor. In response four of the editors, Harry Sions (editorial director), Frank Zachary (managing editor), Albert H. Farnsworth (executive editor), and Louis F. V. Mercier (pictures editor) resigned. Several of the magazine's writers, artists and photographers put out a large ad in the New York Times to \\"salute\\" the four as \\"good editors.\\" Curtis sold Holiday to the publisher of Travel, a competing magazine.

She was styled Lady Elizabeth Percy between 1667 and 1679, Countess of Ogle between 1679 and 1681, Lady Elizabeth Thynne between 1681 and 1682 and Duchess of Somerset between 1682 and 1722. Elizabeth was the only surviving child and sole heiress of Joceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland (1644‚Äì1670). Lady Elizabeth was one of the closest personal friends of Queen Anne, which led Jonathan Swift to direct at her one of his sharpest satires, The Windsor Prophecy, in which she was named \\"Carrots.\\" Marriages and children She married three times, having children by the third marriage only:  Henry Cavendish, Earl of Ogle  At the age of twelve she married, on 27 March 1679, the 20 year-old Henry Cavendish, Earl of Ogle (1659 ‚Äì 1 November 1680), the only son and heir of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle, who in accordance with the marriage settlement adopted the surname of Percy in lieu of his patronymic.Collins, Arthur, Peerage of England, Volume 4, London, 1756, p.186] However he died the following year and was buried in the parish church at the Percy seat of Petworth. The couple had no children; due to Elizabeth's age, the marriage probably had not been consummated.  Thomas Thynne  On 15 November 1681, at the age of fourteen, she married Thomas Thynne (died 1682) of Longleat, Wiltshire, known due to his great income as \\"Tom of Ten Thousand\\", a relative of Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth. He was murdered the following February by a gang on the order of Swedish Count Karl Johann von K√∂nigsmark, who had started to pursue Elizabeth following the rumour that her marriage was unhappy. For the rest of her life, Elizabeth's enemies spread the story that she had incited the murder. The actual murderers were hanged, but K√∂nigsmark was acquitted of being an accessory to the crime, despite widespread public feeling against him. There were no children from this marriage.

Marshalling as shown sculpted on overmantel of the Marble Hall, Petworth HousePer photograph in Nicolson, Nigel, Great Houses of Britain, London, 1978, p.166 At the age of fifteen, five months after the death of Thomas Thynne, Elizabeth married, on 30 May 1682, the 20 year-old Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, of Marlborough Castle in Wiltshire, and so became Duchess of Somerset. Soon after the marriage, he rebuilt in palatial style her father's principal seat Petworth House in Sussex. She was Mistress of the Robes to Queen Anne from 1710 to 1714. The marriage is said to have been unhappy: while she brought the Duke great wealth, it was said that she received neither affection nor gratitude in return. By the Duke she had the following children: * Charles Somerset, Earl of Hereford (baptized 22 March 1683 ‚Äì died before 26 Aug 1683), who died in infancy. *Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset (11 November 1684 ‚Äì 7 February 1749), eldest surviving son and heir. His only daughter and sole heiress, Lady Elizabeth Seymour, suo jure Baroness Percy, together with her husband Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet (died 1786) (who in 1749 adopted the surname Percy and in 1766 was created Duke of Northumberland), inherited half the great Percy estates, including Alnwick Castle and Syon House. *Percy Seymour, died unmarried. *Lady Elizabeth Seymour (1685‚Äì2 April 1734), wife of Henry O'Brien, 8th Earl of Thomond (1688‚Äì1741), childless. His chosen heir was her younger nephew, Percy Wyndham-O'Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond (c. 1713 ‚Äì 1774), of Shortgrove, Essex, who adopted the surname O'Brien and was elevated to the peerage. *Lady Catherine Seymour (1693 ‚Äì 9 April 1731), wife of Sir William Wyndham, 3rd Baronet (c. 1688 ‚Äì 1740) of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset. Her eldest son was Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont (1710‚Äì1763), who inherited half of the great Percy estates including Petworth House and Egremont Castle. *Lady Anne Seymour (1709 ‚Äì 27 November 1722), died young. *Lady Frances Seymour, died unmarried.  Political influence  Elizabeth Seymour circa 1710 The Duke and Duchess were among the Queen's oldest friends, with whom she had come to live at Syon House in 1692 after a heated quarrel with William III and Mary.Gregg, E.G. (1980, London) (republished 2014, Yale) Queen Anne Elizabeth served as Groom of the Stole and First Lady of the Bedchamber. Like Marlborough before him, Somerset used his wife's position as royal confidante to advance his career. Both of them became the target of violent verbal attacks, especially from Jonathan Swift who hoped to influence the Queen through Mrs Abigail Masham, the obvious rival for the position of confidante. Apparently against Masham's wishes he published a scathing diatribe, The Windsor Prophecy, against the Duchess in which her character is derided as \\"Carrots\\" (a common nickname derived from the Duchess' red hair). Swift explicitly accused the Duchess of having conspired to murder her second husband, and wildly suggested that she might poison the Queen \\"I have been told, they assassin when young and poison when old\\". The Queen was outraged; always a bad enemy to make, from then on she refused to consider Swift for preferment to a bishopric: even his appointment as Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, was made against her strongly expressed wishes (she did not have power to veto it). Ignoring the gossip, she insisted on retaining the Duchess in her household. The Duke's pride and arrogance eventually wore out the Queen's patience and he was dismissed from his court offices early in 1712. The Queen's doctor, Sir David Hamilton, advised her to keep the Duchess in her service \\"for her own quiet\\", and the Queen agreed. The Duchess remained with the Queen to the end of Anne's life, by which time Lord Dartmouth described her as \\"much the greatest favourite\\". During the Queen's painful last days, Elizabeth's calm and soothing manner is said to have brought some comfort, whereas Masham was in a state of hysterics.  Reputation  A painting of Elizabeth Seymour by Peter Lely Elizabeth's influence on the Queen, together with her colourful past, made her many enemies. Like her third husband she seems to have been proud, although Lord Dartmouth called her \\"the best bred as well as the best born person in England\\".Gregg She showed great skill in dealing with the Queen, her secret, it was said, being never to press the Queen to do anything for her, in contrast to Abigail Masham who constantly asked for favours. She was known as a shrewd observer of Court life and a notorious gossip; even the Queen, who was fond of her, called her \\"one of the most observing, prying ladies in England\\". Estates and residences Lady Elizabeth Percy brought immense estates to her husbands and in addition her residences: Alnwick Castle, Petworth House, Syon House and Northumberland House in London.

He was the earliest of the three Port Adelaide players drafted in the first round in the 2009 AFL Draft (he went at pick #8). Butcher's younger brother Danny was drafted to Port Adelaide as part of the Rookie Draft in 2011 at pick 21. Originally from Maffra, Victoria, Butcher is a versatile key position prospect with great agility and pace for his size. Butcher is an excellent contested mark and has been noted for his \\"clean hands\\".John Butcher expected to go top-two in national draft He was extremely impressive at the AFL Draft Camp with his speed (2.99 sec over 20 m) and repeat sprints (24.88 sec) being in the top 28 per cent of all players. He kicked 40 goals for the year for Gippsland Power and Vic Country in 16 games. He was a Vic Country Under 18 representative in both 2008 and 2009, including kicking three goals against Vic Metro in 2009. Butcher is also an AIS-AFL Academy graduate. He was widely tipped to be the first key-position player to be selected in the 2009 draft.Melbourne faces decision on key forward John Butcher Due to injuries and the time needed to develop key position players, Butcher didn't debut until Round 21 of 2011, when Port Adelaide were defeated by by a club-record 165 points. To date it remains the worst defeat suffered by any player in his debut match in VFL/AFL history. In his second match against he kicked 6 straight goals from six disposals. However, following Butcher's promising debut season which saw him nicknamed by supporters as 'The Future', Butcher has since struggled to establish himself as an AFL player. Butcher played the first three games of the 2014 season for an underwhelming return of two goals before being returned to the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) where he played out the remainder of the season. He finished the season as the leading goalkicker for the Magpies with 32 goals. Butcher's 2015 season start was also a struggle as he'd managed only indifferent form in the SANFL, had played just the one AFL match in Round 1 and looked odds on to be delisited at the end of the season. However, with Jay Schulz being a late exclusion in Round 20, Butcher came in against Greater Western Sydney and played the final four matches of the AFL season. Butcher's marking in the final two matches of the season was sublime gathering 6 contested marks and 7 marks inside 50 against Gold Coast and Fremantle. His end of season form was rewarded with a one-year contract offer for 2016. He was delisted at the conclusion of the 2016 season and subsequently signed to play football for Central Districts Football Club in the SANFL in 2017.

Opened on 29 November 2014, it is the single specialist paediatric hospital for Queensland, caring for the sickest and most critically injured children from across the state. As well as emergency, critical care and general paediatric services, the hospital has paediatric speciality services. The hospital combined the former Royal Children's Hospital at Herston and the Mater Children's Hospital at South Brisbane together into one new facility at an estimated construction cost of A$1.2 billion. The 12-level facility represents the largest capital investment in children's health services in Queensland's history. The Queensland Children's Hospital is categorised as a level six service, under the Clinical Services Capability Framework for Public and Licensed Private Health Facilities v3.2, 2014. This means it is responsible for providing general paediatric health services to children and young people in the greater Brisbane metropolitan area, as well as tertiary-level care for the state‚Äôs sickest and most seriously injured children. The hospital employs more than 2,500 people from a range of disciplines; and in its first year admitted almost 38,000 inpatients, saw 63,634 emergency presentations, performed 14,113 operations and provide 188,765 outpatient appointments.  Education and research  The Queensland Children's Hospital is world-renowned as a centre for teaching and research, providing undergraduate-, postgraduate- and practitioner-level training in paediatrics. It also plays a significant role in medical research, undertaking research programs with affiliated universities including The University of Queensland and Queensland University of Technology. It is co-located with the $134 million Centre for Children's Health Research, officially opened on 27 November 2015. The nine-level centre houses wet and dry laboratories, pathology services, a gait laboratory, a nutrition laboratory, and the Queensland Children‚Äôs Tumour Bank (funded by the Children's Hospital Foundation) which provides a tissue repository for national and international cancer research.  Hospital name  Workers removing the L from the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital building, 13 December 2018, to facilitate the renaming as Queensland Children's Hospital During the early stages of the project, the hospital was known as the Queensland Children's Hospital. On 15 December 2013, the then Queensland Premier Campbell Newman announced that the hospital would be named after the renowned Queensland clinician, Lady Phyllis Cilento. On 21 September 2018, health minister Steven Miles announced that the hospital would revert to its original name of Queensland Children's Hospital, after staff petitioned the Queensland government to change the name to a more \\"conventional\\" one, which the hospital's foundation said would secure more money from overseas donors. Miles claimed that an online poll showed strong support for the name change, but it was later revealed that many votes for the name change came from a small number of government IP addresses, suggesting there might have been an attempt by the government to rig the vote. Miles was referred to the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) in relation to the poll. On 13 December 2018 workers began removing the words Lady Cilento from the sign on the building.  Designed for health and healing  The award-winning design of the hospital maximises access to outside views and natural light. The Queensland Children's Hospital was designed by architects Conrad Gargett Lyons. Based on the concept of a ‚Äòliving tree‚Äô, the building features a network of trunks and branches running throughout, leading to several outdoor gardens, terraces that fill the hospital with as much natural light as possible. The building design has received a number of awards including the 2015 Queensland State Architecture Awards the F.D.G Stanley Award for Public Architecture and the Karl Langer Award for Urban Design from the Australian Institute of Architects. At the 2015 Design and Health International Academy Awards, the Hospital design was awarded as the overall winner for Salutogenic Design Project for Healthcare Environment. In addition it was awarded Highly Commended for International Health Project over 40,000m2. Interior Design Project, Use of Art in Public and Private Spaces.  Schooling  The hospital provides educational programs to students from prep to year 12 for inpatients, outpatients and family members of hospitalised patients in a number of settings and locations across the hospital community. The intention is that (where medically possible) children are able to continue their schooling while being treated at the hospital.

It is owned, operated, and opened to the public during the summer months by Mackinac Island State Park as part of Historic Downtown Mackinac Island. History and today The McGulpin House is built in a working-class French Canadian style. Its origins are unknown; it has not always stood on its current location. There are two theories about the origins of the building: the house could have been created as a home for the priest of St. Anne's Church or to be a home for people on the island. An analysis of the home's structural timbers indicates that they were hand-sawn with a pit saw, which indicates that the timbers were cut prior to the construction of the Mill Creek sawmill in about 1790. The house's timbers and design style indicate, but do not prove, that the structure was constructed prior to the settlement of Mackinac Island in 1780-1781. It is known that several private frontier houses were built in the vicinity of Fort Michilimackinac in the period between 1763 and 1780, which were prosperous years for the fur trade at the Straits of Mackinac. In 1780 Lieutenant Governor Patrick Sinclair, in a move related to the American Revolutionary War, ordered the fur traders and private citizens of the Fort Michilimackinac settlement to move to a fortified village on the southern end of Mackinac Island. The Strait of Mackinac froze solid with ice that winter, and there is documentary evidence that some wooden houses were partly dismantled and carried across the ice to their new island settlement. It is believed that the McGulpin House may have been one of these homes. After the War of 1812 the United States consolidated its political and economic control over Mackinac Island, the fur trade boomed, a title deed registry was opened, and written real estate records began. In 1819, what is now the McGulpin House was purchased by William and Madeline McGulpin, a craftsman baker and his wife. The McGulpins operated a shoreline farm on the Lower Peninsula mainland, near what is now Mackinaw City. The site of their farm was later named McGulpin Point in honor of these pioneer settlers. With local grain in hand, the McGulpins specialized in baking bread and hardtack for the American Fur Company's establishment on Mackinac Island. The fur company post on Market Street was by far the largest employer at the Straits of Mackinac, and resupplied dozens of fur traders who fanned out over the Upper Great Lakes by birchbark canoe to trap and trade for furs. The McGulpin House was moved to its current location in 1981. It has been opened to the public as a barebones restoration that concentrates on the actual structure of the home at it would have appeared around 1820, shortly after the McGulpins moved in. The McGulpins were a working-class family who would not have possessed a home fitted with many of the furnishings used by more prosperous families in the early American upper class. The McGulpin House can be compared with the nearby Biddle House, an upper-class home.

The Kittatinny Ridge and Valley Region: Northwest New Jersey Skylands. Retrieved June 30, 2015.George H. Cook, Geological Survey of New Jersey: Annual Report of the State Geologist for the Year 1880 (Trenton, NJ: John L. Murphy, 1881), 53-55. The valley is roughly long, with an average breadth of through the center of Sussex and Warren Counties.George H. Cook, Geology of New Jersey, (Newark: Daily Advertiser, 1868), 22. Geology and geography The Kittatinny Valley is in northern New Jersey. The western side of the valley goes from the New York state line, east of High Point, and runs southwest along the base of the eastern slope of Kittatinny Mountains to the terminal moraine created by the Wisconsin Glacier just north of Columbia on the New Jersey border with Pennsylvania. This is slightly south of the Delaware Water Gap. The eastern side of the valley trends northeast along Highlands of the Jenny Jump Mountains, then along the base of Allamuchy Mountains to Andover where it follows the western edge of the Pimple Hills to the Hamburg Mountains. The eastern edge of the valley follows the western base of Hamburg Mountain to the New York State line. The valley is about twenty-one miles long and ten miles wide. North of the New York state line is the Hudson Valley. South of the terminal moraine of the Wisconsin Glacier is the Lehigh Valley. The Hudson, the Lehigh, and the Kittatinny Valleys are all locally named sections of the Great Appalachian Valley. Sediment was deposited at the bottom of deep seas. The Kittatinny Valley was created during the late Ordovician period and the Cambrian period. This is when the volcanic island chain collided with proto North America, around four hundred fifty million BC. This is known as the Taconic Orogeny. The rock from the islands went over top of the North American plate. The sediment under the seas was compressed and formed shale and was uplifted. Thus the Kittatinny Valley was born. Then a small continent collided with proto North America around four hundred million BC. This created folding and faulting which created the Kittatinny Mountain and the southern Appalachians. The valley is situated between the Silurian Shawangunk quartz conglomerate and the lower Cambrian Hardyston quartzite. The Silurian Shawangunk conglomerate lies on top of the Martinsburg formation. This is due to the quartz pebbles being transported on top of the Martinsburg shale, and then due to geologic pressure, folded and faulted. Thus the Kitatinny Mountain was born. About half of the valley is of the Martinsburg formation which is shale and slate. Some of the valley is of the Kittatinny and Jacksonburg limestones. The Kittatinny formation formed during the Cambrian period. Most of the formations are in belts traversing a northeast to southwest axis. A volcanic brecca is at Rutan Hill which is along County Route 519 in Wantage Township, about northwest of Sussex Borough. During the Wisconsin Glacier which lasted from 21,000 BC to 13,000 BC, the valley was covered in three hundred meters of ice. The glacier melted and this created end moraines, eskers, lakes, and other post glacier formations. Lakes were also created, such as Culver's Lake, Lake Aeroflex, Cranberry Lake, and Lake Owassa. Lake Aeroflex is the deepest lake at deep. The valley is drained by three small shallow rivers. The first is the Paulinskill River which flows from Newton north to Augusta, then southeast to empty into the Delaware River near Columbia. The second is the Wallkill River which starts at Lake Mohawk in Sparta. The river flows northwest. Papakating Creek and the West Branch of Papakating Creek flow into the Wallkill north of the town of Sussex. The Wallkill flows north over the New York State line and drains into the Hudson River. The third small river is the Pequest River which begins in Andover Township and flows south to Great Meadows and then flows east to Belvidere and drains into the Delaware River. All three of these rivers are premier trout fishing streams, as they are stocked every year. History Paleo Indians and Native Americans After the Wisconsin Glacier melted around 13,000 BC, Paleo Indians found their way into the Kittatinny Valley around 10,500 BC. They hunted game, fished and gathered plants. The valley is fairly flat with fresh water streams which allowed for easy hunting and gathering various plants and nuts. Native Americans came later and camped along the shallow and narrow streams. These streams allowed for easy fishing, waterfowl hunting, as well as hunting small and large game in the forests. European settlement Europeans settled in the Kittatinny Valley in the early 1740s. The virgin forests were cut to allow for agriculture and the selling of timber. Eventually nearly all the forest was cleared by the early 1900s. Settlers built rock walls along the borders of the properties. These rock walls can be seen everywhere in the valley. Very few of these original houses exist today because the houses were made of wood and caught fire or rotted. Some were made of stone from the nearby area. Agriculture The Europeans saw that the valley was flat in places, and cut down the forests to start agricultural practices. Rocks were cleared from the land and places on rock walls which served as boundary markers. Low-lying fields are left to grow grass for cows and horses. Other fields are used to grow corn for horses or cows. On a few fields pumpkins or tomatoes are grown. There are apple and peach orchards. There are also dairy farms that have twenty to seventy-five cows.
