A horror reimagining of Hanna-Barbera's 1968 children's television series The Banana Splits, the film follows a family attending a live taping of the aforementioned show and trying to survive when the titular characters go haywire upon learning of their show's cancellation, starting a killing spree around the studio. The film stars Dani Kind, Steve Lund, Celina Martin, Finlay Wotjak-Hissong, Sara Canning, Romeo Carere, and Maria Nash, with Eric Bauza as the voice of the Banana Splits. The development of a Banana Splits film adaptation was announced in February 2019, following an original idea from Josh Van Houdt, Syfy's vice president of development about turning the project into a horror film. Esterhazy signed on as director from a script by Elinoff and Thomas, saying in an interview they drew inspiration from the 1986 horror film, Chopping Mall, and the 1988 slasher film, Child's Play. The Banana Splits Movie premiered at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 18, 2019, and was released on August 27, 2019 by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and was aired on the Syfy channel on October 12, 2019 for the Halloween season.  Plot  Harley Williams is a huge fan of The Banana Splits, a successful children's television series featuring four animatronic characters ‚Äî Fleegle, Bingo, Drooper and Snorky ‚Äî along with their human co-star Stevie. On his birthday, Harley's mother Beth and his stepfather Mitch take him to a live taping at Taft Studios with his older half-brother Austin and his classmate Zoe. Upon arrival, the family meet several audience and staff members like the show's hostess Paige and her assistant Doug, fan couple Thadd and Poppy, aspiring young performer Parker with her father Jonathan, and security guard Sal. As the taping is getting ready, the studio's new vice president of programming Andy informs the show's producer Rebecca that he is cancelling the show after the recording as it does not go with his network's vision. After Drooper overhears this, the Banana Splits' new software updates malfunction with Bingo kidnapping Andy and Drooper killing Stevie by thrusting a prop lollipop down his throat. Outside the studio, Beth learns Mitch is cheating on her with a woman named Kara. As she returns to the studio, Mitch finds Sal's decapitated corpse and is then chased and run over by Snorky. Meanwhile, Poppy accepts Thadd's marriage proposal while blogging the backstage before Fleegle arrives and murders Thadd by gorily sawing him in half. Fleegle leaves Poppy when he hears Harley and Zoe looking for Snorky, taking them to the workshop. He traps them with Parker, who Bingo kidnapped while Jonathan's face was burned by Drooper as they were looking for Andy for an audition. The remaining survivors learn about the Banana Splits' carnage after finding a seriously-injured Jonathan. While Paige finds all phones disconnected and the confiscated cells destroyed, Beth manages to defeat Bingo before she and Austin find Poppy and convince her to join them. At the same time, Rebecca and Jonathan are forced to participate in the show's obstacle course, with Jonathan stabbed to death by Fleegle with a key while Rebecca wins before Drooper smashes her face with a hammer. Harley, Zoe, and Parker meet the Banana Splits' creator Karl who considers his creations' actions justified by the show's cancellation and conflicted over freeing the children. Drooper brings Bingo for repair causing Karl to get distracted enough for the kids to escape and lock him in the cell. While looking for a way out, Harley, Zoe, and Parker come across Snorky and convince him to help them. Beth, Austin, Paige, and Poppy arrive at the workshop to ask Karl how to stop the Banana Splits. He does not provide any information, but the group hear music coming from a hatch in the floor. The others go down while Poppy notices the mask of an unused fifth Banana Split named \\"Hooty.\\" Losing her sanity, she puts on parts of the costume and kills Karl as revenge for Thadd's death. Finding the underground passage littered with the corpses of Doug, the studio's staff, and the adult audience members, the group discover Fleegle and Drooper holding children hostage while performing gruesome variants of their acts, like burning Stevie's corpse and brutally murdering Andy by ripping his limbs off. Snorky arrives and chains Harley, Zoe, and Parker with the other kids, but secretly gives Harley the keys to free them. Beth and Austin manage to destroy Fleegle and Drooper while Parker guides all the kids to the exit. Beth, Austin, and Harley meet up with Paige and Zoe before being cornered by Bingo. Suddenly, Snorky attacks Bingo and crushes his head, destroying him before deactivating himself from critical damage sustained. As the police and paramedics arrive to attend survivors, Parker asks her mother if she can quit acting class, Austin and Paige start a romantic relationship, and Beth demands a divorce from a heavily-injured Mitch. Left behind by paramedics, Mitch gets run over again, this time being killed by Poppy with the Banana Splits' remains in the back. As she drives, Fleegle is seen reactivating and laughing maniacally. During the credits, clips of the Banana Splits performing are shown followed by a rat passing by two severed fingers, presumably belonging to Karl‚Äôs.

The Banana Splits is a fun-filled, cacophony of zany deaths and characters, that plays out as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for grown-ups\\". William Bibbiani of Bloody Disgusting gave a positive review saying that the film \\"offers a satisfying sequence of slasher slays\\" but that it \\"relies so much on cognitive disconnect that never feels like more than an ironic kill count\\". Reviewer Jim Johnson, of Comic Book Resources, wrote that \\"it's a bold move that works, because, here in 2019, there's really nothing better to do with the Banana Splits. And it's not like anyone else had a better idea\\". Russ Burlingame of ComicBook.com praised the performances and script, saying \\"The Banana Splits Movie will be controversial ‚Äî especially among those who still have a fondness for the original series ‚Äî but it mostly sticks the landing, buoyed by a great cast, script and crew\\".

Between 1892 and 1897 he led the United States Marine Band. Biography  Francesco Luigi Fanciulli was born in Porto Santo Stefano.Mauro Bucarelli, \\"Fanciulli, Francesco Luigi,\\" Treccani (taken from Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, volume 44 (1994)), accessed 6 July 2019. He learned cornet at a young age and played in a local band. Displaying talent, he was sent to study at the Florence Conservatory, where he obtained his diploma. At age twenty he became the first cornettist at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence, and in 1875 he obtained a position in the orchestra of the Politeama Fiorentino. He was also engaged as a conductor at the Teatro Goldoni, at the Politeama, and at the Teatro Nazionale. Through touring Italy, he became known as a horn virtuoso, an opera director and composer.Frank J. Cipolla, \\"Francesco Fanciulli,\\" Marines: The Official Website of the United States Marine Corps (accessed 6 June 2019). In 1876 he emigrated to the United States to teach privately for a wealthy New York family. Arriving in New York on September 24, 1876, he also began working as an organist at St. Peter's Church in Brooklyn and as a teacher of piano and singing. He composed works for Patrick Gilmore's band. Among his compositions was a piece transcribed from his first opera The Voyage of Columbus that Gilmore described as \\"the most beautiful piece of descriptive music ever written.\\" Gilmore's performances of Fanciulli's works led to their popularization. In 1885‚Äîthe year he became a naturalized American‚ÄîFanciulli became principal conductor of the Mozart Musical Union, and in the early 1900s he became director of the Lillian Durell Opera Company of Boston.John R. Bourgeois, \\"The President's Own: A History of the United States Marine Band,\\" page 4 (website, accessed 7 July 2019) In 1892, Fanciulli's reputation increased when he succeeded John Philip Sousa as head of the United States Marine Band. He was the fourth Italian-born director of the band, having been preceded by Venerando Pulizzi (1816‚Äì17; 1818‚Äì27), Joseph Lucchesi (1844‚Äì46) and Francis M. Scala (1855‚Äì71). Fanciulli led his first concert on January 20, 1893, and presided over the inauguration of Grover Cleveland on March 4, 1893. Under his leadership, the Band won prestigious prizes such as the competition held in 1893 on the occasion of an international gathering of the most important American and European military bands in Hampton Roads. Fanciulli led the Band at the unveiling of Grant's Tomb on April 25, 1897. Despite the popularity of his compositions and the Marine Band's well-attended concerts, Fanciulli always felt burdened by the shadow of Sousa, his predecessor. Nevertheless, Fanciulli always programmed Sousa's works alongside of his own. During a parade in Washington D.C. on June 1, 1897, Fanciulli, who normally alternated compositions of Sousa with his own, opposed the request of a superior to encore a Sousa march which would have altered the expected order of the pieces. The discussion degenerated into a dispute. Accused of insubordination, Fanciulli was placed under house arrest. President Cleveland intervened so that Fanciulli could be released to accompany him with the Band the next day during an important speech in Philadelphia. However, when Fanciulli returned to Washington, a commission of inquiry from the Navy found him guilty of \\"failure to obey a lawful order, use of disrespectful language toward an officer, and conduct being prejudice to the conduct of good order and discipline.\\" Only the intervention of Theodore Roosevelt, at that time the United States Secretary of the Navy, mitigated the effects of the sentence. Fanciulli resumed his post, but on October 27, 1897, the Marine Headquarters announced that his assignment would not be renewed. Fanciulli returned to New York assuming leadership of the Band of the 71st Regiment of the National Guard. In 1901 Fanciulli and his Band participated in the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. In 1904, he left the National Guard and created a band of civil professionals, known as Fanciulli's Concert Band, and embarked on a tour of the United States. The national tour ended the following year as his management costs proved too expensive.\\"Fanciulli's biography,\\" Fanciulli, Their Hero (website for book, accessed 7 July 2019). For five seasons the Fanciulli's Concert Band continued its activity, holding concerts of great appeal in Central Park. For the remaining years of his life Fanciulli continued to compose and conduct. He died in 1915 at the German Hospital and Dispensary in New York after a serious illness. He is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York. His papers and manuscripts are kept at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Compositions Fanciiulli remains famous above all for his band songs, including the celebrated Trip to Mars , A Trip to Manhattan Beach , and The National Patriot. He was also a composer of operas and operettas. His first opera, The Voyage of Columbus, was completed in 1876 during his trip to America with the intention of presenting it at the Metropolitan Grand Opera Competition, a competition in which he discovered that foreign musicians were not allowed. After the failure of the opera Malinche, Fanciulli had better luck with Priscilla: The Maid of Portsmouth, based on a story by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow that was performed on several occasions. Fanciulli also wrote two comic operas, The Maid of Paradise and The Interpreter. = Marches and other works for band = * A Day With Teddy's Terrors * A Trip to Manhattan Beach * A Trip to Mars * Civic Fame March * Fantasie Allegoric of New York Under Various Governments * From Italy to America * Gilmore's Band Tour in Europe * Grand March Inaugural * March of Progress * Marine Band March * Old Glory March * Our National Patrol * Romaine Waltzes * Salve Regina * Savoria, grand march * Starving Innisfail * The Electric Century * The Evening Star March * The Examiner's March * The Florida Special March * The Man from Maine * The March to Creedmoor * The Old Time Singing School * The Stricken City * Troop A (The President's Guard) March * U.S.S.

Team captain Bruno Michaud filmed the events with his super-8 camara. The voyage around the world included 19 flights and numerous bus and train journeys. Club chairman, Lucien Schmidlin, led the group, but as they arrived in the hotel in Bangkok, he realised that 250,000 Swiss Francs were missing. The suitcase that he had filled with the various currencies was not with them. He had left it at home, but fortunately Swiss Air were able to deliver this to him within just a few days. During the tour a total of ten friendly/test games were played, these are listed in their 1963‚Äì64 season. Five wins, three draws, two defeats, but also three major injuries resulted from these test matches. A broken leg for Peter F√ºri, an eye injury for Walter Baumann and a knee injury for Bruno Michaud soon reduced the number of players to just 13. Blumer was a member of this tour. He played in all ten games and scored six goals. = Chiasso = In the second half of the 1964‚Äì65 Nationalliga A season Blumer moved to Chiasso, playing 14 games and scoring 3 goals.

The book won the Governor General's Award for fiction in 1936. Synopsis An expatriate Englishman has a weekend of self-discovery in Manitoba: he falls in love, and realizes that he must become less introspective. The protagonist, Geoff Tavistock, visits a small town in rural Manitoba in 1907. Tavistock believes he is on a divinely inspired mission - to reconcile man with God once and for all. Reception Sales of the initial publication in 1936 were slow and Brooker acknowledged that by the time his book was awarded the Governor General's Award, only eight copies had been sold. Think of the Earth has been portrayed as an example of ressentiment, a retelling of Crime and Punishment set as a historical novel of the Canadian Prairies in which a Nietzschean superman dreams of bringing his transvalued sense of justice to a primitive rural society. Literary critic John Moss characterized the book as being about a visionary experience but the book was not a visionary experience in itself. Moss called the prose awkward and the mood sombre. The protagonist Tavistock is portrayed as an eccentric without any trace of irony, an improbable messiah. Brooker's primary role as an abstract artist did not translate well to the medium of writing.

He is known as the captain who lead many Conquistadors including famous Conquistador and memoir-writer Bernal D√≠az del Castillo into several military campaigns to conquer or reconquer sections in southeastern Mexico. Marin would become a close friend and confidant of Cort√©s serving him from 1519 until 1531, the year after Cortes returned from Spain.  Biography  Cities in SE Mexico circa 1500s Luis Marin was born about 1490 in Sanl√∫car de Barrameda, C√°diz in the Andalucian region of Spain. His mother, Maria Bernal Guillen, was also born in Sanl√∫car de Barrameda while his father, Francisco Marin (known in Italy as Francesco Mar√≠ni), was from a noble, banking family from the Genova, Italy region. Marin married Maria de Mendoza, who herself was related to the second wife of Hernan Cortes. Marin had eleven children. Marin, according to the Bernal Diaz del Castillo's memoir, was a kind-heart gentleman even during military excursions where captured enemies would often be taken as slaves. Marin generally refused and returned custody of prisoners (including women and children) to the locals in attempt to peacefully resolve conflicts.  Spanish Conquests in Mexico  Marin arrived in the coastal city of Veracruz in late July 1519 at the age of 20 from Cuba with Francisco de Saucedo (known as El Pulido) after Hernan Cortes had arrived and began his campaigns against the Natives and had captured Veracruz earlier that month. After the death of Francisco de Saucedo during the retreat of the Battle of Tenochtitlan in 1520, Mar√≠n would engage in several campaigns ordered directly from Cortes himself including the fall of Tenochtitlan, the Hibueras campaign in Guatemala and Honduras as well as the conquests of Chiapas in mid 1523 and Tabasco in early 1524. As noted in Bernal Diaz del Castillo's memoir, on direct orders from Cortes, Marin would often travel the mountainous regions of Chiapas and Tabasco to quell Native American rebellions, many times engaging the enemy himself, if necessary, and being severely wounded on a few occasions. In Diaz del Castillo's memoir, Marin and his forces would travel to Guacasualco, Citla, Tabasco, Cimatlan and Chontalpa stretching deep into the deep forested southern regions and marshland northern regions of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and as far east as Quetzaltenango in northwest Guatemala and Tegucigalpa in Honduras. The control of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec later became a strategic possession as it granted the Spanish Crown the ability to traverse the shortest route across land to the Pacific Ocean.  Las Hibueras (Honduran Atlantic Coast)  On October 12, 1524, Luis Marin accompanied Hernan Cortes to the Hibueras (the Atlantic coastal district of current Honduras) . Hernan Cortes was en route to the Hibueras to defeat Captain Crist√≥bal de Olid who had rebelled against his authority and claimed Honduras for himself, naming himself Governor of Honduras (with the influence of the Governor of Cuba, Diego Vel√°zquez). Cortes asked many of the original Conquistadors to follow him in this trek and also brought La Malinche and Cuauhtemoc along this trek fearing they would start a rebellion in his absence. Aberrant about this betrayal from Olid, Cortes executed Cuauhtemoc in Yaxzam (disputed) on February 28, 1525. After an over year-long conflict, Cortes defeated Olid. He then ordered Marin to return to Mexico. Marin returned to Guacasualco in late 1526 with D. Pedro de Alvarado.  Failing to conquer Chiapas and asking Cortes for reinforcements  He returned to Guacasualco, Veracruz, Mexico and gathered forces to begin an attack in Chiapas. This expedition included now Captain Bernal Diaz de Castillo, Francisco Martin (Calvery Master), Francisco Ximenez, Rodrigo de Henao and four Native Americans from Guacasualco (now Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz) were sent to quell a rebellion and restore order in early 1527. They were attacked by the Natives at Cimatlan taking casualties. Marin presumed all dead but Bernal Diaz del Castillo and Francisco Martin later returned to Guacasualco. These accounts were written by Bernal Diaz del Castillo himself in his well-known memoir \\"The True History of the Conquest of New Spain\\" in which his accounts of this campaign is referenced in detail. After meeting with Cortes, he was granted reinforcements and was able to quell the rebellions in Chiapas and Tabasco.  Later Life  Marin moved back to Mexico City (Tenochtitlan) in 1531. He met and married his wife Maria de Mendoza Arellano who herself was related to Hernan Cortes' second wife. He had eleven children with Maria de Mendoza. In 1539, he was appointed mayor of Mexico City. A year later, he relinquished this position and became Councilman of Mexico City. He continued to receive a stipend of 1,000 gold pesos annually (about 3.383g of gold per peso (coin) which is about US$152,269 in 2019) for his service to the Spanish Crown. He died of unknown causes in 1547 at age 48.

It is a historic private property built by Gregorio Bonici as his secondary residence, and is now owned by the descendants of the Bonici and Testaferrata families. History √Üdes Danielis is a 17th-century country-house, built in 1659 as a secondary residence for the nobleman Gregorio Bonici (1612-1697). Bonici was one of the donors of the land where the parish church now stands. Bonici was a successful trader in the wheat industry and occupied some of the highest civilian positions in Malta. In fact, he was the castellan () of Mdina during the reign of Grandmaster Lascaris. Gregorio Bonici had offered the land in front of Aedes Danielis to build a larger parish church for the locality but, owing to criticism for being distant from some villagers, it was then decided to alternatively donate other land. The family had no children but, similar to other well-to-do families, owned slaves who took care of the household. Two of the slaves were given their freedom after they convinced their owner of their conversion to Christianity and by marrying them to men he approved. His favourite among the former slaves was Angela who was permitted to take Bonici as her surname. She was given freedom and allowed to get married, living a normal life. She and her husband named their son Daniel, who became a priest thanks to a prerequisite sum of money for priesthood donated by Gregorio. Following the death of Gregorio Bonici, his childless wife (Elena Barbara) inherited his assets, including the building which remained her residence until her death three years later. The building later passed to other members of the Bonici family who intermarried with the Testaferrata family, and eventually with the Moroni Viani family. The garage at the back of the property was used as a massive storage for the decorations of the feast of the village, until around WWII. The building was requisitioned by the British army during WWII to be used by servicemen stationed in the area. The garden, forming part of the property, was directly hit by enemy aerial bombing on 11 May 1941, at around 9pm, just before sunset. The nobility was abolished around 1974. The niche of prophet Daniel is centrally located on the fa√ßade. Undenied word of mouth has it that Bonici's brother, Daniele Bonici, was buried alive after being sexually abused by priests in Birgu. Daniele was 14 years at the time of his death - he served as an altar boy and following the abuse the priests opted for a way to seal their criminal deeds. The building is claimed to be named after him, but it is more likely to have been named for the niche of Prophet Daniel, which is centrally located on the main fa√ßade. The building and its chapel were robbed extensively in two separate occasions - once in January 1980 and again in August 1981. In June 1999, Maria Testaferrat Bonici died and she left in her will all the belonging to her three children a third each, including the building. The heirs mentioned in the will are Agnes Gera de Petri, Annamaria Spiteri Debono, and Caren Preziosi. The building was eventually divided into several residences, with different door numbers for the family members. The building is mentioned as an official address in the Paradise Papers. The building is also known as Palazzo Aedes Danielis and Aedes Danielis Palace, however the words palazzo or palace are redundant as the Latin word ‚Äòaedes‚Äô means house. It is known by some locals as the il- Palazz tal-Marki≈ºa (). Architecture The building goes back to the renaissance, originally as a country residence, and is today a landmark welcoming visitors on one of the main streets to the city of ≈ªejtun. The fa√ßade is imposing on its surrounding environment. The building, with its ancillary structures and gardens, is a scheduling property as published on the Government Gazette of Malta of July 2009. A large religious niche, with an imposing life size statue of biblical Prophet Daniel, is a prominent feature on the fa√ßade. The statue is one of only two statues in Malta which are representative of an Old Testament personage. The face of the statue is associated to that of Gregorio Bonici as depicted on a painting located at the Parish Church. The niche is adorned with inscriptions, including dates, and other architectural elements, such as lions‚Äô heads and a coat-of-arms. The latter is a listed national monument. Adjoining the building is a chapel which is dedicated to the Our Lady of Good Counsel. It was built in 1768 to a Baroque design and financed by Enrico Testaferrata. This forms part of the private property and is sometimes opened to the public. The chapel is separately listed as a national monument.

He is most well known for his defense of the view that the Pentateuch was written in its entirety by a team of Jewish scholars working in the Library of Alexandria in 273-272 BCE, who also published the Septuagint Greek translation of the Torah around the same time. This is a much later date of composition than has been traditionally accepted, although a significant minority of scholars now support his Hellenistic dating of the Pentateuch. His father was Vasia Gmirkin, a CIA agent who recruited Soviet defectors and was responsible for the US acquiring night vision technology. While a teenager, Gmirkin attended a small, now-defunct Christian liberal arts college named Ambassador College in Pasadena, California. During his time at Ambassador College, he began to increasingly question the religious doctrine of the university, ultimately leading him to leave before graduating. Gmirkin currently lives in Portland, Oregon. Work =Berossus and Genesis, Manetho and Exodus= Gmirkin first published his case for a Hellenistic dating of the Torah in the 2006 book Berossus and Genesis, Manetho and Exodus. In that book, Gmirkin first seeks to establish that there is no clear evidence of the existence of Pentateuchal writings before their translation into Greek during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus. He points out that the earliest manuscript fragments of the Hebrew Bible date no earlier than the late third century BCE. It is commonly assumed that the earliest non-biblical reference to a written Jewish law is found in Book 40 of Diodorus Siculus's Library,Diodorus Siculus Library, Chapter 40.3-8 an ancient encyclopedia compiled from a variety of quotations from older documents, in a passage which is usually attributed to the fourth-century Greek historian Hecataeus of Abdera, writing around 315 BCE. Gmirkin argues at length that this passage should in fact be attributed to the first-century BCE Roman biographer Theophanes of Mytilene, who in turn used Hecataeus along with other sources, rather than Hecataeus himself. After having established to his own satisfaction that the latest possible date for the composition of the Torah is about 270 BCE, Gmirkin attempts to determine the earliest possible date, using the methods of source criticism. He argues that the books of Genesis and Exodus rely on the Greek-language histories of Berossus (278 BCE) and Manetho (285-280 BCE) and therefore must have been composed subsequently to both of them. =Plato and the Creation of the Hebrew Bible= In 2016, Gmirkin published a second book, Plato and the Creation of the Hebrew Bible, in which he argued that the law code found in the Torah was heavily influenced by Greek laws, and especially the theoretical law code espoused by Plato in his Laws. He further argued that Plato's Laws provided the biblical authors with a basic blueprint for how to transform Jewish society: by creating an authoritative canon of laws and associated literature, drawing on earlier traditions, and presenting them as being divinely inspired and very ancient. Philippe Wajdenbaum has recently argued for a similar conclusion. Criticism John Van Seters criticized Gmirkin's work in a 2007 book review, arguing that Berossus and Genesis engages in a straw man fallacy by attacking the documentary hypothesis without seriously addressing more recent theories of Pentateuchal origins. He also alleges that Gmirkin selectively points to parallels between Genesis and Berossus, and Exodus and Manetho, while ignoring major dissimilarities between the accounts. Finally, Van Seters points out that Gmirkin does not seriously consider the numerous allusions to the Genesis and Exodus narratives in the rest of the Hebrew Bible, including in texts that are generally dated much earlier than his proposed dating of the Pentateuch. Gmirkin, by contrast, holds that those parts of the Hebrew Bible that allude to Genesis and Exodus must be dated later than is commonly assumed. St√©phanie Anthonioz made some criticisms of Plato and the Creation of the Hebrew Bible in a 2017 book review. She argued that the lack of Greek loanwords in the Hebrew dialect used by the biblical authors must be considered as evidence against the idea that the Torah was written in its entirety in the Hellenistic era.

In 1952, Joseph Valachi and others murdered Eugenio Giannini near Correale's club. =Anthony Delasco= Anthony \\"Ham\\" Delasco (sometimes spelled Dolasco) was a former boxer and capo in New Jersey. In the 1950s, he took over The Jersey Crew after Settimo Accardi was deported. Delasco ran his crew from East Orange, New Jersey, where he controlled jukebox machines, cigarette vending machines,Rudolph, p.249-252 illegal gambling and loan-sharking operation in Newark, New Jersey. In the late 1950s, Delasco took Anthony Accetturo as his protege. Delasco died in the late 1960s, his rackets were taken over by Accetturo. =Anthony DiLapi= Anthony DiLapi (February 9, 1936 ‚Äì February 4, 1990), also known as \\"Blue Eyes over the Bridges\\" or \\"Fat Anthony\\", was a soldier. His uncle, Salvatore Santoro, was a former underboss in the Lucchese family.Lawson and Oldham, p.245-252 DiLapi controlled the Lucchese family's Teamsters union in New York City's Garment District and a bookmaking business, and owned part of a vending machine company in Brooklyn. He also worked with Thomas Gambino, the son of Carlo Gambino and son-in-law of Thomas Lucchese, in extorting businesses in the Garment District. After being released from prison, DiLapi was summoned to a meeting with Anthony Casso, and fled. Casso ordered Burton Kaplan to use two NYPD detectives on his payroll, Louis Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa, to track down DiLapi. The two detectives found him in Reseda, California. Vic Amuso and Anthony Casso then ordered Joseph \\"Little Joe\\" D'Arco to kill DiLapi. On February 4, 1990, D'Arco shot DiLapi to death in his Hollywood, California, apartment building's underground garage. DiLapi was shot five times in the face and four times in the body. On April 6, 2006, Eppolito and Caracappa were convicted of murder for their role in eight mob killings, including that of Anthony DiLapi. =Salvatore DiSimone= Salvatore \\"Sally Bo\\" DiSimone (sometimes spelled DeSimone) (died October 2018), was a soldier and former capo. His son Anthony was a member of the Tanglewood Boys. In 1994, his son Anthony went into hiding after the murder of Louis Balancio. In 1999, his son Anthony turned himself in to the police and was sentenced in 2000 to 25 years to life. In 2005, the FBI revealed that DiSimone and Lucchese soldier Daniel Latella had meetings in doctors' offices with Gambino family capo Greg DePalma. His son Anthony DiSimone served seven years in prison before the conviction was overturned; he later pleaded guilty to manslaughter in 2010, and served no additional time. DiSimone's other son Andrew DiSimone became a made member in the Lucchese family. Salvatore DiSimone died in October 2018. =Christopher Furnari= Christopher \\"Christie Tick\\" Furnari, Sr. (April 30, 1924 ‚Äì May 28, 2018) was a former consigliere until his 1986 racketeering conviction. He was sentenced to 100 years in prison before being released in 2014 after serving almost 28 years. In 1924, Christopher Furnari was born in New York to first-generation Sicilian-Italian emigrants from Furnari, a commune in the Province of Messina in Sicily. By age 15, Furnari was managing his own loanshark operations in Brooklyn and Northern New Jersey. By 1943, the 19-year-old Furnari had already served two prison terms for armed robbery. Furnari was also sentenced to 15 to 30 years after he and several other youths were arrested with 3 girls in a car and charged with rape. In 1956, Furnari was released from prison on parole. Furnari became an associate of Gaetano \\"Tommy Three-Finger Brown\\" Lucchese's crime family through Furnari's connection with mobster Anthony Corallo. During the late 1950s, Furnari became involved in illegal gambling and loansharking. Furnari soon became an influential member of the Brooklyn faction of the family and was earning $25,000 a day. In 1962, at age 38, Furnari became a made man in the Lucchese family. In 1964, Furnari became a caporegime. The Lucchese powerbase was traditionally in Manhattan and the Bronx, the family's birthplace; the family's first three bosses, Gaetano \\"Tom\\" Reina, Tommaso \\"Tommy\\" Gagliano, and Thomas Lucchese, were all from this area. In contrast, Furnari belonged to the less influential Brooklyn faction. Furnari operated his crew in Bensonhurst at the 19th Hole, a nondescript bar and mob social club. His crew was involved in illegal gambling, loansharking,https://web.archive.org/web/20060103112838/http://www.geocities.com/mafia_genius2004/1986mobsters.html extortion, burglary, narcotics dealing, occasional murder contracts, & union & construction rackets. At this time, Furnari's criminal record included convictions for assault and sex offenses. Furnari controlled New York District Council 9, which represented 6,000 workers who painted and decorated hotels, bridges, and subway stations in New York. Furnari managed the Council through the union secretary and treasurer, James Bishop, and Bishop's associate, Frank Arnold. Bishop and Arnold would pick up cash payments from the contractors, who charged a 10 to 15 percent tax on all major commercial painting jobs, and passed the payments to Furnari. The 19th Hole, Furnari's social club, was the hub of criminal activity in Bensonhurst. Mobsters from every New York crime family conducted business in the club and socialized over food and drink. In the mid 1960s, aspiring mobsters Vittorio \\"Vic\\" Amuso and Anthony \\"Gaspipe\\" Casso joined Furnari's crew. Furnari saw that both men could make money and were willing to use violence if needed. Furnari put Amuso and Casso in charge of a large bookmaking operation and debt collecting operation. In 1967, family boss Thomas Lucchese died of a brain tumor, leaving the family to be run by an interim boss, Carmine \\"Mr. Gribbs\\" Tramunti.Clines, Francis X. L.I. Police Record A Mafia Funeral - Mourners at Services for Luchese Are Photographed (July 16, 1967) New York Times Lucchese's real successor, Anthony \\"Tony Ducks\\" Corallo, was convicted of bribery in 1967 and sentenced in 1968 to prison for two years. Tramunti served as acting boss, even after Corallo was released from prison in 1970. In 1973, with Tramunti's imprisonment, Corallo finally became the official Lucchese boss. In the early 1970s the Five Families of New York organized crime decided to \\"open the books', allowing a new generation of mob associates to become made men. Furnari immediately sponsored Amuso and Casso for family membership and then made them overseers of the \\"Bypass Gang\\", a highly successful burglary ring. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Bypass Gang reportedly stole hundreds of millions of dollars in cash, jewelry, and other merchandise. In January 1972, Furnari backed and sanctioned the squad of armed robbers who took the famed Pierre Hotel in Manhattan under siege and stole approximately $3 million in jewels and cash. The Pierre Hotel robbery stands as the largest unrecovered hotel robbery in history. None of the perpetrators ever confessed to the heist, and only a diamond necklace valued at $780,000 was recovered. The case was never solved. The eight brazen armed robbers were: Robert Comfort, Sammy Nalo, Donald 'Tony the Greek', Al Green, Ali Ben, Bobby Germain, and Al Visconti. In 1980, Furnari was promoted to consigliere in the Lucchese family. He wanted Casso to take over as capo of the 19th Hole crew, but Casso declined and endorsed Amuso instead. Casso opted to become Furnari's aide; a consigliere is allowed to have one soldier work directly for him. Furnari now enjoyed enormous influence both within his own family, the other New York families, and crime families from other US cities. Furnari continued to oversee his criminal interests from the 19th Hole, but spent much of his time providing advise and mediation for family members as well as settling disputes with the other families. Furnari reigned as one of New York's top Mafia bosses throughout the early 1980s until his 1985 racketeering indictment. On February 25, 1985, Furnari was indicted in the Mafia Commission case, the most comprehensive Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) prosecution brought against the mob at the time. Furnari was indicted as a result of a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) probe that used undercover surveillance and bugging techniques against the mob leaders. The bug that snared Furnari had been placed in Salvatore Avellino's Jaguar car. FBI surveillance recorded Corallo conducting business with Furnari and other family leaders. Pleading not guilty to the charges, Furnari was released on $1.75 million bail pending trial. In early 1986, while Furnari was awaiting the Commission trial, the Lucchese family uncovered a new, protentially lucrative racket. A Russian-American crime family based in Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, run by Ukrainian immigrant Marat Balagula, had started to bootleg gasoline. By collecting gasoline taxes from customers and then not paying them to the government, Balagula was making very large profits. When Colombo crime family capo Michael Franzese started pressing Balagula for extortion payments, Balagula went to Furnari for help. Casso later reported on a meeting at the 19th Hole, in which Furnari told Balagula, > Here there's enough for everybody to be happy... to leave the table > satisfied. What we must avoid is trouble between us and the other families. > I propose to make a deal with the others so there's no bad blood.... > Meanwhile, we will send word out that from now on you and your people are > with the Lucchese family. No one will bother you. If anyone does bother you, > come to us and Anthony will take care of it. As a result of the 19th Hole meeting, the Five Families imposed a two cent per gallon \\"Family tax\\" on Balagula's bootlegging operation, which became their greatest moneymaker after drug trafficking. According to one former associate, > The LCN reminded Marat of the apparatchiks in the Soviet Union. He thought > as long as he gave them something they would be valuable allies. Then all of > a sudden he was at risk of being killed if he couldn't pay to the > penny.Robert Friedman, \\"Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob has Invaded > America,\\" 2000. Pages 53-54. According to author Philip Carlo, > It didn't take long for word on the street to reach the Russian underworld: > Marat Balagula was paying off the Italians; Balagula was a punk; Balagula > had no balls. Balagula's days were numbered. This, of course, was the > beginning of serious trouble. Balagula did in fact have balls -- he was a > ruthless killer when necessary -- but he also was a smart diplomatic > administrator and he knew that the combined, concerted force of the Italian > crime families would quickly wipe the newly arrived Russian competition off > the proverbial map.Philip Carlo, \\"Gaspipe: Confessions of a Mafia Boss,\\" > 2008, page 152. On June 12, 1986, one of Balagula's rivals, Russian gangster Vladimir Reznikov, entered Balagula's nightclub in Brighton Beach. Reznikov pushed a 9mm Beretta handgun against Balagula's skull and demanded $600,000 and a percentage of Balagula's rackets. After Balagula acceded to his demands, Reznikov told him, \\"Fuck with me and you're dead -- you and your whole fucking family; I swear I'll fuck and kill your wife as you watch -- you understand?\\" After Reznikov left the nightclub, Balagula suffered a massive heart attack. He insisted, however, on being treated at his home in Brighton Beach, where he felt safer. At home, Balagula asked Casso to come help him. Casso gave these instructions to Balagula, \\"Send word to Vladimir that you have his money, that he should come to the club tomorrow. We'll take care of the rest.\\"Philip Carlo, \\"Gaspipe: The Confessions of a Mafia Boss,\\" 2008, page 154. Casso also requested a photograph of Reznikov and a description of his car. The next day, Reznikov arrived at Balagula's nightclub to pick up his money. Lucchese soldier Joseph Testa confronted Reznikov and fatally shot him. According to Casso, \\"After that, Marat didn't have any problems with other Russians.\\" In September 1986, Furnari went on trial in the famous New York Mafia Commission case along with Corallo and underboss Salvatore \\"Tom Mix\\" Santoro. The charges included extortion and labor racketeering within the construction industry and murder for hire of former Bonanno crime family boss Carmine \\"Lilo\\" Galante. Galante had been gunned down on July 12, 1979 allegedly on the orders of the Commission. Some have argued that Furnari wasn't on the Commission then and had no connection with the Galante hit. However, Furnari could not use this as a defense argument. By the fall of 1986, Corallo realized that he, Santoro and Furnari would not only be convicted, but were facing sentences that would all but assure they would die in prison. Furnari persuaded Corallo that either Amuso or Casso should become the new boss. At a meeting in Furnari's home, Furnari, Amuso and Casso all agreed that Amuso should succeed Corallo as boss. On November 19, 1986 Furnari was convicted on all counts, including the Galante murder. On January 13, 1987, Furnari was sentenced to 100 years in prison without parole and fined $240,000.\\"JUDGE SENTENCES 8 MAFIA LEADERS TO PRISON TERMS\\" By ARNOLD H. LUBASCH New York Times January 14, 1987 With the imprisonment of Corallo and Furnari, Amuso became boss, and Casso became consigliere and later underboss. Peter \\"Fat Pete\\" Chiodo took over Furnari's Bensonhurst crew. In 1990, Amuso and Casso became fugitives to avoid prosecution in the famous \\"Windows Case.\\" In 1992, Amuso was captured and sentenced to life in prison. In 1993, Casso was also captured; however, in 1994 he struck a deal with the government to testify against Furnari and other family leaders. In 1995, Furnari started challenging the \\"no parole\\" stipulation of his sentence in court. The government had previously revoked Casso's witness deal with prosecutors, and in 1996 Casso was sentenced to life in prison. Furnari's lawyers insisted that Casso's court testimony against Furnari was tainted. In July 2000, the Third Circuit Federal Court of Appeals ruled that the parole board officials had been denying Furnari's parole eligibility on the tainted assertions of mob turncoat Casso. However, in 2001, the Bureau of Prisons National Appeal Board ruled that Furnari was a multiple murderer and was not eligible for parole, based on what some people considered to be Casso's discredited testimony. On February 15, 2006, Furnari filed a habeas corpus petition in District Court claiming that the United States parole commission improperly had denied him parole. On June 20, 2007, the court denied his petition. Furnari was imprisoned in the Allenwood Medium Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. His projected release date was November 24, 2044, effectively a life sentence. However, since he was convicted before Congress eliminated parole for federal prisoners, he and his co-defendants became eligible for parole in 1996. Furnari was the only defendant to be granted early release by the U.S. Parole Commission, most likely relating to the weak evidence behind his murder conviction. Furnari was released from a prison hospital in Minnesota on September 19, 2014 after serving 28 years. On May 28, 2018, Furnari died at his home in Staten Island, New York. =Stefano LaSalle= Stefano \\"Steve\\" LaSalle (real name LaSalaCritchley, p.130-131) was an early member of the Morello family; he later joined Reina's family.Critchley, p. 111‚Äì113 In 1915, East Harlem's Italian lottery \\"king\\" Giosue Gallucci was murdered, allowing LaSalle and Tommaso Lomonte to take over the lottery games. LaSalle served as underboss to Thomas Lucchese and later Carmine Tramunti, until he retired in the 1970s. =Anthony Loria Sr.= Anthony \\"Tony\\" Loria Sr., also known as \\"Tony Aboudamita\\", was a mobster who played a major role in the French Connection heroin scandal. Loria, along with his longtime partner Vincent Papa and his crew, are known as \\"The Men who Stole The French Connection\\". Loria was known to federal agents and the BNDD as a major drug trafficker within the Lucchese Crime Family. He was convicted in 1961 of trafficking heroin but his conviction was overturned on appeal in 1968 because of violations of the Fourth Amendment. He was implicated along with Papa, Anthony Passero, Virgil Alessi and Frank D'Amato in the New York Police Department scandal, in which over $70 million worth of drugs seized during the French Connection operation was stolen from the police property room. The crew stole 398 pounds of heroin and 120 pounds of cocaine from 1969 to 1972. In October 1973, Loria was indicted, along with the boss of the Lucchese Family Carmine Tramunti and 42 other mobsters, on drug dealing charges. He died in 1989 from natural causes. =Joseph Lucchese= Joseph \\"Joe Brown\\" Lucchese was a capo and brother to Tommy Lucchese the boss of the Lucchese crime family.

He died during the early 1970s. =Anthony Luongo= Anthony \\"Buddy\\" Luongo was a former capo. In 1986, Luongo tried to take over the Lucchese crime family after boss Anthony Corallo was imprisoned during the Commission case. In December 1986, Luongo met Vic Amuso, Anthony Casso, Bobby Amuso and Dom Carbucci in Brooklyn, where Bobby Amuso shot Luongo dead.Carlo, p. 166 =Mariano Macaluso= Mariano \\"Mac\\" Macaluso (born June 7, 1912) was a former member. He served as consigliere during the 1960s.Critchley, p. 45 In 1986, after the Mafia Commission Trial, Macaluso became the new underboss.United States Senate, One Hundredth Congress p. 897 In 1989, boss Vic Amuso forced him into retirement.Raab, p. 482-483 In 1992, he died from natural causes. =Frank Manzo= FBI surveillance photograph Frank Manzo (February 2, 1925 ‚Äì October 23, 2012), also known as \\"Francesco Manzo\\", \\"Frank Manse\\", and \\"Frankie the Wop\\", was a soldier in the Vario Crew who oversaw the family's interests at John F. Kennedy International Airport (\\"JFK\\") in Queens, New York.Jacobs, p. 48‚Äì50 He served as a union delegate in the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, controlled Local 295 and owned two trucking companies: LVF Air Cargo, Inc., and LVF Airport Service Inc. at JFK Airport.Jacobs, p. 59 Manzo also owned Villa Capra, a restaurant in Cedarhurst, New York, where he conducted illegal activities.Pileggi, p. 35 In 1972, Manzo was kidnapped by James McBratney, Eddie Maloney, Tommy Genovese, and Richie Chaisson; they held him for $150,000 in ransom, then released him when it was paid. In 1983, Manzo was overheard in an FBI wiretap, saying, \\"We rule this airport\\". In 1985, Manzo along with Local 295 President Frank Calise, Local 851 Vice-President Harry Davidoff, and others were indicted on charges of extorting shipping and trucking companies at JFK Airport.Jacobs, p. 61 In 1986, Manzo pleaded guilty to racketeering and was sentenced to twelve years in prison and fined $325,000. On April 8, 1987, Manzo was banned from New Jersey casinos due to his history of involvement with organized crime. Manzo was released from prison in 1994. In 1995, Manzo was charged with racketeering for extorting $2 million in payoffs from cement company owner John Quadrozzi over a 13-year period, between 1978 and 1991. However, the charges were dropped when the judge ruled that the crimes were covered under his 1986 plea agreement. On October 23, 2012, Manzo died in his sleep. =Aniello Migliore= Aniello \\"Neil\\" Migliore (October 1933 ‚Äì September 11, 2019) was a made man. He served as a capo, as the consigliere, as the underboss and on a ruling panel in the family. Migliore was a close associate of family bosses Tommy Lucchese and Anthony Corallo. Migliore was born in October 1933 in Queens, New York.Newton, pp.92 He was recruited into Lucchese family by capo Joseph Laratro, who controlled illegal gambling operations in Corona, Queens. By the late 1950s Migliore, a soldier, already was overseeing Laratro's illegal gambling operations from bookmaking, policy operations and large telephone setups.The Committee, 1971 pp.196Liddick, pp.183 In 1957, it was reported that after paying tribute to his boss, Migliore was making $50,000 a day from running illegal gambling operations in New York City. On November 14, 1957, Migliore was suspected of driving boss Tommy Lucchese and underboss Steve LaSalle to the famous Apalachin Meeting, a national Cosa Nostra summit in Apalachin, New York that was broken up by law enforcement.Reavill, p.90 The next day on November 15, 1957 Migliore was in a car accident while driving through Binghamton, New York leading to more suspicion that he was supposed to attend the Apalachin Meeting.Newton, p.110 On October 22, 1974, Migliore was indicted, along with members Frank Altimari, Nicholas Bonina, Anthony Romanello, Frank Ruggiero, Richard Rubino, Thomas DeMaio, brothers Michael Struzzieri and William Struzzieri, and NYPD Police Officer James Maxwell, on bribery charges =][ in order to protect a gambling operation in Queens. Migliore as a capo represented the family's interest in Northberry Concrete, a Brooklyn based contractor and member of the New York City's Concrete club.Goldstock, pp.85 He also held a salesman position with \\"Port Dock and Stone\\" one of the main suppliers of trap rock to the two companies that controlled the production of concrete in New York City. On March 21, 1986, Migliore was indicted along with Genovese family acting boss Anthony Salerno, Genovese family captains Vincent Cafaro, Vincent DiNapoli and Giuseppe Sabato, Genovese family members Louis DiNapoli, Carmine Della Cava and Thomas Cafaro, and Cleveland family members John Tronolone and Milton Rockman, Gambino family member Alphonse Mosca, and four businessmen, Edward J. Halloran, Nicholas Auletta, Alvin O. Chattin, and Richard Costa, on extortion and bid rigging charges. The charges alleged Migliore and other mobsters had rigged the bidding process for the supplying of concrete to high rise building projects in Manhattan such as the Trump Plaza and sites for Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. In November 1986, The New York Times reported Migliore a captain and owner of a Queens marble business who also controlled gambling operations with Joe Lucchese (the brother of former boss Thomas Lucchese) replaced Anthony Corallo as the new boss of the Lucchese family, after Corallo was convicted during the Commission trial. Former Lucchese mobster Alphonse D'Arco revealed that Vic Amuso was chosen as the new family boss and Migliore served as consigliere before being replaced by Anthony Casso, when Migliore went to prison.Capeci, Robbins p.202 On May 4, 1988, Migliore was convicted was sentenced to 24 years in prison and fined $266,000.

On April 3, 1992, Migliore was celebrating the birthday of a friend's granddaughter at Tesoro's Restaurant in Westbury, Long Island. During the party, a shooter in a passing car fired shotgun blasts through the restaurant window. Migliore was struck in the neck and upper body. Despite his wounds, Migliore survived.Capeci, Robbins p.375 On May 14, 1997 Migliore was released from prison. In 2003, it was reported by author Jerry Capeci that the Lucchese crime family was being run by a three-man ruling committee consisting of Migliore, Matthew Madonna, and Joseph DiNapoli in the absence of an acting boss. Migliore, who served as underboss in the past to Anthony Corallo, was considered the biggest influence on the ruling committee.Haugen, p.19 Migliore died on September 11, 2019. =Richard Pagliarulo= Richard \\"Toupe\\" Pagliarulo (November 30, 1948 ‚Äì 1999) was a former capo who took over as capo of Peter Chiodo's old Bensonhurst crew.

Papa ran his criminal operations from Ditmars Car Service, in Astoria, Queens, and from the Astoria Colts Social Club. He worked closely with mobsters Anthony Loria and Virgil Alessi. Between 1969 and 1972, New York Police Department detectives James Farley, Joseph Nunziata, Frank King and others were paid by Papa to steal approximately $70 million in confiscated narcotics (heroin) from the New York City Police Property Clerk's office in Lower Manhattan. Papa was arrested on February 3, 1972, in a car parked on Bronxdale Avenue with Joseph DiNapoli in the back seat. There was a suitcase with $967,500 in hundred dollar bills. In 1975, Papa was convicted and sent to the Atlanta Federal Prison in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1977, Papa was stabbed to death in prison. He is buried in St. John's Cemetery in Queens. Papa's infamous theft became famous after the movie French Connection II. =Joseph Pinzolo= Bonaventura \\"Joseph\\" Pinzolo (1887 ‚Äì September 5, 1930), also known as \\"Fat Joe\\", was the boss of the family during 1930. In July 1908, Pinzolo was arrested for trying to bomb 314 East 11th Street in an effort to force owner Francisco Spinelli to pay Black Hand extortion demands.Critchley, p.29 After his arrest Pinzolo, gave up his boss Giuseppe Costabile, a Camorrista who controlled the area south of Houston Street to Canal Street and from East Broadway to the East River. Pinzolo served 2 years and 8 months to 5 years after refusing to testify against Costabile. In February 1930, Gaetano Reina was murdered and boss Joseph Masseria backed Pinzolo to take control of the Reina family. Pinzolo may have been responsible for Reina's murder, though the most widely suspected culprit for that crime remains Vito Genovese.Sifakis, p. 277 As boss Pinzolo was unfamiliar with the members of the family and the East Harlem area.Critchley, p.176 His promotion angered Tommaso Gagliano, Tommy Lucchese and Dominick Petrilli, who formed a splinter group within the family and planned his murder.Maas, p.65-67 On September 5, 1930, Pinzolo's body was found in the Brokaw building on 1487 Broadway in Suite 1007 occupied by California Dry Fruit Importers. The office was leased by Tommy Lucchese four months earlier.Critchley, p.181 According to Joseph Valachi the killer was Girolamo Santuccio. Valachi also mentioned that after Pinzolo's assassination a meeting was held on Staten Island to uncover who was responsible for the murder. =Vincenzo Rao= Vincenzo John Rao (June 21, 1898 Palermo, Sicily ‚Äì September 25, 1988),Giancana p.602 also known as Vincent or Vinny, was a former Consigliere in the family.

Rao became a powerful mobster in the lathing industry. He became partners in Five Boro Hoisting Company, United Lathing Company, Westchester Lathing Corporation and Ace Lathing Company operating from the Bronx and Westchester. In the 1950s, boss Gaetano Lucchese promoted Rao to Consigliere in the family. In 1957, Rao was arrested with 60 other mobsters at the abortive Apalachin meeting in rural Apalachin, New York. When asked by investigators why he was at the meeting, Rao said he went there for the luncheon buffet and did not speak to anyone else because he was not \\"introduced\\". During the 1963 Valachi hearings, Rao was listed as the Lucchese family's consigliere. In 1965, Rao was convicted on perjury charges and was sentenced to five years in prison. At the same time the longtime boss Thomas Lucchese had become ill and Rao was thought as suitable successor. His chance to become the new boss never came to fruition due to his trials. During the early 1970s, Rao retired. On September 25, 1988, Rao died of natural causes and is buried at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. =Salvatore Santoro= Salvatore T. \\"Tom Mix\\" Santoro, Sr. (November 18, 1915 Bureau of Narcotics, Sam Giancana, The United States Treasury Department.

He earned the nickname \\"Tom Mix\\" because in his younger years he closely resembled the Dutch-German-American western film actor by that name.Capeci, Jerry. \\"The complete idiot's guide to the Mafia.\\" (pg. 419) Santoro started working for the Gagliano crime family, forerunner of the Lucchese family, in the early 1930s. He served as an associate of future boss Tommy \\"Three-Finger Brown\\" Lucchese's 107th Street gang Volkman, Ernest. \\"Ganbusters: The Destruction of America's Last Great Mafia Dynasty\\". (1998) (pg. 131) in operating extortion, loansharking, narcotics and prostitution rings during the 1930s. He was made sometime in the 1940s operating drug trafficking and loansharking rings. On July 6, 1942, Santoro received six months to two years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to import narcotics from Mexico. In March 1951, Santoro was indicted on charges of conspiracy to import opium from Mexico and convert it into heroin. Santoro went into hiding and allegedly spent time in Europe before returning to Oyster Bay, New York. On September 24, 1951, he surrendered to federal authorities in New York City. On January 7, 1952, after pleading guilty to narcotics charges, a judge labeled Santoro as a \\"bad fellow\\" and sentenced him to four years in prison. In 1951 or 1953, longtime boss Tommy Gagliano died. Underboss Tommy Lucchese took over what was now called the Lucchese crime family. Lucchese then promoted Santoro to capo of the family's powerful Bronx faction. As capo Santoro operated out of East Harlem and the Bronx controlling large heroin drug trafficking operations during the 1950s. In 1958 he was arrested and tried for narcotics charges. He was alleged to be a partner and associate of Ellsworth Johnson, although this never was confirmed. Santoro was convicted of all charges in 1959 and was given a twenty-year prison sentence. When Santoro was released from prison in 1978 he took over as underboss, continuing to oversee the powerful Bronx faction of the family. He left the drug trade alone and instead took over the labor and construction racketeering operations for the family in New York City. Santoro gained a reputation as a labor racketeer and worked with consigliere Christopher Furnari and other top capos in the family. He bought a home on City Island Avenue in City Island, Bronx.Mckelvey, Gerald; and Hurtado, Patricia.\\"Mob's Commission Is Guilty on All Counts Family Heads Facing Heavy Prisons Terms\\", Newsday, November 20, 1986. Accessed October 16, 2009. \\"...underboss Salvatore Santoro, 71, of 90 City Island Ave., Bronx...\\" In the early 1980s, Anthony Corallo found a new way to discuss business without ever meeting his top underlings Santoro and Furnari. Corallo used his Jaguar with a phone inside and talked to mostly Santoro on the phone while he was driving around in New York with his chauffeur Aniello Migliore. This succeeded mostly because the noise of the old Jaguar was so loud that it was not possible to hear what Corallo and others were saying. However, after the Jaguar came with a new engine and new filter, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents planted a bug in it, and listened in to Corallo's conversations with Santoro, mostly about the profit from the labor and construction racketeering operations in the Bronx, where they extorted unions and had influence in the construction industry. As US law enforcement undertook a concerted effort to crush organized crime activities in New York City during the mid-1980s, they put eleven top members of the Five Families, including the entire leadership of the Lucchese crime family, Corallo, Santoro and consigliere Christopher \\"Christie Tick\\" Furnari, on trial, called the Mafia Commission Trial or the Commission Case. The defendants were arrested on February 25, 1985 on various charges, including labor racketeering, extortion, loansharking, illegal gambling and murder. The trial began in September 1986. The charges also involved the execution of Bonanno crime family de facto boss Carmine Galante in 1979, allegedly on the orders of the Commission because they saw Galante as a potential rival who planned to take over all organized crime operations in the New York area. On November 19, 1986, Santoro and the other defendants were convicted on all counts. On January 13, 1987, Santoro was sentenced to 100 years in prison and fined $250,000. In January 2000, Santoro died at age 87 of natural causes at a medical center for federal prisoners. Months later Corallo died in August 2000. =Patrick Testa= Patrick \\"Patty\\" Testa is a former soldier. Testa was the younger brother to Joseph Testa. In 1984, he was indicted on fraud and theft charges along with members of the Gambino family's DeMeo crew. Testa was sentenced to two years in prison and after his release joined the Lucchese crime family. On December 2, 1992, Testa was murdered, shot in the back of the head nine times. It was later revealed that Anthony Casso had ordered Frank Lastorino to murder Testa. =Anthony Tortorello= Anthony \\"Torty\\" Tortorello a former capo of the \\"Prince Street crew\\". In 1986, Tortorello was overheard by Genovese mobster asking why Vincent Gigante was upset by drug deals when Gigante himself profited from drug deals. When Gigante heard these statements demand Tortoello's death, but Anthony Casso was able to save his life by planning a phony beating of Tortorello to appeal Gigante demand. In October 1991, Tortorello along with Frank Lastorino, Anthony Baratta, Salvatore Avellino, Richard Pagliarulo, George Conte, Thomas Anzellotto and Frank Papagni inducted (made) Joseph Tortorello, Thomas D'Ambrosia, Frank Gioia Jr., Gregory Cappello and Jody Calabrese into the crime family during a ceremony that was held in a Howard Beach, Queens home.

In the attack, Telvi had burned himself badly on the right side of his face and neck with some of the acid that splashed on him. He was paid $1,175 in cash and began demanding more money from Dio.Sifakis, p.439 On July 28, 1956, Telvi was found dead on Mulberry Street with a bullet in his head. =Vincent Zito= Vincent Zito (1941 ‚Äì October 26, 2018) is a former loanshark and associate of the Lucchese family.

Government informants and witnesses =Peter Chiodo= FBI surveillance photograph of Chiodo, Lastorino and Baratta Peter \\"Fat Pete\\" Chiodo (1951‚Äì2016) was a capo in the Lucchese crime family who later became a government witness. In 1987, Chiodo became a made man in the Lucchese family in a ceremony held in an apartment over a funeral home in Queens. In 1989, Chiodo became a capo in charge of funneling payoffs from Local 580 of the Ironworkers' Union to the Lucchese leadership. He was known as \\"Fat Pete\\" because of his enormous girth‚Äì to , depending on the source. In 1989, the Lucchese family began worrying about indictments from the Windows case. The Luccheses and three other New York families had participated in a window replacement scheme that stole millions of dollars from the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA). Worried that construction union leader John Morrissey might testify for the prosecution, family leaders ordered Chiodo to lure Morrissey to New Jersey, where he was murdered.\\"A Lawyer for Gigante Lambastes a Witness\\" New York Times July 2, 1997 In 1991, Chiodo was charged with violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) in the Windows case. Chiodo realized that the government's case was so solid that he would likely die in prison if convicted. He decided to plead guilty in return for a lighter sentence. However, Chiodo did not ask Lucchese official boss Vittorio \\"Vic\\" Amuso and official underboss Anthony \\"Gaspipe\\" Casso for permission to take a plea. Amuso and Casso were both in hiding due to the Windows case. Suspecting Chiodo was about to turn informer, Amuso and Casso ordered him killed. Casso gave the contract to acting boss Alphonse 'Little Al' D'Arco. The order shocked D'Arco, who knew that Chiodo had been a close confidant of Casso for years. On May 8, 1991 two shooters ambushed Chiodo at a gas station in Staten Island where he was working on a car. Chiodo received 12 bullet wounds in the arms, legs, and torso, but survived the attack.\\"Window Case Figure Shot and Wounded by Pair of Gunmen\\" New York Times May 9, 1991 Doctors credited Chiodo's massive girth for saving his life; none of the slugs penetrated a vital organ or artery.\\"People Do Whatever They Feel Like\\" New York Magazine Jan 9, 1995 page 26 However, he suffered several abdominal wounds and a disabled right arm.Raab, p. 497. Chiodo had anticipated that he was in Amuso and Casso's bad books; he knew that Amuso and Casso had a habit of \\"marking guys rats and killing them.\\" Just before the hit, he told D'Arco that he'd gotten word that \\"you and I are going to be killed and hurt.\\"Raab, p. 499. Following the unsuccessful assassination attempt, Lucchese mobsters delivered a blunt threat to Chiodo's lawyer that they would kill Chiodo's wife if he testified, a violation of a longstanding Mafia rule against harming women. While Chiodo had turned down several offers to flip, the threat against his wife was the last straw. He opted to break his blood oath and become a government witness, by his own account, to protect his family.\\"Witness in Bid Rigging Case Tells of Mob Threat to his Wife's Life\\" New York Times September 17, 1991 The government quickly brought Chiodo's immediate family into the federal Witness Protection Program. With the failure of his gunmen to murder Chiodo, D'Arco soon became afraid of the wrath of his bosses. After a 1991 meeting during which he feared being murdered, D'Arco went into hiding and soon became a government witness himself. In September 1991, using a wheelchair due to his wounds, Chiodo testified in the Windows trial. Chiodo stated that he had undergone a \\"transformation\\" from a violent criminal to a man with a conscience. When asked what prompted this transformation, Chiodo replied \\"I was shot 12 times.\\" Chiodo's remaining family in Brooklyn soon suffered retaliation from the Luccheses. On March 10, 1992, Lucchese associate Michael Spinelli shot Patricia Capozallo, Chiodo's sister, while she was driving in Bensonhurst. Capozallo suffered wounds to the arm, back and neck but survived.\\"HIT TARGET RECALLS HOW SHE DUCKED RUBOUT ATTEMPT\\" New York Daily News November 4, 1998\\"MOBSTER TRIAL OPENS WITH TOILET TALK\\" New York Daily News November 3, 1998 On February 2, 1993, the body of Frank Signorino, Chiodo's uncle, was found in the trunk of a car in East New York. The body displayed several gunshot wounds to the head.\\"Uncle of Mafia Informant is Found Slain in Brooklyn\\" New York Times February 3, 1993 Chiodo provided valuable evidence that helped convict both Amuso and Casso as well as many other gangsters. While testifying in different cities, the government had to fly Chiodo in a special plane due to his morbid obesity.\\"Peter (Big Pete) Chiodo sentenced 17 years after arrest\\" New York Daily News September 11, 2007 In July 1997, Chido testified against Genovese crime family boss Vincent Gigante in another Windows-related racketeering trial.\\"JURY GETS CHIN CASE, EYES SCAM\\" New York Daily News July 24, 1997 On September 11, 2007, Chiodo was sentenced to 17 years in prison on racketeering charges.

On February 4, 1990, he shot DiLapi to death in his Hollywood, California apartment building's underground garage. In September 1991, D'Arco's father became a marked man (being targeted for death), and, fearing for his own life, surrendered to the F.B.I. and agreed to become a witness. =Joseph DeFede= Joseph \\"Little Joe\\" DeFede (1934 ‚Äì July 15, 2012) was a former New York City mobster and acting boss of the Lucchese crime family who eventually turned informant. Born in 1934, DeFede grew up in the Queens borough of New York City. In his early days, he operated a hot dog vendor truck in Coney Island, Brooklyn, running numbers rackets on the side. A close friend and handball partner of Lucchese leader Vittorio \\"Vic\\" Amuso, DeFede was inducted into the family in 1986 after Amuso became boss. DeFede's rise and fall in the New York mob can all be attributed to Amuso. In 1994, Amuso was convicted of federal racketeering and murder charges and sent to prison for life. Amuso then named DeFede his acting boss to replace Alphonse D'Arco with a weaker and more controllable man at the top, after D'Arco became a government witness. On April 28, 1998, DeFede was indicted on nine counts of racketeering stemming from his supervision of the family rackets in New York's Garment District from 1991 to 1996. The prosecution reported that the Lucchese family had been grossing $40,000 per month from Garment District businesses since the mid-1980s. In December 1998, DeFede pleaded guilty to the charges and received five years in prison. During the late '90s, Amuso's relationship with DeFede began to sour. Suspecting that DeFede was hiding money from the family, Amuso replaced him as acting boss with Steven Crea, head of the family's powerful Bronx faction. Once Crea took over, family profits rose enormously. That was enough to convince Amuso that DeFede had been skimming profits; Amuso reportedly decided to have him murdered. On February 5, 2002, DeFede was released from a Lexington, Kentucky prison medical center. Having heard of Amuso's plans to kill him, DeFede immediately became a government informant. DeFede provided details concerning the Garment District rackets and the protection rackets in Howard Beach, Queens. He also provided information leading to the convictions of Crea, Louis Daidone, Dominic Truscello, Joseph Tangorra, Anthony Baratta, and a number of family captains, soldiers and associates. While testifying against Gambino crime family boss Peter Gotti, DeFede testified that he only earned $1,014,000, or approximately $250,000 per year, during his tenure as acting boss. DeFede also estimated that a low ranking family soldier would make on average $50,000 per year. DeFede entered and left the Witness Protection Program, moving to live in Florida under an assumed name. He and his wife reportedly lived on $30,000 a year and a modest annuity provided by the U.S. Marshals Service, their assets having been depleted by legal bills and the cost of creating new identities. On July 15, 2012 DeFede died from a heart attack. =Donald Frankos= Donald \\"Tony the Greek\\" George Frankos, (born November 10, 1938 Hackensack, New Jersey ‚Äì died March 30, 2011 Dannemora, New York), was a Greek-Italian contract killer and mob associate of the Lucchese family, who later became a government witness.

It has been asserted that he sealed the body in an oil drum and buried it underneath Giants Stadium, however no evidence has ever been found to substantiate this claim.Jeannette Walls. \\"Can Playboy's Canary be trusted\\". New York Magazine. October 16, 1989.

The novel, which is considered to be a magnum opus of Butchi Babu, tells the story of Dayanidhi, a doctor with a mother fixation, and the difficulties he experiences after her death. Background Chivaraku Migiledi was serialized in Navodaya during 1946‚Äì1947, and was published as a book in 1952. An abridged version was published in 1957 by the Southern Language Book Trust and became a best seller. It tells the story of Dayanidhi, a doctor with a mother fixation, and the difficulties he experiences after his mother's death. Dayanidhi's search for a lover and life-partner is entangled in larger conflicts with his social world until he reassess his life, rekindles a relationship with a woman he once tried to date, and establishes an independent life with her. Characters The principle characters of the novel are: * Dayanidhia medical student and later medical practitioner * Dasaratha RamayyaDayanidhi's father * Komali, Amritam and Indira * Susilaa cousin of Dayanidhi * Anantacharlua political worker who befriends Dayanidhi Plot The novel is set in Andhra Pradesh's West Godavari district between 1933 and 1940. The protagonist Dayanindhi takes time off from his medical studies to visit his native village, where he finds his mother and elder brother, who has just married and lives there with his wife, are always squabbling. The story begins with his faithful old servant telling Dayanindhi the couple have deserted their home after one final quarrel. Although Dayanidhi identifies deeply with his mother, he does not rush home but goes to find Komali, a woman who fascinates him and whom his mother wants him to marry. After being rebuffed, Dayanidhi spends time at a circus and, when he decides to go back home late at night, encounters his father, who tells Dayanidhi his mother has been promiscuous. When Dayanidhi and his father return to the family home, they discover Dayanidhi's mother is dead. The incident becomes a pivotal moment in Dayanidhi's life. Dayanidhi continues his college studies. On another visit to his former home, he meets his cousins Susila and Amritam. Though the family would like him to marry Susila, he is discouraged by her hostile attitude to his deceased mother and snide references to Komali. Amritam, who is married, makes a good impression on Dayanidhi, who likes her affectionate nature and her lack of hostility towards Komali. On a picnic, Komali asks Dayanidhi for 50 rupees, ostensibly for her mother, and asks him to visit her house that night. Dayanidhi borrows the sum from Amritam. When he finds Komali asleep, he avoids the temptation of touching her and slips the money under her pillow. Komali promptly leaves with a wealthy man. It emerges that Komali's mother wants to live off her daughter's earnings. Eventually, Dayanidhi's father arranges for him to marry Indira, whose father is a policeman. Amritam provides Dayanidhi with a wedding ring. Just prior to the consummation of their marriage, Dayanidhi chances upon an anti-British public meeting and gets up to harangue people on the virtues of freedom but is injured when the police charge in and requires hospitalization. Only Amritam visits him as he recovers; his prospective father-in-law will have nothing to do with someone who preaches against the British authorities. Having recovered, Dayanidhi sets up a medical practice in the coastal town of Eluru but stories about his mother and his own broken marriage persist in causing him problems, especially after he begins treating a friend's mentally ill sister. Dayanidhi moves to Rayalaseema, where he volunteers to assist victims of the plague that is ravaging the area. When Amritam visits him, they have sex as a tempest sweeps through the town and his sexual inhibitions are suddenly mastered. While following a local political leader Anantacharlu during a stay in Vajrakarur, Dayanidhi digs up a large diamond, which he sells and uses the money to found a hospital and, together with Anantacharlu, open up new mines. Komali learns of Dayanidhi's good fortune and arrives, promising to stay with him all her life, but he stops short of consummating their relationship. Hearing his wife Indira is dying of tuberculosis, Dayanidhi visits her to perform the last rites. On returning, he visits Amritam, who has just given birth, and suspects the new baby might be his own. Local outrage over Dayanidhi's mining and his illicit relationship with Komali eventually forment an uprising in which his home is burnt down, and he is forced to flee with Komali, his first love. Dayanidhi realizes she is, in a sense, a mirror of his own pursuit of freedom and that they can live together, embodying the independence both have always sought. Analysis In Chivaraku Migiledi, the story of Dayanidhi starts with a psychological problem and ends in self-realization. After the death of his mother, Dayanidhi becomes alienated from the society and his self. When Komali returns, he finds his true self and his mother's image is enshrined in his psyche. He concludes the end of the journey is in coming to terms with oneself and accepting the image of one's psyche, which leads to peace with the outside world. Reception Chivaraku Migiledi is considered to be a magnum opus of Butchi Babu; critics praised it for its study of human psychology. It was translated into English by Kakani Chakrapani as Ultimate Remanence and included in Four Classics of Telugu Fiction.

It aims to address the high rates of injury and low rates of prehospital emergency care available in the country.  History  The signed FRCSL constitution Deployed to explore the creation of prehospital emergency care systems in Sierra Leone, LFR International initially proposed a coalition to national partners to address the lack of prehospital emergency care available. The five founding member organizations later came together in Makeni, a town in Bombali District in the Northern Province of Sierra Leone, to establish a formal coalition, which was called the \\"First Responder Coalition of Sierra Leone.\\" The Coalition's official mission is to \\"facilitate the development of emergency first responder programs to alleviate the burden of traumatic injury in Sierra Leone.\\" The five founding members were the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society, LFR International, the University of Makeni, Agency for Rural Community Transformation (ARCT), and Holy Spirit Hospital. The Red Cross was the initial chairing organization of the coalition. Members wrote a constitution to officially establish the coalition, which was formally signed into existence on June 27, 2019. Its signatories were Kpawuru Sandy (Sierra Leone Red Cross Society), Peter G. Delaney (LFR International), Alfred Harun Thullah (ARCT), Patrick E. Turay (Holy Spirit Hospital), and Shaza Dous (University of Makeni). The establishment of the FRCSL was seen as timely given the 72nd World Health Assembly's previous declaration that emergency care systems were essential to universal health coverage in May of the same year.  Projects  With a mission of training first responders to treat casualties of accidents across the country and developing ambulatory emergency medical services across Sierra Leone, the Coalition began training first responders in the Northern Province of Sierra Leone, in Makeni, in June 2019. Coalition members trained more than 1,000 community members over a two-month period and equipped each responder with basic trauma management skills and materials. Between July and December 2019, 4,529 lay first responders were trained in total in Makeni and surrounding areas in Bombali District. Knowledge improvement pre-/post-course for participants taking pre- and post-tests was 34.8% vs 78.3%, (p<0.0001), while median participant knowledge retention at 6 months, indicated by a test score remained high at 60.9%. By 9 months, median score had dropped to 43.5%. Comparatively, local instructor-led courses demonstrated median knowledge improvement pre- vs. post-course was 30.4 percentage points (21.7% vs 52.2%, p<0.0001). Lay first responders trained by the FRCSL went on to treat 1,850 patients in the following six months, and used their skills in bleeding control most often in 61.2% of encounters. The most common patient encountered were young adult males (36.8%), while 48.7% of injury encounters were due to motorcycle accidents.

He is currently employed as the creative director at SB Nation. Bois is known for his speculative fiction works on sports, such as 17776 and \\"The Tim Tebow CFL Chronicles,\\" as well as his documentary video series including \\"Pretty Good\\", \\"Chart Party\\", and \\"Dorktown\\".  Career  Jon Bois was born on September 24, 1982 and is originally from Louisville, Kentucky. Bois started as an editor at SB Nation in 2009. From 2013 to 2015, Bois published \\"Breaking Madden,\\" a series of articles in which he created unusual football scenarios in the Madden NFL video games. In August 2014, he published \\"The Tim Tebow CFL Chronicles,\\" a sports story based on the fictional premise that NFL quarterback Tim Tebow had instead played his career in the Canadian Football League. In May 2015, Bois published the first episode of a documentary video series called \\"Pretty Good.\\" The series told true stories of unusual events, often related to sports, such as the career path of baseball player Lonnie Smith, professional poker, and the infamous 1904 Olympic marathon, but also including a variety of other topics such as the Lawnchair Larry flight and the TV series 24. the series has thirteen episodes, the last of which was published in September 2017. In 2016, Bois began another documentary video series called \\"Chart Party,\\" in which he used statistical analysis to explore and understand sports stories. Of particular note, Bois published an episode in December 2016 called \\"Every NFL Score Ever,\\" in which he discussed how football's scoring system makes some final game scores very unlikely, and coined the term \\"scorigami\\" to describe the act of achieving a never-before- seen final result. The video led one viewer to create a website to track new scorigami instances, and the term has seen usage in other sports publications. In July 2017, Bois published a serialized multimedia narrative called 17776, a work of speculative fiction describing unusual forms of football played in the distant future. According to Bois, the story garnered four million pageviews from 700,000 unique visitors in two weeks. The series won a National Magazine Award for Digital Innovation from the American Society of Magazine Editors. Bois began a sequel to 17776, entitled \\"20020\\", in September 2020. A chapter of Upon Further Review, a collection of sports what-if scenarios compiled by editor Mike Pesca published in 2018, was written by Bois, with his scenario being \\"What If Basketball Rims Were Smaller Than Basketballs?\\"What if Nixon had excelled in college football? What if Ali hadn‚Äôt been banished? In April 2018, Bois and fellow SB Nation personality Alex Rubenstein began the series \\"Dorktown\\", which followed a similar format and style as his prior series \\"Pretty Good\\", showcasing unusual events, statistics, and personalities from sports history. In 2020, Bois and Rubenstein released a 6-part special mini- series of Dorktown chronicling the history of the Seattle Mariners baseball franchise. In 2018, Bois collaborated with Felix Biederman of Chapo Trap House on the five-part documentary \\"Fighting In the Age of Loneliness\\", presented in style influenced by British documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis, which focuses on the development of Mixed Martial arts from the early development of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Vale Tudo in the development of more complex fighting styles. It focuses on the development of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) as a mainstream sport, including Pride Fighting Championship and the development of Ultimate Fighting Championships, and their parallels to the 21st century neoliberal socio-political landscape of financial collapse and inequality.

At the 1689 English general election, he was returned as Tory Member of Parliament for Aldeburgh on the interest of his brother Henry. Also in 1689, he was appointed Commissioner for assessment, for Middlesex, Suffolk and Aldeburgh to 1690, and Deputy Lieutenant for Tower Hamlets at least to 1702. He was not active in the Convention Parliament, but served on six committees including one to consider the management of the East India trade, one for the bill for restoring corporations, and one on a petition from the Royal Africa Company.

He was one of the best two-year-olds in Europe in 2018 when he was unbeaten in three races including the Superlative Stakes and the National Stakes. Injuries prevented him from running as a three-year-old in 2019 and he suffered a fatal injury when being trained for his reappearance in 2020. Background Quorto was a bay colt with a white star bred by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation. He was sent into training with Charlie Appleby at Godolphin's British base in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was sired by Dubawi a top-class son of Dubai Millennium, whose wins included the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois. At stud, Dubawi has been a highly-successful breeding stallion, siring major winners such as Monterosso, Al Kazeem, Makfi, Lucky Nine and Night of Thunder. Quorto's dam Volume was a high-class performer who won the Fillies' Trial Stakes and finished third in both the Epsom Oaks and the Irish Oaks. At the end of her racing career she was auctioned at Tattersalls in December 2014 and bought for 700,000 guineas by John Ferguson Bloodstock on behalf of Godolphin. She was a granddaughter of the outstanding staying mare Victoire Bleue who won the Prix du Cadran and Prix Gladiateur. Victoire Bleue was in turn a granddaughter of Virunga who ran third to Allez France and Dahlia in the Prix de Diane and was a half-sister to Vitiges. Racing career =2018: two-year-old season= On his track debut, Quorto started at odds of 9/4 for a minor race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 22 June. Ridden by James Doyle he took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by two and three quarter lengths from the John Gosden- trained filly Handmaiden. William Buick took the ride when the colt was stepped up in class for the Group 2 Superlative Stakes over seven furlongs the same course and three weeks later and started the 5/4 favourite. After racing in second place behind the Irish challenger Cape of Good Hope for most of the way he went to the front a furlong out and went clear of his six opponents to win \\"very readily\\" by three and three quarter lengths. After the race Charlie Appleby commented \\"We were confident coming here today that he had come forward and that the step up in trip was going to suit. He has shown some gears there. William got off and said he has a great racing mind. He is an exciting horse, for sure\\". In September, Quorto was sent to Ireland to contest the Group 1 National Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh in which he was again partnered by Buick. He was made the 11/8 favourite ahead of Anthony Van Dyck in a seven-runner field which also included Land Force (Richmond Stakes) and Christmas (Caravaggio Stakes). He raced in third place behind Christmas and Anthony Van Dyck before taking the lead a furlong out and kept on well to win by one and a quarter lengths. He appeared to lean into the runner-up Anthony Van Dyck in the closing stages but after a stewards' inquiry the result was allowed to stand. Appleby said \\"He's a typical Dubawi. From the Superlative Stakes to here, he needed all of that time and he had a spell where he went a bit quiet on us, but that's typical of a Dubawi... we were all confident coming into today\\". In the official ratings for Irish-raced juveniles for 2018 Quorto was given a mark of 121, making him the best two- year-old of the year. He was rated the second best two-year-old in Europe behind Too Darn Hot Death Quorto missed the whole of the 2019 season owing to injury but was expected to return to the track as a four-year-old in 2020.

Description Allophylus natalensis is a small evergreen tree with a single stem up to tall, or it may develop as a bush with multiple, shorter stems. The bark is greyish-brown and may have a smooth texture or develop wrinkles. The smaller branches are greyish-white and downy. The leaves are borne on long petioles and are trifoliate, with three, almost stalkless, elliptical leaflets some long by wide. The leaflets are leathery and stiff, glossy green above, and pale green below, with shallowly toothed margins. The small fragrant flowers grow in spike-like racemes in the axils of the leaves, and are followed by abundant red, globular berries, in diameter. Flowering takes place in autumn between March and May and the berries ripen in late winter, between June and August. Distribution and habitat This tree is native to the Eastern Cape Province and KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. Its natural habitat is coastal dune forest and scrub, where it often grows in association with Mimusops caffra, Apodytes dimidiata and Canthium obovatum. Ecology Charaxes varanes vologeses The flowers are pollinated by butterflies and the berries are appreciated by both birds, which disperse the seeds, and humans.

The film intersperses two separate narratives: one following Vera, a fictional housewife living in Czechoslovakia, and another following Eva, an Olympic gymnast played by real-life Olympic gold medalist Eva Bos√°kov√°. Chytilov√°'s first feature-length film, it is regarded as one of the breakout films of the Czech New Wave, as well as an early example of women's cinema in the Eastern Bloc. While not as well known as some of Chytilov√°'s other films such as Daisies and Fruit of Paradise, it won the main prize at the 1963 Mannheim Film Festival, and has been praised by both contemporary critics and 21st century retrospectives, in addition to receiving a fair amount of attention in academic film literature.  Background  Released in 1963, Something Different was one of the first films of the Czech New Wave, and Chytilov√°'s first feature-length film. Chytilov√° was one of the only women filmmakers who participated in the Czech New Wave, and Something Different, like many other of the entries in her filmography, focuses on women's lives and challenges in Czechoslovakia.  Style and synopsis  Something Different merges documentary-style footage of Eva, a Czechoslovakian gymnast played by real- life Olympic gold-medalist Eva Bos√°kov√°, as she endures incessant training in preparation for a competition. These scenes are juxtaposed against a narrative following the fictional housewife Vera, who is discontented and overwhelmed by housework as she struggles to take care of her misbehaving son and her inattentive husband, eventually resorting to a similarly unsatisfying affair. The only scene in which the two women's lives intersect is at a game of cards at the beginning of the film‚Äì‚Äìotherwise, the two narratives are tied together only implicitly and thematically. After many scenes of Eva enduring grueling and humiliating training sessions, the film includes scenes of her actually performing her routine at a competition, and a final shot of her working as a gymnastics instructor for a younger woman. Meanwhile, Vera's marriage almost collapses as her husband reveals that he saw Vera with another man and tells her that they should divorce, although a final scene shows her together with family, if still less than happy.  Analysis  Something Different has been described as a cinematic breakthrough alongside Black Peter and The Cry, discarding the morality tales of earlier socialist cinema and replacing them with frank depictions of everyday life, in addition to breaking with other traditional conventions of film form. In an overview of Chytilov√°'s early career, Ji≈ô√≠ Ceslar, professor of film at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague, describes the film as a meditation on the meaning of life, expressed through Eva and Vera's lines which are on one hand trivial everyday phrases and on the other hand appear to have metaphorical importance as commentary on life's struggles; these statements also carry a theme set in the film's title, as they are always \\"about something different\\". While the film invites the viewer to draw connections between Vera and Eva's lives through their narrative juxtaposition, scholars have also noted the stark difference in the nature of Eva and Vera's problems: where Eva is constrained by an extremely rigid regime of exercise, Vera is vexed by a lack of direction.McEneaney, Kathleen (2013) For Country, For Women: Women Directors in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and RomaniaCinesthesia: Vol. 2 : Iss. 1. Something Different is also contrasted against Chytilov√°'s following two films, 1965's Pearls of the Deep and 1966's Daisies. In particular, the three films display a progression in Chytilov√°'s use of structure, with Pearls of the Deep as a stepping stone between the tightly structured Something Different and the anarchic Daisies. Similarly, Something Different is an example of Chytilov√°'s use of the style of cinema verite in her early career, contrasted against more allegorical works such as Daisies and Fruit of Paradise.  Reception  A contemporary review in Le Monde praised Chytilov√°'s humor and virtuoso technique. The film won the main prize at the Mannheim Film Festival in 1963. The film has also received renewed attention from Anglophone critics in the 21st century. A review by The Arts Desk of a DVD release of the film in 2016 praised the film's ability to avoid pretentiousness, thanks to the work of the Chytilov√°, Cur√≠k, Slitr, and H√°jek. A review in The New Yorker called it \\"radically and thrillingly different from more or less any film that was being made at the time\\", praising its camerawork and subject matter. A review in Hyperallergic described the film as \\"subtle and poignant\\".

He performed in his own plays for radio. Childhood and education William Ingram, widely known as Bill Ingram except on stage and on the page, was born in Resolven, Glamorgan, Wales in 1930, to Louisa May (n√©e Snook) and William J. Ingram. Six years later the family moved to Ogmore Vale, where he attended Ogmore Grammar School. Early career Singled out early as one of two 'tip-top' Welsh actors - with Mervyn Johns - for his role as the Dutch student Karl in the 1955 'new British colour film', The Blue Peter, in a review in the Western Mail the two actors were described as 'among the best things in the film'Aberdovey in Colour, Review of The Blue Peter , Western Mail , Wednesday 23 November 1955]...'Young Mr Ingram rapidly established himself as the best of our young performers, bringing an altogether delightful charm to his many scenes.' It was not his only admired performance in 1955. Appearing on stage in the Jubilee production of Peter Pan at Birmingham‚Äôs Alexandra Theatre, The Birmingham Daily Post described him as a 'notable Slightly'[The Jubilee Peter Pan, Birmingham Daily Post, Tuesday, 15 March 1955], fifty years after the character‚Äôs first appearance on stage. The production, and Ingram, would transfer to London‚Äôs Scala Theatre that Christmas. The following year would see Ingram join the 1956 company at Regent‚Äôs Park Open Air Theatre in London where he took a role that would prove key to his development as a writer. Feste is the clown or fool in Shakespeare‚Äôs comedy Twelfth Night. He brings the play to an end with the famous song The rain it raineth every day - With hey, ho, the wind and the rain. It would give him the inspiration for his first stage play. In the meantime, he took on the title role of Alfred Wendham in Rediffusion‚Äôs television production of E. F. Benson‚Äôs The Hanging of Alfred WendhamThe Hanging of Alfred Wendham, 1957, IMDb , with the actor Patrick McGoohan in the supporting cast. Ingram would appear in a supporting role in McGoohan‚Äôs long- running series Danger Man nine years laterDanger Man, The Hunting Party, 1966, IMDb. Ingram would continue to work as an actor, but a major change was signalled when his first play, The Rain it Raineth, was presented at the Hampstead Theatre Club in London, in 1959. An outlying challenge to London‚Äôs established theatres at the time, it was a venue for new voices. Ingram‚Äôs play was reviewed by the major critics and directed by the theatre‚Äôs founder, James Roose-Evans. From the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, the actor Trader Faulkner was cast as the struggling actor in the lead role. In an era of Angry young men, one article was headlined Not Angry. The Stage review was headlined,Portrait of a Frustrated Actor[Portrait of a Frustrated Actor, The Stage, Thursday, 5 November 1959]. One of the eminent critics of the day, J.C. Trewin, wrote: 'In effect, William Ingram‚Äôs first play is a play of hope, though I doubt very much if it would encourage anybody to be an actor. But it does offer hope for the dramatist‚Äôs future. He writes with a fluency that will be valuable when he softens his all too realistic idiom and becomes selective[The Rain It Raineth, Birmingham Daily Post- Monday, 2 November 1959].' Critical reservations of a 'too realistic idiom' aside, Ingram had found his metier. During the 1960s, while continuing to work in television and the theatre, he also found his medium. Radio would offer him room to write stories, dramas, comedies, horror and adoptions, beginning in 1966 and continuing into the 2000s. Dramatic works and performances Ingram was a writer for the 1980s British television series, The District Nurse. He also played the ghost of Dylan Thomas in the televised version of A Solitary MisterA Solitary Mister, 1983, BBC Cymru Wales television, British Film Institute.[1]. In the six-part TV series Target Luna (1960), Ingram played the part of Flt. Lt. Williams. He appeared in a number of ITV television plays and he wrote 12 episodes for in the BBC television series The District Nurse, produced by BBC Wales and shown on BBC One. He also played the part of Band Chairman in an episode. It was at BBC Radio drama that Ingram found his home, performing, reading and writing for credits in the hundred, including roles in many of the plays and dramatisations that he had written.

Background Anthony George Baker was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and was the son of German immigrants, Dr Jacob Baker and Mary Catherine Platt. He graduated from the Western University of Pennsylvania with degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in 1869. Thereafter he entered the Western Theological Seminary in Allegheny, Pennsylvania from where he graduated in 1873 with a Bachelor of Divinity and was ordained a minister of the Presbyterian Church. He was assigned in Bardolph, Illinois and later to the only Presbyterian church in Atlantic City, New Jersey. During his stay in Atlantic City, Baker inclined increasingly towards Episcopalianism and converted to the Episcopalian church, becoming a Deacon and then, in 1879, an ordained priest. He worked both as an assistant rector and rector of several churches in Pennsylvania, including, as assistant to the rectors of St. George's Church, Philadelphia and the Church of The Epiphany. He also founded St. Simeon's Church in Philadelphia. Alongside his work as a clergyman, Baker studied at the Jefferson Medical College and graduated as a medical doctor in 1887 specialising in pediatrics and practicing both standard and homeopathic medicine. He soon retired abruptly from the ministry to practice medicine, serving in the Pennsylvania Naval Reserves and as a physician at the Chinese Medical Dispensary of Philadelphia where he would become the chief physician. Baker became well known for his translation of The Phonendoscope and its Practical Application (1898) by which the use of the modern stethoscope of the time became more widely acknowledged. His interest in history, languages and eastern religions led him to study various European languages as well as Arabic and Chinese, the cultures and religions of whose native speakers Baker published and presented historical papers on. He also presented papers before the Cooper Literary Institute in Philadelphia and had served for some time as its President.Who's Who in Pennsylvania, 2nd Edition, (1908), p.32 Conversion to Islam George Baker's earliest known connection with American Muslim converts was in August 1893 when Alexander Russell Webb, another early American convert to Islam, published a section of a work by Baker concerning the relationship between medieval Christians and Muslims in Jerusalem in his newspaper the Moslem World. According to author Patrick D. Bowen, Baker was in contact with Webb and may have ran his Oriental Publishing Company from a Philadelphia post office in 1892 and 1894. He was known for his lectures on Islam in Philadelphia and may also have been secretly associated with a group of about twenty Muslim converts in the city during this period. Baker's Muslim contacts outside the United States included the English convert Abdullah Quilliam and in January 1896 he explicitly identified as a Muslim in a letter to Quilliam's newspaper The Crescent. Baker also had connections with the Ahmadiyya movement in India through the movement's English-language journal, The Review of Religions, with which Webb had also corresponded. His contact with the movement began in 1904 and was the result of his writings having found their way to India and coming to the attention of Mufti Muhammad Sadiq, a disciple of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Baker was among a number of European and American figures with whom Sadiq had established contact during Ghulam Ahmad's lifetime and he was mentioned in the fifth volume of Ghulam Ahmad's Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya (1905; The Muhammadan Proofs). In his first reply to Sadiq's letter dated October 28, 1904, Baker affirmed the Islamic creed, claimed to be a practicing Muslim and endorsed Ghulam Ahmad's work. in subsequent correspondences, he was more direct in his affirmation of Ghulam Ahmad's prophetic role and in his expressions of allegiance to the Ahmadiyya movement and‚Äîalthough he does not appear to have formally initiated into the movement‚Äîis therefore counted within it as one of the earliest American Ahmadis. He remained in contact with the movement until his death in 1918 and upon his arrival as a missionary to the United States in 1920, Sadiq posthumously included Baker's name in a list of American converts to Islam.

It is now in the Art Institute of Chicago, to which it was left in 1925 by James Deering, heir to the Deering Harvester Company (International Harvester).. According to Th√©ophile Thor√©- Burger, the painting was based on Anthony van Dyck's Christ Crowned with Thorns (destroyed in Berlin in 1945, though a version of it survives in the Princeton University Art Museum). Other authors argue it draws on Titian's 1542‚Äì43 work of the same title, now in the Louvre. In 1959 Michel Leiris noted its similarities to an engraving by Schelte Adams Bolswert, whilst Theodore Reff saw it as influenced by Ecce homo (Madrid, Prado Museum) or Christ Mocked by the Soldiers, both by Van Dyck. Julius Meier-Graefe also noted the influence of Diego Vel√°zquez on the work and Ann Coffin Hanson that of Hendrick ter Brugghen. image:Anthony van Dyck - Ecce Homo.jpgAnthony van Dyck, Ecce homo (c. 1625‚Äì1626), Birmingham, Barber Institute of Fine Arts image:The Mocking of Christ (van Dyck).jpgAnthony van Dyck, Christ Crowned with Thorns (c. 1628‚Äì1630), Princeton University Art Museum This work and his The Dead Christ with Angels (1864) were adjudged violent and insufficiently academic by art critics and the public.

Manet's usual critics such as Bertall, Cham, Andr√© Gill, Draner, Stop and Albert Robida also attacked the work in Le Charivari, the Journal amusant , Le Monde pour rire, L'√âclipse (replaced by the La Lune), Le Tintamarre, La Vie parisienne and several other publications. In his 1872 inventory of his works, Manet valued the work at 15000 francs. It was put on sale in 1883 but was withdrawn from the sale before finally being bought from L√©on Leehoff by the art dealers Boussod and Valadon in 1893. According to Tabarant, it was Durand- Ruel who bought it from Manet's widow, but Durand-Ruel's records show he bought the work jointly with Jean-Baptiste Faure in 1894, Faure exhibited it in New York and finally Durand-Ruel sold it for 22,000 francs to James Deering.

McDowell, an expert on the Near East, was a professor of Balkan history at the University of Michigan. During World War II he was an OSS desk officer in Cairo and between August and November 1944 a member of an American mission Ranger, to the Chetniks, where he participated in negotiations with Germans to surrender their troops to Chetniks and Americans, and in Operation Halyard, to organize transport of the Allied pilots rescued by Chetniks. In some works he has been described as a man of \\"violently pro-Chetnik prejudices\\".  Early life  McDowell was a professor of Balkan history at the University of Michigan.: \\"..... Robert H. McDowell, a former professor of Balkan history at the University of Michigan, arrived at Chetnik headquarters.\\" McDowell was also an expert on the Near East.  During the World War II  = Arrival to Mihailoviƒá's Chetniks = The American president Theodore Roosevelt personally directed all important steps of the operations of the Office of Strategic Services related to Mihailoviƒá's Chetniks because they were an instrument of US policy to avoid Partisan dominated Yugoslavia.:\\"Washington's pursuit of contact with Mihailovic ....U.S. policy was not accidental, however, and while doubtless driven in part by General Donovan's desire to make the OSS an indispensable instrument of U.S. policy, Roosevelt himself sanctioned every critical step in the process. This policy is therefore best understood as an effort to utilize whatever levers might be available to fashion a policy capable of avoiding a Partisan-dominated Yugoslavia.\\" McDowell, who had been an OSS desk officer in Cairo,: \\"...McDowell, an OSS desk officer from Cairo....\\" arrived in the German-occupied territory of Serbia with six members of the \\"Ranger\\" team in late August 1944 to organize transport of the Allied pilots rescued by Chetniks during Operation Halyard.: \\"Officially McDowell was rescuing fliers, but unofficially he was there to continue OSS intelligence operations with the Chetniks. McDowell surveyed Chetnik and Axis forces and witnessed firsthand the Partisans' systematic efforts to destroy the Chetniks\\" On 22 August 1944, Mihailovic was informed by members of his headquarters that George Musulin informed them about McDowell's direct access to Roosevelt. At that time the Chetniks had already ordered a general mobilization aimed against Axis forces, so McDowell personally witnessed positioning of mobilized Chetnik troops to follow this aim and their resistance to German and Bulgarian forces to the final limits of people and equipment, capturing substantial number of prisoners and quantity of ammunition. Mihailovic informed McDowell that he had mobilized about 100,000 men with arms and 500,000 men without arms by 1 September 1944. = Negotiations for the surrender of German forces in Yugoslavia = Based on the instructions of the United States High Command, McDowell organized surrender conferences with representatives of German forces. In his later statements, approved by the War and State Departments, McDowell emphasized that Mihailovic did not attend the conferences about the surrender of German forces in Yugoslavia in August 1944. In September 1944, the German command at Belgrade contacted McDowell and held two meetings with him at Mihailoviƒá's headquarters, declaring that German forces in Yugoslavia were willing to surrender to the Americans and Chetniks but not to communist forces of the Soviet Union and Josip Broz Tito's Partisans. McDowell reported this to Allied headquarters which immediately ordered him to break off his contacts with the Germans.: \\" These discussions were duly reported to Allied headquarters, which quickly ordered that the contact with the Germans be broken off.\\" When the Partisans were informed that McDowell was negotiating the surrender of German troops in Yugoslavia they became infuriated.:\\"When the Partisans learned of the McDowell negotiations, they were in-furiated ///\\" In September, the Partisans began a major offensive against the Chetniks preventing McDowell's team from using an already prepared landing site for the evacuation of American airmen.: \\"September also marked the beginning of a major Partisan offensive against the Cetniks. This forced the Air Crew Rescue Unit to locate a new landing site to evacuate airmen who continued to fall into the hands of Mihailoviƒá's hard-pressed followers. Tito's associates condemned McDowell, demanding his withdrawal because they believed that he was giving political prestige to the Chetniks who did not deserve it.:\\"When the Partisans learned of the McDowell negotiations, they were in-furiated ... Tito's aides condemned McDowell ...They \\"continued to demand McDowell's withdrawal on the ground that he was giving the Chetniks politi-cal prestige they didn't deserve?\\" Churchill again personally intervened through Roosevelt, and McDowell was ordered to leave Mihailovic in September 1944.:\\" McDowell and his men had in fact been ordered to leave Serbia in September, again as a result of Churchill's personal intervention. \\" = Leaving Mihailoviƒá's headquarters = Despite his order to leave Chetnik headquarters, McDowell remained in Mihailovic's headquarters because American planes could not land on Chetnik controlled territory due to the weather conditions and increased armed conflict in the area. In October 1944, Tito personally engaged himself in connection with McDowell's negotiated surrender of German troops and warned Brigadier Fitzroy MacLean, the chief of the British mission to the Partisans, that the presence of McDowell and his team would certainly damage relations between the Partisans, Britain and the United States, claiming that McDowell had promised American support to Mihailovic.:\\"In October, Tito took up the issue person-ally with Brigadier MacLean. He warned that the McDowell team's presence \\"was certain to react unfavorably on Partisan relations with the United States and Great Britain.\\" Tito claimed McDowell was encouraging Mihailovic with promises of future American support.\\" Some consider it possible that the Partisans forged a \\"captured\\" leaflet and showed it to Huntington at Tito's headquarters to provoke the recall of McDowell.: \\"In view of short time between the arrival of McDowell and the \\"captured\\" leaflet shown to Huntington at Tito's headquarters, some thought it could have been written by the Partisans in order to provoke McDowell's recall\\" The British mission with Mihailoviƒá was recalled in December 1943. After McDowell left the Chetnik headquarters by plane on 23 November 1944 they remained without direct contact with the Allies during their retreat before the Partisan forces.: \\"–ù–∏—ò–µ –∏–º —Å–∞–æ–ø—à—Ç–∏–æ –¥–∞ —Å—É —á–µ—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü–∏ –∏–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏ –æ–¥ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ —Å–∞–≤–µ–∑–Ω–∏–∫–∞. ... –ü—Ä–µ –ø–æ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–∞ —Ü—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ö —á–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞ —Ç–∞–º–æ, –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Ç–∏ —Å–∞ —Å–∞–≤–µ–∑–Ω–∏—Ü–∏–º–∞ —Å—É –±–∏–ª–∏ –ø–æ—Ç–ø—É–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–µ–∫–∏–Ω—É—Ç–∏. –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏—á–∫–∏ –ø—É–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫ –∏ —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä–∑–∏—Ç–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ—Å–æ—Ä –ú–µ–∫–î–∞—É–µ–ª —ò–µ 23.11.1944. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ –æ–¥–ª–µ—Ç–µ–æ –∞–≤–∏–æ–Ω–æ–º.\\" Two members of the American mission (Lalic and Jibilian) actually remained with the Chetnik headquarters after McDowell left it, and after unremitting efforts to sever even this last tie between Chetniks and Allies, they were ordered to retreat through Partisan-controlled territory. The last member of McDowell's team left the Chetniks on 11 December 1944.  After World War II  In some works McDowell was described as a man of \\"violently pro-Chetnik prejudices\\".: \\"A man of ‚Äúviolently pro-ƒåetnik prejudices,‚Äù McDowell arrived at Mihailoviƒá's headquarters in September 1944, just as a renewed Partisan offensive against\\" In answer to congressional questions raised during a debate, about how much damage the Chetniks inflicted on the German war effort, McDowell claimed that all available evidence shows that German troops concentrated more on Chetniks rather than on Partisan-held territories because they held greater animosity and fear toward Mihailoviƒá than Tito. He also claimed that Chetniks had performed the most important sabotages against transport infrastructure of the Axis. Based on the official reports of other officers regarding the civil war in Yugoslavia and based on his own observations, McDowel concluded that \\"the principal concern of the Partisan leadership has been, not to destroy Germans, but Nationalists and Nationalism in Yugoslavia and the Balkans.\\"  Bibliography  After World War II, McDowell wrote a book titled The Key Role in Southeastern Europe during World War Two of the Serbs and Their Commander General Draza Mihailovich despite Their Abandonment by Churchill and Roosevelt. In 2015, this book was submitted to the court in Serbia as evidence during the process for rehabilitation of Mihailoviƒá.

Three were built but its performance, particularly its glide ratio, was not good enough for it to be produced for Polish clubs. Design and development The M-3 Pliszka was the first Polish all-metal glider. It was also the first design from a young team led by Zdzis≈Çaw ≈ªoka in the WSK factory at Mielek, hence the M in the designation. Before the glider had been completed the factory had been reorganized and had regained its pre-war name of PZL. Though the design was largely finished by early 1957, construction was delayed and the first flight was not made until 20 March 1959. The pilot was S. Makaruk. The Pliszka had a two-part mid-wing of trapezoidal plan, with most sweep on the trailing edge, mounted with 3.5¬∞ of dihedral. Each half-wing was built around a single spar with a diagonal drag strut near the root from spar to fuselage. Forward of the spar the wing was metal stress-skinned, forming a torsion-resistant D-box, with fabric covering aft. Slotted, divided, balanced ailerons filled about half the span, with spoilers mounted on the rear of the spar a little inboard of them. The M-3 Pliszka's metal skinned fuselage was built in two parts. The forward section, including the cockpit with its high-domed, two- piece transparency in front of the wing and the wing mounting, was a semi- monocoque, elliptical section, stressed skin structure. A short rearward conical extension joined it to a circular section, monocoque tail boom and a conventional tail, with a narrow, straight-tapered fin and cantilever tailplane, the latter mounted on top of the fuselage well forward of the rudder hinge. The elevators were also narrow and straight-tapered. The control surfaces of the M-3 were entirely metal-covered. The Pliszka landed on a rubber cord sprung monowheel positioned aft of the spar, a short nose skid and a small, rubber sprung tail bumper. The monowheel had a brake interconnected with the spoilers. Two M-3 flight prototypes, together with a third airframe for static stress testing, were built. The first flight prototype flew on 20 March 1958. Its flight tests were encouraging, with performance figures better than predicted, so a second prototype with minor improvements was built. Its wing tips were altered and the spoilers limited to opening above the wing, There were also cockpit changes, partly to improve the pilot's view. It first flew on 5 March 1960. The last Pliszka, designated M-3A, was a version strengthened for aerobatics. Structural changes included metal skinning over all the first of each wing root and reinforcement of the rear fuselage. Control surfaces were also modified: the ailerons gained a third mounting point and the structure and profile of the rudder were altered, giving it a more pointed tip and a rounded underside. The rudder was partly fabric- covered, the elevators wholly so. The aerodynamic balances of the tail surfaces was increased and the ailerons mass-balanced. Operational history The first prototype was exhibited at shows in Pozna≈Ñ and Warsaw in 1960, and at ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in 1961. That year the Pliszka 60 was certified and in 1963 it joined the PZL factory's aeroclub at Mielek.

Early life and education  Mitchell studied physics at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. She remained there for her doctoral studies, where she explored the use of radio tomography to study the Earth's ionosphere. She was awarded the Royal Astronomical Society Keith Runcorn Prize (then Blackwell Prize) and University of Wales Granville Beynon prize for her dissertation.  Research and career  Mitchell was awarded an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Challenging Engineering fellowship to develop algorithms for four-dimensional tomography, known MIDAS, Multi-Instrument Data Analysis Systems. She joined the University of Bath in 1999. She has used her computational algorithms in medical physics, working with the Christie Hospital and Royal United Hospital Bath to image for human movement, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. She led a fieldwork mission with the British Antarctic Survey to Antarctica, where she set up equipment at Rothera, Halley and in the Shackleton Mountains. She held a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award from 2009-2014. She is a Professor of Radio Science at the University of Bath, where she serves as Academic Director of the University of Bath Doctoral College. Mitchell developed a new Earth observation technique that uses ground-based and satellite data to image the ionosphere, providing information on how space weather may impact Global Positioning Systems (GPS). The technique has provided the first view of the ionosphere in response to space weather. Mitchell's research allows us to understand the origins of space weather as well as identifying how to better forecast. A solar storm in North America, one example of space weather, could result in a $2.6 trillion hit to the economy. She showed that magnetospheric electric fields cause large plasma enhancements and uplifts. The Government of the United Kingdom have invested several million to develop the ionosphere algorithms in MIDAS for space weather forecasts. Her algorithms have also contributed to GPS simulations developed by Spirent. In 2015 she was asked by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory to act as a UK government special adviser for the Emergencies sub group to examine infrastructure resilience to solar storms.

It is an oil painting on canvas measuring 185.1 x 128.6 cm, and is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It and Boy Carrying a Sword were the first of Manet's works to enter a gallery collection. It was first exhibited in the May 1867 exhibition of his works on the Avenue de l'Alma (now the Avenue George-V) in Paris as catalogue number 15, with the title Jeune dame en 1866.Metropolitan Museum of Art, Exhibition History. At the 1868 Paris Salon, the work's realism and inclusion of a parakeet was reminiscent of Gustave Courbet's 1866 Woman with a Parrot (Metropolitan Museum of Art), a nude which had caused a scandal at that year's Salon. Manet's work was similarly criticised and the public came to nickname it Lady with a Parakeet, although it had been exhibited as Lady in Pink, then as A Young Lady or Young Lady in 1866. Provenance Manet sold it to the art dealer Durand-Ruel in January 1872 for 1500 francs. He in turn sold it on to the textile magnate, art collector and friend of Claude Monet Ernest Hosched√© five years later for 2,000 or 2,500 francs. Hosched√© sold it at the h√¥tel Drouot on 6 June 1878 for 700 francs to Henri Hecht. It then returned to Durand-Ruel, who sold it to J. Alden Weir on behalf of Erwin Davis in 1881. Davis in turn sold it as Feeding the Parrot through the dealer John Ortgies in a sale on 19 and 20 March 1889 in New YorkJohn Ortgies (1836‚Äì1908). and bought it back for 1350 dollars.

It is about nine miles from central London, in the fertile Lea Valley on the western edge of Epping Forest. In the 19th century it formed the grounds of a large Elizabethan-style Victorian mansion, seat of Richard Hodgson, lord of Chingford St. Pauls. The mansion became derelict after bomb damage in 1944 and was demolished in 1951. Part of the site is now a nature reserve, a special school has been built on another part, and a large part of the site is being used by OrganicLea, a workers' cooperative growing and selling food and providing horticultural training. History The Hawkwood estate is named after the area of Epping Forest called \\"Hawk Wood\\" on the 1896 Ordnance Survey map whose name derives from \\"Chyngeforde(s)halke\\" (1323), later \\"Chyngford Hauke\\" (1501), meaning remote corner of Chingford, since it is situated on the north-western parish boundary. In 1498, William Jacson of Chingford Halke owned land around Hawkwood, and was a member of the Swainmote Court. Hawkwood was part of the Chingford St. Pauls Manor estate, so called because it had been held by the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's Cathedral for 500 years; in 1544, Henry VIII acquired the manors of Chingford Earls and Chingford St. Paul's with the intention of expanding the deer park he had created in Chingford between 1540 and 1543. However, Henry died in 1547 and the deer park was discontinued in 1553. In 1832, Rev. T. Snell, Lord of the manor of Chingford St. Pauls lived in Hawkwood, but the location of his house is not known. He died in 1843 and the Manor estate was put up for sale. =Richard Hodgson= Richard Hodgson (1804‚Äì1872) bought Hawkwood in 1844, together with the manorial rights, part of Chingford Plain and some land at Chingford Green, for ¬£2900. Hodgson had retired from being the leading partner in the publishing company Hodgson & Graves in 1841 to work on scientific pursuits, including daguerrotypy, microscopy and astronomy. During the late 1840s, he established the Hawkwood estate, constructing the Manor house to a design by Vulliamy, as well as the bailiff's cottage, stables, coach house and other outbuildings. The house was built in red brick with stone dressings and had a Gothic entrance hall, drawing room, dining room, library opening into a handsome conservatory, domestic offices, and billiard room. There were eight bedrooms and dressing rooms as well as day and night nurseries. The basement stored coal, wines and beer. In separate buildings there was a coach house and brick-built stables for four horses, as well as a cow house and piggeries. The elevated site afforded fine views over the valley and a long carriage drive led to the road. A ring of bricks in the ground near the site of the house indicates that the water supply was initially from a well. The bailiff's cottage, now known as Hawkwood Lodge, had a sitting room, kitchen, scullery, wash-house and four bedrooms as well as two acres of pasture. The cottage survives and now has Listed Building status; the London Borough of Waltham Forest converted it into a Field Study Centre in 1981. In 1848 Hodgson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and built an observatory in Claybury, Essex in 1852. He later moved the 6-inch refractor to an observatory he built in the grounds of Hawkwood, a short distance west of the house. Hodgson moved with his family to Hawkwood during the 1860s. At the time of the 1861 census, they lived in Grove End House, St. John's Wood, London: Hodgson, his wife Jane (n√©e Cooke), son Richard (1830‚Äì1880) who was a civil engineer, daughter Margaret Anne (1840‚Äì1912) and three servants. However, the 1871 census shows Hodgson and his wife and daughter as resident in Hawkwood House, together with four servants. Hodgson died on 4 May 1872 and the estate, described in probate records as \\"Effects under ¬£30,000\\", passed to his widow Jane, who died in 1880. Jane's will left her estate to her daughter Margaret but made provision for her grandchildren through the sale of land around the house, Hodgson's scientific equipment and the farm. The house and estate were advertised for sale in May 1880, and a number of items were sold at auction in 1883, including a drawing room suite upholstered in amber silk, a carved oak dining room suite covered in blue Morocco leather, a Hopkinson cottage piano, a full- sized billiard table by Burroughes & Watts and many other high quality items. =Sidney Cooper= Sidney Cooper (1841‚Äì1913), a retired tea merchant, bought the house, lodge and piggeries in 1886 for ¬£6250. The Great Eastern Railway rail service between Chingford and central London had opened in 1873, and the current railway station, only about a mile from Hawkwood, had opened in 1878. Cooper was a member of the Essex Field Club and a well-known entomologist. At the 1891 census, he was 50 years old and lived \\"on his own means\\" at Hawkwood with his wife Emily (1839‚Äì1924), two sons Sidney H. and Harold who were stockbrokers' clerks, and three daughters Alice, Edith and Helen. They had a lady's maid, a housemaid, a parlour maid and a cook. Hawkwood Lodge was occupied by the coachman George Cuff with his wife and daughter. Cooper's elder son Sidney H. Cooper died at Hawkwood at the age of 21 from tetanus on 1 May 1891; this followed a knee injury on 18th April when he came off his bicycle while riding down nearby King's Head Hill. In 1898, Cooper purchased part of a nearby farm, an area that later became a housing estate in the 1930s. Sidney Cooper died in Calais on 5 March 1913, leaving an estate valued over ¬£125,783. Hawkwood remained in the family until it was advertised for sale with vacant possession in October 1921 and was sold at auction for ¬£3500 to Adolphus Herman Louis of Beaulieu. In 1924, when Cooper's widow Emily died, Hawkwood was sold to G. C. Nokes of Forest Road, Walthamstow for ¬£3,600. =Public ownership= George Nokes and his wife Constance were the last private owners of Hawkwood. George Nokes died in 1933, and in 1937 Mrs. Nokes transferred the outlying farms to the Conservators of Epping Forest and the main Hawkwood estate was sold to Chingford Urban District Council for ¬£7250 with a covenant for it to be preserved as an open space and as a memorial to King George V. Chingford County High School In 1938, Chingford County High School, a coeducational grammar school, was founded. The school used Hawkwood House as temporary premises for the first year. The first intake of 22 boys and 26 girls from the surrounding area started on 15 September, though the official opening was not until 2 November. The school magazine relates how even subjects such as chemistry were taught in the living room of the house. Then in 1939 at the start of the second world war, the school was evacuated, first to Hockley in Essex, then to Coleford in the west of England where they were able to share a science laboratory with another school. The school returned in 1941 to new buildings in Nevin Drive, Chingford. Wartime damage and demolition During World War II the house was damaged during a period when it was requisitioned by the Army. In 1943, Chingford Urban District Council arranged for the house to be connected to mains water and undertook some maintenance of the grounds. However, the house suffered considerable damage when a German V-1 flying bomb, coming from the north east, crashed into Hawkwood at 11:23 p.m. on 21 October 1944. There were no casualties as the house was unoccupied at the time. Property in nearby residential roads Hawkswood Crescent and Epping Glade was also damaged by the blast. A request was made in 1945 by Chingford Townswomen's Guild and Women's Association that the house should be converted to a maternity hospital. But then in 1949, Hawkwood was sold to Essex County Council for use as a school, an intention that never came into effect. The house remained vandalised, unoccupied, derelict and unsafe until the Council arranged for its demolition by Ernest Knifton Ltd in 1951 for ¬£375. The site remained undeveloped in accordance with Mrs. Nokes's covenant. Then in 1965 Chingford became part of the London Borough of Waltham Forest. Hawkswood School for the deaf During the 1960s, an area in the northern part of the estate next to Yardley Lane was fenced off and a purpose-built special school for deaf children was constructed on the site. The William Morris School for the deaf, founded in Walthamstow in 1900, relocated in September 1969 to the new school, and the school went on to provide specialist education for deaf children from west Essex, Redbridge and Waltham Forest for over thirty years. In September 2004 the school became Hawkswood Primary PRU (Pupil Referral Unit), catering for up to 44 children in the 4‚Äì11 age group. Their focus is for pupils in Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4 at the delicate and fragile end of the mental health spectrum, including those with depression, psychosis, anorexia and self-harm. The Ofsted inspection 2015 rated the school as \\"Outstanding\\" in all respects. Hawkwood Pond and nature reserve Near the western edge of the estate, an ornamental garden had been constructed around a pond in the grounds of the house. This subsequently became publicly accessible under the 1937 covenant, and remained so until 1979, when Waltham Forest Council fenced it off. Widespread objections ensued from many quarters: members of the Friends of Epping Forest, conservators, Waltham Forest Civic Society, the Drysdale & District Residents Association, Members of Parliament, and Lord Murray of Epping Forest. Eventually the 'Open Space' status of Hawkwood was confirmed, with reference to the minutes of the 1937 council meeting which were held in the Vestry House Museum, and public access was restored. Authorisation was given to create a voluntary organisation called \\"The Friends of Hawkwood Nature Reserve\\" as caretakers of the pond and surrounding area. Hawkwood Plant Nursery Waltham Forest Council also used twelve acres of the estate in 1979 to set up Hawkwood Plant Nursery (its full title was Hawkwood Nursery for Plants and People), for the propagation and cultivation of plants for local authority planting around the borough. They constructed greenhouses covering a substantial area. Over twenty years later, in 2007, the council vacated the site for financial reasons. OrganicLea OrganicLea Community Growers, a workers' co-operative, started in 2001, aiming to produce food locally using organic and permaculture principles. Organiclea Limited was incorporated as a Private Limited Company in 2004. They started with an acre of derelict allotment land near Hawkwood, working with volunteers in exchange for a share of the harvest. This developed into a local food hub, selling organically grown produce from the allotment and from other small-scale organic farmers. The work expanded with a grant from the Big Lottery‚Äôs Making Local Food Work programme, enabling them to establish the Hornbeam Caf√© plus a weekly box scheme and a Cropshare programme, with their mission statement being to \\"produce and distribute food and plants locally, and inspire and support others to do the same ‚Ä¶ bring people together to take action towards a more just and sustainable society.\\" After the closure of Hawkwood Plant Nursery in 2007, OrganicLea negotiated to use the site and facilities, and in 2010 they signed a ten-year lease to use the twelve acres, including the greenhouses. This has allowed significant expansion and has also increased the diversity of activities, which now include not only the production and selling of organic fruit and vegetables, but also training and education, support for community gardening, and working with local schools.

The shogunate system was not established in Japan yet. The famine was most severe in western Honsh≈´ (including Kyoto) and Kyushu islands. The famine was caused by an alternating, untimely drought and flood. During the same period as the famine, there was also the Genpei War (1180-1185), partially caused by famine itself. In 1181, the Taira clan food requisitions in Yamashiro Province for the needs of starving Kyoto city have cost them popular support, while Minamoto no Yoritomo supplied rice for the starving provinces in exchange for grants for independent rule in Kamakura. The famine become worse in 1182, as epidemic was superimposed on scarcity of food. The food prices rose to such levels, what man\`s load of processed timber was not worth the amount of food to survive a day. The riverbanks were lined with the deceased. According to Kojiki, the number of dead in Kyoto was 43200, and shrines were overwhelmed, resulting in improper burials.

Early life Taylor was born in California. He lived in Hollywood, California where he operated a dental practice. An avid yachtsman and swimmer, Taylor was also a licensed pilot. Military service After the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor Taylor enlisted in the US Navy and was assigned to a submarine chaser. Taylor, who had met William J. Donovan briefly before the war, was then recruited to join the OSS, the United States' wartime intelligence agency established in 1942. He was one of the first to join the organization's newly formed Maritime Unit, a precursor to the Navy SEALS. For this reason, Taylor is sometimes informally referred to as the \\"first Navy SEAL\\". Taylor initially served as chief instructor at the Maritime Unit's secret Smith Point training camp in Maryland. In November 1942, Taylor helped inventor Christian J. Lambertsen demonstrate his secret Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit for OSS officer Commander H. G. A. Woolley. The invention would eventually allow the Maritime Unit to undertake clandestine diving missions in support of the Allied forces. In summer 1943, Taylor was deployed to Cairo to gather watercraft for the unit's upcoming missions in the Aegean Sea. Taylor was active before the Battle of Leros, dodging German troops and carrying supplies to MI6 operatives. He often collaborated with American film actor Sterling Hayden, who worked for the OSS Special Operations branch. In September 1943, Taylor was appointed OSS Operations Officer in Italy, where he set up a Maritime Unit branch in the city of Bari to supply Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslav Partisans, a guerilla force fighting against Nazi Germany in occupied Yugoslavia. After the December 1943 air raid on Bari, Taylor relocated the OSS base of operations to Monopoli. Taylor personally led many of the Maritime Unit's covert missions, including one into Albania to rescue a flight of American nurses and medics who had been forced down in the Ceraunian Mountains. On a later trip, Taylor and his men were trapped in Albania for three months, sneaking back into Italy in July 1944 with letters from Albanian nationalist Abaz Kupi. Capture and internment In October 1944, Taylor parachuted into Austria with three OSS operatives to spy on German supply lines around the city of Wiener Neustadt. However, they caught the attention of Gestapo agents and were arrested and sent to the Morzinplatz Gestapo headquarters in Vienna. In March 1945, Taylor was transferred to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex in northern Austria. He was one of the few American inmates in the camp and collected intelligence from fellow inmates regarding the atrocities committed in the camp. Taylor was also part of the slave labor force that built the crematorium used to exterminate the concentration camp prisoners. Suffering from dysentery and starvation, Taylor was scheduled to be executed four times, but was saved by fellow inmates who wanted him to survive to report on the camp conditions. Taylor was spared from execution a fifth time when part of the 11th Armored Division liberated the camp on May 5, 1945. Taylor spent his remaining time in Austria collecting documents and interviewing witnesses to gather evidence against the camp commanders and guards. Post-military career After being honorably discharged in autumn 1945, Taylor returned to civilian life in California. He was briefly reactivated in 1946 to serve as one of the primary witnesses in United States of America vs. Hans Altfuldisch et al.. During the trial, he detailed many of the atrocities committed by Waffen-SS members at the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex, based on the evidence he had helped to gather. According to biographer Patrick O'Donnell, Taylor suffered from symptoms contingent with posttraumatic stress disorder later in his life. He died in a plane crash in May 1959. His OSS files were not declassified until after his death.

The National Security Council of Mongolia (NSC) () is a consultative body to the Office of the President of Mongolia. It focuses mainly on briefing high ranking national security and/or political figures on the state of internal and external threats in Mongolia. It also advises the President in his/her orders to the Mongolian Armed Forces under the Ministry of Defense and the National Police Agency under the Ministry of Justice and Internal Affairs. The NSC is affiliated with the larger Security and Foreign Policy Council (established in April 2010) and the Information and Analytical Council, the latter of which is composed of former politicians, military leaders, diplomats, and academics and intellectual experts. Besides executive leadership of the council by the President as chairman, the post of Secretary of the NSC advises the president in relation to the main missions of the NSC and coordinates work on preparatory decisions and discussions for the council. The current Secretary of the NSC is Amarjargal Gansukh (since 3 November 2017).  History and composition  An article in the newly introduced Constitution of Mongolia (adopted on 13 January 1992) stated that the President will be the chairman of a National Security Council. On 29 May, the State Great Khural established the NSC by adopting a National Security Council Law. This law defined the principles, powers and functions of the NSC. It held its first meeting in August of that year under the chairmanship of President Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat and later on the next July saw the appointment of Jargalsayhany Enhsayhan as secretary. In 1994, a National Security Concept to charter the conditions and situations that the security of Mongolia is in. Over the years, the concept has been renewed multiple times, more recently in July 2010. In March 2019, the NSC became involved in a national constitutional crisis when the State Great Khural adopted an unprecedented law on the proposal of President Khaltmaagiin Battulga on the 27th of that month which effectively gave the NSC the power to recommend the firing of judges, prosecutors and the leaders in the Anti-Corruption Agency.

The decision is notable for partially upholding the freedom of religion in a secular state, which sought to extinguish it. Summary In 2008 Paul Donovan, the principal of a Jesuit catholic high school in Quebec, objected to a government mandated course on religion and ethics. Begun in September 2008, the Ethics and religious culture course (ERC as it is called) is a provincially mandated course that requires schools to teach the basic traditions and symbolisms of a variety of religions. Donovan argued on behalf of Loyola High School that the ERC forbids teachers from teaching, in detail, the reasons why a given religious faith believes what it does believe; any form of instruction that could be perceived as an endorsement of a particular religion or proclaiming it as truth is prohibited and therefore seen by Donovan as a violation of religious freedom, as outlined in the Quebec Charter of Values. An additional concern is that government imposed religious and ethical curricula on institutions like Loyola, could be precedent-setting for government control on other faith based institutions such as churches and associated religious organizations. All schools in Quebec, including religious, private schools, and home schools are obliged by the law to offer the ERC. If faith based schools want to continue their traditional faith education, they are permitted to do so, however it must be in addition to but separate from the ERC. This is viewed by the law's opponents as closed secularism, as opposed to open secularism, and a perversion of the proper understanding of pluralism and, of most concern, a breach of their right to teach the faith. Courts below A Quebec Superior Court agreed with the school's position in 2010, On 18 June 2010, Justice Gerard Dugr√© compared the attempt of the education minister to impose a secular emphasis on Loyola High School's teaching of the course to the intolerance of the Spanish Inquisition. Dugr√© J wrote in his 63-page decision that:https://montrealgazette.com/life/Ruling+calls+imposition+ethics+class+totalitarian/3177787/story.htmlhttps://montrealgazette.com/life/Court+backs+Loyola+over+ethics+course/3173865/story.html In 2012 the Quebec Court of Appeal sided with the government. Supreme Court of Canada On further appeal the Supreme Court of Canada held that the Minister's decision to force the teaching of Catholicism from a neutral standpoint unreasonably violated religious freedom, and was sent back to the Minister for reconsideration. In a stunning departure from the majority, the dissenters wrote that \\"the only constitutional response to Loyola‚Äôs application for an exemption would be to grant it.\\"Loyola High School v Quebec (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 12, [2015 1 SCR 613.] See also *S.L. v Commission scolaire des Ch√™nes *List of Supreme Court of Canada cases References Category:2015 in Canadian case law Category:Canadian administrative case law Category:Canadian constitutional case law Category:Canadian judicial review case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:Religion and education Category:Education in Quebec Category:Multiculturalism in Canada ","title":"Loyola High School v Quebec AG"},{"id":"61232781","text":"Keraia was a town of ancient Pisidia inhabited during Hellenistic and Roman times.

Large numbers of Model 1908 rifles and short rifles was purchased between 1908 and 1914. While DWM was the main manufacturer, Mauser produced 100,000 Model 1908 with DWM Obendorf stamps. Some Mauser 1908 saw combat during the Contestado War. Later, Model 1935 rifles and short rifles were purchased in unknown quantities from Mauser. They were fielded against the Canga√ßo bandits. To improve the country's independence from foreign suppliers, the Model 08/34 was produced in Itajuba. Uruguay received DWM-made Model 1908 rifles and short rifles before 1914 and used them into the 1950s. Several Mystery Mausers, similar to the Model 1908 but chambered in 7.92√ó57mm Mauser, can be found with Arabic markings or an hexagram. In the early 1950s, surplus Brazilian 1908 rifles and short rifles were exported to the Dominican Republic. The Brazilian markings were replaced by Dominican markings and the rifles were designated Model 1953. During the US intervention in the Dominican Civil War, these Mauser rifles were found to be very effective since they had longer range than the M16 rifle.

Reynolds served in the 12th Royal Lancers from 1900 to 1934, seeing action in the Second Boer War and the First World War. He briefly commanded the 1/1st Northumberland Hussars in the latter stages of the First World War, being awarded the Distinguished Service Order while commanding the Hussars. He also played first-class cricket for the Gentlemen, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and Oxford University. First-class cricket and military career The son of Sir Alfred Reynolds, he was born at Islington in March 1879. He was educated at Winchester College, where as captain of the college cricket XI he greeted Queen Victoria on the occasion of her visit to Winchester College as part of her Diamond Jubilee celebrations. From Winchester he went up to New College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he made his debut in first-class cricket for Oxford University against Surrey at The Oval in 1900. He made two further first-class appearances in 1900, playing a further match for Oxford against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's, and appearing for the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixture at The Oval. Two years later, he made a final first-class appearance for the MCC against Oxford University at Lord's in 1903. In addition to playing first- class cricket, Reynolds also played minor counties cricket for Hertfordshire, making seven appearances in the Minor Counties Championship between 1897 and 1906. After graduating from Oxford, he enlisted as a second lieutenant in the 12th Royal Lancers, serving shortly after in the Second Boer War, for which he was mentioned in dispatches. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in September 1902. He fell ill in November 1906 and was placed on half-pay, but had recovered by the following month. He was promoted to the rank of captain in August 1908. He was seconded for service as an adjutant in the Special Reserve in March 1914. World War I and later military career He served in the First World War with the Lancers, during which he was promoted to the rank of major in December 1914. He was made a temporary lieutenant colonel in March 1916, before relinquishing the rank the following month. He took over command of the 1/1st Northumberland Hussars in March 1917, following the return of Colonel John Blencowe Cookson to England. While commanding the 1/1st Northumberland Hussars he was granted the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. While commanding the 1/1st he saw action defending against the German offensive Operation Michael in March 1918. He founded 'Reynolds' Force' on 24 March, three days into the battle, consisting of 120 horses. 'Reynolds' Force' then joined up with other cavalry units, forming what became known as 'Harman's Detachment'. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in the 1919 Birthday Honours. His command of the 1/1st ended in October 1919, at which point he once more relinquished the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel and returned to the Lancers.

This causes cell cycle arrest and cell death by apoptosis. Thus, SINE compounds are of interest as anticancer drugs; several are in development, and one (selinexor) has been approved for treatment of multiple myeloma as a drug of last resort. The prototypical nuclear export inhibitor is leptomycin B, a natural product and secondary metabolite of Streptomyces bacteria. Although it is nonselective and too toxic for clinical use in humans, the discovery of its mechanism of action and antitumor properties prompted development of the SINE compounds. Mechanism of action Ran cycle of nuclear transport. SINE compounds inhibit this process at the nuclear export receptor (upper right). SINEs work by binding to CRM1, a karyopherin which performs nuclear transport of hundreds of proteins‚Äîincluding tumor suppressors, oncogenes, and proteins involved in governing cell growth‚Äîfrom the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. CRM1 it is often overexpressed and misregulated in cancer, and is the sole transporter of many proteins essential for cancer cell proliferation and spread. By restoring nuclear transport of these proteins to normal, SINEs lead to a buildup of tumor suppressors in the nucleus of malignant cells and reduce levels of oncogene products which drive cell growth, ultimately triggering apoptosis. In vitro, this effect appears to spare normal (non-malignant) cells. Nevertheless, because CRM1 is a pleiotropic gene, inhibiting it affects many different systems in the body, which causes a high rate of adverse reactions. Research SINEs have been tested in several preclinical animal models of cancer, including pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, lymphomas, and acute and chronic leukemias. In humans, early clinical trials (phase I) have been conducted in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, blast crisis, and a wide range of advanced or refractory solid tumors, including colon cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer.

He was the founding director of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Greifswald after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the German reunification. From 1994 until 2011, he was chair of philosophy with a focus on practical philosophy.Werner Stegmaier, What is Orientation? A Philosophical Orientation, transl. by Reinhard G. Mueller (Walter de Gruyter: Berlin/Boston, 2019), book cover. His main field of research is the philosophy of orientation. He first published it in the German Philosophie der Orientierung (2008); its English translation has been published as What is Orientation? A Philosophical Investigation (2019). To promote the ideas of this philosophical approach, the Hodges Foundation for Philosophical Orientation was founded in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2018.http://www.hfpo.com; see also: https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2019/10/25/what-is-philosophy- orientation-new-nashville-foundation-wants-tell-you-hodges-foundation- event/4078199002/ His second major field of research is Friedrich Nietzsche‚Äôs philosophy. Both areas of research are integrated in his Nietzsche meets Luhmann. Orientierung im Nihilismus (2016).  Life  After receiving his graduate degree (Staatsexamen) in philosophy, German studies, and Latin philology, he earned his doctorate in philosophy under the supervision of Karl Ulmer and Josef Simon in 1974 at the University of T√ºbingen. He taught for a few years at upper level high schools (Gymnasium) and at the University of Stuttgart. He became research assistant of Josef Simon at the University of Bonn, where he defended his habilitation on Philosophie der Fluktuanz. Dilthey und Nietzsche. In his inaugural address, he dealt with Immanuel Kant‚Äôs treatise What Does It Mean To Orient Oneself in Thinking?, on the basis of which he later developed his Philosophy of Orientation. After serving as an interim professor in Berlin, he went to Greifswald, where he still lives today. Stegmaier founded the North- and East-European Forum for Philosophy, which connected philosophy departments around the Baltic Sea. It organized annual summer schools and supported the philosophical reorientation in countries formerly controlled by the Soviet Union in a project ‚ÄúEmpirical Research on Philosophy,‚Äù supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. From 1997 until 2017, Stegmaier was the chief editor of the journal Nietzsche- Studien. International Yearbook for Nietzsche Research as well as of the Monographs and Texts of Nietzsche Research (both published by Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/Boston). He organized numerous academic conferences about Nietzsche‚Äôs philosophy, the philosophy of orientation, the philosophies of signs and time, the philosophical currentness of the Jewish tradition, and the thinking of Nietzsche and Niklas Luhmann. The philosophy of orientation has spread into the science of sport, linguistics, musicology, psychotherapy, architecture, and theology.  Philosophical work  1\\\\. Substance and Fluctuance Stegmaier discovered in his dissertation that ‚Äòsubstance,‚Äô the foundational concept of metaphysics, which denotes that which persists in being and which Aristotle conceived of as a substance-accident-relation, Descartes as a substance-substance-relation, and Leibniz as a substance- relation-relation, is itself in flux.Werner Stegmaier, Substanz. Grundbegriff der Metaphysik (Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt: Frommann-Holzboog, 1977). Stegmaier coined it in his work on Nietzsche and Dilthey ‚Äòfluctuance,‚Äô i.e. a unit, which can, over time, change and replace all its attributes and thereby completely change its identity.Werner Stegmaier, Philosophie der Fluktuanz. Dilthey und Nietzsche (G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 1992). Following Friedrich Nietzsche and Wilhelm Dilthey, who both philosophically adopt Charles Darwin‚Äôs theory of evolution, believing neither in constant biological species nor in eternally existing universals, Stegmaier consistently put all philosophical and scientific thinking under the condition of time; in doing so, he also engaged with the works of Alfred North Whitehead. 2\\\\. From the Jewish Tradition to the Philosophy of Orientation With Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida, whose philosophies Stegmaier dealt with in numerous publications, his work delved into the Jewish tradition, which has remained largely foreign to the European philosophy that derives from Greek philosophy. The Jewish tradition conceives of the Torah as a source of ever-new orientations. The philosophical concept of orientation was first introduced by Moses Mendelssohn, a Jew who became one of the most famous enlighteners of his time; after his death, the concept was adopted by Immanuel Kant in his ‚ÄúWhat Does It Mean to Orient Oneself in Thinking?‚ÄùWerner Stegmaier, Philosophie der Orientierung (Berlin / New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2008), pp. 63-96. Since then, the term of orientation has widely spread in everyday language use not only in most European, but also many other languages. In his magnum opus, the Philosophie der Orientierung (English: What is Orientation? A Philosophical Investigation), Stegmaier made ‚Äòorientation‚Äô the foundational term of a new philosophy for the present day. In light of relentless orientation crises, the term permeates current debates in both the private and public realm in a hardly noticed way. ‚ÄòOrientation‚Äô is often used, especially in philosophy but also in science, to define other terms, without itself being defined. Because orientation is also required when analyzing orientation itself (in an orientation about orientation), it is an ultimate term, which one perpetually returns to when trying to go behind it.Werner Stegmaier, What is Orientation? A Philosophical Investigation, transl. by Reinhard G. Mueller (Berlin/Boston: Walter de Gruyter, 2019), pp. 8-9. Orientation is factually self-referential as well: if one orients oneself in a situation, the situation changes, and the new situation requires a new orientation. But since all situations are different, one cannot expect universally valid orientations. For Stegmaier, orientation precedes all cognition and action; therefore, all cognition and action must and can be conceived of in the specific structures of orientation. Orientation structures itself by relying on ‚Äòfootholds‚Äô (German, Anhaltspunkte), which it gathers, based on its own needs, in the situations it is in. Orientation orders them, from a specific standpoint within a specific horizon in a specific perspective, in recognizable patterns, and it abbreviates them into signs that allow for communication and thus for an orientation to other orientations. Footholds and signs, however, always allow for leeways (German, Spielr√§ume) for interpretation, which each orientation performs in its own way; one always orients oneself ‚Äòto‚Äô something within individual and situational leeways.Ibid., pp. 55-65. According to Stegmaier, this is true for scientific facts as well, to which one orients oneself in various methodically disciplined manners. Orientations find hold not in any existing universals, but in (everyday or scientific) routines, which develop over time and thus may become so self-evident that they are no longer noticed and thus (more or less) vanish from consciousness. In this way, routines relieve an orientation. Thinking, which traditional philosophy has relied on without question, arises when routines are disrupted or disturbed, including language routines; it creates distances from that which appears self-evident establishing its own hold in its own orders, among which is logic. But logic, too, is a specific kind of orientation, especially the scientific one; it does not belong to the world per se.Ibid., pp. 103-109. Orientation to another orientation are doubly contingent (here, Stegmaier adopts the concept of Talcott Parsons and Niklas Luhmann): others can, in interaction and communication, always react in a different way than you expect it; and both interlocutors know this. All societal orders (according to Luhmann: the functional systems of the communication of society) must deal with this double contingency.Ibid., pp. 130-136. Stegmaier shows how this takes place in economics, politics, the law, science, art, and religion; how all these societal orientation worlds orient individuals, and how individuals in turn orient themselves to them.Ibid., pp. 155-204. They professionalize specific needs of orientation. In ethics, Stegmaier distinguishes between moral orientation, as a self-binding commitment due to certain norms and values, and ethical orientation, as the reflection of such self-bindings and the forgoing of reciprocity and universality.Ibid., pp. 238-240. In this way, he obtains the rightful place for virtues, which are greatly appreciated by everyone, but which moral philosophers have so far less taken into account, such as open- mindedness and unbiasedness, benevolence and friendliness, tactfulness, nobility, and goodness.Ibid., pp. 240-245. Eventually, Stegmaier shows how standardizations permit conceiving of our world orientation in terms of global communication, how traditional metaphysics can be considered a mode of orientation, and what the significance of death is for orientation.Ibid., respectively, pp. 247-264, pp. 265-273, and pp. 275-285. 3\\\\. Nietzsche Research In Nietzsche research, where he has earned an immense influence, Stegmaier has gained prominence by claiming that the famous doctrines of the overman (√úbermensch) and the eternal recurrence of the same and of the will to power (which Nietzsche puts into the mouth of his Zarathustra, the protagonist of his famous poem), are all ‚Äúanti-doctrines,‚Äù i.e. doctrines that undermine the very assumption of any existing universals; their anti-doctrinal character is where, according to Stegmaier, they find their unity.Werner Stegmaier, \\"Nietzsche's Doctrines, Nietzsche's Signs,\\" Journal of Nietzsche Studies 31 (Spring 2006), pp. 20-41. With what he calls ‚Äòcontextual interpretation,‚Äô i.e. understanding Nietzsche‚Äôs philosophical content within the context of his forms of writing, Stegmaier established a methodic paradigm for Nietzsche studies, which he himself comprehensively exemplifies in his interpretation of the 5th book of Nietzsche‚Äôs The Gay Science.Werner Stegmaier, Nietzsche's Befreiung der Philosophie. Kontextuelle Interpretation des V. Buchs der Fr√∂hlichen Wissenschaft (Berlin/Boston: Walter de Gruyter, 2012). This paradigm has gained great attention in Nietzsche research. In his most recent works, he has shown in numerous contributions how Nietzsche‚Äôs foundational distinctions in philosophy can, in connection with Luhmann‚Äôs sociological systems theory, further be developed in the 21st century.For instance, Werner Stegmaier, Luhmann meets Nietzsche.

On August 5, 1982, Father Reynaldo Rivera, a priest at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis in Santa Fe, New Mexico, was murdered in an unknown location, and his body found three days later. A year and a half later, Father John Kerrigan, of the Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Ronan, Montana, disappeared after leaving a bakery in downtown Ronan. Several days later, bloodied articles of clothing were found along Montana Highway 35, as well as a blood-stained coat hanger. Kerrigan's vehicle was discovered in Polson seven days later. His wallet, which contained $1,200, was left in the trunk of the car, along with a bloody shovel and pillowcase. Kerrigan's remains have never been recovered. Though a definitive connection between them has not been discovered, the murders of both Rivera and Kerrigan have been linked due to the fact that Kerrigan also had ties to New Mexico prior to being appointed at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena. Additional parallels were uncovered at the respective crime scenes. In 1988, their cases were profiled together on the documentary series Unsolved Mysteries. During this broadcast, it was revealed that Kerrigan had been subject of numerous sexual abuse allegations. In 2015, the Diocese of Helena published an extensive list of clergy and staff who had been implicated in sexual abuse of minors, in which Kerrigan was included. Subjects =Fr. Reynaldo Rivera= Fr. Reynaldo Rivera served as priest of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis The Reverend Father Reynaldo John Rivera (born October 29, 1924 ), a Catholic priest of the Franciscan order, served at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis in Santa Fe, New Mexico. On the evening of August 5, 1982, a phone call was placed to the rectory by a man who went by the name Michael Carmello; he claimed his grandfather was dying near a rest stop in Waldo, and that he had requested his last rites. Father Patrick Gerard, the priest who answered the call, told the man that his eyesight was too poor for him to safely drive, and asked that he call back momentarily. Rivera took the second call, and agreed to meet the man and perform his grandfather's last rites. The caller stated he would be waiting for Rivera in a blue pickup truck. Days later, Rivera's body was found several miles away from the rest stop lying in a muddy field near the Waldo exit on Interstate 25. He had been shot once in the stomach and strangled with wire, possibly a coat hanger. His brown 1974 Chevrolet Malibu sedan was discovered parked at a rest stop on Interstate 40 near Grants, its gas tank empty. Rivera's last rites kit was never found. The Federal Bureau of Investigation intervened in the investigation, and produced a psychological portrait of the person(s) responsible for Rivera's death; the forensic psychologist determined the motive for Rivera's murder was revenge. Law enforcement briefly considered a recent parolee a suspect, but he was ruled out due to his alibi, as well as his fingerprints not matching the unknown prints discovered on Rivera's vehicle. Another unnamed suspect, a former Santa Fe resident who later moved to New York, was considered a suspect. =Fr. John Kerrigan= Bloodied clothing belonging to Kerrigan was found along the south shore of Flathead Lake The Reverend Father John Patrick Kerrigan (born January 20, 1926), had served as a priest in Plains, Montana, before being transferred to the Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Ronan, on July 18, 1984. On the evening of July 20, two days after Kerrigan's arrival and appointment in the church, he left a bakery in downtown Ronan. This was the last time he was seen. Kerrigan failed to report for his 6:30 a.m. mass on July 21, and a missing person report was filed on July 23. On July 29, articles of bloody clothing were found lying alongside Montana Highway 35 on the shores of Flathead Lake near Polson, along with a bloodied coat hanger; these items were located roughly from Ronan. On July 30, Kerrigan's vehiclealso a brown Chevrolet Malibuwas discovered abandoned several miles away. In the trunk, Kerrigan's wallet, which contained US$1,200, was found, along with a blood-stained shovel and pillow case. Though Kerrigan's remains have never been recovered, he is believed to have been murdered. Investigation Following Kerrigan's disappearance, New Mexico law enforcement were notified of the case due to the similarities to that of Rivera's. Similarities between the victims included their shared vehicles, as well as the manners in which they were murdered (or believed to have been murdered): In both incidents, the vehicles of the men were driven away from the scenes of their murders, and there was evidence that wire coat hangers had been used; Rivera's autopsy showed that he had been strangled with some form of metal cord, possibly a coat hanger, while in Kerrigan's disappearance, a tangled, bloody coat hanger was found along with his clothing. Both men were also priests who belonged to the Franciscan order, and both were approximately 58 years old at the time of their respective deaths and disappearances. Law enforcement attempted to uncover further connections between Kerrigan and Rivera, and determined that Kerrigan had spent time at the Congregation of the Servants of the Paraclete in Jemez Springs, New Mexico in 1983, prior to his appointment in the Helena Diocese in Montana. This congregation was used as a retreat for clergy suffering from personal difficulties, such as substance abuse, depression, and sexual misconduct. Though the Diocese of Helena admitted Kerrigan had spent nearly a year there, they did not disclose the reason. No evidence was uncovered that Kerrigan and Rivera ever knew one another personally. In November 1984, Lieutenant Gilbert Ulibarri, a police officer in Santa Fe, stated that he had \\"a gut feeling\\" that the two crimes were related, and were likely committed by \\"a drifter who has a psychological problem with priests.\\" Despite the parallels in the crimes, Eric Lucero, a New Mexico State Police detective, insisted in 1992 that there was \\"no connection whatsoever\\" between the murder of Rivera and the disappearance of Kerrigan. Two days after Kerrigan disappeared, 31-year-old schoolteacher Curtis Holmen went missing from Missoula, and his vehicle was found abandoned approximately from where Kerrigan's was discovered. Though there was no evidence connecting the two disappearances, Holmen's brother publicly insisted that they may be linked due to the proximity in location and time frame. , Holmen's whereabouts are also unknown. In 2015, after two groups of individuals brought a 2011 class action lawsuit against the Diocese of Helena for sexual abuse, the Diocese published a list of 80 clergy members who had been suspected or implicated in the sexual abuse of minors. Kerrigan was included among those on this list, which consisted largely of priests and nuns. In 2020, Brian D'Ambrosio, author of Montana Murders: Notorious and Unsolved, revealed on a podcast of the same name that more than 35 years later that he now had access to the notes of the lead detective on the Father Kerrigan case. D'Ambrosio posited an alternative theory based on the notes, claiming that it was possible that Kerrigan staged the crime scene and faked his own death, perhaps even with assistance from the Diocese. http://www.montana-mint.com/2020/10/15/the-vanishing-of-a-priest/ See also *List of unsolved deaths References External links *Case profile at Unsolved.com * Category:1980s missing person cases Category:1982 in New Mexico Category:1982 murders in the United States Category:1984 in Montana Category:Catholic Church sexual abuse scandals in the United States Category:Missing person cases in Montana Category:Missing person cases in New Mexico Category:Murdered Roman Catholic priests Category:Unsolved murders in the United States ","title":"1980s Franciscan priest murders"},{"id":"61233182","text":"3-Mercaptopropionitrile is the organosulfur compound with the formula HSCH2CH2CN.

Parergon (paÀàr…ôrÀåg√§n, plural: parerga) is an ancient Greek philosophical concept defined as a supplementary issue. Parergon is also referred to as \\"embellishment\\" or extra. The literal meaning of the ancient Greek term is \\"beside, or additional to the work\\". According to Jacques Derrida, it is \\"summoned and assembled like a supplement because of the lack - a certain 'internal indetermination - in the very thing it enframes\\". It is added to a system to augment something lacking such as in the case of ergon (function, task or work), with parergon constituting an internal structural link that makes its unity possible. Socrates used parergon as the term to describe the violation of the \\"one man, one job\\" rule.  Concept  Parergon is viewed negatively, particularly within Greek classical thought, since it is against ergon or the true matter. Socrates used parergon to refer to the violation of the Athenian rule of \\"one man, one job\\", criticizing supplementary occupations that keep the citizens from specialization and works they are naturally fitted. His criticism also stemmed from the accusation that philosophy is a type of parergon. In the Republic, he explained that paideia ‚Äì the rearing and education of the ideal member of the polis or state ‚Äì must not be considered equivalent to parergon. The emphasis stems from the perception that both connote a relationship to the essential function, expressed in a rigorous definition. The Socratic dialogue established that paideia does not indicate the possibility of changing the main issue and does not indicate marginality but these were identified as characteristics of parergon. Plato considered parergon as something that is secondary and that his philosophical discourse is often against it, explaining how it is against and beyond the ergon, conceptualized as the work accomplished. Parergon was included in Plato's work Laws, where it was compared with the concepts of paideia and deuteron. These two terms were both cited as superior in importance in the sense that they must be taken more seriously than parergon. In Greek philosophy, however, parergon is not considered incidental.  Modern descriptions  Immanuel Kant also used parergon in his philosophy. In his works, he associated it with ergon, which in his view is the \\"work\\" of one's field (e.g. work of art, work of literature, and work of music, etc.). According to Kant, parergon is what is beyond ergon. It is what columns are to buildings or the frame to a painting. He provided three examples of parergon: 1) clothing on a statue; 2) columns on a building; and, 3) the frame of a painting. He likened it to an ornament, one that primarily appeals to the senses. Kant's conceptualization influenced Derrida's usage of the term, particularly how it served as an agent of deconstruction using Kant's conceptualization of the painting's frame. Parergon is also described as separate - that it is detached not only from the thing it enframes but also from the outside (the wall where a painting is hung or the space in which the object stands). This conceptualization underscores the significance of parergon for thinkers such as Derrida and Heidegger as it makes the split in the duality of intellect/senses. It plays an important rule in aesthetic judgment if it augments the pleasure of taste. It diminishes in value if it is not formally beautiful, lapsing as a simple adornment. According to Kant, this case is like a gilt frame of a painting, a mere attachment to gain approval through its charm and could even detract from the genuine beauty of the art. Derrida cited parergon in his wider theory of deconstruction, using it with the term \\"supplement\\" to denote the relationship between the core and the periphery and reverse the order of priority so that it becomes possible for the supplement ‚Äì the outside, secondary and inessential ‚Äì to be the core or the centerpiece. In The Truth in Painting, the philosopher likened parergon with the frame, borders, and marks of boundaries, which are capable of \\"unfixing\\" any stability so that conceptual oppositions are dismantled. It is, for the philosopher, \\"neither work (ergon) nor outside work\\", disconcerting any opposition while not remaining indeterminate. For Derrida, parergon is also fundamental, particularly to the ergon since, without it, it \\"cannot distinguish itself from itself\\". In artistic works, parergon is viewed as separate from an artwork it frames but merges with the milieu, which allows it to merge with the work of art. In a book, parergon can be the liminal devices that mediate it to its reader such as title, foreword, epigraph, preface, etc. It can also be a short literary piece added to the main volume such as the case of James Beattie's The Castle of Scepticism. This is an allegory written as a parergon and was included in the philosopher's main work called Essay on truth, which criticized David Hume, Voltaire, and Thomas Hobbes.

Caroline minuscule, 9th- century, probably Lorsch. Rufinus the Syrian or Rufinus of Syria (fl. c. 400) was a Christian theologian, priest and author, generally identified as a Pelagian.\\"Rufinus (fl. 399‚Äì401?)\\", in F. L. Cross and E. A. Livingstone, eds., The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3 rev. ed. (Oxford University Press, 2005 [online 2009]). According to the anti-Pelagian writer Marius Mercator, Rufinus \\"of the Syrian nation\\" (natione Syrus) taught at Rome during the episcopate of Anastasius I (399‚Äì401) and through this teaching was a bad influence on the theology of Pelagius and his followers. There is disagreement between scholars over the correct reading of the word preceding natione Syrus: it is either quidam (\\"a nobody of Syrian race\\") or quondam (\\"at one time of the nation of Syria\\"). Walter Dunphy even argues that whole phrase is ultimately a copyist's error and that there was no Rufinus from Syria.Stuart Squires, The Pelagian Controversy: An Introduction to the Enemies of Grace and the Conspiracy of Lost Souls (Pickwick, 2019), pp. 61‚Äì67. There are a total of seven references to persons named Rufinus from around 400 and scholars are unsure how many individuals lie behind them. There are three other Rufinuses who are often identified with the Mercator's Syrian Rufinus. If \\"Syrian\\" was being used in its broad sense (i.e., of Syria Palaestina), then Mercator's Rufinus may be identical to the Rufinus who was a monk in Bethlehem and went on a mission to the West for Jerome in early 399. The Syrian Rufinus is usually identified with the Rufinus who wrote the Liber de fide (Book of Faith), which survives in a single manuscript, now MS Q. v. 1. 6 in the Saint Petersburg Public Library. The manuscript describes the author as a priest from the province of Palestine. In this work Rufinus attacks Arianism, Origenism and the doctrine of original sin. The work was for a long time ascribed erroneously to Tyrannius Rufinus. The latter, also called Rufinus of Aquileia, was definitely a different person. The Syrian Rufinus is usually also identified with the \\"holy priest\\" mentioned by Caelestius at his trial in Carthage in 411. At that time the priest was already dead.

Mature buds are spindle-shaped, long and about wide with a horn-shaped operculum about the same length as the floral cup. Flowering occurs in summer and the flowers are white. The fruit is a sessile, woody, cup-shaped to shortened hemispherical capsule about long and wide with the valves below the rim of the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus forresterae was first formally described in 2011 by Kevin Rule and William Molyneux in the journal Muelleria but the description was not valid because no holotype was designated. A subsequent edition of the same journal corrected the typification. The specific epithet (forresterae) honours Sue Forrester who collected the type specimens with Molyneux. Distribution Brumby sallee is only known from a few rocky sites at altitudes above in the Cobberas Range. Conservation status This species is listed as \\"endangered\\" on the Victorian Government's Department of Sustainability and Environment's Advisory List of Rare Or Threatened Plants In Victoria.

It exists by virtue of the Food and Drugs Act. Its goal is \\"to protect human and animal health and the safety of Canada's food supply\\". The Directorate puts all \\"veterinary products, such antimicrobials, growth promotion drugs and feed additives, through a rigorous approval process before they are licensed and sold for use\\" in Canada. History =on AMR= The WHO has defined \\"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)\\" as \\"the ability of a microorganism (like bacteria, viruses, and some parasites) to stop an antimicrobial (such as antibiotics, antivirals and antimalarials) from working against it. As a result, standard treatments become ineffective, infections persist and may spread to other [people].\\" In 2011, Manisha Mehrotra, at the time director of the human safety division within the Directorate spoke passionately about the need to crack down on the use of antibiotics such as cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in the Canadian meat industry because of the risk of creating antibiotic resistant strains of viruses. On 1 December 2018, \\"all medically important antimicrobials currently available over the counter for veterinary use, including those used in companion and food animals and in all dosage forms\\", were moved to prescription status. Antimicrobials are no longer to be used for growth promotion in Canada from this date. Leadership The Director-General from 2005 to 2007 was Siddika Mithani, who was once the President of the Public Health Agency of Canada, and is now the President of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The Directorate has been led since at least June 2017 by Dr. Mary-Jane Ireland.

She also wrote, owned several bookstores, and ran the Minnesota Writers' Project during the 1930s.  Early life  Mabel Palmer Simis was from Vails Gate, New York, the daughter of Adolph Simis Jr. and Emma Van Duzen Simis. Her father was born in Germany, and a United States Navy veteran of the American Civil War. He was Commissioner of Charities for Brooklyn and Queens at the time of his death in 1900. Mabel Simis graduated from Cornell University in 1897, served as a naval hospital nurse in 1898, and earned her medical degree at Johns Hopkins University in 1901.  Career  = Medicine and public health = Ulrich practiced medicine in Minneapolis, where she served on the vice commission, the Board of Public Welfare, and the Health and Hospitals committee. She was a student health advisor to young women at the University of Minnesota, and Supervisor of Social Hygiene Education in the Division of Veneral Diseases at the state Board of Health. She spoke in favor of eugenics education in high schools at a teachers' conference in Montana in 1913, but favored preventive measures such as education and premarital health certificates, and denounced eugenic sterilization. In 1914, Ulrich was appointed by the YWCA to tour schools and colleges, lecturing on sex and hygiene subjects. In 1916, she gave a summer institute for teachers interested in teaching sex education classes. Her pamphlet \\"Mothers of America\\" (1919), aimed at young women, has been described as an unusually direct, detailed, and informative example of the genre from before World War I. Another Ulrich pamphlet was \\"The Girl's Part\\" (1918). She debated with Alice Stone Blackwell in an essay in The Woman Citizen in 1919; she was in favor of laws confining women with sexually-transmitted diseases, Blackwell was opposed. = Writing and books = Beyond medicine and public health, Ulrich was interested in writing. She published short fiction, including \\"The Swede's Angel\\" (1905), and a play, Daylight Saving (1933). She opened a bookstore in Minneapolis in 1921, and by 1927 owned five bookshops in Minnesota. Her shops also sold rare prints. In 1931, she was appointed to head of the Minnesota implementation of the Federal Writers' Project, a program of the federal Works Progress Administration. She resigned that post in 1938. She edited a collection of essays by women, titled The More I See Of Men (Harper & Brothers, 1932), with an introduction by Frederick Lewis Allen.Ulrich, Mabel S., ed.

Roosevelt administration was the foreign policy of the United States from 1933 to 1945, under the Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, first and second terms, and the Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, third and fourth terms. Roosevelt kept personal control of foreign-policy in the White House, and for that he depended heavily on Henry Morgenthau Jr., Sumner Welles, and Harry Hopkins. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Cordell Hull handled routine matters; the president ignored Hull on most major issues. Roosevelt was an internationalist, and Congress favored more isolationist solutions, so there was considerable tension before the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. During the war years, treaties were few, and diplomacy played a secondary role in high-level negotiations with the Allies of World War II, especially Britain's Winston Churchill and the Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin. The 1930s were a high point of isolationism in the United States. The key foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt's first term was the Good Neighbor Policy, in which the U.S. took a non-interventionist stance in Latin American affairs. Foreign policy issues came to the fore in the late 1930s, as Nazi Germany, Japan, and Italy took aggressive actions against other countries. In response to fears that the United States would be drawn into foreign conflicts, Congress passed the Neutrality Acts, a series of laws that prevented trade with belligerents. After Japan invaded China and Germany invaded Poland, Roosevelt provided aid to China, Britain, and France, but public opinion opposed use of the American military. After the Fall of France in June 1940, Roosevelt increased aid to the British and began a very rapid build-up of air power. In the 1940 presidential election, Roosevelt defeated Republican Wendell Willkie, an internationalist who largely refrained from criticizing Roosevelt's foreign policy. Unlike his first two terms in office, Roosevelt's third and fourth terms were dominated by war issues. Roosevelt won congressional approval of the Lend-Lease program, which was designed to aid allies warring against Germany and Japan. After Germany declared war on the Soviet Union, Roosevelt extended Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union as well. In Asia, Roosevelt provided aid to the Republic of China, which was resisting a largely successful invasion by the Japanese. In response to the July 1941 Japanese occupation of southern French Indochina, Roosevelt expanded a trade embargo on Japan. After attempting to re-open oil exports, Japan launched an attack on the U.S. fleet stationed at Pearl Harbor. The United States became belligerent in December 1941 after Congress responded in kind to declarations of war by Japan, Germany, and Italy. The leading Allied Powers the U.S.. Britain, China, Soviet Union, and (by courtesy) China. The Allies agreed on a Europe first strategy, but in practice the American war effort focused on Japan before 1943.\\"Indeed throughout 1942, more US forces were deployed against Japan than against Germany, despite continued formal agreement to the Europe-first approach\\" states Mark A. Stoler, \\"George C. Marshall and the\\" Europe-First\\" Strategy, 1939-1951: A Study in Diplomatic as well as Military History.\\" Journal of Military History 79.2 (2015) online at p. 299 n 18. Britain and the U.S. began the campaign against Germany with an invasion of North Africa in late 1942, winning decisively in May 1943. Meanwhile, the United States won a decisive victory over Japan in the Battle of Midway and began a campaign of island hopping in the Pacific Ocean. In 1943, the Allies launched an invasion of Italy and continued to pursue the island-hopping strategy. The major Allied leaders met at the Tehran Conference in 1943, where they began to discuss post-war plans. Among the concepts discussed was the United Nations, an intergovernmental organization championed by Roosevelt that would replace the League of Nations after the war. In 1944, the U.S. launched a successful invasion of northern France and won a decisive naval victory over Japan in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. By the time of Roosevelt's death in April 1945, the U.S. had occupied portions of Germany and was in the process of capturing Okinawa. That island was needed to begin all-out bombing of Japan. Germany and Japan would both surrender within six months of Roosevelt's death. First term foreign policy Four basic principles undergirded Roosevelt's foreign policy approach when he took office. As Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. explains: :One was TR's [Theodore Roosevelt's] belief in the preservation of the balance of world power. A second was Wilson dream of concerted international action to keep the peace. The third was the conviction that peace and political collaboration rested on commercial harmony among nations and therefore required a freely trading world. The fourth principle was the imperative necessary in a democracy of basing foreign-policy on domestic consent. The first three principles were inevitably qualified and compromised by the fourth.Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., \\"Franklin D. Roosevelt's Internationalism\\" in =Good Neighbor Policy and trade= Roosevelt's first inaugural address contained just one sentence devoted to foreign policy, indicative of the domestic focus of his first term.George C. Herring, From Colony to Superpower; U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776 (2008), p. 484. The main foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt's first term was what he called the Good Neighbor Policy, which continued the move begun by Coolidge and Hoover toward a more non-interventionist policy in Latin America. American forces were withdrawn from Haiti, and a new treaty with Panama ended its status as protectorates, While continuing American control of the Panama Canal Zone. John Major, \\"FDR and Panama.\\" Historical Journal 28.2 (1985): 357-377. Although Roosevelt wanted to disengage from Cuba, his first ambassador Sumner Welles became enmeshed in The selection of a Cuban president. By late 1933 Roosevelt had appointed Jefferson Caffrey as the new ambassador . In January 1934 Carlos Mendieta who was approved by Caffrey, formed a government that was quickly recognized by Washington. The United States then did disengage, and did not protest when it was overthrown by Fulgencio Batista in 1934.Irwin F. Gellman, Roosevelt and Batista: Good Neighbor Diplomacy in Cuba, 1933‚Äì1945 (1973) In December 1933, Roosevelt signed the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries.William E. Leuchtenburg, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, 1932‚Äì1940 (1963) pp. 203‚Äì10.Graham Stuart, \\"The Results of the Good Neighbor Policy In Latin America' World Affairs 102#3 (September, 1939), pp. 166-170 online Following the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Haiti, the only U.S. military forces remaining in the Caribbean were stationed in the Panama Canal Zone or the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.David M. Kennedy, Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) pp 391‚Äì392. In 1934, Congress enacted Cordell Hull's key program, the Reciprocal Tariff Act. It allowed the president to negotiate trade reciprocity treaties with other countries. Over the next six years, the U.S. signed agreements with 21 countries, primarily in Latin America. resulting in a significant reduction of tariff levels. online Thanks to the reciprocal tariffs and the new Export‚ÄìImport Bank, trade between the U.S. and Latin America more than tripled between 1931 and 1941. Mexico During the presidency of Mexico's revolutionary general L√°zaro C√°rdenas del R√≠o, the controversy over petroleum again flared. Standard Oil had major investments in Mexico and a dispute between the oil workers and the company was to be resolved via the Mexican court system. The dispute, however, escalated, and on March 18, 1938, President C√°rdenas used constitutional powers to expropriate foreign oil interests in Mexico and created the government-owned Petroleos Mexicanos or PEMEX. Although the United States had had a long history of interventions in Latin America, the expropriation did not result in that. Roosevelt was implementing the Good Neighbor Policy, with an eye to better relations which would be vital if war broke out in Europe. However, with the Great Depression, the United States implemented a program of expelling Mexicans from the U.S. in what was known as Mexican Repatriation. Under President L√°zaro C√°rdenas Mexico in 1934-40 expropriated three million acres of agricultural land owned by 300 Americans. Its worth was a matter of debate: between $19 million and $102 million, but nothing was paid. Roosevelt settled the matter in 1938 quietly. He refused to aggressively intervene in Mexican agrarian disputes in order not to disrupt trade. He was sympathetic to Mexican president L√°zaro C√°rdenas's agrarian reform program, as was ambassador Josephus Daniels. On the other hand Secretary Hull was antagonistic. John J.

The two nations set up a Mexico-United States Defense Board which focused on defending Baja California against Japanese threats. On June 1, 1942 Mexico declared war on Germany, Italy and Japan. In August, 1942 the Bracero program began, and the first 75,000 farmworkers arrived in California at the end of September. A steady flow provided the labor needed to expand California's agricultural output to meet wartime demands. Other problems were resolved, such as a long conflict over the water of the Colorado River, with a February 1944 treaty that met Mexico's water needs. Michael Mathes, \\"The Two Californias during World War II,\\" California Historical Society Quarterly (1965) 44#4 pp 323-331. =Recognition of the Soviet Union= By the late 1920s, the Soviet Union was no longer a pariah in European affairs, and had normal diplomatic and trade relations with most countries. By 1933, old American fears of Communist threats had faded, and the business community, as well as newspaper editors, were calling for diplomatic recognition. Roosevelt was eager for large-scale trade with Russia, and hoped for some repayment on the old tsarist debts. After the Soviets promised they would not engage in espionage, Roosevelt used presidential authority to normalize relations in November 1933. There were few complaints about the move. There was no progress on the debt issue, however, and the Kremlin set up an active espionage program.Edward Moore Bennett, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the search for security: American-Soviet relations, 1933‚Äì1939 (1985). Many American businessmen had expected a bonus in terms of large-scale trade, but it never materialized.Joan H.

However The Connally Amendment of 1944 reserved the right of the United States to refuse to abide by its decisions. Margaret A.

He instructed the American representative to Geneva to say that if there was a threat to peace the United States was willing to cooperate with collective efforts made by other states to restore peace. Congress however immediately rejected this initiative by requiring that any embargo on arms shipments to aggressor nations, had to apply equally to victims of aggression. The neutrality laws of the mid-1930s forbade the president to discriminate between aggressor and victim, which effectively prevented Roosevelt from acting against aggression. When Congress rejected his proposal to join the world World Court, FDR commented, \\"Today, quite frankly, the wind everywhere blows against us.\\" Schlesinger, p.10. John C. Donovan, \\"Congressional Isolationists and the Roosevelt Foreign Policy.\\" World Politics 3.3 (1951): 299-316. The 1930s marked the high point of American isolationism. The country had a long tradition of non-interventionism, but isolationists in the 1930s sought to keep the U.S. out of world affairs to an unprecedented degree. Isolationist sentiment stemmed from a desire to focus on domestic issues, bitterness over World War I and unpaid war debts, and fears that bankers (many of them Jewish like the RothschildsEdward S. Shapiro, \\"The Approach of War: Congressional Isolationism and Anti-Semitism, 1939‚Äì1941.\\" American Jewish History 74.1 (1984): 45-65.) and munitions makers intrigued to involve the United States and European wars in order to make profits.Wayne S. Cole, Roosevelt & the isolationists, 1932-45 (1983). public opinion showed a strong detachment from, and reluctance to become involved in, the growing crises in Europe. Responding to the country's isolationist mood, Roosevelt in the 1930s never mentioned his previous support for joining the League of Nations. Learning from Wilson's mistakes, Roosevelt avoided provoking isolationist sentiment.Robert Dallek, Franklin D Roosevelt And American Foreign Policy 1932 1945 (1979) p. 112 online Roosevelt was especially reluctant to clash with progressive Republicans senators like George Norris, Robert La Follette, Hiram Johnson, and William Borah, all of whom provided support for his domestic programs, while demanding he follow isolationism. The isolationist movement dramatically publicized its conspiracy theories in 1934-1936 through hearings by the Nye Committee of Congress, which investigated the role of business interests in pushing the United States into World War I.John Edward Wiltz, \\"The Nye Committee Revisited.\\" Historian 23.2 (1961): 211-233. online =Worsening international situation and American neutrality= The Great Depression of the 1930s saw global economic hardships, a decline in trade and a retreat of democracy and international cooperation. Instead there was a sharp rise in authoritarian governments, economic autarch, and aggressive threats, especially from Germany and Japan. The American response was a retreat from international political, economic and military involvement.Alonzo L.

In 1931, the Empire of Japan invaded Manchuria and established the puppet state of Manchukuo. The Japanese dispatched hundreds of thousands of colonists to Manchukuo, which possessed raw materials and agricultural resources that were in short supply in Japan. The United States and the League of Nations both condemned the invasion, but none of the great powers made any move to evict Japan from the region, and the Japanese appeared poised to further expand their empire. In a direct challenge to the Western powers, Japan proclaimed the Amau doctrine, which stated that Japan alone held responsibility for maintaining order in East Asia. In 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came into power in Germany. At first, many in the United States thought of Hitler as something of a comic figure, but Hitler quickly consolidated his power in Germany and attacked the post-war order established by the Treaty of Versailles.Burns (1956), p. 261. Hitler preached a racist doctrine of Aryan superiority, and his central foreign policy goal was the acquisition of territory to Germany's east, which he sought to repopulate with Germans. Foreign affairs became a more prominent issue by 1935. Italy, under a fascist regime led by Benito Mussolini, invaded Ethiopia, earning international condemnation.Burns (1956), p. 256. In response, Congress passed the first of a series of Neutrality Acts. The Neutrality Act of 1935 required Roosevelt to impose an arms embargo on all belligerents in any given foreign war, without any discretion left to the president. Though he privately opposed the Neutrality Act of 1935 and its successors, Roosevelt signed the bills order to preserve his political capital for his domestic agenda. In 1936, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, though they never coordinated their strategies.Burns (1956), p. 261. That same year, Germany and Italy formed a weak alliance through the Rome-Berlin Axis agreement. Roosevelt saw the threat that these rising powers posed, but focused instead on reviving the U.S. economy during the early part of his presidency. Hitler and other world leaders, meanwhile, believed that the U.S. would be reluctant to intervene in world affairs. They saw the U.S. withdrawal from Latin America, the Neutrality Acts, and the 1934 Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act, which promised independence to the Philippines after a ten-year transition period, as indicative of the strength of isolationism in the United States. In July 1936, civil war broke out in Spain between the left-wing Republican government and right-wing Nationalist rebels lead by General Francisco Franco. Britain and France remained neutral and worked to get the major powers to agree to an arms embargo on both sides. In solidarity with them, Roosevelt recommended to Congress a nondiscriminatory arms embargo in January 1937, and won near- unanimous approval. Though privately supportive of the Republicans, Roosevelt feared the Spanish crisis might escalate to a full-scale European war and cooperated with the other democracies to contain the conflict. He also did not want to alienate American Catholics, a key element of his coalition; Catholic leaders were mostly pro-Franco. By spring 1938, as it was clear that Hitler and Mussolini were aiding Franco, Roosevelt was considering a plan to secretly sell American warplanes to the Spanish government, but nothing came of it. As the Nationalists were achieving victory in early 1939, Roosevelt would refer to the embargo as a mistake. While Britain and France would recognize Franco's regime on February 27 of that year, Roosevelt held out until April 1, days after Franco achieved full victory with the capture of Madrid.. Roosevelt managed to ingeniously use the neutrality laws to support his largely internationalist outlook. Without officially endorsing them, he followed the League of Nations sanctions against Italy regarding its invasion of Ethiopia in 1936. He enforced the 1935 neutrality law against the purchase of weapons by either side, but only Italy had the money to buy them. He called for a moral embargo on oil sales to Italy. During the Spanish Civil War, 1936-39, he supported the international nonintervention policy by invoking the neutrality act to prohibit arms sales to both sides. When Japan invaded China in 1937, he refused to call it a war, which allowed arms sales to China. David M Kennedy, \\"Franklin D. Roosevelt,\\" in Henry F. Graff, ed., The Presidents: A Reference History (2nd ed. 1997) p 436. =War clouds= Territorial control in the Western Pacific Rim in 1939 The inability of the League of Nations or any one else to stop the Italian invasion of Ethiopia emboldened Japan and Germany to pursue their territorial ambitions. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Japan invaded China in July 1937, capturing Chinese capital of Nanjing (or Nanking) before the end of the year. The Nanking Massacre and the USS Panay incident both outraged Americans, many of whom favored China due to American missionaries and cultural works like The Good Earth, but the Neutrality Acts blocked arms sales to China. In a reflection of the continuing strength of isolationism, the Ludlow Amendment, which would have required a national referendum for any declaration of war, was only narrowly defeated in the House. Roosevelt gained world attention with his October 1937 Quarantine Speech, which called for an international \\"quarantine\\" against the \\"epidemic of world lawlessness.\\" He did not at this point seek sanctions against Japan, but he did begin strategic planning to build long-range submarines that could blockade Japan.Travis Beal Jacobs, \\"Roosevelt's 'Quarantine Speech'\\" Historian 24#4 (1962) pp. 483-502 onlineJohn McVickar Haight, Jr., \\"Franklin D. Roosevelt and a Naval Quarantine of Japan\\" Pacific Historical Review 40#2 (1971) pp. 203-226 online In 1936, Germany remilitarized the Rhineland in defiance of the Versailles Treaty. Without the support of Britain or Italy, France declined to intervene to prevent the remilitarization. In March 1938, Germany peacefully annexed Austria. That same year, Germany demanded the annexation of German-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia. In a last desperate effort to keep the peace, Britain and France agreed to German demands with the September 1938 Munich Agreement. Roosevelt supported Britain and France, and insisted on American neutrality in Europe.Wayne S. Cole, \\"Roosevelt and Munich.\\" Diplomatic History 23.1 (1999): 107-110.Barbara Farnham, \\"Roosevelt and the Munich crisis: Insights from prospect theory.\\" Political Psychology (1992): 205-235. onlineJ.M. Haight Jr, \\"France, the United States, and the Munich crisis.\\" Journal of Modern History 32.4 (1960): 340-358. online In March 1939, Hitler flouted the Munich Agreement by occupying the remaining portions of Czechoslovakia. In response, the British announced their commitment to defending Poland, which many assumed Hitler would attack next. After the Munich Agreement, Roosevelt began to prepare for the imminent outbreak of war. He called for the revision of the Neutrality Act in his 1939 State of the Union Address, but his proposal was defeated in both houses of Congress. Roosevelt ordered a massive increase in aircraft production, with a concentration on long-range bombers, especially the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.Jeffery S. Underwood, The Wings of Democracy: The Influence of Air Power on the Roosevelt Administration, 1933‚Äì1941 (1991). =Relations with France= In the 1930s the diplomatic relations between the United States and France were minimal. The United States did not figure in French plans until 1938. Jean-Baptiste Duroselle, France and the United States: from the beginnings to the present (1978) pp 136-46. The embassies had little business beyond assisting tourists and businessmen, but there was practically no high- level activity. French foreign-policy was very busy indeed with the growth of Nazi Germany after 1933, putting to a severe test the French policy of forming military alliances with Germany's smaller neighbors, such as Czechoslovakia and Poland. In dramatic contrast the United States basked in complete security. President Hoover did set up a world economic conference in spring 1933 to come up with international solutions to the depression, but Roosevelt torpedoed it by rejecting any possible recommendations. And the United States moved into an almost complete isolation from European affairs. Nazi Germany was extremely unpopular across the United States, because of its anti-Semitism its will to conquest its aggression and its dismantling of democratic features to create a totalitarian state. But there was no thought of going to war in Europe. Charles Lindbergh was the hero of the hour, and was a strong spokesman for the notion that a powerful Air Force would always protect the United States, but the Atlantic was too wide for the bombers of the day. A. Scott Berg, Lindbergh (1998) pp 374-89. American land forces were minimal and remained so until 1940. Efforts at innovation in the Army were rejected ‚Äì for example the tank corps that had been active in the First World War was deactivated, and tank officers such as George Patton and Dwight Eisenhower were advised to be quiet regarding their belief in armored force.George F. Hofmann, \\"The Demise of the US Tank Corps and Medium Tank Development Program.\\" Journal of Military History 37.1 (1973): 20-25. online France was outraged by Hitler's repeated rejection of the Versailles Treaty limitations on German armaments. France poured its money into the Maginot Line, a vast defensive system that covered France's border with Germany, but not its border with neutral Belgium. (In 1940 Germany maneuvered around the Maginot line and invaded France through Belgian.) France expanded its alliance system by adding the Soviet Union, and edging closer to Italy and especially to Britain. In 1938 France and Britain sacrificed Czechoslovakia to appease Nazi aggression through the Munich Agreement. Meanwhile in the Spanish Civil War, Germany was demonstrating the superiority of its Air Force, while giving its pilots combat experience. France suddenly became aware of its drastic inferiority in airpower -- Germany had better warplanes, more of them, pilots with combat experience, and much bigger and more efficient factories.Duroselle, France and the United States (1978) pp 136-37. J. N√©r√©, The foreign policy of France from 1914 to 1945 (1975) pp 93-99, 151-72. Paris made an enormous effort to catch up by expanding its military budget, giving priority to aviation, standardizing its models, building new factories, and making overseas purchases. France expected to be powerful in the air by 1941, and in combination with Britain, to have more airpower than Germany by then. Duroselle, France and the Nazi Threat' (2004) pp 374-84. In late 1937 Paris sent to Washington a personal friend of Roosevelt, Senator Baron Amaury de La Grange. He told Roosevelt about the French weaknesses, and urgently asked for help. Roosevelt was never an isolationist, strongly opposed Nazi Germany, and was eager to help France. He also realized that a large French order would greatly speed up the expansion of the American aircraft industry. Roosevelt forced the War Department to secretly sell the most modern American airplanes to France.John McVickar Haight, \\"Roosevelt as Friend of France.\\" Foreign Affairs 44.3 (1966): 518-526. onlineJohn McVickar Haight, Jr., \\"France's Search For American Military Aircraft: Before The Munich Crisis\\" Aerospace Historian (1978) 26#3 pp 141-152. Paris frantically expanded its own aircraft production, but it was too little and too late. France and Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, but there was little action until the following spring. Suddenly a German blitzkrieg overwhelmed Denmark and Norway and trapped French and British forces in Belgium. France was forced to accept German terms and a pro-fascist dictatorship took over in Vichy France. Only 200 of the 555 American aircraft ordered had arrived in France by June 1940, so Roosevelt arranged for the remaining planes sold to the British.Kevin E. Smith, \\"Relations with the British and French,\\" in William D. Pederson, ed., A Companion to Franklin D. Roosevelt (2011), pp 493-516. =World War II begins in Europe= World War II began in September 1939 with Germany's invasion of Poland, as France and Britain declared war in response. Western leaders were stunned when the Soviet Union and Germany split control of Poland; the two powers had reached a non-aggression pact in August 1939, which contained a secret protocol for the partition of Poland. Though few Americans wanted to intervene in the war, an October 1939 Gallup poll showed that over 80 percent of the country favored Britain and France over Germany. Per the terms of the Neutrality Act, Roosevelt recognized a state of war in Europe, imposing an arms embargo on France, Britain, and Germany. Days later, Roosevelt called Congress into a special session to revise the Neutrality Act. Overcoming the opposition of famous aviator Charles Lindbergh and other isolationists, Roosevelt won passage of the Neutrality Act of 1939, which allowed belligerents to purchase aircraft and other combat material from the United States, albeit only on a cash and carry basis. Though the United States would remain officially neutral until December 1941, Roosevelt continued to seek ways to assist Britain and France. During the so-called \\"Phony War,\\" a period of inactivity in Europe following the conclusion of the invasion of Poland, Roosevelt tried to negotiate a peace, but Hitler was uninterested in such a possibility. Japan, meanwhile, grew increasingly assertive in the Pacific, demanding that the French and British colonies close their borders with China. Beginning in September 1939, Roosevelt forged a close personal relationship with Winston Churchill, who became the British prime minister in May 1940. Germany invaded Denmark and Norway in April 1940 and invaded the Low Countries and France in May. As France's situation grew increasingly desperate, Churchill and French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud appealed to Roosevelt for an American entry into the war, but Roosevelt was still unwilling to challenge the isolationist sentiment in the United States. With France on the verge of surrender, Italy also launched an invasion of France. France surrendered on June 22, resulting in the division of France into a German-controlled zone and a partially occupied area known Vichy France. With the fall of France, Britain and its dominions became the lone major force at war with Germany. Roosevelt, who was determined to stay out of the war even if Britain is defeated, considered the shift of public opinion; the fall of Paris led to a rise in isolationist sentiment as observed by the contemporaries,Frederick L. Schuman, ‚ÄúWar, Peace and the Balance of Power,‚Äù The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences, 210, (1940): p 73. though later historiographies attempt to find a decline in this sentiment. In July 1940, 90% of Americans wanted America to stay out of the war.Schuman 1940: p 73. Roosevelt defeated his interventionist opponent in the 1940 presidential elections, Wendell Willkie, with an overwhelming advantage.Ian Kershaw, Fateful Choices: Ten Decisions That Changed the World, 1940-1941, Tel Aviv: Am Oved Publishers, 2009, p 391. Public opinion remained highly isolationist until May 1941, when 80% were against the entry into the war and third of the polled still supported the clear isolationism.Kershaw 2009: p 390. Radio coverage of the Battle of Britain, an aerial campaign in which Germany attempted to air superiority and bombed British targets, further galvanized American public opinion behind Britain but definitely short of war.Kershaw 2009: p 391. Overcoming the opposition of much of the military establishment, who doubted Britain's ability to remain in the war against Germany, Roosevelt pursued policies designed to maximize arms transfers to Britain and overcoming the opposition of much of the government, Roosevelt rejected the convoy escort across the Atlantic for one more year.David Reynolds, From World War to Cold War: Churchill, Roosevelt and the International History of the 1940s, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006, p 54. In July 1940, Roosevelt appointed two interventionist Republican leaders, Henry L. Stimson and Frank Knox, as Secretaries of War and the Navy, respectively. Both parties gave support to his plans for a rapid build-up the American military,Burns (1956), p. 420. but Roosevelt himself sided with the isolationists in not getting the nation into a war with Germany. Consequently, both Stimson and Knox the following year were disappointed,Arthur P. Whitaker, The Western Hemisphere Idea: Its Rise and Decline, New York: Cornell University Press, 1954, p 160, puzzled,Erik Larrabee, Commander in Chief: FDR, His Lieutenants and Their War, New York: Harper & Row, 1987, p 40 and \\"shocked\\"Kershaw 2009: p 255 by FDR‚Äôs isolationist line, or ‚Äúfailure of leadership,‚Äù as they called it.Kershaw 2009: p 254. The military build-up and the British purchase of armaments had a beneficial effect on the economy, and the unemployment rate fell to 14.6 percent in late 1940. On September 2, 1940, Roosevelt defied the spirit of the Neutrality Acts in reaching the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. In exchange for the use of British military bases in the Caribbean Islands, the U.S. transferred 50 old World War I American destroyers, which were to be used to defend against German submarines.Richard M. Pious, \\"The Historical Presidency: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Destroyer Deal: Normalizing Prerogative Power.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 42#1 (2012): 190-204. The destroyers themselves held relatively little military importance, but the deal represented a symbolic American commitment to Britain. Later in September 1940, with the backing of both major party presidential candidates, Congress authorized the nation's first ever peacetime draft. Hitler and Mussolini responded to the Destroyers for Bases Agreement by joining with Japan in the Tripartite Pact, and the three countries became known as the Axis powers. The Tripartite Act was specifically designed to intimidate the United States into remaining neutral in the Sino-Japanese War and the war in Europe. As Roosevelt took a firmer stance against the Axis Powers, American isolationists like Lindbergh and America First vehemently attacked the president as an irresponsible warmonger. In turn they were denounced as anti-Semitic dupes of the Nazis. Reviewer Richard S. Faulkner paraphrases Lynne Olson in arguing that, \\"Lindbergh was far from the simple anti-Semite and pro-Nazi dupe that the Roosevelt administration and pro-intervention press often portrayed him to be, but was rather a man whose technical and clinical mind had him convinced that Britain could not win the war and America‚Äôs lack of military preparedness meant that intervention was immoral, illogical, and suicidal.\\"Richard S. Faulkner review of Lynne Olson, Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh & America's Fight Over World War II 1939‚Äì1941 (2013) in Military Review (January, 2014) 94#1.  Prelude to war: 1941  The geopolitical disposition of Europe in 1941. The grey area represents Nazi Germany, its allies, and countries under its firm control. After his reelection in 1940 the world war dominated FDR's attention, with far more time devoted to world affairs than ever before. Domestic politics and relations with Congress were largely shaped by his efforts to achieve total mobilization of the nation's economic, financial, and institutional resources for the war effort. Even relationships with Latin America and Canada were structured by wartime demands. Roosevelt maintained tight personal control of all major diplomatic and military decisions, working closely with his generals and admirals, the war and Navy departments, Churchill and the British, and even with the Soviet Union. His key advisors on diplomacy were Harry Hopkins (who was based in the White House), Sumner Welles (based in the State Department), and Henry Morgenthau Jr. at Treasury. In military affairs FDR worked most closely with Secretary Henry L. Stimson at the War Department, Army Chief of Staff George Marshall, and Admiral William D. Leahy.Winston Groom, The Allies: Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, and the Unlikely Alliance That Won World War II (2018)Joseph E. Persico, Roosevelt's Centurions: FDR and the Commanders He Led to Victory in World War II (2013).Eric Larrabee, Commander in Chief: Franklin Delano Roosevelt, His Lieutenants, and Their War (1987) = Intelligence and espionage = the United States lacked an intelligence agency, and intelligence services of the Army Navy and State Department did not cooperate with one another. This left an opening for the British to supply Roosevelt with fresh documents indicating the Germans were planning to build up their power in Latin America. Roosevelt believed the falsehoods he was fed, and made defensive Latin America against Germany a high priority.Christopher Andrew, For the President's Eyes Only: Secret Intelligence and the American Presidency from Washington to Bush (1995) pp 92, 102-3.Rhodri Jeffreys‚ÄêJones, \\"The role of British intelligence in the mythologies underpinning the OSS and early CIA.\\" Intelligence and National Security 15.2 (2000): 5-19. Roosevelt also quietly read a British communist newsletter on world events. During the war, Roosevelt set up a new agency the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) headed by an old personal friend William J. Donovan.Douglas Waller, Wild Bill Donovan: The Spymaster Who Created the OSS and Modern American Espionage (2012) pp 69-80. OSS engaged in numerous espionage operations and sabotage efforts against Germany, and played a minor role in support of the Chinese theater. It was shut down at the end of the war, and partly reassembled later in the Central Intelligence Agency.Richard Harris Smith, OSS: The Secret History Of America's First Central Intelligence Agency (1972) Roosevelt appointed one of his original brain trusters's Adolph A. Berle to a senior position in the State Department coordinating intelligence. He relied on daily briefings from Army and Navy intelligence, and also paid attention to reports from the Office of War Information and from J Edgar Hoover's FBI. Meanwhile, none of his agencies realize the scope of Soviet spying during the war, including even the OSS. All the different agencies were feuding with each other, demonstrating a weakness in Roosevelt's decision to be his own coordinator of information. Joseph E. Persico, Roosevelt's Secret War: FDR and World War to Espionage (2001) pp 171-75, 293 =Early 1941= After his victory over Wendell Willkie in the 1940 election, Roosevelt embarked on a public campaign to win congressional support for aid to the British. In December 1940, Roosevelt received a letter from Churchill asking the U.S. to repeal the cash and carry provision of the Neutrality Act. With British forces committed to defending against Germany, Churchill asked for the United States to provide loans and shipping for American goods. In response, Roosevelt delivered a speech in which he called for the United States to serve as the \\"Arsenal of Democracy,\\" supplying aid to those resisting Germany and other aggressors. He stated, \\"if Great Britain goes down, the Axis Powers will control the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia, and the high seas‚Äìand they will be in a position to bring enormous military and naval resources against this hemisphere.\\" In his January 1941 Four Freedoms speech, Roosevelt laid out the case for an American defense of basic rights throughout the world. In that same speech, Roosevelt asked Congress to approve a Lend-Lease program designed to provide military aid to Britain. With the backing of Willkie, the Lend- Lease bill passed by large majorities in both houses of Congress, with most of the opposition coming from Midwestern Republicans. Isolationists did, however, prevent the U.S. from providing naval escorts to merchant ships heading to Britain. Roosevelt also requested, and Congress, granted, a major boost in military expenditures. With this boost in spending, the unemployment rate dropped below ten percent for the first time in over a decade. To oversee mobilization efforts, Roosevelt created the Office of Production Management, the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply, and the Supply Priorities and Allocation Board. In late 1940, Admiral Stark had sent Roosevelt the Plan Dog memo, which set forth four strategic war plans for fighting an anticipated two-front war against Japan and Germany. Of the four strategies, Stark advocated for the so-called \\"Plan Dog,\\" which contemplated a Europe first strategy and the avoidance of conflict with Japan for as long as possible. A key part of this strategy was to ensure that Britain remained in the fight against Germany until the United States, potentially with the aid of other countries, could launch a land offensive into Europe. Roosevelt did not publicly commit to Plan Dog, but it motivated him to launch talks between American and British military staff, codenamed \\"ABC‚Äì1.\\" In early 1941, American and British military planners jointly agreed to pursue a Europe first strategy. In July 1941, Roosevelt ordered Secretary of War Stimson to begin planning for total American military involvement. The resulting \\"Victory Program\\" provided the army's estimates of the mobilization of manpower, industry, and logistics necessary to defeat Germany and Japan. The program planned to dramatically increase aid to the Allied nations and to prepare a force of ten million men in arms, half of whom would be ready for deployment abroad in 1943. When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Roosevelt agreed to extend Lend-Lease to the Soviets. Thus, Roosevelt had committed the U.S. to the Allied side with a policy of \\"all aid short of war.\\" Some Americans were reluctant to aid the Soviet Union, but Roosevelt believed that the Soviets would be indispensable in the defeat of Germany. Execution of the aid fell victim to foot dragging in the administration, so FDR appointed a special assistant, Wayne Coy, to expedite matters. =Late 1941= In February 1941, Hitler refocused the war against Britain from air operations to naval operations, specifically U-boat (German submarine) raids against convoys headed to Britain. In response to these attacks, Churchill requested that the United States provide convoy escorts, but Roosevelt was still reluctant to challenge anti-war sentiment. In May, German submarines sank the SS Robin Moor, an American freighter, but Roosevelt declined to use the incident as a pretext to increase the navy's role in the Atlantic. Meanwhile, the Axis Powers experienced success in their campaigns against the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Greece, and British forces in North Africa. In August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill conducted a highly secret meeting in Argentia, Newfoundland. This meeting Announced to the world the Atlantic Charter, which conceptually outlined global wartime and postwar goals. Each leader pledged to support democracy, free trade, and principles of non-aggression. Whether or not self-determination applied to the British colonies became a highly controversial debate.Theodore A. Wilson, The First Summit: Roosevelt and Churchill at Placentia Bay, 1941 (1991). Naval confrontations escalated in the North Atlantic, as German U-boats tried to sink British ships while avoiding contact with the U.S. Navy. American destroyers started hunting and tracking German submarines, passing information to the British Royal Navy, which tried to sink them. Roosevelt insisted that American actions were defensive, as isolationists denounced a deceitful plan to go to war.Douglas M. Norton, \\"The Open Secret: The US Navy in the Battle of the Atlantic April-December 1941.\\" Naval War College Review (1974) 26#4: 63-83. OnlineDan Reiter, \\"Democracy, deception, and entry into war.\\" Security Studies 21.4 (2012): 594-623. On 4 September 1941 an American destroyer the USS Greer (DD-145), which was carrying mail and passengers to Iceland, tracked a German submarine but did not fire on it. The German u-boat U-652 fired two torpedoes at the Greer, which evaded them. Neither worship was damaged. In response, Roosevelt announced a new policy in which the U.S. would attack German or Italian ships that entered U.S. naval zones. This \\"shoot on sight\\" policy effectively declared naval war on Germany and was favored by Americans by a margin of 2-to-1. However, this episode did not escalate into all-out war, because both Hitler and Roosevelt were very cautious. Hitler needed to devote all his military resources to his invasion of the Soviet Union, and Roosevelt wanted to build up public support for an aggressive policy to control the North Atlantic. Roosevelt Sent the military to establish American bases in Greenland and Iceland. Seeking to head off a possible German invasion German influence, the Roosevelt administration increased military, commercial, and cultural engagement with Latin America.Gerald K. Haines, \\"Under the Eagle's Wing: The Franklin Roosevelt Administration Forges an American Hemisphere.\\" Diplomatic History 1.4 (1977): 373-388. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7709.1977.tb00248 In October 1941, the USS Kearny, along with other ships, engaged a number of U-boats south of Iceland; the Kearny took fire and lost eleven crewmen. Following the attack, Congress amended the Neutrality Act to allow American merchant ships to transport war supplies to Britain, effectively repealing the last provision of the cash and carry policy. However, neither the Kearny incident nor an attack on the USS Reuben James' changed public opinion as much as Roosevelt hoped they might. =War threatens in the Pacific= By 1940, Japan had conquered much of the Chinese coast and major river valleys but had been unable to defeat either the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek or the Communist forces under Mao Zedong. Though Japan's government was nominally led by the civilian government of Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoye, Minister of War Hideki Tojo and other military leaders held immense power in the Japanese governmental system. At Tojo's insistence, Japan moved to take control of lightly-defended European colonies in Southeast Asia, which provided important resources as well as a conduit of supply to Chinese forces. When Japan occupied northern French Indochina in late 1940, Roosevelt authorized increased aid to the Republic of China, a policy that won widespread popular support. He also implemented a partial embargo on Japan, preventing the export of iron and steel. Over the next year, the Roosevelt administration debated imposing an embargo on oil, the key American export to Japan. Though some in the administration wanted to do everything possible to prevent Japanese expansion, Secretary of State Hull feared that cutting off trade would encourage the Japanese to meet its needs for natural resources through the conquest of the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, British Burma, or the Philippines. With Roosevelt's attention focused on Europe, Hull took the lead in setting Asian policy and negotiating with Japan. Beginning in March 1941, Hull and Japanese ambassador Kichisabur≈ç Nomura sought to reach an accommodation between their respective governments. As the U.S. was not willing to accept the Japanese occupation of China, and Japan was not willing to withdraw from that country, the two positions irreconcilable After Germany launched its invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Japanese decided not to avoid war in Siberia--its first priority had to be oil. In July, Japan took control of southern French Indochina, which provided a potential staging ground for an attack on British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, with their rich oil fields. In response, the U.S. cut off the sale of oil to Japan, which thus lost more than 95 percent of its oil supply. Following the American embargo, Japanese leaders turned their attention to the conquest of the Dutch East Indies, which had a large supply of oil. In order to consolidate control of the Dutch East Indies, Japanese military planners believed that they needed to capture the Philippines, take control of the British base at Singapore, and defeat the United States Pacific Fleet, which was stationed at the Hawaiian naval base at Pearl Harbor. No Japanese leader saw the total defeat of the United States as a feasible outcome, but many hoped that a decisive naval victory would convince the Americans to leave control of the Pacific to Japan. Prime Minister Konoye sought a summit with Roosevelt in order to avoid war, but the continued U.S. insistence on the Japanese withdrawal from China scuttled those plans. Tojo succeeded Konoye as prime minister in October, and the Japanese began preparations for an attack on the United States. In November, Nomura made a final offer, asking for reopened trade and acceptance of the Japanese campaign in China in return for Japan's pledge not to attack Southeast Asia. In large part because the U.S. feared that Japan would attack the Soviet Union after conquering China, Roosevelt declined the offer, and negotiations collapsed on November 26. =Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941= On the morning of December 7, 1941, the Japanese struck the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor with a surprise attack, knocking out the main American battleship fleet and killing 2,403 American servicemen and civilians. The great majority of scholars have rejected a variety of conspiracy theories that Washington knew in advance. The Japanese had kept their secrets closely guarded, and while senior American officials were aware that war was imminent, they did not expect an attack on Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt had anticipated that the first attack would take place in the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, or the Philippines. Map of Japanese military advances, until mid-1942 After Pearl Harbor, antiwar sentiment in the United States evaporated overnight. For the first time since the early 19th century, foreign policy became the top priority for the American public. Roosevelt called for war in his famous \\"Infamy Speech\\" to Congress, in which he said: \\"Yesterday, December 7, 1941 ‚Äî a date which will live in infamy ‚Äî the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.\\" On December 8, Congress voted almost unanimously to declare war against Japan. On December 11, 1941, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, which responded in kind. Roosevelt portrayed the war as a crusade against the aggressive dictatorships that threatened peace and democracy throughout the world. He and his military advisers implemented a war strategy with the objectives of halting the German advances in the Soviet Union and in North Africa; launching an invasion of western Europe with the aim of crushing Nazi Germany between two fronts; and saving China and defeating Japan. Public opinion, however, gave priority to the destruction of Japan, so American forces were sent chiefly to the Pacific in 1942. Japan launched an aerial attack on American forces in the Philippines just hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. By the end of the month, the Japanese had launched an invasion of the Philippines. General Douglas MacArthur led American resistance in the Philippines until March 1942, when Roosevelt ordered him to evacuate to Australia. American forces on the Philippines surrendered in May 1942, leaving Japan with approximately ten thousand American prisoners. While it was subduing the Philippines, Japan also conquered Thailand, British Malaya, Singapore, much of Burma, and the Dutch East Indies. In his role as the leader of the United States before and during World War II, Roosevelt tried to avoid repeating what he saw as Woodrow Wilson's mistakes in World War I. He often made exactly the opposite decision. Wilson called for neutrality in thought and deed, while Roosevelt made it clear his administration strongly favored Britain and China. Unlike the loans in World War I, the United States made large-scale grants of military and economic aid to the Allies through Lend- Lease, with little expectation of repayment. Wilson did not greatly expand war production before the declaration of war; Roosevelt did. Wilson waited for the declaration to begin a draft; Roosevelt started one in 1940. Wilson never made the United States an official ally but Roosevelt did. Wilson never met with the top Allied leaders but Roosevelt did. Wilson proclaimed independent policy, as seen in the 14 Points, while Roosevelt sought a collaborative policy with the Allies. In 1917, the United States declared war on Germany; in 1941, Roosevelt waited until the enemy attacked at Pearl Harbor. Wilson refused to collaborate with the Republicans; Roosevelt named leading Republicans to head the War Department and the Navy Department. Wilson let General George Pershing make the major military decisions; Roosevelt made the major decisions in his war including the \\"Europe first\\" strategy. He rejected the idea of an armistice and demanded unconditional surrender. Roosevelt often mentioned his role as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in the Wilson administration, but added that he had profited more from Wilson's errors than from his successes.Robert Dallek, Franklin D. Roosevelt and American foreign policy, 1932‚Äì1945 (1995) pp 232, 319, 373 Robert E. Sherwood argues: :Roosevelt could never forget Wilson's mistakes....there was no motivating force in all of Roosevelt's wartime political policy stronger than the determination to prevent repetition of the same mistakes.Robert E. Sherwood, Roosevelt and Hopkins, an Intimate History (1948) p. 227. Alliances, economic warfare, and other wartime issues =Four Policemen= In late December 1941 Churchill and Roosevelt met at the Arcadia Conference, which established a joint strategy between the U.S. and Britain. Both agreed on a Europe first strategy that would prioritize the defeat of Germany before Japan. With British forces focused on the war in Europe, and with the Soviet Union not at war with Japan, the United States would take the lead in the Pacific War despite its own focus on Germany. The U.S. and Britain established the Combined Chiefs of Staff to coordinate military policy and the Combined Munitions Assignments Board to coordinate the allocation of supplies. An agreement was also reached to establish a centralized command in the Pacific theater called ABDA, named for the American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces in the theater. On January 1, 1942, the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and twenty-two other countries issued the Declaration by United Nations, in which each nation pledged to defeat the Axis powers. These countries opposed to the Axis would be known as the Allied Powers. Roosevelt coined the term \\"Four Policemen\\" to refer the \\"Big Four\\" Allied powers of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and China. Roosevelt, Churchill, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, and Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek cooperated informally on a plan in which American and British troops concentrated in the West; Soviet troops fought on the Eastern front; and Chinese, British and American troops fought in Asia and the Pacific. The Allies formulated strategy in a series of high-profile conferences as well as contact through diplomatic and military channels. Roosevelt had a close relationship with Churchill, but he and his advisers quickly lost respect for Chiang's government, viewing it as hopelessly corrupt. General Joseph Stilwell, who was assigned to lead U.S. forces in the China Burma India Theater, came to believe that Chiang was more concerned with defeating Mao's Communists than with defeating the Japanese. U.S. and Soviet leaders distrusted each other throughout the war, and relations further suffered after 1943 as both sides supported sympathetic governments in liberated territories. =Roosevelt opposes European colonies in Asia= Roosevelt was strongly committed to terminating European colonialism in Asia. He tried to pressure Churchill regarding independence of India, but Churchill fought back vociferously, forcing Roosevelt to drop that kind of attack. Roosevelt then turned to French Indochina. He wanted to put it under an international trusteeship. He wanted the United States to work closely with China to become the policeman for the region and stabilize it; the U.S. would provide suitable financing. The scheme was directly contrary to the Free French, for de Gaulle had a grand vision of the French overseas empire as the base for his return to defeat Vichy France. Roosevelt could not abide de Gaulle, but Winston Churchill realized that Britain needed French help to reestablish its position in Europe after the war. He and the British foreign office decided to work closely with de Gaulle to achieve that goal, and therefore they had to frustrated Roosevelt's decolonization scheme. In doing so, they had considerable support from like-minded American officials. The basic weakness of Roosevelt's scheme was its dependence on Chiang Kai-shek the ruler of China. Chiang's regime virtually collapsed under Japanese pressures in 1944, and Japan overran the American airbases that were built to attack Japan. The Pentagon's plans to use China as a base to destroy Japan collapsed, so the U.S. Air Force turned its attention to attacking Japan with very long- range B-29 bombers based in the Pacific. The American military no longer needed China or Southeast Asia. China clearly was too weak to be a policeman. With the defeat of Japan, Britain took over Southeast Asia and returned Indochina to France. Roosevelt realized his trusteeship plan was dead, and accepted the British-French actions as necessary to stabilize Southeast Asia. Walter LaFeber, \\"Roosevelt, Churchill, and Indochina: 1942-45\\" American Historical Review (1975) 80#5 pp 1277-1295. online =Other allies= By the end of the war, several states, including all of Latin America, had joined the Allies. Roosevelt's appointment of young Nelson Rockefeller to head the new, well-funded Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs provided energetic leadership.Cary Reich, The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller: Worlds to Conquer, 1908‚Äì1958 (1996) pp 260-373. Under Rockefeller's leadership, the U.S. spent millions on radio broadcasts, motion pictures, and other anti-fascist propaganda. American advertising techniques generated a push back in Mexico, especially, where well-informed locals resisted heavy-handed American influence.Kornel Chang, \\"Muted reception: US propaganda and the construction of Mexican popular opinion during the Second World War.\\" Diplomatic History 38.3 (2013): 569-598. Nevertheless, Mexico was a valuable ally in the war. A deal was reached whereby 250,000 Mexican citizens living in the United States served in the American forces; over 1000 were killed in combat. In addition to propaganda, large sums were allocated for economic support and development. On the whole the Roosevelt policy in Latin America was a political success, except in Argentina, which tolerated German influence, and refused to follow Washington's lead until the war was practically over.Randall B. Woods, \\"Hull and Argentina: Wilsonian Diplomacy in the Age of Roosevelt\\" Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs 16#3 (1974) pp. 350-371 onlineReich, pp 270-75, 305-17. Outside of Latin America, the U.S. paid particularly close attention to its oil-rich allies in the Middle East, marking the start of sustained American engagement in the region. =Lend Lease and economic warfare= The main American role in the war, beyond the military mission itself, was financing the war and providing large quantities of munitions and civilian goods. Lend lease, as passed by Congress in 1941, was a declaration of economic warfare, and that economic warfare continued after the attack on Pearl Harbor.Warren F. Kimball, Forged War: Roosevelt, Churchill and the Second World War (1997), p 74. Roosevelt believed that the financing of World War I through loans to the Allies, with the demand for repayment after the war, had been a mistake. He set up the Lend Lease system as a war program, financed through the military budget. As soon as the war with Japan ended it was terminated.William Hardy McNeil, America, Britain and Russia: Their cooperation and conflict 1941-1946 (1953) pp 118-50, 772-86. The president chose the leadership‚ÄîHopkins and Edward Stettinius Jr. played major roles‚Äîand exercised close oversight and control.Burns, 2:248. One problem that bedeviled the program in 1942 was the strictly limited supply of munitions that had to be divided between Lend Lease and American forces. Roosevelt insisted to the military that Russia was to get all the supplies he had promised it.Maurice Matlof and Edwin M. Snell, [http://tothosewhoserved.org/usa/wd/usawd03/chapter09.html Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare 1941-1942 (1953) pp 205-10. Lend-lease aid to the Soviet Union declined somewhat in mid-1942 after the United States began to prepare for military operations in North Africa. The U.S. spent about $40 billion on Lend Lease aid to the British Empire, the Soviet Union, France, China, and some smaller countries. That amounted to about 11% of the cost of the war to the U.S. It received back about $7.8 billion in goods and services provided by the recipients to the United States, especially the cost of food and rent for American installations abroad.R.G.D. Allen, \\"Mutual Aid between the U.S. and the British Empire, 1941‚Äì5\\", in Journal of the Royal Statistical Society no. 109 #3, 1946. pp 243‚Äì77 in JSTOR Britain received $30 billion, Russia received $10.7 billion, and all other countries $2.9 billion.Allen (1946) p 250. When the question of repayment arose, Roosevelt insisted the United States did not want a postwar debt problem of the sort that had troubled relations after the first world war. The recipients provided bases and supplies to American forces on their own soil; this was referred informally as \\"Reverse Lend Lease,\\" and the combined total of this aid came to approximately $7.8 billion overall.Allen (1946) p 258, 260; McNeill p 781. In the end, none of the Allied Powers paid for the goods received during the war, although they did pay for goods in transit that were received after the program ended. Roosevelt told Congress in June 1942:McNeil, America, Britain and Russia (1953) pp 137-50. : The real costs of the war cannot be measured, nor compared, nor paid for in money. They must and are being met in blood and toil... If each country devotes roughly the same fraction of its national production to the war, then the financial burden of war is distributed equally among the United Nations in accordance with their ability to pay. A major issue in the economic war was the transportation of supplies. After Germany declared war on the United States, Hitler removed all restrictions on the German submarine fleet. German submarines ravaged Allied shipping in the Atlantic, with many of the attacks taking place within ten miles of the East Coast of the United States in early 1942. The U.S. Navy faced difficulties in simultaneously protecting Atlantic shipping while also prosecuting the war against Japan, and over one millions tons of Allied shipping was lost in 1942. The cracking of the German Enigma code, along with the construction and deployment of American naval escorts and maritime patrol aircraft helped give the Allied Powers the upper hand in the Battle of the Atlantic after 1942. After the Allies sank dozens of U-boats early 1943, most German submarines were withdrawn from the North Atlantic. The United States began a strategic bombing campaign against Axis forces in Europe in mid-1942. Attacks initially targeted locations in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands; U.S. bombers launched their first attack against a target in Germany in January 1943. In an attempt to destroy Germany's industrial capacity, Allied bombers struck targets such as oil refineries and ball- bearing factories. After taking heavy losses in Operation Tidal Wave and the Second Raid on Schweinfurt, the U.S. significantly scaled back the strategic bombing of Germany. General Carl Andrew Spaatz re-directed U.S. strategic bombing efforts to focus on the German aircraft production facilities, and the Allies enjoyed air superiority in Europe after February 1944. Allied strategic bombing escalated in late 1944, with an emphasis placed on Germany's transportation infrastructure and oil resources. With the goal of forcing a quick German surrender, in 1945 the Allies launched attacks on Berlin and Dresden that killed tens of thousands of civilians. =Reaction to the Holocaust= Public opinion in the 1930s was very hostile to new immigration. Compounded by anti-Semitism,Susan Welch, \\"American opinion toward Jews during the Nazi era,\\" Social Science Quarterly 95.3 (2014): 615-635. Online and the reluctance of Jewish newspapers and film producers to become involved, very little was done to rescue European Jews threatened by the Nazis.Richard Breitman and Allan J. Lichtman, FDR and the Jews (Harvard UP, 2013) After Kristallnacht in 1938, Roosevelt helped expedite Jewish immigration from Germany and allowed Austrian and German citizens already in the United States to stay indefinitely. He was prevented from accepting more Jewish immigrants by the prevalence of nativism and antisemitism among voters and members of Congress, resistance in the American Jewish community to the acceptance of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, and the restrictive Immigration Act of 1924. The Immigration Act of 1924 allowed only 150,000 immigrants to the United States per year and set firm quotas for each country, and in midst of the Great Depression there was little popular support for revisions to the law that would allow for a more liberal immigration policy. In 1938 Roosevelt pushed the limits of his executive authority to allow 50,000 German Jews, to escape from Europe or remain in the United States past their visa expiration. Roosevelt's State Department, however, was very hostile to the numerous proposals made it to rescue more Jews by bringing them to the United States.See David S. Wyman, The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust, 1941-1945 (1984) Germany in January 1942 implemented the \\"Final Solution\\"‚Äìthe extermination of all Jews. American officials learned of the scale of the Nazi extermination campaign in the following months. Against the objections of his State Department, Roosevelt convinced the other Allied leaders to jointly issue the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations, which condemned the ongoing Holocaust and promised to try its perpetrators as war criminals. In January 1944, Roosevelt established the War Refugee Board to aid Jews and other victims of Axis atrocities. Aside from these actions, Roosevelt believed that the best way to help the persecuted populations of Europe was to win the war as quickly as possible. Top military leaders and War Department leaders rejected any campaign to bomb the extermination camps or the rail lines leading to the camps, fearing it would be a diversion from the war effort. According to biographer Jean Edward Smith, there is no evidence that anyone ever proposed such a campaign to Roosevelt himself. In sum, Roosevelt took significant but limited action regarding the persecution in Germany, the refugee crisis in the 1930s, and the systematic killing of six million Jews in gas chambers after 1941. Public and elite opinion, including the Jewish-American leadership, generated little pressure to take action. Roosevelt's legacy remains highly controversial among historians and the general public.United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. ‚ÄúFranklin Delano Roosevelt.‚Äù Holocaust Encyclopedia online Richard Breitman and Allan J. Lichtman state:, \\"This ongoing quarrel is unforgiving, passionate, and politically charged.\\" They conclude that Roosevelt: :did more for the Jews than any other world figure, even if his efforts seem deficient in retrospect. He was a far better president for Jews than any of his political adversaries would have been. Roosevelt defied most Republican opponents and some isolationist Democrats to lead political and military opposition to Nazi Germany's plan for expansion and world domination. Course of the war The two alliances of World War II, with the Axis Powers in blue and the Allied Powers in green =Mediterranean and European theater= The Soviets urged an Anglo-American invasion of France in order to divert German troops and munitions from the Eastern front. Churchill in particular was reluctant to commit troops in Europe in 1942, and strongly favored launching a campaign designed to expel the Axis Powers from North Africa and to consolidate Allied power in the Mediterranean. General Marshall and Admiral King opposed the decision to prioritize North Africa, which they saw as relatively unimportant to the overall war. Roosevelt overrode their objections, as he wanted the U.S. to commit ground forces in the European theater, in 1942, and with British cooperation. The Allies invaded French North Africa in November 1942, securing the quick surrender of local Vichy French forces. That surrender was arranged through a deal between General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme commander of the Allied invasion of North Africa, and Vichy Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan. The cooperation with Darlan allowed the Allies to quickly gain control of much of North Africa, but it also alienated Free French leader Charles de Gaulle and other opponents of the Vichy regime. Darlan was assassinated in December 1942, while Vichy France broke relations with the United States and requested that German forces prevent the Allies from gaining control of French Tunisia. The experience with de Gaulle, Darlan, and another French leader, Henri Giraud, convinced Roosevelt of the necessity to avoid becoming closely associated with any French faction for the remainder of the war. In the Tunisian Campaign, Eisenhower initially faced great difficulties in leading his inexperienced force to success, but Allied forces eventually gained the upper hand. 250,000 Axis soldiers surrendered in May 1943, bringing an end to the North African Campaign. At the January 1943 Casablanca Conference, the U.S. and Britain agreed to defeat Axis forces in North Africa and then launch an invasion of Sicily after the North African campaign, with an attack on France to follow in 1944. At the conference, Roosevelt also announced that he would only accept the unconditional surrender of Germany, Japan, and Italy. The demand for unconditional surrender was calculated to reassure the Soviets, who were still insisting on an immediate attack on German-occupied France, that the United States would not seek a negotiated peace with Germany. In February 1943, the Soviet Union turned the tide on the eastern front by winning a decisive victory at the Battle of Stalingrad. The Allies launched an invasion of Sicily in July 1943, capturing the island by the end of the following month. During the campaign in Sicily, King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy arrested Mussolini and replaced him with Pietro Badoglio, who secretly negotiated a surrender with the Allies. Despite his earlier insistence on unconditional surrender, Roosevelt accepted armistice terms that allowed Badoglio to remain in power. Germany quickly restored Mussolini to power and set up a puppet state in northern Italy. The Allied invasion of mainland Italy commenced in September 1943, but the Italian Campaign moved slowly until 1945. Roosevelt consented to the campaign only on the condition that the British commit to an invasion of France in mid-1944, and the Allied Powers began to build up a force for that operation, diverting soldiers from the Italian Campaign. To command the invasion of France, Roosevelt passed over Marshall and in favor of General Eisenhower. Roosevelt had originally wanted to appoint Marshall to the command, but top military leaders argued that Marshall was indispensable in his role in Washington. While building up forces in Britain, the Allied Powers engaged in Operation Bodyguard, an elaborate campaign designed to mask where the Allies would land in Northwestern Europe. Eisenhower launched Operation Overlord, a landing in the Northern French region of Normandy, on June 6, 1944. Supported by 12,000 aircraft that provided complete control of the air, and the largest naval force ever assembled, the Allies successfully established a beachhead in Normandy and then advanced further into France. Though reluctant to back an unelected government, Roosevelt recognized Charles de Gaulle's Provisional Government of the French Republic as the de facto government of France in July 1944. After the Battle of the Falaise Pocket, the Allies pushed Axis forces back towards Germany, capturing Paris in August 1944. That same month, the Allies launched Operation Dragoon, an invasion of Southern France. Facing logistical issues, Allied forces attempted to secure the Belgian port of Antwerp before moving on Germany's Ruhr region, but the failure of Operation Market Garden delayed the Allied invasion of Germany. In late 1944, Hitler began to amass forces for a major offensive designed to convince the United States and Britain to seek a negotiated peace. A surprise German attack in December 1944 marked the start of the Battle of the Bulge, but the Allies were able to beat back the attack in the following weeks. The Allies advanced across the Rhine River in March 1945, and took control of the Ruhr and the Saarland, another key industrial region. By April 1945, Nazi resistance was crumbling in the face of advances by both the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. =Pacific theater= After sweeping across Maritime Southeast Asia in the months following Pearl Harbor, Japan looked to further expand its territory, taking control of the Solomon Islands and parts of New Guinea. In May 1942, American and Australian forces defeated the Japanese in the Battle of the Coral Sea, prompting a Japanese land campaign across the island of New Guinea. Seeking to seize control of a strategically-placed island and destroy the U.S. fleet in the Pacific, Japan also launched an attack on the American-held Midway Atoll. With the assistance of the Magic cryptanalysis project, Admiral Chester Nimitz led an American force that defeated the Japanese navy at the Battle of Midway. The Battle of Midway resulted in the Japanese fleet's loss of four crucial aircraft carriers, and the battle marked a major reversal of fortune in the Pacific War. In August 1942, the United States launched an invasion of the Japanese-held South Pacific island of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands; Japanese and American forces contested control of Guadalcanal until February 1943. After the Battle of Guadalcanal, the U.S. adopted an island hopping strategy in order to avoid entrenched Japanese garrisons. By early 1944, Allied forces had established control over much of New Guinea and had landed on the adjacent island of New Britain. While the campaign in the Southwest Pacific continued, U.S. forces launched an offensive in the Central Pacific, beginning with the November 1943 Battle of Tarawa. The U.S. next captured Japanese positions in the Marshall Islands and the Caroline Islands. In June 1944, the U.S. launched an attack on Saipan, in the Mariana Islands, gaining control of the island in early July at the cost of fourteen thousand casualties. As the Battle of Saipan continued, the U.S. won a major naval victory in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, sinking three Japanese aircraft carriers. In July 1944, Roosevelt met with Nimitz and MacArthur, where he authorized the continuation of the campaigns in the Southwest Pacific and the Central Pacific. MacArthur's force would continue its advance towards the Philippines, while the Central Pacific campaign would work its way towards Japan. The U.S. landed on the Philippine island of Leyte in October 1944, provoking a Japanese naval response, as the Philippine Islands maintained a critical position on the Japanese oil supply route from the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese navy was decimated in the resulting Battle of Leyte Gulf, which is sometimes claimed to be the \\"largest naval battle in history.\\" MacArthur's forces secured control of Leyte in December and had largely re-taken control of the Philippines by March 1945. The U.S. began launching strategic bombing raids on Japan from the Mariana Islands in November 1944, but Japan still controlled several islands that provided defense for the Japanese archipelago. In February 1945, the U.S. launched an invasion of the well-defended island of Iwo Jima, taking control of that island the following month. On April 1, the U.S. landed on Okinawa Island, the largest of the Ryukyu Islands. The Japanese allowed the Americans to land on the island before launching a fierce attack that included kamikaze suicide attacks by Japanese aircraft. Japanese forces on Okinawa held out until June 1945; U.S. forces suffered over 60,000 casualties during the operation. Post-war planning Churchill, FDR, and Stalin at Yalta, two months before Roosevelt's death In late 1943, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin agreed to meet to discuss strategy and post-war plans at the Tehran Conference, which marked Roosevelt's first face-to-face meeting with Stalin. At the conference, Britain and the United States committed to opening a second front against Germany in 1944, while Stalin committed to entering the war against Japan at an unspecified date. Roosevelt also privately indicated acceptance of Soviet control of the Baltic states and Soviet plans to shift Poland's borders to the west. Stalin, meanwhile, committed to joining the war against Japan after the defeat of Germany. Post-war plans increasingly came to the fore as the Allies won several major victories in 1944. The wartime economic boom and the experience of the Great Depression convinced many Americans of the need to lower trade barriers. Lend-Lease agreements included provisions for eliminating tariffs, and the U.S. especially desired the dismantlement of the British Imperial Preference system. At the Bretton Woods Conference, the Allies agreed to the creation of the International Monetary Fund, which would provide for currency stabilization, and the World Bank, which would fund post-war rebuilding. Taking up the Wilsonian mantle, Roosevelt also pushed for the establishment of the United Nations, a permanent intergovernmental organization that would succeed the League of Nations. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met for a second time at the February 1945 Yalta Conference. With the end of the war in Europe approaching, Roosevelt's primary focus was on convincing Stalin to enter the war against Japan; the Joint Chiefs had estimated that an American invasion of Japan would cause as many as one million American casualties. In return for the Soviet Union's entrance into the war against Japan, the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island. With the Soviet Union in control of much of Eastern Europe by early 1945, Roosevelt had little leverage over Soviet actions in Eastern Europe. He did not push for the immediate evacuation of Soviet soldiers from Poland, but he did win the issuance of the Declaration on Liberated Europe, which promised free elections in countries that had been occupied by Germany. Against Soviet pressure, Roosevelt and Churchill refused to consent to imposing huge reparations and deindustrialization on Germany after the war. Roosevelt's role in the Yalta Conference has been controversial; critics charge that he naively trusted the Soviet Union to allow free elections in Eastern Europe, while supporters argue that there was little more that Roosevelt could have done for the Eastern European countries given the Soviet occupation and the need for cooperation with the Soviet Union during and after the war. =Founding the United Nations= Roosevelt had been a strong supporter of the League of Nations back in 1919-20, but was determined to avoid the mistakes Wilson had made. The United Nations was FDR's highest postwar priority. He insisted on full coordination with the Republican leadership. He made sure that leading Republicans were on board, especially Senators Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan,James A. Gazell, \\"Arthur H. Vandenberg, Internationalism, and the United Nations.\\" Political Science Quarterly 88#3 (1973): 375-394. online and Warren Austin of Vermont.George T. Mazuzan. Warren R. Austin at the U. N., 1946-1953 (Kent State UP, 1977).. In a broad sense, Roosevelt believed that the UN could solve the minor problems and provide the chief mechanism to resolve any major Issues that arose among the great powers, all of whom had a veto. For FDR creating the UN was the most important goal for the entire war effort. For FDR, \\"establishing the United Nations organization was the overarching strategic goal, the absolute first priority.\\" Roosevelt was especially interested in international protection of human right, and in this area his wife played a major role as well.Ivy P. Urdang, \\"Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: Human Rights and the Creation of the United Nations.\\" OAH Magazine of History 22.2 (2008): 28-31. M. Glen Johnson, \\"The contributions of Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt to the development of international protection for human rights.\\" Human Rights Quarterly 9 (1987): 19+. The Allies had agreed to the basic structure of the new body at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944. Hoopes and Brinkley, FDR and the Creation of the U. N. (1997) pp 148-58. At Yalta, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin agreed to the establishment of the United Nations, as well as the structure of the United Nations Security Council. Stalin insisted on having a veto and FDR finally agreed. The participants at Yalta also agreed that the United Nations would convene for the first time in San Francisco in April 1945 in the United Nations Conference on International Organization. Roosevelt considered the United Nations to be his most important legacy. He provided continuous backstage political support at home and with Churchill and Stalin abroad. The Big Four of the United States, Britain, Soviet Union and China would make the major decisions, with France added later to provide permanent members of the all-powerful Security Council. Each had a veto power, thus avoiding the fatal weakness of the League of Nations, which had theoretically been able to order its members to act in defiance of their own parliaments.: John Allphin Moore Jr. and Jerry Pubantz, To Create a New World?: American Presidents & the United Nations (1999), pp 27-79. =Anti-imperialism= British, French, and Dutch leaders all hoped to retain or reclaim their colonial possessions after the war. The U.S. was committed to granting independence to the Philippines following the end of the war, and Roosevelt frequently pressured Churchill to similarly commit to the independence of India, Burma, Malaya, and Hong Kong. His motives included principled opposition to colonialism, practical concern for the outcome of the war, and the need to build support for the U.S. in a future independent India. Churchill was deeply committed to imperialism and pushed back hard. Because the U.S. needed British cooperation in India to support China, Roosevelt had to draw back on his anti-colonialism.Kenton J. Clymer, \\"Franklin D. Roosevelt, Louis Johnson, India, and Anticolonialism: Another Look.\\" Pacific Historical Review 57#3 (1988): 261-284. online That annoyed Indian nationalist leaders, though most of those leaders were in British prisons for the duration because they would not support the war against Japan.William Roger Louis, Imperialism at Bay: The United States and the Decolonization of the British Empire, 1941‚Äì1945 (1987)Eric S.

While he viewed himself as a man of letters, he prized his stories and poems above his other work. To Goodman, writing was \\"his vice\\" or \\"way of being in the world\\".  Background  Goodman began to write stories in high school. He often composed in pencil on scraps that he carried. Goodman wrote his stories on cheap newsprint and his longhand filled every available space, to its edges. He typed his second draft and might pencil corrections before sending it for editing. Goodman's passion was for writing, not finishing. He continually returned to his works and was known to make revisions in printed editions even when the work had no plans for re-release. He would receive criticism for revising some works dozens of years after their publication, \\"spoiling their favorites\\". For the first half of his life, Goodman thought he did his best work in the middle of the night. He attempted a rhythm of writing at least a page daily such that he would have frequent temptation to lose himself in the work. This daily calisthenic of finishing a thought at his own pace contributed to Goodman's prolific output. Goodman's story manuscripts read as rhapsodic episodes, showing few pauses and fitting together like a prose poem. In his early years, Goodman also wrote scenes in the style of Guy de Maupassant, was accused of imitating James Joyce, and explored the styles of Ring Lardner, Jean Cocteau, and Pierre Mac Orlan. But Goodman's literary executor, Taylor Stoehr, likened Goodman's style to Nathaniel Hawthorne most of all. Much of Goodman's fiction was based on his life and as a result, included self-examination among its themes. Johnson and The Break-Up of Our Camp, written after his college graduation, were based on a romantic interest and Jewish boys' camp where Goodman was a counselor. Some chapters of these novels-in-stories were published in magazines. In the late 1930s, after moving to Chicago, Goodman reconsidered his approach to fiction and wrote a dozen works of prose in a style he termed \\"cubist\\", in which he abstracted its formal/literary elements as alienated from mere character relations. Of these stories, \\"A Ceremonial\\", received the most critical attention, but Klaus Mann saw serenity where Goodman had intended an alienated tone. Goodman received fair recognition within New York literary circles into 1940 as he published in multiple magazines, but many opportunities soon fell through, particularly as Goodman made enemies with his aggressive World War II pacifism. Goodman's Japanese Noh plays, Stop-Light, released a week after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Grand Piano, his antiwar novel, fell flat against the Philippines campaign. After publishing little in 1943 and being fired for seducing his students, Goodman was becoming notorious. Small presses continued to publish his works, but Goodman was bothered by his self-image as an embattled writer alienated from society, both well-published and unknown at once. While continuing to write over 100 stories, plays, essays, and constant poems throughout the 1940s, Goodman channeled his troubles into his writing and focused on the social issues associated with his alienation‚Äîpolitics, psychosexuality, religion‚Äîand wrote on topics including education, anarchism (\\"The May Pamphlet\\"), and civic design (Communitas). Meanwhile, in his fiction, Goodman's epic novel project The Empire City was an inward-looking satire subtitled \\"An Almanac of Alienation\\". He wrote it as a series of heroic portraits whose characters were abstractions of \\"sociological and psychological causes\\". In his short stories, Goodman removed conventional plot, character, and setting as familial essays with his self-styled \\"cubist\\" literary emphasis on formal manner. He called these styles \\"expressionistic naturalism\\" and \\"dialectical lyrics\\", respectively, though the literary experiments outgrew the label. He stopped categorizing his career stages upon growing comfortable with his stature in the field. In the mid-1940s, Goodman's stories became more polemical in indignant self-defense of his provocative lifestyle, though as he entered therapy, the stories became self-critical and reflective of psychoanalytic ideas. In one work, he remarked that \\"disparaging the ego\\" and hatred of self were the core theme of his stories. In \\"Incidents of the Labyrinth\\", an allegory of soul-searching in the myth of the Labyrinth, Goodman recounted how those who search for the meaning of life (or others who ask those questions) are likely to be unhappy. His late-1940s stories were part of his self-analysis (e.g., free analysis and childhood memories) with fewer formal devices, more openings to the unconscious, and clear analogies of inward searching. Goodman came to see his fiction as \\"myths\\" in the 1950s, either by finding something mythical in a traditional American scene or in finding something familiar in an ancient, foreign myth. In these works, Goodman wrote about rescuers and doctors who save their victims but not themselves. In this period, Goodman moved past motifs of \\"divided self\\" and towards making whole: \\"Relent, remedy\\". Goodman believed in paradise lost, that the power of healers (to remedy) comes from sacrificing their own health and happiness (to relent). For example, the sailors of \\"The Galley to Mytilene\\" revive the survivors, signifying how after relenting towards himself, Goodman is free to relent towards others (the survivors). The plot of \\"relent, remedy\\" recurs throughout much of the Goodman's remaining fiction (\\"The Death of Aesculapius\\", \\"Bathers at Westover Pond\\") up through his breakthrough work of social criticism, Growing Up Absurd (1960), which brought the theme into real life. Goodman said that the book was the action he had wanted for his fictional heroes, the culmination of his therapy, theorizing, alienation, and provocations. Throughout the 1960s, Goodman focused on social criticism and his therapeutic role in healing the alienated. He wrote no short stories after 1960.

Wadden (born September 3, 1952) is a clinical psychologist and educator who is known for his research on the treatment of obesity by methods that include lifestyle modification, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. He is the Albert J. Stunkard Professor of Psychology in Psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and former director of the University's Center for Weight and Eating Disorders. He also is Visiting Professor of Psychology at Haverford College. Wadden has published more than 500 peer-reviewed scientific papers and abstracts, as well as 7 edited books. Over the course of his career, he has served on expert panels for the National Institutes of Health, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the U.S. House of Representatives. His research has been recognized by awards from several organizations including the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy and The Obesity Society. Wadden is a fellow of the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, the Obesity Society, and Society of Behavioral Medicine. In 2015, the Obesity Society created the Thomas A. Wadden Award for Distinguished Mentorship, recognizing his education of scientists and practitioners in the field of obesity.  Early life and education  Wadden is a native of Washington, D.C. and a graduate of the Landon School in Bethesda, Maryland. He received his bachelor's degree in psychology in 1975 from Brown University and his doctorate in clinical psychology in 1981 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Career  In 1982, Wadden was appointed to the faculty in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, where he began his clinical and research career on the treatment of obesity and its associated eating disorders. After a decade at Penn, he joined Syracuse University as Professor of Psychology, Director of Clinical Training, and Director of the Center for Health and Behavior. He returned to the University of Pennsylvania in 1994 as Professor of Psychology in the Department of Psychiatry. He also was appointed at this time as Director of Penn's Center for Weight and Eating Disorders, which he led for more than two decades (1994-2017). During this time he also held numerous positions in the Obesity Society, serving as President in 2005-2006. In 2011 Wadden was named the inaugural recipient of the Albert J. Stunkard Chair in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. In this position, he currently is continuing his program of research on obesity which has been supported by the NIH for more than 30 years. Wadden joined the faculty of Haverford College as visiting professor in 2013 and has also taught at Bryn Mawr College. Wadden is a fellow of the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, the Obesity Society, and the Society of Behavioral Medicine. He has served on the editorial boards of Behavior Therapy, Health Psychology, International Journal of Eating Disorders, International Journal of Obesity, and Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology. He was an associate editor of Annals of Behavioral Medicine from 1990 to 1993 and of the journal Obesity from 2007 to 2012. Over the course of his career, Wadden has served on expert panels for the National Institutes of Health, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the U.S. House of Representatives. His research has been recognized by awards from the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy, the Obesity Society, the Association for Psychologists in Academic Health Centers, and the Department of Psychology at the University of North Carolina. He also has been honored by the Obesity Society and the Perelman School of Medicine for distinguished mentoring of research fellows and junior faculty. = Research and work = Wadden has published more than 500 peer-reviewed scientific papers and abstracts, as well as 7 edited books, the most recent of which is Handbook of Obesity Treatment, 2nd edition (with George A. Bray). Wadden's early contributions to the management of obesity included the first controlled, long-term trial of high protein, very low calorie diets (<800 kcal/d) and the documentation of the marked weight regain with this approach. With colleagues, he provided a model for commercial weight loss programs to evaluate and publish their short- and long-term weight losses, thus, allowing physicians and their patients to make informed choices among programs. This work resulted in Congressional testimony and in a collaboration with the Federal Trade Commission, other researchers, and members of the weight loss industry to improve information provided to prospective dieters. In other areas, Wadden has shown the benefits of combining weight loss medications with intensive lifestyle modification, which produces weight losses substantially greater than either intervention used alone. With colleagues from the Look AHEAD Research Group, he demonstrated that patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes who lost approximately 8% of initial weight with an intensive lifestyle intervention experienced long-term improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life, and medical care costs. Wadden also has worked to increase the provision of behavioral treatment for obesity in primary care settings, as recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. His evidence-based treatment manual on this topic is available, on the web, to practitioners and researchers. With Gary Foster, Wadden also developed the Weight and Lifestyle Inventory (WALI), which is widely used to assess the behavioral and psychosocial status of candidates for bariatric surgery.

The publication The two founders of The Photogram were Henry Snowden Ward and the significant American feminist photographer Catharine Weed Barnes who married in 1893. She, who was born in Albany, had become a photographer in 1886 and in 1890 became an editor of American Amateur Photographer magazine, contributing a column entitled 'Women's Work'. He was born in Bradford, where by 1884 he was working with Percy Lund & Co., and for them in 1890 launched and edited The Practical Photographer, which he left when together the couple started The Photogram, published in London by Dawbarn and Ward, which continued until 1920. The couple's punctilious insistence on the term 'photogram' in this title and many of their others was a result of their conviction that the etymology of 'photography' demanded that the word 'photograph' was the verb, and that the product of the act of photography was the photogram, just as one 'telegraphs' a 'telegram'. From 1906 they appear to have bowed to common usage, renaming The Photogram as The Photographic Monthly; 'Photogram' has since come to mean a camera-less form of photography. Format and contents The monthly magazine catered to the advanced amateur and professional and promoted Pictorialism, which was emerging in the 1890s, and art photography, with contributions from by Francis Meadow Sutcliffe, member of The Linked Ring, among other significant authors. Each issue was of about 24 pages measuring about 15 √ó 23 cm (9 √ó 6 inches) and a regular feature was a supplement of full-page photographs printed in high quality; it was a little smaller than the pages of its contemporary the British Journal of Photography and other early photographic journals. As an example of the magazine's contents, the March 1895 issue contained articles on Henry Peach Robinson (pp. 65‚Äì72) and a brief biography of Scottish-born J. Traill Taylor FRPS, founder of the Edinburgh Photographic Society and editor of the British Journal of Photography who was to die of dysentery in Florida later that year in November (pp. 57‚Äì58). These articles were accompanied by portraits of the two men and reviews of their books; Picture Making by Photography by HP Robinson and Optics of Photography and Photographic Lenses by J Traill Taylor. The picture supplement was devoted to photo-micrographic work by Scottish microbiologist A.H. Baird. Other titles  =The American Photogram= The Photogram was simultaneously published in America as The American Photogram with an American section ‚Äúwith the latest home news\\" edited by there by F.J. Harrison, with its own numbering. =The Process Photogram= Due to Ward‚Äôs and Barnes' own interest in the growing industry of photomechanical reproduction, and increasingly, that of a cohort of their readers, they added a small supplement on the technology. By 1896 it had increased in size and was released as a separate trade journal The Process Photogram. =The Photographic Monthly= The Photogram was renamed and continued as The Photographic Monthly after 1906. =The Photogram newsletter= There is an unrelated recent title, also The Photogram, that is the newsletter of the Michigan Photographic Historical Society, published quarterly since 1972.

History  A contract for the construction Alexandria shipyard and the supply of its shop‚Äôs equipment was signed in 1962 with the government of the Soviet Union. The yard foundation was laid beside the site of Alexandria Port old graving dock. In 1963 the shipyard apprentice training center was opened to train and qualify the shipbuilding and ship repair personnel. In 1964 the shipyard mechanical slipway with carriage lifting capacity of 600 Tons was opened for service. In 1965 a new graving dock built by a German contractor with a capacity of 85,000 dwt went into service. In 1968 the rest of the shipyard area was reclaimed from the sea and the building of two semi submerged inclined berths were completed. Each can be used for building of vessels to 35,000 dwt. In 1969 after the shipyard has been practically completed, construction of large merchant ships started. In 1971 the first dry cargo vessel \\"ALEXANDRIA CLASS\\" M/V Alexandria was launched and towed to the yard outfitting quay for fitting out and delivery. Since then the yard has built and delivered 35 vessels of different types and sizes. By 1976, Russian involvement in the shipyard was curtailed. In 2004 the shipyard ownership was transferred to the Ministry of Defense under the Maritime Industries and Services Organization (MIASO). In 2011, a contract was signed for upgrading of the shipyard main building facilities with China State Shipbuilding Corporation's China Shipbuilding Trading Co., Ltd. and the work was completed in 2015. In 2014, the Egyptian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement for the construction of four El Fateh- class corvette. The first vessel was built in Lorient site of DCNS (later Naval Group) and delivered to Egypt in September 2017. The remaining three units of the series were built through technology transfer at the Alexandria Shipyard. The last was delivered in 2020.

Known as one of the most prominent cooperative bankers in Germany during and after the Nazi era, he has been revealed by recent research as a leading member of the military resistance. Thanks to his cover as a banker, he managed to escape the purge that followed the failed July Bomb Plot. In 1935, Hartmann began to have contact with the military resistance. In early 1940, when summoned by the commander of North West France, he had contact with the Commander-in-Chief OB West, Erwin von Witzleben. In 1942, he became a member of the staff of the military commander of occupied France, Carl-Heinrich von St√ºlpnagel. Together with General Hans Speidel, Colonel Karl-Richard Ko√ümann, Colonel Eberhard Finckh and Lieutenant Colonel Caesar von Hofacker, Hartmann became part of the core of the military resistance circles in Paris. During the May of 1944, Hartmann and his fellow plotters tried to win Rommel over as a leading figure for the resistance. According to Hartmann, Rommel gave his decisive approval for the assassination attempt in a meeting at Hartmann's quarters in Mareil- Marly at the end of May. Schweizer considers Hartmann's eye-witness testimonies to be an important evidence in support of Rommel's knowledge and support of the assassination attempt. In 19 July 1944, Hartmann left Paris for Stuttgart and Murrhardt, and then went back to Paris (the driver, who also knew about and was involved in the plotters' plan, was Feldwebel Herbert Herold, another businessman in his civilian life). In the event of a successful attack, the Wehrmacht would have retreated from France and returned to South Germany, thus preparation had to be made. The whole process was conducted in cooperation with Goerdeler and Robert Bosch. Historian Christian Schweizer comments that Hartmann's motivation arose from his negative experiences as a banker and later as a reserved officer under the Nazi regime. His dual role as an officer in the Wehrmacht and a chief banker in Stuttgart illustrates a network of resistance, which not only demonstrated the leading roles of Prussian aristocrats and military officers in the later assassination attempt on Hitler, but also bore the mark of the liberal-economic character of the W√ºrttemberg region.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Fraser, to the northwest. The Continental Divide lies to the west, Angle Peak is situated to the southeast, and The Ramparts are to the north. The mountain's north ridge terminates at Outpost Peak. History The mountain's name was applied in 1916 by Morrison P.

It was established in 2012 for use by NATO as an early-warning radar against ballistic missile attacks. Background At the NATO Lisbon summit in November 2010, a strategic plan was concluded to establish a ballistic missile defense system covering all alliance members. As a NATO member state, the government of Turkey approved the installation of an early-warning radar system on its territory, but insisted on a condition that all the information gathered at the radar station would be strictly for use by the NATO member states. After signing an agreement on final conditions in September 2011, officials from Turkey and the U.S. determined a site near the town of K√ºrecik in the Ak√ßadaƒü district of Malatya Province as feasible. In the 1960s, the site hosted a radar base for surveillance of the Soviet Union airspace. K√ºrecik is located west of Malatya. The radar station is situated on the hill of √áat Tepe at an elevation of . Controversy The residents of K√ºrecik and many others from the region expressed their opposition and mounted protests right after the announcement of the radar site. In September 2011, Iran criticized Turkey for the establishment of the early-warning radar in southeastern Turkey, fearing it would serve to protect Israel from Iranian missile attacks in case of a war. Installation and operation The installation of the radar system was carried out by U.S. military personnel. The establishment of the radar station was completed in February 2012. The radar station's control was transferred to NATO command in the frame of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). The installed radar is an Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance (AN/TPY-2), a Forward-Based X-Band Transportable (FBX-T) surveillance radar developed by Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, featuring long-range, very high-altitude active electronically scanned array. The radar site's command center is at Diyarbakƒ±r Air Base east of K√ºrecik. The K√ºrecik radar station's mission is to relay tracking and discrimination data to a remote missile defense system, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), stationed in Romania and Poland. Radar range data varies widely as the AN/TPY-2 is used both in forward-based and terminal-based modes. The K√ºrecik radar as a forward-based radar is deployed in a reasonable proximity to the assumed missile launch site. K√ºrecik's distance to the Iran-Turkey border is about . About 50 U.S. soldiers were deployed to the radar station for protection and internal security. The Turkish government did not allow foreign civilian technicians at the site for intelligence concerns. Turkey took the responsibility for the external protection of the radar site, which is situated in an isolated region, against sabotage attacks. A team of the Engineer Research and Development Center's (ERDC) Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers provided technical solutions for the military personnel stationed at the high-elevation K√ºrecik radar site, where harsh weather conditions occur in winter time. The early-warning radar is owned by the U.S. Army, and operated by the U.S. Army Europe. See also *Pirin√ßlik Air Base, a former radar base in southeastern Turkey.

Although born in the United States, Danaher grew up in New Zealand, until arriving in the United States in 1991 to study at Columbia University's philosophy PhD program. After arriving in New York, Danaher was introduced to Brazilian jiu-jitsu by a friend at the university, and began taking classes at Renzo Gracie's academy in Manhattan.https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/the-jujitsu- master-turning-an-ancient-art-into-a-modern-science He continued training at the academy and began to teach classes as well while Gracie was traveling for competition. Since receiving his black belt in the early 2000s, he has been an instructor for several notable jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts competitors. Early life and education John Danaher was born in Washington, D.C., United States. His father, a pilot in the New Zealand air force, acted as an attach√© to the United States military during the Vietnam War. His family later returned to Whangaparaoa, a small peninsula north of Auckland, New Zealand, where Danaher spent the remainder of his childhood. He also learned kickboxing, and some karate as martial arts were becoming popular in New Zealand. After high school, Danaher attended the University of Auckland, where he earned a Bachelor's, and later a master's degree in philosophy. In 1991, he returned to the United States to pursue a Ph.D. in epistemology at Columbia University in Manhattan. While attending the university, Danaher worked as a bouncer at various Manhattan night clubs. Martial arts career While he had some striking ability from his time in New Zealand, Danaher's dedication to martial arts did not fully begin until he began training at the Renzo Gracie Academy in the early 1990s. While there, he studied under legendary jiu-jitsu practitioner Renzo Gracie, and became one of his most dedicated students, alongside Rodrigo Gracie, Matt Serra, and Ricardo Almeida. As a purple belt, he began to teach some classes at the academy while Renzo was traveling to compete in mixed martial arts competitions. Over the next several years, with many of his peers leaving to start their own academies, Danaher's responsibilities as an instructor at Renzo Gracie Academy grew, and Danaher became a full-time instructor at the school. Being that Danaher has suffered throughout his life from severe leg and hip problems, he has never competed professionally, and as a result has devoted his time and effort to teaching. As his students have had success in competition and gained notoriety over the last several years, he has become well known as a jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts coach, having worked closely with fighters such as Georges St-Pierre and Chris Weidman. Additionally, he coaches a group of notable jiu-jitsu competitors at Renzo Gracie Academy, often referred to as the 'Danaher Death Squad.' The group includes athletes such as Gordon Ryan, Garry Tonon, Nick Rodriguez, and Nicky Ryan (Gordon's younger brother), who between them hold numerous world championships, spanning multiple organizations, including IBJJF, ADCC, Eddie Bravo Invitational, and others. Since 2018, Danaher has been a member of Sanabul (https://sanabulsports.com/pages/team-sanabul), a combat sports brand, serving as a brand ambassador and consultant. Additionally, John Danaher is partnered with BJJ Fanatics for the release of his two series of instructionals, the \\"Enter the System\\" series and the \\"Go Further Faster\\" series. Leg lock system Danaher is also known for developing his own system of leg-locks and lower-body attacks. He was first introduced to the effectiveness of leg locks when Dean Lister, an American grappler who was having success in competitions utilizing leg-based attacks, came to train at Renzo Gracie Academy for two weeks in the early 2000s. With the leg lock system, Danaher was able to consolidate a large number of distinct positions and moves into a more formulaic and predictable series of procedures that could be executed by his students. Using the principles that Danaher set out in his system, his students had tremendous success utilizing leg locks in competition. Danaher is credited with helping to alter the jiu- jitsu community's opinion of leg locks, as many saw them as a non-technical and ineffective method of attack before Danaher's students demonstrated their usefulness in competition. Danaher has since developed systems for various types of arm attacks (notably Kimura variations and Armbars), back and rear strangle-based attacks, Front Headlock and guillotine attacks, and Triangle attacks as part of his \\"Enter the System\\" series. Most recently he has published beginner-oriented DVDs under the name of the \\"Go Further Faster\\" series; the topics covered thus far include Half Guard, Guard Passing, Closed Guard, Pin Escapes, Guard Retention and Open Guard. The next DVD in the series is expected to cover passing Half Guard as well as Dynamic Pinning concepts. Health problems Having been born with deformed patellas, Danaher was prone to knee injuries throughout his early years. In the 1980s, Danaher suffered a severe knee injury to his left leg while playing rugby, which required surgery. The result of multiple surgeries on his left knee was artificially shortened and deformed ligaments, which drastically inhibited Danaher's ability to properly extend and retract his knee. Over the years, this imbalance proceeded to cause other problems for Danaher. Namely, an unbalanced gait caused Danaher's left hip to be subjected to undue force and strain, leading to severe osteoarthritis. The damaged hip ultimately required a replacement, which Danaher underwent in 2015. TV and Film Appearances In 2017, Danaher appeared in four episodes of the Showtime series Billions, in which he portrays the jiu-jitsu instructor of U.S. Attorney Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti). In 2012, he appeared as himself on the Spike TV series MMA Uncensored Live episode ‚ÄúKing Mo Reigns‚Äù. In 2015, Danaher co-starred in the documentary \\"Jiu Jitsu vs the World\\" alongside renowned Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners Eddie Bravo, Renzo Gracie, and Roberto Abreu, among others.

Biography Hunt was born in Caulfield, Victoria, to Winifred Monica Hunt (nee Hayes) and Brian James Hunt, in 1962. He attended Mazenod College and Deakin University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts in journalism and a Masters of Arts in defence, and was named editor of the student newspaper Planet. Hunt was hired by the Australian Associated Press (AAP) as a cadet and moved quickly through the ranks in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra before joining Agence France-Presse (AFP) in Hong Kong, where he covered the end of the British empire and was dispatched to Afghanistan as bureau chief during Taliban rule. Hunt covered Taliban offensives in 1997 and 1998, launched against Ahmad Shah Masood and his Northern Alliance. While there he was charged with espionage and told by Taliban Information Minister Mutmaeen Mutawakkil he would \\"be executed on the football pitch\\" in Kabul. However, Hunt was found not guilty in a Sharia court after a lengthy interrogation and was later commended by the United Nations special envoy Lahkdar Brahimi for the 'best and most insightful' coverage of the civil war. He returned to cover the US invasion and occupation of Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks and was embedded with the 1st Marine Expeditionary Forces during the invasion of Iraq where he rose in prominence with his coverage for AFP and CNN as marines crossed the Diyala River and entered Baghdad. He was embedded with the 101st Airborne Division on a second tour later the same year. Asked in Kuwait why the US was invading Iraq, Hunt replied: \\"There's beer in Baghdad\\" amid a gaggle of war correspondents. \\"It became a battle cry for reporters sent to this dusty, alcohol-free region so far from home.\\" Hunt has covered the Indian/Pakistan conflict over Kashmir, the Sri Lankan civil war and the border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, which erupted at Preah Vihear in early 2008 when Hunt became a freelancer. He has also covered the ongoing running Khmer Rouge Tribunal since its inception. Luke Hunt pictured in Phnom Penh, 2019 He has since written for Time magazine, Far East Economic Review, The Times of London, The Economist, The New York Times, The Associated Press, The Washington Times and The Age in Melbourne. Hunt has maintained a sharp focus on Indochina since arriving in Vietnam as the Cold War was ending. His exclusive interviews with Gen. Pham Xuan An, Gen. Tran Van Tra, Tran Bach Dang and Khieu Samphan led to the publication of his second book The Punji Trap. However, it was his experience in Afghanistan that enabled him to specialise in counter-terrorism and jihadi groups, like Jemaah Islamiyah, in Southeast Asia spending four years based out of Malaysian Borneo and a further seven years working from Cambodia. In Phnom Penh, Hunt was appointed as an academic program professor by Pannasastra University where he wrote the course War, Media and International Relations. He writes regularly about Southeast Asian affairs for UCAsia News and The Diplomat, reports for Voice of America and AAP, and is a regular on radio in Australia and Hong Kong. Hunt is a former president and life member of the Overseas Press Club of Cambodia. He is also a founding member of the Foreign Correspondents Club of Malaysia and a former board member of the Foreign Correspondents Club in Hong Kong. In his work for The Diplomat, Hunt hosts a semi-regular podcast where he talks to journalists, academics and Southeast Asian specialists.

Biography His father was a surveyor who helped lay out his hometown. As a young man, he probably worked in his father's gristmill, although some of his paintings indicate that he may have worked in the lumber industry as well. After travelling throughout Pennsylvania in the 1850s, the year 1863 found him in Washington, D.C., where he may have worked on the new United States Capitol dome. The following year, he enlisted in the Union Army and was assigned to the Presidential Guard detail.Biography @ the National Gallery of Art. He was honorably discharged in 1865 and received a thank you note from President Lincoln, which he reportedly had buried with him. Apparently, he held some sort of government job until 1868, when he returned to his hometown. He would spend the rest of his life there. Later, he and a brother opened a planing mill, which was financially quite successful. At that time, the City Directory listed him as a painter and it is likely that he mostly painted signs, wagons and furniture. Known for his eccentric personality and odd behavior, he lived as something of a recluse and never married. He was also an amateur inventor. In 1873, he patented \\"improved ventilating blinds\\" which bear a resemblance to modern venetian blinds. They were later awarded first prize at the Centennial Exposition. His other inventions include a hat rack, a \\"feather renovator\\" for cleaning the stuffing in pillows and mattresses, and a vegetable peeler (he was a lifelong vegetarian). An advertisement from 1876 indicates that he made \\"house decorations\\", probably of an architectural nature, and picture frames. No record of any formal artistic training exists and it appears that he did not begin painting individual pictures until late in life; possibly after he retired. His best known work, the \\"Flax Scutching Bee\\", dates from 1885 and the above mentioned logging pictures may come from the 1890s. He is also said to have created a picture of the Johnstown Flood, the proceeds from which would benefit the survivors, but its whereabouts are unknown. In 1904, a fire at a makeshift studio he had set up in an old creamery destroyed most of his belongings. After that, he moved into an Old soldiers' home in Erie, where he died two years later. The number of paintings lost in the fire (if any) is unknown, but only thirteen paintings are definitely known to be his. Six of those are painted on bed ticking. References Further reading * J.

It was first published in hardcover by Warner Books in April 1987, with a paperback edition issued by Questar/Popular Library in February 1988. The first British edition was published in paperback by Orbit in June 1987, with a hardcover edition following from Macdonald in August of the same year. The novel has also been translated into Italian. Summary Seven years ago, Terra Viridian was convicted of mass murder for the senseless massacre of 1500 people, and sentenced to the orbiting prison colony known as the Underworld. Now various people scarred or obsessed by the crime converge on the prison seeking answers. All have been somehow touched by projections of the maddening, invasive visions that have overwhelmed Terra's mind. Those affected include Sydney the space musicologist, a scientist with a device capable of displaying her mental images, patroler Aaron Fisher, whose wife died in the massacre and who is still hunting Terra's twin sister Michele, Magic Man the Bach master, and his protege, the mysterious golden-masked musician called the Queen of Hearts. The Queen of Hearts, whose band has been booked to perform an experimental rock concert in the prison, harbors her own a secret. Unknown to all, including her lover Aaron, she is herself Terra's sister, having gone into hiding after her twin's crime. Brought face to face by the concert, the sisters' psychic connection triggers a change of events that changes everyone's lives. When Terra escapes, the pursuit that follows forces all the characters to deal with the reality behind her visions; an extra-galactic alien life form struggling towards birth.

Description  Females are about 6mm in length. Cephalothorax is golden brown, abdomen is tan with faint markings. However, colour is very variable and is assumed to aid camouflage.  Behaviour  Diaea ambara are ambush predators that typically hunt on the leaves of bushes and trees. Males search for the female to begin courtship. The male will approach from the side and use his front legs to touch the females front legs and then her body while she retracts her legs and crouches. The male then proceeds to lash the female down with silk and crawls underneath her and commences mating. After mating, the male leaves and the female easily gets free of the silk.

Therefore, there are many techniques to isolate haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs can be identified or isolated by the use of flow cytometry where the combination of several different cell surface markers are used to separate the rare HSCs from the surrounding blood cells. HSCs lack expression of mature blood cell markers and are thus, called Lin-. Lack of expression of lineage markers is used in combination with detection of several positive cell-surface markers to isolate HSCs. In addition, HSCs are characterised by their small size and low staining with vital dyes such as rhodamine 123 (rhodamine lo) or Hoechst 33342 (side population). Cluster of differentiation and other markers The classical marker of human HSC is CD34 first described independently by Civin et al. and Tindle et al. It is used to isolate HSC for reconstitution of patients who are haematologically incompetent as a result of chemotherapy or disease. Many markers belong to the cluster of differentiation series, like: CD34, CD38, CD90, CD133, CD105, CD45, and also c-kit ‚Äì the receptor for stem cell factor. There are many differences between the human and murine hematopoietic cell markers for the commonly accepted type of hematopoietic stem cells. *Mouse HSC: EMCN+, CD34lo/‚àí, SCA-1+, Thy1.1+/lo, CD38+, C-kit+, lin‚àí *Human HSC: EMCN+, CD34+, CD59+, Thy1/CD90+, CD38lo/‚àí, C-kit/CD117+, lin‚àí However, not all stem cells are covered by these combinations that, nonetheless, have become popular. In fact, even in humans, there are hematopoietic stem cells that are CD34‚àí/CD38‚àí. Also some later studies suggested that earliest stem cells may lack c-kit on the cell surface. For human HSCs use of CD133 was one step ahead as both CD34+ and CD34‚àí HSCs were CD133+. Traditional purification method used to yield a reasonable purity level of mouse hematopoietic stem cells, in general, requires a large (~10‚Äì12) battery of markers, most of which were surrogate markers with little functional significance, and thus partial overlap with the stem cell populations and sometimes other closely related cells that are not stem cells. Also, some of these markers (e.g., Thy1) are not conserved across mouse species, and use of markers like CD34‚àí for HSC purification requires mice to be at least 8 weeks old. SLAM code Alternative methods that could give rise to a similar or better harvest of stem cells is an active area of research, and are presently emerging. One such method uses a signature of SLAM family cell surface molecules. The SLAM (Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule) family is a group of more than 10 molecules whose genes are located mostly tandemly in a single locus on chromosome 1 (mouse), all belonging to a subset of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, and originally thought to be involved in T-cell stimulation. This family includes CD48, CD150, CD244, etc., CD150 being the founding member, and, thus, also known as slamF1, i.e., SLAM family member 1. The signature SLAM codes for the hemopoietic hierarchy are: *Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC): CD150+CD48‚àíCD244‚àí *Multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs): CD150‚àíCD48‚àíCD244+ *Lineage-restricted progenitor cells (LRPs): CD150‚àíCD48+CD244+ *Common myeloid progenitor (CMP): lin‚àíSCA-1‚àíc-kit+CD34+CD16/32mid *Granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP): lin‚àíSCA-1‚àíc-kit+CD34+CD16/32hi *Megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP): lin‚àíSCA-1‚àíc-kit+CD34‚àíCD16/32low For HSCs, CD150+CD48‚àí was sufficient instead of CD150+CD48‚àíCD244‚àí because CD48 is a ligand for CD244, and both would be positive only in the activated lineage-restricted progenitors. It seems that this code was more efficient than the more tedious earlier set of the large number of markers, and are also conserved across the mouse strains; however, recent work has shown that this method excludes a large number of HSCs and includes an equally large number of non-stem cells. CD150+CD48‚àí gave stem cell purity comparable to Thy1loSCA-1+lin‚àíc-kit+ in mice. LT-HSC/ST-HSC/early MPP/late MPP Irving Weissman's group at Stanford University was the first to isolate mouse hematopoietic stem cells in 1988 and was also the first to work out the markers to distinguish the mouse long-term (LT-HSC) and short-term (ST-HSC) hematopoietic stem cells (self-renew- capable), and the Multipotent progenitors (MPP, low or no self-renew capability ‚Äì the later the developmental stage of MPP, the lesser the self- renewal ability and the more of some of the markers like CD4 and CD135): *LT- HSC: CD34‚àí, CD38‚àí, SCA-1+, Thy1.1+/lo, C-kit+, lin‚àí, CD135‚àí, Slamf1/CD150+ *ST-HSC: CD34+, CD38+, SCA-1+, Thy1.1+/lo, C-kit+, lin‚àí, CD135‚àí, Slamf1/CD150+, Mac-1 (CD11b)lo *Early MPP: CD34+, SCA-1+, Thy1.1‚àí, C-kit+, lin‚àí, CD135+, Slamf1/CD150‚àí, Mac-1 (CD11b)lo, CD4lo *Late MPP: CD34+, SCA-1+, Thy1.1‚àí, C-kit+, lin‚àí, CD135high, Slamf1/CD150‚àí, Mac-1 (CD11b)lo, CD4lo References Category:Stem cell research ","title":"Techniques to isolate haematopoietic stem cells"},{"id":"61235213","text":"Moving heads connected to a plug-in box (center) In stage lighting, a plug-in box, plug box or drop box is a device to distribute power to multiple lighting instruments, consisting of an inlet (either detachable or hard-wired), and multiple female outlet connectors or pigtails.

He commented: \\"I'm glad I saw it. I enjoyed all the people I met during Nick's six-month quest. Most seemed cheerful and outgoing, and exuded good health. They smiled a lot. They weren't creepy true believers obsessed with converting everyone.\\" Nathan Lee, writing in The New York Times, calls Churchill's approach a \\"shrewd idea\\", choosing a yoga novice rather than her own experience as the film's focus. In Lee's view, Rosen, \\"a physically fit, intellectually skeptical journalist from New York\\", both enables the viewer \\"to explore yoga through a surrogate, and it marginalizes Ms. Churchill's blatant agenda and rather grating personality.\\" Rosen finds yoga a good workout but retains \\"an open mind and a dubious eye for [yoga's] more metaphysical trappings.\\" Lee writes that the film lives up to the promise of its title, providing \\"a light touch and welcome sense of humor.\\" He concludes that the \\"lack of resolution about yoga‚Äôs ultimate goal suggests that Mr. Rosen wasn‚Äôt the only one to gain some self-knowledge along the way.\\" Joseph Jon Lanthier, writing for Slant magazine, states that he presumes the film's audience is skeptics of yoga and of \\"guruism in general\\". He notes that the director, Churchill, appears throughout the film, \\"hardly shy about her own reservations with yoga\\" despite years of practice, while Rosen's pragmatic worldview \\"springs from friction between his practical, legal counselor father and his spacey, New Age mother\\". Lanthier notes that Allen and Iyengar do not try to argue with agnosticism: they propose only that yoga is one of many paths to self-fulfillment, which in Lanthier's view undermines the film's premise. All the same, he finds that the film \\"examines the astounding diversity and confused historical background of its subject quite well.\\" Walter Addiego, writing on SFGate, calls the film \\"engaging\\" with its \\"breezy title\\".

Description A small gnome with a grey beard and a pointed hat stands at the entrance of a cave at a high altitude. He looks out over a landscape with hills and trees and a town in the distant background. At the foot of a hill, the silhouette of a railway train passes by and pours out grey smoke from the locomotive. Analysis In 2008, the art historian Florian Illies made a comparison to J. M. W. Turner's Rain, Steam and Speed ‚Äì The Great Western Railway (1844), \\"modernity's break-in into art history\\", and interpreted Gnome Watching Railway Train as Spitzweg's self-ironic comment to his reputation as someone who wanted to stop time. According to Illies, Spitzweg's gnome is a caricature of someone who thinks he can watch the modern world come and go from his cave. Analysing the painting in 2018, the German studies scholar Theodore Ziolkowski grouped it with Charles Dickens' novel Dombey and Son (1848), William Wordsworth's poem \\"On the Projected Kendal and Windermere Railway\\" (1844) and several texts by Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff. The railway here symbolises the new technology, which is accepted but also regarded as destructive. Spitzweg's composition, with an elevated figure gazing across a landscape, had previously been used by romantic painters like Caspar David Friedrich, John Constable and Eug√®ne Delacroix. Instead of conveying a romantic message, however, Spitzweg's gnome is humouristic, and the seemingly idyllic painting is ironic. Ziolkowski wrote: \\"No painting could mark more precisely the artist's recognition that the Romanticism in which he began his career has been displaced by the technological developments of the contemporary world‚Äîthe developments that inform his contemporary Biedermeier culture as well as the approaching Realism. The Romantic reverence for art, which it regarded as a substitute for religion, has given way to humor and irony.\\" History Gnome Watching Railway Train was made a decade after the opening of the first railway line in Germany, and the technology had rapidly become commonplace. It was painted with oil on the lid of a cigar box. Provenance The painting has belonged to Spitzweg's nephew-in-law Major Karl Loreck, Hugo Helbing in Munich, E. Ullmann in Vienna, H. Meyer in Munich (from October 1937) and H. E. Martini in Augsburg (from 1951). On 5 April 2008 it was sold at auction for 69,600 euro. Since the 1950s, it has also gone under the name Gnomen (English: Gnomes). This was caused by a mistake from G√ºnther R√∂nnefahrt during his catalogization of Spitzweg's works. R√∂nnefahrt only had access to a black-and-white photograph of the painting and thought he saw a second gnome in the shadows of the cave.

Taking over the aircraft Captain Ronnie Perera and First Officer Ranjit Pedris, started pre-flight checkups. Captain Perera found the cabin untidy and ordered it be cleaned before departure. This delayed the flight, while a cleaner from the ground staff started cleaning the cabin, under Captain Perera directions. Pedris continued the pre-flight checks. Shortly thereafter an explosion rocked the aircraft. Pedris was in the cockpit and exited the aircraft, while Captain Perera and the cleaner exited the aircraft from the rear door. The control tower alerted the emergency services, which responded but faced equipment limitations that prevented them from stopping the fire from destroying the aircraft completely. Had the flight not been delayed for cleaning, the bomb would have detonated mid-flight; the delay likely saved many lives. An immediate cord of the airport was carried out and all passengers from flight from Jaffna was detained and questioned. The Captain Errol Cramer, who had piloted the flight from Jaffna to Colombo had noticed two passengers loitering in the cabin before departing. In the subsequent investigation into the bombing, two men who had traveled in the flight from Jaffna to Colombo were arrested, tried and found guilty of placing a bomb under a seat before leaving the aircraft. They were found to be members of the movement that later became the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

The list is arranged alphabetically by country. The initial dates of the boats correspond to the launch time, followed by a separation that indicates their retirement or final date. The list includes ironclads of two different categories or roles, oceanic and coastal (the latter may be floating batterys, monitors and coastal defence ships). The various ironclads design such as the ram, broadside, central battery (or casemate), turret and barbette will be mentioned. Some of these ocean ironclads can be classified as armored frigates, armored corvettes, or others based on their displacement. Wooden hull ships that have been subsequently armored will also be considered in this list. Although the introduction of the ironclad is clear-cut, the boundary between 'ironclad' and the later 'pre- dreadnought battleship' is less obvious, as the characteristics of the pre- dreadnought evolved from 1875 to 1895.

Most of these warehouses were converted into apartments at the end of 20th century.  History  The Laboean, Bindjeij and Medan warehouses at the Houtmankade were designed by architect Willem Hamer, who also designed some striking 19th- century buildings in Amsterdam, such as the Hotel de l'Europe. The construction of the warehouses started on July 22, 1895. On September 14 in the same year, the construction progressed so far that the founder and director of the Deli Company, Peter Wilhelm Janssen, could lay the foundation stone. In the years 1898-1900 the Deli Company expanded its storage facilities with the adjacent warehouses Serdang, Langkat and Deli (Nova Zemblastraat 8-12). All of these warehouses were used mainly for tobacco storage. In 1897, during the great city expansions of Amsterdam, George Hendrik Breitner recorded the construction pits and piling activities on Van Diemenstraat.Breitner schilderde een Amsterdam in aanbouw‚Äô door Harmen Bockma, 22 oktober 2014, De Volkskrant (Article in Dutch newspaper: Breitner painted Amsterdam under construction) The warehouses Laboean, Bindjeij and Medan near the Westerkanaal and close to the Westerkeersluis (flood barrier) can be seen in the background of these pictures and paintings made by Breitner. The names of the warehouses refer to the locations Medan, Bindjeij (Binjai) and Laboean (Labuhan) in the sultanate of Deli at Sumatra, former Dutch East Indies, and modern day Indonesia, where the Deli Company had their possessions. Since 2003 the three warehouses together are marked as a Rijksmonument, which is officially recorded under registration number 526740.  From warehouse to a residential building  The three warehouses at the Houtmankade were renovated in 1986, where all spaces were converted to units with a residential and / or business function. As part of the renovation, the central part of the Bindjeij was demolished to make way for the courtyard.Bouwarchief Gemeente Amsterdam (Amsterdam City Archives) The rear part of the Bindjeij was converted into a joint stairwell which includes also an elevator. As a result, all units became accessible. The part next to the warehouses, which previously provided direct access to the outside area, was rebuilt as the main entrance of the apartment complex, main hall corridor and additional storage facilities for the apartments. For this reason the main entrance to the complex appears now on the Nova Zemblastraat instead of the Houtmankade. Due to the new main entrance the original house numbers Houtmankade 20-24 were changed into Nova Zemblastraat 2A-6L. Since 2016 all 24 apartments, which are divided over 5 floors, have a residential function.The Netherlands‚Äô Cadastre, Land Registry and Mapping Agency ‚Äì in short Kadaster The warehouses together are called 'De Kleine Houtman' as a distinction from another building 'De Houtman', which is located on the other side of the Nova Zemblastraat. As part of the renovation, the courtyard was decorated with a sculpture ‚Äòthree-dimensional nature fragments‚Äô. This sculpture was designed by the Dutch artist, Ger Zijlstra.  Building characteristics  The different characteristics of the warehouses have been preserved on the outside as well as on the inside. The warehouses are designed in a neo-Renaissance style with elements such as stepped gables (with triangular and semicircular frontons), consoles and decorative bands with yellow brickwork. In terms of type, this storage building fits in with the warehouses from the Dutch Golden Age. Inside, the cast-iron columns, together with the robust wooden beams on which the floors rest, still reinforce the load-bearing structure of the warehouses. The cast-iron columns are finished with (reinforced) concrete for sufficient fire resistance. The wooden rafters that support the roof are still visible in the apartments on the top floor.  Foundation  Since the soil beneath Amsterdam is weak, many buildings in the city are built on wooden pilings. This also applies to these warehouses. A multiple piled beam construction has been applied to ensure foundational stability. The wooden beams were driven into a deeper layer of sand that is solid enough to bear the weight of the building. A stone foundation was built on top of those pilings.amsterdam.nl (housing/foundation- subside) All foundation materials made of wood are located below groundwater level and are water-saturated. This method prevents the wood from containing oxygen, which helps to avoid material degradation. The soil below these warehouses consists mainly of clay with a peat layer of 1 meter thickness at a depth of 5 meters. The first layer of sand with sufficient loading capacity is located between 13.3 and 15.6 meters below ground level.Core sample B25E1948, DINOloket, Data and Information on the Dutch Subsurface The wooden piles are located under the inside and outside walls of the building and underneath the 15 cast-iron columns, which are fitted indoors. The piles are within a short distance (< 20 inches) of each other. In total, nearly 700 piles have been driven into the soil to support all three warehouses.

Although he was never charged with the murders of his first and second spouse, Pruitt eventually killed his last one as well, before opting to end his life to evade justice. Early life and first marriage Pruitt came from an old, but wealthy Protestant family in his hometown of Edinburgh. Described by many as a man with higher than average intelligence, he was considered a respectable member of society. While still a young man, he swooned and soon married a Miss Van Meter, from Rushville, whom gave birth to four children - Alice, Leslie, Ethel and Clyde (all of them later moved to Indianapolis). The family was regarded as an ordinary and happy one, with Pruitt at the helm of it. Murders =First wife= In 1888, the first Mrs. Pruitt suddenly died from poisoning. This event shocked the citizens of Edinburgh, but no suspicion was directed at Pleasant, at all. His seemingly righteous way of living prevented any investigation into the matter, leaving the people to wonder if the death was just a simple accident. Mrs. Pruitt's death remained an unsolved mystery, and Pleasant continued living as a respected and honorable man. =Second wife= A year or two after her death, Pleasant met and married Naomi Huffman. The Pruitt household seemed to have returned to its previous happy state, but not for long. In 1896, the Edinburgh community was shocked yet again, when it was learned that Pleasant had accidentally killed his wife. The grieving farmer explained that he had been cleaning and loading his shotgun in the rear of the house, when the weapon accidentally fired. Naomi, who was in the summer kitchen, was struck and instantaneously killed. This claim did not satisfy the neighbors, who recalled the first wife's death, and demanded that the authorities start an official investigation into the matter. Pruitt was arrested, but since there was no clear motive, and the fact that the couple lived happily together, the jury considered that the two deaths were mere strange coincidences. Pleasant was let go, but the trial had cost him much of his wealth. He began to travel extensively, eventually meeting his soon-to-be-third-wife, Winnie Berry, in Iowa City. The couple stayed there for some years, before moving to Indianapolis and settling on East Ohio Street, along with Winnie's 14-year-old son from a previous marriage, Jesse. =Third wife and suicide= Eventually, Pleasant was left without money, so his wife suggested that they turn their home into a boarding house. The business was going well, but Pruitt, who barely worked, began growing more and more melancholic. His worsening behavior resulted in him having problems with how the house was managed, which caused some boarders to leave, and thus, quarrels between him and his wife began. No longer feeling love towards her, Pleasant began plotting to kill her. On October 9, 1902, not long after Jesse to go to school and after the same old arguing was going on, Winnie went down to the basement to work over a washtub. Pleasant supposedly followed her down there, only to renew their quarreling. In the heat of the moment, he attacked his wife. Grabbing a nearby knife, Pleasant stabbed her twice to the heart, while still hitting her in the face. Winnie's face was horribly disfigured, with both her eyes punched out of their eyesockets. Pruitt left the basement, with the likely intention to escape immediately. For an unknown reason, he returned to the basement with a fully loaded .38 bulldog revolver, and subsequently committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, his body falling on top of his deceased wife. Discovery and aftermath At around 4:30 in the afternoon, Jesse Berry returned from school. When he entered the house, he shouted down the hall to notify his mum that he had returned, but with no response. Puzzled, he went upstairs to continue his search, where one of the roomers, Nicholas Yeager, told him that his mother had been in the basement since the early morning, washing clothes. Jesse then went down to the cellar, yelling out for his mother one last time before entering. Receiving no response yet again, he went down the stairs into the dark basement. After only making a few steps, he stumbled into the feet of his stepfather, and when he struck a match, he saw that his face was all bloodied. Terrified, he ran up the stairs and out the house to the police station. He came across Policemen Morgan and Simon, who bicycled to the house under Jesse's guidance. When Morgan entered the cellar and struck a match, he instantly realised that it was a case of murder‚Äìsuicide. He then returned to the young boy, telling him that a serious accident had occurred, only for the young Jesse to tell him that he knew this was coming and prayed that they were peaceful in Heaven now. The house was quickly investigated and the roomers questioned, with the police unveiling that the Pruitt's constant arguing was the likely motive behind the crime. A few weeks after the whole story, a lawsuit was filed by Frank McCray, administrator of Winnie's estate, versus Otho C. George, administrator of Pleasant's estate. The case was for whom would receive the properties, as they could not be given to a young man like Jesse, and the two men argued over who lived the longer: the victim or the perpetrator. The outcome of this lawsuit is, at present, unknown.

Patients with a bipolar disorder often have for example a less stable and more variable circadian activity. This circadian activity disruption is often also apparent, even if the person concerned isn't currently ill. A decreased need for sleep is a symptom of both a manic episode and a hypomanic episode in bipolar disorder. Sleep disturbances are also very often also a prodrome for the onset of a manic, hypomanic or depressive episode. Current Research on circadian and sleep-wake processes showed that they play an important role in the etiology and maintenance of a bipolar disorder. Previous studies showed, that the circadian system can modulate the current mood state with positive affect. When being challenged on the other hand, it can also have negative consequences on the mood. The social zeitgeber hypothesis therefore proposes, that in bipolar disorder the fundamental circadian instability can be moderated by the stabilization of daily rhythms and zeitgeber. According to the hypothesis a disruption (e.g. life events) could trigger depressive, hypomanic or manic episodes. A regular daily rhythm on the other hand can have a positive effect and lead to a normalization of the circadian system. The goal of treatment programs like the interpersonal and social rhythm therapy therefore is to regulate the social rhythms of a patient and thereby normalize the biological rhythms. REM sleep in bipolar disorder Current research on REM sleep found, that REM sleep is critical in the processing of episodic emotional memories. When the REM sleep activity in patients with a unipolar or bipolar depression were measured, often an increased REM density was found. The increased REM density in unipolar and bipolar depression might have two implications. First, it could represent a failed attempt to depotentiate negative emotional experiences during the sleep. Another possible implication is that the increased REM density may pathologically reinforce negative self-narratives and maintain negative moods after sleeping. Both hypothesis are not yet fully proven but show the importance of sleep and sleep disruptions in bipolar disorder and the need for further research. Sleep disorders and bipolar disorder The diagnosis of a bipolar disorder is linked to various sleep disorders. Mainly it is very comorbid with Insomnia and Hypersomnia. Other related sleep disturbances are for e.g. a delayed sleep phase syndrome, circadian-rhythm sleep disorder, sleep apnea, REM sleep abnormalities and Irregular sleep-wake schedules. The bipolar disorder is also linked with higher rates of suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts. It has been shown, that sleep disturbances can have an influence on the suicidality of patients with a bipolar disorder. One study found, that poor sleep quality and nightmares can increase the risk for suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts. Genetic vulnerability The bipolar disorder is known to have a high heritability. Therefore, sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder could also have a genetic basis. Studies found modest associations between several genes that are known to be associated with the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms and bipolar disorder. Two locus interactions between sleep disturbances of the rs11824092 (ARNTL) and rs11932595 (CLOCK) were found in one study. Sleep disturbances and relapse Sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder are also an important marker for relapse. Multiple studies found evidence, that sleep disturbances contribute to relapse. Sleep disturbances are the most common prodrome of a manic episode and the sixth most common prodrome of a depressive episode. Sleep disturbance as a residual symptom of a bipolar disorder Sleep disturbance is not only associated with the onset of manic or hypomanic episodes but also displays a residual symptom of manic and depressive episodes. They are associated with residual depressive symptoms and perceived cognitive performance and can thereby negatively influence the functioning and recovery of a patient. This is one reason why therapy programs like the Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy aim to reduce sleep disturbances. Treatment possibilities regarding the sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder =Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy= A main goal of interpersonal and social rhythm therapy IPSRT is to regulate both circadian rhythms and sleep‚Äìwake cycles. To achieve this goal maintaining regular daily rhythms in for e.g. exercise, eating, sleeping and waking are central in the IPSRT. Research has shown, that the sleep-wake cycle (circadian rhythms and sleep) can be moderated by social and volitional factors. Based on this chronobiological model IPSRT aims to manage the possible chaos of bipolar disorder symptomatology. =Light therapy for bipolar disorder= A recent study is also suggesting, that the bipolar disorder is linked with an enhanced sensitivity to light. In the study four of the five women who received a midday light session responded well. Three of the four who received light in the morning developed a mixed state, and the other responded well. The authors conclude that light therapy is possibly an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of the bipolar disorder. =Total or partial sleep deprivation= Another proposed treatment for sleep disturbances is total or partial sleep deprivation. Total or partial sleep deprivation has been found to induce an increased mood in depressed bipolar patients. Problematically depressive symptoms often seem to return soon after the patient has slept. Two theories hypothesize, that circadian mechanisms might the reason. According to the internal coincidence model, depressed patients are not sleeping at the right biological clock time because the phase angle between the sleep-wake cycle and the biological clock is out of alignment. Based on this theory sleep deprivation works at first because it prevents sleep at the critical phase but in recovery sleep, the misalignment is reinstated. In the two process model of sleep, it has been proposed, that depression is characterized by a deficiency in the building up of process S. Therefore, sleep deprivation might increase process S in the beginning, but a relapse occurs, when sleep deprivations isn't applied anymore and process S returns to a low level.

The hospital today has 600 beds and is presently a superspeciality tertiary care hospital offering comprehensive care covering all major clinical specialities and most super-specialities. The institution started as a dispensary in 1876 by the Delhi Female Medical Mission, on the banks of river Yamuna. The hospital was later established in 1885 as a small facility with 50 beds in Chandni Chowk and opened by Lady Dufferin, Vicereine of India. It was the first hospital for women and children. Old Hospital Building  Education  St. Stephen's Hospital was the first one to begin training the Indian women as nurses in 1867. The training School for nurses was started under Alice Wilkinson‚Äîthe first trained British nurse who joined the hospital in 1908. Wilkinson became the hospital's nursing superintendent. She also founded the Trained Nurse's Association of India and worked as its secretary until 1948. The first school of nursing in India was started much later in 1871 at Government General Hospital, Chennai. The hospital is also one of the major teaching hospitals offering speciality and superspeciality courses affiliated to the National Board of Examinations and recognized by the Medical Council of India. The hospital also won the national award from the National Board of Examinations for the excellence in teaching in the Diplomate of National Board programme The hospital also trains laboratory technicians to perform standardized Hemophilia tests under the aegis of Hemophilia Federation of India  Research  St Stephen's Hospital, Delhi The hospital has a rich tradition contributing to research and knowledge advancing healthcare.

The hospital also contributed to the World Health Organization Trauma Care Checklist Program Care Process Measures. An active research group works in the area of gestational diabetes and Rheumatology. The organisation is recognized by Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India.  History  The hospital was started as 50 bedded facility in Chandni Chowk , overlooking Queen's Gardens now known as Company Bagh way back in 1885 as a hospital for women and children. It was the dream of the Delhi Female Medical Mission to operate in a hospital. The St. Stephen's Hospital for Women and Children was founded in memory of Priscilla Winter, founder of Delhi Female Medical Mission In the late 1890s, the Mission's treated around 600-700 patients in the new hospital, 15,000 at the dispensaries, and 1,200 through home visits Commemorative centenary first day cover released in 1985 The hospital was centrally located in old Delhi and was the first hospital solely dedicated to the care of women and children in Delhi.

She started flying herself in 1929. After becoming the country's first female director of an aircraft company in 1936, she died serving with the Air Transport Auxiliary in 1940, becoming the first female British aviator to die in World War II.  Early life  Davison was born Elsie Joy Muntz on 14 March 1910 in Toronto, Ontario. After her father died in an accident when she was young, she moved with her mother and sister to the United Kingdom. Interested in aviation and mechanics since childhood, she started flying in 1929 and gained her flying certificate by age 20. By the time she was 23, she was already a well-known pilot in her local area. Davison was recorded holding a \\"Commercial B\\" license from the Air Ministry. She was a member of the Women's Engineering Society and first worked at De Havilland and several other companies as a mechanic before starting to fly for the Comper Aircraft Company.  Marriage and commercial activity  In 1933, she married William Frank Davison (1899‚Äì1949) who she met while flying him for his photography work for the Liverpool Dock Board. Frank bought Hooton Airfield in 1934 and founded Utility Airways Ltd. there in 1936, with both him and his wife as directors, making her the United Kingdom's first female aircraft company director. The pair divorced in 1939 and Frank would then go on to marry English sailor Ann Davison. That year, Davison worked for a company flying from Portsmouth to Cardiff. When World War II broke out, she started working for National Air Communications (NAC). When she learned about the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), she wrote to Pauline Gower to inquire about working there but turned a first offer down because the pay was too low.  Air Transport Auxiliary service and death  Davison trained and crashed with a Miles Master Mk. I (example pictured) After the expansion of the ATA and bored with her job at the NAC, Davison decided to join the women's section of the Air Transport Auxiliary on 1 July 1940. The ATA was tasked with transporting newly produced aircraft from the factories to their respective Royal Air Force bases. She went to Central Flying School in Upavon and was assigned an experienced instructor named Sergeant Francis L'Estrange. Davison and L'Estrange took flight on 8 July 1940 in a Miles Master but on their return to base, the aircraft made a spiral dive and crashed into the ground to the shock of spectators who did not believe anything was wrong until the crash. Both Davison and L'Estrange died during this instruction flight, making Davison the country's first aviatrix to die during World War II. Contemporary sources speculated that carbon monoxide had leaked into the cockpit and rendered both pilots unconscious prior to the crash but no official reason for the crash was ever given.

Four police officers including Inspector Bastianpillai were killed by the LTTE members led by Uma Maheswaran.  Background  In December 1977 M. Canagaratnam, Member of Parliament from Pottuvil crossed over to the government, joining the United National Party from the Tamil United Liberation Front. In response, Uma Maheswaran and LTTE members visited Canagaratnam's home in Kollupitiya, Colombo and shot him several times. Although he survived the shooting, he died of his injuries on 20 April 1980. The attempted murder was investigated by a team of detectives from the Criminal Investigation Department lead by the Tamil Inspector of Police T.L.B. Bastianpillai who headed the CID TULF desk which monitored activities of the Tamil parties following the assassination of Alfred Duraiappah. Bastianpillai was considered as one of the best CID officers at the time and had been charged with security of the visiting heads of states to the 1976 Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Colombo. He was assisted by Sub Inspector Perampalan who was also a Tamil. In April 1978, Bastianpillai and Perampalan received information that Uma Maheswaran was hiding in a farm in the middle of the jungle in Murunkan.  Massacre  On 7 April 1978, the team of police officers consisting of Bastianpillai, Perampalan, Police Sergeant Balasingham and Police Constable (Driver) Sriwardene reached the location in a police car. The farm had been a training camp for the LTTE. The police team disembarked from the car and approached what seemed to be laborers standing near a well. They didn't know that Maheswaran and several others were hiding in a tree overlooking the well. Bastianpillai questioned the identities of men. He was then offered water to drink putting down his sub-machine gun. One of the men posing off as laborers was Sellakili, an LTTE member who knocked Bastianpillai in the head and took his sub-machine gun shooting, Bastianpillai and Sergeant Balasingham killing them both before they could react. Perampalan attempted to shoot back but was shot and wounded, falling into the well, where he was shot dead by Sellakili. Constable Sriwardene who attempted to escape on foot was thereafter gun- downed.LTTE investigators become UNP suspects Bastianpillai's body was mutilated and dumped into the well with the bodies of the other policeman. The weapons of the police officers were collected, including Balasingham's sub- machine gun. It was the first sub-machine gun acquired by the Tamil militancy. The radio was removed and the police car was set on fire after it was driven further away.  Aftermath  The Bastianpillai's superiors became concerned with his sudden disappearance, as he had not informed of his movements to them. Several days later the police received information about dead bodies in a well in the jungles around Murunkan. A police team investigating this report found the badly decomposed bodies of the policemen, identifying them to be of Bastianpillai and his team. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam claimed responsibility of the killing of 9 police officers including Bastianpillai in late April via TULF. This sent shock-waves across the country and shocked the government as Bastianpillai was its lead investigator in to the Tamil militancy. The LTTE in the following months assassinated more Tamil police officers investigating the Tamil militancy included the killing of Jaffna Headquarters Inspector Pathmanathan and Inspector Kumar, who had retired after serving as the Personal Assistant to the Superintendent of Police, Jaffna. Sellakili became an LTTE leader and was killing ambushing the army patrol Four Four Bravo.

He was also a regular guest conductor of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande's summer concerts. His compositions include the opera Die Richterin and the oratorio Clameurs du monde. Life and career Pantillon was born in La Chaux-de-Fonds to a musical family. His great-grandfather Zacharie was a violinist who had studied in Berlin under Joseph Joachim and was active in the musical life of La Chaux- de-Fonds, organizing concerts which brought Saint-Sa√´ns, Massener, and other prominent musicians to the city. His grandfather Georges-Albert was the author of a textbook on solf√®ge which was widely used in the French-speaking schools of Switzerland. His father Georges-Louis (1896-1992), also a violinist and composer, was one of the founders of the Coll√®ge musical de La Chaux-de-Fonds (originally known as the Soci√©t√© Suisse de P√©dagogie Musicale) and served as its director from 1947 to 1978. Taught by his father, Pantillon received his first diploma in violin in 1948. He then went to the Royal Conservatory of Brussels where he studied composition, violin, and conducting. At the conservatory he won the First Prize with Distinction in harmony in 1951. The following year he won the First Prize with Distinction in counterpoint, and the First Prize in violin, studying under Carlo Van Neste. He received his diploma in conducting in from the conservatory 1954 and had further studies in conducting under Paul van Kempen at Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena and with Franco Ferrara in Hilversum. On his return to Switzerland, he began an active career as a conductor and composer. He directed the city choirs of Neuch√¢tel, Berne, and Biel and from 1986 to 2011 he was the musical director of the City Orchestra of Thun. He was also a regular guest conductor of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande's summer concerts as well making appearances as a guest conductor at international music festivals in Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, England, and Poland. From the early 1960s to the early 1980s he composed around 80 choral pieces and cantatas in the style of Swiss composers such as Gustave Doret, Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, and . He later adopted a more avant-garde style which grew out of his friendship with Krzysztof Penderecki. Other influences on his later style, which had moved from tonality to polytonality, were Olivier Messiaen and Arthur Honegger. From the early 1980s his compositions were virtually all inspired by his Christian faith and a sense of mysticism. The only exception was his 1991 opera Die Richterin, based on the novella of the same name by Conrad Ferdinand Meyer. After the 1998 premiere of his sinfonietta Imaginaire Couleur de Ciel, Pantillion composed very little for the next ten years. He retired from active conducting in 2013 but returned to composing after what he termed his \\"ten-year crisis\\". In 2015 his concerto for violin and orchestra La clairi√®re, inspired by Alberto Giacometti's sculpture of the same name, was premiered by the Bienne Symphony Orchestra at La Chaux-de-Fonds. In his later years, Pantillon has lived in Lugnorre, near Haut-Vully in the canton of Fribourg. He has seven children from his three marriages. References Further reading *De Aguiar, Renato (2002).

He pioneered the application of optical methods to problems in cell physiology and neuroscience that he developed with Cohen. He was a primary participant in all of the experiments that resulted in the discovery of the probes that enabled functional imaging. This was quickly followed by the first optical recording of action potentials from individual neurons, and then the first multiple site optical recording of membrane voltage. This achievement paved the way for much of the functional imaging of the nervous system that has followed. Salzberg and Cohen implemented the first combined visualization of neuronal electrical activity with morphology. This approach afforded an unprecedented level of discourse between morphology and physiology, a crucial step in integrative neuroscience. Together with their colleagues, they also introduced imaging of specific intracellular ion changes. By using the calcium sensor Arsenazo III in squid axon, together with J.E. Brown and colleagues, they established what would be the first link between membrane potential and second messenger activation. Other contributions include the first recording of electrical activity and the first characterization of the ionic basis of the action potential in mammalian nerve terminals and, together with Grinvald, the first intracellular staining with voltage-sensitive dyes. Salzberg also discovered and characterized the large fast changes in light scattering from mammalian nerve terminals that are related to secretion, and he also detected robust intrinsic fluorescence changes from nerve terminals. Salzberg is also credited with Ana Lia Obaid for the first multiple-site optical recording with single cell resolution from a mammalian neural network. With Obaid and Thomas D. Parsons, he was the first to monitor effective connectivity patterns in ensembles of identified invertebrate neurons in culture in 1989. Working with Stephan Rohr, Salzberg showed the dependence of impulse conduction on the geometry of the underlying excitable tissue using photolithographically patterned growth heart cell cultures. He also detected extremely rapid mechanical \\"spikes\\" in nerve terminals using high bandwidth atomic force microscopy and he reported the first two-photon recording of the action potential from individual mammalian terminals in situ. He made the discovery of the first sensitive molecular probe of the membrane potential, with H. Vicencio Davila and Cohen, the first optical recording of action potentials from neurons and the first multiple site optical recording of membrane potential, the first optical recording of electrical activity from gland cells and, with Francisco Bezanilla, the optical measurement of the series resistance in squid giant axons. He was also responsible for the first optical recording from cerebellar slices, the first measurement of extracellular K accumulation in the cerebellum (with Arthur Konnerth and Obaid), and the first optical recording of electrical activity in olfactory bulb dendrites with A. Cinelli. He was the first to monitor effective connectivity patterns in cultured ensembles of identified invertebrate neurons, and with M. Muschel, he made the first millisecond time resolved measurements of Ca dynamics in mammalian nerve terminals. Salzberg also introduced the use of high power LEDs as ultra-stable light sources for physiological measurements.  Athletics  Salzberg is a long distance runner who completed 21 marathons between 1973 and 2007 including 7 Boston Marathons and 4 NYC Marathons. Between 1977 and 1992, he finished 7 marathons, never slower than 2:58:20 and mostly in the low 2:50's. He is one of the four men who have completed every Falmouth Road Race from its inception in 1973 with a PR of 40:40.

The film's music was composed by Emmy-nominated film composer Gil Talmi. The Great Hack premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival in the Documentary Premieres section and was released by Netflix on July 24, 2019. The documentary focuses on Professor David Carroll of Parsons and The New School, Brittany Kaiser (former business development director for Cambridge Analytica), and British investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr. Their stories interweave to expose the work of Cambridge Analytica in the politics of various countries, including the United Kingdom's Brexit campaign and the 2016 United States elections.  Background  SCL Group was a private research and strategic communications company interested in studying and influencing mass behavior. With alleged expertise in psychological operations (psyops), the company worked in military and political operations around the world in the late 1990s, including electioneering in the developing world throughout the early 2000s. To do business involving US elections, the subsidiary Cambridge Analytica was formed in 2012. In 2015, Cambridge Analytica, a UK-based political consulting firm, began working on behalf of Ted Cruz's campaign to win the 2016 US Republican nomination. It used Facebook as a means for \\"political-voter surveillance\\" through the collection of user data points. Independent investigations into data mining, along with whistle- blower accounts of the firm's impact on Brexit, led to a scandal over the influence of social media in political elections. In the film, the Cambridge Analytica scandal is examined through the eyes of several involved persons.  The scandal  Cambridge Analytica, the firm responsible for the scandal, was dedicated to big data. The data which was collected was meant to be used as part of a sales strategy that involved creating massive campaigns that approached users in a personal manner. The results of this campaign ended up disrupting US and UK politics and led to claims of complicity of social media enterprises such as Facebook. The illicit harvesting of personal data by Cambridge Analytica was first reported in December 2015 by Harry Davies, a journalist for The Guardian. He reported that Cambridge Analytica was working for United States Senator Ted Cruz and used data harvested from millions of people's Facebook accounts without their consent. Facebook refused to comment on the story other than to say it was investigating. Further reports followed in the Swiss publication Das Magazin by Hannes Grasseger and Mikael Krogerus (December 2016), (later translated and published by Vice), Carole Cadwalladr in The Guardian (starting in February 2017) and Mattathias Schwartz in The Intercept (March 2017). Brittany Kaiser, former director of Business Development at Cambridge Analytica, revealed that everything published involving Cambridge Analytica in the Brexit campaign and Ted Cruz's campaign was true. The scandal reached a point where even Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, had to testify officially in front of several committees of the United States Congress.  Synopsis  When Cambridge Analytica's former CEO Alexander Nix was exposed on Channel 4 as claiming to have 5,000 data points on every American voter, Professor David Carroll took notice. He undertook a legal journey to try to reclaim his data with the help of lawyer Ravi Naik of ITN Solicitors, an expert on data privacy in the United Kingdom. Because Cambridge Analytica processed user data via SCL in Britain, Carroll's complaints fell under British jurisdiction. On July 4, 2017, Carroll filed a complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) of the UK. As a result, SCL was fined ¬£15,000 for a lack of compliance with the ICO. Also, as a result, Facebook paid ¬£500,000 for a \\"lack of transparency and security issues relating to the harvesting of data constituting\\" in the related scandal. During Carroll's legal battle, SCL filed for bankruptcy. Cambridge Analytica's work was found to violate UK privacy laws. The ICO released a statement saying, \\"Had SCLE still existed in its original form, our intention would have been to issue the company with a substantial fine for severe breaches of principle one of the DPA1998 for unfairly processing people's data for political purposes including purposes connected with the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaigns.\\" While David Carroll's journey unfolds, the investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr continues her work into the influence of Cambridge Analytica. This work leads her to a whistle-blower, Christopher Wylie, who explains how microtargeting, combined with mass- harvesting of data, was used to influence elections. Cadwalladr's exclusive interviews with Wylie in The Observer reveal how psychographic profiling tactics were carried out with user data scraped from Facebook with the help of Cambridge University professor Aleksandr Kogan. These allegations take the Cambridge Analytica scandal public and lead Wylie to testifying in the UK Parliament and mentioning the name of a former director at Cambridge Analytica, Brittany Kaiser. A polarizing yet essential part of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Wylie penned a tell-all called Mindf*ck in 2019. The filmmakers track down Brittany Kaiser in Thailand, where she considers becoming a whistle-blower and making information about Cambridge Analytica public, or dodging press inquiries and questions. With the help of British- born social entrepreneur, writer, and organizer Paul Hilder, she decides to go back to Washington DC, to come clean. With the help of specific documents from her personal Cambridge Analytica archives, Kaiser explains the effective micro-targeting of unsuspecting individuals, whom she calls \\"persuadable\\", by Cambridge Analytica in the 2016 US elections.

It is located in new buildings at Mount Oswald on Elvet Hill to the south of Durham City, adjoining Van Mildert College and the new site of John Snow College.  History  The site was originally part of the grounds of Mount Oswald, a country house built in 1800. In 1928, the house and grounds were converted to a golf club, which closed in 2014 and was acquired for residential development. In August 2017, Durham University announced that it had acquired part of the site in order to build two colleges, with construction to be carried out by a consortium led by Interserve. Construction began in September 2018, by which point it had been decided that these colleges would be one new college, South College, and a new home for John Snow College (formerly located on the university's Queen's Campus in Stockton-on-Tees). In November 2018, Interserve pulled out of the scheme, before going into administration in March 2019. The college is anticipated to have an eventual size of 1200, with 492 living in the college. All accommodation is self-catered, in a mixture of single en-suite rooms and 'town houses' with shared bathroom facilities. In March 2018, it was announced that naming of the college would be delayed in the hope that a financial donation might be attracted. The temporary name \\"South College\\" was assigned pending selection of a final name, and was used in advertisements for the new college's first principal. In June 2019, Durham Students' Union assembly voted to lobby for the college to be named after the late politician and Durham graduate Mo Mowlam. On 1 April 2020, Durham's student newspaper Palatinate published an April Fools' Day joke that South College was to be named Vine College after broadcaster and Durham alumnus Jeremy Vine. Vine himself was in on the joke and even released a video of him reacting to the 'announcement'. The actual name of the college is yet to be confirmed.

The sonata is considered, along with Telemann's Fantasias for Solo Flute and J. S. Bach's A minor partita, one of the most significant works for unaccompanied flute before the 20th century. It is the sole flute work by Bach that was printed and published during his lifetime. No manuscript of it has been discovered.  History  Bach wrote this sonata in Berlin around 1747, when he was a chamber harpsichordist of Frederick the Great. The king was also a flutist, and had many composers write flute compositions for him. Bach devoted several compositions to the flauto traverso. In 1747, he composed a series of works for the instrument, including this sonata. Some scholars claim that this sonata was intended for the king. Indeed, it was printed during the king's lifetime. But at the time, compositions written for the Prussian king were not permitted to be published and made public. It may have been published without the king's knowledge. This may explain the publication date of 1763, nearly two decades after the sonata was written. Today, for various practical reasons, there are also editions that add an accompaniment, for example a piano.  Description  = Style = The time this sonata was written, was a time that Bach, because of his position as an harpsichordist of the King, was surrounded by many well- established musicians, like Johann Joachim Quantz, the king's personal flute teacher and one of his many composers. Influenced by them, Bach's style changed: besides signs of his father's Baroque style, he included features of the new galant style, such as slow harmonic motion. He continued to use ornaments, which plenty of them exist in his work, in a combination of all the styles of this period (French, German and Italian). Also, in this particular sonata, Bach used the silence technique, leaving twice an entire measure without notes (Movement 1, measure 91, and movement 3, measure 93), so, as there is no accompanying instruments, in these two measures, there is complete silence. This sonata is an early prototype of this change. upright The biggest difference with his father's only work for unaccompanied flute, the Partita in A minor, BWV 1013, a suite of four dance movements (Allemande, Corrente, Sarabande, Bouree anglaise), are that in the sonata, there is nearly no indication of dance (except the second movement), and its three movements (Poco adagio, Allegro, Allegro) do not follow the standard format of fast‚Äìslow‚Äìfast, but slow‚Äìfast‚Äìfast, a format also shown in eleven more of his sonatas between 1735 and 1747. This format reflects the trends of this time in German culture. = Structure = The sonata uses the slow‚Äìfast‚Äìfast movement format. The tempo unifies the work. The first movement is slow (Poco adagio), and the second is faster (Allegro), the third (Allegro) is slightly more faster than the second, so the result, when played, is unified acoustically. Bach also used motivic development to unify his work, as his father did. Examples are the \\"scalar arch\\" motif in the first measures, repeated in fragments in the whole sonata, and the descending half-step motif, which appears at the beginning of every movement. The melodic line seems more angular than soft, as it is clear from the use of sixteenth notes in the Allegro movements, broken chords, thirds and frequent rests, all of them a mix of Baroque and Galant style. = Movements = All movements are written in rounded-binary form.  First movement (Poco adagio)  Meter: 3/8 The first movement, marked Poco adagio, has a similar style as J. S. Bach's similar works. The movement starts with a scalar theme, which itself expresses sadness. Inside it, there are some \\"half-step\\" motifs, which represent tear, and it begins with some slurs, adding in the momentum of the work. In measures 25‚Äì30 and 80‚Äì85, Bach made the melody sound like three different voices, an impressive achievement of the composer. In the measure 30, he added a cadence in a diminished F7 chord, followed in measure 37 by a cadence in C major, which ends with a diminished chord of c7. In measure 41, a cadence in D minor develops, while in the next measure, the harmony modulates to E minor. In measures 50 and 71, the main theme appears again, the second time in the tonic key (A minor), thus creating the unity needed in the rounded-binary form. In measure 81, there is another one cadence that is similar to the one of the measure 30, increasing the musical tension, while the last cadence, in measure 93, is the biggest of the others (but still brief), needing one flutist's breath. As so, having a dominant position, it delays the dissolution further.  Second movement (Allegro)  Meter: 2/4 The second movement is seen by some as developing several mid-century elements about Allegro movements. With a seasoning of wide leaps and swift modulations, some think it is again closer to some of J.S.Bach's compositions. In the first measures, there is an eighth note, suggesting dancing, the reality is that the entering movement is in fact a dancing movement. Nearly in the measure 40, the harmony moves to C major. Two more occasions that the music sounds like it is many voices, while it is only one, is at measures 57‚Äì61 and 104‚Äì108. In measure 76, a cadence starts, but on the same measure and until measure 84, there is a part with notes under legatos, which seems identical to the style of the first movement, employing the same \\"half-step\\" motif. In the same place, there is exemplified one of the unifying motifs found in the sonata. A little later, quick arpeggios appear, changing the scheme. This leads, in measures 85‚Äì93, to a half-cadence filled with sixteenth-notes. The movement closes with a variation of the main theme.  Third movement (Allegro)  Meter: 3/8 The final movement is faster and more difficult than the other two. The movement has the slowest harmonic line and the fewest chromanticism of the entire work, however, it also deploys the most technical features of the entire work. The opening theme of the movement, which contains a part of the opening movement of the first movement, reminds of a rocket rising, again using motivic development (particularly diminution and retrograde). The harmony moves to E minor in the measure 52. There is high tension in the movement until measures 91‚Äì93, where a two-measure C major arpeggio stops suddenly, followed by a measure-wide rest. After that, the theme suddenly seems like a Baroque-era corrente movement. On it, in the measures 95‚Äì101, there is the longer scalar motif of the entire sonata, full with sixteenth notes. After the final section of the work starts in measure 102, a cadence appears at measures 136‚Äì137, bringing back the original tempo. The movement ends with a bold passage.

Arriving in Australia, at a time when there was little technical knowledge of the iron industry in the colonies, Hughes became an influential figure, especially as he was self confident in his own abilities, a tireless worker, and an avid self-promoter. While he was associated with many iron industry ventures‚Äîboth successful and unsuccessful ones‚Äîhe is remembered particularly for his time at the Eskbank Ironworks. During his career, he constructed three colonial-era iron-smelting blast furnaces; at Mittagong (1863‚Äì64)‚Äîthe first in Australia‚Äî at Lithgow (1875), and at Onehunga, New Zealand (1890). He also erected several iron rolling mills‚Äîincluding the first one in Australia to enter commercial production, in 1860‚Äîin both Australia and New Zealand. He seems to have been less successful as a works manager and businessman, with some of his efforts ending in financial losses and in great acrimony. He was also a significant figure in the brickmaking industry of New South Wales. Later in the 19th century, when the industry required more scientific and engineering knowledge, 'practical men' like Hughes became less appreciated and less influential.  Early life in England  Enoch Hughes was born at Dudley, in what was then Worcestershire and is now West Midlands, England, in 1829. He was apprenticed to an ironworks at fourteen, spending the next fourteen years working in the English iron industry. Hughes stated that he had worked at the Bloomfield Ironworks of BBH, at Tipton, and Chillington, Lea Brooke, Bilston Forge, and Spring Vale Ironworks, near Wolverhampton. He migrated to Australia in 1857, arriving in Melbourne in January 1858.  Australia  By 1858, no iron was being made in Australia but there was an accumulation of scrap iron. Hughes saw the opportunity to rework scrap iron into bars. In partnership with Benjamin Marks, he set up the Victoria Rolling Mill and Iron Fencing Company, in Dudley St., West Melbourne, which opened in June 1860. Although this was the second mill erected‚Äîthe first was at the Fitzroy Iron Works in 1857‚Äîthe Victoria Rolling Mill was the first iron rolling mill in Australia to enter commercial production. The partnership with Marks ended soon afterwards, in August 1860, probably leaving Hughes with inadequate financial backing for the venture. From 1860 to mid-1862, Hughes was winning tenders for ironwork, including wrought-iron fencing for the Melbourne Botanic Gardens and a grate for Pentridge Prison. The works were sold and‚Äîwithout Hughes‚Äîcontinued in successful operation for many decades. Hughes became involved in partnership to erect a plant to roll sheet iron in Melbourne. Land, on the south bank of the Yarra River, was granted for this purpose. Hughes fell into dispute with his partner, which led to legal proceedings that ended in June 1862. The sheet iron works was never built. By October 1862, Enoch Hughes was already the works manager of the Fitzroy Iron Works, at Mittagong, N.S.W. before those works were leased to Benjamin Wright Lattin. Lattin agreed to construct a blast furnace‚Äîcapable of producing 120 to 150 tons of iron per week‚Äîat his own cost, in exchange for shares in the company. Lattin chose Hughes to supervise the construction of the furnace. It seems likely, however, that Hughes had been working to interest Lattin in providing the financial backing for the venture‚Äîsince late 1862 at least‚Äîwith the prospect of a contract for 10,000 tons of iron rails as the key incentive. During construction of the blast furnace, to provide cash flow, scrap iron was purchased and rerolled into bars. Hughes had left England at a time when blast furnace technology was changing rapidly, and he had not kept his knowledge current. The blast furnace that he constructed for Lattin was an old fashioned design‚Äîcold blast with an open top‚Äîsimilar to a Scottish design of the 1830s. Hughes used fire-bricks that were made from fire-clay found on the site of the works. Building the furnace had financially ruined Lattin. When the furnace was first lit in July 1864‚ÄîHughes had left by March‚Äîit proved to be a failure. It made only about 80 tons of iron, before it was reconfigured as a hot-blast furnace by the next manager, Joseph Kaye Hampshire. It was, nonetheless, the first blast furnace in Australia, and, after modification, it operated successfully, from May 1865 to January 1866, and again‚Äîwith further modifications‚Äî from February 1876 to March 1877. Hughes went back to the works in May 1865, just after hot-blast operation commenced‚Äîprobably to learn something about the operation‚Äîbut was ejected forcefully. Hughes attempted to disassociate himself from the failures of his time there, later denying‚Äîat least once‚Äîthat he was ever the manager of the Fitzroy works. Hughes moved to Sydney, where he set up the City Iron Works at Pyrmont for its owner, Alexander Brown, and worked again with Lattin who was the manager. He left this enterprise, he later stated, because he was not offered a share in the company's ownership. This venture initially reworked scrap iron, rolling into it into metal bars, but later for a time also puddling imported pig-iron; it operated successfully for many years at Pyrmont, relocating to Alexandria in 1938 and still in business in the 1950s. In November 1864, a charge of bigamy against Hughes‚Äîapparently based upon the evidence of his own brother‚Äîwas dropped; it seems that his first wife had indeed died before he remarried. By March 1865, he had erected the Balmain Fire Brick and Clay Works and was trading as ‚ÄòMessrs. Hughes and Son'. Hughes was made bankrupt for the first time, in August 1865. A statement that he made under oath during his bankruptcy hearing, about his father's control of the brickmaking venture, led to Hughes's committal and trial on a charge of perjury in December 1865. He was convicted and sentenced to two year's imprisonment with hard labour, which he served at Port Macquarie Gaol. His sentence was remitted and, upon release, he returned to the Fitzroy Iron Works. While Hughes had been imprisoned, his father (Moses Hughes) and a partner (Drury) had opened a brickworks, on the Burwood Estate near Newcastle, a highly successful enterprise that lasted into the 1980s. In October 1867, under the pseudonym \\"E.H.\\", he wrote the first of a series of letters to newspapers extolling Newcastle, N.S.W., as a location for an iron works, complete with estimates of production costs. Newcastle would indeed later become the site of a successful steelworks, in 1915. A later letter written by Hughes on the same theme, in 1872, influenced the formation of the Tasmanian Charcoal Iron Company to mine and smelt iron ore in Northern Tasmania. Enoch Hughes and his brother leased the puddling furnaces and rolling mill of the Fitzroy Iron Works between February and June 1868. They puddled left over pig- iron, then shingled and rolled it. While there, Hughes rolled the first plate rolled in Australia, and claimed to have rolled the first rails. The venture was not profitable. It was soon after this that Enoch Hughes is first recorded as being interested in solving the problem of smelting New Zealand iron-sand. In early 1869, Hughes returned to brickmaking, becoming manager of Goodsell and Tye's brickworks at Newtown in Sydney and he was for a short time a partner in this venture In February 1870, Hughes was released from bankruptcy, and by late 1871 was operating the Enmore Pressed Brick Company. He also was an agent for his father's brickworks. However, he retained his ambition to set up an iron industry, shifting his attention to the iron ore, coal and limestone deposits near Wallerawang. But apparently he fell out with his partners in this potential iron-making venture, and they held the lease over the ore-bearing land at Piper's Flat. The site near Wallerawang was, in the eyes of experts at the time, a uniquely promising location for an iron and steelworks, but, despite some later attempts, nothing was ever built there. Ironworks at Lithgow c. 1880, around the time that Enoch Hughes was manager. The blast furnace built by Hughes is on the right and appears to be operating, meaning the date is 1882 or earlier. In July 1874, Hughes and others took out a lease on some land at Lithgow. By November 1874, he was already at work preparing to make the bricks needed for furnaces of an ironworks at Lithgow. This time, the venture was able to obtain some important and influential shareholders, particularly James Rutherford, John Sutherland (N.S.W Minister for Public Works), Daniel Williams, and Thomas Denny (owner of the Denison Foundry in Bathurst), resulting in the establishment of the Lithgow Valley Iron Company (later the Eskbank Ironworks) at Lithgow. Hughes' blast furnace at Lithgow was quite similar in concept to the design that he had used at Fitzroy iron Works, with an 'open-top' and initially cold-blast, but of a stronger cylindrical design bound in iron. Hughes had once again built a blast furnace of an antiquated design; it was not converted to hot blast until 1877. Hughes was later to boast that he had designed and erected this furnace himself and ‚Äúnever paid an engineer or a draftsman a shilling in my life‚Äù. Despite these deficiencies, the furnace made iron‚Äîjust 400 tons from 28 November 1875 until its first shutdown in February 1876‚Äîwell enough that the company later added puddling furnaces and rolling mills, to enable it to make bar iron and rails. The company won contracts to make rails, and to reroll old iron rails into new ones. However, as works manager, Hughes embarrassed the company, when he clashed with the government's inspector Thomas Bladen over product quality, and was caught out clumsily covering up defects in tramway rails by Bladen. In 1881‚Äì1882, Hughes was in a state of dispute, with the other partners who were manoeuvering to buy him out and be rid of him. Hughes' blast furnace at the Eskbank Ironworks finally closed in 1882, and it is reported that James Rutherford‚Äîto avoid the temptation to ever reopen it‚Äîused two dray-loads of blasting powder to blow it up, in the dead of night. Hughes had left Lithgow, by September 1883, and was made bankrupt, for the second time, in May 1884. For four months in 1886, Enoch Hughes worked as a manager for William Sandford, who took a lease on the Fitzroy Iron Works at Mittagong in March 1886, in order to re-roll scrapped iron rails under a contract to the NSW Government that he shared with the Eskbank Iron Works at Lithgow. Production commenced in August 1886, ending after nine months, when Sandford took the work to the Eskbank Ironworks. Hughes had engaged in a debate‚Äîvia letters to newspapers in August‚ÄìSeptember 1885‚Äîwith W. M. Foote, lecturer on iron and steel to the Board of Technical Education. In December 1886, Sandford defended Hughes against criticism of his earlier career and abilities (by Foote), saying, ‚ÄúDo not let us despise the day of small things, or sneer at such men as Enoch Hughes and others, for their efforts. Is it not better to be men who have tried against great odds, and apparently failed than those who have never made an effort\\".  New Zealand  Perhaps more wary of operating a business while a bankrupt‚Äîfor a second time‚Äîin New South Wales, Hughes went to New Zealand. In July 1887 Hughes was reported to be in treaty to buy the Onehunga Ironworks The Onehunga Ironworks had been founded in 1883, to smelt New Zealand's plentiful iron-sand, by a direct reduction method. The venture had failed to prosper after the works' American manager, who had the smelting expertise, was sent to prison for attempted murder. Operations continued, but had ceased completely in March 1887. Hughes took over as manager of the Onehunga works in August 1887, contracted to erect and operate the rolling mills. Hughes apparently was also confident that he could solve the daunting problem of smelting iron-sand. His original plan was to mix the ironsand with hematite ore (from Kamo near Whangarai.) and smelt this mixture. By later in 1887, this had changed to making iron bars, using iron made from scrap iron with a 20% iron-sands admixture. He brought some experienced iron-workers from Lithgow and, like the Eskbank works at Lithgow, operated Onehunga as a 'co- operative'. Under his management the works was expanded in 1889 to make galvanised corragated iron. Auckland Museum. Cropped from the original image.) Hughes expressed complete confidence that he could smelt the iron- sands profitably, but it seems that he only ever did so experimentally and on a small scale. In June 1889, he said that the works had made iron entirely from iron-sand. Hughes position on the technology of iron-sand smelting seems to have been that direct reduction would not work‚Äîat least on a commercial scale‚Äîand only a blast furnace could be successful. This is the opposite to the modern practice in iron-sand smelting. Hughes was backing the wrong approach. In July 1889, a blast furnace was under construction at Onehunga. The furnace made its first pig-iron, in July 1890. It seems that the iron was made with conventional iron ore not iron-sand. Hughes never achieved his goal of smelting iron-sand commercially; he had grossly underestimated the technical difficulties in smelting NZ iron-sand. In early September 1890, the furnace was 'allowed to cool' as a result of insufficient coal, due to industrial trouble at the mines. In late October 1890, Hughes was advocating the erection of a blast furnace at Kamo near Whangarai, where there was a hematite iron ore deposit with coal and limestone nearby. He was openly stating that Onehunga could not compete with a works at Kamo. His grand plans for Kamo came to nothing. By December 1890, he had been sacked by Onehunga and was suing the company and a little later was trying to dispose of his shares in it.  Final years in Australia  Hughes returned to Australia, where his certificate releasing him from bankruptcy had been issued in October 1891. In September 1892, Hughes was made general manager of The Australian Gas Retort and Firebrick Manufacturing Company, of South Yarra, in Melbourne. Enoch Hughes died on 10 April 1893 at his house in South Yarra, and was said to be 62-years old (if so, he was born in 1831, not 1829). He was survived by his second wife, Roderickina(n√©e McDonald), four sons, and two daughters.

It connected the Col√¥nia Agr√≠cola Benjamin Constant from 1904 to 1964 with the riverboat port of Sapucaia on the Rio Caet√© opposite Bragan√ßa in the state of Par√°.  History  The governor of the Brazilian state of Par√° decided, to build a Decauville railway between the Col√¥nia Agr√≠cola Benjamin Constant, named after the republic's founder Benjamin Constant Botelho de Magalh√£es, and the city of Bragan√ßa. He signed on 27 April 1900 a contract with the civil engineer Guilherme von Linde, who could, however, not fulfill his obligations, although the completion date was twice postponed until 27 April 1903. Therefore, his successor, Governor Augusto Montenegro, commissioned engineer Dr. Ing. Amynthas de Lemos to prepare a report on the state of work. He was able to ascertain without much difficulty that the instructions had not been followed because no plans or sections of the track, bridges, stations, culverts or the work specified in the contract could be found. Even in the section, where the rails had been laid, the execution had only a provisional character: the railway embankments were made ftom material that had been dug-out alongside the embankment ditches, so that the drainage was obstructed, which led to water accumulation and endangered the strength of the railway embankments. Only in a few cuttings the sides were beveled, but the excavated material had been piled up along the crest line. Two of the culverts, one with drywall and the other one measuring 0.6 x 0.7 x 11.15 m (2 ft √ó 2 ft 4 in √ó 36 ft 7 in), were unsafe. In the latter, iron sleepers were used for the retaining walls. The two open culverts had also a very temporary character. The rails were laid without ballast, contrary to the contract, according to which the ballast bed should have been high. The sleepers were very far apart, in some cases up to 1 m (3 ft 6 in), severely affecting the stability of the track and causing many rails to twist and twist. Despite the contracted use of hardwood sleepers, there were very few of these, and these were of the worst quality. The track had been laid without proper surveying or leveling, occasionally there were counter-curves without intermediate straight sections. The arches had very small radii and there were no even stretches between decline and incline. In addition, it would have been impossible to lay more track, even if the government had done so itself, as the barque Agnes had been stranded and abandoned with all building materials at Sapucaia, before it could be unloaded, as agreed with the insurance company. The contract was therefore terminated, and Governor Montenegro duly authorized the engineer Lemos on behalf of the colonial administration to continue the construction work. The work was completed and the track was ready for commissioning by 7 September 1904.  Location  Governor Montenegro's report to the Members of the Legislative Congress on 7th September 1904 The Decauville railway, which connected the port of Sapucaia with the Benjamin Constant Colony, began at the port of Sapucaia. It followed the right-hand bank of the Caet√© River, above Bragan√ßa. It had a gauge of and was made with steel rails, which had a weight of 9 kg/m (18 lbs/yd). They were laid on wooden sleepers that were rectangularly flattened on all four sides. The track was a total of long, of which were straight were curved. The maximum radius of the curves was and the minimum radius . There were a total of 28 arches, 7,606 m of track ran in incisions and 10,398 m on embankments. The jetty in Sapucaia was 15 √ó 4 m. There was a bridge over the Igarap√© Cujubim(sv) as well as three more bridges, an open culvert with the dimensions of 0.60 √ó 0.47 √ó 11.15 m, two wyes, two water tanks, two stations and one shed for rail vehicles and workshops. For the operation of the route a telephone line had been laid, which connected the station Benjamin Constant with that in Bragan√ßa. For the work under the direction of Dr. Aniynthas de Lemos by 31 July 1903 costs of R$ 93,177 incurred.  Rolling stock  The railway had initially 2 locomotives, 2 passenger cars, 2 baggage cars, 2 platform wagons with 10 tons each, 9 small freight cars and 2 timber wagons. The first steam locomotive was delivered in 1902. The second locomotive arrived in 1903 disassembled in individual parts and was assembled on site. The third was commissioned in 1906.  Further plans  The construction of the Benjamin Constant Railway was very important to the city of Bragan√ßa. It was planned to extend the track to Gurupy so that it would have been a total of 45 kilometers long. After completion of the meterspurigen Bragan√ßa train it should be operated as a branch line. It was planned to build a bridge over the Rio Caete to connect with the city of Bragan√ßa.  Operator change and extension The Estrada de Ferro Bragan√ßa took over in 1908 the management of the branch line to Benjamin Constant and their train drivers. The narrow gauge line was extended in 1908 to a length of .  Decommissioning  The Decauville railway and its terminus, which has been called Tijoca since the 1950s, was officially shut down on 27 May 1964 by the RFFSA.

Sosland, grandson of Jewish emigres from Czarist Russia, was a prominent Kansas City businessman who died in April 2019. Born in 1925, he began working for the Sosland Publishing Company in 1947, serving as the company's publisher and editor for several decades. A graduate of Southwestern High School, Sosland entered Harvard University in 1942. After his first year of study, however, he left school to enlist in the U.S. Army. Sosland served in WWII under General Patton during the Battle of the Bulge. He returned to Harvard University in 1946 to complete his coursework in business and economics. After marrying his childhood sweetheart, Estelle Glatt, he came back to Kansas City in 1947.  Food industry  Sosland had a long career in the grain and food publishing business. At 22, he joined the Sosland Publishing Company, a firm specializing in trade journals started by his father David and uncle Samuel. The company, founded in 1922, printed news and information about agricultural forecasts, food trends, and global consumer markets. Sosland rose through company ranks eventually creating much of the editorial content for several of the company magazines, including their very influential flagship, Milling & Baking News. By the 1970s, Sosland was an internationally known authority on food markets and global politics.  Kansas City Involvement  Morton and Estelle Sosland were extremely involved in the Kansas City community including support of several Jewish community organizations, as well as the Midwest Research Institute (now MRI Global), Menorah Medical Center, and especially, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. The 2009 gift of their personal collection of Native American art formed the foundation for the museum's native arts gallery. Most famously (and controversially), the Sosland's commissioned the Shuttlecocks, the now iconic oversized badminton birdies that grace the lawn of the Nelson-Atkins. When first unveiled, the sculptures, created by artists Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, were panned by critics. Said one local newspaper editor, the birdies are \\"so offensively silly looking that they simply have to be included in any article about Kansas Citians being played as saps.\\" Today, these sculptures are an important part of the visual landscape of the city. Of his community support, Sosland reported, \\"I was brought up to feel that we all owe something to the world around us.\\" In 1954, he started the Sosland Foundation serving as its president for many years. He also served on the boards of many local foundations including those \\"with a considerable Kansas City presence includ[ing] H&R; Block, Inc., Commerce Bancshares, Inc., ERC Corporation, Hallmark Cards, Inc., Kansas City Southern Industries, Stilwell Financial, Inc., and Trans World Airlines. He also was a member of the board of Brown Shoe Co., Inc., Ingredient Technology Corp., TW Services, Inc., and Continental Grain Co.\\" In recognition of his service, Sosland received numerous awards and recognition. In 1975, he was selected as \\"Mr. Kansas City\\" by the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce. He also received the Chancellor's Medal from the University of Missouri‚ÄîKansas City and induction into the Academy of Missouri Squires in 1987. In 2002, he received the Leader in Agriculture Award and in 2006, he was in the first class of the Baking Hall of Fame. In the UK Morton and Estelle Sosland maintained a home in Sussex for many years, and supported diverse charities including Glyndebourne , and also helped the British Museum acquire nearly 200 works Of Sosland's noted importance to his home community, one civic leader remarked that, \\"We are humbled by what he accomplished in his many decades as a civic leader and how he raised the level of what Kansas City is.\\" References Category:Harvard University alumni Category:1925 births Category:2019 deaths Category:American Jews Category:American people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:Businesspeople from Kansas City, Missouri Category:American editors Category:American philanthropists Category:Kansas City philanthropists ","title":"Morton Sosland"},{"id":"61236249","text":"Kosmiic Chat is an Indian talk show created and produced by Ekta Kapoor and Shobha Kapoor under their banner Balaji Telefilms.

The box sits beside a loom and allows one to rapidly switch between two shuttles with bobbins, usually of different colors, making it easier and quicker to weave multiple colors for figured fabrics or striped wefts without stopping to manually change shuttles. The drop box consists of a partitioned lift mechanism at one end of the loom, of which any section can be lowered to the working height of the loom so that the shuttle can be loaded. Whilst the drop box made weaving equipment significantly more complex and expensive, it made the process much faster and contributed to a greater uptake of the flying shuttle which was invented by Robert Kay's father John Kay. The drop box was never patented.

He was a senior research scientist in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), ending his career as chief of the Division of Mineral Chemistry. In 1964 he and Isabel Bear scientifically described the smell of rain, for which he coined the term \\"petrichor\\". Early life Thomas was born on 29 March 1901 in Kapunda, South Australia. He was the son of a pastoralist. As a child he became interested in minerals after exploring abandoned copper mines near his home. In later life he recalled one of his earliest experiments as placing pieces of atacamite into a fire to obtain a blue-green flame. In 1919, aged 18, Thomas participated in Herbert Basedow's medical expedition to outback South Australia and adjoining portions of Queensland. His main task was to look after the expedition's horses, while Basedow assessed the health of the local Aboriginal people. The expedition was away for four months and several horses died of thirst; Thomas later recalled \\"we were fortunate that we escaped a similar fate\\". Thomas attended the University of Adelaide where he developed a friendship with Mark Oliphant, later a prominent nuclear physicist. He graduated in 1924 with a thesis titled \\"A Remarkable Occurrence of Monazite\\", for which he was awarded the Tate Memorial Medal for \\"the best original work in Australasian geology embodied in a thesis\\". He subsequently did postgraduate work in mineralogy under Antarctic explorer Sir Douglas Mawson. Early career and animal nutrition work After leaving university, Thomas spent three years as a chemist with the Australian Radium Corporation. He devised new methods to recover uranium, radium, vanadium and scandium from the radioactive ores found at Radium Hill. In 1928, he returned to the University of Adelaide to work under Thorburn Brailsford Robertson in the biochemistry department. Robertson's department subsequently became the Division of Animal Nutrition within the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Thomas played a key role in identifying the cause of coast disease, a degenerative illness affecting sheep in coastal South Australia and Western Australia. While mapping the spread of the disease on Kangaroo Island, he realised that it was largely confined to areas with calcareous soils, lacking certain heavy metals that were known to be essential animal nutrients. By referring to earlier German experiments with rats, he correctly hypothesised that a cobalt deficiency was the primary cause of the disease, which was later confirmed experimentally by the division's head Hedley Marston. Mineral chemistry In 1939, Thomas became aware that the CSIR was planning to set up a Division of Industrial Chemistry. He subsequently wrote a 20-page letter to the new section head, Ian Wark, \\"listing a dozen or more areas where there was pressing need for investigations; some of immediate interest in connection with the war, and others of long term interest for development of Australian industry\\". Wark invited him to move to Melbourne and set up the Minerals Utilization Section within the new division. He was given the rank of senior inorganic chemist, with responsibility for non-metallic minerals and ceramics. In June 1959, the section was given divisional status as the Division of Mineral Chemistry. Thomas served as the new division's chief until his retirement in March 1961. Wark later said of him that \\"this one man's initiative has led to interesting and valuable work for two hundred people, all of whom have, of course, helped to build on the foundations of Thomas\\". One of the projects Thomas initiated was an examination of the smell of rain, which was then termed \\"argillaceous odour\\" and associated by mineralogists with argillaceous minerals. After his retirement from the CSIRO he continued to collaborate on the subject with experimental officer Isabel Bear. In March 1964 they published an article titled \\"Nature of Argillaceous Odour\\" in the journal Nature, which scientifically described the phenomenon. Thomas coined the term \\"petrichor\\" to refer to it, from the Greek \\"petra\\" (stone) and \\"ichor\\" (essence). Their experiments involved inducing the odour by steam distilling rocks that had been previously exposed to warm, dry conditions. The paper identified that the odour derived from a \\"yellowish oil\\" that was released from rocks and soils when their pores were infiltrated by moisture. Death and memorials Thomas died in 1974. His ashes were scattered over Mount Painter in the Flinders Ranges, and a memorial plaque was erected by his friend Reg Sprigg, founder of the nearby Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary. In 1975, Ian Wark formally opened the R. G. Thomas Lecture Room at the CSIRO's facilities in Melbourne.

History  The bel canto-era composer Gioachino Rossini: portrait painted circa 1815 by Vincenzo Camuccini Many tenor roles in the bel canto operas of the early 19th century have an exceptionally high tessitura with notes often well above C5 or D5. The best-known example is probably Arturo‚Äôs arioso ‚ÄúCredeasi misera‚Äùfrom Vincenzo Bellini‚Äôs I Puritani, which is composed up to F5. Normally, such high passages are beyond the vocal compass of modern tenors, raising the question of how tenors in the primo ottocento would have coped with such tessitura and extreme high notes. The concept of the voce faringea offers an answer to this question. Tenors of this musical period were trained to strengthen and modify the falsetto into a more virile and powerful vocal quality. The resulting sound was considered homogenous with that of the lower register and no longer perceived as a falsetto timbre. This register mechanism mirrors a pre-romantic vocal ideal of sound that seems clearly divergent from those prevalent today. In his 1851 work, the German singing teacher Ferdinand Sieber pointed out that tenors possessing this technique could sing with the greatest ease and practically without force up to highest tenor ranges. The quality of their high notes was so unlike a contemporary falsetto sound that it probably gave rise to the often-heard, and likely erroneous, opinion that they sang these high notes in chest voice. By balancing between vocal registers, the singer would gain a beautiful, marrow-like, mixed tone, seeming to retain the strength of chest voice and yet protect the voice as in falsetto, although without its feminine sound, as Friedrich Schmidt remarked in his 1854 vocal textbook. James Rennie wrote in 1825 that this vocal timbre was both the sweetest and the most brilliant sound the male voice could produce, possessing incomparably more pathos than any chest sound. Eighteenth and 19th century vocal pedagogical literature employed various, confusing, and even contradictory terminology for the different voice registers; however, most vocal pedagogues were in agreement regarding the particular aesthetic merits of each register‚Äîmainly, chest and falsetto. In addition to these two registers, some vocal treatises of the era make mention of a third register mechanism tenors could employ to particular artistic advantage. It was often described as an intermediate register or a special mechanism connecting the falsetto and the chest register, and was perceived as a mixture of the two, often called voix mixte (mixed voice). Vocal maestri and physiologists used different terms to denote this vocal mechanism, including head voice, falsetto or fausset/faucet, voce mezzo-falso or middle-falsetto, Schlundkopfregister, feigned voice, voix sur-laryngienne, and voix pharyngienne (pharyngeal voice or voce faringea). Gilbert Duprez The term pharyngeal voice was coined by Edgar Herbert-Caesari and was first used to describe this particular vocal mechanism in his 1950 article ‚ÄúThe Pharyngeal Voice,‚Äù in The Musical Times, and further in a chapter from his book The Voice of the Mind. Herbert-Caesari explains that the term pharyngeal voice is translated from the Italian voce faringea and was used by exponents of the ‚Äúold school‚Äù solely to describe a peculiar tonal quality produced by a distinctive mechanism. He adds that the tenors of the Rossini/Bellini/Donizetti period were taught to sing with voce faringea and furthermore, that this method enabled (particularly) tenors to sing their highest notes with ease and brilliance. In accordance with formerly prevalent vocal ideals, at least according to historical written sources, these tenori di grazia did not produce their voices with dramatic force but rather with elegance and suppleness up through their highest range. And yet the special vocal technique they employed to produce high notes considerably beyond C5 with absolute ease, security and facility gradually fell into obscurity. During the second half of the 19th century, the vocal tradition of the great bel canto tenors ultimately went out of fashion, and a new, more dramatic verismo vocal ideal took hold. Musicological scholarship attributes Gilbert Louis Duprez‚Äô interpretation of Arnold in Rossini‚Äôs Guillaume Tell, first in an 1831 performance in Luca, Italy, but more significantly in the 1837 Paris revival, as being a primary catalyst for this development. Duprez‚Äô high C5 (ut de poitrine) was not sung in the traditional bel canto falsetto dominant vocal mechanism, as the famous tenori di grazia Adolphe Nourrit, John Braham, or Giovanni Battista Rubini had sung it, but rather in modal (chest) register, similar to contemporary tenors. Duprez‚Äô ut de poitrine became the turning point after which the vocal ideal of the bel canto tenors, and subsequently the technique for developing voce faringea, were lost.  Physiology and acoustics  Vocal structures Observations made by vocal pedagogues, medical doctors and physiologists, documented in several vocal treatises as well as physiological and anatomical writings from the early 19th century, are particularly revealing with regard to training different vocal registers in the corresponding operatic tradition. Accordingly, many authors have mentioned the importance of specific muscular adjustments in both the vocal tract and the larynx for producing the ‚Äúmixed‚Äù (voce faringea) voice. Bennati, an ear, nose and throat specialist at the Paris Opera and trained singer, could study the physiological differences between vocal registers on himself and the best singers of the time. Both a contraction of the pharynx by lateral approximation of the pharyngeal walls in the area of the isthmus faucium and a narrowing of the aryepiglottic space were identified by him and other maestri and physiologists of that time as a requirement for the production of the mixed register. In addition, an increase of vocal folds mass by slightly altering the coordinative contraction of the thyroarytenoid (TA) and cricothyroid (CT) muscles and a strengthening of glottal adduction were mentioned as physiological basis for developing a falsetto tone into the mixed voice. Recent scientific investigations including the analysis of electroglottogram and flow glottogram data as well as sound spectra of a falsetto dominant mixed phonation mode, also referred to as voce faringea, have provided evidence that may help to define certain characteristics of a forgotten singing practice of the bel canto tenors in the primo ottocento. Specific physiological and acoustic peculiarities of the voce faringea and a clear distinction from the falsetto and chest registers could be documented. Assumptions that the production of voce faringea requires peculiar configuration of both the laryngeal mechanism and the vocal tract were confirmed.  Application for female and low male voices As evidenced by various historical vocal textbooks and physiological writings, the voce faringea was primarily developed and used by the tenors of the early 19th for the top notes of the opera roles of the bel canto period. However, in his book The Voice of the Mind Edgar Herbert-Caesari explained that this voice function can be trained and applied also by baritones as well as by all female voices. He describes that the sound formation of the pharyngeal voice is possible for both female and male voices in the same frequency range, between F4 and D5 (expandable down to about C4 and upwards to F5). For male voices, this voice register function can therefore be used in the high, for female voices in the medium and low ranges. For baritones and bass voices, the voce faringea can be used for creating a light, flexible and graceful tone quality in medium and high ranges. It is particularly suitable for the interpretation of intimate and lyric moments in the art song as well as in the opera and oratorio repertoire. Since in classical singing, female voices are trained to expand the head register into their low range, typically, tones down to B3 or A3 can also be produced in the light register mode. Nevertheless, many sopranos, mezzo-sopranos and altos feel that their voices are losing strength when singing low notes in head voice and that the phonation is in general becoming breathier and increasingly unstable below about E4 down. Here, the voce faringea concept offers female singers an effective vocal tool to concentrate and strengthen the sound of the head voice in the low range and to accomplish a soft and continuous transition into the chest register.  Application in contemporary popular singing styles Chaka Khan In recent years, the pharyngeal voice has been rediscovered also by representatives of the CCM (Contemporary Commercial Music) genres like Aretha Franklin, Natalie Cole, Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Freddy Mercury, Axl Rose, Brian Johnson or Jon Bon Jovi as well as by well-known stars of the Broadway musical. In contemporary popular music singing styles the pharyngeal voice is typically seen as an effective coupling mechanism between the modal and falsetto registers and primarily used in semi-metallic and metallic phonation modes‚Äîfor example by male rock and hard rock artists singing in exceptionally high vocal ranges similar to those of the high bel canto tenor repertoire of the early nineteenth century. In addition, the pharyngeal voice can also be trained and used in a particularly effectively way by female CCM vocalists as an extension or partly replacement of the traditional belting technique, which is typically based on the laryngeal modal or chest register. Regarding the resonance strategy for both vocal mechanisms, which is in particular the aim to amplify metallic sound components, there can be found wide similarities for belting and the pharyngeal voice, why the latter is also known as Faux Belt or Fake Belt. However, by applying a comparably reduced vocal fold mass in falsetto mechanism and lower subglottic air pressure ratios, the pharyngeal voice can be used more flexible and economical in the high belting ranges with comparable sound intensity and voice power.
