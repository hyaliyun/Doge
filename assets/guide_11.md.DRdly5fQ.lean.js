Koh-i-Chiltan is the summit of a steep, rocky mountain called Chiltan or Chehel-Tan (Persian/Balochi: 'Forty Bodies'). 'Lwarrh Saar' is the highest peak of Chiltan mountains range at , it is the third-highest peak of Quetta after Zarghoon Ghar and Koh-i-Takatu, and fifth- highest peak of Balochistan. There are many juniper trees found in high ranges. Koh-i-Chiltan legends Koh-i-Chiltan is said to be haunted. A local story about the mountain tells the tale:\\"Haunted\\" source: A Ride to India Across Persia and Balochistan by Harry de Windt (1856-1933). ::A frugal couple, married for many years, were unblessed with offspring. They therefore sought the advice of a holy man, who rebuked the wife, saying that he had not the power to grant her what Heaven had denied. The priest's son, however (also a mullah), felt convinced he could satisfy her wishes, and cast forty pebbles into her lap, at the same time praying that she might bear children. In process of time she was delivered of forty babies rather more than she wished or knew how to provide for. The poor husband at his wits' end ascended to the summit of Chehel-Tan with thirty-nine and left them there trusting to the mercy of the Deity to provide for them while the fortieth baby was brought up under the paternal roof. ::One day, however, touched by remorse the wife unknown to her husband explored the mountain with the object of collecting the bones of her children and burying them. To her surprise, they were all living and gambolling among the trees and rocks. Wild with joy she ran back to her dwelling brought out the fortieth babe and placing it on the summit of the mountain left it there for a night to allure back its brothers but on returning in the morning she found that the latter had carried it off and it was never seen again. It is by the spirits of these forty babies that Chehel- Tan is said to be haunted.  Wildlife  Chiltan mountain has various animals and different kind of birds seem to be living freely throughout the mountain chiltan, more than thousand markhors have been reported.

An intentional community with Quaker origins has been located at Stapleton, near Pontefract, Yorkshire, since 1921. History Brotherhood Church, Southgate Road, London. The church can be traced back to 1887 when a Congregationalist minister called John Bruce Wallace started a magazine called \\"The Brotherhood\\" in Limavady, Northern Ireland. Wallace was influenced by the views of Henry George and Edward Bellamy. In 1891 Wallace moved to London and took over a derelict church in Southgate Road, Hackney, naming it \\"The Brotherhood Church.\\" The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party used the building in 1907 for their 5th Congress. Subsequent communities were established by a Tolstoyan named John Coleman Kenworthy in Croydon, Surrey, in 1894 and Purleigh, Essex, in 1896. Residents at Croydon and Purleigh included Aylmer and Louise Maude and Vladimir Chertkov. However, both these communities ceased shortly after they were established, as Kenworthy fell out with Chertkov and argued with Aylmer Maude over the English translation of Tolstoy's works. Based on a letter from Tolstoy, Kenworthy was under the impression that he had exclusive rights over some of Tolstoy's texts. Aylmer Maude, on the other hand, believed the reason for the failure of the colony was due to Kenworthy's autocratic and irresponsible behaviour. In 1897 several members, some from a Quaker background, moved to Leeds. The receipt of a legacy enabled the group to relocate to a seven and a half acre smallholding at Stapleton in 1921. Another Purleigh splinter group established the Whiteway Colony in 1898, funded by a Quaker journalist. John Bruce Wallace went on to become an early resident at Letchworth in Hertfordshire where he held religious gatherings each Sunday in the Howard Hall. After the establishment of the Brotherhood Church Wallace founded the Alpha Union Society which held many of its meetings at the recently built The Cloisters in Letchworth.Spirituality and Belief in Letchworth Garden City - Letchworth Garden City Collection Stapleton Colony The Stapleton Colony are vegetarian, grow much of their own organic food and attempt to live independently from the government .

Babcock, N.G. Adams 2001 In chemistry, the dissociation of a molecule into two or more fragments can take place in the gas phase, provided there is sufficient internal energy for the requisite barriers to be overcome. For many years, it was assumed that the fragments of a gas phase dissociation simply fly apart. In 1958, Allan Maccoll suggested that the decomposition of alkyl halides (RX) might take place via the intermediacy of ion pairs, [R+ X−], in which the charged fragments were no longer covalently bonded but were held together by electrostatic attraction. Maccoll, A., Heterolysis and the Pyrolysis of Alkyl Halides in the Gas Phase Chemical Reviews 1969, 69, 33–60 Maccoll and coworkers subsequently examined chlorine isotope effects in the thermal decomposition of chloroethane and concluded that the data did not support that interpretation;Christie, J.R.; Johnson, W.D.; Loudon, A.G.; Maccoll, A.; Mruzek, M.N.

Part 3.—The Chlorine Kinetic Isotope Effect in the Gas-Phase Unimolecular Decomposition of Ethyl Chloride Journal of the Chemical Society, Faraday Transactions 1 1975, 71, 1937–1941 however, he had provided the germ of an idea that came to fruition two decades later in the study of decompositions of electrically charged molecules. In the late 1970s three research groups—in England,Bowen, R.D., Ion-Neutral Complexes Accounts of Chemical Research 1991, 24, 364–371 the United States,McAdoo, D.J.; Morton, T.H., Gas Phase Analogues of Cage Effects Accounts of Chemical Research 1993, 26, 295–302 and FranceLongevialle, P., Ion–Neutral Complexes in the Unimolecular Reactivity of Organic Cations in the Gas Phase Mass Spectrometry Reviews 1992, 11, 157–192 —independently provided evidence for the occurrence of ion-neutral complexes (sometimes called ion-dipole complexes or ion-molecule complexes) in the unimolecular dissociations of positive ions under the conditions associated with mass spectrometry (i.e. as isolated species in a vacuum). The general idea is that a charged species, RY+, can give rise to dissociation fragments via a transient complex, [R+ Y], in which the electrically charged partner, R+, can undergo molecular rearrangements at the same time as it rotates relative to the neutral partner, Y. Similarly, the neutral partner, Y, can also rotate relative to the charged partner, as well as having the ability to exchange Hydrogens and internal energy with it. More recently several research groups have provided evidence that revives Maccoll's original hypothesis, but with the variation that the fragments that sojourn in the presence of one another are both electrically uncharged.Suits, A.G., Roaming Atoms and Radicals: A New Mechanism in Molecular Dissociation Accounts of Chemical Research 2008, 41, 873–881 In other words, dissociations of a neutral molecule RX can take place in the gas phase via the intermediacy of radical pairs [R· X·], where X· can be as small as a hydrogen atom. In the gas phase such intermediates are often called roaming radicals. Bowman, J.M.; Shepler, B.C.

Gao Changgong was the grandson of Gao Huan and the fourth son of Gao Cheng. According to the Book of Northern Qi and the Record of the Court Entertainment Bureau, Gao Changgong had a beautiful face and feminine physical appearance thus he always wore a terrible mask when he fought in battles.  Biography  Gao Changgong was born the fourth son of Gao Cheng, elder brother of the first emperor of Northern Qi and therefore a prince of Northern Qi, he was given the title of Prince of Lanling. Gao Changgong was also made a general by Emperor Wucheng of Northern Qi (Gao Zhan), his uncle, and his distinction in battles as well as personal kindness and bravery led him becoming widely loved and admired. Legend has it that he looked beautiful like a woman so he wore a mask in battles to appear more fearsome to the enemy. Gao Changgong repelled the First Turkic Khaganate when they attacked Jinyang (晋阳, now the city of Taiyuan). His most famous battle however was the rescue of the siege of Jinyong (金墉, near modern Luoyang) in 564 A.D. Gao Changgong led only 500 cavalrymen and fought through an army of Northern Zhou, which was attacking the city with 100,000 soldiers. He fought his way to the gates the city, surprising the defenders. The soldiers of Jinyong didn't recognize him, so he took off his helmet and mask. The soldiers in the city rejoiced at his arrival and were refilled with courage. They opened the gates and joined the battle outside the city. Soon the army of Northern Zhou was defeated. The performance of the masked dance The Prince of Lanling (蘭陵王) in Japan. In order to celebrate the victory, the soldiers composed the famous song and dance \\"Prince Lanling in Battle” (蘭陵王入陣曲, also known as 大面, \\"The great mask\\"). According to the Record of the Court Entertainment Bureau (教坊記) of Tang dynasty, the dance \\"Great mask\\" was one of the court musics to be performed with the emperor's audience. The song and the dance are long lost in China, however, it was introduced into Japan during the Tang Dynasty and is still being performed in some ceremonies today. After the death of Gao Zhan, Gao Changgong's cousin Gao Wei ascended the throne. Gao Changong's reputation, competence and influence over the army upset the young emperor. Gao Wei asked Gao Changgong about the battle at Jinyong: \\"You penetrated too deeply into the formation; if you had suffered a military reverse, it would be too late to regret such an action.\\" Gao Changgong replied: \\"I am responsible for our family affairs, I did it without considering the consequences.\\" The emperor, hearing the reference to \\"family affairs\\" became suspicious. He was afraid that Gao Changgong might overthrow him. Many members of the Gao family had met their ends at the hands of brothers and cousins, and he became paranoid that he would have the same fate. To avoid the emperor's suspicion and jealousy, Gao Changgong often pretended to be sick, staying away from wars and politics. No matter how low a profile he kept, the emperor still sent him a cup of poisonous wine one day in 573 A.D. Gao Changgong drank the wine and ended his life, probably in his early 30s. Four years after Gao Changgong's death, having lost one of its greatest generals, Northern Qi was destroyed by Northern Zhou. All the members of the Gao royal family were slaughtered. In 1999, within the cave of Longmen, a message was found carved into a statue, indicates that the Prince of Lan Ling had living descendants. Popular culture Gao Changgong is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI by Koei.

Washington Convention Center usually in late January. It is among the largest auto shows in North America, trailing only the North American International Auto Show in Detroit (NAIAS), the LA Auto Show, the New York International Auto Show (NYIAS) and the Chicago Auto Show in size. It is sometimes also referred to as the D.C. Auto Show. The event has evolved to emphasize and showcase the latest innovations in sustainable automotive technologies. Since 2008 the winners of the Green Car Vision Award are announced during the show.  Overview  Designated one of the nation’s top five auto shows by the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, The Washington Auto Show includes cutting-edge exhibits, latest model cars and displays of historic vehicles. Often referred to as the “Public Policy Show” on the auto show circuit, the 10-day public show is preceded by two Public Policy Preview Days of special events and announcements for officials in government, industry and the media. The Washington Auto Show is also the largest public show in Washington, D.C. Over the course of its many years this beloved and historic D.C. tradition has attracted Washingtonians of all stripes – and political affiliations. On display are more than 700 new models from over 42 manufacturers. Advanced Technology Super Highway exhibition floor at the 2010 show  MobilityTalks International®  MobilityTalks International® is a forum designed for governments from around the world to exchange ideas on best practices related to the emerging trends in transportation surrounding connected and autonomous vehicles. The changing landscape of transportation presents lawmakers and regulators with unique challenges and opportunities that can be more effectively addressed through partnership and collaboration. History Toyota NS4 plug-in hybrid concept at the 2012 show.In 1921, a group of 20 Washington-area car dealers and distributors planned the first show to sell the public on the virtue of the horseless carriage. From that humble beginning, The Washington Auto Show has been on the fast track for growth and popularity. Housed in a variety of area venues, the show was staged for 18 years in the National Guard D.C. Armory. The show has gone on hiatus twice – once for war and once due to poor economic conditions. After a break in the 1970s, the Washington Convention Center and The Washington Auto Show opened together in early 1983. By this date, the auto show had grown to require every available foot of display space, covering nearly eight acres – almost four times the physical size of the Armory shows, with three times as many models. In 1988, The Washington Auto Show began using the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day as its annual time frame, garnering a tremendous base of loyal fans and establishing its reputation as a family destination. The event was later moved to late January to coincide with Congress’ return from recess, enabling the show to capitalize on the business of Washington. The show’s early planners, who sought every imaginative twist to draw attention to that newfangled mode of transportation, would be amazed to witness today’s incarnation. The show features a full slate of entertainment, contests, interactive displays, exhibits on futuristic technology and family activities that can actually offer visitors a break from all those cars! And at the same time, The Washington Auto Show has firmly earned its title as one of the industry’s most prominent and pivotal events. 2008 The 2008 show ran from January 23 through January 27, 2008. 2009 The 2009 show ran from February 4 through February 8, 2009. 2010 The 2010 show ran from January 25 through January 31, 2010.

Early life, education and personal life Elechi was born in Ezza Ofu Village in Ezza Inyimagu Izzi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State in 1948 to a family of . Elechi attended Covenant Primary School in Afikpo from 1954–1961. She then moved to Holy Child Secondary School in Sharon from 1962–1966. Elechi took a break from school to work at Nigeria Construction and Furniture Company from 1973–1975. Finally, she attended Enugu State University of Technology (ESUT) from 1993-2000 earning a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree. After obtaining her degree, she continued to work until her marriage. Elechi is married to Chief Martin Elechi and has four children, three boys and one girl. Elechi is a member of the Izzi ethnic group. Political career Since 2004, she has served on the Ebonyi State Committee on Tsunami Disaster. When her husband, Martin Elechi became governor on May 29, 2007 she became more involved in political life, becoming the Chair of the Ebonyi State Women Development Commission (WDC) in 2007, and Chair of the Mother and Child Care Initiative (MCCI), also in 2007. The Mother and Child Care Initiative (MCCI) used public and private partner sponsorship to address issues for the benefit of Ebonyi women and children. Mother and Child Care Initiative The thematic areas of the MCCI Program include: *Reduction of the unacceptably high maternal/neonatal mortality *Reduction of maternal morbidities like obstetric fistula *Early detection of breast and cervical cancer *Girl-child education *Youth/Women empowerment *HIV/AIDS *Orphan and vulnerable children (OVCs) The overall goal is to promote the survival of Ebonyi women and children. Action commenced in August 2007 with the drafting of a \\"road map\\". The work plan for 2008-2009 was synthesized out of this document. Many activities have been carried out since 2008 in the areas of promotion of maternal mortality, cancer and gender-based violence including: *Advocacy visits, interactive forums and meetings to create awareness about MCCI and its projects, and obtain support. The target audience included: **The Federal Ministry of Health **UNFPA **UNICEF **USAID **Ebonyi State Executive Council Members **Ebonyi State Legislators **Chairmen of LGAs and Coordinators of Development Centers **Corporate Organizations **Financial Institutions **The Media **Various Ministries in the State **The State Planning Commission *A technical committee of three (3) persons from the ministries of Health, Education, Agriculture, Youth and Sports, Women Affairs and Social Development was inaugurated to collaborate between MCCI and their ministries so as to strengthen and increase inter-sectoral collaboration and partnership. *To aid effective evaluation of the MCCI Program, a baseline survey was conducted to obtain data for subsequent evaluation of the Program. To ensure accuracy of data collected, a 2-day baseline survey workshop to train field workers was organized for staff of the health and education departments in the 13 LGAs and for staff of the line ministries. The MCCI monitoring team supervised and monitored the data collection. The data was processed, analyzed and sent to the line ministries to assist in their policy formulation. *A 3-day Safe Motherhood Workshop was organized for all stakeholders including EXCO members, Legislators; the Judiciary, Local Government Chairmen, Development Center Coordinators and their spouses, traditional rulers, the clergy, traditional birth attendants (TBAs) and other care givers to create awareness and sensitize the public about the unacceptable maternal mortality and morbidities in the State, as well as proffer ways of reducing the scourge. *The workshop which kick-started with a Safe Motherhood Walk at the State capital led by Elechi, accompanied by the Deputy Governor and his wife and other Ebonyi men and women, ran simultaneously in the State Capital and 13 LGAs of the State. There was also a pre-workshop symposium organized by MCCI with expert representatives from the Federal Ministries of Health and Education as well as UNICEF. Other key stakeholders in the State Ministries of Education and Health also participated. There were three interactive sessions after the workshop and the third session had the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Health in attendance. The conceptual document of MCCI was further ventilated during the sessions as well as ways of strengthening the relevant ministries of Health and Education. *To effectively facilitate the reduction of maternal mortality in the State, a Bill on Mother and Child Initiative and Related Matters capturing maternal mortality monitoring, was sponsored to the State House of Assembly by Elechi. The aim is to, among others, have a law in the State that will make maternal death reportable and stipulates 10 hours duration for referral of pregnant women laboring in peripheral center. The Bill was eventually passed into Law on May 21, 2008 and assented to by the Governor on June 5, 2008. Full implementation of the Law was stepped down to 2009 after adequate sensitization, awareness creation and inauguration of the maternal mortality monitoring committees at the State, LGA and Ward levels, as well as the implementation of the Free Maternal Healthcare Program of the State Government. *A technical committee of the State Ministry of Health and MCCI undertook an evaluation of the state of healthcare facilities in the State to facilitate improvement in the delivery of healthcare services in the State. *MCCI undertook advocacy visits to the 13 LGAs to sensitize and mobilize the public so as to enhance community participation in MCCI thematic areas. *Having garnered the necessary support, the MCCI team set out to construct and equip a Vesico-Vaginal Fistula Center for the South-East zone to make Ebonyi a center of excellence in VVF management. This was done in collaboration with UNFPA. *With the Center being put in place, the team set out to identify and prepare VVF patients for the first ever VVF mass repair campaign in Southern Nigeria. The campaign took off on November 17, 2008 in collaboration with UNFPA, followed by the official commissioning of the center by the wife of the President and First Lady of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Hajiya (Dr.) Turai Yar’Adua on December 5, 2008. *In collaboration with Acquire Project Fistula Care, a training on infection prevention and control was organized for the staff of the Fistula Center to equip them with modern concepts of infection prevention and hospital waste management, as well as universal safety precautions that would protect the provider and clients from acquiring hospital infections. *The 2009 program commenced with sensitization campaigns and awareness creation at the LGAs on the dangers of female genital cutting, teenage pregnancy, need for pregnant women to attend antenatal clinics and deliver in the hospital; girl-child education, constant self-examination for early detection of breast cancer, and need for annual screening for premalignant lesions of the cervix. Also, a lot of sensitization is ongoing on the maternal mortality law. The sensitization and awareness creation is through MCCI jingles with electronic media and also by the MCCE team led by Elechi that has been visiting the various communities and LGAs. This sensitization has become necessary because of the effects of these issues on maternal health. *A 2-day stakeholders forum was organized and attended by MCCI, the Federal Ministry of Health, USAID/Acquire Fistula Project and UNFPA. The forum was organized to explore areas of assistance by the Federal Ministry of Health and linkages by the South-East Regional VVF Center with other partners to ensure the Program's sustainability in terms of provision of free treatment for patients within the region and to ensure that the center receives annual financial assistance. *Elechi hosted a one-day Inaugural Forum of Wives of Governors of South-East and Benue States in collaboration with UNICEF to form an alliance for a shared vision on issues of women and children in the focal areas. *Radio and TV jingles have been produced in English and local languages to enhance publicity on the issues. *Other areas of concern and interest captured by MCCI include the Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVCs) comprising orphans, street children, hawkers, those working at the quarry sites and rice mill. The initiative includes identification of all OVCs in the State and the development of an instrument for conducting a needs assessment after the identification exercise. *The Office of the Wife of the Governor, through the Free Mobile Clinic program is currently engaged in a Statewide free mobile health care exercise, where health care delivery is carried down to the communities in the various LGAs and Development Centers. *During such exercises, deworming exercises are performed on school children to enhance their intelligence status. Elechi recently gave a presentation at the international Women Deliver conference in Washington DC on June 7–9, 2010. The theme of the conference was Delivering Solutions for Girls and Women. The conference was organized by Women Deliver, a global advocacy organization bringing together voices from around the world to call for action against maternal death. Sponsorship and support for the conference was provided by a host of governmental and non-governmental organizations, including The World Bank, WHO, UNICEF, USAID, UNFPA, UNAIDS, The European Union, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and many others. Conference attendees included First Ladies from various countries, representatives of various countries and NGOs, and medical experts in the field of obstetric and fistula care. Mrs. Elechi was the lead speaker in a conference session on June 9, 2010 titled, \\"Innovations in Fistula Prevention, Treatment, and Reintegration.\\" In her presentation, she described efforts to combat vesico-vaginal fistula (VVF) in Ebonyi State through a combination of legislation, enlightenment, prevention and treatment. ...

Offering a natural fortification, its rocky cliffs tower above the River Alzette which surrounds it on three sides. It was here that Count Siegfried built his Castle of Lucilinburhuc in 963, providing a basis for the development of the town which became Luxembourg. Over the centuries, the Bock and the surrounding defences were reinforced, attacked and rebuilt time and time again as the armies of the Burgundians, Habsburgs, Spaniards, Prussians and French vied for victory over one of Europe's most strategic strongholds, the Fortress of Luxembourg. Warring did not stop until the Treaty of London was signed in 1867, calling for the demolition of the fortifications. Ruins of the old castle and the vast underground system of passages and galleries known as the casemates continue to be a major tourist attraction. History Count Siegfried of Luxembourg The Bock cliff with loop-holes for the cannons It was in 963 that Count Siegfried, in search of a site from which he could defend his properties, obtained the Bock and its surroundings from St Maximin's Abbey in Trier in exchange for the land he owned at Feulen in the Ardennes to the north. The Romans, then the Franks, had probably already inhabited the Bock although there is only scant archeological evidence of their presence.Jean-Marie Kreins, \\"Histoire du Luxembourg\\", Presses universitaires de France, 1996.Isabelle Yegles-Becker, \\"La naissance d'une ville\\", Onsstad.lu Retrieved 25 September 2010. There are however traces of a 4th-century Roman watchtower close to the point in the Fish Market where two major Roman roads used to cross, one from Reims to Trier and the other from Metz to Liège.Josiane Kartheiser, \\"Luxembourg: Die Stadt - La Ville - The City\\", Editions Guy Binsfeld. . Photograph of the four Bock gates (c. 1867) The first historical mention of the Bock is indeed in connection with a watchtower or fortification on the Roman road from Reims to Trier which, in 723, was ceded by Charles Martel, Duke of the Franks, to the Abbey of St Maximin in Trier. Two centuries later, Count Siegfried, who had properties \\"in Feulen, Hosingen and Monnerich in the Pagus Wabrensis, in Sarreburg, Berncastel and Roussy in the Pagus Mosellanus\\", was looking for a location for a castle able to withstand any onslaught which would serve as a central point for his holdings. After failing to obtain a site near the Abbey of Stavelot, now in the Belgian province of Liège, he approached the Abbot of St Maximin's for the purchase of the property high up on the Bock cliff above the Alzette River, described as a \\"castle by name Lucilinburhuc\\" (castellum quod dicitur Lucilinburhuc). It therefore seems as if there was already a castle on the site before Siegfried became interested in it and that it was not Siegfried who called it Lucilinburhuc. After the consent of Emperor Otto I had been obtained, the deed was signed by Viker, Abbot of St Maximin's, on 7 April 963. Siegfried acquired the site in exchange for some of his properties at Feulen.John Allyne Gade, \\"Luxembourg in the Middle Ages\\", Luxembourg: E. J. Brill, 1951, 251 pp. Online access here Map of Luxembourg by Matteus Seuter (c. 1730) Over the centuries, Siegfried's fortified castle on the Bock was considerably enlarged and protected with additional walls and defences. In 987, the castle chapel was built at the nearby Fish Market. Today's St Michael's Church stands on the same site.\\"Patrimoine religieux\\", ONT Luxembourg. . Retrieved 27 September 2010. Under Conrad I, the castle became the residence of the Counts of Luxembourg. It was damaged, destroyed, captured and rebuilt on several occasions as the Burgundians (1473), the Habsburgs (1477), and the Spaniards (1555) attacked and took the fortress. As time passed, the fortifications needed to be adapted to new methods of war based on increasingly strong firepower. During the 1640s under the Spaniards, the Swiss engineer Isaac von Treybach significantly reworked the defences. The Bock was also strengthened with three forts, the Large Bock, Middle Bock and Small Bock (from west to east), separated from each other by cuts in the rock and linked by bridges. As a result, little remained of the medieval castle.\\"Luxembourg\\" , Fortified Places. Retrieved 28 September 2010. A little later in 1684, on behalf of Louis XIV, Vauban succeeded in capturing the city of Luxembourg during a month-long siege under which the Bock fortifications were completely flattened. Thereafter Vauban, perhaps the most competent fortification engineer of his day, undertook major additions to the defences, realizing that underground passages and chambers were just as important as the surface installations. The Large Bock, connected to the old town by the Pont du Château, was further reinforced. Enclosed by a wall 12 m (39 ft) high, it was the major component of the new fortress.\\"Le Bock\\", Service des sites et monuments nationaux. Retrieved 25 September 2010. The \\"Hollow Tooth\\" ruin In addition to these structures, the Bock also included a system of casemates which originated in the cellars of the medieval castle. In 1744, during the Austrian period, these underground passages were considerably enlarged by General Neipperg. The main passage. which still remains, is 110 m long and up to 7 m wide. Branches leading off on either side were equipped with no less than 25 cannon slots, 12 to the north and 13 to the south, offering considerable firepower. In the event of war, the Bock casemates, covering an area of 1,100 m2, could be used as barracks for several hundred soldiers. Water was supplied from a well 47 m deep. Thanks to its defences, in 1794 during the French Revolutionary Wars, the city held out against a French siege for seven months. When the garrison finally surrendered, the walls were still unbreached. This led the French politician and engineer Lazare Carnot to call the Luxembourg fortress \\"the best in the world, apart from Gibraltar\\". As a result, it has often been called the Gibraltar of the North. The fortifications were finally demolished under the terms of the Treaty of London in 1867. The demolition took 16 years and cost the enormous sum of 1.5 million gold francs. Pont du château The Pont du château The two-storey bridge connecting the Bock to the old town was an important component of the fortifications. Technically, it is a rather curious structure. Built in 1735 by the Austrians, it provides no less than four ways of crossing between the cliffs: the road over the top, a passage by way of the four upper arches, a spiral staircase up through the main arch and a tunnel under the road at the bottom. Famous visitors Over the years, the Bock casemates have received several famous visitors.\\"The casemates UNESCO world heritage\\", Luxembourg: the city. Retrieved 27 September 2010.

Wagner Field, (Formerly: Eglin Air Force Auxiliary Field #1), is a component of Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. It is located northeast of the main base, 13.9 miles northeast of Valparaiso, Florida. The site is notable as the training location for the Doolittle Raiders in early 1942, and the test location for the Credible Sport YMC-130H STOL 1980 Iranian Hostage rescue attempt aircraft. History With the onset of World War II, the Eglin Field military reservation was greatly expanded when the Choctawhatchee National Forest was turned over to the War Department by the U.S. Forestry Service on 18 October 1940, and a series of auxiliary airfields were constructed from January 1941. Work on Auxiliary Field 1, consisting of a triangular set of runways, began 27 November 1940. $800,000 was allocated for the grading and paving of fields 1, 3, 5, and 6 on 24 April 1941.Angell, Joseph W., \\"History of the Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command – Part One – Historical Outline 1933–1944\\", The Historical Branch, Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command, Eglin Field, Florida, 1944, reprint by Office of History, Munitions Systems Division, Eglin AFB, Florida, 1989, page 33. Auxiliary Field 1 was subsequently named Wagner Field for Major Walter J. Wagner, USAAF, former commanding officer for the 1st Proving Ground, Eglin Field, who was killed 10 October 1943 in the crash of AT-6C-NT Texan, AAF Ser. No. 41-32187,http://www.accident-report.com/world/namerica/US/FL2.html c/n 88-9677,http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_serials/1941_5.html at Eglin Auxiliary Field 2. =World War II= In March 1942, Field 1 was utilized for training by the Doolittle Raiders in preparation for their raid on Japan. A close examination of imagery of the runways still showing markings from 1942 on the surface laid down by United States Navy personnel in early 1942 delineating distances used for simulating a World War II aircraft carrier flight deck. This provided the B-25 Mitchell pilots training in short-distance takeoffs which was needed in order to conduct the raid on Japan. North of the airfield several wooden buildings were constructed as barracks and administrative offices. These were used by the Doolittle personnel during their training. Afterwards, the buildings were closed and sealed. About 1955, the buildings were cleaned out and presumably torn down due to their deteriorated state. It was recorded that inside the buildings remained an orderly room that contained numerous orders, records and notes, some signed by Doolittle. Unfortunately these records were not preserved. A metal launching rail for the Republic-Ford JB-2, a United States copy of the German V-1 flying bomb, was erected on the southeast side of the airfield () approximately 1944. After the war, it was likely used by the 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group for testing the weapon until 1949 when it was abandoned. It remains intact and visible today in aerial imagery. =Cold War= With the construction of the Eglin Air Force Base Railroad in 1951 from a connection with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad at Mossy Head, N of Wagner Field, to the Main Base, a spur line was built serving Auxiliary Field 1. The line, which ceased operation in the late 1970s, had already lifted the track to Wagner before this military rail connection was abandoned. =Credible Sport= In 1980, flight testing of modified YMC-130 Hercules transports for Operation Credible Sport took place at Wagner Field. The test bed aircraft, 74-2065, was ready for its first test flight on 18 September 1980, just three weeks after the project was initiated. The first fully modified aircraft, 74-1683, was delivered on 17 October to TAB 1, as the disused Wagner Field was designated. Between 19 October and 28 October, numerous flights were made testing various aspects, including the double-slotted flaps system, which enabled the C-130 to fly at 85 knots on final approach at a very steep eight-degree glide slope. All aspects worked flawlessly, and a full profile test was scheduled for 29 October. During the test, the Lockheed crew determined that the computer used to command the firing of the rockets during the landing sequence needed further calibration to perform the crucial firing sequence during landing, and elected to manually input commands. The reverse-mounted (forward-facing) eight ASROC rockets were situated in pairs on the upper curvature of the fuselage behind the cockpit, and at the midpoint of each side of the fuselage beneath the uppers. Testing had determined that the upper pairs, fired sequentially, could be ignited while still airborne (specifically, at 20 feet), the lower pairs could only be fired after the aircraft was on the ground. The flight engineer, blinded by the firing of the upper deceleration rockets, thought the aircraft was on the runway and fired the lower set early, while the descent-braking rockets did not fire at all. Later unofficial disclaimers alleged to have been made by some members of the Lockheed test crew asserted that the lower rockets fired themselves through an undetermined computer or electrical malfunction, which at the same time failed to fire the descent-braking rockets. As a result, the aircraft's forward flight vector was reduced to near zero, dropping it to the north-south runway and tearing off the starboard wing between the third and fourth engines. During rollout the trailing wing ignited a fire, but crash response teams extinguished the fire within eight seconds of the aircraft stopping, enabling the crew to exit the aircraft without injury. 74-1683 was destroyed but most of its unique systems were salvaged. The wrecked hull was buried at Wagner. With the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency in November 1980, the rescue mission plan was dropped. =Current status= The airfield was incorporated into Eglin AFB on 1 June 1971 and was inactivated. However, the airfield remains under the jurisdiction of the 96th Air Base Wing (96 ABW) as part of the active Eglin base and is not accessible to the public. That being said, a 2012 inspection of the north-south runway revealed recent touch-down and turn-around tread marks on the south end of the same runway upon which the Credible Sport tests took place, with a landing gear track that suggests that 1st SOW special operations C-130 Hercules variants (MC-130, etc.) may still be utilizing the historic field. Doolittle Raider reunion For the 2008 gathering of Doolittle mission survivors, six crew were present for recognition in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, culminating in a reenactment of the training sessions by three civilian-owned B-25 Mitchells at Duke Field, Auxiliary Field 3, on 31 May, which had also hosted mission training. Navy personnel from NAS Pensacola, as flight deck \\"shirt\\" crew, represented that service's contribution to the Tokyo mission. Thought had been given to using Wagner Field for the ceremonies, but investigation showed the taxiways at the disused field were in better shape than the runway.

It was issued 12 September 1897 in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome.Matthew Bunson, 2008, The Catholic Almanac, page 249 This is an encyclical on the Confraternity of the Holy Rosary. Benefit of pious associations While recognizing the natural tendency of people to associate in groups of like- minded interests, he notes the beneficial usefulness of various Catholic associations. Among these, however, he gives prominence to the Rosary Sodality. \\"Everyone knows how necessary prayer is for all men; not that God's decrees can be changed, but, as St. Gregory says, \\"that men by asking may merit to receive what Almighty God hath decreed from eternity to grant them\\"Pope Leo XIII. Augustissimae Virginis Mariae, 12 September 1897, §7, Libreria Editrice Vaticana \\"We are taught by the Catholic faith that we may pray not only to God himself, but also to the Blessed in heaven (Conc. Trid. Sess. xxv.), though in different manner; because we ask from God as from the Source of all good, but from the Saints as from intercessors. [...] Wherefore, it is said in the Apocalypse (viii., 4): 'The smoke of the incense of the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God from the hand of the angel' (Summa Theol. 2a tae, q. lxxxiii. a. iv.). [...] Now, of all the blessed in heaven, who can compare with the august Mother of God in obtaining grace? ...For, so great is her dignity, so great her favour before God, that whosoever in his need will not have recourse to her is trying to fly without wings. Leo also likens concerted communal prayer to the office of the angels. \\"With what confidence may we not hope that those who on earth have united with the Angels in this ministry will one day enjoy their blessed company in Heaven?\\" In Augustissimae Virginis, Leo contrasted the growth of the society devoted to the Rosary, the Confraternity of the Holy Rosary, versus the evil societies of his time, the Socialists and Freemasons: \\"The natural tendency of man to association has never been stronger, or more earnestly and generally followed, than in our own age. This is not at all to be reprehended, unless when so excellent a natural tendency is perverted to evil purposes, and wicked men, banding together in various forms of societies, conspire 'against the Lord and against His Christ' (Ps ii., 2). It is, however, most gratifying to observe that pious associations are becoming more and more popular among Catholics also [...]. We do not hesitate to assign a pre-eminent place among these societies to that known as the Society of the Holy Rosary. If we regard its origin, we find it distinguished by its antiquity, for St. Dominic himself is said to have been its founder.\\" See also * List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII * Mariology of Pope Leo XIII * List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII on the Rosary Notes External links * Augustissimae Virginis Mariae at the Vatican website Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII 1897 in Christianity 1897 documents September 1897 events Rosary ","title":"Augustissimae Virginis Mariae"},{"id":"28948360","text":"Geometry Expert (GEX) is a Chinese software for dynamic diagram drawing and automated geometry theorem proving and discovering.

Facts The applicants are a same-sex couple living in Vienna, Austria. On 10 September 2002 they requested the Office for matters of Personal Status (Standesamt) to proceed with the formalities to enable them to contract marriage. By decision of 20 December 2002 the Vienna Municipal Office (Magistrat) refused the applicants’ request. Referring to Article 44 of the Civil Code (Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch), it held that marriage could only be contracted between two persons of opposite sex. According to constant case-law, a marriage concluded by two persons of the same sex was null and void. Since the applicants were two men, they lacked the capacity for contracting marriage. The applicants then lodged an appeal with the Vienna Regional Governor (Landeshauptmann), which was also dismissed. In his decision of 11 April 2003, the Governor confirmed the Municipal Office’s legal view. In addition he referred to the Administrative Court’s (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) case-law according to which it constituted an impediment to marriage if the two persons concerned were of the same sex.para. 7-10 of the ECtHR judgment The ultimate and final remedy for the applicants was a complaint to the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof). In this complaint the applicants alleged that the legal impossibility for them to get married constituted a violation of their constitutional right to respect for private and family life and of the principle of non-discrimination. (Austria treats the ECHR as part of its own constitutional law. The legal provisions referred to by the applicants were thus those set out in Articles 12, 8 and 14 of the Convention). They argued that the notion of marriage had evolved since the entry into force of the Civil Code in 1812. In particular, the procreation and education of children no longer formed an integral part of marriage. In present-day perception, marriage was rather a permanent union encompassing all aspects of life. There was no objective justification for excluding same-sex couples from concluding marriage, all the more so since the European Court of Human Rights had acknowledged that differences based on sexual orientation required particularly weighty reasons. Other European countries either allowed same-sex marriages or had otherwise amended their legislation in order to give equal status to same-sex partnerships. On 12 December 2003 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicants’ complaint. The relevant parts of its judgment read as follows: “Neither the principle of equality set forth in the Austrian Federal Constitution nor the European Convention on Human Rights (as evidenced by “men and women” in Article 12) require that the concept of marriage as being geared to the fundamental possibility of parenthood should be extended to relationships of a different kind. (...) \\"The fact that same-sex relationships fall within the concept of private life and as such enjoy the protection of Article 8 of the ECHR – which also prohibits discrimination on non-objective grounds (Article 14 of the ECHR) – does not give rise to an obligation to change the law of marriage. \\"It is unnecessary in the instant case to examine whether, and in which areas, the law unjustifiably discriminates against same-sex relationships by providing for special rules for married couples. Nor is it the task of this court to advise the legislature on constitutional issues or even matters of legal policy.\\" \\"Instead, the complaint must be dismissed as ill- founded.”Verfassungsgerichtshof (VfGH), B777/03, 13.12.2003 Judgment = No violation of Article 12 of the Convention = The applicants claimed that Austria's failure to legally recognise same-sex marriages constituted a violation of Article 12 ECHR, which provides as follows: > “Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a > family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this > right.” The Court unanimously dismissed this claim: > \\"The Court notes that Article 12 grants the right to marry to “men and > women”. The French version provides « l’homme et la femme ont le droit de se > marier ». Furthermore, Article 12 grants the right to found a family. The > applicants argued that the wording did not necessarily imply that a man > could only marry a woman and vice versa. The Court observes that, looked at > in isolation, the wording of Article 12 might be interpreted so as not to > exclude the marriage between two men or two women. However, in contrast, all > other substantive Articles of the Convention grant rights and freedoms to > “everyone” or state that “no one” is to be subjected to certain types of > prohibited treatment. The choice of wording in Article 12 must thus be > regarded as deliberate. Moreover, regard must be had to the historical > context in which the Convention was adopted. In the 1950s marriage was > clearly understood in the traditional sense of being a union between > partners of different sex.\\"paras 54, 55 of the Judgment = No violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention = As a subsidiary argument, the applicants complained under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention that they had been discriminated against on account of their sexual orientation, since they were denied the right to marry. Addressing this part of the complaint, the ECHR pointed out the following: > \\"Insofar as the applicants appear to contend that, if not included in > Article 12, the right to marry might be derived from Article 14 taken in > conjunction with Article 8, the Court is unable to share their view. It > reiterates that the Convention is to be read as a whole and its Articles > should therefore be construed in harmony with one another. Having regard to > the conclusion reached above, namely that Article 12 does not impose an > obligation on Contracting States to grant same-sex couples access to > marriage, Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, a provision of > more general purpose and scope, cannot be interpreted as imposing such an > obligation either.\\"par. 101 of the Judgment The applicants also saw these articles as violated by lack of legal recognition of same-sex couples in Austria before 2010. The Court responded: > The Court cannot but note that there is an emerging European consensus > towards legal recognition of same-sex couples. Moreover, this tendency has > developed rapidly over the past decade. Nevertheless, there is not yet a > majority of States providing for legal recognition of same-sex couples. The > area in question must therefore still be regarded as one of evolving rights > with no established consensus, where States must also enjoy a margin of > appreciation in the timing of the introduction of legislative changes (..) > The Austrian Registered Partnership Act, which entered into force on 1 > January 2010, reflects the evolution described above and is thus part of the > emerging European consensus. Though not in the vanguard, the Austrian > legislator cannot be reproached for not having introduced the Registered > Partnership Act any earlierpar. 105-106 of the Judgment Judges Rozakis, Spielmann and Tulkens dissented in this respect, stating: > Having identified a “relevantly similar situation” (para. 99), and > emphasised that “differences based on sexual orientation require > particularly serious reasons by way of justification” (para. 97), the Court > should have found a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with > Article 8 of the Convention because the respondent Government did not > advance any argument to justify the difference of treatment, relying in this > connection mainly on their margin of appreciation (para. 80). However, in > the absence of any cogent reasons offered by the respondent Government to > justify the difference of treatment, there should be no room to apply the > margin of appreciation. Consequently, the “existence or non-existence of > common ground between the laws of the Contracting States” (para. 98) is > irrelevant as such considerations are only a subordinate basis for the > application of the concept of the margin of appreciation. Indeed, it is only > in the event that the national authorities offer grounds for justification > that the Court can be satisfied, taking into account the presence or the > absence of a common approach, that they are better placed than it is to deal > effectively with the matterPara. 8 of the joint dissent of Judges Rozakis, > Jebens and Tulkens = Obiter dictum on same-sex relations to be considered a form of \\"family life\\" = The Court, for the first time, has accepted same-sex relationships as a form of \\"family life\\". The statement runs as follows: > \\"...the Court’s case-law has only accepted that the emotional and sexual > relationship of a same-sex couple constitutes “private life” but has not > found that it constitutes “family life”, even where a long term relationship > of cohabiting partners was at stake. In coming to that conclusion, the Court > observed that despite the growing tendency in a number of European States > towards the legal and judicial recognition of stable de facto partnerships > between gay people, given the existence of little common ground between the > Contracting States, this was an area in which they still enjoyed a wide > margin of appreciation.'' (...) The Court notes that (...) a rapid evolution > of social attitudes towards same-sex couples has taken place in many member > States. Since then a considerable number of member States have afforded > legal recognition to same-sex couples (see above, paragraphs 27-30). Certain > provisions of EU law also reflect a growing tendency to include same-sex > couples in the notion of “family”(...). In view of this evolution the Court > considers it artificial to maintain the view that, in contrast to a > different-sex couple, a same-sex couple cannot enjoy “family life” for the > purposes of Article 8. Consequently the relationship of the applicants, a > cohabiting same-sex couple living in a stable de facto partnership, falls > within the notion of “family life”, just as the relationship of a different- > sex couple in the same situation would.\\"paras 99-94 of the Judgment However, this constitutes a mere obiter dictum that had no impact on the outcome of the case. = Obiter dictum on the scope of Article 12 in light of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights= Another obiter dictum of the Court concerns Article 8 of the EU Fundamental Rights Charter: > Regard being had to Article 8 of the Charter, therefore, the Court would no > longer consider that the right to marry enshrined in Article 12 must in all > circumstances be limited to marriage between two persons of the opposite > sex. Consequently, it cannot be said that Article 12 is inapplicable to the > applicants' complaintpara 61 of the Judgment Judge Malinverni in his concurrence has objected to this obiter dictum: > Article 12 is inapplicable to persons of the same sex. Admittedly, in > guaranteeing the right to marry, Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental > Rights of the European Union deliberately omitted any reference to men and > women, since it provides that “the right to marry and to found a family > shall be guaranteed in accordance with the national laws governing the > exercise of these rights”. In my opinion, however, no inferences can be > drawn from this as regards the interpretation of Article 12 of our > Convention. The commentary on the Charter does indeed confirm that the > drafters of Article 8 intended it to be broader in scope than the > corresponding articles in other international treaties. However, it should > not be forgotten that Article 8 of the Charter guarantees the right to marry > and to found a family “in accordance with the national laws governing the > exercise of these rights”. By referring in this way to the relevant domestic > legislation, Article 8 of the Charter simply leaves it to States to decide > whether they wish to afford homosexual couples the right to marry. However, > as the commentary quite rightly points out, “there is no obstacle to > recognize same-sex relationships in the context of marriage. There is, > however, no explicit requirement that domestic laws should facilitate such > marriages.” In my view, Article 8 of the Charter should therefore have no > bearing on the interpretation of Article 12 of the Convention as conferring > a right to marry only on persons of different sexespara. 2 of the concurring > opinion of Judge Malinverni =Separate opinions= Judges Rozakis, Jebens and Spielmann submitted a joint dissenting opinion, arguing that lack of legal recognition of same-sex couples in Austria before 2010 constituted violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8. Judge Malinverni, joined by judge Kovler, submitted a concurring opinion, arguing that Article 12 could under no circumstances be construed as referring to same-sex couples. = Request for referral to Grand Chamber = A request of the unsuccessful applicants to refer the case to a Grand Chamber was rejected by the Court.ECtHR press release no. 906 29.11.2010 See also * Recognition of same-sex unions in Europe * Recognition of same-sex unions in Austria Notes  External links  * ECtHR judgment 2010 in case law 2010 in LGBT history Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights European Court of Human Rights cases involving Austria Same-sex union case law ","title":"Schalk and Kopf v Austria"},{"id":"28948366","text":"Maria Faxell, née Caméen (1678-1738), was a Swedish vicar's wife who, according to legend, averted a Norwegian attack in Sweden during the Great Northern War.

It runs a total length of 623 km of which 91 km is within West Bengal and the remaining 532 km is in Odisha. It was declared a National Waterway in November 2008. The NW-5 consists of the stretches from Talcher to Dhamra on the Brahmani River a distance of 265 km including the Kharsua and Dhamra river systems, the Geonkhali–Charbatia stretch of the East Coast Canal of 217 km, the Charbatia–Dhamra stretch of Matai River of 40 km and the Mangalgadi–Paradip stretch of the Mahanadi River Delta running for 101 km. The waterway also includes a 91 km stretch in Bengal between Geonkhali and Nasirabad, West Bengal. A bill was introduced in Parliament on December 8, 2006, to declare these stretches as NW 5 and it was passed with amendments in 2008 and a sum of Rs. 1525 crore was allocated towards readying the identified waterways as the NW 5. When the project reaches its peak capacity by 2016, it is expected to handle over 18 million tonnes of cargo annually. The traffic on the NW 5 will consist largely of cargo such as coal, fertiliser, cement, iron ore and agricultural and industrial products that will be handled at four terminals— Talcher, Nasirabd, Balasore and Rajnagar. The transport of coal from Talcher to the Dhamra and Paradip ports is expected to contribute to the bulk of the traffic and it is estimated that the total tonnage will near 23 million tonnes in about 15 years from the completion of the project. Since the Brahmani River has a sharp river regime, 5 barrages are to be constructed on the river between Talcher and Jokadia to maintain a minimum draft. Each barrage will have navigational locks that allows for the passage of two 500 tonne vessels at a time. With the addition of NW 4 and NW 5, the total length of National Waterways in India became 4460 km.

His brother Li Shang, served as a general under the Han dynasty. Life Li Yiji was from Gaoyang, Chenliu (near present-day Kaifeng, Henan). He joined Liu Bang in around 207 BC when Liu rebelled against the Qin dynasty. Liu Bang's rebel army was preparing to attack the city of Chenliu, when Li Yiji came to Liu's camp and requested to see Liu, identifying himself as a Confucian scholar. Liu Bang disliked scholars and did not want to meet Li Yiji. Li Yiji was furious and he shouted at the sentry, \\"You go in and tell the Duke of Pei (Liu Bang) that I'm a drinker from Gaoyang, not a scholar!\\" Liu Bang was pleased when he heard that a drinker wanted to meet him and he immediately prepared a feast to welcome Li Yiji. Li Yiji chided Liu Bang for his rude behaviour upon meeting the latter. Liu Bang was embarrassed and he apologised, and then asked Li Yiji for ideas on how to conquer Chenliu. Li Yiji returned to Chenliu and attempted to persuade the magistrate to surrender to Liu Bang, but the magistrate refused. Li Yiji then led his men to kill the magistrate and sent a messenger to Liu Bang. Liu Bang led his army to attack Chenliu and the Qin soldiers gave up when they saw that the magistrate had been killed. Liu Bang gained more than 10,000 new troops and many supplies after conquering Chenliu. In 204 BC, during the Chu–Han Contention, when Liu Bang was besieged by Xiang Yu's forces in Xingyang, Li Yiji suggested to Liu Bang to recreate the former states of the Warring States period and install the descendants of their royal families on their respective thrones. This plan was intended to help Liu Bang gain the support of the vassal states' rulers, who would help him in the war against Xiang Yu. Liu Bang initially applauded Li Yiji's idea, but he dismissed Li's plan later after listening to Zhang Liang's opinion that the states were more likely to support Western Chu instead as Chu was superior to Han in terms of military might. Later that year, Li Yiji volunteered to persuade the rival Qi kingdom to surrender to Liu Bang. He travelled to Qi and managed to convince Tian Guang (King of Qi) to submit to Liu Bang. However, Liu Bang's general Han Xin, who was initially ordered to attack Qi, was unaware of the change in plan. Following the advice of Kuai Tong, Han Xin made a surprise attack on Qi and conquered Lixia and Linzi (the Qi capital). Tian Guang felt that Li Yiji had betrayed him and he had Li boiled alive. After Liu Bang became emperor and established the Han dynasty in 202 BC, he enfeoffed Li Yiji's son, Li Jie (), as the Marquis of Gaoliang ().

Early career  Bitterlich descended from several generations of foresters and did much of his early work in the Tyrolean Alps of Austria. Bitterlich Walter was the son of the forester Bitterlich Ernst and his wife Maria née Wachtel. He graduated from high school in Innsbruck and then studied in Salzburg. He actually wanted to be an artist. He graduated in 1930 as an engineer. In 1933 he passed with distinction the state examination for the Higher Forest Service. That same year he became a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. He then took no position, but worked as an unpaid volunteer at the Austrian Federal Forests (ÖBf) and took over forest management work in the Mayr-Melnhofschen Forest Service. He gained extensive experience in taxation, surveying and cartography in the forestry sector. From 1935 to 1938, until the beginning of World War II he worked as forester in his home town of Reutte. During World War II he served as part of the Wehrmacht between 1942 and 1943 on the Eastern Front and then in Normandy. He set down his war mémoires in the later decades of life, published in 2003 by Ehrenberg- Verlag as Persönliche Aufzeichnungen von 1942 bis 1945 During this time he considered how military thinking could be applied to forest trees.http://www.growthmodel.org/wmens/m2009/iles.ppt After the war he returned to his hometown of Reutte, and was not permitted to resume his former position by the ÖBf. So he moved with his family to his parents' in Salzburg. In 1946 he was working as a private forest in the Krupp estate administration in , where he tried his first ideas for Angle Count Sampling (ACS) in practice. He first published his idea for the inventory method in 1948, which caused a great stir in the scientific world. In 1949 he presented this as the \\"Bitterlich method\\" at the World Forestry Congress in Helsinki. In the same year his dissertation on the ACS method was accepted at the Vienna University of Natural Resources (BOKU) and Bitterlich thus gained his Dr. nat. tech. degree. In the following years, Bitterlich devoted primarily to his scientific work, and in 1948 was again a forester ÖBf, initially to 1953 in Zell am See, and then to 1967 in Hallein. In 1967 he was appointed as a full professor at BOKU. During this time in connection with his Angle Count Sampling method he developed the Spiegelrelaskop which made him world-famous. In Dr. Benno Hesske (around 1920 in Salzburg), he found from 1949/50 a congenial fellow, who helped to develop his inventions to production and make them then known worldwide. They were made initially at the company Optimar, from 1962, with his company, \\"Precision Optical Operating Company (FOB)\\". Bitterlich's methods are now used throughout the world and were included in all textbooks on forest and forest inventory gauging. Walter Bitterlich was married to Ilse. The couple had four children. Gerhard, Helga, Herwig and Sigrid. Bitterlich, who never drank alcohol and never smoked, was very athletic. His enthusiasm for gymnastics brought him under forestry colleagues entitled \\"forester giant wave\\" field. In addition, he used his artistic interests and talents and worked philosophically. Its relevant considerations he summarized in a \\"world morality\\" together. After many years of living in Salzburg and Hallein he returned to his hometown of Reutte, and died there in February 2008, ten days before his 100th Birthday.  Career  Bitterlich's diary documented his ideas on ACS as early as 1931.http://www.proaxis.com/~johnbell/itp/itpbitterlich_more.htm Bitterlich designed many patents throughout his career, which are used today throughout many forest inventories worldwide. He published articles in various journals and held patents on various inventions, not only in the field of forestry. Forestry studies and inventions included the Anglecount probe, the Bitterlich stick, the Spiegelrelaskop and Telerelaskop. Also were those in the field of surveying the collective measuring angle and an optical Baummesskluppe. In weapons technology and the development of light snow vehicles were some others. Bitterlich remained until well into old age active in inventing active and worked in his workshop on the development and enhancement of tree measuring devices. So he created the so-called circle segment for detecting irregular tree cross sections from 1996 and dealt with the development of its originating from the 1952 sighting angle measurement.

In 1990, the New 42nd Street was formed to oversee the redevelopment of seven neglected and historic theatres on 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, and to restore the block to a desirable tourist destination in Manhattan. The theatres were the Apollo Theatre, the Empire Theatre, the Liberty Theatre, the Lyric Theatre, the Selwyn Theatre, the Times Square Theatre, and the Victory Theater. *The Victory Theater was the first theater on the block to be restored, and reopened as the off-Broadway New Victory Theater in 1995. The New Victory Theater is programmed by the New 42nd Street with a focus on family entertainment, including international productions of theater, circus, puppetry, opera and dance for kids of all ages. The theater's programming is complemented by an award-winning educational program in New York City schools. *The Apollo and Lyric theatres were demolished, but sections were preserved for incorporation into a new 1,900-seat Broadway musical venue. On December 26, 1997, it opened as The Ford Center for the Performing Arts with the New York premiere of Ragtime. Subsequently, it was renamed the Hilton Theatre and later the Foxwoods Theatre. Following a takeover by the Ambassador Theatre Group, it has taken the Lyric Theatre name. *The Empire and Liberty became parts of an entertainment complex built by Forest City Ratner which includes the New York branch of Madame Tussauds Wax Museum and the Ripley's Believe It or Not! Odditorium. The shell of the Empire was physically lifted and moved closer to Eighth Avenue, becoming the lobby of an AMC Theatres cinema, which opened in 2000. *The Selwyn Theatre became the 750-seat American Airlines Theatre, reopening on July 27, 2000, following renovations, and is currently one of Roundabout Theatre Company's Broadway venues. *In 2011, Broadway 4D Theaters, LLC leased the Times Square Theater for a new multimedia Broadway- themed 4-D attraction; however, the project was cancelled. In 2018, developers announced the venue would be converted to retail space that would retain the proscenium, boxes, and many elements from the original structure. The work would take approximately two years at a cost of $100 million. The New 42nd Street also operates the New 42nd Street Building at 229 West 42nd Street, designed by the firm of Platt Byard Dovell, which opened in 2000 and is home to the New 42nd Street Studios as well as The Duke on 42nd Street - a 199-seat black box theater named for Doris Duke - and three floors of office spaces used by seven non-profit performing arts organizations, including the New 42nd Street.

In the game, Reeg landers search the landscape for canisters. If a lander grabs a canister and makes it to the top of the screen, it turns into a mutant. The player must shoot the enemy ship to release a grabbed canister, but if it falls too far, then it's destroyed on impact. There are also other ships such as cruisers, which when hit, unleash buzzer ships. The player has smart bombs available which destroy all on-screen enemies. On the higher levels there are additional enemy ships such as mine layers which are capable of launching killer ships, unless the player can destroy them quickly. If the player allows destruction of all canisters, then a hoard of mutants attack and the landscape completely disappears.

The Senga are a tribe who migrated from the southern part of present-day Congo DRC. They re-settled in the Luangwa valley amongst the Tumbuka speaking people. The language they speak though similar to Tumbuka is distinct and also shares a common strain with Bisa/Bemba. Origins What the Senga can tell of their past begins with migration to their present home perhaps three centuries ago. There is unanimous agreement that their former home was a place called Uluwa which all evidence suggests was in what now is known as Katanga. There is evidence to suggest that prior to this time the Senga had no separate identity but were part of a larger group. Donald Fraser who visited part of Senga land in 1897 takes the view that the Senga are a composite tribe partly of Tumbuka and Partly of Bisa Origin. But Senga tradition maintains that they were a separate group who broke away from the same chief (possibly Mwata Yamvo) as the Bisa and Bemba but at a different time. The Senga relate Passing through Bisa country – Led by Chibeza Kambombo, the leader of the main group in the migration who was given a young girl for a wife by one of the Bisa Chiefs. Politics Among the Senga political hierarchy is senior chief, chief, group headman (headman over more than one village) and the village headman. Like all Senga chiefs the senior chief inherits his position. Unlike some of them he inherits from his maternal uncle (a matrilineal system). The principal clans are Goma, Ng’uni, kumwenda, Nyirenda, Lungu, Zimba and Miti. Headmen like the chiefs are said to be selected from members of the chiefs clan (Goma Clan for the senior chiefs area). Senior chiefs usually are headmen before being senior chiefs. While these clans in Zambia are matrilineal in nature, the same tribes which are based in Malawi have a patrilineal lineage. The Nyirendas, Kumwendas, Lungus, Zimbas who migrated to Malawi have had a partineal system of chieftainship. The person who becomes a chief of the village is the first- born son or eldest son where a girl is the first born in the royal family. In Malawi, these tribes are found predominantly in the northern districts of Malawi. However some clans have moved to various other districts in recent years because of work. Today the Senga reside in Chama district of Muchinga province under the leadership of Senior Chief Kambombo. Other Chiefs that are under Senior Chief Kambombo includes; Chief Chifunda, Chief Chikwa and Chief Tembwe.

It was originally broadcast on BBC Three on 20 November 2009, later repeated on BBC One on 25 November. The episode was written by David Farr, and directed by Sam Miller. In the episode one of Lucas North's (Richard Armitage) former interrogators, FSB officer Oleg Darshavin (Emil Hostina), approaches Lucas regarding an upcoming terrorist attack. The episode also continues the story-arc of \\"Nightingale\\", a shadow organisation bent on a New World Order, and reveals that CIA liaison Sarah Caufield is a part of it. A little over five million people tuned in to watch the episode following its BBC One broadcast. It was met with generally positive reviews. Plot The episode begins with Ros Myers (Hermione Norris) haunted by the death of Jo Portman (Miranda Raison) from the previous episode; Jo held a terrorist long enough for Ros to shoot him, though the bullet passed through him and entered her chest. Meanwhile, Oleg Darshavin breaks out of an immigration detention facility following a riot. As Section D review the CCTV footage, Lucas quickly recognises Darshavin, who mouths Lucas' name, indicating he intends for them to meet. Lucas reminisces that during his imprisonment in Russia, he developed a bond with Darshavin and mentioned wanting to go birdwatching in the Thames Estuary. During the meeting alone, Darshavin reveals he knows of a planned terrorist attack by Sudanese extremists and will reveal the time and location in exchange for a passport and one million pounds in mixed currencies. Throughout the episode, Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) believes Lucas developed Stockholm syndrome during his capture. His suspicions are solidified when Lucas takes off his wire and goes off the radar while walking to meet him again with the passport. The two meet in Lucas' flat, where Darshavin reveals the leader of the cell goes by Omar Salim al Khaled. Their meeting is then disrupted when his girlfriend, CIA liaison Sarah Caufield (Genevieve O'Reilly), enters. Lucas is angered to discover she is attempting to bug his flat and pushes her out; Darshavin would later kidnap her. Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker) and Tariq Masood (Shazad Latif) looks into this and finds a link between al Khaled and Onelight, a charity front he used to recruit members. One of Malcolm Wynn-Jones' former assets, who is in hiding out of fear from the terrorist, left Ruth subtle clues leading to the time and location of the attack. Ros locates al Khaled's residence, but witnesses him getting killed by a sniper. The bug in his flat revealed that in a phone conversation just before the hit, Lucas discovers that Darshavin was the killer, and is a part of the cell. He later receives a call from Darshavin, threatening to kill Sarah if he does not deliver the money. As Ros races to stop the bomb going off at the Square Mile, Lucas meets up with Darshavin back at the Estuary, and is able to break him into revealing the disarming code, before Lucas delivers him back to the FSB. Before he is delivered however, Darshavin attempts to bargain his way out by revealing details of a secret meeting in Basel, Switzerland from \\"Nightingale\\", something Harry is already aware of in a previous episode. In a secondary story, Harry asks London's CIA director Samuel Walker (Brian Protheroe) for help on looking into the meeting. During his investigation, he discovers that one of his officers is involved. Before he can find out who, Sarah kills Walker by pushing Walker off the top floor of the building. This reveals that Sarah is a member of Nightingale. Production The stunt where Walker fell to his death was filmed at the London Ark. The episode includes more shots of Richard Armitage wearing tattoos, which takes two hours to apply \\"on a good day.\\" However, they tend to \\"break up if you sweat.\\" Armitage was told to stand still and \\"not touch anything\\", and they \\"rub off on the sheets.\\" Several scenes were filmed involving Lucas' interrogation, though only some of those scenes were included into the final episode. The scene where Sarah pushed Walker was filmed at the top floor of the London Ark; the producers thought that particular building was suitable to carry out the scene. The stunt took three hours to set up. To use Protheroe as much as possible, a breakaway balcony was used. The stunt was performed by Gordon Seed, who performed an 80-foot fall before, but onto water. Because of the building's layout, it was impractical to use wires, so Seed had to perform a free fall onto an air bag at the bottom. Beforehand, a weights were dropped down until the crew were satisfied Seed would survive the fall. Four separate camera angles were used to shoot the scene. Broadcast and reception The episode originally aired on BBC Three on 20 November 2009, and later repeated on frontline channel BBC One on 25 November, both cases airing during the 9pm to 10pm timeslot. Though there is no available data concerning the ratings following the BBC Three broadcast, the BBC One broadcast received total viewing figures of 5.18 million, making Spooks the thirteenth most seen programme for BBC One, and 34th overall in British television the week it aired Vicky Frost of The Guardian thought the introduction was \\"a relatively tame start to proceedings\\", and that the episode was \\"tightly plotted, deft and exciting\\", and the final twist was \\"marvellous\\", but believed that there were \\"one too many plots for an hour of Spooks\\", and that the backstory of Lucas \\"all seemed rather a missed opportunity.\\" Robert McLaughlin of Den of Geek noted that Lucas \\"spends a lot of this episode in a state of undress\\", and that while it was \\"a more personal episode, there are some huge implications set up and executed for the rest of the series, and while it might seem a waste of momentum to re-tread the imprisonment of Lucas from the beginning of last season, all the flashbacks, dabs of information and the entire setup are all relevant\\", concluding by stating that \\"Spooks continues to be one of the best shows the Beeb currently offers.\\" References External links * Series 8, Episode 4 at bbc.co.uk  Episode 4 at TV.com 8.04 2009 British television episodes ","title":"Series 8, Episode 4 (Spooks)"},{"id":"28948586","text":"Pseudopostega pexa is a moth of the family Opostegidae.

Directed by Kirk Browning, it was produced by PBS affiliate WNET in New York. Black-and-white papier-mâché costumes aimed to re- create the book's original artwork by John Tenniel. The production was not recorded on film, but on videotape. It starred Kate Burton as Alice, and her father, Richard Burton, as the White Knight. Other notable roles included Nathan Lane as the Mouse, Geoffrey Holder as the Cheshire Cat, Andre De Shields as Tweedledum, and Eve Arden as the Queen of Hearts. The production was a revival of actress-director Eva Le Gallienne and Florida Friebus's famous 1932 stage adaptation of Lewis Carroll's novel. It had been presented on Broadway in 1982 with Ms. Burton in the lead, but with an otherwise different cast featuring the Mirror Repertory Company. The videotaping was not made in a theatre with a live audience, but in a television studio, much as the 1960 version of Peter Pan had been years before. The Le Gallienne-Friebus adaptation had previously served as the unofficial basis for the all-star 1933 Paramount Pictures film version of the novel, which featured Charlotte Henry as Alice. The stage production was successfully revived on Broadway in 1947 with Bambi Linn in the title role, and an abridged 6-record 78-RPM album featuring the revival's cast was made by RCA Victor. The 1983 TV adaptation of the stage production was not the first. It had previously been telecast in 1955 by NBC, as part of the Hallmark Hall of Fame.

It combines an agricultural exhibition, several industrial and retail offerings, and a range of entertainment facilities. The Windhoek Show was first held in 1899 and is since 1966 conducted annually. Held during the first week of October, the Windhoek Show is the biggest industrial and agricultural exhibition in Namibia. It attracts close to 100,000 visitors per year. History The first Windhoek Show was held in 1899 when the country, then known as German South-West Africa, was still a colony of Imperial Germany. At that time it was exclusively an agricultural exhibition. Subsequent fairs were held in 1902, 1910, 1913, and 1914. After the end of World War I, South-West Africa came under South African administration which organised its first post-war Windhoek Show in 1930. In 1934 the Windhoek Show Grounds were laid out, an area between Windhoek's city centre and the Suiderhof suburb, next to today's Maerua Mall. These show grounds were designed primarily to house the Windhoek Industrial and Agricultural Show but the next fair was only held in 1954, and one more show in 1964. A 1961 fair was scheduled but had to be canceled due to a Foot-and- mouth disease outbreak. During that time the industrial sector was incorporated; originally only through businesses that supplied the agricultural sector but subsequently including a larger portfolio. From 1966 onwards the Windhoek Show became an annual event. Further expansion attempts through splitting several smaller thematic shows from the main event did not become economically viable and were soon discontinued.

Central New York (consisting of the Syracuse Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Utica-Rome Metropolitan Statistical Area) is a six county area-Cayuga, Herkimer, Madison, Oneida, Onondaga, and Oswego. The entire area was nominally under the jurisdiction of Albany County from 1686 until the Royal Proclamation of 1763 but truly under the Iroquois Confederacy until 1777. The area was then nominally Tryon County from 1781 and effectively in 1784 when the county was renamed Montgomery, and then the area was part of Herkimer County from 1791. left In 1794 the western section of Herkimer County was split off as Onondaga County, and then in 1798 the northwestern section of Herkimer was removed as Oneida County and the southwestern section as Chenango County. Cayuga County was removed from Onondaga in 1799, Madison County from Chenango in 1806, and Oswego from Onondaga and Oneida in 1816. The current towns of Herkimer, Oneida, and Madison counties are descended from the original districts and towns of Montgomery County; whereas the towns of Onondaga and Cayuga counties are descended from the towns erected by the state when Onondaga County was formed from the Military Tract in western Herkimer County which had previously been divided into townships for the purpose of surveying of lands to be sold to veterans of the US Revolutionary War. New York experimented with different types of municipalities before settling upon the current format of towns and cities occupying all the land in a county, and all previous forms were transformed into towns (or divided into multiple towns) in 1788 when all of the state of New York was divided into towns. Some early forms of government in earlier years included land patents with some municipal rights, districts, precincts, and boroughs. Though originally intended to be mere “…involuntary subdivisions of the state, constituted for the purpose of the more convenient exercise of governmental functions by the state for the benefit of all its citizens” as defined by the courts in 1916 (Short v. Town of Orange), towns gained home rule powers from the state in 1964, at which time towns became \\"a municipal corporation comprising the inhabitants within its boundaries, and formed with the purpose of exercising such powers and discharging such duties of local government and administration of public affairs as have been, or, maybe [sic] conferred or imposed upon it by law.” The following is a timeline showing the creation of the current towns from their predecessors stretching back to the earliest municipal entity over the area. The timelines only represent from which town(s) a particular town was created from and does not represent annexations of territory to and from towns that already existed. All municipalities are towns unless otherwise noted as patent, township, borough, district, or city.

Three more townships were created in order to settle all claims. Originally simply numbered, they latter received names, mostly classical Greek and Roman names.

Rehab popularized the pool party concept in Las Vegas, leading other resorts to begin offering their own versions. Its success also spawned a reality television series, Rehab: Party at the Hard Rock Hotel, which aired from 2008 to 2010. Description Rehab was similar to a spring break party, and each event featured DJ music. Rehab also featured live performances throughout its history, from musicians such as Akon, Snoop Dogg, Drake, Lil Wayne, Lady Gaga, Deadmau5, Pauly D, and Psy. Aside from the cost of admission, alcohol and cabanas were offered for additional costs. Rehab parties were held on Sundays. The event operated during warm seasons, usually starting in April. It would typically end each year in October, depending on the weather. History Before Rehab was launched, the Hard Rock Hotel pool was not open to the public and was only accessible to resort guests. In 2004, Chad Pallas, the director of nightlife for the Hard Rock, was looking for ways to keep the resort popular. He focused on improving the pool area and got the idea for Rehab after having one of his weekly boat parties on Lake Mead. Pallas later said, \\"It was the greatest time ever to get out there in that cheap pontoon boat and party during the day. I had just come home and was relaxing one day when I got a call from a girl who wanted to get a group of her friends into the resort pool. She said she couldn't just walk in, that they had grown more strict, yet I was going to meetings where we were complaining that pool business was down.\\" The pool area had sometimes hosted private concerts and special events. Pallas had seen Nikki Beach in Miami, but he was not certain that such an idea could work in Las Vegas, so adjustments were made to the concept to suit the locale. Pallas said about Rehab, \\"At first we made the mistake of thinking it was more of the electronic [music] scene, but the crowd that came showed us it was more of a Spring Break party scene.\\" Rehab opened to the public on May 2, 2004, and Pallas hoped that the event could bring in revenue of $20,000 on its opening day. The first party proved to be successful, bringing in $90,000, and the event brought in profits of $1.5 million by the end of its first season in 2004. Following its initial success, the event returned the following year. Rehab was initially popular among local residents, including those who worked in nearby resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. Word about the Rehab parties gradually spread to tourists, and the event pioneered the local trend of daylife (or dayclub) entertainment, similar to nightlife. Celebrity visitors over the years included Rob Gronkowski, Justin Bieber, Paris Hilton, and Kim Kardashian. Rehab's initial success was partly due to the lack of competition. By 2007, its popularity had inspired other Las Vegas resorts to begin offering similar pool party events. By 2008, yearly profits had reached $9 million. Lines would form hours prior to the opening of a Rehab party. As of 2008, the event had capacity for 2,000 people, and lines would sometimes reach into the casino once capacity was hit. VIP customers could skip the line and enter through a separate entrance. Rehab's popularity led to a reality television show titled Rehab: Party at the Hard Rock Hotel, which premiered in 2008. As of 2009, Rehab averaged 2,000 to 2,500 guests during each party, although some busy weekends attracted up to 5,000 people. Cabana rentals ranged from $1,000 to $10,000 depending on how busy each party was. Rehab in 2009 By 2009, drugs and prostitution had become an issue at resort pools in the Las Vegas Valley. That year, detectives with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department launched an undercover operation at Rehab. They subsequently arrested seven people on narcotic-related charges, while another was arrested for solicitation of prostitution. The arrests prompted the Nevada Gaming Control Board to investigate aspects of the pool operation, to determine whether such crimes were commonly occurring on the property. In 2010, Hard Rock Cafe International sued the Hard Rock Hotel to cancel its name licensing agreement, citing negative publicity associated with Rehab and its reality television series. The lawsuit alleged that the resort was being portrayed on television as \\"a destination that revels in drunken debauchery, acts of vandalism, sexual harassment, violence, criminality and a host of other behavior\\". The lawsuit also cited the 2009 arrests. Rehab: Party at the Hard Rock was canceled later in 2010. Pool area in 2013 In 2011, Ian Kohoutek became the director of nightlife and launched an effort to help Rehab's public image following the lawsuit. Kohoutek said about the television series, \\"I think it was a poor depiction of what Rehab is all about. This is actually a very fun, clean environment. We have a clean pool; we operate effectively and by the law.\\" At the time, Rehab offered 22 daybeds and 51 cabanas. Describing the success of Rehab, Kohoutek said, \\"People want to come out and get some sun by the pool no matter what, but making it a nightclub atmosphere just entices them more. Everybody wants to party and they want to be in the sun while they do it.\\" Rehab remained popular a decade after its opening. Aside from pool renovations and expansions, the event stayed largely the same over the years, a fact that the Hard Rock Hotel cited as a reason for Rehab's success. In 2013, Rehab hosted a bikini contest called the Bikini Invitational, which became a yearly event at Rehab. New bungalows were added to the event in 2015, followed by a revamped stage in 2016. In June 2018, it was announced that Rehab would come to an end later that year, as new owners prepared to renovate the Hard Rock and rebrand it as Virgin Hotels Las Vegas. Rehab held its final pool party on October 14, 2018.

Despite its 65+ years of existence in India, the profession has gained momentum in the healthcare sector of India only in the recent years.  Beginning years  The first department of occupational therapy (OT) was established at the King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEM) in Mumbai, India in 1950. The founder of the ‘OT profession in India’ as well as the ‘first school of OT in India/Asia’ was Mrs. Kamala V. Nimbkar [1] [nee Elizabeth Lundy]. Mrs. Nimbhkar was a social activist who spent her early 30s at Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram. She became interested in OT when she came across an article written by Ms. Helen Willard, a notable occupational therapist in the United States. Dr. Nimbhkar went to the US to study OT at the Philadelphia School of OT at the age of 45. After passing the OT board exam in February 1948 she returned to India and persuaded the KEM Hospital Administration to start the OT department. Mrs. Nimbkar was also the founder and first president of the All India Occupational Therapists Association, which is one of the founding member organizations of the World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT). Mrs. Nimbhkar was also the first editor of the Indian Journal of Occupational Therapy in its beginning years. Mrs. Nimbkar retired in 1957 from the Occupational Therapy School at KEM Hospital and established the second OT school at Nagpur in 1958.  1960–1980s  Subsequent decades saw the emergence of a few OT diploma educational programs in the states of Bihar [Bihar College of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy - 1966], New Delhi [PDU Institute for the Physically Handicapped - 1960; College of Occupational Therapy, AIIMS - 1971], Tamil Nadu [Occupational Therapy School at Christian Medical College - 1969], and Uttar Pradesh [Occupational Therapy School at King George's Medical School - 1970; Occupational Therapy School at Institute of Engineering and Technology - 1981].  Age of notable growth  Occupational therapy's stature began to grow when diploma level educational programs transitioned to baccalaureate level programs in late 1980s. The last decade of the 20th century was a golden decade for OT in India as 13 new baccalaureate level OT programs were established in India between 1990 and 2000. Many schools were established in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The number of OT educational programs continued to rise in early 2000. The length of the baccalaureate degree was increased from 3.5 years to 4.5 years in the late 1990s. Institutions also began to offer OT at a master's level (ranging 2–3 years) beginning late 1990s. Since 2012, doctoral level [PhD] OT degrees are also being offered in India. The demand for OT professionals in India has gathered momentum in the past decade. Indian OT professionals work in a variety of practice settings including government and private hospitals, multi-specialty hospitals, rehabilitation centers, non-governmental organizations, special schools, outpatient clinics, and academic institutions. Many OTs in India run their own outpatient clinics. Due to the excessive demand for OT professionals all over the world, graduates of OT programs in India comprise a notable part of India's diaspora.  Entry-level requirements  To practice OT in India, one must graduate with a baccalaureate level degree in OT (BOT). One must also fulfil other applicable regulatory requirements such as obtaining a registration certificate from the council (if one is established in the state) before starting to practice. Currently, more than 30 schools offer OT courses in India.  Occupational therapy schools in India  A few well-known institutes that run BOT courses in India are as followsBOT Institutes http://www.indicareer.com/colleges-for-BPT%20and%20BOT- degree.html # Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu #JKKMMRF College of Occupational therapy, Tamil Nadu #NIEPMD, Chennai, Tamil Nadu # National Institute for locomotor disabilities, Kolkata, West Bengal, India # All India Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Haji Ali, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India # Swami Vivekanand National Institute of Rehabilitation Training and Research (SVNIRTAR), Cuttack, Odisha, India # Pt.

However, efforts are underway to create a national level council. The All India Occupational Therapists Association offers voluntary registration with its Academic Council for interested OT practitioners in India. The State of Maharashtra and the Union Territory of Delhi legally require OT practitioners to register themselves with the respective councils (The Delhi Council for Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy & Maharashtra State Occupational and Physiotherapy Council).

Library The first library on the island of Kauai was probably established by Reverend John Mortimer Lydgate in 1900 at his church in Līhuʻe. After moving to a temporary home in 1921, a permanent home was needed. On February 3, 1922, Emma Kauikeolani Wilcox, widow of businessman and politician Albert Spencer Wilcox (1844–1919) offered US$75,000 for a public library on Kauai. In October 1922 architect Hart Wood was selected to design the building named in honor of Wilcox. Built with John Hansen as general contractor, it opened in 1924 to house the first public library on the island. Museum In April 1954 a committee started raising funds for a museum to be built next to the library. Juliet Rice Wichman (1901–1987) was chair of the committee. A granddaughter of businessman and politician William Hyde Rice, she had married Frederick Warren Wichman after the death of her first husband Holbrook M. Goodale. The new building was designed by architect Kenneth Roehrig and named for Rice. Wichman became the museum's first director, and would later co-found the National Tropical Botanical Garden and donate land to become the Limahuli Garden and Preserve to the garden. The first manager of the museum was Dora Jane Isenberg Cole (1917–1988), a second cousin of Wichman sharing great-grandfather William Harrison Rice (1813–1862) but Paul Isenberg (1837–1903) as her paternal grandfather. On December 3, 1960, the museum opened to the public in the Rice building. In 1969 the state of Hawaii built a new library building, and the Wilcox building was converted to house additional exhibits of the Kauai Museum, opening in December 1970. Preservation The Wilcox building was listed as state historic site 30-11-9344 on February 17, 1979.

A big part of the subdivision forms the Krishnanagar-Santipur Plain, which occupies the central part of the district. The Jalangi, after flowing through the middle of the subdivision, turns right and joins the Bhagirathi. On the south-east, the Churni separates the Krishnanagar-Santipur Plain from the Ranaghat-Chakdaha Plain. The east forms the boundary with Bangladesh.The subdivision is moderately urbanized. 20.795% of the population lives in urban areas and 79.205% lives in rural areas.

He isn't the least bit perturbed, for example, when his lovely wife Julie (Rosalind Russell) is the object of desire in the eyes of the school's football star, Rubber Legs Ryan (Gordon Jones). John goes to New York to meet with publisher Elliott Morgan (Van Heflin), and meets associate Nellie Woods (Kay Francis), who loves Elliott, but can't get him to commit. Elliott is infatuated with John's wife Julie, but after a while, he realizes that she is faithful to her husband. Julie, though, continues to be irked at John's complete lack of jealousy. A misunderstanding leads to John being placed under arrest. Elliott's failure to help him or to contact lawyer Freddie Bond, as promised, is maddening to Julie, who wants John to knock his block off. She also catches John and Nellie in an embrace, and turns red with jealous rage, which puzzles John because they were merely celebrating his book sale. Nellie's threat to quit finally gets Elliott to propose, but one day, John finally explodes and strikes him, which leads to a fight between the two women, too.

The principal town is Myinmu which lies on the northern bank of the Irrawaddy River. History of Myinmu is closely linked to the World War II against the Japanese Army when British General Sir Douglas Gracey occupied the town after crossing the Irrawaddy River. The nearest settlement to the town of Myinmu is Paledan, a river village to the east. Other settlements of note in the township are Allagappa to the west, Tizaung to the northeast and Ngaizun several miles away on the opposite side of the river from the main town. Apart from the Irrawaddy River, the Mu River also flows about away from the town. The nearest airport to the town is the Mandalay International Airport (MDL), which is away. Geography Myinmu Township has an area of about . It has about 35 village tracts. Road bridge on Mu River on the right bank of Myinmu Mu River in the north-central Myanmar, runs on the right bank of Myinmu Township and joins the Irrawaddy River on the south, near this town; the river has a length of 175 km The river is navigable for boats up to Shebo District. The Kabo Weir across this river is used to cross for approaching the Shwebo Irrigation Project which was built to meet the irrigation needs of this Dry Zone. The Kabo Weir however, was constructed by the British colonial administration between 1901–1907. History Myingu township was occupied by Portuguese missionaries in the late 19th century who established Roman Catholic mission stations at Nabet and Chaungu. One of the earliest cooperatives in Burma was established in Myinmu Township in March 1905 with 19 members. Patterned on the Schulze–Delitzsch Cooperative Credit Society established in 1850, that lead to 16 similar societies getting set up in other parts of Burma. However, these credit societies had to closed own under stiff competition from the 55 societies of the Reiffeisen type, which were concerned mostly with agricultural credits to meet farmers’ needs. Myinmu was occupied by the British Indian Army during the Burma Campaign against the Japanese in 1944. Douglas Gracey occupied Myinmu on February 13, 1944 and crossed the Irrawaddy. Economy Myinmu and the surrounding township rely on agriculture for their livelihoods and are located relatively close to the market in Mandalay. The principal crop is rice and farmers in the township have been reported to have devised new ways to reduce weed problems by replacing alternate wet-seeded rice with transplanted rice. In the past, the popular variety of Rice was not grown in Myinmu. Jowar (locally in Burmese language “pyaung”), called the great millet was grown in the dry zones of Singiang District, which was the staple food of people in Myinmu and Myotha towns. There are two varieties of Jowar namely, the Sanpyaung, the whitish green variety and the Kunpayung. The whitish green variety has large stalks. The edible part of this variety is also used as substitute to rice. The agricultural economy of the township got a boost with assistance provided by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to rear pigs and grow mushrooms under a cooperative pilot project launched by the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, the Ministry of Cooperatives and the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, as a poverty alleviation programme in the dry zone under a development study on sustainable agriculture and rural development. Further, an irrigation project was built to provide irrigation facilities to of land, which enabled double cropping on the lands with mixed crops. The earth dam ( in height and long) built for the purpose is called the Letpan Dam, which created a storage of to provide for irrigation.

The coil–globule transition is of importance in biology due to the presence of coil-globule transitions in biological macromolecules such as proteins and DNA. It is also analogous with the swelling behavior of a crosslinked polymer gel and is thus of interest in biomedical engineering for controlled drug delivery. A particularly prominent example of a polymer possessing a coil-globule transition of interest in this area is that of Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)(PNIPAAm). Description In its coil state, the radius of gyration of the macromolecule scales as its chain length to the three-fifths power. As it passes through the coil–globule transition, it shifts to scaling as chain length to the half power (at the transition) and finally to the one third power in the collapsed state. The direction of the transition is often specified by the constructions 'coil-to- globule' or 'globule-to-coil' transition. Origin This transition is associated with the transition of a polymer chain from good solvent behavior through ideal or Theta solvent behavior to poor solvent behavior. The canonical coil–globule transition is associated with the Upper critical solution temperature and the associated Flory theta point. In this case, collapse occurs with cooling and results from favorable attractive energy of the polymer to itself. A second type of coil–globule transition is instead associated with the lower critical solution temperature and its corresponding theta point. This collapse occurs with increasing temperature and is driven by an unfavorable entropy of mixing. An example of this type is embodied by the polymer PNIPAAM, mentioned above. Coil globule transitions may also be driven by charge effects, in the case of polyelectrolytes. In this case pH and ionic strength changes within the solution may trigger collapse, with increasing counterion concentration generally leading to collapse in a uniformly charged polyelectrolyte. In polyampholytes containing both positive and negative charges, the opposite may hold true.

The arena is the second-largest venue for the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam tennis tournament of the calendar year. Naming rights Former logo (2008–18) During construction of the arena and throughout the 2006 Commonwealth Games, the arena was originally referred to as the Melbourne Park Multi-Purpose Venue. When it opened in 2000, a sponsor was immediately assigned naming rights and it became known as the Vodafone Arena. This arrangement lasted for eight years. On 12 May 2008, it was announced that its name would change to Hisense Arena in a multimillion-dollar six-year deal. In 2014 this was extended for a further three years. Despite the contract ending at the conclusion of 2017, the multinational Hisense retained naming rights for several more months. Then in August 2018, Tennis Australia announced it had bought the naming rights and had elected to call the venue Melbourne Arena, saying it preferred a non-commercial title \\"iconic with the city\\". The non-corporate name is in effect for five years, though the State Government and Tennis Australia have not ruled out extending the arena's name beyond that period. On 3 February 2020, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced that, in the near future, the arena would be renamed John Cain Arena in honour of John Cain, the 41st Premier of Victoria, regarded as a critical figure in keeping the Australian Open in Melbourne in the mid 1980s. History Construction of Melbourne Arena commenced in the late 1990s, and was completed in 2000. The arena features a cycling track, which is covered over with seating for court events. The tennis court is a GreenSet surface (between 2008 and 2019 the surface was plexicushion) and the roof is retractable, making it one of the few venues where tennis can be played during rain. The venue is able to hold a maximum spectator capacity of 11,000 for events such as music concerts where general floor seating or standing room is available. For basketball, netball and tennis the capacity is 10,500. When the velodrome is in use the northern and southern banks of seats, which cover the turns of the velodrome, are raised to reveal the track while the floor seating is removed leaving a reduced capacity of 4,500. The arena has been used for netball for Melbourne Phoenix and Melbourne Kestrels games in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy. Melbourne Phoenix and the Melbourne Kestrels played their last home game there before merging to become the Melbourne Vixens who used it for home games in the ANZ Championship until 2016. Since 2017 the Vixens and new team the Magpies use the arena in the National Netball League. The largest netball attendance at the arena was on 20 November 2004 when 10,300 saw the Australian national team defeat New Zealand 53 to 51. Following the renovation of the Margaret Court Arena as part of a A$363 million upgrade to Melbourne Park in time for the 2015 Australian Open, which included a retractable roof and an increase in capacity from 6,000 to 7,500, both Melbourne United (formerly the Melbourne Tigers) and the Melbourne Vixens announced their intentions to move from the arena to the smaller capacity Margaret Court Arena from 2015. However, Melbourne United abandoned their move to MCA after the 2015–16 NBL season and continue to play the majority of their games at Melbourne Arena (United play some games at the State Netball and Hockey Centre when the Australian Open takes place each January), while the Vixens will continue to split their games between Melbourne and Margaret Court Arenas with Melbourne used for games expected to attract a larger crowd. Events =Australian Open= Every year, the venue hosts many matches as part of the Australian Open tennis tournament. It was usually only been used for day matches in the first 10 days of the tournament. In 2012 the venue began hosting night matches during the first week of the tournament, at the same time as matches being played on the adjacent Rod Laver Arena. The first Australian Open match played at the venue was on 15 January 2001 and lasted less than ten minutes, when Monica Seles advanced to the second round after Brie Rippner was felled with injury in the second game of the match. The first match completed on the court was Tim Henman's first round win over Hicham Arazi. =Basketball= Melbourne Arena is the main home court of National Basketball League (NBL) teams Melbourne United and South East Melbourne Phoenix. Formerly, the Victoria Titans and South Dragons used it as their home, until high rental prices forced the teams to find other venues. Until this move the venue was largely devoid of sporting events outside of the two weeks of the Australian Open tennis tournament held each January. The Dragons, founded in 2006 until they withdrew from the competition after winning the championship in 2009, played three seasons at the arena. For the 2012–13 NBL season, the Tigers (now renamed Melbourne United) returned to the venue, played 7 of their 13 home games at the arena. They later shifted all home matches to the venue. The Phoenix, who made their debut in the 2019–20 NBL season, share their home with Melbourne Arena and the State Basketball Centre in Wantirna South. The largest basketball crowd was on 4 December 2016 during the 2016–17 NBL season when 10,300 fans saw Melbourne United defeat the New Zealand Breakers 98–74. This broke the previous basketball attendance record of 9,308 set in 2008 in a local derby game between the South Dragons and Melbourne Tigers.Austadiums - NBL: Melbourne vs New Zealand 2016 The facility co-hosted the 2007 FIBA Oceania Championship where the Australian national basketball team won the gold medal. =Netball= Netball is played regularly at the venue. It is the home court of the Melbourne Vixens and Collingwood Magpies in the Suncorp Super Netball competition. The Australian Diamonds sometime play home international fixtures at the venue. The venue also hosted the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Fast5 Netball World Series. =Commonwealth Games= During the 2006 Commonwealth Games the stadium was used for basketball and other sports. Its name was changed to Multi-Purpose Venue with all Vodafone- related signage covered over with black shrouds because Telstra, a competitor of Vodafone, was a major sponsor of the games. =Cycling= In 2004 and 2012, the UCI Track Cycling World Championships were held at the venue. =Ice hockey= On 14 and 15 June 2013, the venue played host to an ice hockey exhibition series between teams representing the United States and Canada.Showbiz Sport comes to Melbourne =Entertainment= The arena hosts several musical and entertainment events each year, in concert with other venues in the precinct. On 26 February 2007, Irish boy band Westlife held a concert for The Love Tour supporting their LP The Love Album. On 18 September 2018, Taiwanese vocal pop band Mayday held a concert for Life Tour supporting their album History of Tomorrow. From 2011 to 2013 the venue hosted the Melbourne judges' audition stages of the Seven Network singer search program The X Factor.

Heinz Bondy led the school for 25 years until it closed in 1975.Colman McCarthy, The Soul of a School, The Washington Post, May 4, 1996 Operated according to progressive education principles, the school was unusually democratic in its governance, with a student government that was empowered to make all nonacademic rules. As of 1970, there was no dress code, student publications were not censored, and there were no restrictions on student political activities. The school's philosophy held that the exercise of freedom would help students become responsible, self-directing people.

She was fluent and literate in Latin (her main area of study) along with many other languages. She is most notable for her many translations of published works to Danish, particularly her 1,000-page translation of Latin moral philosopher Seneca.  Life  Birgitte was born in 1610 to the nobleman Christen Thott and Sophie Below in Turebygård. She was the sister of Henrik Thott (1606–1676). Thott lost her father at only 6 years old. Her mother was a learned woman and educated her in language and literature. Being educated by learned parents was the only real way for young girls to receive any sort of education in Denmark at the time. Thott married Otto Giøe in 1632 at the age of twenty two, but he died ten years later due to illness surrounding a gunshot wound. The two did not have any children. Despite not having any biological children of her own, Birgitte Thott was responsible for fostering two children that we know of: Elisabeth and Sophie. Career Title page from Thott's translation of Seneca's works into Danish. Birgitte Thott's name is not mentioned but she is shown AS Minerva wearing a helmet at the top of the page She is most famous for her translation of moral philosopher Seneca’s Philologus in 1658 from Latin to Danish. The enormous undertaking of the Seneca translation ended up being 1,000 pages. This translation was the first of its kind, and introduced a new cultural and religious conversation to the Danish audience. The translation also introduced new words into the Danish language. Though being proficient in Latin, Birgitte Thott did not write any Latin of her own, rather, she focused on translating. \\"Contemporary sources report that she before her death mastered Danish, German, Dutch, English, French, Italian, Spanish, Latin, Greek and Hebrew, of which her knowledge of German, English, French and Latin can be confirmed through preserved translations from her hand.\\" She resumed and recommitted to her studies after her husband's death. In 1660, Birgitte Thott was given permission by the King to receive an annual grant from the Soro Academy to pursue her studies, expand her library, and research language. This was achieved with the assistance of Jørgen Rosenkrantz. Thott was part of a rather small European network of approximately 100–150 learned women including Christina Queen of Sweden, Marie le Jars du Gournay (in France), Bathsua Makin (in England) and Dorothea Moore (in Ireland), and Anna Maria van Schurman. She became a well respected woman in the Danish scholarly community, despite not having a public \\"profession\\". She was one of the first defenders of women's rights in Scandinavia. Tributes Feminist artist Judy Chicago completed an installation art piece called The Dinner Party in 1979, currently on display at the Brooklyn Museum. There are 39 place settings around a table for 39 significant mythological and historical women. The porcelain tile floor; the Heritage floor, is inscribed in gold with 999 additionally notable women. Birgitte Thott is included among these women under the name Bridget Thott. In translating Seneca, Thott praised the Romans for asserting that women, as well as men, should be honored and praised for their life accomplishments in funeral orations. In this vein, Professor Jørgen Rosenkrantz wrote Birgitte Thott a funeral address which has been preserved. It tells of her life and many achievements. Quote from Rozenkrantz’ funeral orations: > So, at thirty-one years of age, guided by eminent teachers, she embarked > upon learning the Latin language, which today is studied far and wide by > scholars, and the result was so good that she could very soon express > whatsoever thought she so wished in that language. In order to acquire the > innermost meaning of the Holy Scripture she later worked – not without yield > and exceptional progress – with the Hebrew language, which is the language > employed by God to impart His Word to the patriarchs and the prophets, and > in which the canonical writings of the Old Testament were originally > rendered. She was perfectly aware that water has one taste at its source and > another down the river. Anna Maria van Shurman wrote one of twelve introductory poems for Thott’s translation of Seneca’s Philologus in which she referred to Birgitte as the tenth muse, which was a praise-worthy term for learned women at the time.  Unpublished achievements  Birgitte Thott also wrote a personal manuscript or \\"treatise\\" of two hundred pages titled Om et lyksaligt liv (On a Happy Life). In this, she asserts that even if women are not exposed to learning other languages, they should have access to literary works from other cultures via translation. This was the driving force behind her life's work. Quotes from On a Happy Life: On young girls not being encouraged to have an education: > No one whets their appetite to the sweetness found there. No one tells them > what delicious food there is for the soul, what effective remedy against all > their frailties it is to have a little understanding of bad and good. There > are many, and this I have heard often, who would rather impress upon young > maidens that poring over books will make them objects of derision. On education for young boys: > But young male children are treated completely differently. They are enticed > into study by the reward and honour they are told they can thereby attain; > [...] they are impelled to attend school by their parents or guardians > whether they like it or not. There are so many learned men who sweat and > toil to educate and teach them [...] neither exertion nor expense is spared > at the institutions of education [...] in order to lead the students > onwards.

The work presents a nightmarish scene with fantastic creatures.Alexander Gilchrist, The Life of William Blake, General Books LLC, 2009, p.287. C. Scott Littleton, Gods, goddesses, and mythology, vol. 1, Marshall Cavendish, 2005, p. 620. The Triple Hecate is painted with deep tones and bold masses. Blake employed a new technique whose \\"effect is darker and richer than [his] illuminated books\\".Kathleen Raine, William Blake (London: Thames and Hudson 1970; reprint: Oxford University [nd]) at 85-86 (illustration no.63). Works created using the technique, involving distemper on mill-board, include: God creating Adam, Newton, Nebuchadnezzar, Ruth, Pity, The House of Death, and God judging Adam. One scholar interprets his colour print Hecate thus: > \\"She is triple, according to mythology: a girl and a boy hide their heads > behind her back. Her left hand lies on a book of magic; her left foot is > extended. She is attended by a thistle-eating ass, the mournful owl of false > wisdom, the head of a crocodile (blood-thirsty hypocrisy), and a cat-headed > bat.\\"S. Foster Damon, A Blake Dictionary. The ideas and symbols of William > Blake (Brown University 1965; reprint Shambhala, Boulder, 1979) at 391, > under the entry \\"Superstition\\". Higher-resolution reproductions show the > \\"crocodile\\" behind the rock as likely a frog or snake. Here, however, Prof. > Damon compares Blake's Hecate not to Enitharmon (the Eternal Female who as > 'Spiritual Beauty' is also the consort of Los), but rather to the Rephaim > (ghosts). Damon (1965, 1979) at 124-125, 346, 391. Blake often drew on Michelangelo to create and compose his epic images, including Hecate's, according to a consensus of critics. \\"Blake is indebted to Michelangelo for many of his giant forms\\".Jenijoy La Belle, \\"Blake's Visions and Re-Visions of Michaelangelo\\" 13-22, at 13, in Blake in his time (Indiana University 1978), edited by Robert N. Essick and Donald Pearce. Michelangelo contributed many \\"characters to Blake's gallery of mythic persons and heroes\\".Jean H. Hagstrum, William Blake. Poet and Painter (University of Chicago 1964) at 39-40. Hagstrum here includes \\"Blake's Triple Hecate, Urizen, Los, Albion, Newton\\". Regarding the Hecate colour print, a suggested trail may be traced. From Michelangelo, Blake copied his early sketch entitled The Reposing Traveller, which then evolved into a figure for his work (1795-1797) regarding Night Thoughts,Blake created 537 watercolor designs for a new issue of Edward Young's Night Thoughts (1742-45), of which only 43 were then published. In 1980 two volumes containing 728 reproductions of Blake's work here were published by Oxford University. Joseph Viscomi, \\"William Blake's Designs for Edward Young's Night Thoughts. A complete edition\\" in Fine Print (Spring 1982): 49-50. and also into the similarly posed figure of Hecate here.Cf., La Belle, \\"Blake's Visions and Re-Visions of Michelangelo\\" 13-22, at 18-20 with Plate 22 (The Reposing Traveller) & Plate 24 (figure re Night Thoughts, VII, p. 40) in Blake in his time (Indiana University 1978). The image may also allude to the Three Fates — the Moirai of Greek mythology and the Parcae of Roman. Notwithstanding these allusions, critics point out that a contemporary trigger for Blake's inspiration probably was the return popularity of Shakespeare's play Macbeth.Emory University. \\"Blake. Hecate\\". Consulted on September 25, 2010. As Hecate listens offstage,Shakespeare's Hecate describes herself as \\"the close contriver of all harms\\". Macbeth III,v. the three witches, in arranging Macbeth's doom, chant: \\"Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble\\". Each witch in turn adds her verses, the second's being: :\\"Fillet of a fenny snake, :In the cauldron boil and bake; :Eye of newt and toe of frog, :Wool of bat and tongue of dog, :Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting, :Lizard's leg and owlet's wing, :For a charm of powerful trouble, :Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.\\" (Macbeth, IV.i) Hence, bat, owl, snake or frog would be appropriate to The Triple Hecate. Blake printed his illuminated Europe a Prophecy in 1794. The bulk of the book, according to one scholar, \\"is devoted to the night of Enitharmon's joy, when she establishes her Woman's World with its false religion of chastity and vengeance: a religion of eighteen hundred years, which is the error of official Christianity.\\"S. Foster Damon, A Blake dictionary: the ideas and symbols of William Blake (Brown University 1965; Shambhala 1979; UPNE 1988) at 125. Index (1979) by Morris Eaves. In other words, it is said to represent a Feminine Will over a patriarchal Christianity.S. Foster Damon, A Blake dictionary: the ideas and symbols of William Blake (1965; 1988) at 25.Nicholas M. Williams, Ideology and utopia in the poetry of William Blake, Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 81. John Howard, Infernal poetics: poetic structures in Blake's Lambeth prophecies, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1984, p.143. Blake's character is described as \\"the Moon of love to Los's Sun\\", hence its relationship with Hecate, one of the Moon Goddesses alongside Diana/Artemis and Selene. She is also invoked in Hamlet, in the play within the play method, by the (actor) Lucianus: \\"With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected, Thy natural magic and dire property [...]\\"Shakespeare, Hamlet, III. ii. but in Europe: a Prophecy Enitharmon's night is presented in this way: :\\"Now comes the night of Enitharmon's joy! :Who shall I call? Who shall I send? :That Woman, lovely Woman! may have dominion :Arise O Rintrah thee I call! & Palamabron thee. :Go! tell the human race that Womans love is Sin! :That an Eternal life awaits the worms of sixty winters :In an allegorical abode where existence hath never come: :Forbid all Joy, & from her childhood shall the little female :Spread nets in every secret path.\\" There are other literary sources for the myth of Hecate, such as Metamorphoses by Ovid, VI 140, VII 74, 94, 174, 177, 194, 241, XIV 44, 405, and Blake himself: \\"The Gods all Serve her at her will; so great her Power is, like fabled Hecate, she doth bind them to her law.\\" (Blake, Then She bore Pale desire…). But not only in his poetry The Triple Hecate makes a connection: it is seen as an opposition to his painting Pity, circa 1795, where the piety provides a \\"possibility of salvation\\" in the fallen world.Martin Butlin, William Blake 1757-1827, Tate Gallery Collections, V, London 1990. Here, both witchcraft and curse, associated with Hecate, are factors to human perdition. Geoffrey Keynes wrote about it: The image was created in a time in which Shakespeare's Macbeth had a revival, being performed nine times.Nick Rawlinson, William Blake's comic vision, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003, p.48. Like other works by Blake, such as The Ghost of a Flea, the picture is part of W. Graham Robertson's private collection and was presented to the Tate Gallery by himself in 1939. It is considered to be one of the most brilliant and significant pictures of William Blake.Blake, Volumes 14-15. University of New Mexico. Dept. of English.

It aired on October 11, 2010. Plot A young woman (Erin Cahill) is home alone. She hears a noise, notices the front door was open and calls her husband, Billy (Zachary Knighton). She searches the house, fearing intruders. It turns out to be nothing but the wind, but when she runs into Billy arriving downstairs, she begins projectile vomiting. House (Hugh Laurie) is introduced to Kelly Benedict (Vinessa Shaw), the new fellow Chase (Jesse Spencer) hired. Not surprisingly House doesn't give her a warm reception. A few ideas are tossed around about the vomiting woman, one of which is lead poisoning. House tells Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) he and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) aren't spending the night together at her place and he isn't spending any time with Cuddy's daughter. While working on Margaret, Chase assures Kelly not to worry about the cool reception she got from House and Foreman (Omar Epps). They notice multiple broken ribs, something she never told the doctors about. At Margaret's house, Foreman denies having feelings for Thirteen (Olivia Wilde). They find a credit card receipt from a lunch Margaret never mentioned. Margaret tells the docs the lunch was an honest mistake and the fractures are a decade old. House is less than romantic the next time Cuddy leaves his place. As she leaves, an attractive blonde masseuse arrives. Doing research into her past, Kelly finds Margaret is using the social security number of a woman born in the 1940s. Meanwhile Margaret seizes with a heart attack. Margaret wakes up to House asking who she is. She tells Billy that five years ago she was married to an abusive man. She left him, but he found her, stalked her and poisoned her dog. She took a dead woman's identity to escape the man (named Carl). She tells them her real name is Jenny. House grills Kelly for answers about Jenny's dueling stomach/heart issues. She doesn't come up with anything. House suggests the ex used the poison with which he killed the dog to poison Jenny as well. Foreman isn't convinced Kelly is talented enough to work with them. He thinks Chase wants to sleep with her. Billy is upset she never told him about the abusive ex and leaves. Cuddy asks House about the masseuse. House says she is a hooker he used to get \\"happy endings\\" from. After going through 15 different massage therapists, this is the only one he likes. Cuddy says she won't see him any more unless he stops seeing the hooker/masseuse. Chase learns from Kelly she was not, in fact, the lead editor for the paper at her medical school. She asks if he regrets hiring her, but he says no. Chase gets a page that Billy has just been admitted to the ER. House tells Wilson the hooker/masseuse issue will set a principle for the entire relationship. Wilson thinks he needs to make this sacrifice to save the relationship. Billy tells the doctors he found a guy named Carl in Jenny's address book and went to see him. When Carl denied everything, Billy got upset and then got beaten up. Carl is not pressing charges, but Kelly thinks Billy should. Carl said he was just a guy Jenny used to work with. Jenny's temperature begins to spike. House shows a picture of Chase's mother on a projector and suggests the similarity in appearance to Kelly is why he hired her. Kelly mentions Legionnaires' disease. House decides they should look into it. Foreman figures out it was actually Chase who came up with the Legionnaires' disease idea and told that to Kelly during prep. In the hallway, Chase wants to know why Foreman is so upset about Kelly being unqualified. He guesses Foreman is picking on her because he's scared to take on House. House hires an attractive man named Felipe (Eddie Matos) to give Cuddy a massage. She tries to get out of it but ends up getting the massage. During the massage, she figures out he is a male prostitute. Kelly is stressed-out and tells Chase she's considering quitting. Chase counters she should lean on her background in psychiatry. Billy tells Kelly he found out that the abuse counseling center in Trenton that Jenny claimed to have visited does not exist. He's worried she could be lying about any number of things, but Kelly tells him to relax for the time being. House tells Cuddy he isn't bothered by a male prostitute giving her a massage and she should treat him the same way. She points out the difference in the situation and wonders whether this is House's way of sabotaging the relationship. House responds that she should invite him over and introduce him to her daughter. She says she wants to protect her daughter and this makes House think she's holding back. When Jenny wakes up, Billy calmly asks her about the lies. During this conversation she begins to hallucinate, seeing flames and snakes all over the room. House wakes up alone. The doctors assume whatever is happening has hit Jenny's brain. Kelly is the only one to suggest these latest symptoms could be unrelated, simply the first signs of mental illness. House orders a brain biopsy. During surgery, Jenny's temperature breaks. House talks with Kelly, Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Chase and they realize her temperature could have been gone since the day before and that she hasn't vomited since being admitted. House goes to the OR and turns off Jenny's pacemaker. Nothing happens. All that's left of her symptoms are her delusions. Kelly wonders if maybe they were prompted by the physical symptoms. House thinks it was just the opposite and orders that Jenny be treated with haloperidol and lorazepam. House talks to the still-hallucinating but calm Jenny. He goes through all of her lies (former husband, treatments, etc.) and has her admit to Billy that she has schizophrenia. On his way out of the room, House makes a crack about Kelly not being able to figure this out from the beginning. Billy goes to House and tells him he thinks it may be too hard to live with her now. \\"It's always hard,\\" House says. In the elevator, Chase tells House he should probably get rid of Kelly. House disagrees, since she was the only one to get him to the right answer. House agrees he will stop seeing his hooker/masseuse. Cuddy invites him over. Chase finds Kelly packing up her stuff to quit. She is going to leave, but Chase asks her if she is free for dinner House, Cuddy, and her daughter have dinner together. \\"Aren't you adorable,\\" he says to her when Cuddy leaves the room.

Entertainment Merchants Association, 564 U.S. 786 (2011), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court that struck down a 2005 California law banning the sale of certain violent video games to children without parental supervision. In a 7–2 decision, the Court upheld the lower court decisions and nullified the law, ruling that video games were protected speech under the First Amendment as other forms of media. The ruling was seen as a significant victory for the video game industry. Several of the Court's justices suggested that the issue might need to be re-examined in the future, considering the changing nature of video games and their continuously improving technology.  Background  Many video games, as early as 1976's Death Race, incorporate some aspect of violence into the gameplay mechanic, such as killing an enemy with a weapon, using explosives to destroy a structure, or engaging in dangerous vehicle races. With modern technology, representations of such violence have become more realistic. This has led to concerns that minors who play such video games will be influenced by the violence, altering their real-life behavior. Academic studies have attempted to find a connection between violent video games and the rate of violence and crimes from those that play them; some have stated a connection exists, while others find no link between the matters. Incidents such as the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 have heightened concerns of a potential connection between video games and violent actions. Accordingly, many concerned groups including politicians and parents have sought to enact regulatory controls of video games to prevent their sales to youth. Prior and during the Brown v. EMA case, parties like the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) sought to overturn similar state laws that placed limits on the sales of violent video games to minors in Michigan and Illinois. The ESA won these cases, with the laws being found unconstitutional and overly restrictive of protected speech. These states did not further challenge the court rulings. The ESA similarly defeated a Louisiana bill in the 2006 Entertainment Software Association v. Foti case that would have attempted to ban sales of violent video games to minors. A typical ESRB rating label will identify the appropriate age group and specific content descriptors for each rated game. To counteract these increasing complaints and attempts at legislation, the video game industry in the United States created the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in 1994. This was prompted by a 1993 congressional hearing over the violence in the video game Mortal Kombat and lack of consistent content ratings between publishers, with Congress threatening to pass legislation that would mandate a ratings system if the industry did not take its own steps. The industry reacted by forming the Interactive Digital Software Association, which would become the ESA, and establishing the ESRB. The ESRB, like the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system, is a voluntary and self-regulated body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similarly bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the rating of the game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of unrated games, so virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB. Attempts have been made to mandate the ratings system; the Family Entertainment Protection Act, a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators Hillary Clinton, Joseph Lieberman, and Evan Bayh, would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000–2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by the Federal Trade Commission found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest success rate of any media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time. Similar content rating systems exist in other countries, including the EU's Pan European Game Information (PEGI) system, the Australian Classification Board, and Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization.  California law  Former California state senator Leland Yee introduced CA Law AB 1179, the law debated in the case. In 2005, the California State Legislature passed AB 1179, sponsored by then-California State Senator Leland Yee, which banned the sale of violent video games to anyone under age 18 and required clear labeling beyond the existing ESRB rating system. The law would have a maximum $1000 fine for each infraction. The definition of \\"violent video game\\" used a variation of the Miller test, a three-pronged test used previously by the United States Supreme Court to define when obscene speech is not protected under the First Amendment. The bill was signed into law by Gov. Schwarzenegger in October 2005. The law would have gone into effect in January 2006. The law was a second attempt by Senator Yee to enact restrictions for video game sales to minors. Yee's background as a child psychologist led him to assert there was a connection between video games and violence and believed that the government had strong interest in restricting video game sales to minors as was already done for pornographic works. In 2004, Yee had drafted a law that would have required mature-rated video games to be stocked separately from other titles. Though the bill ultimately passed as CA Law AB 1793, the bill's language was diluted at its passage, only requiring stores to display the ESRB ratings system and provide information to parents about it.  Legal challenges  = The District Court opinion = Before the California bill was signed into law, the ESA and the Video Software Dealers Association (VSDA), now known as the Entertainment Merchants Association (EMA), were preparing a lawsuit to overturn the law, fearing that the \\"violent video game\\" definition would affect many titles that the ESRB has otherwise labeled appropriate for younger players, and threaten to harm the video game industry. The VSDA filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and was later joined by the ESA. The two groups succeeded in obtaining a preliminary injunction in December 2005 to block enforcement of the law during the case; U.S. District Judge Ronald M. Whyte cited in his preliminary decision: \\"The plaintiffs have shown at least that serious questions are raised concerning the States' ability to restrict minors' First Amendment rights in connection with exposure to violent video games, including the question of whether there is a causal connection between access to such games and psychological or other harm to children.\\" In August 2007, Whyte ultimately ruled for the plaintiffs, holding that the law violated the First Amendment, and that there was an insufficient showing of proof that either video games differed from other media or that there was established causality between violent video games and violent behavior. = The Ninth Circuit appeal = Then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger led the appeal of the lower courts' decisions. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appealed the ruling in September 2007, stating that he would \\"vigorously defend this law\\" and that he and the people of California have \\"a responsibility to our kids and our communities to protect against the effects of games that depict ultra-violent actions\\". The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Whyte's decision in 2009. The Ninth Circuit considered the constitutionality of the law; given the timeframe of the law's passing relative to litigation, it was referred to as the \\"Act\\" in the court's opinion. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's Summary Judgment for the VSDA by holding: #The Act is a presumptively invalid content-based restriction on speech, so it is subject to strict scrutiny and not the \\"variable obscenity\\" standard from Ginsberg v. New York.. #The Act violates rights protected by the First Amendment because the state has not demonstrated a compelling interest, has not tailored the restriction to its alleged compelling interest, and there exists a less- restrictive means that would further the State's expressed interest. #The Act's labeling requirement is unconstitutionally compelled speech under the First Amendment because it does not require the disclosure of purely factual information, but compels the carrying of the State's controversial opinion. The court first addressed the VSDA's argument that the entire Act should be invalidated based on the defendant's concession on appeal that the definition of \\"violent video game\\" in the Act is unconstitutionally broad. However, the statute had a severability clause,California Civil Code § 1746.5. so the court went through the severability test set forth in Hotel Employees & Rest. Employees Int'l Union v. Davis. The court held that the definition for \\"violent video game\\" is grammatically and functionally separable because, as an alternative definition of \\"violent video game\\", it can be removed from the Act without affecting the wording or function of the Act's other provisions. Further, the definitions are volitionally separable because those sections were not of critical importance to the passage of the Act and the legislative body would have adopted the Act had it foreseen the partial invalidation of the statute. These definition sections were only included to avoid the possibility that a court would rule the terms unconstitutionally vague; the court found that the legislature would still have enacted the statute without this definition section. The court next went on to determine what level of scrutiny should be applied in reviewing the Act's prohibitions. The defendants insisted that the \\"variable obscenity\\" standard from Ginsberg v. New York should be used. However, the court held that the \\"variable obscenity\\" standard does not apply to violence. The Court in Ginsberg was careful to place substantive limits on its holding, and concern in Ginsberg regarded only \\"sex material\\", not violence. The court declined to extend the application of the \\"variable obscenity\\" standard to violence, so strict scrutiny was applied instead. In applying the strict scrutiny standard, the court recognized that \\"content-based regulations are presumptively invalid\\",. and to survive invalidation, the Act had to fulfill two qualifications: #Restrictions \\"must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest\\". #\\"If a less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the legislature must use that alternative.\\". The court invalidated the statute on both accounts. First, the court said that in considering its decision, the court limited the purpose of the Act to the actual harm to the brain of a child playing a violent video game. As a result, the state was required to show that \\"the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way\\".. Here, the defendants failed to do so because all of the reports they relied on in making these claims were admittedly flawed. While the state is allowed to protect minors from actual psychological or neurological harm, it is not permitted to control minors' thoughts. Second, the court held that the defendants did not demonstrate the absence of less restrictive alternative means. In fact, video games already comply with a voluntary rating system that rates video games based on their topics and age appropriateness. This is a clear example of a less restrictive means. The court noted that the least restrictive means is not the same as the most effective means. The court also evaluated the constitutionality of the Act's labeling provision, which requires that a label be affixed to the front of every package the state deems to be a \\"violent video game\\". Generally, \\"freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say\\".. However, the court has upheld compelled commercial speech where it is the inclusion of \\"purely factual and uncontroversial information\\" in advertising.. However, the labeling requirement of \\"violent video game\\" is not factual information. The Act has not clearly and legally provided a way to determine if a video game is violent so the sticker does not convey factual information. Consequently, the court found that the Act is unconstitutional. = Supreme Court appeal = Justice Antonin Scalia, along with those supporting the ESA side of the case, questioned whether violent video games should be treated differently from other media with similar violence regularly exposed to minors, such as the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel. Gov. Schwarzenegger again appealed to the Supreme Court, looking to overturn the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believed that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there were unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to the acceptance of the certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt would reflect the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law. The Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA) launched an online petition along with their amicus brief to provide the Supreme Court additional information. The Progress & Freedom Foundation and the Electronic Frontier Foundation together submitted an amicus brief citing social research that declared Super Mario Bros. to be a violent video game. It was compared to Mighty Mouse and Road Runner, cartoons that depict a similar form of violence with little negative reaction from the public. Video game developers Microsoft and Activision Blizzard supported the ESA effort. Industry associations for musical works, movies, and publishing, including the National Association of Broadcasters, the Motion Picture Association of America, Recording Industry Association of America, National Cable & Telecommunications Association, and the Future of Music Coalition, also submitted briefs to the court in favor of striking down the law, fearing that should the law be found constitutional, their industries would also be affected. Associations for the protection of civil rights, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Coalition Against Censorship, and the National Youth Rights Association, submitted amicus briefs. Also filing amicus briefs against the State of California was a coalition of other states including Rhode Island, Arkansas, Georgia, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah and Washington, as well as Puerto Rico, which stated the law was unnecessary as no evidence linked video games to youth violence and the voluntary ESRB system was working well. Also submitting an amicus brief opposing the law was a coalition of 82 psychologists, criminologists, medical scientists and media researchers concerned that the State of California had misrepresented the science on video games. The State of California was joined by eleven other States, including those that had passed laws later declared unconstitutional; the States, in an amicus brief, stated that they are \\"vitally interested in protecting the welfare of children and in helping parents raise them\\" but the District Court's decision restricts their authority to do so. Further supporting the State of California were the American Academy of Pediatrics, the California Psychological Association, Common Sense Media, and the Eagle Forum. Oral arguments were held on November 2, 2010. To California's attorney, the Justices voiced concern on the distinction between video games and other commercial works such as films and comic books. Justice Antonin Scalia wondered if the law with its vague definition of \\"violence\\" could also be applied to Grimm's Fairy Tales. To the ESA and other trade groups, the Justices suggested that California and other states do have precedence to protect minors from certain forms of violence, though under narrower terms than the California law. Justice John Roberts argued that while companies can provide parental filters on such violent games, \\"any 13-year-old can bypass [them] in about five minutes\\". Several questions centered on the controversial game Postal 2, where the player can urinate on non-player characters and set them ablaze, among other violent acts. The Justices, in general, agreed that upholding California's law would require a \\"novel extension of First Amendment principles to expressions concerning violence\\". With Jerry Brown winning the 2010 California Governor election, the case was renamed to Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n after the oral hearings.  Opinion  Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the majority opinion in the case. On June 27, 2011, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 opinion striking down the California law as unconstitutional on the basis of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The majority opinion was authored by Justice Antonin Scalia and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Kennedy, Sotomayor, and Kagan. It first held that \\"video games qualify for First Amendment protection\\": Justice Scalia then affirmed that, while states may pass laws to block obscene material from minors as previously decided in the 1968 Ginsberg v. New York case, \\"speech about violence is not obscene\\", and California's statute was unlawful. The decision pointed to fairy tales like those of the Brothers Grimm, which are regularly given to children to read, \\"contain no shortage of gore\\" that are also present in video games. The decision further compared video games to classical works like The Divine Comedy, stating that \\"Even if we can see in them nothing of any possible value to society ..., they are as much entitled to the protection of free speech as the best of literature.\\" Scalia's decision also stated that the current self- moderated industry standards like the ESRB are operated effectively to regulate the sale of more mature games to minors, and that \\"filling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents' control can hardly be a compelling state interest\\" requiring a law to enforce. The Court's decision also determined that from the evidence, there was no \\"compelling\\" link between violent video games and its effects on children. The decision cited one medical report that asserted that cartoons like Looney Tunes generate the same effects in children as in games like Sonic the Hedgehog or imagery of guns. = Alito's concurrence = Justice Samuel Alito wrote a separate concurrence supporting the majority decision, and was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts. Though Alito agreed with the constitutional application to the California law, believing that its \\"threshold requirement\\" that guides what material would be covered by the law was too broad, he questioned the potential double standard that existed between violence and sexual content in regards to this threshold. Alito wrote that he was unsure that there was no connection between violent video games and effects on children, stating that \\"There are reasons to suspect that the experience of playing violent video games just might be very different from reading a book, listening to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show\\", referencing the book Infinite Reality which highlights the psychological effects of virtual reality, and argued that the decision \\"would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem\\". = Dissents = Justices Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer dissented, each writing a separate dissent. Justice Thomas, in his dissent, considered that historically, the Founding Fathers \\"believed parents to have complete authority over their minor children and expected parents to direct the development of those children\\", and that the intent of the First Amendment \\"does not include a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents or guardians\\". Breyer wrote separately, concerned that the majority's decision conflicts with previous rulings from Ginsberg and Miller. He contrasted the previous findings regulating sales of publications containing nudity to those of violent video games: \\"But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13 year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her?\\" Breyer further argued that \\"This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education\\", believing that the Government has a vested interest in allowing parents to make decisions for their child as to \\"raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work\\", and that \\"California's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression.\\" Breyer also expressed concern that the self-regulation of the industry still allowed for 20% of minors to purchase mature video games on a national average, and as high as 50% in the case of one nationwide chain, based on the aforementioned 2011 Federal Trade Commission study.  Reactions  The ruling was praised by the video game industry, which had expected the law to be ruled unconstitutional, but sought affirmation by the Court. ESA's CEO, Michael Gallagher, responded that \\"The Court declared forcefully that content-based restrictions on games are unconstitutional; and that parents, not government bureaucrats, have the right to decide what is appropriate for their children.\\" Bo Anderson of the EMA stated that \\"there now can be no argument whether video games are entitled to the same protection as books, movies, music, and other expressive entertainment\\", while Electronic Arts' (former) CEO John Riccitiello asserted that the decision \\"affirmed the constitutional rights of game developers\\". Other entertainment industries, such as the Motion Picture Association of America, also showed support for the Court's decision. Former U.S. Senator and current head of the Association Chris Dodd recognized that the motion picture industry has seen similar attempts to limit its freedom of expression, and that \\"We applaud the Supreme Court for recognizing the far- reaching First-Amendment implications posed by the California law.\\" Groups that supported the California law were critical of the decision. California State Senator Leland Yee was very critical of the decision, claiming that \\"It is simply wrong that the video game industry can be allowed to put their profit margins over the rights of parents and the well-being of children.\\" Yee stated he would review the opinions and attempt to reintroduce a new bill within the constitutionality of the decision, and claimed it was \\"disappointing the court didn't understand just how violent these games are\\". James Steyer of Common Sense Media also criticized the decision, citing that \\"If parents decide a violent game is okay for their kid, that's one thing, but millions of kids are not able to judge the impact of ultra-violence on their own.\\" Andy Schlafly, who had submitted a brief to the court on behalf of the Eagle Forum and Legal Defense Fund, heavily criticized the majority opinion, believing that \\"the court's latest disregard of parental rights is on a crash course with technological advances\\". Tim Winter of the Parents Television Council asserted that the Court's decision \\"replaces the authority of parents with the economic interests of the video game industry\\". The Washington Post opined that the California law \\"did nothing to infringe on the rights of adults\\" while dealing with \\"reasonable limitations on minors' access to extremely violent games that even the video game industry acknowledges are inappropriate\\", and that with the high bar for any future legislation, the onus is on the video game industry to maintain its self-policing of video game sales. Analysts believed that while this was a major victory for the video game industry, the challenge is not yet over. Dan Offner, a partner for the video game industry analysis firm Loeb & Loeb believed that similar laws and regulations will be sought by State and Federal governments, as \\"the regulation of mature content with respect to minors as a hot button issue for the Federal Trade Commission and the various state governments\\". Other analysts cited that as more game content becomes available online as opposed to retail channels, the focus may shift more towards \\"privacy and security\\" of children and preventing children from amassing large fees from pay-to-use gaming services, pointing to a $3 million settlement that Playdom had to pay for violating privacy of its younger users. Sean Bersell of the EMA noted that future debates over violent video games may involve public opinion in addition to new legislation, noting that \\"Retailers along with publishers and parents all have a role in keeping kids away from these games.\\" Seth Schiesel of The New York Times proposed that the Court's decision should be a challenge to the industry to show that they can mature on the decision that video games are a form of art, asking the industry: \\"Will you use it as cover to pump out schlock or will you rise to the opportunity and respectability that has been afforded you?\\" Schiesel also considered that even if games with increased interactivity and reality may make the games more dangerous, this could also make the player more aware of the potential consequences of his or her actions, even when such an action is made with the purpose to gain points/level or to kill a \\"dangerous enemy\\" in that game. In January 2012, the state of California agreed to pay the ESA $950,000 for reimbursing the ESA's legal fees during the Supreme Court trial, atop approximately $350,000 in fees from the previous trials at lower courts. The ESA stated that it will use an unspecified portion of this money to help create after-school programs in \\"underserved\\" communities in the Oakland and Sacramento areas to help teach students job skills. The total cost of defending the case is estimated around $1.8 million, including the State's own legal costs. In March 2012, Kenneth Doroshow and Paul M. Smith, the lawyers for the EMA who argued the case, were presented with the Ambassador Award by the Game Developers Choice Awards. The Ambassador Award \\"honors an individual or individuals who have helped the game industry advance to a better place, either through facilitating a better game community from within, or by reaching outside the industry to be an advocate for video games\\". In a seminar given in November 2014, Justice Elena Kagan expressed her thoughts on the decision in this case, noting that for herself, she faced a difficult decision between what she felt was right – allowing parents to decide what their children should watch and play – and what the state of the law was, and in hindsight, was still not sure if they made the right decision. She noted that she, along with four others on the court, effectively added language to the decision that would preempt any future laws that attempted to restrict game sales. Mike Gallagher, CEO of the ESA, observed in 2017 that the same moral panic that led to concerns over video games and resulting in this case were starting to appear for newer video game systems that can further blur lines between the virtual and real world, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality, and anticipates that there will be further tests of the applicability of First Amendment protection these new forms of media. = Public opinion = A national telephone poll conducted in the second quarter of 2011 by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind showed that a majority of American voters (57%) agreed that states should have the \\"right to regulate the sale of video games [that are violent] in order to protect minors; the same way states regulate tobacco, alcohol and pornography\\". On the other hand, 39% of voters agreed with the Court's majority that \\"parents should make the decision\\" about what video games they purchase for their children, and what constitutes \\"too violent\\". These voters agreed with the statement \\"states do not have the right to decide that some video games are too violent for [minors], any more than they have the right to decide what literature or fairy tales are too violent\\". The poll was conducted before the Court released its decision on June 27, 2011.Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind (June 6, 2011). \\"U.S. Public Says Regulate Violent Video Games, the Focus of Brown v.

She was the first woman parish clerk in Sweden. She was put on trial for homosexuality and for having posed as a man in 1705. Life Maria Johansdotter arrived in Stockholm from Åland with her stepfather during the Great Northern War. She later stated, that in her home parish she often dressed in trousers and performed both male and female tasks. In Stockholm, she performed tasks normally given to men on farms outside of the capital. She also became a well known musician in the capital, when she played the harp as a spelman on the taverns of Gamla stan. Although she wore trousers, she still used her female name. One evening, she was given a passport under the male name Magnus Johansson by a guest at a tavern. After this, she dressed completely in male clothing and stated to her employer that she was a hermaphrodite and would henceforth live as a man. She later moved to another part of the city's surroundings where she was unknown as a woman. Partially, this was caused by the fact that the professions open to men were better paid. As a man, she supported herself as a male farmhand and started to train as a shoe maker. She was a good singer, and was employed in Lovö as a parish clerk, thus becoming the first female parish clerk in her country. In her private life, she became entangled in a string of love affairs with maids to an extent that she was given a bad reputation for being a promiscuous man. She was eventually revealed because : \\"The maids begun to care for her too much\\". After several love affairs, she fell genuinely in love with the maid Maria Andersdotter. Andersdotter was warned by her mother that there were rumors that Johansdotter was a woman, but Andersdotter stated that she did not care and accepted Johansdotter's proposal of marriage. Johansdotter promised Andersdotter that she would reveal the truth as soon as she had completed her education as a shoe maker. Maria Johansdotter then received a letter from the vicar in a parish where she was known as a woman. The couple decided to commit suicide together, but when they were discovered by the employer of Johansdotter, Maria Johansdotter contacted the vicar and reported herself. Trial Maria Johansdotter was put on trial at Svartö in 1705. The vicar of Åkers socken, Johan Acrelius, testified that she had often been dressed as a man during her employment at Tuna manor. Johansdotter stated that it was more common on Åland for women to perform male tasks. She said she often performed both male and female tasks when she grew up and liked the male better, and that when she took a male name, she had decided to love only beautiful girls in the future. Maria Johansdotter represents a unique case among the women put on trial for having posed as men, as she freely stated that she was guilty of all charges without any display of remorse or fear for the court. She admitted that she had love affairs with her own gender, but stated that she had only danced and kissed the women for fun and that she had not harmed them, that is to say impregnated them. Maria Johansdotter was sentenced by Svea Hovrätt in 1706 to eight days prison on water and bread and Uppenbar kyrkoplikt for having dressed in male attire. To pose as the opposite sex was a serious crime who could at the time result in a death sentence in accordance to the law inspired by the Bible. Several cases are known in Sweden, and it was a known phenomenon in the public conscience. Normally it was about women serving as soldiers, but Maria Johansdotter was not unique for having posed as a man to gain access to civilian professions. In Säby in 1571, a shoe maker apprentice was discovered to be a pregnant woman, and Karin Johansdotter from Kangasala in Finland served as a male servant in 1723-1726 because the salary was better for a man. The usher Petter Cederlöf, was discovered to be a female after his death in 1780, then engaged to a woman, and Gustafva Juliana Cederström (1746-1801) became widely known for having performed several different male professions reserved for men by posing as a man. Legacy The story of Maria Johansdotter have been made into a play by the musician Anders Peev and Johan Theodorsson from the Musikteater Unna (Unna Music Theater). The play was first shown at the Stockholm Pride 2012, and has been played at the International Story Festival in Rome 2013.http://www.qx.se/gaymap/?event=20217 See also * Anna Jöransdotter * Anna Ekelöf  References  * Anna Ivarsdotter Johnsson and Leif Jonsson : Musiken i Sverige.

The episode was written by Ben Richards and directed by Alrick Riley. The episode continues the \\"Nightingale\\" story-arc, a shadow organisation bent on changing the geopolitical map. In the finale, Nightingale attempt to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, and Section D have a week to prevent it. The episode was based on actual reports of conflict between the two nations. Hermione Norris made her final appearance as Ros Myers; the producers intended to leave her fate open in order for the audience to debate whether or not she survived the hotel explosion at the end of the episode. It was viewed by under six million viewers after its original broadcast, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, particularly due to the reveal of Nightingale's plot and the cliffhanger, questioning whether or not Ros survived the hotel explosion. Background The finale continues the story-arc involving a multinational shadow organisation bent on changing the geopolitical map. Referred to as \\"Nightingale\\", actor Richard Armitage has said that \\"India, Pakistan and China feature heavily. But everyone, including Russia, America and Britain have a finger in the pie.\\" In the sixth episode it is revealed that CIA liaison and Lucas North's (Armitage) lover Sarah Caufield (Genevieve O'Reilly) is part of the organisation, and flees when Lucas confronts her. In the previous episode, Section D discover that Nightingale is manipulating Hindus and Muslims to attack each other in an attempt to further tarnish relations between India and Pakistan; Section D is able to prevent the attacks in the British, but it is later revealed that Nightingale succeeded in setting up similar attacks throughout the rest of Europe and the United States. Plot An Indian submarine is forced into port at Karachi by the Pakistan Navy. Knowing it is a Nightingale plot – Pakistani General Azim Ali is a member – Section D learn they have a week to stop a nuclear war between India and Pakistan. News of this shocks the team, particularly Tariq Masood (Shazad Latif), who has family in Lahore. Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker) discovers the name of a prominent Nightingale operative, Hans Lindemann. While Lucas North and Ros Myers work to bug Lindemann's office, Sarah Caufield returns, having been ordered by CIA Head of European Operations Russell Price (Mark Aiken), also a Nightingale member, to kill Lucas. Instead, Sarah warns him to leave the country before escaping. Ruth meets a Chinese contact, Heng (Roger Yuan), who tells her that both countries will fail the negotiations and that war is inevitable. He is shot dead by an assassin in front of her. Tariq finds Sarah staying at a hotel under an assumed name. Lucas and Ros apprehend her after Lucas distracts her and Ros shoots her in the leg. At a hospital, Sarah reveals to Lucas that Nightingale wants India and Pakistan to go to war in order to \\"contain\\" the future, where Nightingale believes the Taliban will take over Pakistan and gain control of nuclear weapons, though the war will kill several million innocent lives in the process. As Lucas leaves the room momentarily to call Ros, an assassin kills Sarah; Lucas captures him and learns that Price arranged the hit. To prevent negotiations from succeeding, Price rigs the Summit hotel with explosives. To prevent Pakistani President Mudasser (Nicholas Khan) and Home Secretary Andrew Lawrence (Tobias Menzies) from escaping, he paralyses both of them. Learning Price is in the hotel, Lucas and Ros arrive and capture him. Since disarming the bomb is impossible, Ros threatens to leave Price behind when the bomb explodes unless he divulges the room both politicians are held. Although Price eventually discloses the room number, Ros leaves him in the room where the bomb is anyway. Lucas is able to carry Mudasser safely out of the hotel, where he recovers and orders the release of the Indian submarine, preventing the war. However, Ros is still in the hotel, struggling to pull Lawrence to safety. As Lucas runs back to aid her, the hotel explodes, killing Lawrence, Price and Ros. Production =Writing and pre-production= The episode is Hermione Norris' last as Ros Myers. Before the episode aired there was speculation that Hermione Norris will leave the series following the \\"explosive finale explosive cliffhanger.\\" When questioned whether she will leave the series, Norris would not comment. In June 2010, co-star Richard Armitage confirmed that Norris has left the series, meaning the series eight finale was her final episode as Ros. The producers left the episode end with a cliffhanger to have the audience debate whether or not Ros and Lawrence survived the hotel explosion. Casting an actor as Russell Price was initially a problem for the producers, but they decided to cast Mark Aiken for the role following his work in American television. An actual news reporter was cast to record a news story. The reporter runs the dialogue with the producers at 4:30 in the morning, and then record the story before 6am, the time reporters start their work on actual news stories. The episode was written by Ben Richards. The general plot of India and Pakistan on the verge of nuclear war is based on actual reports of conflict between the two nations. The beginning was not originally in the script; Richards wanted to feature a submarine crisis, but the producers were not sure what the crisis would be. They eventually decided to have an Indian submarine \\"taken hostage\\" by the Pakistanis. They wanted to add a personal stake towards Tariq, by revealing that members of his family live in Pakistan. The intent was to include and develop a potential relationship between Ros and Lawrence to the point where they bond during their final scenes before the hotel explosion. They also wanted to touch up on the Harry/Ruth relationship, which was not in the original script; so Ben Richards added the scenes as additional dialogue. Despite the seriousness of the episode, Richards included some wit and humour. For instance, the scene where Lucas bugs Lindemann's office and \\"small talks\\" Ros; the producers wanted the scene to be different from similar scenes from movies involving secret agents planting bugs in offices and homes. The producers also wanted to have Ruth return her confidence in her work, back to how she was before her departure. The finale also includes Lucas being confused over Sarah. The writing team wanted him to despise her as a villain, but at the same time, still maintain feelings for her. Following her death, they did not want Lucas to be calm and calculating when confronting the assassin, but instead make him \\"lose it\\" and then have him broken afterward. =Filming= A scene in the pre-title sequence was filmed during the same block as episodes three and four, which were directed by Sam Miller. The rest of the finale was filmed several weeks later. The inside of a surveillance van used in a few scenes were shot at a set right next to the Grid set; using a set would be more manageable for the filming crew. A military school in Belgravia was used to film two separate locations; the Home Office and Lindemann's office. Other scenes at the Home Office were filmed in a separate building in Roehampton. The hospital Sarah was held was filmed at a new private hospital in Hammersmith that was closed down at the time. A Radisson Edwardian Hotel in the London Docklands served as the filming location for the Summit Hotel; the management of the hotel were cooperative and allowed the filming crew access to several rooms and facilities. The scene where Ruth meets Heng was filmed at Dollis Hill; it was the last scene of the episode to be shot, and was completed in one afternoon. In the fight scene between Ros and Sarah at Lindemann's office, Hermione Norris played herself, and a stunt double stood in for Genevieve O'Reilly, because her character was getting \\"thrown about a lot\\". The fight scene between Lucas and Sarah's assassin were performed by Armitage and stunt coordinator Crispin Layfield respectively. The scene where the Pakistanis take control of the Indian submarine were archival footage taken from the BBC Motion Gallery. Split screen sequences were placed towards the end more than the rest of the episode to show the audience there is a bomb at the hotel with several police officers outside the building and Lucas and Ros looking around the hotel for Lawrence and Mudasser. The sequence where the hotel exploded was made through the medium of visual effects, produced by Darkside Animation. Broadcast and reception The episode originally aired on BBC One at 9pm on 23 December 2009, and later repeated on BBC Three at 12:45am on 24 December. After its original broadcast, the series finale drew 5.5 million viewers, earning the series a 23% audience share during its time slot. It won the time slot against BBC Two's Grumpy Guide to Christmas, ITV1's Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, and Channel 4's The Family. According to the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board, the episode received final viewing figures of 5.91 million, placing Spooks the 25th most seen programme on BBC One, and the 36th most seen programme overall during the week it aired. Reviews of the episode were very positive. In a preview for the episode, Vicky Power of The Daily Telegraph said that \\"as usual there's a large body count and fist-fights, but these are tempered by scenes of high emotion\\", and if the episode were Ros' last, \\"it is a fitting send-off\\". David Chater of The Times was positive towards the episode, stating \\"just in case you think you're having an exhausting time in the run-up to Christmas, spare a thought for Lucas North [who found out] his lover is a liar, a murderer and a traitor\\", and also noted that \\"the great thing about Spooks is that they will always stop and explain how serious things are\\". The Guardian published two separate reviews for the episode. Sam Wollaston started by saying \\"they never listen\\", noting the \\"prisoner either disappears or is killed\\" and that Section D \\"need to rethink the whole prisoner thing, or hire less rubbish guards\\"; however, Wollaston also noted that since it was Sarah who was killed, \\"mo one's really going to miss snaky Sarah much\\". Plot-wise, Wollaston liked the phrase \\"getting pretty Finding Nemo about it\\", and said that Ros \\"better had\\" survived the cliffhanger, claiming \\"Spooks without Ros would be like Christmas without presents\\". Vicky Frost called the episode a \\"cracking finale\\", stating that after \\"weeks of build-up, it feels almost a relief to have the Nightingale plot finally revealed\\". In regards to the cliffhanger, Frost commented that Spooks has \\"passed its peak but not sunk so low as to be embarrassing, it still goes out on something of a high, and it's remembered as a decent example of its type\\". She was also receptive of Norris' portrayal as Ros in her likely final appearance, but felt the Harry and Ruth relationship was \\"wolly\\".

Pike; 1 October 1877 – 17 October 1963) was a British naturalist, wildlife photographer, author and early nature documentary pioneer, specialising in the study of bird life. \\"His claim to significance,\\" according to Bryony Dixon of BFI Screenonline, \\"lies in the groundbreaking techniques he developed to capture animals in their natural habitats and in the fact that he passed this knowledge on.\\"  Biography  Pike studied at Enfield Grammar School until 1893, where he became friends with local commercial photographer and ornithologist Reginald Badham Lodge, who specialised in bird photography. Pike accompanied Lodge while he worked, taking his first photograph of a wild flower at the age of 13, in the autumn of 1890. In 1895 the two invented a bird-activated trip-wire releases, which effectively allowed birds to take their own pictures. Pike developed a profound knowledge of photographic techniques and went on to publish a series of 25 handbooks on ornithological photography and cinematography, starting with In Birdland with Field Glass and Camera (1900). He also developed his own stills camera, marketed as The Birdland Camera by Sanders & Crowhurst of Shaftesbury Avenue, London, and later a cine-camera for wildlife photography that was camouflaged so as not to frighten off the subjects. A local man (bottom left -blurry) climb's Hateley Shute on Flamborough Head in around 1908 Pike's first film, In Birdland, which premiered at the Palace Theatre, London in August 1907, was the first British wildlife film to be screened to a fee paying audience. Together with cinematographer Harold Armytage Sanders, Pike took great physical risks hanging from ropes over coastal cliffs to capture unprecedented footage of Britain's seabirds, including kittiwakes, gannets, cormorants and puffins. The film proved hugely popular in its 6-week run with over 100 additional prints were made for screenings across the UK. All copies are now however believed lost or destroyed. He made two more films along a similar theme, St Kilda, Its People and Birds (1908) and Cliff Climbing – The Egg Harvest of Flamborough Head (1908), before becoming director of photography for Pathé Frères from 1910 to 1920, where he made Glimpses of Bird Life (1910), noted for its use of positioning which was \\"years ahead of their time\\" and \\"helped to establish British wildlife photographers as leaders in this field.\\" In 1921, Pike went to work for old friend Harry Bruce Wolfe at British Instructional Films on the single-reel series Secrets of Nature series. His inaugural film for the series was The Cuckoo's Secret (1922), commissioned by Edgar Chance, which changed public perception of how common cuckoos reproduce by providing the first proof that they lay their eggs directly in the nests of the species they parasitise rather than laying them on the ground and carrying them to the nest. Over the course of the next 11 years, Smith blended \\"nature photography with painstaking laboratory work,\\" on the series, \\"providing an atmospheric account of British wildlife,\\" which filmmaker, historian and critic Paul Rotha described in 1930 as \\"the sheet anchor of the British film industry.\\" He later went on to work for Gaumont-British Instructional Films on the similar Secrets of Life series, where he made the controversial A Family of Great Tits (1934), highlighting the brutality of nature with footage from a specially constructed nesting box. Working until 1947, he made over 50 films many of which showed animal behaviour that had never before been recorded. Pike, represented by the Thomas's Lecture Agency of Strand, London, was a popular speaker on wildlife subjects and lectured all over the United Kingdom. He was opposed to the egg collecting, shooting and other blood sports. He joined the Royal Photographic Society in 1907 and gained his Fellowship the same year. He was made an Honorary Fellow in 1957. He exhibited and lectured extensively at the Society.Information provided by Dr Michael Pritchard, Chief Executive of The Royal Photographic Society Some 300 prints, negatives and lantern-slides of his work, which were acquired from the London Natural History Society in 1974, are preserved in the RPS Collection at the National Media Museum in Bradford, along with one of his early cameras. He also donated several of his films to the BFI National Archive. He died in Leighton Buzzard in 1963. Memorial A local blue plaque for Oliver Pike, co-sponsored by Southgate District Civic Trust and Enfield Grammar School was unveiled on 16 November 2014 by his grandsons Jonathan and Richard Dollimore at 96 Green Dragon Lane, Winchmore Hill, his family home from 1882 to 1914.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic during the war. She was named for Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. She was the first to carry her name, was the second. Cape Breton was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942-43 River-class building program. She was laid down 5 May 1942 by Morton Engineering and Dry Dock Company in Quebec City, Quebec and launched on 24 November later that year. Cape Breton was commissioned into the RCN on 25 October 1943 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named after towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history After her commissioning, Cape Breton worked up in St. Margaret's Bay before being assigned to Escort Group 9 in 1944 based out of Derry. She operated out of several ports throughout England and in April 1944, sailed to North Russia returning with a convoy. Cape Breton participated in Operation Neptune, the naval part of the Normandy landings in June 1944. Cape Breton returned to Canada late in 1944 where she underwent a major refit at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. This took until April 1945, after which she was sent to Bermuda to work up. She returned to EG 9 upon her reactivation, escorting her final convoy in May 1945 before making her way to Vancouver for a tropicalization refit. The refit, begun on 26 June, was cancelled before completion and Cape Breton was paid off 26 January 1946 and laid up at Esquimalt, British Columbia. She was sold in 1947 to Capital Iron & Metals Ltd., Victoria, British Columbia and her hull was expended as a breakwater at Kelsey Bay, British Columbia in 1948.

Whelan is a retired Justice of the Supreme Court of New York 8th Judicial District as well as the former Comptroller of Buffalo, New York from 1976-1989. Early life Whelan was born in Buffalo, New York and was the seventh of ten children. His father, Robert J. Whelan, was a Buffalo policeman who attained the rank of Assistant Chief of Detectives. His mother, Margaret Whelan (née Southard), was a stay-at-home mother who raised ten children. His great-grandfather, James Whelan, who came from Ireland, was a Buffalo attorney who worked in the same law firm as Grover Cleveland. Whelan attended Canisius College for his Bachelor's degree, graduating with honors, before he attended the University of Buffalo for his Juris Doctorate. Public life and career Whelan, at 32, was the youngest ever elected as Buffalo's Chief Fiscal officer, where he served for an unprecedented four terms; something no one before or since has done. During Whelan's four terms in office as Comptroller, he led the efforts and oversaw their storing of Buffalo's fiscal integrity after inheriting a $35 million deficit that caused the city to lose its credit rating. He restored and improved the city's credit rating, and achieved fourteen consecutive years of city financial results ending in the black. He also introduced innovative financial and data processing mechanisms in the early 1980s. He was the first to secure negotiated bond legislation from the governor and state legislature; the first in the nation to do so. The Buffalo Water Authority's financing technique was made a reality due to his efforts. During his tenure, he negotiated and sold close to $1 billion in the city of Buffalo's long and short term borrowing. Whelan successfully achieved bond sales for the Buffalo Sewer Authority in excess of $300 million. Tim Russert One of many of Whelan's career successes was of his former \\"protege\\", NBC's Meet the Press, Tim Russert. Whelan befriended Russert when the Buffalo native had just returned to Buffalo in 1972 after he graduated from John Carroll University. At Whelan's initiative, Russert was hired in the office, of then, City Comptroller; George D. O'Connell. During Russert's law school years, Whelan secured summer employment for him. In 1977, Russert was hired as the first Buffalo Office Manager for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan at Whelan's recommendation. As Western New York's coordinator of Moynihan's first campaign, Whelan saw to it that Russert was closely involved in the inner-workings of the campaign. From there Russert moved on his own to his successes with Governor Mario Cuomo, NBC News, and later as host of NBC's \\"Meet the Press\\". They remained close friends until Russert's death in 2008.

Since 1992 he has taught at Yale University, where he is currently a professor of Film and Media Studies as well as American Studies and Theater Studies. His research has focused on such topics as Edwin S. Porter and early cinema, Oscar Micheaux and race cinema of the silent era, Paul Robeson and film performance as well as a variety of issues and individuals in documentary. His films include An American Potter (1976), Before the Nickelodeon: The Early Cinema of Edwin S. Porter (1982) and Errol Morris: A Lightning Sketch (2014). Early life and education Musser was born in Stamford, Connecticut and grew up in Old Greenwich and Riverside. The son of Robert John Musser, who worked for Union Carbide, and his wife the former Marilyn Keach, he has two sisters, Nancy Musser (Sutton) and Jane Musser (Nelson). His grandfather, John Musser, was chair of the History Department and later Dean of Graduate School at NYU. Musser attended St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, where he took Public Affairs courses with Gerry Studds. He also apprenticed to local studio potter Gerry Williams, a former conscientious objector whose father was close friends with Gandhi. Studds and Williams did much to shape his political consciousness in the late 1960s. He won the school's history prize his senior year. In the fall of 1969, he became a Yale freshman as its undergraduate college admitted women for the first time. He created his own major in film studies and, took classes with Jay Leyda, Standish Lawder, Murray Lerner, David Milch, Michael Roemer and Peter Demetz. His wrote his first film paper on Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera and his senior thesis was entitled \\"Russian Formalism and Early Soviet Film Theory\\". Musser left Yale in 1972, moving to New York City to work in the film industry. After a series of short jobs, he was hired to work on Hearts and Minds in September 1972 and eventually became the first assistant editor. In New York he worked with and learned from producer/director Peter Davis, Richard Pierce and Tom Cohen then followed the film to Los Angeles and assisted editors Lynzee Klingman and Susan Morse. He subsequently graduated from Yale in 1975. While a part-time graduate student, receiving his MA in Cinema Studies from NYU in 1979 and his Ph.D. in Fall 1986, Musser continued to work in the film industry: as a film editor on projects such as the television series Between the Wars (1978) and Mikhail Bogin's price-winning short A Private Life (1980) and as a researcher on such films as Milos Forman's Ragtime (1981) and Woody Allen's Zelig (1983). Early Films Musser received a bi-centennial grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to make An American Potter (1976), on New Hampshire studio potter Gerry Williams. Although pottery is generally considered a traditional art–-and often a craft, Williams is shown to be not only a master of traditional techniques such as Chinese reds but an innovator who invented and developed the processes of “wet firing” and “photo resist” glazing. The documentary, an admiring portrait of his mentor, was awarded a Blue Ribbon in the Arts category from the American Film Festival, \\"Best in Category-Fine Arts\\" from the San Francisco Film Festival, as well as a CINE \\"Golden Eagle.\\" Musser became interested in the origins of editing. From his research he soon realized that film editing was not \\"invented\\" but rather editing (the juxtaposition of one shot or scene to the next) and \\"post-production\\" were the domain of the exhibitor in the 1890s and were only centralized inside the production company in the early 1900s. Edwin S. Porter, an exhibitor who moved into production and became America's first \\"filmmaker,\\" embodied this shift. Receiving the Society for Cinema Studies Student Award for Scholarly Writing for his essay \\"The Early Cinema of Edwin S. Porter,\\" Musser soon garnered a New York State Council of the Arts grant to make the documentary Before the Nickelodeon: The Early Cinema of Edwin S. Porter (1982), which had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival. Carrie Rickey of the Village Voice called it one of the year's best documentaries. It was subsequently shown at the London, Berlin, Sydney and Melbourne film festivals. Musser had less success getting grants for subsequent projects but continued to work as a film editor and researcher to make a living while pursuing research and writing. Books Musser published a trilogy of books on pre-1920 American cinema over an eight-month period in 1990-91, indexing them back to back. Previously Musser had published a variety of articles that challenged much of the revisionist historiography around “early cinema.” Such disagreements were generally relegated to the footnotes. The first to be published was The Emergence of Cinema: The American Screen to 1907 (1990), the first of the trilogy to be published, garnered the Jay Leyda Prize from Anthology Film Archives (now suspended), the Theatre Library Association Award (now the Wall Award) from the Theatre Library Association, and the Katherine Kovacs Book Award in Cinema and Media Studies. Its opening chapter expanded on an earlier, influential essay that proposed looking at the early years of cinema within the framework of “screen practice.” The book provides a broad overview of American cinema into the nickelodeon era, emphasizing both the diversity of cinematic expression and the rapid and ongoing transformations in the modes of production and representation. It details the ways in which key aspects of post-production that had been in the domain of the exhibitor (specifically the juxtaposition of shots or short scenes, which we now recognize as film editing) shifted to the production company between roughly 1899 and 1903, allowing for a new centralization of creative control and the formation of what we would recognize today as the filmmaker. Musser also detailed the legal battles and other factors that led to serious disruptions of the American industry and produced what is sometimes referred to as “the chaser period” in 1901-03. Revival came with the industry’s dramatic shift from featuring news films and other forms of nonfiction to longer story films in the course of 1903, coinciding with the introduction of the three-blade shutter that reduced flicker and created a much more pleasurable viewing experience. Musser demonstrated that the rise of the story film preceded and made possible the rapid proliferation of specialized motion picture theaters popularly known as nickelodeons, in contrast to those such as Robert C. Allen who relied on cherry picked data and argued that the rise of fiction films was a calculated response to the nickelodeon boom by film producers. Before the Nickelodeon: Edwin S. Porter and the Edison Manufacturing Company was a revision of Musser’s dissertation and the first of the trilogy to be completed but the second to be published due to the introduction of new publication methods involving digital technology. It is also the companion to his documentary Before the Nickelodeon and lists the 18 complete Edison films (many only a single shot in length) and sources for the various quotes that are heard on the sound track. The book is a double portrait of Edwin Stanton Porter, America’s first important filmmaker, and Thomas Edison’s motion picture business from the inventor’s early experiments through his selling of the business 30 years later in 1918. Musser sees Porter as a representative of the fading old middle class 1) in his methods of filmmaking (his consistent use of partnerships with experienced men of the theater such as George F. Fleming, J. Searle Dawley, and Hugh Ford); 2) his system of representation (the alinear temporal structures of his films which often depended on simple, easy to follow stories; well-known stories familiar to his presumed audience, or a live commentator or lecturer to explain what might otherwise be unclear; and 3) the ideology of his films, which mixed progressive even radical elements with more conservative ones. In many respects Harry Braverman's various insights in Labor and Monopoly Capital; The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century (1974) shaped the intellectual framework of the book. NHdocs In 2014, Musser co-founded The New Haven Documentary Film Festival, which he co-directs with film director Gorman Bechard. The festival expanded from one day screening four films in 2014 to three days and over 20 films in 2015, to over 80 films spread out over 11 days and numerous venues the following year. The festival has just celebrated its 5th year.

Factual background and procedural history The plaintiff,Actually, there were two plaintiffs: Kim Nowatske and his wife Julie. In the state supreme court opinion, only Kim Nowatske, the patient, is referred to as the \\"plaintiff.\\" Kim Nowatske underwent retinal reattachment surgery in his right eye in 1989.Nowatske v. Osterloh, 198 Wis.2d 419, 426, 543 N.W.2d 265 (Wis. 1996); Nowatske v. Osterloh, 201 Wis.2d 497, 502, 549 N.W.2d 256 (Wis. App. 1996) After the surgery, Nowatske could not see out of the eye in question. During routine post-operative testing, defendant surgeon used his finger (instead of a tonometer) to measure the pressure inside Nowatske's eye and, noting a normal \\"back-off\\" response to light, did not specifically ask the patient whether he could see in his right eye or not.Nowatske v. Osterloh, 198 Wis.2d 419, 426, 543 N.W.2d 265 (Wis. 1996) The patient thought the inability to see was a normal consequence of the surgery. After the patient was discharged, he experienced severe pain; the surgeon, learning that the patient did not receive the pain medication prescribed, called in a prescription to a local pharmacy without inquiring further of the patient regarding the pain. The next day, Nowatske was examined by the surgeon and learned that the blindness in the right eye was permanent. In 1991, he and his wife sued the surgeon, and the case went to trial. A jury determined that the surgeon was not negligent,Nowatske v. Osterloh, 201 Wis.2d 497, 501; 549 N.W.2d 256 (Wis. App. 1996) and the plaintiff appealed. Issues on appeal On appeal, the plaintiff argued: * that the pattern jury instructions regarding the law of medical malpractice were erroneous, * that the trial court erroneously allowed the defense attorney to ask improper questions to impeach the plaintiff's expert during cross-examination, * that the trial court erred in allowing the defendant to point an ophthalmoscope at members of the jury during his testimony in his own defense, and * that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. Results The Wisconsin Court of Appeals certified the first three legal questions to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The state supreme court agreed to consider only the question of whether the pattern jury instructions were correct or not, and held that the jury instructions contained no legal error but \\"should be improved.\\"198 Wis.2d at 426. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals then determined that the questions asked during impeachment were improper, but that this was harmless error. Allowing the defendant to demonstrate the use of an ophthalmoscope in the courtroom was within the trial court's discretion, and although the appeals court did \\"not approve of the involvement of jurors in such a demonstration,\\"201 Wis.2d at 508 this had no effect on the outcome of the case and therefore was not reversible error. Finally, the court of appeals held that \\"[w]e will sustain a jury verdict if there is any credible evidence to support it. See Nieuwendorp v. American Family Ins. Co., 191 Wis. 2d 462, 472, 529 N.W.2d 594, 598 (1995). Our consideration of the evidence must be done in the light most favorable to the verdict, and when more than one inference may be drawn from the evidence, we are bound to accept the inference drawn by the jury . . . .

Some species are cryptic or subterranean foragers, while others forage in open grassland terrain. The workers forage singly or in groups of 2 to 3. They nest in the earth at varying depths, or in collapsed logs. They prey mainly on millipedes, including their young or eggs. Colony structure A colony of P. lygaria (a small species of the mandibularis-group) may number in excess of 300 adults. An excavated colony in the Ivory Coast consisted of 277 workers, 8 alate queens, and 42 alate males. Consequently 15% of their number was allocated to reproductives at the specific time. The colony size of P. mandibularis however, seldom exceeds 50 individuals. Nests In a colony of P. lygaria, the nest chambers are located at shallow depth, in moist soil under dense leaf litter. The deepest chamber may be located about 7 cm below the surface, with each chamber up to 1 cm in height. The chambers are specialized to house either brood or prey items. Nests of the widespread species P. mandibularis however, are composed of chambers typically located 2 feet or more below the surface, with entrances that are usually marked by large piles of earth. Diet It is believed that millipede eggs may at times constitute the exclusive diet of P. lygaria, while newly emerged millipede young may be an additional food source for the smaller Plectroctena species.

The facility will replace the aging Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) facility. It is located in Technical Area 55 (TA-55) and consists of two buildings: the Nuclear Facility (CMRR-NF) and the Radiological Laboratory, Utility, and Office Building (RLUOB). The two buildings will be linked by tunnels and will connect to LANL's existing 30-year-old plutonium facility PF-4. The facility is controversial both because of spiraling costs and because critics argue it will allow for expanded production of plutonium 'pits' and therefore could be used to manufacture new nuclear weapons. Background The CMR c. 1952 Construction of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building began in 1949 and was completed in 1952. The building contained six wings and in 1959 a seventh laboratory wing was added. In 1960, Los Alamos built Wing 9, a addition containing hot cells with remote handling capabilities. In total, the CMR building now contains roughly of laboratories and related facilities. According to Los Alamos officials, \\"many of the CMR facility systems and structural components are aged, outmoded, eroding, and generally deteriorating.\\" In 1999, the NNSA decided to plan for the \\"end-of-life\\" of the CMR building around 2010. Thereafter planning began for the CMRR facility which would serve as a replacement. There is evidence the need for an upgrade is real, since in 2010 federal safety auditors reported the building was \\"seismically fragile and poses a continuing risk to workers and the public.\\" Ground was broken on the CMRR project on January 12, 2006. Construction of the CMRR is proceeding in three phases. The first phase is the construction of the Radiological Laboratory Utility Office Building, which is expected to be finished around 2011. It has an estimated cost of $164 million and will house \\"a radiological laboratory, a training center, two simulation labs, and cleared and uncleared office space for some 350 Lab personnel\\". The second phase is the Special Equipment Facility (SPF) and the third phase is the Nuclear Facility (NF). The initial cost of the CMRR project was approved at $745–$975 Million. The total projected cost in 2008 was reported at $2 billion. In 2010, the total cost of the project was still not finalized but was estimated between $4 and $5 Billion. There is a $4 billion placeholder in the Obama administration's Fiscal Year 2011 budget for the CMRR. In 2010, a top lab manager suggested that the final price tag probably will not be known until 2014. The expected completion date is also unknown but it has been reported the project may not be completed until 2022. CMRR-NF The Nuclear Facility portion was expected to be completed around 2014 but has been delayed. It is a very complex building, featuring NNSA Security Category 1 laboratory space and a total of approximately 306 enclosures, 26 fume hoods and 43 sections of Material Transfer System (MTS). The Nuclear Facility will contain a 6-metric ton vault that will approximately triple LANL's plutonium storage capacity. There have been several difficulties in design including earthquake concerns and fail-safe issues regarding plutonium vault design. In particular, security worries called for the facility to be largely underground, but this led to increased seismic worries, which pushed the excavation requirements from to and increased the amount of concrete in the foundation to 225,000 cubic yards. Controversy Critics argue that the CMRR project is a violation, or has the potential to be a violation, of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty between the US, China, Russia, Britain and France. Critics also argue that the new facility is unnecessary for maintaining the nuclear stockpile and may be seen as a threatening development because it allows for the production of new types of nuclear weapons. Critics also cite the spiraling costs (mentioned earlier) as a major problem. Greg Mello, the director of the Los Alamos Study Group (LASG), \\"The dramatic cost escalation at CMRR-NF together with the problem of bringing other facilities into compliance with seismic safety requirements has unquantified cost implications and unknown feasibility.\\" The original cost of the CMRR-NF was estimated at $400 million in 2003 and has grown to a current estimate of $3.7 - $5.8 billion. Detractors also argue against the un-justified capabilities to produce new plutonium pits, which constitute the core and active component of nuclear weapons. LANL currently has the capacity to produce 10 to 20 pits a year, but this is expected to come to an end with the shut down of the CMR in 2010. The CMRR will expand this capability, but it is not known by how much. An Institute for Defense Analyses report written before 2008 estimated a “future pit production requirement of 125 per year, with a surge capability of 200.\\" The need for pit production is a complex issue, with the government and the military arguing that refurbishment and replacement capabilities are needed. The aging time of pits before refurbishment is needed is still being studied but some believe it is likely around 100 years or more. The U.S. has about 23,000 pits, of which about 10,000 are in weapons and roughly 15,000 are in storage at the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas. Several protests were held, including a 10-day summer camp in August 2010 called \\"Disarmament Summer Encampment\\" held in Los Alamos and organized by the nuclear abolition group Think Outside the Bomb. See also February 28, 2010 CMRR protest pictures here A non-violent civil disobedience style protest on August 6, 2010 resulted in eight arrests. On August 16, 2010, the Los Alamos Study Group filed a lawsuit against the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) which states that the original environmental impact statement (EIS) completed in 2003, with a record of decision (ROD) in 2004, is not a legitimate EIS for the current design and is a direct violation of the NEPA. The lawsuit states that the current CMRR-NF project needs to be halted until a new EIS is studied, accessing the need for this facility and its purpose and studying thoroughly all alternatives, including other locations, upgrading existing facilities, or canceling the project all together. NNSA decided to complete a new \\"Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement\\" on the project, but LASG refused to drop the suit.

LANL officials were considering using the 400,000 cubic yards of excavated volcanic ash from construction to cap two old waste disposal sites that contain 14 million cubic feet of nuclear and chemical residues. The lawsuit claimed this was a violation of the National Environmental Policy Act and noted \\"The decision to leave 14 million cubic feet of nuclear and chemical waste in shallow unlined disposal pits covered by this material would be a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, with far-reaching impacts.\\" References External links *CMRR information page *Editorials regarding the CMRR Los Alamos National Laboratory Nuclear weapons infrastructure of the United States Nuclear stockpile stewardship ","title":"Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Facility"},{"id":"28951540","text":"Sagaing Township is a township in Sagaing District in the Sagaing Division of Myanmar.

According to James George Scott's 1901 Gazetteer of Upper Burma and the Shan States, the Hkamti area was ruled by seven \\"Sawbwas\\" before the British arrived. Hkamti was bordered to the east and the south by Uyu Township and to the west by Chin country bordering Assam and covered an area of 2576 square miles. In the 1900s the British established a small rubber plantation with hevea trees at Mepok. It didn't prove to be successful. In 1914 the British built Fort Hertz in the territory of what was then Hkamti Long. Captain Frank Kingdon-Ward visited it on his travels.In Farthest Burma, Nature, volume 107, pp: 231–232 (1921) Hkamti later became the headquarters of the Myanmar Hills for the 52nd Myanmar Regiment who were controlling the area.

She operates at the intersection of creation and documentation, often taking for a point of departure, texts, poetry, archival and autobiographical documents. Her practice is built upon a long-standing exploration of the voice, sung or spoken, and its manipulation through digital technology, as a compositional method. Her largest project to date, Hepworth Resounds (2020), is a multipartite sound art project based on British sculptor Barbara Hepworth. Hepworth Resounds consists in two sound objects: The Sculptor Speaks, a resounding of a 1961 recording of Barbara Hepworth's voice, premiered on Resonance Extra and SculptOr, an album release based on Hepworth's extensive writings. Previously, Louvel explored the reigns of Mary Queen of Scots and Elizabeth I with the multimedia suite Data Regina (2017), delivering her own singular transposition through an interactive digital platform http://www.dataregina.com and a cd publication. In November 2018, she toured throughout the UK presenting a headline audio-visual set of Data Regina for ‘Synth Remix’, an event curated by Benjamin Tassie under Sound and Music's Composer-Curator scheme, also featuring Jo Thomas. Louvel has opened for artists such as Eartheater at De La Warr Pavilion, Japanese avant- garde artist Phew (singer) Planningtorock at the Earsthetic Festival Brighton Dome, and Recoil for various concerts on the European 'Selected' tour (2010).

The Orange Riots took place in Manhattan, New York City, in 1870 and 1871, and they involved violent conflict between Ulster Scots Protestants, called \\"Orangemen\\", and Irish Catholics, along with the New York City Police Department and the New York State National Guard. The riot caused the deaths of over 60 civilians -- mostly Irish laborers -- and three Guardsmen. Background On July 12, 1870, a parade was held in Manhattan by Ulster Scots Protestants celebrating the victory at the Battle of the Boyne of William III, the King of England and Prince of Orange, over James II. The parade route was up Eighth Avenue to Elm ParkThe grounds of the Apthorpe Mansion, see \\"The Lost 1764 Apthorpe Mansion\\" at 92nd Street. The participants taunted Irish Catholic residents of Hell's Kitchen and others, many of whom followed the parade and returned the harassment. At the park, the crowd of 200 hecklers was joined by a group of 300 Irish Catholic laborers working in the neighborhood, and together they attacked the Protestants. Although the police intervened to quell the fighting, 8 people died as a result of the riot.Burrows & Wallace, pp.1003-1008Gilmore, p.866 The following year, the Loyal Order of Orange requested police permission to march again. Fearing another violent incident, the parade was banned by City Police Commissioner James J. Kelso, with the support of William M. Tweed, the head of Tammany Hall, the Democratic Party political machine which controlled the city and the state. Catholic Archbishop John McCloskey applauded the decision. Protestants objected, as did newspaper editorials in the Herald and Times, a petition signed by Wall Street businessmen, and a cartoon by Thomas Nast in Harper's. Not only was the ban felt to be giving in to the bad behavior of a Catholic mob, but fears were voiced about the growing political power of Irish Catholics, the increasing visibility of Irish nationalism in the city, and the possibility of a radical political action such as occurred in Paris with the Commune. The pressure generated by these concerns among the city's elite, on top of pressure from good-government reformers against Tweed's regime in general, caused Tammany to reverse course and allow the march; Tammany needed to show that it could control the immigrant Irish population which formed a major part of its electoral power. Governor John T. Hoffman, a Tammany man, rescinded the police commissioner's ban and ordered that the paraders be protected by the city police and the state militia, including cavalry. 1871 riot On 12 July 1871, the parade proceeded with protection from 1,500 policemen and 5 regiments of the National Guard, about 5,000 men. It was to begin at the Orangemen's headquarters at Lamartine Hall, located at Eighth Avenue and 29th Street.\\"Eighth Avenue Songline\\" By 1:30 pm, the streets from 21st to 33rd were full of people, mostly Catholic, and mostly laborers, and both sides of the avenue were jammed. The police and militia arrived, to the disapproval of the crowd. The small contingent of Orangemen began their parade down the avenue at 2:00 pm, surrounded by regimental units. Lamartine Hall, at the corner of Eighth Avenue and 29th Street, on the day of the riot. The crowd began to pelt the paraders with stones, bricks, bottles, and shoes. Militiamen responded with musket fire, which brought pistol fire from some in the crowd. The police managed to get the parade moving again by charging the crowd and liberally using their clubs. The parade progressed another block but came under fire from thrown missiles again, once again provoking militia shots. The crush of the crowds prevented more forward motion, and police used their clubs and the militia used their bayonets. Rocks and crockery pelted down on them from the rooftops along the avenue. Troops starting firing volleys into the crowd, without being ordered to do so, and the police followed up with mounted charges. The parade managed to get to 23rd Street, where it turned left and proceeded to Fifth Avenue, where the crowds were supportive of the Orangemen. This changed again when the parade continued south down Fifth and reached the entertainment district below 14th Street, where the crowds were once again hostile. The parade then continued across town to Cooper Union, where the paraders dispersed. The riot caused the deaths of over 60 civilians -- mostly Ulster Scots Protestant and Irish Catholic laborers -- and three Guardsmen. Over 150 people were wounded, including 22 militiamen, around 20 policemen injured by thrown missiles, and 4 who were shot, but not fatally. About 100 people were arrested. The following day on 13 July, 20,000 mourners paid their respects to the dead outside the morgue at Bellevue Hospital, and funeral processions made their way to Calvary Cemetery in Queens by way of ferries. Governor Hoffman was hanged in effigy by Irish Catholics in Brooklyn, and the events began to be referred to as the \\"Slaughter on Eighth Avenue.\\" Effects Despite their attempt to protect their political power by allowing the parade to go forward, Tammany Hall did not benefit from the outcome, instead coming under increased criticism from newspapers and the city's elite. Tweed fell from power shortly afterwards. > One of the reasons many in the upper and middle classes had grudingly > acquiesced in Tammany's hold on power was its presumed ability to maintain > political stability.

Međeđa is located in the Međeđa gorge, which is for the most part flooded by the water reservoir, created for the Višegrad hydroelectric power plant. The Bosnian Eastern Railway from Sarajevo to Uvac and Vardište was built through Međeđa during the Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Construction of the line started in 1903. It was completed in 1906, using the track gauge. With the cost of 75 million gold crowns, which approximately translates to 450 thousand gold crowns per kilometer, it was one of the most expensive railways in the world built by that time. The railway station in Međeđa operated as a junction railway station to destinations of Sarajevo, Uvac and Vardište. The extensions were built from Uvac to Priboj, and from Vardište to Belgrade in 1928. The line was closed down in 1978, and dismantled afterwards.

She subsequently gained extensive experience in the charity world, as a director of the Ruben and Elisabeth Rausing Trust. She is currently the Co-Founder of Equileap, an Organization promoting gender equality in the workplace. Career Her career in journalism began at the Esher News and Mail in Surrey where she worked as a general reporter. After joining the BBC as a trainee journalist, she worked for BBC radio, before later moving to Independent Radio News. She joined ITN in 1985, where she initially worked as a general reporter before becoming a political correspondent for the network in 1990. She left ITN in 1993, moving to New Zealand where she established a news agency, but returned to ITN again in 1997. She was appointed as senior political correspondent in 1999, and was the first woman to join press conferences held by the Labour Party during the run-up to the 2001 general election. Later in 2001 she also interviewed then British Prime Minister Tony Blair in Brussels in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. In September 2002 Andrews announced that she would be leaving ITN to become a director of the Rausing Trust, a charitable trust that donates money to groups including human rights organisations and women's groups. Her decision to leave the broadcaster came shortly after that of its Political Editor, John Sergeant. Andrews did not comment on her departure, but The Independent on Sunday reported at the time that she was believed to be unhappy that she had been overlooked for Sergeant's job in favour of the then Washington correspondent, James Mates. Andrews left ITN in December 2002. In 2008, Andrews founded Ariadne Trust, which was set up to enable European human rights and social change donors to collaborate, to share knowledge and to think through the difficult problems that face them collectively. It currently has more than 600 members. She later became a board member of Mama Cash, as well as Fund for Global Human Rights, two leading charity organizations. She has also co-founded Equileap together with Diana van Maasdijk, an organisation aiming at speeding up progress towards gender equality in the workplace.

History In 1979, CBS Records (now Columbia Records) ended its partnership with Caytronics after eleven years of distribution. CBS established its own division for Latin music in 1980 called CBS Discos (also known as Discos CBS). In 1988, CBS Records was acquired by Sony and its Latin division was renamed to Sony Discos in 1991. In 2003, Sony Discos was re-branded as Sony Norte following the departure of former Sony Discos president Oscar Llord.

Venezuela officially recognized the State of Palestine and established diplomatic relations with the Palestinian Authority on 27 April 2009. History During the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict between Israel and Hezbollah Chávez expelled the Israeli ambassador to Venezuela and downgraded economic and military accords between Venezuela and Israel. Chávez also compared Israel's actions to Hitler and the Nazis. During a visit to both Russia and China in 2006 Chavez called for Israeli leaders to be tried in the International Criminal Court. According to Nikhil Shah of Z Magazine, Chávez's speeches and verbal attacks against Israel had earned him praise throughout the entire Arab World. Since then Venezuela has strengthened its ties with Russia, China, Cuba and Iran in order to counter the support that Israel receives from the United States. With the 2008-2009 Gaza War, Venezuela cut off all diplomatic ties with Israel and expelled the Israeli ambassador from Caracas. After breaking diplomatic relations with Israel in January 2009 in protest at the invasion, Venezuela's Foreign Ministry said in September 2009 it would depend on Spain to represent its interests in Israel.Associated Press, Haaretz, 16 September 2009, Venezuela: Spain will represent our interests in Israel Israel's interests in Venezuela would be represented by Canada.Canada-Israel Committee, 5 August 2009, Canada to Help Israel with Visas in Venezuela On 27 April 2009 Venezuela had officially recognized the State of Palestine and has supported the Palestinian cause in the United Nations, being the first country in the Americas to do so.

History In 1853, the village purchased 13 acres from Andrew Porteus of Queensbury, New York for the sum of $1000, with $500 set aside for grading and fencing. The first burial took place in 1855, but there are several older markers which were moved here from the old West Street Cemetery in the early 1870s. After several expansions, the cemetery now spans 32 acres with over 12,000 burials.

Moore. Plot Six animal heroes called the Danger Rangers, their robot Fallbot, and their artificial intelligence called SAVO teach children about safety through examples, such as environmental hazards and unsafe places. Characters * Sully (voiced by Jerry Houser) – A blue sea lion. He is the leader and spokesanimal of the Danger Rangers. He cares a lot about his appearance, but also takes his duties as leader seriously. * Kitty (voiced by Grey DeLisle) – A pink cat. She is the intelligent, cool and adventurous second-in-command of the group. She is also helpful and resourceful, and strongly believes in playing fair. * Burble (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) – A large polar bear. He is the strong and humorous recreational safety expert. He is also the group's \\"gentle giant\\" and prefers to play both fair and safe. * Squeeky (voiced by Rob Paulsen) – A navy mouse. He is small, yet very valuable to the Danger Rangers. With his size, he can fix any problem which otherwise proves to be too small for the others to handle. * Burt (voiced by Mark Hamill) – A green turtle. He is the team's creative and genuine personal safety expert. As the team's inventor, Burt would always come up with some inventions, including Fallbot, that would help the Danger Rangers in their missions. * Gabriela (voiced by Tasia Valenza) – A red hummingbird. She is the operations chief and head safety trainer. While others go out on the field during a mission, she also acts as a supervisor. Of course, sometimes she joins the mission. She is also called G.B. * Fallbot (voiced by John Kassir) – A robot who was invented by Burt. He is the eager yet clumsy ally of the Danger Rangers. He is very inquisitive when it comes to learning about safety rules but sometimes his talkativeness can make others annoyed at times. * SAVO (voiced by Charlie Adler in most episodes, Jonathan Harris in \\"Mission 547: Safety Rules\\") – The artificial intelligence of the Danger Rangers' base who alerts them of any safety trouble. His name is an acronym, as it means \\"Safety Alert Vectometer\\" (as shown in \\"Mission 547: Safety Rules\\"). He also somewhat has a flair for the dramatic. * Junior Danger Rangers – Various children who are future experts at different safety rules that work with the Danger Rangers, who some even look up to.

After Douglas Smith and Michael Moore approached West about creating a live-action self-defense video for children, West suggested a video using animated anthropomorphic characters instead of live children. Also, the focus shifted from self-defense to more general safety habits and tips. West went to work and created an adventure team of characters that would teach kids about safety through various short vignettes or scenarios and called them the \\"Danger Rangers\\". The script, scenarios, names, designs... everything was created by this one-man production team. West went on to create all of the animation (with help from his twin brother, Scott West) and produced the pilot using local voice talent with West himself completing the final editing and sound effects. However, the first Hollywood production was completed in 2003. The show was created from the cause of children's safety and was the first show to successfully put Disney-quality productions into a quality curriculum. Danger Rangers was the most successfully distributed independent show on PBS affiliates and was documented to have saved lives. Broadcast The series originally aired on PBS Kids back in the show's run, and then from September 2011 to September 2012, reruns aired on CBS as part of Cookie Jar TV. Business dealings Educational Adventures (the original company behind the show) built distribution through grassroots efforts and deals with Virgin Atlantic and Safe Kids Worldwide. The assets of the company were eventually lost in a lawsuit after the liquidation of the company. This left Mike D. Moore to seek to regain control and restart the show.

Built in the Greek Revival style in 1845, it was once the grand home of one of Bloomington's leading citizens. After many years of use, it fell into disrepair and was endangered by the possibility of destruction, but restoration has led to its designation as a historic site due to its authentic period architecture. Elias Abel Born in 1800 in Wythe County, Virginia, Abel moved to the Bloomington vicinity in 1824 and began to farm.Klassen, Teri. \\"Owners seek loan to restore historic house on Fairview.\\" The Herald- Times, 1985-06-03. At this time, southwestern Indiana was very rural; Bloomington likely had no more than six hundred residents in 1824, but it was the most prosperous town in its region of the state.Blanchard, Charles, ed. Counties of Morgan, Monroe and Brown, Indiana: Historical and Biographical. Chicago: F.A. Battey, 1884. Between 1841 and 1862, he was active in local politics; he served multiple terms as the Monroe County treasurer, and he was elected to serve in the Indiana General Assembly from 1856 to 1857. After finishing his Bloomington house in 1845, Abel lived on the property until 1856; he had purchased the property for just $250, but he sold it for $1,000. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. After residing elsewhere for four years, he purchased a nearby house now known as the Blair-Dunning House; in 1862, he sold it to the future wife of Paris C. Dunning, later Governor of Indiana. Into his old age, Abel continued to be both healthy and prominent in the community, keeping his reputation as one of Monroe County's leading Democrats into his mid-eighties. =After Abel= Following several decades of use as the residence of its owners, the house was converted into a rental property in 1923; it soon began to deteriorate due to a lack of necessary maintenance. During this time, the porch was expanded, the exterior was covered with poor-quality brown asphalt siding, and the original exterior woodwork deteriorated; by the late 1970s, both the original and the later elements were crumbling. Architecture =Structure= The structure of the house is typical of the design known as the \\"I-house\\" — its two stories are each divided into two rooms, one on each side. Such a plan is typical of the vernacular architecture of Monroe County in the middle of the nineteenth century: the area's early settlers generally favored the \\"I plan\\", finding it simple and sufficient for their needs without sacrificing elegance. Few such houses remain in a condition closely resembling their early years; despite the changes made to it, the Abel House has been named Bloomington's best extant \\"I\\"-house. Major structural elements of the house include a pitched roof made of composites and wooden eaves, a large basement with limestone walls and a fruit cellar, and multiple brick chimneys. During its history, the house has received two additions on its western (rear) side: a saltbox-style on the southwestern corner, and a simpler style on the northwestern corner. Individuals may enter the house through a central main entrance; flanked by two windows on each side, the door is surrounded by transoms that may include some original glass. =Details= The house has been ranked as a fine example of the popular version of the Greek Revival style of architecture. A frame structure two stories tall, the house was built with a small portico at the entrance; when it was later expanded to a large porch, almost all of the original portico was removed. Some original elements survived the modifications of the twentieth century; the most important of these are the pilasters on the corners of the house. Inside, many more original elements survive than on the exterior. Significant among these are the rail, balusters, and steps of the main staircase, which are made of hand-planed cherry wood, and the mantel over the main fireplace. Other distinctive features include transoms over all interior doorways in the house's southern portion and a walnut log in the attic, which was a traditional element used to bring good luck to the house. Recognition A renaissance began for the Abel House in 1976, when the city of Bloomington designated it a historic site, thus preserving it from almost certain demolition; one year later, it was purchased by a couple who soon began to renovate it and applied for loans to aid in restoring it. In 1982, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its well-preserved historic architecture; key to its inclusion was its place as the city's best example of an \\"I\\"-house and as the home of one of the most prominent residents of early Bloomington. Fifteen years after the house was added to the Register, much of the city's west side was designated a historic district, the Bloomington West Side Historic District; the Abel House was named one of the most important of the district's hundreds of contributing properties.Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory.

Research Rolf Reber is known for his research on processing fluency, especially the processing fluency theory of aesthetic pleasure he developed together with Norbert Schwarz from the University of Michigan and Piotr Winkielman from the University of California at San Diego.Reber, R., Schwarz, N., Winkielman, P.: \\"Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: Is beauty in the perceiver's processing experience?\\", Personality and Social Psychology Review, 8(4):364–382. The core assumption of the theory is that an audience draws aesthetic pleasure from the fact that an object can be processed easily, especially if a viewer remains unaware of the source of this processing ease. Theory resolution This theory resolves an apparent contradiction between the uniformity of musical preferences in infants and the cultural differences of musical tastes in adults. Infants prefer consonant melodies because newborns share biological mechanisms that make them process consonance in music more easily than dissonance. When children grow up, they are exposed to the music of their culture, explaining why individuals from different cultures have different musical tastes. In addition, research found that processing fluency influences both affectReber, R., Winkielman, P. & Schwarz, N. (1998). Effects of perceptual fluency on affective judgments. Psychological Science, 9, 45–48. and the judged truth of statements,Reber, R., & Schwarz, N. (1999). Effects of perceptual fluency on judgments of truth. Consciousness and Cognition, 8, 338–342. suggesting that ease of processing is a common underlying experience in both perceived beauty and judged truth. Observation This observation fits anecdotal observations that mathematicians and scientists sometimes use beauty of a theorem as an indication for its truth, an idea that has been explored in more recent work.Reber, R., Brun, M., & Mitterndorfer, K.

Instructional technique More recently, Rolf Reber and his collaborators have developed and explored Example Choice, an instructional technique designed to increase relevance and student interest in the learning of abstract principles in mathematics and science. Students are given examples from different topics that all address the same underlying principle, and a student has to choose the example that interests him or her most. The chosen example is then used to explain the formal principle. This technique is supposed to connect the formal principle to students’ interest. Research has shown that students become more interested and spend more time learning the principle when they can choose an example than when they are given an example.Reber, R., Hetland, H., Chen, W., Norman, E., & Kobbeltvedt, T.

It contains three highly conserved regions, and mediates protein-protein interactions between the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and signal-transduction components. TIR-like motifs are also found in plant proteins thought to be involved in resistance to disease. When activated, TIR domains recruit cytoplasmic adaptor proteins MyD88 (UniProt ) and TOLLIP (Toll interacting protein, UniProt ). In turn, these associate with various kinases to set off signaling cascades. In Drosophila melanogaster the Toll protein is involved in establishment of dorso-ventral polarity in the embryo. In addition, members of the Toll family play a key role in innate antibacterial and antifungal immunity in insects as well as in mammals. These proteins are type-I transmembrane receptors that share an intracellular 200 residue domain with the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), the Toll/IL-1R homologous region (TIR). The similarity between Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and IL-1R is not restricted to sequence homology since these proteins also share a similar signaling pathway. They both induce the activation of a Rel type transcription factor via an adaptor protein and a protein kinase. MyD88, a cytoplasmic adaptor protein found in mammals, contains a TIR domain associated to a DEATH domain (see ). Besides the mammalian and Drosophila melanogaster proteins, a TIR domain is also found in a number of plant proteins implicated in host defense. As MyD88, these proteins are cytoplasmic. Site directed mutagenesis and deletion analysis have shown that the TIR domain is essential for Toll and IL-1R activities. Sequence analysis have revealed the presence of three highly conserved regions among the different members of the family: box 1 (FDAFISY), box 2 (GYKLC-RD-PG), and box 3 (a conserved W surrounded by basic residues). It has been proposed that boxes 1 and 2 are involved in the binding of proteins involved in signaling, whereas box 3 is primarily involved in directing localization of receptor, perhaps through interactions with cytoskeletal elements.

She committed fraud with a series of false identities, posing as mamsell, noblewoman, officer, Count and the Crown Prince of Sweden before her arrest in 1765. First fraud In June 1765, Anna Ekelöf was arrested dressed in male clothing in Värmland near the Swedish-Norwegian border. Being put on trial for investigation, she was revealed to have committed a serial of identity frauds. Witnesses testified that she was first encountered in the border area dressed as a mamsell, claiming to be on the run to marry her beloved, who was not approved by her parents. After this, she dressed herself as a nobleman with a white wig and introduced herself as Count Carl Ekeblad, who had been forced to escape Sweden dressed as a woman after having been exiled from Stockholm due to an incident, and who was awaiting the King's forgiveness to return. As Count Ekeblad, she had recruited a retinue of Swedes and Norwegians, among them the runaway Swedish farmer Olof Persson, the runaway Swedish baker Schutlz, who acted as servants, as well as the wife of Police officer Istmin, Emerentia Schröder, \\"To dance and ammuse himself with\\". She was housed at the Löfsnäs manor in Norway, belong to the sister of Emerentia. During her time as Count, Ekelöf lived a \\"debauched life with drinking, foul language, foolhardily riding and a never ending use of tobacco\\", and was also known to threaten and struck people who opposed her. She defended herself by saying that she had only acted in such a way to be trustworthy in her role as a man. Second fraud At the customary office of Magnebro, she then had rumors spread which let it be known that she was in fact the Swedish Crown Prince in disguise who, in a conflict with riksråd Count Carl Gustaf Tessin and the nobility party of the parliament, had come to prepare a coup d'etat to depose the government. This was in fact not an unlikely rumor, as there was at the time many serious rumors circulating about planned uprisings against the government since the Coup of 1756 by Queen Louisa Ulrika. The actual Crown Prince was in the same age and with the same fragile built as Ekelöf, and Anna Ekelöf was furthermore equipped with a vast and up to date knowledge about the current political situation. When rumors reached the Danish-Norwegian authorities in Oslo that someone alleged to be the Swedish heir to the throne was present at the border, Ekelöf was taken captive and brought to Oslo, where her identity as a woman was discovered. She was apparently allowed to return to the border, but was soon after arrested by the Swedish authorities, who subjected her to a physical examination to establish her gender. Trial Anna Ekelöf admitted posing as a Count, but denied to have ever posed as the heir to the throne, and if so, only under the intoxication of alcohol. She stated that she was the 20-year-old daughter of a diseased sea captain in Gothenburg, and that she had run away from home to elope and meet her beloved, sergeant Magnus Sandberg, in Norway, where they could marry without the approval of his disapproving parents. She had not intended to pose as a man, she had merely put the clothes on, after having been provided them by a runaway Swedish baker on the way, because her own clothes had been damaged during the trip and the nobleman clothes was nearer to her social class as a mamsell. The whole posing as a count was merely an innocent play while she awaited to be united with her beloved. The authorities, furthermore, suspected her to have eloped over the border with the purpose of performing an abortion, and suggested that her relationship with Magnus Sandberg was in fact incestuous. During the trial, it was discovered that she on several previous occasions had left a trace of false identities: she had, on various occasions, posed as a runaway girl, fleeing from an arranged marriage to marry her true love. The story of a girl eloping for love dressed as a man was a popular motive in contemporary novels, a story she apparently used often in past deceptions. The only testimony that may give a suggestion to her real identity, was a testimony given a previous trial, in which she had been imprisoned at Halmstad Castle. At that occasion, care taker Emanuel Bergman from Borås pointed her out to be the same person as a certain ”Passannicka” ('Pass Port-Annicka'), who had previously been subjected to physical punishment for crimes committed in Borås and exiled from that city.Jonas Liliequist: \\"'Att inte kunna förställa sig är att inte kunna leva' - om personlighet, identitet och kön i 1600- och 1700-talens Sverige\\" i Tom Eriksson & Agneta, Guillemot (red) Individ och struktur i historisk belysning. Festskrift till Sune Åkerman (Umeå 1997). Aftermath The true identity of Anna Ekelöf was never established, as she managed to escape custody and was never caught again. On her way to court to hear her verdict, the prison carriage broke down, and the party was forced to spend the night on the farm of the peasant Nils Amundsson. She managed to convince him that she was indeed the crown prince in disguise, and that he would be richly rewarded if he assisted her escape. The night of 12–13 June 1765, Amundsson knocked on her window, and she climbed out and mounted a horse he provided her, rode of toward the Norwegian border and was never seen again. Amundsson claimed that he had been so \\"intoxicated\\" by her talk that he had become \\"prepared to sacrifice his life and property\\" for her.Jonas Liliequist: \\"'Att inte kunna förställa sig är att inte kunna leva' - om personlighet, identitet och kön i 1600- och 1700-talens Sverige\\" i Tom Eriksson & Agneta, Guillemot (red) Individ och struktur i historisk belysning. Festskrift till Sune Åkerman (Umeå 1997). Anna Ekelöf was not the only female criminal posing as a man in early modern Sweden. Kerstin Pedersdotter ran away from her abusive husband dressed as a man under the name Christopher and took refuge with her stepbrother, with whom she made a theft tour through the countryside, and was, similar to Ekelöf, accused of having dressed as a man to hide an incestuous relationship. Gunilla Harberg, known as ”Tjuv-Gunnil” (Gunnil the Thief), had escaped to Karlskrona dressed as a man under the name Gunnar after a burglary in Kalmar.

This species can be found at depths ranging from the surface to . This species reaches in SL. This species feeds primarily on bony fish, rising to the surface at night to feed. It can also be found in the aquarium trade. Description Xiphasia matsubarai has an elongated body that resembles an eel, and has a dorsal fin that covers the whole length of the body. They have gray-brown stripes that cover the length of their bodies starting at the head. The head is small and it is rounded anteriorly. The eyes are slightly smaller and located near the lateral sides of the head. It does not have any scales. They have a single row of incisor teeth and large canines. The bottom canines are significantly longer than the canines in the upper jaw. The article identified distinct morphological characteristics and sequence analysis that helped identify X. matsubarai. Smith-Vanzi and Shen made important comparisons between the X. matsubarai and the X. sefiter, which included fin length and color. This supported the initial discovery of the snake blenny.

Biography Meulman was born in Amsterdam. He began tagging as Shoe in 1979 and was a graffiti legend by the time he was 18. In the eighties Shoe met New York artists like DONDI, Rammellzee, Haze and Quik in Amsterdam. Inspired by their New York Graffiti style he joined the graffiti crew Crime Time Kings with Bando from Paris and Mode2 from London. Together they gave a distinctive style to graffiti in Europe. He also meets Keith Haring in 1986, while Haring is staring at the wall piece \\"Better Times\\" Meulman painted on an insane asylum in Amsterdam. They hung out. Meulman recalls: “Keith drew something in my black book. Which ended up stolen, but I managed to get it back a couple of years later – but without his drawing for me. That drawing turned up at a Christie’s auction in 1994 and was bought by a French collector.” In the 1990s, Meulman advanced his technique by apprenticing under the Dutch graphic design master Anthon Beeke (1989–1992). He ran his own design company, Caulfield & Tensing (1992–1999), with Michael Schaeffer, enabled by start up funds from Internet entrepreneur Walter de Brouwer. The advertising agency FHV BBDO took over the company, and employed Meulman as senior art director (1999–2001). Upon leaving the agency he was partner with Dennis Polak in the advertising agency Unruly. Under the name Unruly a line of luxury silk scarves was produced. Commercial works of note include a signature shoe (sneaker) design for the British sports brand Umbro; the creative direction of the magazine WAVE; the re-styling of the Dutch television channel TMF; and packaging calligraphy for Bols Genever. In 2012 Meulman was commissioned by Louis Vuitton to feature alongside the spoken word artist yasiin bey aka Mos Def in the tribute video series Muhammad Ali – The Greatest Words. Mos Def recites Ali's poetic speeches while Meulman elaborates with painted calligraphy on the platform of a boxing ring. “When we were asked to pose as boxers in the ring for the Louis Vuitton videos, he uttered the words ‘strike a poser.’ Shoe is a painter of words.” —yasiin bey aka Mos Def. With the avant-garde shoe design company United Nude the \\"Unruly Shoe\\" was designed, which \\"measures in at five inches tall and features details like laser-cut leather (which spells the words \\"unruly shoe\\"), a back zipper, and a spiked stiletto heel.\\" Rem D. Koolhaas, creative director and co-founder of United Nude recalls: \\"At Art Basel Miami 2012, for the launch of the shoe collaboration dubbed NSMxUN, Shoe painted a 1984 stretched Cadillac Brougham. The original plan was for Shoe to paint a wall in Wynwood, but after we found this car, the plan became to paint it, as a painted car is the most mobile form of street art. In the following years the car was showcased in New York City and San Francisco.” Calligraffiti Shoe calls his art of writing Calligraffiti, an art form that fuses calligraphy and graffiti. He launched this movement in 2007 with a solo exhibition in Amsterdam under the same name. It was “a personal way to translate street work to gallery work.” Since then, his Calligraffiti pieces (signed NSM) have been seen in various international exhibitions in Europe and North America. In March, 2010 the book 'Calligraffiti - the Graphic Art of Niels Shoe Meulman' was published by From Here To Fame Publishing in Berlin. John Langdon, the ambigram artist who wrote the preface, is quoted in the book about the first time he met Shoe and saw his work: 'You are as good as me. Only I did more.\\" Eye Magazine, the international review of graphic design, reviewed the book in their Summer 2010 issue: “As journalist and editor Adam Eeuwens explains in his introduction, calligraffiti is a ‘curious amalgam of an ancient, refined art form fused with the raw force of modern street art … a synthesis of opposites.’ The book explores Meulman's capacity to express written comparisons in a viscerally understandable form. Pairings range from love / money to strict / loose to rural / urban – all bearing additional dimensions of visual irony and depth ... The illustrative nature of Meulman's words makes their apprehension feel less like reading than hearing: understood so quickly that they are impossible to ignore or shut out. Beyond the cacophony is a reserve of pent-up energy, an abhorrence of complacency, and a crisp exploration of contrast mediated by masterful craft.” On the Spanish blog Hidden People Meulman explains what makes a good calligraffiti: “Directness in the whole, finesse in the details. An even balance between seeing and reading, word and image. I like it when letters, writing and language itself becomes an image or an abstraction. On the other hand, basic shapes and splats can become language. This is what my painting is about.” In 2015 Meulman decided to emancipate the art form of Calligraffiti. In a statement released by Galerie Gabriel Rolt, the artist stated: “There are people all over the world who write/paint in a similar way, and so the art form can now flourish without me. Besides, my own painting style is getting more abstract and the term Calligraffiti no longer suits it. For the Calligraffiti Facebook page—with over half a million likes—twenty-five ambassadors will be selected to manage its online community. Together they can determine the future of the art form.” Calligraffiti has become a worldwide phenomenon and plays a significant role within Urban Contemporary Art, sparked by Meulman's adage: “A word is an image and writing is painting.” “It cannot be said enough, but, had it not been for Shoe and the Calligraffiti that he set into motion, there would not have been such a resurgence of lettering in the wider field of “urban art...reigniting the pursuit of style where it had been on the wane. ” writes Mode2 in 2017 on his blog.  Unruly Gallery  In 2011 Meulman founded Unruly Gallery with Adele Renault, a gallery by artists for artists. Operating from a garage in the blue collar neighborhood Staatsliedenbuurt, Unruly Gallery's run as a physical location started in May, 2011 with a one weekend group show, and followed in quick succession with solo exhibitions of artists such as Quik, Paul du Bois-Reymond, Arno Coenen, Wayne Horse. Egs, Nug, a reunion of the Crime Time Kings, a few art fairs and multiple group shows. Since 2014 the gallery has moved exclusively to online exhibitions, with a focus on urban contemporary art forms such as Calligraffiti, Keep It Realism, Urban Surrealism, and Abstract Vandalism, presenting a platform for nearly 30 carefully curated artists to sell their works.  Abstract vandalism  In 1986 the Dutch daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad run a full-page interview with Meulman with the headline “Ik ben een vandaal.” (I am a vandal). In 2012 Berlin publishing house From Here to Fame published \\"Niels Shoe Meulman: Painter;\\" “an avalanche of visual poetry and poetic visuals. A story about an artist who rejected being called an artist, but (...) became a globetrotting painter after all… where street art meets abstract expressionism. Messing up book sections. Again.” It is a style he calls Abstract Vandalism. Accompanying the release of the book, art critic Carlo McCormick had this endorsement: \\"The art world is a bloody mess, it takes a man with a broom like Shoe to clean it up,\\" while fellow visual artist Shepard Fairey added: \\"Shoe's art harnesses the poetic tension between control and chaos in the most beautiful way.\\" Design professor and fellow lettering artist Peter Gilderdale writes in the introduction of the book: “In his art, the graphic designer, the calligrapher, and the tagger blend into a single entity. … Artists from Kandinsky through Jackson Pollock have played with this synesthetic overlap of sound and vision, and Shoe’s pieces similarly juxtapose multiple fields and connect multiple spheres of practice. Here gesture, culture, and concept coalesce in a complex contemporary mix that signals it as art for today.” “When I was younger I wanted to design typefaces. But when I realised how much work that entailed, I became a calligrapher. And when I realised how much work that entailed, I became a painter. Now I realise that abstract painting is the hardest work of all. I am a painter who uses the skills of type design, lettering and calligraphy.” In 2015 Galerie Gabriel Rolt presents the group exhibition Abstract Vandalism, curated by Meulman and with new works by Egs, Nug and Shoe. The show is accompanied by a catalogue with the same name, published by Unruly Publishing, and includes a manifesto by Meulman: “It’s my uneducated guess that half of all emerging visual artists have –at some point- used the street as a medium. To group all these artists as one movement is nonsense. True, graffiti/street art is the only undeniable art movement since pop art, but where urban attitude was once a unifier, now ideas and styles are very divided. It’s time for a separate direction we call Abstract Vandalism.” See also * Calligraffiti  References  • Chalfant, Henry; Prigoff, James (1987). Spraycan Art.

The extensions and the proprietary product implementing the extensions were developed by Ateji which went out of business in September 2011. OptimJ aims at providing a clear and concise algebraic notation for optimization modeling, removing compatibility barriers between optimization modeling and application programming tools, and bringing software engineering techniques such as object-orientation and modern IDE support to optimization experts. OptimJ models are directly compatible with Java source code, existing Java libraries such as database access, Excel connection or graphical interfaces. OptimJ is compatible with development tools such as Eclipse, CVS, JUnit or JavaDoc. OptimJ is available free with the following solvers: lp_solve, glpk, LP or MPS file formats and also supports the following commercial solvers: Gurobi, MOSEK, IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio. Language concepts OptimJ combines concepts from object-oriented imperative languages with concepts from algebraic modeling languages for optimization problems. Here we will review the optimization concepts added to Java, starting with a concrete example. The example of map coloring The goal of a map coloring problem is to color a map so that regions sharing a common border have different colors. It can be expressed in OptimJ as follows. package examples; // a simple model for the map-coloring problem public model SimpleColoring solver lpsolve { // maximum number of colors int nbColors = 4; // decision variables hold the color of each country var int belgium in 1 .. nbColors; var int denmark in 1 .. nbColors; var int germany in 1 .. nbColors; // neighbouring countries must have a different color constraints { belgium != germany; germany != denmark; } // a main entry point to test our model public static void main(String[] args) { // instantiate the model SimpleColoring m = new SimpleColoring(); // solve it m.extract(); m.solve(); // print solutions System.out.println(\\"Belgium: \\" + m.value(m.belgium)); System.out.println(\\"Denmark: \\" + m.value(m.denmark)); System.out.println(\\"Germany: \\" + m.value(m.germany)); } } Readers familiar with Java will notice a strong similarity with this language. Indeed, OptimJ is a conservative extension of Java: every valid Java program is also a valid OptimJ program and has the same behavior. This map coloring example also shows features specific to optimization that have no direct equivalent in Java, introduced by the keywords \`model\`, \`var\`, \`constraints\`. OR-specific concepts =Models= A model is an extension of a Java class that can contain not only fields and methods but also constraints and an objective function. It is introduced by the \`model\` keyword and follows the same rules as class declarations. A non-abstract model must be linked to a solver, introduced by the keyword \`solver\`. The capabilities of the solver will determine what kind of constraints can be expressed in the model, for instance a linear solver such as lp solve will only allow linear constraints. public model SimpleColoring solver lpsolve =Decision variables= Imperative languages such as Java provide a notion of imperative variables, which basically represent memory locations that can be written to and read from. OptimJ also introduces the notion of a decision variable, which basically represents an unknown quantity whose value one is searching. A solution to an optimization problem is a set of values for all its decision variables that respects the constraints of the problem—without decision variables, it would not possible to express optimization problems. The term \\"decision variable\\" comes from the optimization community, but decision variables in OptimJ are the same concept as logical variables in logical languages such as Prolog. Decision variables have special types introduced by the keyword \`var\`. There is a \`var\` type for each possible Java type. // a var type for a Java primitive type var int x; // a var type for a user-defined class var MyClass y; In the map coloring example, decision variables were introduced together with the range of values they may take. var int germany in 1 .. nbColors; This is just a shorthand equivalent to putting a constraint on the variable. =Constraints= Constraints express conditions that must be true in any solution of the problem. A constraint can be any Java boolean expression involving decision variables. In the map coloring example, this set of constraints states that in any solution to the map coloring problem, the color of Belgium must be different from the color of Germany, and the color of Germany must be different from the color of Denmark. constraints { belgium != germany; germany != denmark; } The operator \`!=\` is the standard Java not- equal operator. Constraints typically come in batches and can be quantified with the \`forall\` operator. For instance, instead of listing all countries and their neighbors explicitly in the source code, one may have an array of countries, an array of decision variables representing the color of each country, and an array \`boolean[][] neighboring\` or a predicate (a boolean function) \`boolean isNeighbor()\`. constraints { forall(Country c1 : countries, Country c2 : countries, :isNeighbor(c1,c2)) { color[c1] != color[c2]; } } \`Country c1 : countries\` is a generator: it iterates \`c1\` over all the values in the collection \`countries\`. \`:isNeighbor(c1,c2)\` is a filter: it keeps only the generated values for which the predicate is true (the symbol \`:\` may be read as \\"if\\"). Assuming that the array \`countries\` contains \`belgium\`, \`germany\` and \`denmark\`, and that the predicate \`isNeighbor\` returns \`true\` for the couples (\`Belgium \`, \`Germany\`) and (\`Germany\`, \`Denmark\`), then this code is equivalent to the constraints block of the original map coloring example. =Objectives= Optionally, when a model describes an optimization problem, an objective function to be minimized or maximized can be stated in the model. Generalist concepts Generalist concepts are programming concepts that are not specific to OR problems and would make sense for any kind of application development. The generalist concepts added to Java by OptimJ make the expression of OR models easier or more concise. They are often present in older modeling languages and thus provide OR experts with a familiar way of expressing their models. =Associative arrays= While Java arrays can only be indexed by 0-based integers, OptimJ arrays can be indexed by values of any type. Such arrays are typically called associative arrays or maps. In this example, the array \`age\` contains the age of persons, identified by their name: int[String] age; The type \`int[String]\` denoting an array of \`int\` indexed by \`String\`. Accessing OptimJ arrays using the standard Java syntax: age[\\"Stephan\\"] = 37; x = age[\\"Lynda\\"]; Traditionally, associative arrays are heavily used in the expression of optimization problems. OptimJ associative arrays are very handy when associated to their specific initialization syntax. Initial values can be given in intensional definition, as in: int[String] age = { \\"Stephan\\" -> 37, \\"Lynda\\" -> 29 }; or can be given in extensional definition, as in: int[String] length[String name : names] = name.length(); Here each of the entries \`length[i]\` is initialized with \`names[i].length()\`. =Extended initialization= =Tuples= Tuples are ubiquitous in computing, but absent from most mainstream languages including Java. OptimJ provides a notion of tuple at the language level that can be very useful as indexes in combination with associative arrays. (: int, String :) myTuple = new (: 3, \\"Three\\" :); String s = myTuple#1; Tuple types and tuple values are both written between \`(:\` and \`:)\`. =Ranges= =Comprehensions= Comprehensions, also called aggregates operations or reductions, are OptimJ expressions that extend a given binary operation over a collection of values. A common example is the sum: // the sum of all integers from 1 to 10 int k = sum { i int i in 1 .. 10}; This construction is very similar to the big-sigma summation notation used in mathematics, with a syntax compatible with the Java language. Comprehensions can also be used to build collections, such as lists, sets, multisets or maps: // the set of all integers from 1 to 10 HashSet s = \`hashSet(){ i int i in 1 .. 10}; Comprehension expressions can have an arbitrary expression as target, as in: // the sum of all squares of integers from 1 to 10 int k = sum { i*i int i in 1 .. 10}; They can also have an arbitrary number of generators and filters: // the sum of all f(i,j), for 0<=i<10, 1<=j<=10 and i!=j int k = sum{ f(i,j) int i : 10, int j : 1 .. 10, :i!=j } Comprehension need not apply only to numeric values. Set or multiset- building comprehensions, especially in combination with tuples of strings, make it possible to express queries very similar to SQL database queries: // select name from persons where age > 18 \`multiSet(){ p.name Person p : persons, :p.age > 18 } In the context of optimization models, comprehension expressions provide a concise and expressive way to pre-process and clean the input data, and format the output data. Development environment OptimJ is available as an Eclipse plug-in. The compiler implements a source-to-source translation from OptimJ to standard Java, thus providing immediate compatibility with most development tools of the Java ecosystem. OptimJ GUI and Rapid Prototyping Since the OptimJ compiler knows about the structure of all data used in models, it is able to generate a structured graphical view of this data at compile-time. This is especially relevant in the case of associative arrays where the compiler knows the collections used for indexing the various dimensions. The basic graphical view generated by the compiler is reminiscent of an OLAP cube. It can then be customized in many different ways, from simple coloring up to providing new widgets for displaying data elements. The compiler-generated OptimJ GUI saves the OR expert from writing all the glue code required when mapping graphical libraries to data. It enables rapid prototyping, by providing immediate visual hints about the structure of data. Another part of the OptimJ GUI reports in real time performance statistics from the solver. This information can be used for understanding performance problems and improving solving time. At this time, it is available only for lp_solve. Supported solvers OptimJ is available for free with the following solvers lp_solve, glpk, LP or MPS file formats and also supports the following commercial solvers: Gurobi, Mosek, IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.

History Okmulgee Park is on land that was at the bottom of a vast inland sea 200 to 350 million years ago. The rocks at the park date back to the Pennsylvanian Period. Okmulgee and neighboring Dripping Springs Park are two of the very few places in the world where the rare fossil, Gymnophyllum wardi also known as \\"button coral\\", can be found. The facilities of Okmulgee and Dripping Springs Parks were constructed by the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps. The WPA and CCC were work relief programs for men from unemployed families, established during the Great Depression. As part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, they were designed to combat unemployment during the Great Depression. The WPA and CCC operated in every U.S. state. The men of the WPA and CCC replaced an earthen dam at Okmulgee Lake which was built in 1927. They also built a spillway and many of the park facilities that are still in use today. Both Dripping Springs and Okmulgee Parks became Oklahoma state parks when management of the park was transferred from the city of Okmulgee to the state. The latter became Oklahoma State Park in 1963. Dripping Springs was leased to the state by the city in 1988. In 2015, the parks were removed from the state park system and are again managed by the City of Okmulgee.

These proteins catalyse the attachment of an amino acid to its cognate transfer RNA molecule in a highly specific two-step reaction. These proteins differ widely in size and oligomeric state, and have a limited sequence homology. The 20 aminoacyl- tRNA synthetases are divided into two classes, I and II. Class I aminoacyl- tRNA synthetases contain a characteristic Rossman fold catalytic domain and are mostly monomeric. Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases share an anti- parallel beta-sheet fold flanked by alpha-helices, and are mostly dimeric or multimeric, containing at least three conserved regions. However, tRNA binding involves an alpha-helical structure that is conserved between class I and class II synthetases. In reactions catalysed by the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the aminoacyl group is coupled to the 2'-hydroxyl of the tRNA, while, in class II reactions, the 3'-hydroxyl site is preferred. The synthetases specific for arginine, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, tyrosine, tryptophan and valine belong to class I synthetases; these synthetases are further divided into three subclasses, a, b and c, according to sequence homology.

He was the older brother of Maximilian Mörlin, another Lutheran theologian and Reformer. Early life Mörlin was born at Wittenberg, where his father, Jodok Mörlin, also known as Jodocus Morlinus, was the Professor of Philosophy at the University of Wittenberg. Joachim himself studied at the same University under Luther, Philipp Melanchthon, Justus Jonas, and Casper Cruciger the Elder from 1532 to 1536. After a brief residence at Coburg, he returned to Wittenberg and in 1539 became Luther's chaplain, declining a call to succeed Poliander at Königsberg. While a true pupil of Luther, Mörlin was more influenced by the dogmatics of Melanchthon, though devoid of sympathy with the Philippistic efforts for union with the Reformed. On September 22, 1540, Joachim left Wittenberg to become superintendent at Arnstadt, where, until deposed in March 1543 for his rigid discipline and opposition to union, he displayed great activity, moral earnestness, and courage. But neither the appeal of his congregation nor the sympathy of Luther could overcome the hostility of the Count of Schwartzburg, Günther XL. On May 10, 1544, Mörlin became superintendent at Göttingen. Here he was equally firm in insistence on purity of life and doctrine, and wrote his Enchiridion catecheticum (1544), taught rhetoric in the Latin school, and lectured on Erasmus and the Loci of Melanchthon. Mörlin's activity in Göttingen came to an end with his uncompromising resistance to the union advocated by the Interim. On January 17, 1550, after vain protests by both council and congregation to the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Eric II, Mörlin was dismissed from office. Mörlin went to Erfurt, thence to Arnstadt, and finally to Schleusingen, where he lived and preached in the castle of William IV, the Count of Henneberg. Yet even here Mörlin was not altogether safe, and on August 25, 1550, he left Schleusingen, arriving at Königsberg on September 13. There, since Prussia did not belong constitutionally to the Holy Roman Empire, he could not be molested, and was appointed, on September 27, 1550, pastor at the Kneiphöfer Dom and inspector. Controversy with Osiander There Mörlin became involved in the Osiandrian controversy, for it was not in his nature to remain neutral. However, the break between Mörlin and Osiander was gradual. When the latter defended his view of justification (act. 24, 1550), Mörlin remained a silent witness; but Osiander's work with on the incarnation and the image of God, and still more his Bericht und Trostschrift, with its savage attack on Melanchthon, led Mörlin to complain on February 7, 1551, to Albert of Prussia, though he did this so delicately that the duke commissioned him and Aurifaber, Osiander's son-in-law, to assemble the theologians for the conference which was held February 13–17. Here Mörlin's sincere desire for peace was evident, but his suspicion of Osiander increased, even though the latter claimed to be in harmony with Luther, denying the truth of Mörlin's Antilogia seu contraria doctrina inter Lutherum et Osiandrum. On April 19 Mörlin preached against those who depreciated the merits of Christ, and Osiander rightly took this as directed against himself. The breach was now complete, and after an interchange of recriminations, Mörlin was replaced by Stancarus, professor of Hebrew. Before a new colloquy could be held, however, the duke directed (May 8) first Osiander and then his opponents to present their views in writing. Osiander hesitated, and Mörlin attacked him from the pulpit (May 27). The duke now forced Mörlin to defend his tenets in writing, and further roused him and his followers to passionate resistance by appointing Osiander to administer the bishopric of Samland, and by requiring Mörlin and others to submit to the decision of the church. The characteristic reply (July 21) was that Mörlin and his adherents refused to recognize Osiander's jurisdiction, since he was a heretic, and they appealed to a free synod. Osiander's opponents now continued their attacks and virtually met up a separate church. This was forbidden by the duke (August 12), who sent them Osiander's confession of faith, which was returned unread. The polemics still continued, and Albert in despair sent Osiander's confession to the princes and cities of Germany, urging a synod. Mörlin's position was gaining strength in Prussia, and the majority of the opinions of the churches outside Prussia were also favorable to him. The very refusal of the duke to publish these condemnations of Osiander aided Mörlin, who, on May 23, 1552, published a polemic defending the doctrine of justification against his opponent, in which he clearly set forth the orthodox Wittenberg position, and emphasized the difference between it and Osiander's teaching. Besides continuing to urge the publication of the opinions just mentioned, Mörlin preached a sermon (June, 1552) directed against Osiander, deprecating speculations on the inscrutable essence of God; and Osiander replied with his impassioned Schmeckbier, in which he arraigned Mörlin and his friends. The controversy increased in pettiness and coarseness, until Albert threatened (July 15, 1552) to depose Mörlin, only to receive the respectful but firm reply that Mörlin held it his divinely commissioned duty to polemize against Osiander. Meanwhile, a second opinion came from Württemberg, and from it both Osiander and Mörlin claimed the support of Johann Brenz, but on October 17, 1552, the weary struggle found its end in the death of Osiander, a defeated man. Driven from Königsberg The peace-loving policy of Albert was still to demonstrate its futility. The ambiguity of the Württemberg declaration seemed to him to constitute a good formula of union, and on January 24, 1553, he required that sermons on justification should be preached according to the six Württemberg articles, and that all coarseness should be avoided. This was tantamount to a defense of Osiandrianism, but the great majority of the duke's subjects were opposed, while Mörlin declared himself unable to obey the ducal mandate when contrary to the obligations of religion. This was the only course open to him, but the duke's displeasure was now finally incurred, and on February 16, 1553, he presented his resignation. Three days later he sought refuge in Danzig, where he awaited an expected recall, supported as he was by the council and the citizens. But all appeals to the duke were in vain; and the exile at last resigned himself to his punishment and sought for a new field of activity. Mörlin had not long to wait. Brunswick and Lübeck were rivals for his services; the former won by right of priority, and he entered Brunswick on July 25, 1553. In the following year he received an assistant in the Melanchthonian Martin Chemnitz, and developed a powerful activity, strengthening the Lutheran cause with the aid of the religious peace of Augsburg, and preparing, in 1577, his Leges pro ministerio Brunsvicensi, which all the clergy of his superintendency were required to subscribe when entering upon office. He assailed the Reformed as bitterly as the Roman Catholics. Again, in 1564, the council of Brunswick enacted that the Corpus doctrinae should be subscribed by all theologians, a rule which remained in force until 1672. And this was no dead letter, for in 1566 Johannes Becker, a pastor in Brunswick who had subscribed to the Corpus but become a Calvinist, was forced to resign and ultimately was banished from the city. Meanwhile, Mörlin and Chemnitz were active in other inter-Lutheran controversies and in warding off Calvinistic attacks; and the former was the prime mover in the rejection, by the Brunswick clergy, of the doctrines of Schwenckfeld, besides being one of those asked by the council of Bremen to settle the dispute between Johann Timann and Albert Hardenberg. He furthermore defended Hesshusen in his pamphlet Wider die Landlügen der heidelbergischen Theologen (1565). Efforts for Theological Reconciliation In the struggle with Calvinism Mörlin supported Joachim Westphal, and to this end wrote his Confessio fidei de eucharistiae sacramento ministrorum ecclesiarum Saxonicarum (Magdeburg, 1557). At Coswik he sought to mediate between Melanchthon and Flacius, and in his eagerness for peace, when the delegates of the Hanseatic League assembled at Brunswick, he held a conference with Chemnitz, Westphal, and others (January 14, 1557), and reached an agreement on articles tending to reconcile the adiaphorists and those holding to the true Gospel. Mörlin then took these articles to Flacius at Magdeburg, after which he conferred with Melanchthon at Wittenberg, but returned to Brunswick unsuccessful (January 28, 1557). Eight months later Mörlin went to the Colloquy of Worms, but by his opposition to the Philippists and by his withdrawal helped render the conference resultless. In December, 1558, he visited Weimar and Jena to reconcile Flacius and Strigel, and in 1560 he signed the petition of the Jena theologians to the princes to call a Lutheran synod to combat Calvinism. Mörlin was also a prominent figure at the conference of theologians from Lower Saxony held at Lüneburg in July, 1561, and wrote the confession of faith there drawn up, Erklärung aus Gottes Wort und kurzer Bericht der Artikel, etc. (Magdeburg, Jena, and Regensburg, 1561), which became binding on all pastors in Brunswick; and he again showed his Wittenberg orthodoxy in his Verantwortung der Präfation so für die lüneburgischen Artikel (1562). In 1563 the Council of Wesel asked the opinion of the Brunswick theologians for a ruling on the admission of Reformed refugees from England, and the decision was that the immigrants should be received and instructed; but, should they propagate their erroneous views, they should be expelled. In 1566 and 1567 Mörlin found himself compelled to break with his old friend Flacius because of the latter's teaching on original sin; and at the same time he wrote against the Antinomians his Tres disputationes de tertio usu legis. Recalled to Königsberg Meanwhile, inspired partly by him, the struggle had continued in Prussia between the Melanchthonians and the Osiandrian peace-policy of the court. Well informed of all that went on in Königsberg, Mörlin strengthened his sympathisers with his Historia welcher Gestalt sich die osiandrische Schwärmerei im Lande zu Preussen erhoben (Brunswick, 1554). In 1555 he published two other pamphlets on the course of events in Prussia; and finally Albert found himself obliged to yield. On November 30, 1566, Mörlin was invited to return to Prussia, but he declined to leave Brunswick. The invitation was repeated, however (January 31, 1567), and after much persuasion Mörlin accepted and obtained leave of absence from the reluctant Council of Brunswick. On April 9, 1567, he and Chemnitz were joyfully welcomed in Königsberg, and at once began the restoration of Melanchthonian orthodoxy. After much consideration it was decided that the confessional bases should remain the Augsburg Confession, the Apology, and the Schmalkald Articles, the only change being the correction of certain false doctrines which had crept in since the formulation of the Augsburg Confession. The duke, assenting to the rejection of Osiandrianism, readily agreed, and on May 6 Mörlin and Chemnitz gave him their Repetitio corporis doctrinae Christianae, refuting Osiandrianism, Synergism, Antinomianism, Majorism, and similar teachings. Accepted by the synod and the estates, the Repetitio was proclaimed by Albert on July 8, 1567, and Prussia was at last free from theological rancor. Becomes Bishop of Samland Though offered the bishopric of Samland, and though urged by clergy and laity alike to remain in Prussia, Mörlin still felt bound to Brunswick. Accordingly, promised by the estates (June 8, 1567) that no Calvinists should be allowed at court, he returned to Brunswick. But his stay there was brief, and he was unexpectedly released. Learning that a patricide had been let go free, both he and Chemmtz sharply upbraided the magistracy in a sermon on July 13, and were cited to appear before the court. Under these circumstances the envoys of Albert succeeded in inducing the council, unwilling though it was even then, to let Mörlin go (September 24, 1567). He was now declared bishop of Samland, while Chemnitz was made superintendent. Henceforth until his death, in his new office, Mörlin was active in preaching and catechizing, never ceasing to polemize against Philippists, Synergists, and, above all, Calvinists.

These proteins differ widely in size and oligomeric state, and have limited sequence homology. The 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are divided into two classes, I and II. Class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases contain a characteristic Rossmann fold catalytic domain and are mostly monomeric. Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases share an anti-parallel beta-sheet fold flanked by alpha-helices, and are mostly dimeric or multimeric, containing at least three conserved regions. However, tRNA binding involves an alpha-helical structure that is conserved between class I and class II synthetases. In reactions catalysed by the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the aminoacyl group is coupled to the 2'-hydroxyl of the tRNA, while, in class II reactions, the 3'-hydroxyl site is preferred. The synthetases specific for arginine, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, tyrosine, tryptophan and valine belong to class I synthetases; these synthetases are further divided into three subclasses, a, b and c, according to sequence homology. The synthetases specific for alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glycine, histidine, lysine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, and threonine belong to class-II synthetases. Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase () is a class Ic synthetase and shows several similarities with glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase concerning structure and catalytic properties. It is an alpha2 dimer. To date one crystal structure of a glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (Thermus thermophilus) has been solved. The molecule has the form of a bent cylinder and consists of four domains. The N-terminal half (domains 1 and 2) contains the 'Rossman fold' typical for class I synthetases and resembles the corresponding part of E. coli GlnRS, whereas the C-terminal half exhibits a GluRS-specific structure.

The defendant, elementary school teacher and amateur skydiver Els 'Babs' Clottemans, was found guilty of murder by sabotaging the parachutes of another woman, fellow skydiver Els Van Doren, because Van Doren was a rival for the love of Marcel Somers, also a skydiver.  Victim  Els Van Doren was a 38-year-old mother of two, married to an Antwerp jeweller. Van Doren was an experienced skydiver who had performed 2,300 jumps prior to her death. Van Doren and Els Clottemans were friends. At one point, Van Doren suggested that everyone in the skydiving club call her younger friend “Babs”, so there would be less confusion. One week before the murder, Van Doren spent the night with Marcel Somers at his house, along with Clottemans. There was no indication that Van Doren was aware of Somers' relationship with Clottemans.  Crime  On 18 November 2006, 12 members of a skydiving club that included Van Doren, Somers, and Clotteman flew over Flanders. Van Doren and Clottemans were supposed to link hands with Somers and another man in a skydiving quartet. Van Doren died when both her primary and reserve parachutes failed to deploy. The dive was captured by a video camera mounted on Van Doren's helmet. Van Doren dropped from a height of more than landing in a garden in the town of Opglabbeek. Police later established that the cords of the parachute had been cut.  Case Evidence  The prosecution offered almost no forensic evidence at trial, and case was entirely circumstantial, although part of the crime was filmed by Van Doren's own helmet camera. She is initially seen jumping from the plane with Clottemans, Somers, and another man, who all link hands in the air. When the quartet release hands at 4,500 ft. (about 1,400 m), Van Doren discovers that neither of her parachutes will deploy, and is seen wildly tugging at her straps, to no avail. = Motive = Clottemans became a suspect when she attempted suicide just before she was going to give a second statement to police, a month after the incident. Police later learned that both Van Doren and Clottemans had a sexual relationship with Somers. Investigators were not able to determine if Van Doren knew that Somers also had a relationship with Clottemans. = Opportunity = The prosecutors alleged that Clottemans had the opportunity to sabotage Van Doren's parachute the week before the fatal jump, when Clottemans, Van Doren, and Somers all spent the weekend at Somers' home, with Clottemans sleeping in the living room while the other two were in the bedroom. According to the allegation, Clottemans would have had the opportunity to cut Van Doren's parachute's cables, as the parachute was in the apartment, and experts estimated that it would have taken no more than 30 seconds to have cut the cables with scissors. While normally the three would jump together to create a formation, during the jump in question, Clottemans stayed on the plane a few extra seconds and watched Van Doren's dive from above.  Trial  Clottemans was charged and arrested in January 2007, but released on bail in 2008. Her trial began on 24 September 2010 with jury selection and ended on 20 October 2010 with a conviction. Media interest in the trial was so great that \\"a room next to the courthouse had to be used for journalists to follow the proceedings through remote video.\\" After the trial began, Clottemans, who maintained her innocence, was placed on suicide watch. On 22 October 2010, Clottemans was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment. In sentencing her to 30 years rather than life, the judge took \\"her feeble psychological condition\\" as an extenuating circumstance. = Sentence = Clottemans appealed the verdict on the ground that she was interrogated by police without the presence of her attorney. The appeal was denied in May 2011.

Distribution  Most species of Perrottetia live in India, but there are additional species of this genus known from Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, North to South Vietnam and Hainan Island and Taiwan in Southern China. The distribution of the genus Perrottetia includes also Mascarenes. There is a concentration of 11 species in the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats of peninsular India and two species are recorded from Sri Lanka, one of which is endemic. Description The most prominent characters of Perrottetia are the sub-oblique heliciform shell, often with whorls coiling around an oblique axis. The last whorls do not descend below the preceding whorl, and short longitudinal furrows are present behind the apertural lip. Internally, the aperture possesses two parietal lamellae. Up to 2013, Perrottetia gudei was the only Perrottetia for which were published information about its internal anatomy. The shell is oblique- heliciform, usually thin and opaque. Its surface is smooth and glossy but fine transverse ridges may be present. The embryonic shell is smooth. The 5–7 whorls increase regularly. The shell periphery is usually rounded and the last whorl does not descend below the preceding whorl but is parallel to the preceding suture. The outer wall of the last whorl generally possesses two short longitudinal furrows that correspond with internal apertural lamellae. The umbilicus is narrow and deep. The semi-ovate aperture has an expanded peristome with a reflexed lip. The apertural dentition consists of two parietal lamellae; palatal, basal and columellar lamellae are usually present; upper palatal and supracolumellar lamellae may also be present. Living animals possess a yellowish to reddish reticulated skin. The brown digestive gland and the black kidney are visible through the transparent shell. The upper tentacles are longer than the lower pair with a black eye-spot on the tip of the fully extended tentacle. Bright red or yellow retractor muscles show though the transparent skin. The foot is narrow, undivided. The tail short. Reproductive system: Genitalia has a long, slender penis. Penial sheath is short, about half of penis length. Internal wall of introverted penis with black to brown penial hooks. Vas deferens passes through a short section of penial sheath before connecting distally to penis. Vagina and free oviduct is short to long, vaginal hooks may be present. Gametolytic duct and sac may not extend as far as albumin gland. Seminal vesicle is present with about the same length from vesicle to talon. Species Perrottetia dermapyrrhosa Up to 2013, all nominal species of Perrottetia were described over a century ago and were often based on brief descriptions with poorly detailed figures. Perrottetia was a poorly known genus with 27 nominal species prior to 2013. Zoologists described several new species of Perrottetia in 2013-2017. Species within the genus Perrottetia include: * Perrottetia aberrata (Souleyet, 1852) * Perrottetia aquilonaria Siriboon & Panha, 2013 * Perrottetia beddomii (Blanford, 1899) * Perrottetia cristatellus (Möllendorff, 1901) * Perrottetia daedaleus (Bavay & Dautzenberg, 1908) * Perrottetia dermapyrrhosa Siriboon & Panha, 2013 * Perrottetia dugasti (Morlet, 1892) * Perrottetia fruhstorferi (Möllendorff) * Perrottetia gregoi Thach, 2018 * Perrottetia gudei (Fulton, 1915) * Perrottetia heudei (Schmacker & Böttger, 1891) * Perrottetia hongthinhae D.-S.

Route N2 national road on Sir Lowry's Pass The line branches from the Bellville–Stellenbosch line at Eerste River, from which it runs through Faure and Firgrove to Somerset West. From Van der Stel station in Somerset West a short line branches to the right to Strand. After leaving Somerset West the line passes through Sir Lowry's Pass Village and climbs Sir Lowry's Pass. At the summit of the pass the line reaches an elevation of ; the summit tunnel is long. The line passes through the fruit- farming area of Elgin before descending the Jakkals River valley to Botrivier. From Botrivier it runs across the Overberg plain through Caledon to a junction at Klipdale. From Klipdale one line continues east to Protem, while another goes south to Bredasdorp. Trains from Cape Town to Bredasdorp (or vice versa) cannot pass directly through the junction at Klipdale, but must first pass around a balloon loop. Bredasdorp is the southernmost railway station in Africa. The line is single-track, and electrified only as far as Strand. Metrorail services of the Northern Line operate from Cape Town through Bellville to Strand; the rest of the line has no regular passenger service. History Class GEA locomotives passing at Steenbras in 1973 The railway arrived at Eerste River in 1862, as part of the construction of the Cape Town–Wellington railway line, the first in the then Cape Colony. A branch to Somerset West opened by the Cape Government Railways on 21 October 1889, and further to Sir Lowry's Pass Village on 1 February 1890. The Hottentots-Holland mountains were a significant obstacle to any further development, and construction of a line over Sir Lowry's Pass only started on 12 July 1899. The effects of the Anglo-Boer War slowed progress, but by 1 August 1902 the line was opened to Caledon.Reported in On 16 December 1905 the short branch to Strand was opened. Two extensions of the line from Caledon were possible: eastwards towards Riviersonderend and Swellendam, with the ultimate possibility of reaching Mossel Bay; or southwards towards Napier and Bredasdorp. In 1906 a conference of delegates from the Overberg was unable to agree on a route for a continuation of the line. Meanwhile, by early 1906 the New Cape Central Railway (NCCR), a private company, had reached Mossel Bay with its line from Worcester via Swellendam, and was having difficulty running it at a profit; this did not bode well for the profitability of a line from Caledon to Swellendam. Construction on an extension began in 1914, reaching Rietpoel on 5 January 1914, Klipdale on 6 April 1914, and Protem on 30 June 1915. This route was a compromise, Klipdale being about halfway between Riviersonderend and Bredasdorp. \\"Protem\\" means \\"for the time being\\", reflecting the intention to continue the line to Swellendam at some time in the future. Ultimately, though, the NCCR was taken over by the South African Railways (SAR) in 1925, making such an extension unnecessary. In the mid-1920s the SAR embarked on a new phase of railway building, as part of which the line from Klipdale junction south to Bredasdorp was opened on 19 April 1924.

In a 1922 review, Bertrand Russell, the co-author of Principia Mathematica, called it \\"undoubtedly the most important work on probability that has appeared for a very long time,\\" and said that the \\"book as a whole is one which it is impossible to praise too highly.\\" The Treatise is fundamentally philosophical in nature despite extensive mathematical formulations. The Treatise presented an approach to probability that was more subject to variation with evidence than the highly quantified classical version. Keynes's conception of probability is that it is a strictly logical relation between evidence and hypothesis, a degree of partial implication. Keynes's Treatise is the classic account of the logical interpretation of probability (or probabilistic logic), a view of probability that has been continued by such later works as Carnap's Logical Foundations of Probability and E.T. Jaynes Probability Theory: The Logic of Science. Keynes saw numerical probabilities as special cases of probability, which did not have to be quantifiable or even comparable. Keynes, in chapter 3 of the TP, used the example of taking an umbrella in case of rain to express the idea of uncertainty that he dealt with by the use of interval estimates in chapters 3, 15, 16, and 17 of the TP. Intervals that overlap are not greater than, less than or equal to each other.

This is a less common type of cruise; in the majority of cruises the ship's final destination is the same as the starting point. Some cruise ships relocate due to change in season (usually during the spring or fall) or economic conditions (a cruise line may relocate a ship when it forecasts demand to be greater in another region). Instead of repositioning an empty ship, cruise lines operate repositioning cruises.

He played at the defensive and offensive tackle positions for the University of Michigan from 1948 to 1951. He was selected as the most valuable defensive tackle in the Big Ten Conference in 1950 and as a first-team All-American at the same position in 1951. He was drafted in the 6th round of the 1952 NFL Draft and became the second African-American to play for the Green Bay Packers in the National Football League. Early years Johnson was born in Chicago in 1931 and raised in Muskegon Heights, Michigan. He attended Muskegon Heights High School where he played football under legendary high school football coach Oscar \\"Okie\\" Johnson. He also played center for the Muskegon Heights basketball team. University of Michigan In 1948, Johnson enrolled at the University of Michigan where he helped work his way through college by washing dishes. He competed in both football and track and field. Johnson was 6 feet, 2 inches tall, and weighed 220 pounds as a football player for the Wolverines. Johnson was a starter at the tackle position for Bennie Oosterbaan's 1949, 1950 and 1951 Michigan Wolverines football teams. As a sophomore in 1949, Johnson started three games at left tackle, sharing the position with College Football Hall of Fame inductee Alvin Wistert. =1950 season= As a junior in 1950, Johnson started all 10 games for Michigan at defensive left tackle and also started 6 games at offensive left tackle. The 1950 team started the season with a record of 2-3-1, but turned the season around with a 20-7 win over Indiana. After the Indiana game, the Associated Press praised Johnson, noting that his \\"work has maintained the same high level whether Michigan rolled or faltered,\\" and further noted that \\"the burly Muskegon Heights tackle\\" was \\"the key man\\" in Michigan's improvement. The AP story continued: > \\"The big 220-pound junior has been a standout against Army, Wisconsin, > Minnesota, Illinois and Indiana. Such backs as the Army's Jack Martin and > Minnesota's Larry Easer, among others, know the surprise of breaking into > the clear only to be dragged down from behind by the cat-quick tackle.\\" The 1950 team finished the regular season with three straight wins to win the Big Ten Conference championship. The Wolverines went on to defeat California 14-6 in the 1951 Rose Bowl. In December 1950, Bernie Swanson, sports editor of the Minneapolis Star, picked Johnson as the best defensive tackle in the Big Ten Conference. =1951 season= As a senior in 1951, Johnson started all 9 games for Michigan at both defensive left tackle and offensive left tackle. At the conclusion of his playing career at Michigan, the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote that Johnson ranked with the greatest ever to play at the tackle position for the Wolverines: > \\"When Tom, known to his teammates as Big Gun, played his final game last > fall he had won a place alongside such great Michigan tackles as Otto > Pommerening, the three Wisterts, Merv Pregulman, and Al Wahl. He was a 60 > minute operator in these days of offensive and defensive platoons. Tom's > intuitive ability, his quickness, and his savvy made his work seem so easy > that his value was appreciated only by experts. He has the gift of doing the > right thing so naturally that he handles blockers and ball carriers in a > completely unspectacular way.\\" In December 1951, Johnson was selected as a first-team defensive tackle on the All-Players All-American team, an All-America team sponsored by the Chicago Tribune and determined based on polling of players in cooperation with the major universities and colleges throughout the United States. The 1951 results were based on a record 18,876 votes. Johnson was also selected as a first-team All-Big Ten tackle by both the Associated Press and United Press. At the end of his senior year, Johnson was also selected to play for the College All-Star team in the annual match against the NFL championship team. While training with the College All-Stars, Chicago Tribune columnist Arch Ward wrote that it would be hard for Michigan coach Bennie Oosterbaan to replace Johnson. Ward added, \\"Tom Johnson, the 60 minute All-American currently assigned to a first string tackle berth in the College All-Star camp, is the acme of modesty.... Hardly a man around can remember him saying anything since the Collegians gathered at St. John's Military academy.\\" =Track and field= In addition to football, Johnson earned two varsity letters at Michigan in track and field. He finished second in the shot put at the 1952 Big Ten Conference indoor track meet. He graduated from Michigan in 1952, receiving a degree in physical education. Professional football Johnson was picked by the Green Bay Packers in the sixth round (63rd overall pick) of the 1952 NFL Draft. When Johnson and Iowa's Donal Riley signed with the Packers, the announcement in the Wisconsin newspapers focused on their race. The Oshkosh Daily Northwestern ran the story under the headline, \\"Packers to Try Out Negro Players.\\" The Capital Times led the story as follows: \\"The signing of two Negro athletes —- Tackle Tom Johnson of Michigan and Fullback Donal (Mike) Riley of Iowa —- was announced today by the Green Bay Packers.\\" Johnson appeared in eight games for the Packers during the 1952 NFL season. He was the second African-American to play for the Packers, following the lead of fellow Michigan Wolverine, Bob Mann, who joined the Packers in 1950.

The black-and-white film was originally shot in 16mm. The film was restored and distributed on DVD by Watchmaker Films in 2006. Plot Frank (Davis) and Loyd (Perryman) spend most of their time drinking, flirting with women (even though Frank is married to Paulette), and thinking of get- rich-quick schemes since they can't seem to hold down jobs. They tried frog farming and squirrel ranching, among other things, and now are in a failing roofing business. Finally, Loyd invents a gadget he calls the \\"Kitchen Wizard,\\" and they each make a thousand dollars selling the rights to a patent attorney who gives them a contract worth much more. However, their idea is stolen and they soon run out of money. Frank contemplates suicide, but Loyd talks him out of it by reminding him of his family and their friendship. Production Sutherland and Pennell raised $43,000 for production of the movie. Estimates for the actual cost of the movie are less than $30,000 as Pennell used part of the movie's budget for his living expenses. Rehearsals began in September 1977, and filming started in early October. The film was shot on location in Austin, Texas.

Information in this article is taken from items in newsletters of the NFAS. History Field archery was introduced to the United Kingdom by US armed forces personnel stationed in the UK during World War II and the subsequent Cold War period. Archers wanting to practice field archery formed clubs such as the Severn Valley Field Archers and the Dunkery Field Bowmen. In 1959 the British Field Archery Association (BFAA) was formed at Dunster in Somerset. The association held annual championships, and defined various rounds shot at unmarked distances in woodland. The BFAA did not require clear lanes between the shooting position and the target - the preference was for the course to be as natural as possible. In 1970 the BFAA merged with the more recently formed English Field Archery Association (EFAA). The EFAA drew its membership largely from areas around US military bases in the UK, and followed the US practice of shooting at marked distances through cleared lanes. The merged organisation followed the EFAA's preferences for marked distances and cleared lanes. Many archers who had been members of the BFAA were dissatisfied with the changes to the character of field archery. In 1972 a group of archers drafted a constitution and a set of rules that enshrined their preferred style of shooting unmarked distances in natural conditions. This led to the formation of the National Field Archery Society, whose first Annual General Meeting took place on the 10th of March 1973 at Clayton Community Centre, Norwood Lane, Clayton, Newcastle, Staffordshire. Current status The NFAS has grown to become the largest field archery organisation in the UK. The NFAS is not affiliated to any international organisation. The NFAS recognises 11 styles of bow: * American Flatbow (AFB) * Barebow (BB) * Bowhunter (BH) * Compound Limited (CL) * Crossbow (XB) * Freestyle (FS) * Hunting Tackle (HT) * Longbow (LB) * Primitive (PV) * Traditional Bowhunter (TB) * Unlimited (UL) The general rules are determined by a committee and ratified or rejected by the membership. Specific rules applying to each bow style are determined by votes cast only by archers who shoot that bow style. Rounds are shot at unmarked distances, predominantly using 2D and 3D animal targets. Two championship events are held every year: * 3D Championships - Bank Holiday weekend, end of May * National Championships - 3rd weekend in September References External links *National Field Archery Society Archery organizations Archery in the United Kingdom 1973 establishments in the United Kingdom Sports organizations established in 1973 Sports organisations of the United Kingdom ","title":"National Field Archery Society"},{"id":"28953420","title":"All About You (album)"},{"id":"28953439","text":"For The Weird By The Weird is the first full-length from American grindcore band Bad Acid Trip.

It occurs most frequently in India and Southeast Asia. Tropical eosinophilia is considered a manifestation of a species of microfilaria. This disease can be confused with tuberculosis, asthma, or coughs related to roundworms. Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia is a rare, but well recognised, syndrome characterised by pulmonary interstitial infiltrates and marked peripheral eosinophilia. This condition is more widely recognised and promptly diagnosed in filariasis-endemic regions, such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Asia and South America. In nonendemic countries, patients are commonly thought to have bronchial asthma. Chronic symptoms may delay the diagnosis by up to five years. Early recognition and treatment with the antifilarial drug, diethylcarbamazine, is important, as delay before treatment may lead to progressive interstitial fibrosis and irreversible impairment. The condition of marked eosinophilia with pulmonary involvement was first termed tropical pulmonary eosinophilia in 1950. The syndrome is caused by a distinct hypersensitive immunological reaction to microfilariae of W. bancrofti and Brugia malayi. However, only a small percentage (< 0.5%) of the 130 million people globally who are infected with filariasis apparently develop this reaction. The clearance of rapidly opsonised microfilariae from the bloodstream results in a hypersensitive immunological process and abnormal recruitment of eosinophils, as reflected by extremely high IgE levels of over 1000 kU/L. The typical patient is a young adult man from the Indian subcontinent. Symptoms A persistent or recurrent cough that gets aggravated at night, weakness, weight loss and a low fever raises the possible diagnosis of this disease. Some children with this disease may also have enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and elsewhere. Others may cough up a little blood and may also have a wheeze. Diagnosis The diagnostic criteria for tropical pulmonary eosinophilia include: *a history supportive of exposure to lymphatic filariasis; *a peripheral eosinophilia count greater than 3 × 109/L); *an elevated serum IgE levels (> 1000 kU/L); *increased titers of antifilarial antibodies; *peripheral blood negative for microfilariae; and *a clinical response to diethylcarbamazine. High antifilarial IgG titers to microfilariae often result in cross reactivity with other nonfilarial helminth antigens, such as strongyloides and schistosoma antigens, as demonstrated in reported cases. It is important to exclude other parasitic infections before tropical pulmonary eosinophilia is diagnosed, by serological tests, examination of stool specimens in a laboratory experienced in parasitic infections, or a trial of anthelmintic medication. Other parasitic infections, such as the zoonotic filariae, dirofilariasis, ascariasis, strongyloides, visceral larva migrans and hookworm disease, may also be confused with tropical pulmonary eosinophilia because of overlapping clinical features, serological profile and response to diethylcarbamazine. Radiological findings are nonspecific, with normal appearance on chest X-ray in up to 20% of patients. Lung biopsy is not part of the routine diagnostic workup of tropical pulmonary eosinophilia.  Treatment  The dramatic response to a commonly used drug for filaria (diethylcarbamazine) almost confirms the diagnosis. No universal treatment guidelines have been established for tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. The antifilarial diethylcarbamazine (6 mg/kg/day in three divided doses for 21 days remains the main therapeutic agent, and is generally well tolerated. Reported side effects include headache, fever, pruritus and gastrointestinal upset. The eosinophil count often falls dramatically within 7–10 days of starting treatment.

Early life Lang was born at Kurnal, India the second son of Edward Tickle Lang and Hebe, the daughter of John Venn Prior. At the age of 1, the family returned to England from the Punjab region of India. Lang's father was a civil servant, who had been working on the Jumna Canal in the Punjab. Education William Lang was educated at Christ's Hospital School, then went to Harrow School in 1894 and Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1898 to read zoology. He graduated with his B.A. in 1902 and M.A. in 1905. Career In 1902 he started as an assistant in the Geology Department of the British Museum (N.H.) in charge of Protozoa, Coelenterates, Sponges and Polyzoa (=Bryozoa). During World War I he was made curator of mosquitos and produced in 1920 \\"A Handbook on British mosquitos\\". After the war he returned to the Geology Department and in 1928 became Keeper of Geology in succession to F. A. Bather. Lang was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1929. His candidacy citation read: \\"Distinguished for his knowledge of palaeontology; has applied evolutionary principles to the systematic arrangement of fossil polyzoa and corals, studying the recapitulation of ancestral characters in the post-embryonic growth-stages of compound as well as simple organisms, e.g., 'Brit Mus Catalogue Fossil Bryozoa' (1921, 1922), 'The Pelmatoporinae'. Lang elucidated in detail the faunal and stratigraphical succession of the Lias along the Dorset coast, with special relation to ammonites. He was a proponent of the theory of orthogenesis, believing that several lineages of cribrimorph cheilostome bryozoans evolved progressively thicker and more elaborate skeletal structures which eventually became maladaptive, driving the lineage to extinction.Anonymous. (1938). Dr. W. D. Lang, F.R.S. Nature 142: 907. By extending the study of existing British species of mosquitoes to their four larval stages, previously ill-known, he tested the relationships already inferred from imaginal characters. Later life Lang mentored many students, who came to use the facilities of the British Museum (N.H.). He retired from the British Museum (N.H.) in 1938 and moved to Charmouth, Dorset, where he had holidayed from an early age. In 1940, Lang, Stanley Smith and H. Dighton Thomas published the \\"Index to palaeozoic coral genera\\". In his retirement Lang wrote several articles about Mary Anning, the fossil collector. He also published on the geology and palaeontology of the Dorset coast around Charmouth. In all, he published over 130 papers. He was president of the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society from 1938 to 1940 and member of its council from 1956 to 1966. He was well liked and respected, and his letters to colleagues and students, including Dorothy Hill, demonstrate the respect and affection with which he and his work was held.  Personal life  Lang married Georgiana Dixon in 1908; they had a son, W. Geoffrey Lang and a daughter, J. Brenda Lang. He died in 1966 and was survived by his wife and children.

Kershaw was also a Southern secessionist and segregationist who helped found the League of the South. In 1998, he sculpted a Nathan Bedford Forrest Statue that has drawn wide criticism and mockery by national media.

He attended Vanderbilt University, where he played on the school football team and graduated with a degree in geology. He was awarded a law degree at the Nashville Y.M.C.A. Night Law School, now known as Nashville School of Law. James Earl Ray case Starting in 1977, Kershaw represented James Earl Ray, who had been sentenced to 99 years in prison for his role in the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Charged with firing the shot that killed Dr. King on April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, Ray had pleaded guilty to the crime in 1969 at the suggestion of his attorney Percy Foreman; Ray would have faced an automatic death sentence had he been convicted of the assassination by a Tennessee state court. Ray claimed that he had been coerced into entering a plea, and Kershaw helped his client push the claim that Ray was not responsible for the shooting, which was said to have been the result of a conspiracy of an otherwise unidentified man named \\"Raul\\" whom Ray had met in Montreal. With the claim that he was \\"partially responsible without knowing it\\" as part of what Ray \\"thought was a gun-smuggling operation\\", Kershaw and his client met with representatives of the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations and convinced the committee to run ballistics tests -- which ultimately proved inconclusive -- that would show that Ray had not fired the fatal shot. Ray was one of a group of five inmates who escaped from Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in June 1977, which Kershaw claimed was additional proof that Ray had been involved in a conspiracy that had provided him with the outside assistance he would have needed to break out of jail. Kershaw convinced Ray to take a polygraph test as part of an interview with Playboy. The magazine said that the test results showed \\"that Ray did, in fact, kill Martin Luther King Jr., and that he did so alone\\". Ray fired Kershaw after discovering that the attorney had been paid $11,000 by the magazine in exchange for the interview, and hired conspiracy theorist Mark Lane to provide him with legal representation. Ray died in prison in 1998. Secessionist and segregationist In 1994, Kershaw was one of the founders of the League of the South, a group that supports Southern secession. He remained a board member until 2009. He was also a past chairman of the League's Cultural and Educational Foundation. Kershaw was previously active in the Nashville chapter of the White Citizens' Council and the Tennessee Federation for Constitutional Government, both segregationist groups.

He developed several sugar plantations in Hawaii, and became a large landholder. Early life Albert Spencer Wilcox was born in Hilo, Hawaii, on May 24, 1844. His father was Abner Wilcox (1808–1869) and mother was Lucy Eliza Hart (1814–1869). His parents were in the eighth company of missionaries to Hawaii for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. His parents taught at the Hilo Mission boarding school founded by David Belden Lyman and his wife. He had three older brothers born while at Hilo. In 1846 the family moved to teach at a similar school at the Waioli Mission near Hanalei, Hawaii, on the northern coast of the island of Kauai. There he had four more brothers, although one died young. In 1851 he sailed to Boston with his father for surgery to fix a birth defect in his foot. He was educated at his parents' school and Punahou School in Honolulu from 1858 to 1862. He worked with his older brother George Norton Wilcox (1839–1933) on the Princeville plantation owned by Robert Crichton Wyllie in the 1860s while living at Waioli. Business Wilcox started a small plantation in Waipā Valley but it failed by 1876. Paul Isenberg installed a sugar mill at Hanamāʻulu in 1877 and hired Wilcox to be its manager. He continued to run the plantation for over two decades. With a reliable source of irrigation, and the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 removing sugar tariffs to the US, he became wealthy. He invested in a mill in the remote western area of Kekaha, to process the sugar grown by Valdemar Knudsen in the 1880s. On February 7, 1883, he incorporated the Inter- Island Steam Navigation Company and served as a director. By 1895 he was able to buy Princeville and turn it into a ranch. He also invested in real estate in Honolulu. Politics Wilcox was elected as a representative from Kauai to the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom from 1887 through 1892. He was involved in drafting the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii, and its forceful imposition which put his brother George into the cabinet of King Kalākaua. On January 14, 1893, he was appointed to the Committee of Safety but resigned at the first meeting to return and take care of business on Kauai. Some of his neighbors from Kauai such as William Owen Smith and Sanford B. Dole played major roles in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Later life and legacy Wilcox married Mary Luahiwa, but they divorced. On June 7, 1898, he married Emma Kauikeolani Napoleon Mahelona (1862–1931), and retired to an estate called Kilohana in Puhi, Hawaii, at . His stepdaughter Ethel Kulamanu Mahelona married his nephew Gaylord Parke Wilcox (1881–1970) and inherited Kilohana. It is the site of one of the heritage railways in Kauai. He built a beach house in Hanalei at directly on the shore of Hanalei Bay near the Hanalei Pier. It was built as a complex of main house, three garages, a boathouse, and separate cottages for gardener, caretaker, and other servants. It later was consolidated into a sprawling single story building with six bedrooms and six bathrooms, with a few remaining cottages. The beach house was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hawaii on July 30, 1993, as Albert Spencer Wilcox Beach House. The Hanalei Land Company, which Wilcox formed in 1903, restored the house and rents it to visitors as accommodations or events such as weddings. It has been kept in the Wilcox family for six generations. Early life Albert Spencer Wilcox was born in Hilo, Hawaii, on May 24, 1844. His father was Abner Wilcox (1808–1869) and mother was Lucy Eliza Hart (1814–1869). His parents were in the eighth company of missionaries to Hawaii for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. His parents taught at the Hilo Mission boarding school founded by David Belden Lyman and his wife. He had three older brothers born while at Hilo.

A property, including five contributing buildings and four other contributing structures, was listed. It was deemed significant architecturally, and for its association with Albert Spencer Wilcox, and for its association with development of Hanalei as a recreation site. Architecturally, it was deemed significant \\"as a good, surviving example of a late nineteenth/early twentieth century house in Hawaii. Its rambling design and separation of social, cooking and sleeping functions into detached rooms connected by a lanai is typical of the period. This house and the Gay residence (Hawaii and National Register of Historic Places) are the only known turn-of-the-century houses on Kauai to retain such a feature. The use of shiplap siding, tongue and groove walls and ceiling, paneled doors, and the quality of workmanship reflect the period of construction. The orientation to the outdoors and the living space provide by the lanais, as well as the numerous windows and openings for light and ventilation, attest to the builder's understanding of the location and the type of lifestyle enjoyed in Hawaii.

Located along Whissler Road north of the unincorporated community of Hallsville, it was established by the family of John Buchwalter in the early years of the nineteenth century. Among the region's earliest settlers, the Buchwalters erected a large log building soon after taking possession of the property. As the years passed, the farm acquired the name of \\"Applethorpe\\" because its grounds included the first apple orchard in Ross County.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1213. By 1840, John Buchwalter, Jr. owned the property; in that year, he decided to construct a new farmhouse. Erecting an elaborate structure in the popular Greek Revival style, he built its two-story walls of brick with sandstone details. The house is generally a very symmetrical structure: the west-facing facade features an entrance in the central of five bays, and twin chimneys rise above each end of the structure., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-09-25. Among its most distinctively Greek Revival elements is the classical portico around the main entrance; it features a triple entablature with square columns, and the doors it shelters are heavy and constructed of multiple large components. In 1983, the Buchwalter house and the rest of Applethorpe Farm were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As well as the house, two agricultural outbuildings qualified as contributing properties within the area designated as historic. Key to the farm's recognition was the architecture of the farmhouse, which was seen as an exceptionally well-preserved example of the rural interpretation of the Greek Revival style.

Henry (born July 30, 1960) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was mayor of Oshawa from 2010 to 2018 and is currently chair of the Regional Municipality of Durham.\\"Outgoing Oshawa mayor John Henry elected Durham regional chair in landslide\\". Toronto Star, October 22, 2018. Background Henry was born in Oshawa. The son of General Motors workers, he attended RS McLaughlin CVI High School. Henry is a graduate of Durham College, George Brown College and Panasonic's Corporate School. Henry trained as an Industrial Fire Fighter at the Louisiana State University, Ice Rescue Specialist at the Rochester Police Academy, Dive Rescue Specialist, Level 1 at the University of Michigan. Henry represented Canada at the First International Dive Rescue Program at the University of Colorado. He is the owner of Office Products and Services, an Oshawa company serving Durham Region and the GTA.  City Councillor  Henry ran for the position of Oshawa councillor Ward 5 in 2003 but was defeated by incumbent Cathy Clarke by 734 votes. He tried again in 2006 this time defeating her by 349 votes. His campaign focused on city hall accountability, developing new sources of revenue and managing spending. In 2007, Oshawa council voted to do away with the ward system that had been in place since 1985. Henry voted to return the election to a system of electing councillors at-large, which had been the historical system from 1933 to 1985. The vote was a result of a referendum held the previous year where a majority of voters preferred the old system. Henry said, \\"I'm not prepared to say people's vote doesn't matter...anything short of supporting this would be an insult to the residents of this city.\\" During his time as councillor, Henry unlike other councillors paid for his municipal expenses out of his own pocket. Mayor of Oshawa In 2010, Henry ran for Mayor of Oshawa. He defeated the incumbent John Gray by 6,295 votes. There was widespread dissatisfaction with Gray's record including his decision to drive a taxpayer funded vehicle, a 2010 Camaro SS and for approving use of city funds to pay MBA education expenses for his executive assistant and another councillor. Due to Henry's expense policy for his election campaign and his previous councillor work he was dubbed \\"Rob Ford East\\" by the Toronto Sun. On September 3, 2013, a raucous council meeting resulted in two members of the public being arrested. The issue being discussed at the meeting was a report by the city's auditor general about a real estate deal. When city security staff tried to deal with them, a struggle ensued. Undercover Durham Regional Police officers who were also sitting in the room then arrested two men and charged them with assault. The charges against them and the security men involved were all withdrawn at a later date. In April 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that reciting the Lord's Prayer in a Quebec municipal council meeting violated that province's Charter of Rights. While several cities outside of Quebec also decided to discontinue the practice, Henry said that it would continue in Oshawa, despite constitutional opinions that said the ruling likely also applied to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Henry said, \\"We ask that people please join in the Lord's Prayer or take a moment of reflection... I am open to debate, but in the meantime at the next council meeting we will continue with the practice.\\" A recent Ontario Ombudsman investigation found Henry had \\"illegal meetings\\", this \\"shameful\\" decision was well documented in all local newspapers like Oshawa this week and Oshawa express.\\"oshawa this week , july 25, 2016 Legal issues On April 25, 2018, Oshawa residents Jeff Davis and former mayoral candidate Lou DeVuono delivered documents to the DRPS downtown station highlighting what they say is evidence of criminal wrongdoing at city hall, particularly in connection to a much maligned land purchase in 2013 for a new city works depot at 199 Wentworth Street East. An initial investigator was given a computer at city hall complete with an F Drive that contained the information and reports that would be relevant to his investigation.

In this challenging volume, we have the powerful words of Peter Grant himself, some of which he preached to his people in the very midst of revival.\\" From the foreword by Scottish professor Donald Meek \\"Peter Grant, the poet, is thus well known, but Peter Grant, the preacher, is a relatively obscure figure, although his skills as an expositor have been remembered in Gaelic tradition, and his ability as a descriptive writer in English can be gauged from his reports to the Baptist Home Missionary Society.

Early life and education Born in London on 6 April 1916, Vickers was educated at Stowe School and Queens' College, Cambridge, where he studied History and English. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain, influenced by the death of his school contemporary, John Cornford, in the Spanish Civil War in 1936. It was here he met fellow Cambridge Communist Party member Winifred 'Freddie' Mary Lambert, later to become his wife. Wartime At the outbreak of war he was called up in 1939, joining the Royal Army Service Corps as 2nd Lieutenant. He was posted to the 5th brigade of the BEF. Whilst on leave in February 1940 he married 'Freddie' Lambert in Cambridge. A few months later, in May 1940, Vickers was wounded and captured shortly before Dunkirk. He subsequently spent five years in Prisoner of War Camps including a period at Stalag XXI-D in Poznań, Poland. Towards the end of the war, as prisoners were moved ahead of the retreating German army, he managed to escape in woods near Kassel and a few days later made contact with an American tank crew. In 1942, Freddie was injured by falling timbers in a bombed house in Cambridge and she subsequently had to have both legs amputated below the knee. James and Freddie were finally reunited at Baker Street tube station. Post-war career In 1946, Vickers was appointed warden of Wedgwood Memorial College where he worked until, in 1949, he was forced to resign following complaints of 'communist bias'. His next job was with the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) research department and he went on to become its education officer. One of his achievements with the ETU was the establishment of Britain's first residential trade union training facility at Esher Place in 1953. During his time with the ETU, he became increasingly disillusioned with the Communist Party and, following the Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, both he and Freddie left the CP, and both joined the Labour Party soon after. In 1960 he became deputy general secretary of the Civil Service Union and became general secretary in 1963. He was influential in the success of the women night cleaners' recognition dispute in 1972. He also served as a member, and from 1975 as chairman, of the staff side of the civil service Whitley Council. He was awarded the OBE in December 1976.

Boudicca sacked London and pushed on to Verulamium (now St. Albans), which was also razed. Suetonius had gathered a large enough army, however, to do battle on the Roman road Watling Street. Boudicca was defeated, and Roman rule was restored to Britain. In Sub-Roman Britain, the Scoti of Ireland raided and colonized the western Scottish and Welsh coastlines. Welsh legend holds that Gwynedd was established by Cunedda Wledig and his family, who invaded from the Old North, variously understood as Pictland or the Romanized tribes around York or Hadrian's Wall. = Germanic invasions = As the Roman Empire declined, its hold on Britain loosened.

The peoples now called the 'Anglo-Saxons' largely came from Jutland and northern Germany, first landing in Eastern Britain. There are few records existing that account this migration, and those that were written come mainly from the Mediterranean area or were created long after the event. There were a small number of Anglo- Saxons already living in Britain before the Roman withdrawal in AD 408. The majority of these served in the army and helped the Romans fight Saxon pirates who raided the southern and eastern coasts of Britain from the 3rd century onwards. Following the collapse of Roman rule, the British rulers seemed to have hired the Saxons as mercenaries to counter the threat of invasions from the Picts in the first half of the fifth century. The Picts became less of a threat, but the mercenaries stayed and, realising their strength, rebelled. This encouraged the sea borne migration that subsequently followed and continued into the 6th century.Falkus, Malcolm. \\"Historical atlas of Britain\\". Book club associates London, 1980, p. 30.

William was crowned in London by the Archbishop of York, then set about restructuring the English government and imposing the feudal system on the nobility.  The Danish invasion of 1069–70  William's rule was not yet secure and a number of revolts against the Normans took place, notably in the North of England and East Anglia. A large Danish army arrived in England in 1069 to support an uprising in the North. In the winter of the same year William marched his army from Nottingham to York with the intention of engaging the rebel army. However, by the time William's army had reached York the rebel army had fled. As the Danes had nowhere suitable to stay for the winter, on land, they decided to go back to their ships in the Humber Estuary. They were reinforced in 1070 by a fleet from Denmark and sailed en-masse to East Anglia where they raided the area.

John continued the war against King Philip II of France, whose forces overran much of the English territory in France, including Normandy. After John's second attempt to invade France failed, his nobles forced him to agree to the Magna Carta in 1215. However, the king disregarded the charter's contents, and the barons rose up against him and appealed to the heir to the French throne, the future Louis VIII, to replace John as king. The first French troops arrived in November 1215, with 240 knights and a similar number of infantry following in January 1216.Longmate (1990), pp. 262–265 In May 1216 Louis himself arrived with his army and moved quickly to capture London. There was little resistance when the prince entered London and at St Paul's Cathedral, Louis was proclaimed King with great pomp and celebration in the presence of all of London. Even though he was not crowned, many nobles, as well as King Alexander II of Scotland (1214–1249), gathered to give homage.

Invasions of Wales (793–1284) Shortly after their conquest of England in 1066, the Normans invaded Wales. Although, the Welsh reversed much of the Normans' initial advance, the Marcher lords continued to occupy significant parts of the country. By the 13th century the Welsh principality of Gwynedd posed a significant threat both to the Marcher lords and to the King of England. Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, prince of Gwynedd, secured the recognition of the title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. Later however, a succession of disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn's wife Eleanor, daughter of Simon de Montfort, culminated in the first invasion by Edward I. As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn's fealty to England in 1277. Peace was short lived and, with the completion in 1282 of the Edwardian conquest, the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn's death and his brother prince Dafydd's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage for their lands to Edward I.  Invasions of England and Wales (1284–1797)  = Scottish Wars = Anglo-Scottish relations were generally poor throughout the Late Middle Ages. Edward I's attempts to become feudal overlord of Scotland after the death of Alexander III in 1286 led to a long struggle for Scottish independence. Significantly, in 1295 it led to a long running alliance with France, later known as the Auld alliance.Macdougall (2001), pp. 15–25 Warfare between the English and the French would therefore provide a strategic context of many of the major Scottish invasions of England, in particular in 1346, 1385 and 1513.Macdougall (2001), pp. 40–41, 49–51, 116–18 French troops were also involved in the Scottish invasion of England in 1464, during the Wars of the Roses.

Taking advantage of the political crisis caused by this incident, the French king, whose nation was at war with the English king, Henry VIII, convinced James IV of Scotland to invade his southern neighbour. Since King Henry was in France campaigning, Queen Catherine of Aragon organized an English army and placed it under the command of the elderly Earl of Surrey. The army marched north and met James' forces at Flodden. James surprised the English by leading his centre in a wild charge against Surrey's, but the English stood fast and repulsed the Scots, unhorsing and killing James. The battle ended in an English victory. = The Hundred Years' War = Franco-Castilian raids on the English coast 1374–80There were numerous French raids on the English coast during the Hundred Years' War. Few of these had the scale, or purpose, of invasions. Perhaps the closest was the overrunning of the Isle of Wight by a French fleet commanded by Jean de Vienne in August 1377.Longmate (1990), p. 337 Some more significant French operations do warrant mention, however.

In 1339 the French returned, allegedly with 8000 men in 17 Genoese galleys and 35 French ships. Again they failed to take the castle and, after causing damage, withdrew. The English were able to recapture Guernsey in October 1340 but the French held out in Castle Cornet until 1345.Ford (2004), p. 22 In July 1373, Bertrand du Guesclin overran Jersey and besieged Mont Orgueil. His troops succeeded in breaching the outer defences, forcing the garrison back to the keep. The garrison came to an agreement that they would surrender if not relieved by Michaelmas and du Guesclin sailed back to Brittany, leaving a small force to carry on the siege. Fortunately for the defenders, an English relief fleet arrived in time.Ford (2004), p. 23 The French did not succeed in capturing Jersey during the Hundred Years' War, but did capture Mont Orgueil in the summer of 1461, allegedly as part of a secret deal between Margaret of Anjou and Pierre de Brézé to gain French support for the Lancastrian cause. The island was held by the French until 1468, when Yorkist forces and local militia were able to recapture the castle.Watts (2004), pp. 16–17  The invasion threat of 1386  From December 1385, Charles VI of France began to prepare for an invasion of England, assembling ships in the Low Countries and Brittany.Longmate (1990), p. 343 Preparations continued all through the spring and summer of 1386, with the assembly of large quantities of stores, equipment and men. Amongst the stores assembled was a large prefabricated wooden fort, 3000 paces long, with walls 20 ft (6m) high.Longmate (1990), p. 344 The English responded by raising forces of men-at-arms and archers, who were stationed on the coast from the Humber to Cornwall. Originally intending to attack in August, Charles put back the date to October, and early in the month joined his fleet in Flanders. However, he was persuaded by his admiral, the Duke of Berry, to postpone the attack to the following year. A smaller-scale expedition was planned for the summer of 1387 but it came to nothing.Longmate (1990), pp. 348–49  The French Invasion of 1405  In July 1404, Owain Glyn Dwr signed a treaty with the French by which they recognised him as Prince of Wales.Davies (1997), pp. 192–93 This led to a French expeditionary force landing in South Wales in February 1405 to support Glyn Dwr's forces. In August these were reinforced by a further expedition of 2500 men. The combined army campaigned in Pembrokeshire, destroying Haverfordwest and capturing Carmarthen.Davies (1997), p. 194 According to the French historian Monstrelet, they then invaded England and for eight days faced the English army of Henry IV at Woodbury Hill. No battle however occurred and the Franco-Welsh force returned to Wales. Although some of the French returned home in November, most overwintered. Attempts were made to bring French reinforcements in 1406 but these were intercepted by the English fleet. The remaining French troops were withdrawn sometime during the year.Davies (1997), p. 195 = The overthrow of Richard II, 1399 = In October 1398, Henry Bolingbroke was exiled for ten years by Richard II. In February 1399, Henry's father, John of Gaunt, died, and in March 1399, Richard declared that Henry's inheritance was forfeit and that he was a traitor, permanently banished from the realm.Mortimer (2007), pp. 159–64 Then, in what was to prove a major strategic error, Richard proceeded with his army to Ireland. This gave Henry the opportunity to return to England and, on 4 July 1399, he landed with a small force at Ravenspur.Mortimer (2007), p. 171 From there, he marched into the Lancastrian heartlands of Yorkshire, building his forces. At Bridlington, he was joined by the Earl of Northumberland and his son Henry Percy. The army marched southwards and on 20 July reached Leicester. Meanwhile, Richard's regent, Edmund, Duke of York had raised an army and was in Hertfordshire. The Duke of York had little desire to fight, however, and detaching himself from the army, met Henry at Berkeley Castle on 27 July. Henry then marched his army to Bristol, where Richard's major supporters had gathered to await his return from Ireland. The castle rapidly surrendered and Richard's chief counselors were promptly executed.Mortimer (2007), p. 176 In the meantime, Richard had returned from Ireland, landing in Milford Haven in South Wales. However, fearing a plot, he abandoned his army and fled to North Wales, where he had stronger support. However, support was not forthcoming and at the beginning of August, Henry and his army were at Chester while Richard with a few men held Conway Castle. Henry sent a force under the Earl of Northumberland to capture Richard, which they did by a trick on 15 August.Mortimer (2007), pp. 177–79 Richard was taken to London and on 29 September was forced to abdicate. On 30 September Henry was proclaimed king at Westminster Hall, the first of the Lancastrian kings.Mortimer (2007), pp. 186–93 = The Wars of the Roses = England was spared invasion during the Hundred Years' War against France and Castile, but it was plagued by 32 years (1455–1487) of civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses. The Lancastrian branch of the House of Plantagenet, which had overthrown the direct royal line in 1399, was embroiled in fighting against the Yorkist wing of the dynasty. The Lancastrian king, Henry VI, was deposed twice during the wars and was murdered after the second deposition. He was replaced by the Yorkist claimant, Edward IV, who ruled until his death. He was succeeded by his young son, Edward V, who, along with his brother, was placed in the Tower of London,The Battle of Bosworth . Wars-of-the-roses.com.

The main benefactor of Edward's disappearance was the boys' regent and uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who was then crowned king. In exile in Brittany, Henry Tudor, a distant relation of the Lancastrians, gathered a small, mainly mercenary army and mounted an invasion of Wales in 1485. Welshmen, Lancastrians, and disaffected Yorkists rallied behind Tudor, whose forces encountered Richard and the royal army at Bosworth Field on August 22. Richard was killed during the fighting, and his forces lost the battle. Tudor was crowned king as Henry VII, and, after defeating Yorkist rebels in 1487, established the House of Tudor as the sole English ruling dynasty. = Perkin Warbeck = The pretender Perkin Warbeck made three attempts to invade England. The first, on 3 July 1495, occurred at Deal. Warbeck had arrived on a fleet of ships provided by Maximillian I. An advanced force of supporters and Flemish mercenaries was put ashore to attempt to raise local rebellion. Local forces however, defeated the landing party, killing 150 and capturing 163.Gunn (2004) Warbeck himself did not land. The second invasion came in September 1496. Warbeck had been received in Scotland in January 1496 and James IV supported him in an invasion of England later in the year. Unfortunately for the invaders, there was again no local support for Warbeck and the invaders soon returned across the border. The third, and most successful, invasion took place in Cornwall in September 1497. In May and June 1497, there had been a revolt against Henry VII in Cornwall. This had been suppressed following the rebels' defeat at Blackheath. However, there was still sufficient dissatisfaction that when Warbeck arrived with a small force, he was accepted by many locals as Richard IV and soon raised a force of up to 8,000 rebels. With this army, he besieged Exeter. The fighting, over two days, was bloody, with the rebels making assaults on North and East gates. One or both gates were penetrated but the attackers were driven out after fierce street fighting. 300–400 rebels are alleged to have been killed during the attack.The assault on Exeter With the failure of the attack, the rebel army withdrew to Taunton. By this time, however, a royal army was approaching and the morale of the rebels began to crack. Warbeck fled on 21 September but was captured at Beaulieu Abbey in Hampshire. = The Battle of Cornwall of 1595 = = The Raid on the Medway= The Raid on the Medway, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War in June 1667, was a successful attack conducted by the Dutch navy on English battleships at a time when most were virtually unmanned and unarmed, laid up in the fleet anchorages off Chatham Dockyard and Gillingham in the county of Kent. At the time, the fortress of Upnor Castle and a barrier chain called the \\"Gillingham Line\\" were supposed to protect the English ships. The Dutch, under nominal command of Willem Joseph van Ghent and Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, over several days bombarded and captured the town of Sheerness, sailed up the Thames estuary to Gravesend, then sailed into the River Medway to Chatham and Gillingham, where they engaged fortifications with cannon fire, burned or captured three capital ships and ten more ships of the line, and captured and towed away the flagship of the English fleet, HMS Royal Charles. = The Glorious Revolution = In 1688 the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange-Nassau landed an army in Devon at the invitation of a group of Protestant nobles who were dissatisfied with what they perceived as the absolutist tendencies of the reigning Catholic King James II. After a brief campaign culminating in the Battle of Reading, William's army successfully forced James into exile in France. After securing French military backing, James attempted to re-invade by mustering troops in Ireland, but was defeated decisively at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. After Parliament legitimized William's invasion it became known as the Glorious Revolution. It was the last successful invasion of the British Isles to date. = The Battle of Fishguard of 1797 = Invasions of Ireland = Norman invasions 1169–72 = = Scottish Invasion of 1315–18 = Invasions of Scotland = Viking raids and invasions = While there are few records, the Vikings are thought to have led their first raids in Scotland on the holy island of Iona in 794, the year following the raid on the other holy island of Lindisfarne, Northumbria. In 839, a large Norse fleet invaded via the River Tay and River Earn, both of which were highly navigable, and reached into the heart of the Pictish kingdom of Fortriu. They defeated Eogán mac Óengusa, king of the Picts, his brother Bran and the king of the Scots of Dál Riata, Áed mac Boanta, along with many members of the Pictish aristocracy in battle. The sophisticated kingdom that had been built fell apart, as did the Pictish leadership, which had been stable for more than a hundred years since the time of Óengus mac Fergusa. The accession of Cináed mac Ailpín as king of both Picts and Scots can be attributed to the aftermath of this event. = The Wars of Independence = Following the disputed succession of the Scottish crown on the death of Alexander III, Edward I led an English invasion in 1296, sacking Berwick upon Tweed and subjugating Scotland.

In 1332, Edward III of England supported the claims of Edward Balliol to the Scottish throne. Balliol led an invasion, and following his success at Dupplin Moor, Edward III also moved north. By 1333, much of Scotland was under English occupation, with eight of the Scottish lowland counties being ceded to England by Edward Balliol. In 1334, Edward III invaded again, but he accomplished little and retreated in February 1335 having failed to bring the Scots to battle. He and Edward Balliol returned again in July with an army of 13,000, and advanced through Scotland, first to Glasgow and then Perth, where Edward III installed himself as his army looted and destroyed the surrounding countryside. In May 1336 an English army under Henry of Lancaster invaded, followed in July by another army under King Edward. Together, they ravaged much of the north-east and sacked Elgin and Aberdeen, while a third army ravaged the south-west and the Clyde valley. Philip VI of France announced that he intended to aid the Scots by invading England, prompting Edward's retreat. By late 1336, the Scots had regained control over virtually all of Scotland. Although the war continued until the Treaty of Berwick in 1357, the English did not return to Scotland. = The Rough Wooing = In 1542 the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, acceded to the Scottish throne. Henry VIII of England sought a dynastic marriage between Mary and his son Edward. An initial proposal was agreed, but due to internal divisions between pro-France and pro-English factions, the Scots rescinded the agreement. War broke out and the English army sacked Edinburgh in May 1544. The battle of Ancrum Moor the following year led to the English withdrawal. After Henry's death and the installation of Protector Somerset, the English returned, defeating the Scots at the battle of Pinkie in September 1547. They established a base at Haddington and put much of southern Scotland under military rule. In response, the Scots requested aid from the French, and French troops arrived at Leith in 1548. The Treaty of Norham ended hostilities in 1551, although the French remained until the Siege of Leith in 1560, when they were ejected by combined Protestant Scottish and English forces. This latter period of the conflict is sometimes referred to as a proxy war, fought by Scottish factions on behalf of France and England.

Based on the Pokémon franchise, the storyline takes place several years after the events of the original anime series. Intended as a fan-response to \\"the common trend of 'dark and gritty' reboots of popular franchises\\", the film was meant to give a mature spin on Pokémon and be in the same vein as work seen on parody website CollegeHumor. The creators initially intended to reveal the film at the Vancouver Anime Evolution convention, it was not shown due to technical difficulties. Instead on September 14, 2010, it revealed online via a teaser segment distributed through emails sent to various media outlets, which presented itself as a recording of a \\"secret movie trailer screening\\" for a film in development. The full film followed shortly thereafter, posted online on September 20. The result of almost two years of work, the film follows Ash Ketchum and his friends years after the events of the original anime series, and their struggle against criminal organization Rocket Industries. Deciding on using the subject of Pokémon after considering several possibilities such as Grand Theft Auto and Dragon Ball Z, the producers were surprised by fan reaction to the material. Despite praises for the content, they have stated they have no intention to produce a full-fledged film. The initial \\"leaked\\" preview was met with skepticism and criticism, with Crave Online in particular recalling the trend of past video game-inspired films being of poor quality. Kotaku and Topless Robot in particular noting that the preview did it a disservice by hiding the charm of the completed project, which by comparison was met with very positive reception. GamesRadar called it \\"amazing\\", and stated that the content was \\"good enough for grown ups\\"; in a further discussion, they added they were impressed by the quality of the work, and how it addressed the similarity between the games and dog fighting. Other sources such as The Escapist and Game Informer also heavily praised the production, with the former lamenting that such a concept would never officially appear from Nintendo. Synopsis Structured as a trailer for a non-existent film, Pokémon Apokélypse is set in the fictional Celadon City, and takes place several years after the events of the original anime series. The plot focuses on Ash Ketchum (Lee Majdoub), a Pokémon Trainer who commands creatures called Pokémon to battle other Trainers' Pokémon to advance within a league setting. Formerly a global sport, it was long since outlawed due to outcries of animal abuse, and instead continued in underground arenas, where the fighting became much more brutal. Despite warnings by his friend Brock (Kial Natale), Ash takes part in the battles with his Pokémon, Pikachu. When approached by Giovanni (David Quast), the head of Rocket Industries, with a bribe to throw his next fight, Ash turns the offer down. In response, Giovanni threatens Ash's former mentor Professor Oak (Richard Toews) and girlfriend, Misty (Rebecca Strom). Deciding to keep them safe, Ash accepts the bribe, and Pikachu is nearly killed in the match. Quickly regretting his actions, Ash revisits Giovanni and returns the bribe money, declaring himself out of the league. Enraged, Giovanni declares Ash and his friends dead, and sends his minions Jessie, James (Julia Lawton and Gharret Patrick Paon) and Meowth to carry out the retribution. As a result, Oak is killed, Pikachu and Misty are assaulted, and Brock is tortured. With the help of Pikachu, Brock and Misty, Ash goes after Giovanni and aims to take down Rocket Industries (including Mewtwo), declaring he will not stop until he has \\"caught them all\\".  Cast  * Lee Majdoub as Ash Ketchum * Ikue Ōtani as Pikachu (voice clips) * Kial Natale as Brock * Rebecca Strom as Misty * Julia Lawton as Jessie * Gharrett Patrick Paon as James * David Quast as Giovanni * Richard Toews as Professor Oak * Sahaj Malhotra as Nurse Joy * Katherine Atkinson as Officer Jenny * Jason Lee Fraser as Team Rocket Grunt * Tanner McColman as Team Rocket Grunt * Taylor Enobuc James as Team Rocket Grunt * Derek Cheng as Team Rocket Grunt Development and production Produced as a side project by Kial Natale, Dylan Innes and Lee Majdoub, the concept originated in December 2008 from the desire to produce a live-action version of a series, with Natale wishing to focus on Grand Theft Auto, and Majdoub suggesting a film based upon Dragon Ball Z. After another member of the group suggested Pokémon as a possibility, they focused on that concept instead. Kial quickly wrote a script for the short film, while Majdoub and executive film producer Innes contributed additional material to flesh it out. Originally intended to be a film in the vein of CollegeHumor's parody productions, more scenes were added and visual effects improved due to Kial's love for the series and his desire for the film to be \\"more and more\\". Planning of the film took four months, while filming and production took a year and a half. Varying crew sizes were used for the four different filming periods with the majority of filming occurring within one weekend. Majdoub noted he was surprised at the number of people that came forth for auditions that were not actors, but fans of the series. The film's tone was inspired by a discussion with editor Nicholas Porteous about a review of Ang Lee's film Hulk, in which a producer theorized that the film was seen as a commercial failure \\"because it wasn’t dark and gritty, like Batman Begins\\". Natale found the idea that Begins succeeded solely due to its tone insulting to its director Christopher Nolan, and joked with Majdoub on the popularity of 'dark' series reboots, pondering what series would be good for a live-action adaptation. Settling on Pokémon due to its undertones of animal rights abuse, Majdoub wanted to approach the film from a completely mature standpoint. Displeased with the current trend of video game to film adaptations, they wished to \\"see how far we could take it without being absolutely ridiculous\\". A variety of locations were worked in to give the completed project a proper trailer feel. The title Pokémon Apokélypse was chosen as nod to Apocalypse Now, due to the similarity of the shooting ratios, with only ten percent of the footage actually used. Though several scenes were shot to add more content to the film, others using dialogue and one-liners from the anime series were purposefully shot in longer scenes then cropped down, in order to ensure the lines did not feel forced and to give a sense that \\"here is a world beyond what is shown in the trailer\\". Though originally intended to be shown at the Anime Evolution convention in Vancouver, Canada, the crew ran into technical difficulties. At a friend's suggestion, the film was instead revealed through viral emails on September 14, 2010, with the sender named \\"Professor Oak\\" attaching a small thirty-second part of the film and presenting it as a small part recorded from a \\"secret movie trailer screening\\". Satisfied that the teaser had sparked interest, the full film was released on September 20. Natale stated that he was impressed by the people that had scrutinized the preview to determine whether or not it was genuine. When asked if they had any plans to produce a full movie, Majdoub stated that he would like to consider the prospects if they could receive assistance with the CGI aspects of the film, however any further production would be up to Natale. Natale in turn added that while he was grateful for the positive reviews, he had no intention to do further films based on the Pokémon franchise. Critical reception =Initial reaction= Reaction to the film's preview segment was mixed. Kotaku heavily praised the effects, undertone and music, stating that the staff loved it, though lamented that an official film of this kind would join a long line of \\"ill-advised live-action adaptations\\". Game Informer called it \\"absurd\\", stating that while it was a possible proof of concept film it was more likely completely fake, and adding \\"It looks goofy as hell, and Pokéfans are sure to get a couple chuckles out of it if nothing else.\\" ComicsAlliance called it \\"somewhere in the middle\\" of presenting a better take on the franchise and a reminder that \\"some intellectual properties got things right (or inherently wrong) the first time\\", though called the effect \\"surprisingly competent\\" and it both generally fun and funny. Crave Online heavily criticized the film, calling the story formulaic and the production values \\"threadbare\\", and further adding that they dreaded the idea of it inspiring an actual live-action film on the series in light of Capcom's Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li. =Post-release= In contrast, the full film has been well received by the media. GamesRadar praised the idea of the film, stating that if produced it would be \\"the best movie since Piranha 3D\\" and calling it \\"good enough for grown-ups\\". In a further discussion via their Pokémon Monday cast, the three editors involved praised the film as \\"very well done\\". While one editor stated disdain for the appearance of the various Pokémon in the film, they agreed that in any live- action adaptation the creatures would \\"always look weird\\", and that for a film with a lack of budget they were done very well. They also praised the attention of detail, and praised David Quast's portrayal of Giovanni, as well as the presentation of recurring anime villains Jessie, James and Meowth. Editor Carolyn Gudmundson added that she was uncomfortable with the grittiness of the production, though praised it for presenting out the inherent problem of the concept behind the games and its similarity to dog fighting. The Escapist shared similar sentiments, calling the film \\"amazing\\" and stating their desire to see the mock-trailer expanded into a full film despite it being contrary to Nintendo's vision of the series; \\"Why can't anything this cool ever come through official channels?\\" Joystiq commented that it was \\"long, long overdue\\" and called the completed results delightful, questioning why such a project had not been properly attempted years prior. Kotaku added that while the \\"leaked\\" segment hid the flaws in the film's effects, it hurt the film by hiding the \\"hammy charm\\" of the completed project. Though Game Informer criticized the original segment, they heavily praised the full film, describing it as \\"what the franchise could look like if Peter Jackson, Martin Scorsese, and Jerry Bruckheimer all teamed up\\". Topless Robot stated that while the original preview had nearly sabotaged the final production's appeal, they called it \\"awesome\\" and described it as taking \\"Pokémon battles to its inevitable, cock-fighting end\\". Cinemablend stated that while the content was out of place with Nintendo's presentation of the series, they found the finished product still \\"pretty cool\\", further praising the effects and the approach taken towards the material.

He earned the award for rescuing injured shipmates despite hazardous conditions following a 1905 boiler explosion aboard his ship, . Biography Born in Copenhagen in 1867, Fredericksen immigrated to the United States at age 17. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1897 and served on more than 20 ships in roles such as boilermaker, fireman and quartermaster. He was stationed aboard the gunboat as a watertender, a position which required him to tend the fires and boilers in the ship's engine room. On July 21, 1905, Bennington was off San Diego, California, when a boiler exploded, killing 66 and seriously wounding 46 of the 179 men aboard. In the immediate aftermath, Fredericksen \\"[w]as prominent in the work of rescuing the injured from confined spaces below decks\\" despite those areas being \\"filled with blinding steam and the decks covered with scalding water; and while the ship was heavily listed, rapidly filling, and thought liable to sink at any moment.\\" Eleven sailors, including Fredericksen, were awarded the Medal of Honor on January 5, 1906, for their efforts to save their crewmates and the ship. Fredericksen served on active duty in the U.S. Navy until 1925 and in the Naval Reserve until 1930, reaching the rank of chief watertender. After leaving active duty, he lived in Keyport, Washington, and worked for the Howard S. Wright & Co. construction company in nearby Bremerton. In 1944 he moved to Seattle and died of natural causes at the U.S. Marine Hospital in 1950. Fredericksen had no known next of kin and was buried at Seattle's Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park without ceremony and with only a temporary grave marker. The location of his grave was lost to history until 2016, when a researcher with the Medal of Honor Historical Society tracked him through pension records and re-discovered his burial place.

It is a common, wiry shrub with tiny leaves that are often obscured by the flowers, especially near the ends of the stems. The plant sometimes grows in dense groups, giving the effect of a snowfall. Description Coral heath is an erect, wiry shrub with rod-like stems and angled branches, usually growing to a height of . The leaves are about long and wide, concave and egg-shaped to almost circular and sharply pointed but not prickly.Les Robinson - Field Guide to the Native Plants of Sydney, page 107 The flowers are arranged singly in the axils of as many as 90 of the upper leaves, often almost covering of the ends of the branches. The petals form a tube with spreading lobes long and are white with five red anthers visible in the centre. Flowers are present for most of the year, but the main flowering period is July to November. Epacris microphylla flowers Taxonomy and naming Epacris microphylla was first formally described by Robert Brown in 1810 and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. The specific epithet (microphylla) is derived from the Ancient Greek words mikros meaning \\"small\\" or \\"little\\" and phyllon meaning \\"leaf\\". There are two varieties of E. microphylla: * Epacris microphylla var. microphylla which is an open straggly shrub with few main stems and which flowers mainly from July to October; * Epacris microphylla var. rhombifolia, or mountain coral heath, which is an erect shrub with several stems and which flowers from November to early March. It is classed as a distinct species (Epacris rhombifolia) in New South Wales and Victoria. Distribution and habitat Coral heath grows in heathland in moist, rocky areas and in forest areas. It occurs in coastal areas in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, often in poor, sandy soils. It is also only known in a single locality in New Zealand, on the southern shore of the Manukau Harbour, near Auckland. Use in horticulture Epacris microphylla is an attractive and hardy garden plant as long as it is grown in well-drained soil. It is difficult to propagate from seed but can be grown from semi-hard tip cuttings.

Douglas Keith, FAAAS (born Harvey Douglas Keith, 10 March 1927, Belfast, Northern Ireland – died 9 February 2003) was a physicist and one of the primary polymer researchers over the latter half of the 20th century. Early UK University affiliations In 1948, Keith obtained a BSc degree from Queen's University in Belfast. In 1951, he received a PhD in Physics from the University of Bristol in England, where he taught optics as a lecturer in Physics between 1951 and 1956. Industrial career Keith immigrated to the United States in 1956 after accepting a position at the American Viscose Corporation in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, where he began researching the complex structures and morphologies of macromolecules. There, he met his lifelong collaborator, Frank J. Padden Jr. Together, they began to examine the optical properties of spherulites from both theoretical and experimental approaches (see Spherulite). Keith and Padden joined Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, NJ in 1960. Not long after they arrived, they published a seminal paper on spherulitic crystallisation. They subsequently studied the crystalline structures of isotactic polypropylene, isotactic polystyrene, polyesters, various polypeptides (see Peptide), and other crystallisable polymers. In 1965, Keith and his collaborators explained the mechanical strength of polymers by discovering their intercrystalline links. A team led by Keith led, including Padden, Lotz and Giannoni, produced the first chain-folded single DNA crystals in 1969. For this and their later work, the American Physical Society awarded its Polymer Physics Prize to Keith & Padden in 1973. Later, he was named Head of the Analytical Chemistry Research Department at AT&T; Bell Laboratories. He subsequently became Head of the Organic Materials Research Department. The Keith and Padden theory Forming the basis of what has become known as the Keith and Padden theory, the two researchers published \\"Twisting orientation and the role of transient states in polymer crystallization\\" in 1984 and \\"Banding in Polyethylene and other spherulites\\" in 1996. These two papers addressed the long-standing problem of accounting for the origins of lamellar twisting in banded polymer spherulites. Later academic research After his retirement from Bell Labs in 1988, Keith continued his polymer morphology research as a faculty member at the University of Connecticut. He became a Professor Emeritus in 1996. Affiliations/honours Keith was active as a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS). In 1965–1966, he chaired the Polymer Physics Division, and in 1977–1985 served as the Divisional Councilor at the APS Council. He was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). In 1986, he was the Fraser Price Lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He served on the Editorial Advisory Boards of two research journals, Macromolecules and the Journal of Polymer Science Part B. Death On 9 February 2003, Keith died from cancer at his home in South Windsor, Connecticut, aged 75.

The test gives a positive result in amino acids carrying aromatic groups, especially in the presence of tyrosine. If the test is positive the proof is neutralized with an alkali, turning dark yellow. The yellow colour is due to xanthoproteic acid which is formed due to nitration of certain amino acids, most common examples being tyrosine and tryptophan. This chemical reaction is a qualitative test, determining the presence or absence of proteins. Reaction of nitration of tyrosine as an example xanthoproteic reaction  Procedure  Add 1 ml of concentrated HNO3 to 1 ml of the test sample. Heat the mixture and cool it. Slowly add sodium hydroxide (40% w/v in water) solution until the mixture becomes alkaline and a colour change is noted. If the colour changes from yellow to orange, this indicates the presence of an aromatic amino acid. When you drop nitric acid on your skin or nails, it turns yellow after some time, indicating the presence of protein. The finger nails show a bright yellow colour (finger nails are made up of keratin- a protein) which cannot be scraped off, unlike the yellow colouration on the skin which can be peeled off.

The District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 21, 2006.National Register of Historic Places List of Actions Taken on Properties 6/19/06 through 6/23/06 web page. Over 40 contributing properties, including two buildings that are also in the National Register for their own significance, are included in the list. Most information was retrieved from two major sources: Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana's Blackford County Interim Report (Interim Report) and the National Register of Historic Places Nomination form for the Hartford City Courthouse Square District (National Register). The National Register was the final source to decide which properties contribute to the historic district. There are some instances where the sources disagree. For example, the Interim Report listed all of the monuments on the courthouse lawn as contributing properties, while National Register listed only the World War I monument. Any additional sources, which were used exclusively in the notes column with one exception, are footnoted.The Cox Building was described as \\"Commercial Building\\" in both major sources, but additional sources provided enough information to identify the building by name. The list contains information on each property, including its common name. If the building doesn't have a common name that can be attributed to a reliable source, then it is described simply as a \\"Commercial Building\\". The address is listed for each structure because it provides a general reference point to navigate the properties of the historic district. Some addresses may change slightly over time as storefronts are altered. Where the two major sources disagree on a street address, the current address of the building was used. Four of the categories of information can be sorted. The list's default sort orders the properties alphabetically by street, and then north-to-south or east-to-west. Linked information on each building's major architectural themes is also listed where available. Images and brief notes, where available, are listed in the last section.  Contributing properties  These properties are contributing properties to the Hartford City Courthouse Square Historic District. In general this means that they add to the historic character of the historic district. In the case of this historic district, the property is associated with architecture, commerce, politics, government, or social history. {| style=\\"width:98%\\" ! ! width = 18% Property name ! width = 18% Address ! width = 7% Built ! width = 18% Architecture ! width = 8% class=\\"unsortable\\" Image ! class=\\"unsortable\\" Notes |-- ! 1 Blackford County Courthouse Courthouse Square 1894 Romanesque Revival Richardsonian Romanesque 100px Focal point of town.

FHEO is responsible for administering and enforcing federal fair housing laws and establishing policies that make sure all Americans have equal access to the housing of their choice. Mission The mission of FHEO is to create equal housing opportunities for all persons living in America by administering laws that prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, and familial status.http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/aboutfheo/aboutfheo History President Johnson signing the Civil Rights Act of 1968 The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity was created by the Fair Housing Act of 1968 which sought to end discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, color, religion, and national origin. The passage of the Act was contentious. The Fair Housing Act was meant to be a direct follow up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, however from 1966 to 1967 Congress failed to garner enough political support for its passage. At that time several states had passed their own fair housing laws and Congress was not convinced that a federal law was necessary. It was only after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, and the ensuing riots, that Congress finally passed the bill. It was signed into law on April 11, 1968, by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson, who was one of the Act’s strongest supporters, called the new law one of the \\"promises of a century... it proclaims that fair housing for all—all human beings who live in this country—is now a part of the American way of life.\\" Since 1968, the Fair Housing Act has been amended twice. In 1974 sex was added as a protected basis. In 1988 the Act was amended again to expand the number of protected bases and correct some of the enforcement inadequacies of the original Act. Congress changed the Fair Housing Act to include protection for persons with disabilities and prohibit discrimination based on familial status. The amendment strengthened the enforcement provisions by allowing the aggrieved parties to seek remedy for their cases before a HUD Administrative Law Judge or in federal court. In addition, the amendment granted the Department of Justice the power to impose more severe punishments on those who violated the Act. Fair Housing Laws The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is responsible for enforcing a variety of fair housing laws, which prohibit discrimination in both privately owned and publicly assisted housing including: *The Fair Housing Act- Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Fair Housing Act), as amended, prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (including children under the age of 18 living with parents or legal custodians, pregnant women, and people securing custody of children under the age of 18), and handicap (disability) *Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964- Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. *Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973- Section 504 prohibits discrimination based on disability in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. *Section 109 of Title 1 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974- Section 109 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex or religion in programs and activities receiving financial assistance from HUD's Community Development and Block Grant Program. *Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990- Title II prohibits discrimination based on disability in programs, services, and activities provided or made available by public entities. HUD enforces Title II when it relates to state and local public housing, housing assistance and housing referrals. *Architectural Barriers Act of 1968- The Architectural Barriers Act requires that buildings and facilities designed, constructed, altered, or leased with certain federal funds after September 1969 must be accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. *Age Discrimination Act of 1975- The Age Discrimination Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance. *Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972- Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. =Fair Housing-Related Presidential Executive Orders= *Executive Order 11063- prohibits discrimination in the sale, leasing, rental, or other disposition of properties and facilities owned or operated by the federal government or provided with federal funds Executive Order 11246 as amended, bars discrimination in federal employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. *Executive Order 12892- as amended, requires federal agencies to affirmatively further fair housing in their programs and activities, and provides that the Secretary of HUD will be responsible for coordinating the effort. The Order also establishes the President's Fair Housing Council, which will be chaired by the Secretary of HUD. *Executive Order 12898- requires that each federal agency conduct its program, policies, and activities that substantially affect human health or the environment in a manner that does not exclude persons based on race, color, or national origin. *Executive Order 13166- eliminates, to the extent possible, limited English proficiency as a barrier to full and meaningful participation by beneficiaries in all federally assisted and federally conducted programs and activities. *Executive Order 13217- requires federal agencies to evaluate their policies and programs to determine if any can be revised or modified to improve the availability of community-based living arrangements for persons with disabilities. Fair Housing Hotline One of the main functions of FHEO is to provide an administrative complaint process that is available free of charge to any person who believes they have faced housing discrimination because of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability to voice their concerns. FHEO conducts intake of all housing- related discrimination complaints and conducts investigation. Any person who thinks they have experienced housing discrimination is encouraged to call the toll free Housing Discrimination Hotline. Work FHEO consists of one headquarters office in Department of Housing and Urban Development building in Washington, DC and has ten regional offices across the country. The regional offices enforce fair housing laws; conduct training, outreach, and compliance monitoring; and work with state and local agencies to administer fair housing programs. The headquarters office is responsible for proposing fair housing legislation; working with other government agencies on fair housing issues; reviewing and making comments on proposed rules, handbooks, legislation, draft reports, and notices of funding availability from other departments within HUD; interpret policy, process complaints, perform compliance reviews, and offer technical assistance to local housing authorities and community development agencies regarding Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act on 1968; conduct oversight of the Government Sponsored Enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to ensure consistency with the Fair Housing Act and the fair housing provisions of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act; and work with private industry and community advocates on the promotion of voluntary fair housing compliance. In addition, FHEO manages the Fair Housing Assistance Program and the Fair Housing Initiatives Program. As of June 2014, the head of FHEO is Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Gustavo Velasquez, whose appointment was confirmed on June 19, 2014. Fair Housing Month Since the Fair Housing Act was passed on April 11, 1968, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity has celebrated April as Fair Housing Month. Every April, state and local governments as well as non-profit organizations hold events and conduct activities to celebrate Fair Housing Month. Fair Housing Programs In addition to its enforcement of fair housing laws, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity oversees a number of fair housing-related programs. Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP)- The Fair Housing Assistance Program provides funding annually on a noncompetitive basis to State and local agencies that enforce fair housing laws that are substantially equivalent to the Fair Housing Act. Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP)- The Fair Housing Initiatives Program provides funding to fair housing organizations and other non-profits who assist people who believe they have been victims of housing discrimination. FHIP organizations conduct preliminary investigation of claims of discrimination and help people who have been discriminated against contact their local government agency. Section 3 Section 3 is a provision of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 the helps foster local economic development, neighborhood economic improvement, and individual self-sufficiency. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development administers the Section 3 program. The Section 3 program requires that recipients of certain HUD financial assistance, to the greatest extent feasible, provide job training, employment, and contracting opportunities for low- or very low- income residents in connection with projects and activities in their neighborhoods.  Notable cases  In Las Vegas in 2002, a developer was made to pay $350,000 to retrofit a condominium complex to bring it into compliance with the Fair Housing Act and to compensate disabled persons who were harmed by the complex's lack of accessible features. In Idaho also in 2002, an eighteen unit apartment complex was retrofitted to make it accessible to persons with disabilities and the payment of an additional $48,000 in damages and penalties.

Its studio and transmitter are located at Camp SEA Site, Brgy. Banilad, Dumaguete City. DYSR is notable to be the oldest radio station in Dumaguete (in terms of AM and FM stations broadcasting there), being launched on August 26, 1950 in the AM band. The station was formerly broadcast at 840 kHz from its inception until the Philippines switched AM spacing from 10 kHz to 9 kHz in 1979, and 891 kHz from 1979 or 1980 to 2005 or 2006. The station signs-on every 5:30 AM and signs-off every 12:00 MN daily.

At that time, the station was owned by Silliman University as a nonsectarian and non-profit educational station. Operating at 840 kilocycles, the station at that time also operates as a shortwave station, operating at 6055 kilocycles on the 49 meter band. The station would continue test broadcasts following the initial July 1 broadcast, with the notable extension of broadcasting hours and additional programming, until it was inaugurated on August 26, 1950.The July 8 issue of The Weekly Sillimanian mentions August 27, 1950, the eve of Silliman's founding, the inaugural date, while it was moved to August 26. Its initial staff of DYSR-AM includes Roy Bell as the director of DYSR, Abby Jacobs as the program director and Eliseo Araneta leading the engineering department of DYSR. Silliman's faculty working as part-time staff of programming includes Mary Reese as music director, Boyd Bell as director of farm programming and Justice Venancio Aldecoa (1926–December 14, 2017) as assistant director of farm programming. The latter later became the president of Silliman University from 1983 to 1986. DYSR-AM became one of the notable firsts in Dumaguete radio when the station was launched, having notable in the following: *The first radio station to launch in Dumaguete.

Yap Hall in 2011. It was then later moved to Camp SEA Site in Banilad. Later years DYSR-AM was notable for relaying what's known to be the city's first night flight on March 29, 1975, that led a Fairchild C-123K Provider aircraft landing safely in Sibulan Airport. At that time, the airport did not had runway lights until it was installed 42 years later. The provincial Philippine Constabulary headquarters relayed announcements through this station to car owners to go to the airport and light the runway using headlights, which various car owners responded to the announcement. The announcement on this station gave pilot Eugene Malahay and co-pilot Antonio Paulin time to land the aircraft safely into the airport. In 1979 or in 1980, when the Philippines switched from the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement or NARBA-assigned 10 kHz to the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975-assigned 9 kHz, DYSR-AM switched frequencies from 840 kHz to 891 kHz, which was used by DYSR-AM from then on until its demise 2005 or 2006. =DYSR-FM (1992–present)= Early years DYSR-FM, in the other hand, was launched in 1992, monikered as \\"Sweet Rhythms\\". Throughout its early years as DYSR-FM, various monikers including \\"Metro Radio\\" and the first tenure of \\"SR95\\", which was then re-used in 2014. It would become the last FM station to launch in Dumaguete until in 2013, when DYMD began doing FM operations. As 95.1 Wild FM (2005–2007) In 2005, the National Council of Churches in the Philippines entered an agreement with the University of Mindanao's broadcasting arm, UMBN, to broadcast DYSR-FM as \\"95.1 Wild FM\\", joining other UMBN FM stations operating as \\"Wild FM\\" at that time. The agreement with UMBN ended in 2007. Under Quest Broadcasting/Big Buzz Ventures (2007–2016) In 2007, NCCP signed an agreement with Quest Broadcasting under Big Buzz Ventures to rebrand DYSR-FM as \\"KillerBee 95.1\\". In 2013, as part of the rebranding of all Quest provincial stations, DYSR-FM among with the other Quest provincial stations were rebranded as \\"Magic\\", thus DYSR-FM was renamed as \\"Magic 95.1\\". In the first quarter of 2014, the station reverted its branding back to \\"SR95\\", first used in the late 1990s. However, its current CHR-Top 40 format, programming and ownership remained unchanged besides retaining some Magic (and KillerBee) stingers/jingles aired. It is the one of the two stations affiliated with Quest Broadcasting, Inc. to use a different brand name than Magic, the other one is in Butuan in the Caraga region in Mindanao, branded as \\"Bee FM 102.3\\". Programming SR95 broadcasts in the CHR/Top 40 format. Special programs include \\"The Retro Spin\\" every Friday from 8 a.m. to 12 midnight. During weekends SR95 has the \\"All-Request Saturday\\" and on Sundays the station plays Christian music from 5:30 a.m. to 6 a.m. and from 8 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., Reggae from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., indie and OPM rock under Local Vocal from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., cover versions of popular songs from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and back to CHR/Top 40 music with pop and R&B; genres from 10 p.m. to 12 midnight.

SBN: 8127-0084-8 was a Seventh-day Adventist administrator. He was President of the General Conference from 1897 to 1901. Irwin was born close to Mt. Vernon, Ohio on November 17, 1844. At age 17, he volunteered for the Union Army during the American Civil War, where he was placed with the 20th Regiment of the Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He was captured near Atlanta and spent time at Andersonville Prison. In 1867, Irwin married a schoolteacher named Nettie Johnson. The George Irwin family were converted to the Seventh-Day Adventist faith in 1885 by a series of meetings held by D. E. Lindsay and W. H. Saxby. He became president of the Ohio Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists in 1889. In March 1897, he was elected President of the General Conference at the General Conference session held in Lincoln, Nebraska. As president, he sought to re-organize the duties of the ministry, and made a tour of Australia. A. G. Daniells was elected General Conference President in 1901, and Irwin was asked to replace him as head of the Australian Union. He became disheartened about his time as General Conference president, viewing it as an \\"utter failure.\\" He returned to the United States in 1905 and served as vice-president of the General Conference. He was installed as president of the Pacific Union Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists in 1910. He left this position two years later to become president of the Board of Directors of what is now Loma Linda University. The likely reason for this change was his failing health. He endured health problems until his death on May 23, 1913.

Mainly, the period during World War I when Hitler served as a Gefreiter (lance corporal) in the Bavarian Army, and the era of World War II when Hitler served as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces) through his position as Führer of Nazi Germany. First World War Hitler received the final part of his father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich, where he earned money painting architectural scenes. He may have left Vienna to evade conscription into the Austrian Army. Hitler later claimed that he did not wish to serve the Habsburg Empire because of the mixture of \\"races\\" in its army. The Bavarian police sent him back to Salzburg for induction into the Austrian Army, but he failed his physical exam on 5 February 1914 and returned to Munich. He was 25 years old in August 1914, when Austria-Hungary and the German Empire entered the First World War. Because of his Austrian citizenship, he had to request permission to serve in the Bavarian Army. Permission was granted. On the evidence of a report by the Bavarian authorities in 1924, which questioned how Hitler was allowed to serve in the Bavarian Army, Hitler almost certainly was enlisted through an error on the part of the government. The authorities could not explain why he was not deported back to Austria in 1914 after he failed his physical exam for the Austrian Army; they concluded that the matter of Hitler's citizenship was simply not raised, thus he was allowed to enter the Bavarian Army. In the army, Hitler continued to put forth his German nationalist ideas which he developed from a young age. During the war, Hitler served in France and Belgium in the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment). He was an infantryman in the 1st Company during the First Battle of Ypres (October 1914), which Germans remember as the Kindermord bei Ypern (Ypres Massacre of the Innocents) because approximately 40,000 men (between a third and a half, many of them university students) of nine newly-enlisted infantry divisions became casualties in the first twenty days. Hitler's regiment entered the battle with 3,600 men and at its end mustered only 611 men. By December Hitler's own company of 250 was reduced to 42. Biographer John Keegan claims that this experience drove Hitler to become aloof and withdrawn for the remaining years of war. After the battle, Hitler was promoted from Schütze (private) to Gefreiter (lance corporal). He was assigned to be a regimental message-runner. Postcard sent by Hitler from Munich on 19 December 1916, where he explains how he wants to participate in the battles of the First World War voluntarily Ernst Schmidt; Max Amann, Adolf Hitler (wearing Iron Cross 2d Class medals) with Fuchsl Young Hitler (farthest left at bottom row) posing with other German soldiers and their dog Fuchsl Hitler sitting at far right among soldiers of the \\"List\\" regiment and Fuchsl Some have regarded this assignment as \\"a relatively safe job\\", because regimental headquarters was often several miles behind the Front. According to Thomas Weber, earlier historians of the period had not distinguished between regimental runners, who were based away from the front \\"in relative comfort\\", and company, or battalion runners, who moved among the trenches and were more often under fire. Messengers' duties changed as the German Army on the Western Front settled into defensive mode. Fewer messages went by foot or bicycle and more by telephone. Hitler's circle of close army friends shown in the photographs also served at headquarters. They laughed at \\"Adi\\" for his aversion to smutty stories, and traded their jam rations for his tobacco. In early 1915 Lance Corporal Hitler adopted a stray dog he named Fuchsl (little fox), who was taught many tricks and became his beloved companion. Hitler described him as a \\"proper circus dog\\". In August 1917 the List Regiment transferred to a quiet sector of the front in Alsace. During the journey, both Fuchsl and Hitler's portfolio of sketches and paintings were stolen.Joachimsthaler, A. (1989) Korrektur einer Biographie. Adolf Hitler 1908–1920, München:Herbig, pp. 141–144 Hitler, though heartbroken by his loss, did take his first leave, which consisted of an 18-day visit to Berlin where he stayed with the family of a comrade. The List Regiment fought in many battles, including the First Battle of Ypres (1914), the Battle of the Somme (1916), the Battle of Arras (1917), and the Battle of Passchendaele (1917). During the Battle of Fromelles on 19–20 July 1916 the Australians, mounting their first attack in France, assaulted the Bavarian positions. The Bavarians repulsed the attackers, who suffered the second-highest losses they had on any day on the Western Front, about 7,000 men. The history of the List Regiment hailed this brilliant defense as the \\"personification of the German Army on the Western Front\\". At the Nuremberg Trials, two of his former superiors testified that Hitler had refused to be considered for promotion. Hitler was twice decorated for bravery. He received the relatively common Iron Cross Second Class in 1914 and the Iron Cross First Class in 1918, an honour rarely given to a lance corporal. Hitler's First Class Iron Cross was recommended by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann, a Jewish adjutant in the List Regiment. According to Weber, this rare award was commonly awarded to those posted to regimental headquarters, such as Hitler, who had contact with more senior officers than did combat soldiers. Hitler's Iron Cross First Class was awarded after an attack in open warfare during which messengers were indispensable and on a day in which the depleted regiment lost 60 killed and 211 wounded.Meyer, A. (1934) Mit Adolf Hitler im Bayr. R.I.R. 16 List, Neustat-Aisch: Georg Apperle During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916 Hitler received a wound in his left thigh when a shell exploded at the entrance to the dispatch runners' dugout. He begged not to be evacuated, but was sent for almost two months to the Red Cross hospital at Beelitz in Brandenburg. Thereafter, he was ordered to the depot in Munich. He wrote to his commanding officer, Hauptmann Fritz Wiedemann, asking that he be recalled to the regiment because he could not tolerate Munich when he knew his comrades were at the Front. Wiedemann arranged for Hitler's return to his regiment on 5 March 1917. On 15 October 1918, he and several comrades were temporarily blinded —and according to Friedelind Wagner, Hitler also lost his voice— due to a British mustard gas attack. After initial treatment, Hitler was hospitalized in Pasewalk in Pomerania. While there, on 10 November, Hitler learned of Germany's defeat from a pastor, and—by his own account—on receiving this news he suffered a second bout of blindness. Hitler was outraged by the subsequent Treaty of Versailles (1919), which forced Germany to admit to starting the war, deprived Germany of various territories, demilitarised the Rhineland (which the Allies occupied), and imposed economically damaging sanctions. Hitler later wrote: \\"When I was confined to bed, the idea came to me that I would liberate Germany, that I would make it great. I knew immediately that it would be realized.\\" However, it is unlikely that he committed himself to a career in politics at that point in time. On 19 November 1918, Hitler was discharged from the Pasewalk hospital and returned to Munich. Arriving on 21 November, he was assigned to 7th Company of the 1st Replacement Battalion of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. In December he was reassigned to a Prisoner of War camp in Traunstein as a guard. There he would stay until the camp dissolved January 1919. He returned to Munich and spent a few months in barracks waiting for reassignment. Munich, then part of the People's State of Bavaria, was in a state of chaos with a number of assassinations occurring, including that of socialist Kurt Eisner who was shot dead in Munich by a German nationalist on 21 February 1919. His rival Erhard Auer was also wounded in an attack. Other acts of violence were the killings of both Major Paul Ritter von Jahreiß and the conservative MP Heinrich Osel. In this political turmoil, Berlin sent in the military – called the \\"White Guards of Capitalism\\" by the communists. On 3 April 1919, Hitler was elected as the liaison of his military battalion and again on 15 April. During this time he urged his unit to stay out of the fighting and not join either side. The Bavarian Soviet Republic was officially crushed on 6 May 1919, when Lt. General Burghard von Oven and his military forces declared the city secure. In the aftermath of arrests and executions, Hitler denounced a fellow liaison, Georg Dufter, as a Soviet \\"radical rabble- rouser.\\" Other testimony he gave to the military board of inquiry allowed them to root out other members of the military that \\"had been infected with revolutionary fervor.\\" For his anti-communist views he was allowed to avoid discharge when his unit was disbanded in May 1919. = Army intelligence agent = In June 1919 he was moved to the demobilization office of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. Around this time the German military command released an edict that the army's main priority was to \\"carry out, in conjunction with the police, stricter surveillance of the population ... so that the ignition of any new unrest can be discovered and extinguished.\\" In May 1919 Karl Mayr became commander of the 6th Battalion of the guards regiment in Munich and from 30 May as head of the \\"Education and Propaganda Department\\" (Dept Ib/P) of the Bavarian Reichswehr, Headquarters 4. In this capacity as head of the intelligence department, Mayr recruited Hitler as an undercover agent in early June 1919. Under Captain Mayr \\"national thinking\\" courses were arranged at the Reichswehrlager Lechfeld near Augsburg, with Hitler attending from 10–19 July. During this time Hitler so impressed Mayr that he assigned him to an anti- bolshevik \\"educational commando\\" as 1 of 26 instructors in the summer of 1919. As an appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufklärungskommando (reconnaissance commando) of the Reichswehr, Hitler's job was to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers' Party (DAP). While monitoring the activities of the DAP, Hitler became attracted to the founder Anton Drexler's antisemitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas. Impressed with Hitler's oratory skills, Drexler invited him to join the DAP, which Hitler did on 12 September 1919. = Henry Tandey incident = Although disputed, Hitler and decorated British soldier Henry Tandey allegedly encountered each other at the French village of Marcoing. The story is set on 28 September 1918, while Tandey was serving with the 5th Duke of Wellington's Regiment, and relates that a weary German soldier wandered into Tandey's line of fire. The enemy soldier was wounded and did not even attempt to raise his own rifle. Tandey chose not to shoot. The German soldier saw him lower his rifle and nodded his thanks before wandering off. That soldier is purported to have been Adolf Hitler. The author David Johnson, who wrote a book on Henry Tandey, believes this story was an urban legend. Hitler apparently saw a newspaper report about Tandey being awarded the VC (in October 1918, whilst serving with the 5th Battalion Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) Regiment), recognized him, and clipped the article. In 1937, Hitler was made aware of a particular Fortunino Matania paintinghttp://victoriacross.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/tandey.jpg by Dr Otto Schwend, a member of his staff. Schwend had been a medical officer during the First Battle of Ypres in 1914. He had been sent a copy of the painting by a Lieutenant Colonel Earle in 1936. Earle had been treated by Schwend in a medical post at the Menin Crossroads and they remained in touch after the war. The painting was commissioned by the Green Howards Regiment from the Italian artist in 1923, showing a soldier purported to be Tandey carrying a wounded man at the Kruiseke Crossroads in 1914, northwest of Menin. The painting was made from a sketch, provided to Matania, by the regiment, based on an actual event at that crossroads. A building shown behind Tandey in the painting belonged to the Van Den Broucke family, who were presented with a copy of the painting by the Green Howard's Regiment. Schwend obtained a large photo of the painting. Captain Weidemann, Hitler's adjutant, wrote the following response: Apparently Hitler identified the soldier carrying the wounded man as Tandey from the photo of him in the newspaper clipping he had obtained in 1918. In 1938, when Neville Chamberlain visited Hitler at his alpine retreat, the Berghof, for the discussions that led to the Munich Agreement, he noticed the painting and asked about it. Hitler replied: > That man came so near to killing me that I thought I should never see > Germany again; Providence saved me from such devilishly accurate fire as > those English boys were aiming at us. According to the story, Hitler asked Chamberlain to convey his best wishes and gratitude to Tandey. Chamberlain promised to phone Tandey in person on his return, which apparently he did. The Cadbury Research Centre, which holds copies of Chamberlain's papers and diaries, has no references relating to Tandey from the records of the 1938 meeting.http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/cadbury/documents/personal- archives-guide.pdf The story further states that the phone was answered by a nine-year-old child called William Whateley. William was related to Tandey's wife Edith. However, Tandey at that time lived at 22 Cope Street, Coventry, and worked for the Triumph Motor Company. According to the company records, they only had three phone lines, none of which was at Tandey's address. British Telecommunications archive records also have no telephones registered to that address in 1938. Historical research throws serious doubts on whether the incident actually ever occurred. Hitler took his second leave from military service on 10 September 1918 for 18 days. This means that he was in Germany on the presumed date of the facts.Ian Kershaw's Hitler biography \\"Hitler 1889–1936 Hubris\\" at the end of chapter 3 part 3 Paramilitary career Hitler in his brownshirt SA uniform wearing the Nuremberg Party Day Badge and his World War I Iron Cross Chancellor and President. After Hitler became the leader of the Nazi Party, he began acquiring paramilitary-like titles and using Nazi Party paramilitary uniforms to denote his position. Hitler's main title within the Nazi Party was simply that of Führer (leader) and there was never any special uniform designed for Hitler's position. The brown Nazi Party uniform that Hitler is most often associated with was a paramilitary uniform of the SA and denoted Hitler's position as Oberster SA- Führer. Hitler was, by default as Führer, the supreme commander of every Nazi paramilitary organization, but he never adopted extra ranks in these organizations nor did he have special uniforms to denote his position. Hitler also technically qualified for every Nazi political decoration, but in practice only wore his World War I Iron Cross, the Golden Nazi Party Pin, and the Wound Badge in Black. During Nazi rallies at Nuremberg in the early 1930s, Hitler temporarily wore the 1929 Nuremberg Party Day Badge, but discontinued this after about 1935. Rearmament Six days after being sworn in as Chancellor in 1933, Hitler met with the German military leaders, declaring that his first priority was rearmament. The new Defense Minister, General Werner von Blomberg, introduced Nazi principles into the armed forces, emphasizing the concept of Volksgemeinschaft (national community), in which Germans were united in a classless society.Messerschmidt, M. (1969). Die Wehrmacht im NS-staat. Zeit der indoctrination, Hamburg:Decker's Verlag, pp. 18–47 \\"The uniform makes all men equal.\\"Schoenbaum, D.(1967). Hitler's social revolution. Class and Status in Nazi Germany 1933–1939, London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, p. 68 Military rank specified a chain of command, not class boundaries. Officers were instructed to mingle with other ranks. Blomberg's decree on the army and National Socialism on 25 May 1934 ordered: \\"When non- commissioned officers and men take part in any festivity, care must be taken that the officers do not all sit together. I request that this guidance be given the most serious attention.\\"O'Neill, R. J. (1966). The German Army and the Nazi Party, 1933–1939, London: Cassell, p. 65 The rapidly expanding armed forces enlisted many new officers and men from the Hitler Youth. The American William L. Shirer reported that all ranks ate the same rations, socialized when off duty, and that officers were concerned with their men's personal problems.Shirer, W.S. (1941). Berlin Diary, London: Hamish Hamilton, p. 346 On 1 August 1934, a new law stated that on Hindenburg's death the presidency would be abolished, and its powers merged with those of the Chancellor. From that day onward, Hitler would be known as Führer and Reich Chancellor. As head of state, Hitler became supreme commander of all armed forces. Hindenburg died the following day. (The new office was confirmed by a plebiscite on 19 August 1934.) Blomberg, on his own initiative, introduced the Oath of 2 August 1934: \\"I swear by God this sacred oath that I will render unconditional obedience to the Führer of the German Reich and people, Adolf Hitler, the commander in chief of the armed forces, and, as a brave soldier, will be prepared at all times to stake my life for this oath.\\" (In 1939, God was removed from the oath.Rosinski, H. (1939). The German Army, London: Hogarth Press, p. 237) The Reichswehr was reorganized as the Wehrmacht on 21 May 1935, bringing the army, navy and air force under unified command. Hitler guided the steps of their rearmament, thanks to his retentive memory and interest in technical questions. General Alfred Jodl wrote that Hitler's \\"astounding technical and tactical vision led him also to become the creator of modern weaponry for the army\\". He hammered home arguments by reciting long passages from Frederick the Great and other military thinkers. \\"Although the generals might at times refer to Hitler as a 'facile amateur', he was so far as an understanding of military history and weapons technology went, better educated and equipped than most of them.\\" On 4 February 1938, after Blomberg's disgrace and retirement, Hitler announced in a decree: \\"From henceforth I exercise personally the immediate command over the whole armed forces.\\" He abolished the War Ministry and took Blomberg's other title, Commander-in-Chief, for himself. By that year's end, the army had more than 1 million men and 25,000 officers. World War II Hitler's gray uniform tunic with the Golden party Badge; Iron Cross and Wound badge. He is also wearing a Swastika armband on his left arm. On 1 September 1939, at Kroll Opera House followings the declaration of war, Hitler declared: \\"From now on I am just the first soldier of the German Reich. I have once more put on the coat that was most sacred and dear to me. I will not take it off again until victory is secured, or I will not survive the outcome.\\" From then on, he began wearing a grey military jacket with a swastika eagle sewn on the upper left sleeve. Throughout the war, the only military decorations Hitler displayed were his Wound Badge and Iron Cross from World War I and the Nazi Golden Party Badge. Hitler's position in World War II was essentially supreme commander of the German Armed Forces (Oberbefehlshaber der Deutschen Wehrmacht). After ordering the preparations for the attack on Poland, he scrutinized all of the orders the staff prepared for the first three days of operations down to the regimental level. He rewrote the plans for the capture of a crucial bridge, making them much bolder. His status with the military escalated when they seized Norway and conquered Western Europe, with the major thrust coming through the Ardennes, which he had implemented despite the misgivings of many professional advisers. On 19 December 1941, Hitler appointed himself Commander-in-Chief of the German Army (Heer), thus taking a direct operational posting usually held by a full German general. Overconfident in his own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940, Hitler became distrustful of his Army High Command and began to interfere in military and tactical planning with damaging consequences. By late 1942, he began to make disastrous mistakes. The historian who wrote the Wehrmacht war diary concluded that, \\"... within him the tension between rational insight and emotional delusion was never resolved\\", and that he was one of the \\"terrible simplifiers who thought to reduce the complexity of life to the dogmas they had worked out.\\" Late in the war by 22 April 1945, Hitler told Generals Wilhelm Keitel and Jodl that he had no further orders to give.

Dr. Olsen explains the purpose of the project is to create an emotional bond between people with the hopes of putting an end to evil in the world. By doing this, according to Dr. Olsen, he must form a bond between twins. Over the course of the project, which uses the same fruit as Dr. Spaulding's experiments, Zack and Cody form a bond: first a physical bond, in which they can sense what the other is feeling, then empathy, or an emotional bond. After they develop these bonds, they overhear a conversation that reveals Dr. Olsen has evil intentions. Meanwhile, Bailey discovers Cody's letter and reads it. She realizes Cody only wanted to obtain a scholarship to Yale and goes with London and Woody (Matthew Timmons) to find him. At the institute, London learns from a dolphin that Zack and Cody are at the Gemini Project and alerts Dr. Spaulding who claims that the Martin twins may be in danger. Bailey calls the manager of the SS Tipton, Mr. Moseby (Phill Lewis), to the site of the Gemini Project while they all go to save Zack and Cody. During this time, the brothers attempt to flee the island and the army of twins, who are now mind-controlled to go after the two. The army succeeds, as Zack and Cody are captured and taken back to the laboratory, where Bailey, London, Woody, and Dr. Spaulding find them. Dr. Olsen reveals that he is Dr. Spaulding's evil twin and explains that he spied on Zack and Cody earlier. After telling each other off, Zack and Cody begin to merge, but the merge is unsuccessful because the twins get into an argument that escalates into a fight, ultimately destroying the Gemini Project and freeing all the other twins from Ronald’s control. Ronald attempts to reboot the machine, but he is stopped by Cody who quickly forms a plan, and he and Zack give the special fruit to the Spaulding twins, who finally understand each other by telepathically discovering they wanted to be like each other all along. Mr. Moseby comes in with the police who arrest Ronald. Zack and Cody now understand that they make a \\"pretty good team.\\" Afterward, Cody and Bailey have reconciled and visited landmarks together and Zack is driving his car, which Cody finally agreed to let him have. On the dock, Zack parks the car in a shipping area and sees his friends and brother on the SS Tipton. Unfortunately, the car is crushed by a shipping crate containing London's summer clothes. While Zack stares in shock, the movie ends with Mr. Moseby saying, \\"Well, spring break's over. Now if I could just make it to summer vacation.\\" Cast * Cole Sprouse as Cody Martin * Dylan Sprouse as Zack Martin * Brenda Song as London Tipton * Debby Ryan as Bailey Pickett * Matthew Timmons as Woody Fink * Phill Lewis as Mr. Moseby * John Ducey as Dr. Donald Spaulding / Dr. Ronald Spaulding * Matthew Glave as Dr. Ronald Olsen * Katelyn Pacitto as Nellie Smith * Kara Pacitto as Kellie Smith * Steven French as Ben * John French as Sven * Norman Misura as Fish Monger * Russ Rossi as Sea Captain Broadcast The film aired worldwide on Disney Channel.
