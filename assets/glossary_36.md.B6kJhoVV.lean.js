She began her senior career with Cardiff City before joining Swansea City in 2013. After two seasons, she joined Reading in February 2015, initially combining her playing career with a job in the prison service. She turned professional later the same year after helping the club win promotion to the FA Women's Super League. She made her international debut for Wales in 2017. Early life Rowe lived in Swansea, Wales where she began playing football at a young age. Her father suffered from alcoholism and she later commented that their \\"relationship deteriorated\\" due to his drinking before his death when Rowe was 21. She took a job at HM Prison Swansea as an operational support guard and later fulfilled the same role at HM Prison Cardiff. The role included performing vehicle checks and escorting contractors onto prison wings to perform maintenance work. She later enrolled on a business management course provided by the Welsh Government. Club career Rowe initially played for a local boys youth team but later stated that \\"nobody wanted to play with me\\". She was spotted by a scout from Swansea City Ladies and played for the club's youth academy. However, she began her senior career with the club's local rivals Cardiff City and won the inaugural Welsh Premier Women's Football League title during the 2012–13 season, scoring in their decisive 5–2 victory over Wrexham in the final game of the season. She returned to Swansea during the summer window soon after. However, she suffered a broken leg while playing against her former team during the first half of the following campaign. In February 2015, Rowe joined WSL 2 side Reading with assistant manager Kelly Chambers describing her as possessing \\"an abundance of competiveness along with her pace, strength and work rate\\". Despite the move, Rowe remained semi-professional during her first year, making the 300-mile round trip from her home in Swansea to training three times every week while remaining in her job with the prison service. In December 2015, she signed a professional contract with Reading following the club's promotion to FA Women's Super League. Following promotion, Rowe converted to playing as a full-back for a period, having originally joined the club as a winger. At the start of the 2018–19 season, she featured in a 1–0 victory over Liverpool. However, the following month, she suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in a friendly match that ended her season after a single appearance. Despite her injury setback, she was offered a new contract with the club at the end of the campaign. International career Rowe (right) during her international debut in 2015 Having previously represented Wales at under-17 and under-19 level, Rowe made her debut for the senior side in Wales' first UEFA Women's Euro 2017 qualifying match against Austria starting in a 3–0 defeat in Sankt Pölten.

This Sanskrit text is classified as one of 14 Vaishnava Upanishads, and a Mantra Upanishad. It is one of the 19 Upanishads attached to the Shukla Yajurveda. The text is notable for its discussion of Om for yogic meditation as Taraka or that which helps one cross from mundane into spiritual world. It is one of the texts which mentions the \\"Om Namo Narayana\\" mantra of Vaishnavism. The Upanishad discusses the Om mantra, and integrates into its sound, the central characters of the epic Ramayana such as Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Bharata, Shatrughna and Jambavan. It also asserts that Hanuman is a manifestation of Shiva. History The date or author of Tarasara Upanishad is unknown. The first chapter of this Upanishad is identical with the influential and ancient Jabala Upanishad. Thereafter the text of both Upanishads are different. The Tarasara Upanishad, according to Deussen, incorporates partly an elaborated text from sections 5 and 6 of the Ramottaratapaniya Upanishad. The text assumes the existence of Ramottaratapaniya Upanishad, suggesting a relative chronology. Instead of a mantra focussed entirely on King Rama as in Ramottaratapaniya, the Tarasara text incorporates the mantra \\"Om Namo Narayanaya\\", as a 'tarakam' meaning \\"deliverer.\\" Manuscripts of this text are also found titled as Tarasaropanisad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 270, 385 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 91. It appears in the collection of Upanishads under the title \\"Oupanekhat\\", put together by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, the Tarasara or Taraka Upanishad is listed at number 46 as “Tark”. Dara Shikoh's collection was in the same order as found in Upanishad anthologies popular in north India. But it does not find mention in the 52 Upanishads version of Colebrooke or in compilation of Upanishads by Narayana – an Indian scholar who lived sometime after the 14th-century CE, and republished in the modern era as the Bibliothica Indica edition. Contents The text has three chapters, with the first a repeat of the first chapter of the Jabala Upanishad. The second and third chapter focus on describing the Om mantra, it being the ultimate and highest reality Brahman, and its relationship to Narayana (Vishnu). Just like the Jabala Upanishad,Jabala Upanishad, Tr: Sunder Harrangadi (2000), SanskritDocuments.Org Archive, Section 1 the chapter 1 of the Upanishad, is structured as a conversation between Brihaspati and Yajnavalkya. The latter states that true Kurukshetra is Avimuktam – a place that Shiva never left and a part of Varanasi (Banaras). This place, recommends the text, is for all those renouncers who after having wandered places, can stay in. This is the place, asserts the Upanishad, where Rudra imparts the moksha knowledge just when the last vital breaths of the dying are departing, leading one to videhamukti. This place is a spiritual seat of all living beings (holy), asserts the text, a place to revere and not leave. The Upanishad thereafter glorifies Narayana, by stating that \\"Om Namo Narayana\\" is the means to cross from mundane world into spiritual world (Taraka). Om in this mantra is Atman (self, soul) asserts the text, Namah represents Prakriti (nature, changing reality), and Narayana is the nature of Parabrahman (supreme Brahman). The text further describes how the sound fragments of the mantra \\"Om Namo Narayanaya\\" includes Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Ishvara, all of the universe, Purusha, Bhagavan and Param-atman (supreme self). Om is also the indestructible, unchanging reality (Brahman), states the text, which alone ought to be worshipped. The \\"Om\\" mantra has eight subtle sound elements, describes the Upanishad, \\"A\\", \\"U\\", \\"M\\", bindu, nada, kala (era, present time), kalatita (beyond present era, or future), and the last subtle sound element is what is beyond kalatita. Rama with bow, flanked by Lakshmi and Sri in Prambanan Hindu temple, Indonesia. They are mentioned in this text. In chapter 2, the Upanishad describes the same Om mantra in terms of the characters of the Hindu epic Ramayana. The \\"A\\" is the source of Brahma who became Jambavat, from \\"U\\" came Vishnu who became Surgriva, from \\"M\\" of AUM mantra came Shiva who manifested as Hanuman, states the text. The bindu of Om became Shatrughna (third brother of Rama), the nada became Bharata (elder brother of Rama), kala resonance became Lakshmana (younger brother of Rama), the kalatita became Lakshmi who manifested as goddess Sita (a Shakti, wife of Rama), and beyond all this is the last subtle part of Om which is Supreme Self manifesting as Rama. The text next presents eight mantras, asserting them to be a means to realize the Atman. These repeat the mapping of elements of Om mantra to the characters of the Ramayana, calling Rama as Paramatman, Narayana and supreme Purusha (cosmic man), the ancient Purushottama, the eternal, the liberated, the true, the highest bliss, the one without a second. The mantra reciter should meditate, states the text, \\"Brahman is myself, I am Rama\\". A mastery of this Ashtakshara mantra, the Upanishad states, is equivalent to uttering the Gayatri mantra a hundred thousand times and to learning Itihasas, Puranas, and Rudra Mantras. This is the path of inner purification, this is the way to see the supreme seat of Vishnu, states Tarasara Upanishad.

One of these organisations was the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE). JUSE brought leaders and experts from all of Japan’s major industries together to share the best practices. It was directed to \\"revitalise Japan’s economy and [eliminate] waste by improving quality\\". It was established in May 1946 by the Science and Technology Agency (now known as the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) of the Government of Japan. Under the patronage of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, the JUSE invited W. Edwards Deming, an American engineer and statistician to lecture them on the use of statistical quality control. He arrived in June 1950 and he returned again on five occasions as consultant to Japanese industry. The following year the JUSE established the Deming Prize, which was originally awarded to individuals who had contributed to the theory and application of quality control and to corporations which had obtained outstanding results in the application of quality control. Joseph M. Juran was also invited to give lectures to the JUSE in 1954 and 1960. His lectures centered on managing quality and in making quality a business strategy.

Written by Paul Auster, the film is about an author who having just completed his fourth novel travels to his friends' vacant country house to spend a few weeks alone. There he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman who inspires him to write a new story. Filmed in Azenhas do Mar in Sintra, Portugal in the spring of 2006, The Inner Life of Martin Frost is Auster's fourth film as director and writer. The film premiered at the New Directors/New Films Festival on March 21, 2007, and was released in the United States on September 7, 2007. Plot After having completed his fourth novel, successful author Martin Frost (David Thewlis) travels to the vacant country house of his friends Jack and Diane to spend some time alone and \\"live the life of a stone\\". Secluded amidst a grove of trees, the quiet cottage filled with wall-lined bookshelves offers Martin the solitude he longs for. After spending time in the surrounding countryside, Martin feels driven to write a new story. Using his friends' old typewriter, he begins the writing process and pledges to himself that he will not leave the cottage until the story is complete. Martin's writing routine is shaken, however, when he wakes up the next morning and discovers a beautiful woman lying beside him in bed. At first, both are shocked by the other's appearance in the house, but the woman introduces herself as Claire Martin (Irène Jacob) the niece of the owners, and reveals that she's read all of his books and stories. They agree to stay in the house together, but he insists that he wants to be left alone. Over the coming days, he becomes fascinated by this mysterious woman and engages in intimate discussions about philosophy and creativity with her. Eventually he falls in love with Claire, and the two make love. Thrilled with his new-found romantic relationship, Martin proceeds with writing his new story. As the story nears completion, however, Claire suddenly collapses on the lawn and falls seriously ill. Despite Martin's efforts to care for her, she falls deeper into a feverish state. After completing his new story, he discovers Claire has died. Suddenly realizing the mysterious connection between Claire and the story, Martin quickly throws the type-written pages into the fire, thereby reviving Claire. While the couple celebrate their love for each, Claire is troubled by his act of burning his story. On their way to the airport to go to Martin's home in New York City, they get a flat tire. Martin walks off to find a service station for assistance, leaving Claire behind with the car. While he's away, she runs off into the woods and disappears. Soon after, the broken-hearted Martin meets a local plumber, Jim Fortunato (Michael Imperioli), who also happens to be a writer of short stories. Jim talks Martin into reading three of his works to get his advice. Sometime later, Jim shows up at the cottage with his orphan niece Anna James (Sophie Auster) and offers her housecleaning services in return for his reading the stories. The shy girl turns out to be a talented singer and actress, and Martin agrees to let her stay with him. At the cottage, Anna meets Claire hiding in the bedroom and offers her help. Later, Anna directs Martin to put on a blindfold. After the blindfold is secure, Claire emerges and embraces the surprised and grateful Martin. Claire warns him that he cannot look at her or else she will disappear. The next day, as Martin and Anna prepare to drive to the airport, Claire enters the car and sits in the back seat, assuring Martin that he is allowed to look at her in mirrors. The two look at each other lovingly in the rearview mirror, and the three drive off together. Cast * David Thewlis as Martin Frost * Irène Jacob as Claire Martin * Michael Imperioli as Jim Fortunato * Sophie Auster as Anna James * Paul Auster as Narrator Production Principal photography took place from May 6 to June 6, 2006 in Azenhas do Mar in Sintra, Portugal. Studio scenes were filmed at Estúdios Nova Imagem studios in Portugal. Critical response The Inner Life of Martin Frost received mixed reviews upon its theatrical release. In his review for PopMatters, culture critic Stuart Henderson gave the film nine out of ten stars, calling it a \\"tiny, Bergmanesque chamber movie\\" that announces \\"the emergence of a fully-fledged filmmaker\\". Henderson notes that the story being written by the character Martin Frost is not merely a story, but in fact is the character of Claire Martin, and she is the story. \\"As he nears its completion,\\" Henderson observes, \\"she falls ill, and drifts ever closer to her own end.\\" Henderson praises Auster's juxtaposition of styles of the two halves of the film. The introduction of a local plumber (played by Michael Imperioli) infuses the second half of the film \\"with a warmth and humour that the tragic first act only hinted towards\\". Auster's \\"flirtation with Bergman\\" in the first half of the film transitions into \\"a playful bow to Jean Cocteau's Orpheus\\". Summarizing his thoughts on the film, Henderson concludes: The film also received negative reviews. In his review in The New York Times, film critic Matt Zoller Seitz found the movie's style to be \\"aggressively literary, with plummy third-person narration ... that over-interrogates every development, and close-ups of significant objects ... that aim for talismanic power but don't get there\\". Seitz concludes that the film \\"plays like a half- baked tribute to Wings of Desire. In her review for the New York Daily News, Elizabeth Weitzman gave the film one and a half out of four stars, calling it a \\"suffocating romance\\" that made her feel as if she were \\"helplessly stuck inside the head of the most pretentious person you know\\".

Prior to joining the McGill Faculty of Religious Studies in 1975 he was MacDougald Professor of Systematic Theology at St Andrew's College in the University of Saskatchewan (1965–1975), Principal of St Paul's College in the University of Waterloo (1962–1965), and minister of St Andrew's Church in Blind River, Ontario (1960–1962).  Early life and education  Hall was born on March 23, 1928, in Ingersoll, Ontario. He attended high school and business college in Woodstock, Ontario, and worked for four years in that city's daily newspaper. In 1948–1949 he studied composition and piano at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. He was graduated (Bachelor of Arts) from the University of Western Ontario (London) in 1953. His graduate degrees are all from Union Theological Seminary in New York City: Master of Divinity (1956), Master of Sacred Theology (1957), Doctor of Theology (1963).  Professional life  The author of 24 published works, including a three-volume systematic theology, and numerous articles, Hall lectured widely in the United States and Canada during the period 1974–2010. He was Gastprofessor at the University of Siegen, Germany, in 1980; Visiting Scholar at Doshisha University in Kyoto, Japan, in 1989; Professor of Theology at the Melanchthon Institute of Houston, Texas, in 1999; member of the Campbell Seminar on the Future of the Church at Columbia Seminary of Decatur, Georgia, in 2000; Distinguished Visiting Professor at Trinity Lutheran Seminary, Columbus, Ohio, in 2001; Theologian-in-Residence, Church of the Crossroads in Honolulu, Hawaii (2003 f.); and Theologian-in-Residence, International Protestant Church in Vienna (2003). Hall was an active participant in many international consultations including the World Convocation of the World Council of Churches (WCC) in Seoul, South Korea, 1990, and the UN AIDS theological symposium in Namibia (2003). He served on theological committees of the WCC and the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, the United Church of Canada, the National Council of Churches USA, et al.  Thought  Influenced by his teachers Reinhold Niebuhr, Paul Tillich, John Coleman Bennett, and others, as well as fellow-Canadians including George Grant and Emil Fackenheim, Hall desired to understand and further the biblical and mainstream Reformation Protestant traditions of critical and constructive theology. He argues that over the past two centuries the Christian religion has been experiencing a momentous and (for most) disconcerting transition (\\"metamorphosis\\"): after fifteen centuries of legal and cultural \\"Establishment\\" in the West, Christianity is being challenged by the evolution of planetary history to assume a more modest, dialogical and humanly responsible position in the new global society. Accordingly, he believes, the church must abandon the theological triumphalism that has typified its long fraternization with empire, and search its biblical and doctrinal traditions for ways of engaging, rather than seeking to monopolize the spiritual and intellectual life of humankind. In his books and lectures Hall argues that the stance (modus vivendi) appropriate to Christianity in the post-Christendom context is best illuminated by the (\\"never much loved\\" [Moltmann]) theological tradition that Martin Luther named theologia crucis (‘theology of the cross’). That tradition, which Luther distinguished from the dominant religious and ecclesiastical conventions of Christendom (all variations of the theologia gloriae ,‘theology of glory’), accentuates God's compassionate solidarity with the world; thus it opens the Christian movement to both secular and other faith-communities that seek planetary \\"peace, justice and the integrity of creation\\" [the theme of the World Council of Churches, Vancouver 1983-1990]., Hall affirms that theology, in contrast to both \\"doctrine\\" and piety (\\"spirituality\\"), involves both historical knowledge and conscious, informed immersion in one's cultural context [contextuality]. Authentic theology only occurs where the claims of faith meet and wrestle with the great (characteristically repressed) questions and instabilities of the Zeitgeist [spirit of the times]. \\"Establishment\\" Christianity was content to transmit dogma and morality from place to place, generation to generation; post- Christendom theology entails original and diligent thinking [Denkarbeit!] including the entertainment of doubt and disbelief, on the part of the disciple-community. Today faith in all its forms and expressions is called to rescue human thinking as such from its captivation by \\"technical reason\\" (Tillich) or rechnendes Denken (Heidegger), as it manifests itself today (e.g.) in the West's educational emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) often to the virtual exclusion of the arts and humanities (Sciences humaines et sociales).  Personal life  Hall married the late Rhoda Catherine Palfrey, a fellow Canadian and graduate student at Columbia University, in 1960 at Riverside Church, New York City. They have four adult children (Kate, Christopher, Sara and Lucy), three of whom are professional musicians, and eight grandchildren.

Structure There are a number of strategies to implement composite entity pattern. This pattern mainly composites of composite entity, coarse-grained object, and dependent objects. Composite entity pattern class diagram =Composite entity component= Composite entity is the coarse-grained entity bean which may be the coarse-grained object, or may contain a reference to the coarse-grained object. =Coarse-grained object= A coarse-grained object is an object with its own life cycle manages its own relationships to other objects. It can be an object contained in the composite entity, or, composite entity itself can be the coarse-grained object which holds dependent objects. =Dependent objects= It is an object, which can contain other dependent objects (there may be a tree of objects within the composite entity), that depends on the coarse-grained object and has its life cycle managed by the coarse-grained object. Consequences According to Oracle description of the pattern, consequences include eliminating inter-entity relationships, improving manageability by reducing entity beans, improving network performance, reducing database schema dependency, increasing object granularity, facilitating composite transfer object creation and overhead of multi-level dependent object graphs. =Drawbacks= The fatal drawback is the requirement of bean-managed persistent (BMP) bean. This involves more work for developers, and create some problems as follows: * materializing all the data in a coarse- grained entity whenever it is accessed, is unacceptably expensive * In Java, implementation of the ejbStore() method needs to be smart enough to avoid issuing all the updates required to persist the entire state of the object, unless the data has changed in all the persistent objects. Composite entity pattern can only be implemented using BMP or by adding more hand-coded persistence logic to container managed persistence (CMP) beans. These both approaches reduce the maintainability. Sample code Sample code for a Professional Service Automation application (PSA) in which the resource object is implemented via composite entity pattern, may look like as follows (entity implements coarse-grained object): package corepatterns.apps.psa.ejb; import corepatterns.apps.psa.core.*; import corepatterns.apps.psa.dao.*; import java.sql.*; import javax.sql.*; import java.util.*; import javax.ejb.*; import javax.naming.*; public class ResourceEntity implements EntityBean { public String employeeId; public String lastName; public String firstName; public String departmentId; public String practiceGroup; public String title; public String grade; public String email; public String phone; public String cell; public String pager; public String managerId; // Collection of BlockOutTime Dependent objects public Collection blockoutTimes; // Collection of SkillSet Dependent objects public Collection skillSets; ... private EntityContext context; // Entity Bean methods implementation public String ejbCreate(ResourceTO resource) throws CreateException { try { this.employeeId = resource.employeeId; setResourceData(resource); getResourceDAO().create(resource); } catch(Exception ex) { throw new EJBException(\\"Reason:\\" + ...); } return this.employeeId; } public String ejbFindByPrimaryKey(String primaryKey) throws FinderException { boolean result; try { ResourceDAO resourceDAO = getResourceDAO(); result = resourceDAO.selectByPrimaryKey(primaryKey); } catch(Exception ex) { throw new EJBException(\\"Reason:\\" + ...); } if (result) { return primaryKey; } else { throw new ObjectNotFoundException(...); } } public void ejbRemove() { try { // Remove dependent objects if (this.skillSets != null) { SkillSetDAO skillSetDAO = getSkillSetDAO(); skillSetDAO.setResourceID(employeeId); skillSetDAO.deleteAll(); skillSets = null; } if (this.blockoutTime != null) { BlockOutTimeDAO blockouttimeDAO = getBlockOutTimeDAO(); blockouttimeDAO.setResourceID(employeeId); blockouttimeDAO.deleteAll(); blockOutTimes = null; } // Remove the resource from the persistent store ResourceDAO resourceDAO = new ResourceDAO(employeeId); resourceDAO.delete(); } catch(ResourceException ex) { throw new EJBException(\\"Reason:\\"+...); } catch(BlockOutTimeException ex) { throw new EJBException(\\"Reason:\\"+...); } catch(Exception exception) { ... } } public void setEntityContext(EntityContext context) { this.context = context; } public void unsetEntityContext() { context = null; } public void ejbActivate() { employeeId = (String)context.getPrimaryKey(); } public void ejbPassivate() { employeeId = null; } public void ejbLoad() { try { // load the resource info from ResourceDAO resourceDAO = getResourceDAO(); setResourceData((ResourceTO) resourceDAO.load(employeeId)); // Load other dependent objects, if necessary ... } catch(Exception ex) { throw new EJBException(\\"Reason:\\" + ...); } } public void ejbStore() { try { // Store resource information getResourceDAO().update(getResourceData()); // Store dependent objects as needed ... } catch(SkillSetException ex) { throw new EJBException(\\"Reason:\\" + ...); } catch(BlockOutTimeException ex) { throw new EJBException(\\"Reason:\\" + ...); } ... } public void ejbPostCreate(ResourceTO resource) { } // Method to Get Resource Transfer Object public ResourceTO getResourceTO() { // create a new Resource Transfer Object ResourceTO resourceTO = new ResourceTO(employeeId); // copy all values resourceTO.lastName = lastName; resourceTO.firstName = firstName; resourceTO.departmentId = departmentId; ... return resourceTO; } public void setResourceData(ResourceTO resourceTO) { // copy values from Transfer Object into entity bean employeeId = resourceTO.employeeId; lastName = resourceTO.lastName; ... } // Method to get dependent Transfer Objects public Collection getSkillSetsData() { // If skillSets is not loaded, load it first. // See Lazy Load strategy implementation. return skillSets; } ... // other get and set methods as needed ... // Entity bean business methods public void addBlockOutTimes(Collection moreBOTs) throws BlockOutTimeException { // Note: moreBOTs is a collection of // BlockOutTimeTO objects try { Iterator moreIter = moreBOTs.iterator(); while (moreIter.hasNext()) { BlockOutTimeTO botTO = (BlockOutTimeTO) moreIter.next(); if (!

The mountain is separated from the Aperriesspitze (2,588 m) by the Hinterseejoch (2,482 m). To the west of this saddle, in a cirque, lies the lake of Hintersee, east of the col is lake of Vordersee which gives the mountain its name. The neighbouring peak to the north is the Feuerspitze.  Base and tours  The base for an ascent is the Ansbacher Hut at 2,376 metres. The normal route, the easiest climb, runs either along the north arête, according to the literature at climbing grade II, or up the northeast flank, also at UIAA grade II.

Based on the Tron series, the attraction takes guests on a ride through the Grid on their own light cycle. History The Shanghai Disneyland ride debuted along with the rest of Shanghai Disneyland on June 16, 2016. The Magic Kingdom version of the attraction is planned to be opened during Walt Disney World's 50th Anniversary, which at the earliest would be Fall 2021, but could also open in 2022. It was first announced at the D23 Expo on July 15, 2017 as part of the unveiling of 23 improvements to Disney Parks, including 4 new rides across the theme parks. Design In Shanghai Disneyland, the attraction is located inside, underneath a color-shifting canopy in Tomorrowland. The planned Magic Kingdom port of the attraction will be placed in a completely new section of Tomorrowland to the north of Space Mountain. The Magic Kingdom version's official name was revealed as the Tron Lightcycle Run. The coaster's track takes riders inside and outside the attraction's building, reaching speeds of nearly —the fastest for any Disney roller coaster.

Theological education took an upward rise with the Kretzmann Commission Report. The Kretzmann Commission was enabled with the assistance of the Theological Education Fund of the World Council of Churches and the Board of World Missions of the Lutheran Church in America. The secretary of the Board of Governors, W. D. Coleman, on behalf of the board published 1,000 copies to be circulated among the Churches in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. A couple of years before the Kretzmann Commission was constituted, seminarians deliberated on the church's mission with special reference to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. In 1966, a graduate thesis was undertaken by a candidate studying at Serampore College entitled The Hebrew Concept of 'Righteousness' as proclaimed by the 8th century Prophets and its implications for the Church's mission in Andhra PradeshG.

The members of the commission met at different places for visitation and consultation. As part of field visits, the members had been to, * Hindustan Bible Institute, Chennai * Mennonite Brethren Centenary Bible College, Shamshabad * St. John's Regional Seminary (Theologiate), Ramanthapur * Ramayapatnam Baptist Theological Seminary, Ramayapatnam * Lutheran Bible Training Institute, Rajahmundry In addition, the members of the commission also had special consultations with Canon Emani Sambayya, Dr. P. David and Reveremd Erik W. Nielsen. As for the background material, the commission members accessed scholarly action reports relating to the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church Society, especially the papers of B. V. Subbamma, S. W. Schmitthenner, W. P. Peery and James A. Bergquist, the papers of the Board of Theological Education of the Senate of Serampore College, the National Council of Churches in India and other papers. The commission took cognizance of the concerns of the church in Andhra Pradesh (Telangana included). The commission also devised a structured questionnaire for use among two kinds of respondents, the church leaders and the old students, during field visits. Outcome At the very outset, the commission recommended for Indian teachers to be placed in seminaries to take up theological curriculum, especially for the core subjects in theology. The commission further recommended that theological education broaden its horizons in keeping up with the changing times. Based on the recommendations of the commission, the Andhra Christian Theological College did away with the erstwhile Licentiate in Theology programme and embarked on two graduate programmes, a Bachelor of Theology and a Bachelor of Divinity. As part of the curriculum study, the commission members foresaw the need to include worship, social analysis, interfaith, gender concerns, inculturation, psychology, language usability, personal devotion, sociology and many other interdisciplinary courses. In the ensuing decade, the faculty members were able to upgrade their academics at national and international universities and returned to teach in the college who included, * G. Solomon, Th.M.

He was among the first African Americans to hold public office in Cleveland, Ohio after he was elected as the Republican Justice of the Peace in 1873. He served as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives, and in 1891, he was elected to the Ohio Senate becoming the first African American Senator in the state serving from 1892 to 1893. Green is remembered for introducing the legislation that established Labor Day in Ohio as a state holiday. Early life and education Green was born in New Bern, North Carolina to John Rice Green and Temperance Dirden Green, who were both free persons of color of mixed ancestry. Greene's father was a tailor and his mother was a seamstress. At the age of five, Green and his two sisters were left to the care of their mother when their father died in 1850. Unable to sufficiently provide for her children in North Carolina, Green's mother in 1857 decided to relocate to Cleveland, Ohio, which promised greater educational and economic opportunities. In Cleveland, liberal white community leaders mostly of New England origin encouraged tolerance, racial fairness, and integration even during the antebellum times.Kusmer, Kenneth L. A Ghetto Takes Shape: Black Cleveland, 1870-1930. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1976. In 1865, the Cleveland Leader wrote that, \\"an indication of the civilized spirit of the city of Cleveland is found in the fact that colored children attend our schools, colored people are permitted to attend all public lectures and public affairs where the fashion and culture of the city congregate, and nobody is offended.\\" Cleveland at that time already had a small cadre of prominent black citizens, such as George Peake, land developer and inventor; Madison Tilly, an excavating contractor; Dr. Robert Boyd Leach, a physician; John Brown, the proprietor of the barber shop in one of Cleveland's finest hotels, the New England House; and Freeman H. Morris, an owner of tailoring establishment, among others. However, the largest proportion of African American population of the city (in 1870, the black population of Cleveland was about 1,300, or 1.4% of the 93,000 city dwellers) worked as unskilled laborers and domestic servants. Green attended local grammar and high schools which were already integrated in Cleveland, making parallel efforts to help his struggling family by working odd jobs; he was an errand boy, and in 1862 became a hotel waiter. He continued to study on his own, and in an unusual attempt to secure funds for his further education wrote and published at his own expense a thirty-eight page pamphlet, Miscellaneous Subjects by a Self-Educated Colored Youth (1866).Andrews, William L. Green, John Patterson. In Dictionary of North Carolina Biography, edited by William S. Powell. Vol. 2, D-G, Volume 2, University of North Carolina Press, 1996, pp. 357-358. He sold near 1,500 copies in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. Green completed a four-year classical program at Cleveland Central Catholic High School in two years. He graduated ahead of class becoming a Valedictorian. After high school, Greene enrolled in Ohio State and Union Law College in Cleveland, graduating in 1870.Ohio State and Union Law College, The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History Career Looking for a place to establish a successful legal practice, Green moved with his family, first, to North Carolina, and then, to Bennettsville, South Carolina, where he stayed from 1870 to 1872. On September 20, 1870, Green passed the South Carolina bar and started to practice criminal law. In 1872, Green was elected a delegate to the South Carolina Republican convention where he became an alternate delegate to the National Republican Convention. In the Fall of 1872, Green returned to Cleveland where he was elected as a Justice of the Peace for Cuyahoga County, Ohio by a majority of 3,000 votes; he served three terms deciding close to 12,000 cases.Williams, George W. History of the Negro Race in America from 1619-1880. Vol 2, p. 447. In 1877, he lost a highly contested election to the Ohio House of Representatives by sixty two votes. In 1881 Green ran again, and this time he won. He lost in 1883, but won in 1889. In 1890, he sponsored legislation introducing Labor Day in Ohio as a state holiday. In 1891, Green was elected to the Ohio Senate by mostly white voters. He supported state funding for Wilberforce University, an institution affiliated with the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and helped to defeat attempts to allow local school districts to practice racial segregation. Being a loyal Republican, Green, as a traveling speaker, took an active part in William McKinley's presidential campaign of 1896. His efforts were appreciated and in 1897 he was awarded with a newly created position of U.S. Postage Stamp Agent in Washington D.C. with an annual salary of 2,500, serving in 1897-1905. In 1906, he briefly served as the acting superintendent of finance in the United States Post Office Department. Green was a well regarded criminal attorney in Cleveland with clients coming \\"mostly from the working class of both races.\\"Kenneth L. Kusmer. Green, John Patterson. American National Biography Online, February 2000. In 1897, in a notable case, Green defended in Charleston, West Virginia a black servant who acted in self-defense, but was charged with assault. Later life Green continued to practice the law in his later years, but majorly withdrew from participation in community organizations and activities. In 1920, he finished his autobiography, Fact Stranger than Fiction (1826), which he dedicated to the African American youth.Green, John P. Fact Stranger Than Fiction: Seventy-five Years of a Busy Life, with Reminiscences, of Many Great and Good Men and Women. Cleveland: Riehl Printing Co, 1920. In 1928, Green addressed the Republican National Convention in Chicago asking black voters to support the Republican party. He died an accidental death after being struck by an automobile in Cleveland after stepping down from a streetcar; at the time of his death he was one of the oldest practicing attorneys in Ohio.Cleveland News, 2 September 1940; Cleveland Plain Dealer, 2 September 1940. Green is buried in Woodland Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio. Green was a founding member of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Cleveland.St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History Family Green married Annie Laura Walker Green (1848–1912) after graduation from high school in 1869.

Legacy The Cleveland Leader characterized Green in 1902 as a \\"self-made man\\". After coming to Cleveland at the age of twelve, he used available educational opportunities as a social lift and later employed politics as a tool of upward mobility, eventually becoming a prominent figure in Ohio Republican Party. Green was the second African American to serve in the Ohio House of Representatives and the first to serve in the Ohio Senate in the state history. Along with Charles W. Chesnutt and Harry C. Smith, another conservative African-American community leaders in Cleveland, Green promoted social and cultural integration of black Clevelanders and stood against emerging social and cultural trends of separatism brought about by the changing economic conditions and social attitudes on race in the United States. Similar to Booker T. Washington, he saw the path to racial equality in cultivation of classic American virtues of thrift and perseverance. However, Green is criticized by historians for silence and inactivity during increasing racial oppression and disfranchisement of the African-Americans in the South at the turn of the century, despite having access to many prominent political and social leaders, such as Marcus Alonzo Hanna, William McKinley, and John D. Rockefeller, among others. In Ohio, Green is remembered for introducing a bill to Ohio legislature that established the Labor Day as a state holiday in 1890;Ohio History Central: Labor Day he was dubbed, Ohio's Father of Labor Day.Tall, Booker T.

The film, directed by Stanley Hawes and produced by Stuart Legg, contrasted modern warfare with the First World War. The film's French version title is Sur le front scientifique.  Synopsis  During the First World War, campaigns were frozen into inaction, mired in a trench warfare stalemate that lasted years. During the Second World War, the lessons of the last war were not learned as France built a supposedly \\"impregnable\\" Maginot Line. In 1940, the static Maginot fortifications were easily outflanked by Nazi Germany's rapid mechanized legions. In modern mechanized ground warfare, both Great Britain and Canada learned the principles of tactical warfare and applied them in training and in battle. In Africa, Empire armoured units were successful in traversing large expanses of the Sahara Desert, successfully launching surprise attacks against Axis forces. War has not only become a battle of \\"men and machines\\" but also of \\"brains\\". In Canada, scientists at the National Research Council (NRC), university and industrial laboratories are in the forefront of research. The close relationship of science and warfare is evident when Andrew McNaughton, the former head of the NRC, became the commanding officer of the First Canadian Infantry Division (part of VII Corps). Canadian scientists and technicians use wind tunnels to design aircraft, decompression chambers to help pilots cope with battle at high altitudes, X-rays to test forgings, and create precise measuring instruments to ensure that cannon barrels are made to exacting standards. Science has also been harnessed to create other potent weapons of war such as aircraft and submarines. New technology has been introduced to make weapons more effective including the use of radio direction finders and degaussing apparatus on ships to protect against magnetic mines and torpedoes. With scientists and military tacticians working together, weapons of war have now become more effective and proved the value of \\"the battle of brains\\".

He is described as \\"the first national architect of Wales\\" and the \\"unchallenged master of chapel architecture in Wales in the 1860s\\". Early life Thomas Thomas was born in 1817 and brought up near Ffairfach, at Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire. His father ran a carpentry business, where Thomas worked before moving to Swansea. Religious ministry Though he had no formal training he was appointed as a chapel minister in Clydach in 1848, a post which he held until 1853. Reverend Thomas subsequently became a Congregational minister at Landore, Swansea, until he resigned in 1875. It has been conjectured that he resigned after it was discovered he was the owner of sub- standard workers housing in north Swansea. Architecture Thomas was also known an architect and began designing chapels in 1848 and continued through the chapel-building boom of the 1860s and '70s, designing not only for his own Congregational denomination but for others too. He had redesigned Landore's own Siloh Chapel in 1860. The New Siloh Chapel (1878) in Landore was, however, designed after Thomas's resignation by Thomas Freeman who had been a builder and surveyor of the Reverend Thomas's earlier chapels. Thomas Thomas is credited with at least 119 chapels across Wales. He also made sure he garnered the distinction of preaching the first sermon (or one of the first sermons) at each of his new chapels. His trademark design feature of chapels was the giant arch in the pediment on the facade of his buildings. He also invented the stylistic interior feature of dipping the chapel gallery behind the preacher's pulpit. Later life After resigning as a church minister, Thomas moved to Mumbles. He died there on 16 March 1888 and was buried at Sketty.

It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the last of his eight cenotaphs to be erected in England. Prior to Lutyens' involvement, several abandoned proposals had been made for commemorating Norwich's war dead, and by 1926 the newly elected lord mayor was determined to see the construction of a memorial before he left office. He established an appeal to raise funds for local hospitals in memory of the dead as well as a physical monument. He commissioned Lutyens, who designed an empty tomb (cenotaph) atop a low screen wall from which protrudes a Stone of Remembrance. Bronze flambeaux at either end can burn gas to emit a flame. Lutyens also designed a roll of honour, on which the names of the city's dead are listed, which was installed in Norwich Castle in 1931. A local disabled veteran unveiled the memorial on 9 October 1927. It was moved from its original location to become the centrepiece of a memorial garden between the market and the City Hall in 1938. The structure on which the garden is built was found to be unstable in 2004 and the memorial was closed off pending repairs which began in 2008. The work was completed in 2011, during which time the memorial was restored, having fallen into disrepair while it was closed off, and rotated to face the city hall rather than the market place. It was rededicated on Armistice Day 2011 and is today a grade II* listed building. In 2015, it became part of a \\"national collection\\" of Lutyens' war memorials. Background The Norfolk Regiment was one of the first to enter combat after the declaration of the First World War. The 1st battalion was stationed in Belfast, from where they were dispatched to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force. The 1st Norfolks participated at the Battle of Mons, one of the first major engagements of the war, in late August 1914. The 2nd battalion, based in India, sailed for the Middle East to fight against the Ottoman Empire in Mesopotamia (Iraq).Smith, pp. 18–19. The Norfolks had a third battalion, part of the Territorial Force, which was first deployed for home defence around eastern England, and raised three more pals battalions. Norwich, the county town, raised another three companies of Royal Engineers. Approximately 33,000 men served overseas with the Norfolks, though many more Norfolk men joined other regiments.Smith, p. 50. In the aftermath of the war and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Among the most prominent designers of memorials was Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed The Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations; the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing, the largest British war memorial anywhere in the world; and the Stone of Remembrance, which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens' civic memorials, including Norwich's. Commissioning Norwich was among the last of Lutyens' memorials to be built. Many towns and cities built memorials soon after the end of the First World War, but early attempts in Norwich proved abortive, each mired in controversy. A scheme to build an agricultural college to serve as a memorial reached the point of soliciting donations, but these had to be returned when the scheme was abandoned as being too ambitious and not appealing to all social classes. When Charles Bignold was elected Lord Mayor of Norwich in 1926, he was determined that the city would have a war memorial before he left office. He took the initiative and commissioned Lutyens and the two men selected a site to the east of the Guildhall when the architect visited the city on 13 June 1927. Adamant that the project should benefit the living as well as provide a monument to the dead, Bignold established the Joint Hospitals and War Memorial Appeal to raise funds for the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital and the Jenny Lind Children's Hospital, as well as a physical monument. The target was £35,000, of which £4,000 was to be allocated to a memorial. The memorial would not have space for the names of Norwich's 3,544 war dead, so Lutyens was also commissioned to design the Norwich Roll of Honour. A further £800–£1,000 was allocated and Lutyens produced a set of oak panels which fold out to reveal the names painted on the inside.Skelton, pp. 70–71.Boorman, p. 122. The monument was completed swiftly once the location was agreed; the total cost was £2,700 (1927), of which 10% was Lutyens' fee. The design and the proposed location continued to be a source of controversy in the local community. Some residents felt that the memorial would not be in keeping with the city's existing architecture, but Bignold felt sure that he had the backing of the ex-service community. He noted that the Guildhall was in a central location and as one of Norwich's most famous buildings was a significant attraction for visitors, and thus that siting the memorial there would display Norwich's pride in its contribution to the war. In response to criticisms of the design, he wrote that \\"the form of any war memorial depends entirely on the sum of money available for its construction. Knowing this sum, we consulted Sir Edwin Lutyens as to the best means of expending it. [...] We felt that all reasonable persons would be satisfied by the expert opinion of the man who gave London its Cenotaph\\".Skelton, pp. 71–72. Design The memorial in 2004 The memorial is of Portland stone construction. It consists of a low screen wall on top of which is a tomb chest (cenotaph) topped with a carved wreath, the last of eight cenotaphs by Lutyens to be built in England—the first being Southampton's and the most famous being that on Whitehall in London.Borg, p. 75. The city's coat of arms is carved and painted into the tomb, supported by two relief figures of angels. The memorial is flanked by pedestals, which are topped with bronze flambeaux (flaming torches) gilded with gold leaf. Protruding from the screen wall, beneath the coat of arms, is a Stone of Remembrance, the only one he designed to be integrated into a larger structure.Skelton, p. 71.Corke, p. 57. Built into the structure were two metal caskets, one of which contained a list of Norwich's dead from the war and the contents of the second is unknown; the council decided that it would have been inappropriate to open it during restoration work. The memorial is designed so that gas can be burnt inside it, with the smoke and flames emitted through the flambeaux at either end. Lutyens proposed similar designs for several memorials, including the Cenotaph on Whitehall, but Norwich was the only place where the proposal was accepted and is thus the only one of his memorials capable of emitting a flame.Skelton, pp. 73, 174. The inscriptions read (above the stone) and (on the stone itself). A further inscription in smaller font on the base of the stone reads . This was added at a later date, along with the dates of the two world wars which are inscribed on the screen wall, either side of the stone. The roll of honour was not completed as quickly. After a series of budget reductions, it was delivered in June 1929 but was of poor quality, and in the meantime the trustees of the castle museum had decided that the castle was not an appropriate place for the roll to be kept. It had also exceeded the reduced budget of £500, though Lutyens waived his fee and offered to pay the difference. The trustees changed their minds after improvements were made to the quality, and the roll of honour was installed in the castle on 13 January 1931 without ceremony as a result of embarrassment over the delay.Skelton, p. 73. History General Sir Ian Hamilton presided over the memorial's unveiling on Sunday, 9 October 1927, at a ceremony attended by Lutyens. The unveiling itself was performed by a local veteran, Bertie Withers. Withers was selected at random after candidates were solicited from the city's ex-servicemen who met four criteria: that they were natives of Norwich; had enlisted prior to the implementation of conscription in 1916; had served overseas; and had been permanently disabled as a result of their service. Withers enlisted on 1 September 1914 and fought in the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915; after a bout of illness he rejoined his unit to fight in the First Battle of Gaza, where his battalion suffered heavy casualties. Withers himself was injured and, after his evacuation, his left leg was amputated below the knee. Upon his return to England he spent a year in the Norwich and Norfolk Hospital.Skelton, pp. 72–73.Smith, p. 137. As part of civic redevelopment of the market area and surrounding buildings in 1938, the cenotaph was moved to a site on Market Place, between the new City Hall and the castle. There it formed the centrepiece of a dedicated memorial garden by C.H. James and S.R. Pierce. The garden was opened by King George VI on 29 October 1938. The whole monument now stands on a terrace which runs parallel to the city hall, sloping towards Market Place with steps accommodating the gradient. A row of eight ornamental lamp-posts stands along either side of the memorial itself, one of which is a later replacement. Two flagpoles stand at the corners, at the bases of which are low relief brass carvings of allegorical figures of Peace and Plenty.Pevsner, p. 313. The memorial seen in 2011, following restoration work. It used to stand before the Norwich Guildhall which is the flint-faced building to the left Structural problems with the undercroft of the garden were discovered in the early 21st century and the garden was closed and fenced off in 2004. The memorial remained fenced off for seven years and fell into disrepair as the city council lacked the funds to carry out the necessary repairs, though access was granted to representatives of the Royal British Legion to lay wreaths during Remembrance Sunday services. The journalist Martin Bell remarked on the condition of the memorial in 2007: \\"to find a war memorial in a state like that you would have to go to Iraq\\".Skelton, p. 159. Repair work commenced on the garden and undercroft in early 2008—the beams and columns supporting the terrace having become dangerously weak—and was scheduled to take three years to complete. The council commissioned NPS Architectural Group to oversee restoration and work on the memorial itself started in September 2009; the council initially hoped that the project would be complete by Armistice Day 2010. During the repair work the memorial itself was rotated to face the city hall, in accordance with the wishes of local veterans to allow them easier access for parades, and underwent minor restoration work. Its place in the memorial garden was taken by a new bronze sculpture: Breath by Paul de Monchaux. The garden re-opened to the public in March 2011. The memorial and garden was re-dedicated after three years on Armistice Day, 11 November 2011; the repair work had cost £2.6 million. The roll of honour suffered structural damage, and in 2016 was moved from the castle keep to the city hall. It was restored with the aid of grant funding from the War Memorials Trust and several local charities. Two commemorative stones were laid in front of the memorial in August 2017 in honour of two men from Norwich who received the Victoria Cross (the highest award for gallantry in the British armed forces) in the First World War—Corporal Sidney James Day and Major Wilfred Edwards, who both earned their medals in August 1917. A third stone is planned to be laid in 2018 for Lance Corporal Ernest Seaman, the third and final Norwich-born recipient of the Victoria Cross, a century after the action for which he was decorated. Norwich War Memorial was designated a Grade II listed building on 30 September 1983; it was upgraded to Grade II* in 2014. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Historic England recognised it as part of a \\"national collection\\" of Lutyens' war memorials. At the same time, all 44 of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed, and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.

He was a Lorrain painter by birth and was born the year Fauvism appeared at the Salon d'automne. He became a Parisian painter when he studied under Lucien Simon at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, through his adventures in the \\"zone\\",The « zone » was the name commonly used for the « zone non aedificandi » an area where the ring road around Paris was built but which in the 1920s was occupied by gardens and military huts. setting up several studios before finally settling in the Île Saint-Louis at 15 quai d'Anjou. He was also a Provençal painter since he spent time in Provence following in the steps of Cézanne and Van Gogh in the 1930s and set up his last studio in Aurel, Vaucluse. He can also be considered a painter from Normandy where he was drawn by his friends Jean Jardin and Edmond Duchesne and where he bought a house for his family in 1936. From 1953 to 1973 he was the curator of the Eugène Boudin Museum in Honfleur which still has some of his works on display. As Jean Dries believed that art transcended national borders he never stopped travelling outside of France and even Europe. His admiration for Spanish and Italian masters led him to Spain and Italy. He taught art at the French colonial school in Sétif (Algeria) for a few months and was sent by the French government to Mendoza (Argentina) in the spring of 1940 to set up pictorial art studies at the University of Cuyo and to promote French culture. Esthetically, he proclaimed himself to be totally independent. Starting in 1928 he exhibited in various Parisian Salons – Salon d'automne, Salon des Tuileries, Salon des indépendants – and steadfastly refused to be part of any school, style or genre. He painted landscapes, portraits, self-portraits, nudes, still lifes, seascapes, horse races and bullfights. Although tempted by Impressionism, Cubism and especially Fauvism, he never gave into abstraction or non-figurative art. In his Blue Notebook he wrote \\"One cannot do without nature. One must neither torture it or oneself.\\"Jean Dries, blue notebook (cahier bleu), p.75. This blue notebook, found after his death, and written probably in 1956 contains hand-written notes by Dries covering the period from 1905 to 1950. It was edited in 1983 by the Musée de Bar-le-Duc under the title « Jean Dries ». He was a great colorist while remaining attentive to the balance of composition. It has been said of him that he was a \\"fauve Cézanne\\".Janine Warnod in the catalogue of Jean Dries works exposed in the Musée Eugène Boudin, p.5 Biography Nothing in his family background predisposed Jean Driesbach to become a painter. His mother's family (from Lorraine and Franche-Comté) had no ties to the art world. His paternal grandparents who had been wine growers near Colmar in the Haut-Rhin decided to leave Alsace in 1871 to remain French and had settled in Bar-le-Duc where his father was a bailiff. Jean Dries successfully completed his secondary studies despite two interruptions due to the war. The German advances in 1914-15 and in 1917-18 forced the family to seek refuge near Granville (Manche) in Normandy. This was where Dries first tried his hand at drawing and first saw the sea: \\"Deeply moved by the sea, played among the rocks, the port of Granville\\" he wrote.Blue notebook, p.5 1921 was a turning point in his life. His father died after a long illness and he was forced to work for the master glass-maker GambutThe studio Gambut, rue des Ducs was short-lived but left a lasting impression on the young Dries and his later work. to help his family. He himself had a serious spinal injury (it immobilized him in a plaster cast for 8 months) and from which he suffered for the rest of his life. \\"I pass the time painting still-lifes and portraits.\\" His talent came to the attention of his friend the future engraver Paul Lemagny and was encouraged by his philosophy teacher, Pierre Salzi, who introduced him to the painter Jules- Emile Zingg. =The formative years 1926-1930= With the financial help of the alumni association of the lycée in Bar-le-Duc (200F) and the town (800F) as well as a loan on trust from the Meuse department, Jean Driesbach left Lorraine for Paris. There he studied at the Ecole des Beaux arts in the Laguillermie and Lucien Simon studios.Blue notebook p.9 He soon got a room at the Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris where he made many friends and discovered music. \\"That's where I first heard Beethoven and Mozart\\".Blue notebook p. 10 At the school he made some lifelong friends, including Paul Arzens. At this time out of financial necessity he painted doll faces and bonbonnieres. Work In Paris Jean Driesbach, who was starting to be called Jean Dries, attended the Ecole Nationale des Beaux Arts but also the art academies in Montparnasse where he drew a great deal. He also went to museums where he was very \\"impressed by Courbet and Cézanne.\\"Blue notebook, p.11 Looking for nature to paint, he explored the outskirts of Paris, the banks of the Seine, the \\"zone\\", Saint-Cloud and Ville d'Avray.« On July 18th, 1930, Lucien Simon reports on the progress his pupil is making on works done… outside of school. » (email from E. Schwartz, archivist at the ENSBA dated June 1st, 2012) His drawing talent was recognized in 1926 when he won first prize for a live model in modern dress for Un franciscainReproduced plate XCI in La Grande Masse January 1927 and in 1927 he obtained a teaching certificate for drawing. Holidays During the holidays at home in Bar-le-Duc Jean Dries painted the countryside (Les bords de l'Ornain, La forêt de Massonges), tried his hand at portraits (his two sisters) and also his first large scale compositions: Trois nus dans un paysage (1927), and Le déjeuner en forêt (1928) \\"Painting has never given me so much pleasure\\" he wrote.Blue notebook p.17 He also made his first journeys. In 1928 he traveled through Auvergne and the South of France (Avignon and Nîmes). It was however his trip in February 1929 to Cassis which made the deepest impression on him, \\"a marvelous journey, my dearest memory\\".Blue notebook p.19 While studying in London at the Institut de France in February–March 1929, he met Jean Jardin who would become his lifelong friend. Together they discovered the British Museum, the National Gallery and Dutch painting (Rembrandt, Van Gogh).Pierre Assouline, Une éminence grise, p.31-32 Finally in 1930 with another close friend, Alexandre Marc-Lipianski, he visited Spain: its landscapes and of course its museums, \\"What emotion Velasquez and Goya inspire\\".Blue notebook p. 21 =Setting up as an artist= Early recognition In 1928, while still a student, Dries exhibited his first large-scale paintings at the Salon d'Automne and at the Salon des Indépendants and in 1931 when just 26 he exhibited L'Atelier which he had painted the year before. These submissions drew the attention of the criticsSee for example the articles concerning the Salons from 1928 to 1931 by Néhac in L'Est Républicain or by Thiébault-Sisson in Le Temps who devoted long articles to his work: in November 1932 Thiébault-Sisson wrote in Le Temps \\"Dries is a born painter and I know of few talents as promising as his.\\"Thiébault-Sisson, Le Temps, Nov. 11, 1931 n° 25646 p. 3, col. 1,2 In 1929 his first individual exhibition was hung in the staircase of the Comédie des Champs-Elysées (47 paintings and watercolours) and for the first time in 1930 the French Government bought one of his paintings: Sous-bois dans la Meuse. Recognized by critics, appreciated by private and public collectors, in 1936 Dries was acknowledged by his peers when he met the painter Vlaminck who asked to see some of his work and ended the visit with these words \\"The carp's not bad. You're a painter.\\"Vlaminck's visit is recorded in detail in the Blue notebook p.37-39. Paris and Honfleur In 1930 he set up in Paris near the Porte d'Orléans and had his mother and two sisters join him. At the same time he bought a house for them in Honfleur, where they lived until 1961. He had been drawn there by his friends Jean Jardin and Edmond Duchesne, but for someone who was in love with the South of France the first contact was difficult, “Everything seemed lackluster and listless... It would take me years to get over this distaste, to become aware of the delicacy of the landscapes of northwestern France, the cradle of impressionism.”Blue notebook P. 25 He continued to travel in late 1935 to take up a teaching position at the colonial school in Sétif Algeria. Disappointed by the few months he spent there he came back with only a few sketches, “I was disoriented by orientalism” he decided.Blue notebook p. 35 He was more inspired by the trips he made to Italy and Switzerland (1932) and to Spain where he spent two weeks in Cadaquès, “I sometimes met the painter Salvador Dali. He had a house there and shocked the locals by the way he dressed.”Blue notebook p. 27 A long journey in 1937 in particular took him to Cassis, Arles and Saint-Rémy-de- Provence in memory of Van Gogh. He also went to Tuscany and Rome to see his friend Paul Lemagny and discovered Corot's landscapes. In 1938 he had a major retrospective exhibition at the Charpentier Gallery including 84 paintings and 21 watercolors covering this period. =Maturity 1938-1964= At 33 Dries was a recognized artist, exhibiting regularly in shows and art galleries. His works were bought by private collectors, the City of Paris and the French government. He had houses and studios in Paris and Honfleur. World War II and the years following It was in December 1938 as a grant holder at the Abbaye de Royaumont near Paris that he met “Mlle Rosset, an excellent musician”Blue notebook p. 45-47; A student of Cortot's, Henriette Rosset-Dries gave up her career as a musician to help her husband in his career as an artist. who became his wife on November 11, 1939 and was thereafter his favorite model. When the war broke out they were in Provence where Dries was a resident at the Laurent-Vibert Foundation. As his state of health precluded his being mobilised, he was at first posted as an art teacher to the Parisian Lycée Carnot which had been sent to Normandy for safety reasons. He was again disappointed by the experience. “I've got better things to do”Blue notebook p. 47 he wrote in December of that year. The French government then sent him to Argentina to Mendoza where at Cuyo University he organized painting classes and his wife taught music. It was during the stopover in Rio that they learned of the defeat of France in the spring of 1940. In Argentina and Chile Dries found new landscapes to paint, interested students and new friends, the engraver Victor Delhez and the opera singer Jane Bathori, but was overwhelmed by sadness and worry for his family back in France. In spite of the offer of a five-year contract and the success of his exhibition in Buenos Aires presented by Margarita Abella Caprile, the Dries decided to return to France. They boarded ship December 4, 1941, three days before navigation became impossible after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7. On the way back the Portuguese Minister of Propaganda invited them to stop in Lisbon where Dries exhibited a few paintings, “unexpectedly successful, …enthusiastic press coverage, lots of buyers”Blue notebook p. 57 before reaching Paris in the spring of 1942. They found an apartment at 15 quai d’Anjou on Île Saint-Louis which became his ‘haven’ of choice and his studio until he died. He spent time in Paris, Honfleur and the South of France and his painting went in a new direction which would last several years. He began work on two paintings which would become recognized as two of his major works: Le portrait de la mère de l’artiste and especially Paris, 25 août 1944, \\"a nude woman leaning over a balcony where flags are waving. She symbolizes Paris at long last free.\\"Blue notebook p. 61 The use of highly contrasting colours, the red outline around forms marks the beginning of what some have called 'the red period'. After the war Dries began travelling again, in 1947 to Italy and Switzerland and Provence (where the Laurent-Vibert foundation offered him a second residency, the first having been cut short by the war), in 1948 to London and in 1949 to Mallorca in Spain. That same year their son Sebastien joined the family and inspired the artist with new themes.See the catalogue of the exposition « Enfants d'Artistes » which took place in Condé-sur-Noireau (Calvados) in 2011-2012 After the Blue Notebook (1950-1964) The Blue Notebook, in which Dries jotted down his artistic reflections, ended in 1950. He was probably too taken up by his work, family life and as curator at the Eugène Boudin Museum in Honfleur. He received many orders for paintings: two for the Chamber of Commerce in Caen in 1948, the Cité Universitaire in Paris (Victor Lyon Foundation) in 1950, the Middle SchoolOiseaux des marais painting deposited in 2011 at the Musée de Honfleur. and the Chamber of Commerce of Honfleur in 1958, the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique for the ore carrier Lens in 1959 and most importantly for the Flandres suite on the liner France in 1961.Environs de Bergues, reproduced in Daniel-Rops, DRIES, plate 49 He tried his hand at lithography (only two works: Bassin de la Gare à Honfleur and Le Jockey,1956) and at illustrating (La Sainte Vehme de Pierre Benoit published in 1969 by Albin Michel). His main occupation however was painting for himself. He took his inspiration from studies done during his travels (Le Vallon à Menton in 1960 or Le Port de Saint-Tropez in 1958 and San Giorgio Maggiore Venice in 1957), horse races, and seascapes (Le Bonheur à Deauville in 1955).Painting deposited by the French nation in the museum of Grenoble. But more and more of his time was taken up by two other activities. He co- founded the Société des Artistes Honfleurais, which for fifty years organized an annual show.See the booklet edited in 2001 for the fiftieth anniversary of the association: La Société des artistes honfleurais. And in 1950 he became the assistant to Voisard-Margerie, the curator of the municipal Honfleur Museum from whom he took over in 1953.Georges Poisson, Inspector General of Fine Arts, wrote several pages on Dries as a curator which were published in Jean Dries published by Junès et fils. These activities were time-consuming and took a toll on his health. His work as a painter was crowned in 1958 by the Grand Prix for painting awarded by the city of Paris and the first prize in painting delivered by the town of Montrouge in 1962.Paris Normandie, December 1st ,1962 That same year his endeavours on behalf of art were acknowledged by the French Government when he was named chevalier of the Légion d'Honneur. =The last ten years (1964-1973)= Despite his failing health, he opened a new studio in Aurel (Vaucluse). He was attracted there by his love for Mediterranean landscapes and by his friend, the painter Pierre Ambrogiani, whose work was exhibited in the same Parisian art gallery as Dries. Charmed by the village and the surroundings which reminded him of Sétif, he returned there every summer to soak up the atmosphere of the solidly structured landscapes dear to Cézanne and the vibrant colours associated with fauvism. But the museum in Honfleur took up too much time: he was sometimes forced to leave the South to oversee the work on the addition to the museum which began in 1972. When returning from a visit to the construction site he was struck down by a heart attack in his Parisian flat on February 26, 1973. He left unfinished his final work, Montagne de la Sainte-Victoire, an ultimate tribute to Cézanne, the master of Aix. Works =A little known artist= \\"Jean Dries, a secretive man\\"Janine Warnod, in Jean Dries, catalogue of the works exposed at the Musée Eugène Boudin, p, 5 He talked little about his art, except in his Blue Notebook (Cahier Bleu) which ended in 1950. The only publication which covers his work extensively is Jean Dries which was published in 1979 by Junès et fils and even that is not really an academic study. It is therefore difficult to present succinctly such a varied production where the only documentation consists of numerous articles in the press. =Some permanent traits= Independence He belonged to no school. \\"I am not at all impressed by schools. I do my own work. I try to express myself as sincerely and as completely as possible.\\"Dries's response to François Pluchart in Combat March 14th, 1962. He has, however, sometimes been associated with the École de Paris« Next Saturday… a jury composed of painters from the Ecole de Paris: Dries, Grau-Sala, Sébire will select a number of works », Paris Normandie, Caen edition, September 14th, 1962. or with a group called the \\"peintres de l'Estuaire\\"See L'univers d'un peintre, presentation realized by Luc Verdier for an exposition in Honfleur in 1995. who were an informal group with no other common bond than an affection for Honfleur and the Seine estuary. He felt totally free in the choice of his subjects. In 1962 Daniel-Rops said \\"What did he paint? What he saw ...anything at all.\\"Daniel- Rops, DRIES, p.8. \\"He was an open admirer of the Normandy landscape, buxom nudes and wholesome earthly pleasures.\\"Les Nouvelles littéraires, June 3rd, 1965. Dries tried his hand at landscapes (of Normandy and elsewhere), nudes, still lives, portraits, seascapes, horse races, and large-scale compositions. No subject left him indifferent. High standards Dries \\"is constantly seeking, he's never satisfied, he's always evolving.\\"J.J. Herbert, in Le Lion (official publication of Lions International) n°28 March 1957, p.12 \\"I'm working on a big painting that I call Concert Champêtre... I'm sending it to the Tuileries, but I'm not very satisfied with it.\\"Blue notebook, p.31 This dissatisfaction explains why many of his paintings weren't signed. He only signed paintings he was going to exhibit or sell. To his way of thinking, a painting was never completed and he could always alter it. Dries didn't hesitate to destroy paintings he wasn't satisfied with. In 1956 he estimated that he had “done about 1100 paintings including 300 or so which had been destroyed by the artist.”In Les cahiers d'art-documents, documentation put together by Jean Albert Cartier, p. 10. Constant evolution Even once he reached maturity Dries never stopped exploring new paths, \\"What's important to me is the structure of the composition. I always return to the same themes, but treat them differently depending on what I am experimenting with at the time.\\" This diversity makes it difficult to classify the artist and his works in a narrowly defined category. There are nonetheless certain permanent preoccupations: \\"You can't do without nature\\"Blue notebook p.75 As Jean Bouret said, \\"Somebody's going to say 'How realistic it all is', and I, of course, am going to have a fit, because Dries doesn't describe the object (he's painting), but transforms it into an object that has been plunged into a very different world, because he is a true painter.\\"Jean Bouret, in his presentation of the catalogue of the Dries exhibit at the Monique de Groote Gallery, Paris, May 1953 According to Clément Rosset \\"The privilege of the painter is to render palpable the singularity of all that exists, its foreignness and its solitude.\\"Clément Rosset, in Jean Dries, Ed. Junès et fils. So he rejected abstract art, was faithful to nature, but to a nature transposed. He was also faithful to certain masters seen in museums (Courbet, Cézanne) or studios (Favory). Lastly memories of his childhood in Lorraine and outings in the forests of the Meuse influenced his palette giving it \\"pure tones dominated by blues and greens. And the use of earthy hues and black.\\" =An attempt at a chronology= A history of the works by Dries is possible, based on his all too rare writings on the subject, but also difficult as he seldom hesitated to rework old paintings according to his current experiments and state of mind. Early works Well into the 1930s Dries was still trying to find himself. And although the critics had already recognized his talent he was sometimes reproached for not mastering composition« A pile of still-lifes … which are only there to plug up the holes ». Thiébault-Sisson in Le Temps, November 1932. or for letting himself be too influenced by his contemporaries.« The nude is powerful, but … vulgar with its reddish shadow effect borrowed from Favory's palette » Thiébault-Sisson, Le Temps, November 12, 1931. Nonetheless his first paintings already exhibit a certain originality as can be seen in his first self-portrait.(Autoportrait 1926) The impact of his first trips Discovering the Midi and the intense light of the south of France created a shock that altered his way of seeing and his style: \\"I'm seeing Cézanne's motifs and am literally enchanted\\"In Cassis, near Marseilles \\"Is it my travels in Spain, the light in the South? I'm going to have to take care to make my tones lighter and warmer\\" Le chemin à Cassis (1933) comes from this period. His \\"Impressionist\\" phase This attention to light, reinforced by his first difficult contact with Honfleur and by his desire to hold on to what he thought defined French art, especially after the defeat of 1940, drove him to experiment briefly with impressionism. \\"At Lourmarin (1939)… studying the problem of light when painting outdoors drew me inevitably closer to the impressionists. I knew it was just an experiment, but I threw myself into it.\\"Blue notebook p.59 Le jardin d'Honfleur dates from this period. It's noteworthy that paradoxically Dries fails to mention the names of any impressionists in his Blue notebook. His \\"Red\\" period Dries's work in the period 1943-1944 opened a highly original chapter in his aesthetic thinking. \\"In May 1943 I started work on a painting of the Liberation that I would later call Paris, 25 août 1944… the red outline is very sustained (heavy). The oranges and reds contrast with the dark blues, the transition is made of lilac tones and greens.\\" At this time, like the fauve painters, Dries exalted colour to the utmost. \\"It's a very cerebral [work] of pure artistry.\\"Blue notebook p. 67 where sometimes, in his use of pure solid colours, in the red or black outlines, the artist was without doubt inspired by his memories of time spent working in the workshop of the master glassmaker Gambut. This is noticeable in Le paysage dans la colline of 1947. But this cerebral work, though undoubtedly necessary, is dangerous: \\"this cerebral work which dictates colour arrangements leads to decoration and abstraction. What is decorative is poor and artificial.\\" A return to reason? (1950–1960) Jean Dries went back to a more classical style to the relief of certain art critics shocked by his \\"red\\" period.« The memories of Cézanne (his god), of Fauvism, the violence, the outrage gave way to force and to the blossoming of his own personality », in le Hors Cote, April 10th, 1962. \\"In August – September [1948] I felt an imperious need to go back to painting landscapes outdoors.\\" His palette became less extreme and returned to the greens, blues and earthy hues which had been forsaken during the red period. Most of his horse race paintings and works like Le ruisseau de montagne (1960) are from this period. Back to the south of France (1960–1973) Dries spent the free time 'his' Honfleur museum left him in the house he bought in Aurel in the Vaucluse. He went back to the colours of the south and his palette became lighter but in a more serene and peaceful style that he will maintain until his sudden disappearance in 1973. \\"Now the paint gives life to tone as well as the form in such a way that for Dries, a patient man, paint, colour and form are of equal importance.\\"Jean Chabanon, in Le Peintre , January 15th, 1957, p. 14 This can be seen in his last works of which Le plateau d'Albion (1970) is an example.

Hering's law of visual direction describes the perceived visual direction of a point relative to an observer. Because the eyes are horizontally apart in the head, by about 6cm, the visual scene is seen from slightly different point of view by each eye. Thus comes the question of where a point is perceived, relative to the observer, when seen with either eye alone or binocularly. In 1879 Ewald Hering stated the following law: \\"For any given two corresponding lines of direction, or visual lines, there is in visual space a single visual direction upon which appears everything which actually lies in the pair of visual lines\\". Prior to Hering, both Alhazen (1021) and Wells (1792) addressed a similar questions but proposed slightly incorrect laws. Hering's law can be simplified as (1) points falling on the same visual line seem to come from the same location; (2) visual directions are relative to the a unique egocenter (also called cyclopean eye) and (3) the perceived direction of a cyclopean line is the line that intersects the point of fixation. In other words, when seen monocularly a point appears in the direction of that point relative to the eye, but as if seen from the egocenter. Hering proposed a simple demonstration of his law. When one fixates a point straight ahead on a window, one might see, through transparency, a different object in each eye aligned with the fixation point. For example in the right eye a house is seen behind the fixation point through the window. The house will appear to be located on the left. In the left eye a tree is seen behind the fixation through the window, appearing to be located on the right. When both eyes look at the fixation point, the house and the tree will appear superimposed in the cyclopean image, however the perceived location of these two superimposed images will be straight ahead. This demonstrates that the perceived location of a point is influenced by its location in both eyes and is relative to an imaginary cyclopean eye (or egocenter). Hering's window demonstration of his law of visual direction. Both eyes fixate a point on the widow. The right eye sees Captain Haddock's curses book behind the fixation, the left eye sees the French press behind the fixation point. With both eyes open and fixating the book and the French press appear superimposed and straight ahead.

The castle of Algoso is one of the most important medieval fortifications in the eastern Trás-os-montes, related with the battles of Leonese succession, the tentative policies of the independent Portuguese monarch and the important religious commandery of the Knights Hospitaller that established their roots in 1224.Texieira (2004) History A view of the landscape surrounding the medieval castle and keep A distant perspective of the castle as its situated on the mountaintop Archaeological excavations permit conclusions associated with early settlement before the Middle Ages, there existed a castle on the current site, that supported various settlements, identified with the Chalcolithic period (that include Bronze Age moulds), proto-historic and Roman (such as the discovery of ceramics associated with a period of non-military settlement).Arguello (2004), p.195-196 =Medieval= During the Christian Reconquista, the primitive frontier of the County of Portugal with the Kingdom of León extended along the left bank of the Sabor River, to its confluence with the Angueira River. This link was watched by various sentinel outposts: the Castle of Milhão, the Castle of Santulhão (both today long disappeared), the Castle of Outeiro de Miranda (in ruins) and in the eastern edge, the Castle of Algoso. The remainder of the principal defense occurred in the northwest, across the protector of the Castles of Penas Róias, Mogadouro and Bragança. Sometime during the 12th century, D. Mendo Rufino (or Bofino), master of the lands of \\"Ulgoso\\" by donation of D. Afonso Henriques, ordered the construction of a fortress, in order to watch and guard the frontier with the Kingdom of León. From information during the 1258 Inquirições, Mendo Rufino (who was one of the supporters of Afonso Henriques against D. Teresa) constructed the castle in exchange for the village of Vimioso. During this period of uncertainty that is the transition between Afonso Henriques reign as first Portuguese monarch, and the exercise of regal power by Sancho I, the castle became an important link with loyal nobility, which had ties to the corte of León, but harboured loyalties with the Portuguese.Ricardo Jorge Coelho Marques Abrantes Teixeira (2004), p.179 As the \\"head\\" of the Terra da Miranda, Algoso was an important fortress; a \\"nuclear point of support with the regal authority\\" in this peripheric region.Ricardo Jorge Coelho Marques Abrantes Teixeira (2004), p.181 Unfortunately, little remains of the early construction, although it assumed that the castle was built on the Romanesque principals of the time, that included a keep tower surrounded by a walled fortification and battlements. Yet, little remains to suggest that was the case, since no archaeological surveys are related with this period,Ricardo Jorge Coelho Marques Abrantes Teixeira (2004), p.185 and that many of the 12th century fragments may have been swept away by events in the subsequent years.Arguello (2004), p.196 Between the 12th and 13th century, the alcaide offered the castle to King D. Sancho I, who compensated his captain, by offering him the title of master of Vimioso, which was conferred on Mendo Rufino. The King planned of transforming Algoso into the centre of his vast territory, encompassing the area of Miranda do Douro and Penas Róias. But, between 1212 and 1213, the lands were invaded by troops loyal to the King of León, Alfonso IX, as a reprisal for the contestation of the Portuguese King against the donations of his sisters. Following a period of turmoil, in 1219, peace was brokered between the Kingdoms of León and Portugal. In April 1224, the primitive structure was radically altered. That year (or just before it)Ricardo Jorge Coelho Marques Abrantes Teixeira (2004), p.182 the castle was donated by King Sancho II to the Knights Hospitaller, after a long period of war with the Kingdom of León. At that time, the expansion of regal authority in the Trás-os-Montes Province privileged the creation of new towns, of an urban character, and relegating the existing castles into defensive military structures that expressed regal authority in the lands of Miranda and Pena Roias. The castle with \\"all its terms and belongings\\" were extended, therefore, to prior D. Rui Pais and his \\"successors, brother monks\\". The town and municipality of Ylgoso, Ulgoso ou São Sebastião de Algoso, was part of the bishopric and district of Bragança. In 1230, the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller came to a concordat in Coimbra, over various lands held between them, including Ylgoso (Algoso), Vila Chã, Atenor, Penas Róias, Paradela and others, outside the bishopric of Bragança. On 22 June 1239, D. Pedro Costem, commander of the Order of the Temple established his commandery of Mogadouro and Pena Roias, that included Algoso. But, later, on 13 February 1291, King D. Dinis (1279-1325) reestablished in Coimbra, that D. Fernão Peres (o Mossejo), would hold the commandery of Algoso and other lands within its range. These changes had an effect on the annual rents paid by their commander: between 7000 and 8000 cruzados, including products from the abbeys of Travanca, Sendim, Vilar Seco, Duas Igrejas and Guide. The castle, therefore, became a focus of a primitive church, dedicated to Nossa Senhora da Assunção(Our Lady of the Assumption), but became known as Our Lady of the Castle by peasantry and gentry. In the hands of the Hospitaller monks, the castle was transformed into a Gothic fortress, characterized by an active defense policy. During this period the heptagonal keep tower was constructed, in order to better resist attacks and providing a more adequate availability of angles to inflict damage on aggressors. This included vertical attacks, with the existence of machicolations over the entranceway and that served as the residence of the commander. During the 1258 Inquirições, the castle was referenced as in a donation to the Knights Hospitaller, by name of D. Afonso Henriques or D. Sancho II. The commander of the Order, Father Pedro Lourenço, in 1291, appeared in a dispute between the King (then D. Dinis) and the Knights Hospitaller; in this dispute the Knights Hospitaller and Command of Ulgoso were united in their afront of the King, and included the villages of Serapicos, Vila Chã da Beira, Uva, Mora, Saldanha, Sendim, Picote, Vilar Seco, Vinhão and couples of Cerceo. Seven years later, D. Dinis ordered the reconstruction of the fortress. In August 1341, a sentence from King D. Afonso IV informed that, in that year, Father D. Álvaro Gonçalves Pereira was the \\"Prior of Hospital in his kingdoms, that he pertained to the Castle of Ulgoso with its term since time in memorial\\". In 1480, King D. Afonso V signed a foral (charter) for the settlement, which was later conceded by King D. Manuel I in 1510. By 1530, the castle included cisterns and residences, but that only the alcaide resided in the building.Gomes (2003), p.148 During the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580, Diogo Fernandes de Almeida (the alcaide of the castle) took sides with the António, Prior of Crato. On his accession to the throne of Portugal, Philip I favoured and conceded privileges on municipality of Algoso (1 January 1592), putting the castle authority and noble's allegiance into question. In 1588, though, Friar Gonçalo de Azevedo, a Knight Hospitaller, and son of Diogo Almeida, was nominated by King Philip I, to act as alcaide and commander at the castle. But, this period of interrupted authority would have an effect on the importance of the fortification. It is unclear of the state of the fortifications during the intervening years, such that by the 17th century, the castle was already abandoned, and the settlement of Algoso took on a larger role in regional authority. On 22 June 1684, the archive of the commandery of Algoso included a description of the furniture and state of conservation of the castle, but the structures were abandoned and in a state of ruin. By 1684, there were many military structures abandoned or ruined within the kingdom. At the end of the Seven Years' War, following the sack of Miranda do Douro in 1762, the Spanish plundered many of the villages and buildings of Vimioso. Garrisoned by a small contingent, under the command of an ensign, the town of Algoso resisted Spanish troops. Much later, the military government was exercised by a captain, sergeant and four ordenanças captains. During that time, between 1689 and 1690, the municipality of Vimioso attempted work to consolidate and restore the structure. The last occupation by military forces occurred in 1710, during the War of Spanish Succession. During the Peninsular War, the judge of Algoso, Jacinto de Oliveira Castelo Branco, refused to accept French sovereignty and, even after the Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil, following the French declaration of the extinction of the Bragança Dynasty, continued to use the titles of privilege conferred on his family. By the middle of the 19th century, Algoso was integrated into the municipality of Vimioso (1855). =20th century= In June 1944, the municipality requested the DGEMN perform work on the property. In June 1974 it was necessary to unobstruct the tower, consolidate the masonry walls and reinforce the vaulted ceilings. The principal tower and cistern were cleared and renovated during this time, but further work on the walls was needed in the intervening years, that included the consolidation of various points with schist masonry and clay cement and sand. At this time, there was an effort to raise the battlements along the southern and eastern walls. This was followed in 1977 by conservation of the walls and battlements, including consolidation of the access stairs to the castle. The battlements along various points (eastern, near the cistern and southeast) were carried out to prevent landslides. Excess vegetation was cleared from within the walls, opening up the spaces for future observation. On 1 June 1992, the property became the responsibility of the Instituto Português do Património Arquitetónico (Portuguese Institute for Architectural Patrimony), by decree law 106F/92 (Diário da República, Série 1A, 126). From 1999 the IPPAR began refurbishing and upkeep on the castle, including requalifying the zone around the castle, with repaving, the addition of stone bunks along the south wall, exterior illumination, resurfacing the roadway to the castle, installation of metal rails for the staircase, cleaning of the cistern and correcting irregularities in the structure. Similar projects were carried out in 2000 (such as weather treatment, consolidation of tower and ceilings), while excavations were carried out within the structure beginning in 2001.Paulo Amaral (2004), p. 175-177Paulo Anes (2004), p.198-205 A protocol was signed in 2002 between the municipality of Vimioso and the IPPAR to transform the property into a museum, resulting in the construction of an interpretative centre in 2006 by the IPPAR. Architecture A view of the escarpment of Cabeço da Penenciada The castle is situated in a rural countryside, isolated on a soft escarpment above sea level, called the Cabeço da Penenciada overlooking the right margin of the Angueira River. The stone castle is designed in a rectangular layout, with corbel walls and a three-story square keep tower with a Gothic access doorway; the superior accessway in similar pointed arch and machicolations, is crowned by merlons with arrowslits. In addition to rectangular cistern, with vaulted interior, the castle includes a primitive military square. The remnants of the small rock castle and few lines of wall fortifications are interrupted by stones and cliff faces, approximately tall. In addition to its keep tower, the walls include a few cubelos (circular towers) and small \\"patio\\" area that functioned as a small military square. On the wall is a square cubelo and in the north, a doorway with frame of arches protected by barbican with similar cubelos lacking bastions. The keep tower, constructed in an irregular polygonal shape, includes large stone corners, and was constructed three-floors high. The Gothic second floor doorway includes a frame and remnants of machicolations. Within the tower are vestiges of the three floors, with the first two used as residences and the last for defense (as evidenced by the merlons and arrowslits): both areas include vaulted ceilings. Sometime during its period of use, the medieval architects constructed a wall that divided the two floors into two dependencies. In front of the tower, are remnants of smaller buildings, that correspond to the primitive stables and kitchen. Generally, the area within the walls are cramped and dominated by large stones of various dimensions. A primitive irregular cistern is also situated within the walls of the fortification; and high, the vaulted cistern has a capacity to store of water.

Biography  Sunderasan was born on 1 July 1975 in a lower middle class household. His basic education was in engineering and he graduated in 1996. He then pursued a profession in software services and worked for six years and then resigned to take up career as a writer. He had a brief stint as a freelance journalist in Mangalore for which he was never paid. His life's experiences covering Mumbai, Mangalore and Milwaukee influence his writings as the subjects covered relate to the corporate world and \\"modern Newsspeak, India Apathetic, World Apathetic and the big why of Existence\\". He has also trained as a counselor with obtaining a Diploma in Counselling Skills in 2013 from the Banjara Academy. He is married and has a daughter, Risha. Sunderasan showed interest in writing from a young age of 8 when he wrote a short story based on the marriage alliance event of his unmarried aunt but she tore it and threw it in the dustbin. However, he became a full-time writer with his debut novel Behind the Silicon Mask. It was a crime thriller written in the background of Milwaukee, USA which revolved around a serial killer who was targeting immigrants but whose identity could not be established. He started writing this book in 2003, completed in 2009 and but could find a publisher to publish it only in 2013. Writing about this book Sundaresan observes: \\"My focus has always been to write engaging stories that the reader would like to read. Be it thriller or any other genre, I try to make the books a page turner\\". His second book Bangalored: the Expat Story was published in 2006. In this book he portrayed the Bangalore city from the perspective of the expatriates living in the city, unlike the earlier definition of \\"Bangalored\\", which was coined as a term of disparagement during the American presidential election in 2004, when it was meant as losing one’s job in the US due to outsourcing to Bangalore. The story is presented mostly reflecting the life styles and experiences of the 12,000 and odd foreigners making a living in the metropolitan city which has the ambiance of a small town. He has presented the story mostly be way of interviews with some of the foreigners of different continents. His book Red Curry, is a leftist oriented story related to the Naxalite movement in the country. Reviews On his first fiction novel Behind the Silicon Mask, Puneetinder Kaur Sidhu writing for the Tribune India observes: \\"Eshwar’s conversational style of writing in his first book, coupled with humorous insight about the people he encountered on the job, results in a light-hearted piece of work, worthy of a lazy weekend.\\" Vasant Gokarn writing a review Bangalored: the Expat Story for the Business Standard has observed: \\"There is a capsule of Bangalore's history at the end of the book, which would be of heightened interest to readers who are not familiar with the city. Bangalore has a history of great planners and administrators with vision, like Sir Mark Cubbon in the late 19th century, and Sir Mirza Ismail and Sir Mokshagundam Visweswariah in the first half of the 20th century.\\" Kala Krishnan Ramesh in his review Bangalored: the Expat Storyfor The Hindu says: \\"Pleasant reading, varied voices, varied stories, good humour, and many things that we may not have known about Bangalore.

Template estimation in computational anatomy from populations of observations is a fundamental operation ubiquitous to the discipline. Several methods for template estimation based on Bayesian probability and statistics in the random orbit model of CA have emerged for submanifolds and dense image volumes.  The deformable template model of shapes and forms via diffeomorphic group actions  Linear algebra is one of the central tools to modern engineering. Central to linear algebra is the notion of an orbit of vectors, with the matrices forming groups (matrices with inverses and identity) which act on the vectors. In linear algebra the equations describing the orbit elements the vectors are linear in the vectors being acted upon by the matrices. In computational anatomy the space of all shapes and forms is modeled as an orbit similar to the vectors in linear- algebra, however the groups do not act linear as the matrices do, and the shapes and forms are not additive. In computational anatomy addition is essentially replaced by the law of composition. The central group acting CA defined on volumes in {\\\\mathbb R}^3 are the diffeomorphisms \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\doteq Diff which are mappings with 3-components \\\\phi(\\\\cdot) = (\\\\phi_1(\\\\cdot),\\\\phi_2 (\\\\cdot),\\\\phi_3 (\\\\cdot)), law of composition of functions \\\\phi \\\\circ \\\\phi^\\\\prime (\\\\cdot)\\\\doteq \\\\phi (\\\\phi^\\\\prime(\\\\cdot)) , with inverse \\\\phi \\\\circ \\\\phi^{-1}(\\\\cdot) =\\\\phi ( \\\\phi^{-1}(\\\\cdot))= id.

Several group actions in computational anatomy have been defined.  Geodesic positioning via the Riemannian exponential  For the study of deformable shape in CA, a more general diffeomorphism group has been the group of choice, which is the infinite dimensional analogue.

The modelling approach used in CA enforces a continuous differentiability condition on the vector fields by modelling the space of vector fields (V, \\\\ \\\\cdot \\\\_V ) as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), with the norm defined by a 1-1, differential operator A: V \\\\rightarrow V^* , Green's inverse K = A^{-1}.

Thus (V, \\\\ \\\\cdot \\\\_V ) embed smoothly in 1-time continuously differentiable functions. The diffeomorphism group are flows with vector fields absolutely integrable in Sobolev norm:  The Bayes model of computational anatomy  The central statistical model of computational anatomy in the context of medical imaging is the source-channel model of Shannon theory; the source is the deformable template of images I \\\\in \\\\mathcal {I} , the channel outputs are the imaging sensors with observables I^D \\\\in {\\\\mathcal I}^{\\\\mathcal D} . The variation in the anatomical configurations are modelled separately from the Medical imaging modalities Computed Axial Tomography machine, MRI machine, PET machine, and others. The Bayes theory models the prior on the source of images \\\\pi_{\\\\mathcal{I}} (\\\\cdot) on I \\\\in \\\\mathcal{I} , and the conditional density on the observable imagery p(\\\\cdot I) \\\\ \\\\text{on} \\\\ I^D \\\\in {\\\\mathcal I}^{\\\\mathcal D} , conditioned on I \\\\in \\\\mathcal{I} . For images with diffeomorphism group action I \\\\doteq \\\\phi \\\\cdot I_\\\\mathrm{temp}, \\\\phi \\\\in Diff_V, then the prior on the group \\\\pi_{Diff_V} (\\\\cdot) induces the prior on images \\\\pi_{\\\\mathcal{I}} (\\\\cdot), written as densities the log-posterior takes the form : \\\\log p(\\\\phi \\\\cdot I\\\\mid I^D) \\\\simeq \\\\log p(I^D \\\\mid \\\\phi \\\\cdot I)+ \\\\log \\\\pi_{\\\\operatorname{Diff}_V}(\\\\phi) \\\\ . Maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) estimation is central to modern statistical theory. Parameters of interest \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta take many forms including (i) disease type such as neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental diseases, (ii) structure type such as cortical or subcortical structures in problems associated to segmentation of images, and (iii) template reconstruction from populations. Given the observed image I^D , MAP estimation maximizes the posterior: : \\\\hat \\\\theta \\\\doteq \\\\arg \\\\max_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\log p(\\\\theta \\\\mid I^D). thumbShown are shape templates of amygdala, hippocampus, and ventricle generated from 754 ADNI samples\` Top panel denotes the localized surface area group differences between normal aging and Alzheimer disease (positive represents atrophy in Alzheimer whereas negative suggests expansion).

Surface templates for computational neuroanatomy and subcortical structures  The study of sub-cortical neuroanatomy has been the focus of many studies. Since the original publications by Csernansky and colleagues of hippocampal change in Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and Depression, many neuroanatomical shape statistical studies have now been completed using templates built from all of the subcortical structures for depression, Alzheimer's, Bipolar disorder, ADHD, autism, and Huntington's Disease. Templates were generated using Bayesian template estimation data back to Ma, Younes and Miller. Shown in the accompanying Figure is an example of subcortical structure templates generated from T1-weighted magnetic resonance imagery by Tang et al. for the study of Alzheimer's disease in the ADNI population of subjects.  Surface estimation in cardiac computational anatomy  Showing population atlases identifying regional differences in radial thickness at end-systolic cardiac phase between patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (left) and hypertensive heart disease (right). Gray mesh shows the common surface template to the population, with the color map representing basilar septal and anterior epicardial wall with larger radial thickness in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy vs. hypertensive heart disease. Numerous studies have now been done on cardiac hypertrophy and the role of the structural integraties in the functional mechanics of the heart. Siamak Ardekani has been working on populations of Cardiac anatomies reconstructing atlas coordinate systems from populations. The figure on the right shows the computational cardiac anatomy method being used to identify regional differences in radial thickness at end-systolic cardiac phase between patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (left) and hypertensive heart disease (right). Color map that is placed on a common surface template (gray mesh) represents region ( basilar septal and the anterior epicardial wall) that has on average significantly larger radial thickness in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy vs. hypertensive heart disease (reference below).  MAP Estimation of volume templates from populations and the EM algorithm  Generating templates empirically from populations is a fundamental operation ubiquitous to the discipline. Several methods based on Bayesian statistics have emerged for submanifolds and dense image volumes. For the dense image volume case, given the observable I^{D_1}, I^{D_2}, \\\\dots the problem is to estimate the template in the orbit of dense images I \\\\in \\\\mathcal{I} . Ma's procedure takes an initial hypertemplate I_0 \\\\in \\\\mathcal{I} as the starting point, and models the template in the orbit under the unknown to be estimated diffeomorphism I \\\\doteq \\\\phi_0 \\\\cdot I_0 , with the parameters to be estimated the log-coordinates \\\\theta \\\\doteq v_0 determining the geodesic mapping of the hyper-template \\\\mathrm{Exp}_\\\\mathrm{id}(v_0) \\\\cdot I_0 = I \\\\in \\\\mathcal{I}. In the Bayesian random orbit model of computational anatomy the observed MRI images I^{D_i} are modelled as a conditionally Gaussian random field with mean field \\\\phi_i \\\\cdot I, with \\\\phi_i a random unknown transformation of the template. The MAP estimation problem is to estimate the unknown template I \\\\in \\\\mathcal{I} given the observed MRI images. Ma's procedure for dense imagery takes an initial hypertemplate I_0 \\\\in \\\\mathcal{I} as the starting point, and models the template in the orbit under the unknown to be estimated diffeomorphism I \\\\doteq \\\\phi_0 \\\\cdot I_0 . The observables are modelled as conditional random fields, I^{D_i} a random field with mean field \\\\phi_i \\\\cdot I \\\\doteq \\\\phi_i \\\\cdot \\\\phi_0 \\\\cdot I_0 . The unknown variable to be estimated explicitly by MAP is the mapping of the hyper-template \\\\phi_0, with the other mappings considered as nuisance or hidden variables which are integrated out via the Bayes procedure. This is accomplished using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The orbit- model is exploited by associating the unknown to be estimated flows to their log-coordinates v_i,i=1,\\\\dots via the Riemannian geodesic log and exponential for computational anatomy the initial vector field in the tangent space at the identity so that \\\\mathrm{Exp}_\\\\mathrm{id}(v_{i}) \\\\doteq \\\\phi_i , with \\\\mathrm{Exp}_\\\\mathrm{id}(v_{0}) the mapping of the hyper-template. The MAP estimation problem becomes : \\\\max_{v_0} p(I^D, \\\\theta = v_0) = \\\\int p(I^D, \\\\theta= v_0\\\\mid v_1,v_2, \\\\dots ) \\\\pi(v_1,v_2, \\\\dots ) \\\\, dv The EM algorithm takes as complete data the vector-field coordinates parameterizing the mapping, v_i,i=1,\\\\dots and compute iteratively the conditional-expectation : \\\\begin{matrix} Q(\\\\theta=v_0; \\\\theta^\\\\text{old}=v_0^\\\\text{old}) & = - E ( \\\\log p(I^D, \\\\theta=v_0 \\\\mid v_1,v_2,\\\\dots)I^D, \\\\theta^\\\\text{old}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = - \\\\ ( \\\\bar I^\\\\text{old} - I_0 \\\\circ \\\\mathrm{Exp}_\\\\mathrm{id}(v_0)^{-1} ) \\\\sqrt{\\\\beta^\\\\text{old}} \\\\^2 - \\\\v_0\\\\_V^2 \\\\end{matrix} * Compute new template maximizing Q-function, setting \\\\theta^\\\\text{new}\\\\doteq v_0^\\\\text{new} = \\\\arg \\\\max_{\\\\theta = v_0} Q(\\\\theta ; \\\\theta^\\\\text{old}=v_0^\\\\text{old}) = - \\\\ ( \\\\bar I^\\\\text{old} - I_0 \\\\circ \\\\mathrm{Exp}_\\\\mathrm{id}(v_0)^{-1} ) \\\\sqrt{\\\\beta^\\\\text{old}}\\\\^2  \\\\ v_0\\\\_V^2 * Compute the mode-approximation for the expectation updating the expected-values for the mode values: :: v_i^\\\\text{new} = \\\\arg \\\\max_{v: \\\\dot \\\\phi = v \\\\circ \\\\phi } - \\\\int_0^1 \\\\ v_t \\\\_V^2 \\\\, dt - \\\\ I^{D_i} - I_0 \\\\circ \\\\mathrm{Exp}_\\\\mathrm{id}(v_0^\\\\text{old})^{-1} \\\\circ \\\\mathrm{Exp}_\\\\mathrm{id}(v)^{-1} \\\\^2. i=1,2,\\\\dots :: \\\\beta^\\\\text{new} (x) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n  D \\\\mathrm{Exp}_\\\\mathrm{id}(v_i^\\\\text{new})(x) , \\\\text{ with } \\\\bar I^\\\\text{new} (x) = \\\\frac{ \\\\sum_{i=1}^n I^{D_i} \\\\circ \\\\mathrm{Exp}_\\\\mathrm{id}(v_i^\\\\text{new})  D \\\\mathrm{Exp}_\\\\mathrm{id}(v_i^\\\\text{new})(x)  }{ \\\\beta^\\\\text{old}(x)}  References  Category:Bayesian estimation Category:Philosophy of science ","title":"Bayesian estimation of templates in computational anatomy"},{"id":"49345005","text":"Knud Langeland (October 27, 1813 - February 8, 1886) was an American editor, farmer, and politician.

Born in Drenica, Prekaz (back then Ottoman Empire) his father, Deli Prekazi, was one of the founders of the League. Ahmet Delia became active early during the Albanian war of resistance against the invading Serb army in 1912. Ahmet Delia became one of the most important figures of the Albanian struggle for freedom when he defended a house in Prekaz that was being attacked by Serb forces in 1912. A group of 13 Serb soldiers had entered the village and begun looting, burning and killing Albanian civilians. Ahmet Delia, aged 63 at the time, spotted the soldiers as they forced the neighbor Halil and his family on the yard.The life of Ahmet Delia When Delia heard the women and children crying he decided to take action and approached the house. He called on his son Mursel and the village chieftain, Rame Islami, and together they approached the soldiers. Delia lacked proper weapons and armed himself with an axe whilst the other two took up spades. When Delia entered the yard the other two blocked the door, cutting off the Serb soldiers and allowing Delia to fatally wound the vanguard. The Serb soldiers, alarmed by the sudden ambush, decided to try and surround Delia only to be ambushed by Mursel in turn, killing them and arming himself with their rifles which he then turned on the rest of the unit. Delia continued to swing his axe against the Serb soldiers whilst Mursel and Rame overran those that converged on Delia. One soldier managed to shoot Delia, injuring him, but was almost immediately overpowered by Mursel who choked the soldier to death. The fight ended with 12 dead Serbian soldiers leaving only Jovan Radosavljevic as the sole survivor of the unit, who attempted to flee but was captured by Rame shortly afterwards. Delia spared Jovan's life and ordered the release of the soldier to deliver a message to then king of Serbia, Petar Karađorđević, of the fate that awaited anyone attempting to occupy Albanian lands. Delia succumbed to his injuries hours later and the village was repeatedly attacked later that year. During the Kosovo war of 1998, Serbian forces burned down the majority of the village.

It was released on May 12, 2015 through Thinksay Records. Duchovny's backing band on the record, Weather, consists of Berklee- trained musicians. The album was produced by Weather member Colin Lee. The album features a folk rock and alternative rock sound with elements from country music. Duchovny cited various rock and folk artists such as Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Wilco, R.E.M., and the Flaming Lips as influences on the record. Background David Duchovny began playing guitar only four years prior to the album. All of the songs were written in his apartment. He said that while most songwriters claim that lyrics are the hardest part of songwriting, coming up with the music was harder for him. Although the songs are not confessional or about anyone specific, Duchovny said that they are his life experiences and cited a Neil Simon quote; \\"Everything's autobiographical, even the stuff you make up.\\" The song \\"Positively Madison Avenue\\" was inspired by a Super Bowl commercial featuring Bob Dylan and about the commercialism that his kids were being subjected to. Having no singing experience, Duchovny took singing lessons from vocal coach Don Lawrence. The album was recorded in a week and a half at Q Division Studios in Somerville, Massachusetts with Berklee-trained musicians. Critical reception Consequence of Sound's Dan Caffrey wrote: \\"You have to emulate before you can innovate, and as Duchovny continues to hone his musical chops, perhaps he'll transform the sounds of his heroes into something that’s distinctly his own.\\" Jim Farber of New York Daily News described the record as \\"credible rock album\\" and noted that Duchovny's singing style was \\"sullen, inward, and broken, with a character redeemed by a dark charm.\\" Farber also concluded: \\"In besting the grand majority of other actor/singers, he has done himself proud.\\" Nevertheless, The Washington Times critic Eric Althoff criticized Duchovny's vocals, writing: \\"Overall, the disc is uneven; when it’s good, it achieves well, but Mr. Duchovny’s vocals prove to be his own worst liability.\\" Track listing All songs written by David Duchovny. # \\"Let It Rain\\" – 4:35 # \\"3000\\" – 3:40 # \\"Stars\\" – 2:58 # \\"Hell or Highwater\\" – 5:46 # \\"The Things\\" – 3:57 # \\"The Rain Song\\" – 4:07 # \\"Unsaid Undone\\" – 4:16 # \\"Lately It's Always December\\" – 4:50 # \\"Another Year\\" – 4:56 # \\"Passenger\\" – 4:38 # \\"When the Time Comes\\" – 3:39 # \\"Positively Madison Avenue\\" – 6:57 Personnel * David Duchovny – vocals, guitar * Colin Lee – performance, production * Weather – performance References External links * Category:2015 debut albums Category:David Duchovny albums ","title":"Hell or Highwater (album)"},{"id":"49345205","text":"Thomas W.

It was discovered by American astronomer Timothy Spahr at the U.S. Catalina Station, Arizona, on 5 August 1994. The asteroid was named after cartoonist Bill Watterson.  Orbit and classification  The S-type asteroid is a member of the Phocaea family (), a group of asteroids with similar orbital characteristics. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.7–2.8 AU once every 3 years and 5 months (1,248 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 23° with respect to the ecliptic.  Physical characteristics  In 2011, a photometric lightcurve analysis by astronomer Brian Skiff gave a rotation period of hours with a relatively low brightness amplitude of 0.10 magnitude, indicative of a nearly spheroidal shape (). According to the surveys carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Watterson has an albedo of 0.19 and a diameter of 5.6 kilometers. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link agrees with WISE's observations and assumes a slightly higher albedo of 0.23 and calculates a diameter of 5.5 kilometers.  Naming  This minor planet is named after Bill Watterson (born 1958), cartoonist of the daily comic strip Calvin and Hobbes. Syndicated from 1985 to 1995, this strip is fondly remembered and treasured by the discoverer, and helped him stay awake and sane on long observing nights and during the trials and tribulations of graduate school.

Savoy worked for 21 secretaries of the state through 14 presidencies from President Ulysses S. Grant to Franklin D. Roosevelt. When he retired in 1933 at the age of 77, he had just concluded his service as Chief Messenger to Secretary of State, Henry L. Stimson. Early life and parents \\"Eddie\\" Augustine Savoy in 1931 Edward Augustine Savoy was born a free man in Washington, DC to Edward Louis Savoy and Elizabeth E. Van Rhoda Butler Savoy in 1855. His father, Edward Louis Savoy born enslaved, held many trades and was a caterer in Washington, catering events at the White House and at the opening reception of the Corcoran Art Gallery. Edward Louis Savoy served as a committee member of the First District Colored Regiment returning from the Civil War, and also served as a delegate who petitioned the United States Congress for the right to suffrage. His mother, Elizabeth E. Van Rhoda Butler Savoy, was a maid and later became a school teacher in the District of Columbia's segregated school system. She was active in the antislavery movement and aided the Underground Railroad by helping escaped slaves make their way to Canada and freedom. His parents worked as maid and butler for Secretary of State, Hamilton Fish, who later hired Edward Augustine at the age of 14. Edward Augustine Savoy was educated in the District of Columbia Public School System.  Career  \\"Eddie\\", as he was familiarly known by leading diplomats and top-ranking officials of the Federal Government, began his career in public service in 1869, classified first as a page, and later as a messenger to Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, eventually serving under twenty-two secretaries. In 1901, from Secretary John Hay onward, Savoy was assigned to staff the diplomatic anterooms of the Secretaries of State where it was his challenge to delicately usher diplomats in and out of the office, often avoiding conflicts between ambassadors at odds with each other, and on occasion to serve passports to departing diplomats. Eddie handed passports to: Luis Polo y Barnabé, the Spanish ambassador, forcing his departure from the United States when war was declared on Spain in 1898; Lord Sackville-West, the British envoy sent home by President Cleveland; and to the Austrian Charge d' Affaire when the United States entered the First World War. Savoy was attendant to, and courier for many important international treaties, frequently the presenter of ceremonial pens, and seals for the proceedings. He and fellow messenger William Gwin were present for the signing of the Hay- Pauncefote Treaty on Nov. 18, 1901, opening way for the construction of the Panama Canal. On Nov. 25, 1905, Savoy was one of few witnesses to the final steps of the exchange of ratifications of the Treaty of Portsmouth of September earlier that fall, to end the war between Russia and Japan. In 1931, after 59 years of service, and even though Savoy was past retirement age, Congressman (NY) Hamilton Fish II introduced a bill to extend his term of service, and by special arrangements made by Secretary Stimson, he remained at his post another two years. After 64 years of service, on March 12, 1933, President Roosevelt personally sent a car around to bring Edward A. Savoy to the White House to bestow formal congratulations upon him at his retirement. Memorials Edward \\"Eddie\\" Augustine Savoy died at the age of 88, on August 24, 1943. Many national papers carried the news. Savoy is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, Benning Ridge neighborhood of Washington DC.

He is the Poitras Professor of Neuroscience at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT and member of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at Broad Institute. He is most notable for studying the synaptic mechanisms underlying psychiatric disease. In addition to developing many genetic-based imaging tools for the study of molecular mechanisms in the brain, he has generated and characterized rodent models of obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia. Feng has also shown that some autism-like behaviors can be corrected in adult mice by manipulating the expression of the SHANK3 gene.  Education  Feng received his PhD from SUNY Buffalo. He conducted his postdoctoral work at Washington University School of Medicine. Prior to joining the McGovern Institute in 2010, Feng was a faculty member at Duke University. He is currently the Poitras Professor of Neuroscience and the Director of Model Systems and Neurobiology in the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at Broad Institute.  Research  Feng studies mutations of the postsynaptic density (PSD), the protein scaffold which stabilizes neurotransmitter receptors, permits normal function of the synapse, and participates in synaptic plasticity. He has demonstrated that mutations in SAPAP3, a gene primarily expressed in the striatum, are associated with repetitive grooming behaviors in mice, resembling repetitive behaviors observed in obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) and autism. SAPAP3's role in the Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. He has also shown that mutations in SHANK3, associated with Phelan McDermid syndrome (PMS), lead to autism-like symptoms such as repetitive behaviors, sensory hyper-sensitivity, and social deficits in mice. In 2016, Feng showed that gene therapy to restore normal SHANK3 function in adult mice could reverse some behavioral symptoms. Feng also studies rare neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett syndrome and Williams syndrome. In 2018, Feng and colleague Robert Desimone received a grant of over $2.3 million USD to correct MECP2 mutations, which are the cause of Rett syndrome. In 2019, Feng and Zhigang He demonstrated that increasing myelination with the drug clemastine fumarate could reverse myelin deficits and hypersociability symptoms in mice lacking GTF2I, which may be translatable to human patients.

On the day of her execution, 4 May 1763, in what The Newgate Calendar described as an \\"extraordinary and unprecedented scene\\" she struggled violently with the executioner, and with the noose about her neck, flung herself from the cart before the signal was given, dying instantly. Life and death Hannah Dagoe was born in Ireland, and was of that numerous class of women who plied at Covent Garden Market as \\"basket-women\\", or porters. Dagoe had previously been incarcerated for debt in Whitechapel Jail, where she married a fellow prisoner, a Spanish seaman, \\"Diego\\" or \\"Dago\\", from whom she took her surname. After he either left the country or died, she took up with the keeper of the prisoner, one William Connor. She was a strong, masculine woman and the terror of her fellow- prisoners, one of whom she stabbed in a quarrel. For this she was sent to Newgate prison for six months, where she stabbed another man, for no personal provocation, but because he had turned evidence against his accomplices. She was also imprisoned at the Poultry Compter several times. She became acquainted with a poor and industrious woman of the name of Eleanor Hussey, who lived by herself in a small apartment, in which was some creditable household furniture, the remains of the worldly goods of her deceased husband. Seizing an opportunity, when the owner was from home, this daring woman broke into Hussey's room and stripped it of every article which it contained. For this burglary and robbery she was brought to trial at the Old Bailey, found guilty, and sentenced to death. The day before she was due to die, James Boswell saw Dagoe in the courtyard of Newgate prison, remarking in his diary that she was a \\"big unconcerned thing\\". Although present at the execution, Boswell curiously did not record the unusual manner of her death. On the road to Tyburn she showed little concern at her miserable state, and paid no attention to the exhortations of the Romish priest who attended her. When the cart, in which she was bound, was drawn under the gallows, she got her hands and arms loose, seized the executioner, struggled with him, and gave him so violent a blow on the breast that she nearly knocked him down. She dared him to hang her; and in order to revenge herself upon him, and cheat him of his dues, she took off her hat, cloak and other parts of her dress, and disposed of them among the crowd. After much resistance he got the rope about her neck, which she had no sooner found accomplished than, pulling out a hand kerchief, she bound it round her head and over her face, and threw herself out of the cart, before the signal was given, with such violence that she broke her neck and died instantly.

Career From Bethnal Green in London, Pattenden made his professional debut in July 1926 with a win over Billy Clark. He won his first 14 fights, including victories over Frankie Ash, Nel Tarleton, George \\"Kid\\" Nicholson, and Harry Stein. His first defeat came in April 1927 against the American Milton Cohen, starting a run of five fights without a win, including a draw and a loss to Archie Bell. He returned to winning ways in August against Len Fowler, and recorded wins against Young Jackie Brown, Kid Socks, European champion Johnny Brown, Young Stanley, Jean Julien, and Young Johnny Brown, setting up a shot at the British title. In June 1928 he faced Nicholson at the National Sporting Club for the British bantamweight title that had been taken from Johnny Brown due to his failure to defend it for almost three years. Pattenden knocked Nicholson out in the twelfth round to become the new British champion.Golesworthy, Maurice (1988) Encyclopaedia of Boxing, Robert Hale, , p. 193 He made the first defence of his title in November 1928, stopping Young Johnny Brown in the twelfth round. In February 1929 he lost on points to Tarleton, and a month later fought Henri Poutrain with the same result. He won his next two fights before making a second defence of the British title in May 1929 against his East London rival Teddy Baldock, with the British Empire title also at stake. the Fight went the full 15 rounds, with Baldock getting the decision. Pattenden suffered further defeats at the hands of Nipper Pat Daly and Len \\"Tiger\\" Smith in his next two fights. He put together some better results, despite being out for several months due to burns to his hands sustained in September 1929, and in March 1930 faced Dick Corbett in what was effectively a British title eliminator at the Royal Albert Hall. Corbett took the points decision. Pattenden beat Jimmy Rowbotham in his next fight, but was never again in contention for a title, losing 16 of his last 21 fights, including a second defeat to Baldock, before retiring in 1931 due to eye problems.

She argued that a wife is a 50-50 partner in a marriage, and therefore worth half of the assets. She was eventually awarded about one-fifth of the estimated worth of the estate. Early life and marriage Jorgenson Wendt was born on June 14, 1943, in Minot, North Dakota. Her father was a Lutheran minister, her mother a homemaker. The couple met in high school; both graduated from the University of Wisconsin, after which they married in 1965. Jorgenson Wendt worked as a music teacher until the birth of their first child in 1968. Divorce In 1996, Gary C. Wendt, then CEO of the GE Capital Corporation, began divorce proceedings against his wife. Although Connecticut's divorce law allowed for equitable distribution, not community property as in some states, Jorgenson Wendt filed for half of her husband's $100 million wealth. Rather than the offered $8 million from her ex-husband, the court awarded Jorgenson Wendt $20 million. The ruling extended to 420 pages. Jorgenson Wendt appealed that ruling, wanting one half of the estate, but the original decision was upheld in 2000. Jorgenson Wendt formed the Institute for Marriage Equality in 1998, which she ran until it closed in 2006. She lectured throughout the country on issue of the value of a wife's contribution to a marriage. Impact of the case Jorgenson Wendt was on the cover of Forbes magazine with the headline \\"What's a Corporate Wife Worth?\\" She went on to become an advocate for prenuptual agreements.

However, wreckage from the cruiser started to wash up on the beaches of Tarifa and Algeciras. The cruiser had disappeared and had probably sunk somewhere in the Gulf of Cádiz with the loss of her entire crew. The current location of the ship is still unknown. This incident remains one of the deadliest shipwrecks of the Spanish Navy.

He made his debut for his country in June 2005, coming on as a substitute for Ruud van Nistelrooy in a 2–0 victory over Romania. His first international goal came on his next appearance for the Netherlands, scoring the final goal in a 4-0 defeat of Finland in Helsinki during the qualification campaign for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. , van Persie is his country's top scorer with 50 goals in 102 appearances, ahead of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar (42 in 76) and former all-time top scorer Patrick Kluivert (40 in 79). Van Persie made his last appearance for the Netherlands in August 2017 in a 4-0 World Cup qualifier defeat to France. Van Persie has scored two hat-tricks during his international career. In September 2011, he scored four goals in an 11–0 victory against San Marino in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying match.

Karma joined OpTic replacing outgoing captain Matt \\"Nadeshot\\" Haag on the team. He is a naturalized American citizen.\\"Enable on loan to OpTic, subbing for Karma at ESWC\\" . 15 April 2015. As of May 2020, Karma has won $807,847.25 from tournament winnings, making him the player to have earned to second most total prize money playing professional Call of Duty, and making him the player to have earned the second most total prize money playing any professional console game. He also runs an active YouTube channel. Beginnings Damon \\"Karma\\" Barlow first started playing Call of Duty during Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. He started showcasing what he was truly capable of with the release of Call of Duty: World at War, however, his skill went largely unnoticed due to the lack of support in the community of the game. His first real chance to shine came with the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops. His first major event was MLG Columbus where he placed a decent 10th with his team yunGunZ. Going into the next event the team showed signs of improvement finishing 6th at MLG Anaheim. However, looking for more than just an average showing, he joined forces with the legendary Rambo under the Xtravagant name. Expecting to replicate the success the IXI name saw in the past, Karma and his teammates went into the rest of the season confident. However, it turned out to be much of the same with another 6th-place finish at MLG Orlando and a 5th-place finish at the season end MLG National Championship 2011. Breakthrough Like many players, due to the lack of support he chose to not compete during Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. With the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops II, he joined the newly formed team Fariko Impact coming in with great expectations. Following solid performances at the first two events, but not what the team was expecting, the roster got reshuffled. Going into the MLG Winter Championship in Dallas, Impact's roster consisted of Karma, Parasite, Killa, and Mirx. This is where both the team and Karma himself started reaching new levels. They ran through the competition and took the tournament win. This success continued into the next 3 events with the highlight being the Call of Duty Championship where Impact won the grand prize of $400,000. During this streak of wins, Karma became known as the best player in the game. However, like all good things, the success came to a stop at the MLG Spring Championship where Impact finished 2nd. Hoping they could bring back the success they had previously seen, the team stuck together for another go during Gfinity 1. Unfortunately, it got worse, as the team finished a disappointing 4th. Before the team arrived back in the states, Karma left Impact and joined EnVyUs. Expectations skyrocketed immediately for the team with people expecting them to be capable of knocking compLexity off of their historic run. Unfortunately, this never happened as EnVyUs never achieved even a top 3 finish the Black Ops 2 season. Evil Geniuses Going into the release of Call of Duty: Ghosts, EnVyUs still had high expectations of winning championships. At the first event of the season at MLG Fall Championship, the team once again came up well short of what was expected, finishing 6th. This was the last straw for Karma as he decided to make another team change. He left Envy and joined compLexity. The roster change by compLexity following a tournament win at the MLG Fall Championship was met with much criticism, however Karma quickly proved why he is still considered one of the best in the game as the team won their first two events together at UMG Philadelphia and Call of Duty Championship 2014. Following the win at the biggest championship of the year, Karma along with the rest of the team cemented themselves as the clear favorites going into every event. At the next major LAN event at UGC Niagara, the team finally looked beatable falling to an amateur team, XGN, in the first round of the Championship Bracket. However, the Losers Bracket didn't scare them, as they went 21–2 in map count on Sunday to go all the way through the Losers bracket and win the tournament. Following the tournament, Karma and his teammates announced that they were joining Evil Geniuses. Following the switch over to Evil Geniuses, the team hoped to continue the same success. Unfortunately, they came up short at their very first event which was the MLG X Games Invitational. They took home a disappointing bronze medal. Despite the loss, the team was able to bounce back and win the International Playoff at the MLG Championship Anaheim losing only a combined 5 maps the entire event. Karma and the rest of the team hoped this would be a sign of more success for them. However, at Gfinity 3 the team lost to Team Kaliber in their group stage ensuring they can only have the second seed. They were placed in the Championship Bracket against FaZe who they would end up losing to, 3–0. The team had their worst placing to date finishing in the 5th-8th category. The next event was UMG Dallas but EG would not be attending due to Karma's wife giving birth and him wanting to stay at home with her. After Dallas, Karma announced that he was no longer happy with EG and would be leaving. After some speculation, it was announced that he was loaned to FaZe Clan for the remainder of the season but would remain on contract with Evil Geniuses. He later left Evil Geniuses after he complained on Twitter of being criticized for missing the Electronic Sports League Gamescom tournament for the birth of his daughter.\\"Evil Geniuses loses Karma over missing time due to birth of his child\\".

Biography  He was born in Madrid to the German/Spanish family Armbruster/Blecher. His father Eugen Armbruster was a successful industrialist in Spain (tubes, plastics, metals, energy, banks, forests) and his mother, Trude Armbruster (née Blecher) was a renowned violinist. At an early age, Ricardo Armbruster and his family discovered that schooling and academic life were not going to be his preferred way of advancing personally. He developed a wide interest in animals and nature in the 1950s, spending long periods at the family farm in Camorritos, Spain, and becoming a respected naturalist at a very early stage. Soon afterwards, at the age of 17, he decided to travel and learn. He spent some time at several academies and jobs in Switzerland, Germany and London, before returning to Madrid and, from there, to the American continent. First, he traveled around the United States and Mexico with his brother and friends, before accepting a job at a bookstore in Bogotá, Colombia. After feeling frustrated by the fact that the store sold books by length for decoration rather than for reading, he felt the call of the wild, embarked on a trip to the south and disappeared in the Amazon rainforest. Some time later Ricardo Armbruster reappeared in Tenerife, on the Canary Islands. He had made a living by hunting in the forest, making research films, helping national armies explore new territories and, in the end, smuggling coffee to pay for a ship fare back to Europe. Back in Spain, Ricardo Armbruster settled down, married Erika Born, another German/Spanish national, and had two children: Yaukuma (named after a Mehinaku Indian of the Xingú River Basin) and Thurit Armbruster. The couple moved to Valladolid, in the north of Spain, where Ricardo Armbruster became a successful entrepreneur but was mostly recognized for his activist ecologism and political positioning (against the Spanish State of caudillo Francisco Franco). Ricardo Armbruster was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the AEORMA ecologist group, a strictly forbidden activity under the Francoist State. He was also, with Julio Valdeón Baruque, José Luis Martín, José Luis Barrigón, Carlos Santamaría, Carlos Carrasco, Manuel Conde and others, the driving force behind the creation of the Instituto Regional Castellano-Leonés, an autonomy-enhancing entity that was subject to severe persecution by Franco's authorities. Erika and Ricardo Armbruster's home in the Castillian countryside (La Corala) soon became a preferred stop for zoologists and naturalists in the early 1970s, who brought over every kind of fauna to be treated and cured. This made the premises look more like a zoo than a private home. The property also became a hot spot for debates about democracy and ecology among Spanish intellectuals, artists and oligarchs who appreciated Armbruster's views on these subjects. A rebel Christian (he married under scrutiny and press coverage following the Catholic and Lutheran rituals at a time of National Catholicism in Spain), Ricardo Armbruster died on Easter Sunday in April 1976, at the age of 32, in Ribadesella, Asturias (Spain), while scuba diving in search of eels and other sea species in the cold waters of the Cantabrian Sea.

It provides a solution for a wide range of problems in the construction of large and complex applications. Most notably, one implementation of composition filters provides an abstraction layer for message-passing systems. Composition filters work by changing the behavior of an object through the manipulation of incoming and outgoing messages. This is done with the help of input and output filters which are controlled by conditions.  History and motivation  In concurrent and distributed computing, there are many problems such as scattering and tangling of code, which were difficult to handle using traditional object-oriented models. A need arose to develop a new software development model which addressed these concerns and this resulted in the formation of the Aspect-oriented software development paradigm. Several models in this paradigm were developed concurrently, and one of them is the Composition Filters Object Model. The pioneers of this model were Mehmet Aksit and various PhD students (Lodewijk Bergmans, Jan Bosch, Bedir Tekinerdogan) and many MSc. students from the TRESE Group at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. It was based on the Sina language which was developed by Mehmet Aksit in his PhD thesis. Many advancements have been made in the model since then.  Design  The design of the composition filters model is an extension of the design of the kernel object model. The design consists of two major parts – the kernel or the implementation part, and the outer layer or the interface part. The extensions are made in the interface part to produce the composition filters model from the traditional kernel object model. = Implementation part = The implementation part or the kernel consists of a single layer with three types of components: # Instance variables # Methods # Conditions It also consists of an encapsulation boundary which separates the implementation and the interface layers.  Instance variables  The Instance Variables are the only components of the kernel which are fully encapsulated. It is not possible to access these variables from outside the boundary. In this model, the Instance Variables can be of any type. Primitive data types such as integers, characters and user-defined data types such as classes and enumerations are all considered to be Instance Variables.  Methods  The behavior of an object is implemented through its methods. The method consists of two parts – the method body and the method declaration. The actions that an object is expected to perform on being invoked is defined in the method body. The method declaration consists of the method name, the name and type of the parameters and the return type. Methods are not completely encapsulated in the kernel and can be used in the interface part. = Initial method = The initial method is a special method whose function is similar to that of the constructors in other object oriented models.  Conditions  A method which has a Boolean return type and an empty parameter list is called a condition. Conditions can be used to provide information about the current state of an object. Similar to methods, conditions too can be used in the interface part and most of the usage of the conditions is outside the implementation part. = Interface part = The interface part of the composition filters object model consists of two major components – the input and output filters. It also contains two supporting components – the internals and the externals. Moreover, the methods and conditions from the implementation part can also be accessed from the interface part.  Filters  The input and output filters are similar in design but vary in functionality. The input filters are tasked with dealing with the messages which are sent to the object, while output filters do so for messages being sent by the object. The main function of the filters is to manipulate the messages which arrive and pass them to the next layer. Filters are designed in layers, a message has to pass through one layer to reach the next. Each layer may consist of different filters. Each filter specifies a particular pattern. The pattern defines a syntax which an incoming or outgoing message must conform to. When a message arrives, two possibilities exist – the message is rejected by the filter or is manipulated by the filter. The way in which a message is rejected or manipulated depends upon the type of the filter. = Filter design = A filter is designed using a set of filter element. This set is ordered since each message is applied from left to right. This continues till a match occurs. Each filter element consists of three components – a condition, a matching part and a substitution part. Condition – The necessary state which the element has to be in to continue the evaluation of the message. Matching part – The part where the evaluated message is matched against a pattern. Substitution part – The part where the replacement values are specified for a message which has been matched earlier.  Internals  Internals are nested objects which reference to the input filters. They are completely encapsulated in the interface part. They are automatically created during the creation of an object.  Externals  Externals are nested objects which reference to the output filters. They are used to declare objects which lie outside the composition filters model but are still within its scope. An example of such objects are global variables.  SINA programming language  The SINA programming language is an object oriented programming language which was designed to implement the features of composition filters object model. Each SINA program is a collection of classes, each of which can be separated into the implementation and the interface. The first implementation of SINA was for the Smalltalk and ran only in that environment.  Applications  = Abstract communication types = An abstract communication type object abstracts communication and interactions among objects. The objectives of an ACT is to improve the reusability throughout the application, to hide the implementation details in separate modules and reducing the complexity of modeling layered communications architectures. Experts believe that conventional object-oriented models are too low-level because the semantics of communication between two objects cannot be easily extended to other objects. Therefore, there was a need for a high level language mechanism that can be used to model layered system architectures in which each system in a layer exchanges data with its adjacent layers. Mechanisms such as inheritance only provide abstraction at the object level, but fail in abstraction of communication among objects. Composition filters model were applied to abstract communications among objects. The object module is extended by introducing input and output filters which determine what needs to be done with received and sent messages. Notable ACT advantages include: * ACTs can be used for intercepting and manipulating messages both of which is achieved by input and output filters * ACTs reduce the complexity of programs by hiding the interaction code (communication details) in separate modules. Programmers can apply object oriented mechanisms to reuse these components.Mehmet Aksit, Ken Wakita, Jan Bosch, Lodewijk Bergmans and Akinori Yonezawa, \\"Abstracting Object Interactions Using Composition Filters\\", University of Twente, University of Tokyo and Tokyo Institute of Technology = Database integration model = Composition filters can be used to incorporate database features such as persistent dynamic data structures, data sharing, transactions, multiple views and associative access into an object-oriented language. The basic object-oriented mechanisms such as inheritance and delegation are also provided by composition filters. In the database integration model, database operations such as union, intersect, exclude, and select are developed using composition filters without disintegrating object oriented mechanisms such as data abstraction, encapsulation, message passing and inheritance.Mehmet Aksit, Lodewijk Bergmans and Sinan Vural, \\"An Object-Oriented Language-Database Integration Model: The Composition-Filters Approach\\", Computer Science Department, University of Twente = Other implementations = Many implementations of composition filters exist (including SmallTalk and Java implementations). The advantage of existing implementations is that there is no difference between the conceptual and implementation model, which makes it easier to understand the implementation of certain features. The drawback, however, is that these implementations are slow and have a lot of overhead. One implementation in Java, namely ComposeJ, addressed this problem by using a compile-time oriented source modification approach.Johannes Cornelis Wichman, \\"ComposeJ – The development of a preprocessor to facilitate Composition Filters in the Java Language\\", University of Twente  See also  * Aspect-oriented programming * Aspect-oriented software development * AspectJ  External links  * The Composition Filter Homepage * Composition Filters Implementation * http://trese.cs.utwente.nl/oldhtml/publications/papers/CF_superimposition_bergmans_aksit.pdf * Filters - History * SINA Programming Language * - Composition Filters in C++  References  Category:Software design patterns ","title":"Composition filters"},{"id":"49346143","text":"thumb Julia Sergeyevna Kutyukova (; born March 30, 1989 in Lipetsk) is Russian volleyball player.

The Coleman-Franklin-Cannon Mill still stands in Concord, North Carolina, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Born into slavery, Coleman learned shoemaking and barbering before he came of age as a freedman. He had a white attorney father who took an interest in him, and the ambitious Coleman made use of his contacts and became known as a highly successful entrepreneur in and around Concord, North Carolina. He developed a substantial general store and other retail outlets, bought land, and developed and rented residential real estate, owned farms in several areas, and had other businesses in addition to the mill. In 1900 Coleman was the wealthiest man of color in the state.  Early life  Coleman was born into slavery in 1849 in Cabarrus County. His mother, Roxanna Coleman, was of mixed race and held by planter Daniel Coleman, Sr. and his wife Mary (Mahan) Coleman; she took their surname. His white father was Rufus Clay Barringer (1821–1895), then a young, unmarried attorney whose family lived near the Colemans. Barringer became a politician, and later a Confederate general during the American Civil War. Warren and his older brother Thomas Clay, were both fathered by Barringer before the attorney married in 1854. Their mother had another illegitimate son, Joseph Smith, after breaking with Barringer. (Their father Barringer married three times - two wives died young - and had a total of three sons and a daughter from these marriages.) Coleman's mother married John F. Young, an enslaved skilled blacksmith who was held by another owner nearby. Generally the master of a slave husband would buy the wife so the family could be united on one plantation. But Daniel Coleman bought Young, who lived with his wife Roxanna and her children at his plantation. Warren Coleman is believed to have learned shoemaking and barbering skills while a youth on the Coleman plantation, both of which were considered good trades in those years. He later used these skills in his work for the Confederate Army as a boot and shoe maker. (White men who had mixed-race sons sometimes tried to prepare them through apprenticeships for such trades, by which they could support themselves as free men.)  Career  After the war, Warren Coleman was freed but bound in a two-year apprenticeship indenture to William M. Coleman until he came of age in 1867. (Coleman was a planter-lawyer in Cabarrus County, who later became the state attorney general, and he served as a patron of the younger man.) After that, Coleman moved to Alabama, seeking economic opportunities. He returned to Cabarrus County the next year, and established his first business; collecting rags, bones, and junk for resale and disposal. In 1873–1874, he went to Washington, DC, where he attended the Model School at Howard University] to learn more about business, a period of study supported by William Coleman. After his return to Concord, Coleman was likely aided by his father Barringer, who had a law practice in Concord and Charlotte until 1871, and likely also by William Coleman. For instance, the younger Coleman bought land from the Barringer family. Over the next 25 years, Warren Clay Coleman became one of the richest merchants of color in the state. His first land purchase was a 130-acre wooded farm in Cabarrus. His business ventures later expanded to include a mercantile store located on Main Street in Concord, the county seat. In 1875 he married Jane E. Jones. He also started a grocery store, specializing in teas, coffee, sugar, syrups, molasses, cakes, and candies. In 1879 Coleman combined his two stores, and his general store became one of the city's major shops. He built inexpensive worker housing for more than 100 rental houses in the African-American section of town over the following decades, and a residential rental company to manage them. They housed the numerous migrants to Concord from rural areas. Coleman's status as the son of Rufus Clay Barringer, who took an interest and advised the ambitious young man, and the relationships he established with other influential whites, are thought to have helped his making these initial investments. In the 1890s Coleman worked with black capitalists, African- American educator Booker T. Washington, and prominent white leaders, especially Washington Duke of Durham, North Carolina, to organize and build the nation's first African-American owned and operated textile factory. At the time, blacks were generally excluded as textile workers from white-owned mills, and Coleman and his partners wanted to create industrial opportunity for the black community. The company was incorporated in 1895/1896 and chartered by the state. At the height of its operations, the Coleman Manufacturing Company employed more than 300 African-American workers in a 96,000-square foot three-story brick building. It had assets worth $100,000. Because of an increase in cotton prices and other factors, the mill struggled financially and was closed after Coleman's death in 1904. It was sold to other parties. Although the mill passed out of black ownership after Coleman's death, its operation with black workers opened doors for others. Superior Court Judge Clarence Horton of Cabarrus County has noted that when a hosiery factory opened in 1913, it employed black seamstresses and other workers, unlike many white-owned mills in the South. In 1900 Coleman was the richest person of color in the county and state. Historian Norman J. McCullough Sr., who is working on a biography of the businessman, contends he was the richest African American in the country, noting that other black men became millionaires after 1900. Coleman owned property along Concord's Depot Street (now Cabarrus Avenue) and on Lincoln and Spring streets. He established a church called Price Temple so that people working for him could have a church close by. He also donated money to other black churches: Rock Hill and Zion Hill AME Zion churches in Concord. To encourage education among African Americans, Coleman subsidized tuition for students at Howard University, Livingstone College, and Shaw University, all historically black colleges. He also helped support the African-American orphanage in Oxford, North Carolina. Legacy Today the mill is owned by Bill Bryant, who ran a large printing operation here for a time. He leases much of the mill to smaller businesses: several specialty auto body and auto parts shops, a pool company, and a distillery for \\"moonshine\\". *In 2001, the section of Highway 601 South near the mill was named \\"Warren C. Coleman Boulevard\\" in his honor. *In 2015 the Coleman-Franklin-Cannon Mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. *In 2018 Price Memorial AME Zion Church held its first annual W.C.

His most important influences, however, came from Jan Feliks Piwarski, a landscape painter who was one of the first in Poland to promote the concept of painting en plein aire. He joined a group led by January Suchodolski that travelled on painting and drawing excursions throughout the country. In 1853, he received a scholarship and went to Saint Petersburg to enroll at the Imperial Academy of Arts, where he studied with the battle painter, Bogdan Willewalde. He graduated in 1856 and, the following year, went to Paris to study in the studios of Horace Vernet. After a year there, he travelled in Italy, then returned to Warsaw and remained there the rest of his life. He is primarily known for his landscapes and battle scenes. One of the most notable is a large canvas depicting King John II Casimir Vasa at the Battle of Berestechko, done together with Juliusz Kossak. Horses are a prominent feature in most of his works. From 1868 to 1890, he was a regular contributor to the magazine Tygodnik Ilustrowany. He died in 1900 and was buried at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw.

He preferred abstract form in public sculpture within architectural contexts and took part in several symposia on sculpture in Europe, the US, Israel, and Japan. Biography Yasuo Mizui entered into Kobe University in 1944. During World War II, he worked as technician at a company and learned casting. After his graduation in 1947, he entered Tokyo University of the Arts and majored in Sculpture. He was taught by Kazuo Kikuchi and Hirakushi Denchū. The reason of shifting his interest from mechanical engineering to sculpture was because he hoped of possibility of power of art, which has no frontier nor war and he chose \\"Art casting – Casting daibutsu\\" as his thesis. After graduation from Tokyo University of the Arts in 1953, he obtained a scholarship from French government to study further at École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts de Paris from 1953 to 1958, where he learned monumental art and sculpture from Alfred Janniot and Marcel Gimond. He apprenticed Apel·les Fenosa from 1954 to 1958 while studying at the university. While visiting the atelier, Fenosa assigned Mizui to create one piece of work made by clay every day upon his arrival. After several months, Mizui felt despair from his own creativity. However, he managed to create one at the last minute. This experience helped his subsequent career to attend the International Sculpture Symposium and to create large monumental works under the French program 1% for art. =Works for Olympic games in Japan and France= He has created walls of sculptures Les murs des fossils (Walls of fossils) for Tokyo Olympic games in Tokyo, Japan in 1964 and Microcosme et macrocosme for Winter Olympic Games in Grenoble, France. right Les murs des fossils (Walls of Fossils) (granite / 2mx 93x 0.3 / 1964 / Yoyogi National Gymnasium) Yoyogi National Gymnasium is arena for athletic games, located in Yoyogi Park, Tokyo, designed by Kenzo Tange and it was built between 1961 and 1964. Mizui received a request from Tange in February 1964 and created the wall of art with ten other assistants in Kitagi island for three months, then, delivered it to Tokyo in August for completion. Foreign media introduced its works in September. The length of the large abstract wall of reliefs is 93 m in total. They consist of 408 pieces of 1 m 82 cm x 60 cm x 30 cm Mikage stone and the total weight is 160 tons. These Mikage stones come from Kitagi Island, also known as \\"Stone Island\\", in Okayama, Japan. His concept Walls of Fossiles expresses 10 landscapes in his deep involvement with experience of life and nature-like memory as fossils; Travel – Flame – Weight – Perfume – Obsession – Water – Wisdom – Sound – Time – Light. As always, he carved all works by hand using chisels and large and small hammer. \\"Macrocosm and microcosm\\" (stone / 13 m x 81 x 0.4 / Olympic Village Grenoble). Two walls of 40 m – the \\"macrocosm and microcosm\\" – are expressed as the maximum and the minimum of the world. \\"The Maximum\\" symbolizes the great life of nature as Sun, Forest, Mountain, Sea, and River beyond the individual matter and \\"the Minimum\\" symbolizes the inner conflict of human beings. They express the world of nature and human beings. マルローTadao Takemoto, who translated the book \\"Anti-retrospective\\" (Shincho Sha, Japan, 1977) by André Malraux, often referred to Mizui about him. During the term, he, Minister of Cultural Affairs under Charles de Gaulle regime, who has deep knowledge of arts, visited the Olympic Village. He saw the wall of art and said to Mizui \\"Excellent!\\". =1% for art= In France, the law of 1951 provides that 1% of the state budget is spent on the decoration of public buildings with artwork. The majority of the works of Mizui in France are created under 1% for art. He has been built 26 sculptures between 1968 and 1982(for 14 years). For The first order from French cultural ministry was to create sculpture at Bordeaux University (department of law) in 1968, where he built Jet d'eau pétrifiée (Petrified waterjet). This request was made after his reputation towards Microcosme et Macrocosme at Winter Olympic games in Grenoble. Le Mur qui s'ouvre (Wall that Opens)(cement / 4.5m x 13 x 1.4 / 1972/ located in Lycée Louis Bascan, Rambouillet) is a retaining wall. The artist used molds of expanded polyester material that cut through the electrical resistance, a very specific technique that Mizui has obtained from his engineering background. =Symposium= Clet d'amour The sculpture symposium gave Mizui an opportunity for a new direction to develop and promote a sense of sculptural monumentality in the urban beauty. It also provided competitions among artists to demonstrate one's ability to create the same material. This movement has been achieved since 1959 in St. Margrethen in Germany. The first participation of Mizui was in Austria in 1960. He discovered the charm of work from large stone blocks of 4 meters. In 1962, he created the work, Clef d'amour (Key of Love) (stone /4m x 0.9 x 0.6) before the Berlin Wall in Germany. The new bank had the slogan of this symposium: \\"The wall to the east, creating a sculpture to the west .\\" The Symposium was awarded German critique prize. He stated \\" There is a wall between east and west. The wall he created a sad story every day. Our silent anger supported this meeting.\\" Location of the statue has been moved and currently presented at Berlin Square in Germany.Yasuo Mizui «La fête de la Carrière», articles over \\"Geijyutsushinncho\\", édition Shinchōsha Japan, The following year in 1963, he participated International Sculpture Symposium at Manazuru City, Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan, as a leader, under the financial support from Asahi Shimbun Company, where 11 other sculptors from eight different countries also participated. =Diagonal Yin Yang= There is a Fontaine-de-Vaucluse near to Lacoste where Mizui lived. This is a mysterious fountain, which has a love story, dated back to the 14th century. He stated: \\"Why not, Nachi Falls gush somewhere in France as the rain hollows constantly rocks the fountain.\\" When he visited Nachi Falls in Japan later on, his heart and body trembled in front of the cascade and he was convinced: \\" Waterfall Nachi had really pierced the earth and it rebounds into Fontaine-de-Valucluse.\\" He, at the age of 70 years old, realized \\"Diagonal Yin Yang\\" was divided between Japan and France; Two paths, two unfinished cultures. He often questions the place of the two extremes in his sculptural work where he felt caught between the Hammer (tool) and Anvil. Along with these two realizations that coexist in his work, one under the influence of another, the Yin and Yang characters are also identified by Mizui, Japan as ( Yin ), and France as ( Yang ). This assimilation takes more consistency with the movement that brings these two countries. It is in the conversation and the confrontation between the aspects Yin and Yang, which constantly oppose each other, are answered, push, and embraces he discovers, though this sculpture as a new form. River, a house, or a woman's appearance, are as Yin elements. While a flower, a tree, an animal, and a patron will generally have the character of Yang. He constantly questions the expression of his sculpture in terms of strengths Yin or Yang. He himself says \\"The response looks like a mask play between truth and falsehood.\\" Mizui heard by his friend, Tadao Takemoto, who is the writer of Andre Malraux and Nachi Waterfall; André Malraux said \\"Nachi Waterfall is the backbone of the Shintoism.\\" Diagonal Yin Yang is a series of 40 stone sculptures, made in Japan for the exhibition at Gallery Tatuno Hiranomachi, Osaka, Japan, in 1965. After this exhibition, all his works were transferred to France, in the garden of his residence in Lacoste. Two statues were offered on the occasion of the exhibition at Luxeuil-les-Bains in 2013. =Wall of Hope= In 1985, during a project with Seita Onishi, a Japanese business man, and philanthropist, Mizui was keen on the actor James Dean. Together, they had a goal, to create a James Dean Center, which would be located in Cholame, in California in the United States, near the place of the fatal car accident of James Dean.Earlier year in 1981, Mizui had been created and placed chromium cenotaph for James Dean, commissioned by Onishi, near to the place his accident. Mizui worked on James Dean Center project for three years, creating sketches and sculptures, as well as visiting the United States. Following a conflict of opinion with the owner of the proposed Center site, the project could not be fulfilled. Yet the \\"Wall of Hope\\" remains, a monumental sculpture (Limestone/13 x 4,50 x 1,20 m) dedicated to the memory of James Dean; this sculpture took three years for him to complete; it consists of 150 tons of stone extracted from the quarry of Lacoste, in the village where he lived. On one of the sides of the \\"Wall of Hope\\", he sculpted in stone the face of the film icon. \\"I said to myself, the three masterpieces of James Dean saved his fans from despair, the desperate walls open and give us the light of hope\\", the artist explains. The \\"Wall of Hope\\" was inaugurated in 2006, 51 years after the death of the actor, and, though not in California, it welcomes visitors to the garden, like an open-air museum, of Mizui, in Lacoste. =Stone and Asceticism= Mizui said: \\"Given the immense nature, I felt myself very small. In addition, the stone has rough context, but it is already so beautiful. Although I talked, insulted, and sighed him, he remained transferable and quietly annoyed in spite of my pleas and anger. However, after some time, the stone started to talk. It was he who guided me; Not so! And there! Yes, like this. If I can one day to melt into the divine nothingness, my sculpture will remain as an offering to the great nature.\\" Jean- Rosenberg, science professor at University of Poitiers, told about the sculpture of Mizui; In his non-figurative art, the temporal dimension is absent. There are no messages coded by symbols or figures. His work is cosmic. One feels the origin of life and evolution; it represents the universal entities, which have not individualized, but as they stand at the beginning of evolution.Yasuo Mizui, 50ans de Sculpture, ,2003 = Métagraphie = The technique of compressing a color between two sheets of paper or two other materials gave rise to unexpected fantastic images. The artist analyzed the causality of phenomena that may be considered accidental. In other words, it is to introduce the power of the will in the creation of such phenomena, by developing a technique and practice. This process expresses the reflection, change, succession, and the fact of going beyond, beside, and between etc. Obtained by a non-reproducible process, the métagraphie implies that the artist makes the slide watercolor on waterproof paper, then lets it have the chance to act on the matter. His own response is to find the right balance between the fluidity of watercolor and the exposure time. There are similar techniques, such as pressed oil, starch-pressed, and the decal. But the manner and the choice of material of Mizui are different. An international critic of Fine Arts, Sakae Hasegawa, said in 1984: \\"When I saw this painting for the first time, I thought this was a picture of a snowy mountain. But looking closer, it was not a picture and this picture had a strong resonance in me, it perceives cold silence. I find this painting conveys a philosophical and meditative opening, as if he could let the silence of the heart.\\".Yasuo Mizui, 50ans de Sculpture, 2003 =Four completed forms= ;1. The sculpture of the oscillation / Oscillo-Relief, 1972–1982 Oscillo-Relief cut is the shape obtained by the vertical oscillatory motion and horizontal oscillation of an electrical resistance. This free form is not the result of a prior plan, but the technique requires precise control. Oscillo-Relief is a fundamental invention of Mizui. He applied the technique to his sculptures in 1972. He was invited for The 2nd Henry Moore Grand Prize Exhibition at Hakone Open-Air Museum, in Nagano Prefecture, Japan in 1981, created Oscillo-complex(stone / 3m x 1.3 x 1.2), and received Special Prize at the exhibition. ;2. The Wall Sculpture, 1964 – \\"Cosmos\\"(stone / 15m x 18 x 0.06 / 1970 / Lycée Louis Armand in Villefranche-sur-Saône ). 360 flagstones of Comblanchien, unit of 6 cm thick, are firmly fixed on the wall. Mizui himself said, \\"I wanted to create a shadow graphics and light evoking heaven, earth and man.\\".Yasuo Mizui, 50ans de Sculpture, 2003, The wall sculpture recalls, in formal terms, Walls of Fossiles and \\"Macrocosme et Microcosme\\". ;3. The sculpture \\"Largeg Head\\", 1960–1971 \\"Hommage à Néguev (To Neguev)\\" (marble / 3.7m x 1.7 x 0.6 / 1962 / Mitzpe Ramon, Israel, Symposium) performed on the occasion of a Symposium in Israel. About this experience, the artist expresses himself in these words: It was a real brainwashing life for two months in the Negev desert. I felt my sculpture as a drop in the sea with immensity of nature. This is the first time that I could hold chisel with sincerely humble. When I made an elliptical hole in the top part, I felt that sun light was rising towards me. ;4. The Sculpture ZIG and ZAG, 1973–1974 \\"ZIG and ZAG\\" (stone / 2m x 0.4 x 0.4 / 1973 / Savannah College of Art and Design, Lacoste). Mizui first worked with blocks of polystyrene by cutting them to see the final shape of sculpture. He directed dozens of works like this. In the fifties, Parisian artists like to establish their workshop in Provence. The New Yorker painter, Bernard Pfriem, opened an art school to bring American students in the center of the village of Lacoste, France. This school is located in a large house located next to the ancient castle, The Marquis de Sade. He had remained relationship with the school for 20 years, taught students about stone sculpture every summer, and made one piece of work with them every year.

The regiment served in Egypt and Syria in 1941–1942 before returning to Australia after Japan's entry in the war. Throughout 1943 and 1944, the regiment served against the Japanese in New Guinea. The regiment's involvement in the fighting in New Guinea saw it committed to several campaigns, including those around Salamaua and on the Huon Peninsula. Its final campaign of the war was fought on Borneo in mid-1945. Shortly after the conclusion of hostilities, the regiment was disbanded in late 1945. History The 2/6th Field Regiment was raised in May 1940, as part of the 7th Division, which formed part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force that was raised for overseas service during the war. Its first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Daly. The regiment consisted of three numbered batteries: 11th, 12th, and 56th, although upon formation only the first two were raised; the 56th was created in September 1941. The regiment was raised at Ingleburn, New South Wales, but moved to Bathurst in September 1940. The following month they embarked for the Middle East. By November, the regiment was located at Deir Suneid, in Palestine. In March 1941, the regiment was planned to move to Amiriya, in Egypt, where they were to receive the remaining equipment required to bring them up to establishment, after which they would deploy to Greece; these plans were changed following German advances in both North Africa and Greece. Instead, the regiment moved to Ikingi Maryut for equipping and then undertook defensive duties around Mersa Matruh. The regiment remained in Egypt until May 1941, when it was moved to Palestine in preparation for its involvement in the Syria–Lebanon campaign. During the fighting against the Vichy French forces, the 2/6th Field Regiment was assigned to support the 25th Infantry Brigade, which advanced along the central route. In mid-June, the regiment supported efforts to capture Merdjayoun, with the 11th and 12th Batteries supporting actions around Khirbe and Khiam, and then supporting the attack on Jezzine. In response to a Vichy French counter-attack, the regiment returned to support further fighting around Merdjayoun, and then supported the 25th Infantry Brigade's continued advance towards Badarane and Rharife as part of the drive towards Beirut. The campaign ended with an armistice that was signed in mid-July. The regiment remained in Syria after the armistice, forming part of the Allied occupation force, based around Tripoli. During this time, the regiment's third battery was raised. In response to Japan's entry into the war in December 1941, the Australian government requested the return of the 6th and 7th Divisions from the Middle East. As a result, in January 1942, the 2/6th was moved to Palestine, as part of preparations to embark for Australia. Departing in February, they arrived in Adelaide, South Australia, the following month. A short period of time was spent at Woodside Camp, before the regiment moved to Casino, New South Wales, and then Caboolture, Queensland in April and May, to occupy defensive positions to respond along the east coast in case of a Japanese invasion. Gunners from the 2/6th around Port Moresby, September 1942 In September 1942, as fighting on the Kokoda Track intensified, the regiment deployed to New Guinea along with the 25th Infantry Brigade. It was initially deployed to defend against an advance on Port Moresby until February 1943, when they moved to Dobodura; with batteries deployed to Simeni, Soputa and the Kumusi River, the regiment's main role was to support troops mopping up isolated pockets of Japanese troops left in the area following the Allied counter-offensive along the Kokoda Track, and in the aftermath of the Battle of Buna–Gona. Throughout April to September, the regiment detached several elements to support US troops as part of the Salamaua–Lae campaign, landing at Tambu Bay during the Battle of Roosevelt Ridge; during this time several troops operated 155 mm guns. The 12th Battery and part of the 56th also deployed in support of the 9th Division during the landing at Lae. After November, the regiment concentrated around Finschaffen as part of the 9th Division to support operations during the Huon Peninsula campaign; when the 4th Infantry Brigade began the advance on Sio, the 2/6th Field Regiment was switched to support them until January 1944, when the regiment handed over its equipment to the 2/14th Field Regiment and embarked for Australia. Upon arrival in Australia, the regiment established a camp at Warwick, Queensland. The Australian Army's adoption of the jungle division establishment reduced the allocation of field artillery regiments to each division to one, and as a result the 2/6th was deemed surplus to the 7th Division's requirements and was reassigned to a line of communications headquarters. Without a clear role or plan for future employment, the regiment was nearly disbanded, but eventually returned to the 7th Division at Kairi, Queensland, in October 1944. Further training took place on the Atherton Tablelands until the 7th Division was tasked with taking part in recapturing Borneo. Within this plan, the 2/6th was tasked with supporting the landing at Balikpapan. A preliminary move to Morotai Island took place in June 1945. For the initial landing on 1 July, the regiment was in reserve, but as the Australians advanced inland the regiment came ashore to support the 25th Infantry Brigade as they carried out final mopping up operations before the end of the war in August. The regiment's losses in its final campaign amounted to four killed. The regiment was disbanded in late 1945. Throughout its involvement in the war, a total of 1,923 men served with the 2/6th Field Regiment of whom 19 were killed, and 61 wounded. The Australian War Memorial lists 25 members of the regiment who received decorations as a result of their service.

Fluent in French, Creole, English, Spanish, German, and Italian, she contributed to Haitian arts and literature, and founded Picolo Teatro, a performing arts school for children. She has been recognized as one of Haiti's leading literary figures as well as one of the most active players in Haiti's feminist movement. Early years and education Poujol-Oriol was born into a privileged socio-economic background in Port-au-Prince in 1926 to Joseph Poujol, active in business and the theatre, and Augusta Auxila. Her family moved to Paris when she was less than a year old, returning to Haiti when she was six, where her father founded the Institut Commercial Joseph Poujol, an educational establishment. Poujol-Oriol studied at the École Normale Supérieure in Port-au-Prince and later at the London Institute of Commerce and Business Administration in Jamaica. Career From an early age, thanks to the encouragement of her father, she became interested in culture, especially French classical literature and the theatre. In 1949, she joined the Société Nationale d'Art Dramatique (SNAD) which performed at the Rex Théâtre. She went on to teach languages, and later drama, at her father's school, and at the Collège Saint François d’Assise where she remained for 14 years. She was associated for many years with Marie-Thérèse Colimon-Hall's École Nationale de Jardinières d’Enfants. She also taught at the Theatre Department of the Ecole Nationale des Arts, which she headed from 1983 to 1991, also undertaking teaching assignments at Quisqueya University. She founded and headed the Piccolo Teatro, an organization for teaching drama to children. A feminist, for 50 years, she was associated with several women's organizations, including the Ligue Féminine d'Action Social (Feminine League for Social Action), serving as president from 1997 till her death. She was a founding member of the Club des femmes de carrière libérale et commerciale and, in 1994, of the Alliance des Femmes Haïtiennes, an umbrella body coordinating the work of some fifty feminist organizations. Her literary works focus principally on the social and economic problems of Haiti, evoking moral options and suggesting solutions. Inspired in part by the French classics, particularly the writings of Emile Zola, Guy de Maupassant, Honoré de Balzac and Alexandre Dumas, she cleverly transposes the French Human Comedy to characters from Haiti, mastering the art of developing interaction between individuals from varied backgrounds who begin to share their lives. Her French-language novel, Le creuset, and the short stories in La fleur route have significant passages in Haitian Creole. In Le creuset (1980), considered by many to be the best of her works, she traces the lives of a Haitian family over more than a century. While the novel traces a number of romances, it excels in presenting a clear overview of Haiti's evolving social difficulties, including race, prejudice, education and feminism. Poujol-Oriol's collection of short stories, La fleur rouge written in 1988, presents tales of Haitian figures seeking their fortunes. They all follow the same structure: a simple introduction, a developing intrigue and an unexpected ending. Her short story La fleur rouge which won the RFI-Le Monde prize for the \\"Meilleure Nouvelle de Langue Française\\" was republished in the Revue des deux Mondes in July 1994, receiving considerable acclaim. It has been translated into English and Spanish. Personal life Poujol-Oriol married twice. From the first marriage, which ended in divorce, she had a son, Georges Michel, a physician, and a daughter, Claudine Michel a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Second, she married Marc Oriol. She died of a heart attack in March 2011 in Port-au-Prince. Selected works In addition to many journal articles, including commentaries on the Haitian constitution and woman's place in society, her publications include: *1980, Le creuset (The Crucible), novel, Editions Deschamps, winner of the 1980 Henri Deschamps award *1992, La fleur rouge (The Red Flower), collection of short stories, the title story having won the Le Monde French-language short story award in 1988 *1996, Le passage, novel, translated into English as Vale of Tears (2006) *2008, Madan Marye et sept autres nouvelles, short stories She has also written an unpublished play, Trou-Soleil.

Nelson, 517 U.S. 25 (1996), is a Supreme court case that ruled that states could moderate national banks if doing so does not prevent or largely interfere with the national bank's ability to exercise its powers. Later, in 2004, the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) authorized its preemption rule which declared that a national bank's ability to exert its incidental powers which include lending and deposit taking inhibited state laws that obstruct, impair or condition” the business of banking.\\" Background Under the National Bank Act, there is a dual banking system in the United States: a federal system based on national bank charters, and a state system formed on state charters. Under the act, a national bank association has the power to do what is necessary for its banking business. In 1994, amongst a time of national bank expansion across state lines, Congress clearly declared its aim to create a path of freedom from state regulations by adopting the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Riegle-Neal). This act sought a new preemption standard for national banks in America by administering that national banks were subject to state consumer laws as if they were sections of a state bank except when federal law preempted the application of a state law to a national bank or if the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) concluded that a state law inclined against national banks. Courts later held that the (Riegle-Neal) act gave the OCC the ability to apply state laws even if they were not prohibited. A Florida law prohibited Florida-licensed insurance agents from engaging in certain insurance activities such as deposits and engage in any activity incidental to receiving deposits where the agent was related with, among other things, any bank than one which was not a subordinate or associate of a bank capital company, and was located in a city with a populace of less than 5000 people.

Facts  Hermosa was sailing from Richmond, Virginia, to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1840 with a cargo of slaves when she was wrecked in the Abaco Islands. Because the United Kingdom had abolished slavery in 1833, the local government forcibly removed and freed the slaves after the ship docked in Nassau in the Bahamas.  Impact  The freeing of Hermosa's slaves was widely discussed in the United States. The next year, slaves on the slave ship Creole rebelled against Creole′s crew, and chose to go to the Bahamas because they had heard about Hermosa. The cases of both ships were discussed in the United States Congress, leading to at least one call for war against Britain if compensation was not made.  Resolution  The owner of Hermosa's slaves, Robert Lumpkin, sought compensation in admiralty court. The case was dealt with together with claims related to Creole and the slave ship Enterprize, and the ship's insurers were awarded $16,000 in compensation in 1855.

The reform proposals were ultimately voted down by the pro-democracy camp. Background The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region established in 1997 was governed by the Hong Kong Basic Law, the \\"mini-constitution\\" of the region. The Basic Law set out the selecting method of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong (CE) for the first two terms and the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) for the first three terms. The selection method of the CE and LegCo was left blank for the 2007 Chief Executive and 2008 Legislative Council elections. Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45 promised that \\"the ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage\\" while Article 68 stipulated that \\"the ultimate aim is the election of all members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage\\". The politics of the constitutional reforms have dominated Hong Kong agenda since the handover, as the pro-democrats demanded all along an early implementation of universal suffrage for the CE and LegCo elections. On 26 April 2004, the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) reached a verdict stating that the elections of the 2007 CE and 2008 LegCo would not be returned by universal suffrage, thereby defeating the democrats' appeal for 2007/08 universal suffrage. 2005 blueprint In March 2005, the unpopular Tung Chee-hwa resigned as Chief Executive, citing health reasons. Chief Secretary for Administration Donald Tsang succeeded in an uncontested election with the controversy over NPCSC's constitutional interpretation. On 28 October, the Donald Tsang administration announced a blueprint for reforming the 2007/08 methods. The Fifth Report of the Task Force on Constitutional Development proposed limited reforms to the electoral methods for the 2007 and 2008 CE elections as constrained by the April 2004 NPCSC verdict. The report proposed to expand the 800-member Election Committee to 1,600, in the process of which including all 529 District Councillors, including the appointed members by the government, in order to widen the base of the indirect electorate. The government also proposed to add 10 seats to the 2008 LegCo, with five directly-elected through geographical constituencies and five functional constituencies elected by District Councillors. The government claimed that this was the best deal they could muster given the constraints of the NPCSC verdict. LegCo voting According to Annex I and II of the Basic Law, an amendment of the electoral methods of CE and LegCo requires the consent of two-thirds majority of the LegCo, which means the 25 pro-democrats in the LegCo could veto the proposal if they vote en bloc against it. Initially, the mainstream democrats, represented by the Democratic Party and the Article 45 Concern Group which combined for 12 votes in the legislature indicated their willingness to approve the proposal on the condition that the 159 appointed members of the District Councils would be excluded in the expanded Election Committee. Many in the pro-democracy were ready to approve the proposal if the amendment be made, which included the Article 45 Concern Group. Although hardliners in the camp refused to make any concession In the following weeks, the political winds shifted abruptly to a radical direction. The radical wing stepped up the call for full democracy by launching a signature campaign in newspapers. A dozen political parties and civil groups began for another mass rally just before the voting on the proposal. On 4 November, several democratic leaders met with religious leaders Bishop Joseph Zen and Reverend Chu Yiu-ming who persuaded them to vote en bloc against the government proposal. A week later, a political advertisement appeared on front pages of several newspapers showing a sandglass in black background with one written phrase: \\"Tell me, would I live to see universal suffrage?\\", addressed by \\"a 78-year-old man.\\" As a result, the pro-democrats raised their stakes by demanding a clear road and timetable to full democracy. The claimed to veto the proposal unless the appointment system in the District Councils was abolished and a clear road map and timetable were offered. The representatives from the NPCSC and Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) invited social notables and legislators from the Article 45 Concern Group to a meeting but was turned down by the group. The Chief Executive also repeatedly appealed to the public for support on television and radio programmes. The democrats launched a rally on 4 December demanding universal suffrage drew estimated 100,000 people. The high turnout strengthened the cause of the democrats to veto the proposal. On 21 December 2005, the proposal was turned down with 24 democrats voted en bloc against it, although there were continuing rumours that some might switch their position and supported it, except for Lau Chin-shek who abstained. Opinion polling A survey in late October 2005 showed that 58.8% of respondents accepted the government proposals while 23.6% disapproved, although 66% of the respondents supported a timetable for full democracy in the reform proposal . After the 3 December rally, a survey showed 49.9% accepted the proposal.

In Eastern Pennsylvania, the valley of the Panther Creek tributary of the Little Schuylkill River, a very small and relatively short mountain creek, was historically important due to its stranglehold on energy production, a key region central to the industrial development of the United States from the 1820s through the 1870s, and remained important as an energy producing region until decline of the Eastern U.S. Steel Industries in the 1960s. Panther Creek Valley lies between and over the Anthracite ladened folds of the two long near parallel ridgelines, Nesquehoning and Pisgah Ridges forming the side walls and supplying the wealth which shipped from the Panther Creek Valley making the region historically important, as for several decades its land owners, Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company (LC&N;) held a virtual monopoly on Anthracite produced and shipped not only to eastern U.S. Cities via the Lehigh Canal, but to transoceanic markets. For perspective, LC&N; must be viewed as a high-tech company of its day, as well as an early American conglomerate with efforts in many fields; a company which, from its start shortly after people learned to get Anthracite to burn, moved aggressively intelligently using emerging technologies to exploit the marked fuel shortage developing in post- revolutionary era cities and towns; wherein local wood bearing lands had gradually become scarce driving up the price of firewood, including charcoal needed for the fledgling North American iron foundries and dependent manufacturing industries from Boston to Richmond. The twin needs of heating buildings and heat for industrial processes began reshaping the world using technology by the middle of the eighteenth century in Europeeventually giving rise to public and privately funded canal projects, the use of coal, pumps so coal could be mined, steam engines, and finally rail roadsall initially coming about, so people and industries could have and use heat, overcoming the energy crises of their respective areas & eras. While somewhat delayed in time from the older fuel crises plaguing Great Britain, and continental Europe, the growing fuel shortages in Eastern U.S. cities and young industrial systems from 1800 onwards applied the same pressures; causing the same solutions to be considered locally as well, and were widely debated as public policies as the American System and implemented in part by both local business interests, and the various state governments. Business interests and local governments in the young United States, were highly intertwined and there was much regional competitiveness. So there is little surprise to find such as the Pennsylvania, New York, and Maryland legislatures all put into place proactive programs to enhance transportation penetration to the new frontiers, the Ohio Country and Northwest Territories as American's looked west and plotted settlements, manufactories, and the mindset in business was still much influenced by Mercantilism and its beliefs of a static limited market, so were focused on growing industries using the internal markets of newly settled western lands. Well before the presidential election of 1824 gave a renewed impetus to economic philosophies now called the American School, Philadelphia region private interests armed by newly publicized know-how of how to successfully ignite and sustain a clean burning fire using Anthracite, took notice of the fuel, its availability (it was discovered locally in the 1790s)...

His pen name was inspired by his later homeland's river Loudias.  Early life  Lountemis was born to a Greek family as Dimitrios \\"Takis\\" Balassoglou either in 1906 in Agia Kyriaki in Asia Minor or in 1912 in Constantinople. He was the only son among the five children of Grigoris Balassoglou (who after fleeing Turkey and finding refuge in Greece changed it to Valassiadis) and Domna Tsouflidi. His family came as refugees from Yalova after Greek genocide, and they initially settled in Aegina, then in Edessa and finally in the village Exaplatanos of Pella, where he lived from 1923 to 1932 when he moved to Kozani. He lived for a while in the state boarding house of Edessa. His family was wealthy, but bankrupted in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–22) and Lountemis had to work hard in his adolescence as a scullion, shoeblack, cantor, and teacher in villages of Almopia, and even as a foreman at the then under construction Gallikos river infrastructure works. In the 10th grade – of the six-grade secondary school of that time – he left school due to political reasons and he was expelled from all secondary schools of his country. (His engagement in left-wing politics and his political activities from inside the lines of the Communist Party of Greece cost him his expulsion from the entire school system.) Through an odyssey of successive resettlements, from Edessa to state boarding house in Kozani and then to Volos, following a wandering group of that time, he finally reached Athens and became a close connection of Kostas Varnalis, Angelos Sikelianos and Miltiadis Malakassis. The latter helped him to be appointed to the \\"Athenian Club\\" as a librarian in 1938 and financially recover. At the same time his friendship with professor of Philosophy Nikolaos Veis, would allow him to attend courses at the School of Philosophy of Athens. A lot of literary successes followed and he became a member of the Hellenic Association of Litterateurs, under the presidency of Nikos Kazantzakis.  Career He first appeared in Greek literature at very young age, publishing his poetry collections in \\"Agrotiki Idea\\" of Edessa in 1927 and 1928, which signed under his real name (Takis Valassiadis). Around 1930 he publishes poems and short stories in \\"Nea Estia\\" magazine. The first time he used his pen name was in 1934 for the short story \\"One night with many lights under a city with many stars\\" (Greek: Μια νύχτα με πολλά φώτα κάτω από μια πόλη με πολλά αστέρια). In 1938 was one of the 3 that shared the Greek National Literature Prize (the Prose section), for his short stories collection \\"The ships never came at shore\\" (Greek: Τα πλοία δεν άραξαν \\") and in 1951 Golden Daphne Award in Paris. Hellenic Association of Litterateurs established the annual \\"Menelaos Lountemis\\" award in his honor. A public building in Bucharest was named after him (Lountemis Mansion). According to Vassilis Vassilikos, \\"he is considered the most widely read Greek writer after Nikos Kazantzakis\\". His \\"One child counts the stars\\" (Greek: Ένα παιδί μετράει τ' άστρα) was a best Greek best-seller of the 1950s and the most known of his books.

The property, which is being developed for academic and residential use, is a Grade II listed building. History Entrance to the Mount Oswald estate The manor house was built for John Richardby, a London merchant, in 1800. It was bought by Thomas Wilkinson (1752-1825), a former mayor of Durham, in 1806 and it then passed to the Rev Percival Spearman Wilkinson (1792-1875), in 1828. The Rev Percival Spearman Wilkinson commissioned Phillip Wyatt to expand the house in the Neo-Georgian style in 1830. Mount Oswald then passed to the Rev Percival Spearman Wilkinson's son, Percival Spearman Wilkinson JP (1820-1898), before being acquired by the North Brancepeth Colliery Company in the 1890s. The house was acquired by North of England Estates (a business owned by the McKeag family) in 1934: North of England Estates operated the Mount Oswald estate as the Durham City Golf Club until 1967, when the golf club moved to Littleburn, and then operated it as a commercial golf course. The property was then acquired by the property developers, Banks Group, for residential development in January 2014. In August 2014 Banks Group sold part of the site to Durham University who had ambitions to use it for accommodation for 1,000 students. The project was procured by Durham University under a private finance initiative contract in August 2018. The construction works, which were undertaken by Interserve at a cost of £105 million, saw John Snow College relocating from Rushford Court to Mount Oswald, and South College, a completely new college, being created on the Mount Oswald site in September 2020. In June 2019 Durham County Council revealed plans to move the county archives from County Hall to a new history centre, which was also intended to accommodate the Durham Light Infantry Collection, in the manor house at Mount Oswald. The project, which envisaged Banks Group transferring the manor house to the council for a nominal sum, was granted planning consent in September 2020. In March 2020 Banks Group also applied for planning permission to convert the gatehouses into residential properties.

Along with her sister ship Union Rotoiti, she was unusual in that she originally had turbo- electric transmission. Construction Union Rotorua was built by Broken Hill Pty (BHP) at the Whyalla Steelworks in South Australia. She was launched on 19 January 1976. Delivery was delayed by a year and costs went over-budget by $8 million bringing the total cost to $30 million. It was subsequently acknowledged that Rotoiti and her sister ship Rotorua could have been built for half the price if they had been built outside Australia. Union Rotorua was unusual in that she was powered by gas turbine. The ship's main gas turbine / electric machinery consisted of a single General Electric MM5262RB gas turbine operating on a regenerative cycle. This was coupled to an AC generator to provide a maximum designed continuous rating of 18822 kW for a motor propeller speed of 200rpm. The turbine speed of 4670rpm was reduced to 1500rpm for the generator by a reduction gearbox. The generator output 6.6kV 3-phase at 50 Hz to the ships motors. There were four closed air circuit water cooled synchronous A.C. motors, arranged with two per shaft. Previous USSCo vessels had traditionally had twin outward turning fixed pitch propellers, however Union Rotorua has twin inward turning controllable pitch propellers. This decision was made in the interests of maneuverability, since the center of thrust is in the outer part of the disk thus giving a larger turning moment arm. In normal running configuration the whole system could be controlled by a single lever from the bridge. The speed of the gas turbine was controlled by a solid state control and safety system integrated with the propulsion controls. Union Rotorua was also interesting in its use of ro-ro for the Trans Tasman route. The cargo did not necessarily just contain truck and trailer units, but was also cargo stacked in the decks using forklifts. This necessitated the vehicle decks of the ship being build to withstand the loading of up to 39t per axle that could be exerted by a heavy forklift. Union Rotorua was built with a large angled stern ramp that allowed her to unload her cargo at any wharf without the need for a specialist linkspan as required by most ro-ro ships. She also had a bow door which could be used if a linkspan was present in a port, thus allowing cargo to be worked both forward and aft speeding up turn around time. Incidents In May 1980 Union Rotorua was on passage from Tauranga to Sydney when she broke down 200 miles west of Cape Maria van Diemen. Union Rotoiti was only 80 miles away and the two masters agreed to attempt a tow. Captain Andrew Keyworth, one of the most senior masters of the USSCo, was the master of Union Rotoiti. With much skill on his part, and while the ships were sometimes only 25 metres apart, a line was made fast between the two ships by use of a line-carrying rocket. Once the tow began 422 nm were covered in just over 56 hours at an average speed of 7.5 knots. It was a feat never before accomplished with two ships of this size, and Captain John Warren of Union Rotorua later exclaimed: ‘If anyone had previously tried to tell me it was possible … I would have thought them quite barmy’. On 29 December 1993 Union Rotorua was about 27 miles south of Sydney Heads, en route for Melbourne, when a fire broke out in the gas turbine house. It was established that the seat of the fire was in one of the cubicles of the 6.6 kilovolt switchboard, which distributed power from the gas turbine generator to the propulsion motors and auxiliary electrical systems. Initial attempts to fight the fire with extinguishers proved to be ineffective and a decision was made to utilise the fixed fire fighting medium and flood the space with CO2. This was effective in extinguishing the fire. With the high voltage switchboard out of commission, the vessel was towed to Sydney, where it remained for three months undergoing repairs. During the 1998 Auckland power crisis the four underground cables providing power to downtown Auckland all failed between 20 January and 20 February, leaving much of the downtown area without power for five weeks. Generators were brought in from across the country, however this was still not enough to power Auckland. In the first week of March Union Rotorua was brought in to supply power to parts of downtown Auckland. Berthed at Freyberg Wharf she was connected up so that her gas turbine and A.C. generator could supply power to one of the cities largest users, Ports of Auckland Ltd. This allowed the container cranes to continue to work at full speed during the outage.

She founded Canada's longest running modern dance company in 1964 called Winnipeg's Contemporary Dancers and was its artistic director until 1983. She remained with the company as a fundraiser and advisor, and continued to teach dance. She was awarded the Order of Canada in 1997 and the Winnipeg's Contemporary Dancers performance venue was renamed The Rachel Browne Theatre in 2008. She died in 2012 in Ottawa while visiting to watch a performance at the Canada Dance Festival. Early life and ballet career Browne's early dance training was in ballet and after graduating from high school she moved to New York City to train with Robert Joffrey and Benjamin Harkarvy. Harkarvy became the artistic director of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1957 and asked Browne to accompany him and become one of the company's dancers. She danced with the company until her retirement as a ballerina in 1961, citing a need to care for her young family. Formation of Winnipeg's Contemporary Dancers Upon her retirement Browne began a teaching career at the Lhotka School of Ballet. At the same time, Browne began choreographing new works. Her first piece was Odetta's Songs and Dances in 1964 which showcased an earthy modern dance that differed from her ballet training. Browne formed a new dance company in 1964 called Contemporary Dancers, which later changed its name to Winnipeg's Contemporary Dancers. Browne took on the roles of dancer, choreographer, teacher, fundraiser and administrator for the new company. She also traveled to New York yearly to study Limón and Graham modern dance technique and acquiring new dance pieces for the company. By 1970, the company was a professional dance company receiving Canada Council grants and in 1972 Browne founded the School of Contemporary Dancers to train future modern dancers. In 1983, Browne resigned as artistic director after receiving internal pressure from her company but still remained as a fundraiser and advisor. The company still continues to perform works and is the longest running Canadian modern dance company. Post-Winnipeg's Contemporary Dancers Browne's choreography underwent a change in the 1980s towards simpler, feminist works. Some of her works included Mouvement in 1992 and a collaboration in 1996 with Ann Southam called Edgelit. She also created works on dancers who represented different generations with her project called Older Woman Dance. Death Browne died on June 9, 2012 in Ottawa during a visit to see students perform in the Canada Dance Festival. Accolades Browne received the Jean A. Chalmers Award for Creativity in Dance in 1995 and awarded the Order of Canada in 1997.

Hull has had a high steward since at least 1583. The position was abolished in 1974 and revived in 2013. Before 1974 the steward usually served for life; since 2013 the term of office is 10 years. The incumbent is Peter Mandelson. History A town's steward mirrored at local level the Lord High Steward at national level. According to James Joseph Sheahan, \\"The dignity of Lord High Steward of Kingston-upon-Hull was formerly of great importance\\", but after the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 became \\"little more than honorary\\".Sheahan 1864, p.242 The corporation hoped to pick an influential figure as steward;Allison 1969 pp.113–6 conversely, the steward often influenced the choice for MPs for Hull.Allison 1969 pp.126–7 The steward was paid a regular fee and received gifts of ale. The 1661 city charter made the position in the gift of the monarch,Allison 1969 pp.117–18 permitting the council to petition the monarch to award the title to a member of the Privy Council. His duties in 1864 were \\"to present such addresses to the reigning Monarch as the Corporation may adopt, and to watch over the interests of the borough in the Privy Council\\". Hull's first steward whose name is known was Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary to Queen Elizabeth I. Sheahan says the previous steward died in 1582, but his name was not recorded.Sheahan 1864, p.86 Allison says the office of lord high steward was instituted in 1584, and first mentioned in the town charter of 1598. In 1833, the stewardship fell vacant in the divisive aftermath of the Reform Act 1832; the Mayor and Aldermen of the Corporation petitioned to have the Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington appointed, while the burgesses made a counter-petition in favour of John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham; Durham was finally appointed after the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.Sheahan 1864, p.163 Other stewards have included the Georgian-era prime minister Lord Rockingham, Hull businessman and MP Thomas Robinson Ferens, and Herbert Morrison (1956–65), a former Labour home secretary. The Local Government Act 1888 redesignated the borough of Hull a county borough which retained its civic officers. The Local Government Act 1972 abolished the county borough and officers from April 1974. In 2012, Hull City Council issued a \\"loyal address\\" to mark Elizabeth II's diamond jubilee asking for permission to revive the offices of High Sheriff and High Steward. When this was granted in 2013, the council commissioned a new chain of office for the High Steward. The chain were funded by a bequest from Colonel Rupert Alexander Alec-Smith, who had served as Sheriff of Hull between 1949 and 1950, Lord Mayor of Hull in 1970 and 1971, and Lord Lieutenant of Humberside in 1980–83. The first appointee was former Labour minister Peter Mandelson, grandson of previous steward Herbert Morrison. John Prescott, a Labour rival of Mandelson who was MP for Kingston upon Hull East from 1970 to 2010, said he was surprised it had not been discussed with him, adding \\"I also have no interest in being a steward again - I did that job on the liners for 10 years.\\" List The list of stewards whose names are known is as follows.

Hengwrt () was a mansion near Dolgellau in Meirionnydd, Gwynedd. It lay in the parish of Llanelltyd near the confluence of the River Mawddach and River Wnion, near Cymer Abbey. History Hengwrt was recorded as a grange of Cymer Abbey, and after the Dissolution of the Monasteries passed with the rest of the abbey properties to Sergeant at Arms John Powys. It was eventually bought by Hywel Vaughan of Gwengraig, after which it remained in the Vaughan family for many years.Dolgellau Character Area 5 , Gwynedd Archaeological Trust A new house was built in 1750-54 on the site of the earlier building; it was substantially remodelled in 1830, when it was refaced in stone.Hengwrt House, COFLEIN Hengwrt was purchased by William McConnel in 1859. McConnell was the owner the Sedgwick cotton mill in Manchester, one of the largest mills in operation in the United Kingdom. In January 1864, he formed the Aberdovey Slate Company which leased the Bryn Eglwys slate quarry near Abergynolwyn. He built and opened the Talyllyn Railway to transport slate from his quarry to the main line at Tywyn; he owned the railway and quarry until 1910. Hengwrt mansion was demolished in 1962 following a fire, though some of its outbuildings survive. Literary connections  Hengwrt is famous in Welsh literary history as the former home of one of the most important collections of Welsh manuscripts, the Hengwrt–Peniarth Manuscripts (often known more simply as the Peniarth Manuscripts), now held in the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. The collection was originally assembled by the collector and antiquarian Robert Vaughan, who lived at Hengwrt during the 17th century. They included treasures such as the White Book of Rhydderch, Black Book of Carmarthen, Book of Taliesin and the Book of Aneirin, along with the Brut y Tywysogion. The collection includes an important early copy of Chaucer also known as the \\"Hengwrt Chaucer\\" or, misleadingly, the \\"Hengwrt Manuscript\\". These manuscripts remained in the Hengwrt library for 300 years, although several others in the collection (including the Hendregadredd Manuscript and the lost Hengwrt 33 or Hanesyn Hên) disappeared in the late 18th century. Edward Lhuyd is recorded as having seen the antiquarian books there in 1696. A number of 18th- and early 19th-century antiquarians visited the mansion to see and copy manuscripts, including Evan Evans, William Owen Pughe and Iolo Morganwg. The collection was inherited by William Watkin Edward Wynne of Peniarth in 1859. In 1904 Sir John Williams purchased the collection from the Wynne family, subsequently donating it to the new National Library when it was established in 1907. The room in the National Library in which some of the manuscripts are displayed is named \\"Hengwrt\\", after the mansion. In the 18th century Hengwrt was the home of the diarist Elizabeth Baker. In the late 19th century it was the home of sculptor Mary Lloyd and her partner, the journalist and social reformer Frances Power Cobbe.

Eshleman then went on to direct the music video, along with most of the band's others from 2012 to 2015, and again in 2019.

Biography  A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Pope earned a Ph.D. in the Social and Intellectual History of Europe at Columbia University. She has taught history and women's studies in Hungary, Italy, France, the University of New Mexico, and Harvard Divinity School. At the University of Oregon, she was the founding director of women's studies, which was approved first as a certificate program in 1973, approved as an academic major in 1997, and became a department of the University in 2009. She has also been the director of Robert D. Clark Honors College at Oregon.  Research and teaching  Pope's 1981 Ph.D. dissertation at Columbia University was entitled, Mothers and daughters in early nineteenth-century Paris. As a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard Divinity School in 1981–1982, Pope researched \\"the meaning and public role of female symbols and saints in religious conflict and the socio-political context of 19th and 20th century France, with particular concern for their implications for models of womanhood\\". Pope has written a number of pioneering articles on women's and religious history, including \\"Angels in the Devil's Workshop: Leisured and Charitable Women in Nineteenth-Century France and England\\", and \\"Immaculate and Powerful: The Marian Revival in the Nineteenth Century\\". She was also a consultant and co-scriptwriter on a documentary film about a Sicilian Easter Procession, Processione (1989). Pope's teaching career at the University of Oregon brought recognition and awards: In 1988 she received the University's Burlington Northern Foundation award for excellence in teaching. The Center for the Study of Women in Society described her contributions to the undergraduate curriculum: > Pope was the driving force behind the 1987 UO curriculum shift that required > students to take a course focused on race and gender. Because of her > determined efforts to win innovative curriculum reform, she was the first > woman to win the Charles E. Johnson Memorial Award for \\"exceptional service > to the university and the community\\" in 1991. Pope also received a Ford > Foundation grant that helped her and colleagues develop a two-year seminar > that contributed to women of color and multicultural curriculum throughout > the country. The annual Barbara Corrado Pope Award was established at the Clark Honors College for an honors thesis \\"in the area of diversity, including gender and ethnic studies\\".  Novels  Commemorative sugar maple tree Since retiring in 2008, Pope has written a trilogy of murder mysteries set in France during the period between the Franco-Prussian War and World War I. She has published Cézanne's Quarry (New York: Pegasus Books, 2008); The Blood of Lorraine (New York: Pegasus Books, 2010); and The Missing Italian Girl (New York: Pegasus Books, 2013). She is working on a fourth novel, set in Cleveland, Ohio, and is writing short plays.Commemorative plaque from Class of 2000  Critical reception  Pope's fiction has been well received. Charles Sowerwine noted, \\"She is producing historical crime novels set in late 19th-century France, the culture to which she has devoted her life. She has added to our store of enjoyable works that teach about life in that culture.\\" He concluded, \\"Perhaps it is not fair to judge these novels as mysteries. While the plots of the three books certainly involve classic mystery devices—obvious suspects, red herrings, false clues, and unexpected perpetrators—Pope clearly wants more than to be the Third Republic's Fred Vargas; she wants to present a broad view of French society through a fictional setting.\\" Hallie Ephron wrote that Pope's \\"wonderful mysteries are steeped in history and twisted by her own uniquely subversive viewpoint\\", and observed, \\"Pope starts each book with an historical moment which offers a context for exploring issues of class, gender and social justice\\", noting finally that Pope writes \\"...as if there's a cheeky (not preachy) broad at the keyboard, not afraid to call it the way she sees it\\". Reviewer Julie Hammons, one of Pope's former students at the University of New Mexico, said there she had \\"learned to read fiction through the lens of women's experiences and began listening to the voices of women in contemporary politics and culture\\". Further, Hammons sees the influence of Pope's work as a feminist scholar in her fiction efforts.

Main staircase of the Palacio de La Moncloa before the Spanish Civil War (photo taken in 1920). Bedchamber of the Duchess, Palacio de La Moncloa before the Spanish Civil War (photo taken in 1920). The Palacio de La Moncloa before the Spanish Civil War was the old palace before it suffered damage during the Spanish Civil War, and after be rebuilt to the current Palacio de La Moncloa (being now the official residence for the Prime Minister of Spain) with a very different layout from the original.  History  The current Palacio de La Moncloa is heir to an ancient farmhouse, located in the middle of a vast agricultural estate, through which have passed marquises, dukes and kings. It dates back to the first third of the 17th century, when Gaspar de Haro y Guzmán, Marquis of the Carpio and of Eliche, took over the orchards of La Moncloa and Sora, which were located in the vicinity of the Cantarranas stream. At the highest point of the land, the Marquis ordered the construction of a mansion, originally known as the Palace of Eliche and also as Casa Pintada, in reference to the frescoes that adorned the outside walls. Apart from this fact, little is known of the original appearance of the building, but it presumably was designed with two floors and an attic, as is clear from an appraisal conducted in the 18th century. After passing through several owners, La Moncloa was bought in 1781 by María Ana de Silva, Duchess of Arcos, who undertook the first major reform of the palace, following the Neoclassical trends of the moment. After her death in January 1784, the estate passed to her daughter, María del Pilar Teresa Cayetana de Silva, the popular Duchess of Alba portrayed by Goya.\\"El antiguo Palacete de la Moncloa (1): historia y descripción\\", Pasión por Madrid In 1802 the Duchess died, an occasion that was used by King Charles IV to buy the property, with the intention to annex it to the Royal Site of the Florida. Five years later it would add the Dehesa de Amaniel or de la Villa, next to La Moncloa, also acquired by the monarch. In 1816 the building was restored by architect Isidro González Velázquez, who proceeded to its consolidation and the elimination of some ruinous elements, in addition to acting on the gardens. During the reign of Isabel II in 1846, the entire property was transferred to the Spanish State. At first it was under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Development, until the decision was made to create a museum, which was inaugurated in 1929. The adaptation works were directed by Joaquín Ezquerra del Bayo. The Civil War (1936–39) meant the virtual destruction of the property. Being in a ruinous state it was finally demolished during the government of Franco. In 1955 it was rebuilt, to be used as a residence for national and foreign personalities, mainly heads of state that are visiting Spain. The project, signed by Diego Méndez, posed a layout very far from the original. Was devised a building of new plant, with which the old farmhouse of eighteenth tastefully it transformed into a palace of great dimensions, based on models inspired in the Casa del Labrador, de Aranjuez, with touches of the architecture of the Austrias. Elements were even borrowed from other sites, such as the twelve columns of the old courtyard (actual Hall of Columns), coming from the cloister of the Archbishop's Palace of Arcos de la Llana near Burgos. With the advent of democracy, the current Palacio de La Moncloa was turned into the official residence of the President of Government and his family.  Description  The following analyzes the evolution of architectural and ornamental of the palace from the last third of the 18th century, when it reached its peak, until its destruction in the Civil War, stopping briefly on the contributions of its principal owners. The Duchess of Arcos, the owner between 1781 and 1784, put special attention on the interiors. The rooms were decorated in pseudo-classical style with abundant Pompeii and Herculaneum motifs. This period corresponds to the Cabinet of the Stuccos and the Dining room, dominated by a Tribune of musicians, and the sumptuous staircase leading to the upper floor. In the next two decades, the Duchess of Alba continued the remodel initiated by her mother, while embellishing the gardens. The Garden del Cenador, the Pond of the New Fountain and the Pond of los Barbos were some of her contributions. While her greatest contribution was the huge cave built under the palace, where a dairy was available to supply milk products to the House of Alba. This basement survived to the Civil War and in it Felipe González established his famous \\"bodeguiya\\" (a cellar). For his part, Charles IV did not make too many reforms. Still, a mahogany staircase was installed in the lobby and an office was created, for personal use of the sovereign, in one of the bedrooms. In the time of Joseph Bonaparte, the decor was renewed. This task was undertaken by architect and painter Juan Digourc, of French origin. With regard to the restoration of Isidro González Velázquez, his work was decisive in stopping the deterioration process which was taking place in the palace, and also made some buildings of new fact, between them a House of Crafts. But, undoubtedly the most important restoration was undertaken between 1918 and 1929 by the Spanish Society of Friends of Art, under the direction of Joaquín Ezquerra del Bayo. This restoration was particularly thorough and sought to recover of the appearance that the palace had in the 18th century, as it was to be converted into a museum. So much was this spirit in mind that, for example, they managed to discover the Greek decoration the Duchess of Arcos had ordered to perform to her bedroom and front bedroom, hidden under different layers of paint. The gardens of the estate deserve special mention, in which the prestigious painter and gardener Javier Winthuysen Losada intervened in 1922.

He was a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1884 to 1885, representing the electorate of Cook.  Early life  Campbell was the son of John and Catherine Campbell (née Johnson).Marriage certificate for Thomas CampbellDeath certificate for Thomas Campbell He married Mary Aloysius Hanley (b. 1850, Westport, County Mayo, Ireland) at what is referred to today as the Old St Stephen's Church in Brisbane on 11 January 1873. Research is ongoing as it relates to Campbell, particularly prior to his arrival in Australia, however, it appears, subject to confirmation, that he arrived in Maryborough, Queensland on the marine vessel Sultana in July 1864. His future wife, Mary, arrived in Brisbane with her parents, Edward and Mary Hanley (née McNeave) on the marine vessel Golden Dream in May 1863. The Hanley family lived in Maryborough. After their marriage Thomas and Mary resided in South East Queensland (predominantly Gympie). Campbell was headmaster at Gympie Central State School from May 1876 to December 1882 having taught initially under the Department of Public Instruction's pupil teacher system at Fortitude Valley in Brisbane (-1870), Maryborough (1870-1872) and Spring Creek near Warwick, Queensland (1873-1876). In December 1882, Campbell made his transition to the legal profession.  Politics  In August 1883 at a public meeting in Mackay, Queensland, Campbell condemned the policies of the then Premier, Sir Thomas McIlwraith, and informed those present that he had great faith in Sir Samuel Griffith who was subsequently elected Premier of Queensland in November 1883. Following Campbell's election to the Queensland Legislative Assembly on 4 March 1884 in the Cook electorate, he continued his support of Griffith, which suggests that from an ideological standpoint that he was of liberal thought as opposed to conservative. Campbell was declared insolvent on 27 July 1885 and he tendered his resignation from the parliament. As had occurred on a previous occasion when a member was declared insolvent, it was thought proper for the Queensland Parliament to move that the seat be declared vacant by reason of the insolvency of the member. On 4 August 1885 the then Premier, Samuel Griffith, moved: \\"That the seat of Thomas Campbell hath become and is now vacant by reason of the insolvency of the said Thomas Campbell since his election and return to serve in this House as one of the members for the electoral district of Cook.\\" The question was put and passed.  Later life  Thomas Campbell's headstone at West End Cemetery, 2012 The oral history handed down through the generations was that the transition from teaching to the legal profession was a financial challenge for Campbell so much so that initially it was not successful and with his premature death, his future prospects in what was a new employment venture was not achieved. Campbell died in Townsville at the Imperial Hotel on 6 November 1885, aged 40 when he was visiting North Queensland on a court case and was buried in the West End Cemetery in Townsville. According to The Gympie Times, \\"he had been laid up at the Imperial Hotel for three days with an attack of asthma, but on Friday he was seized with convulsive fits, which continued until his death, the cause of which is said to have been Bright's disease\\" and that he was \\"a fine scholar and a man of great natural ability and application - as is shown by the fact that whilst fulfilling his responsible scholastic duties, he, quite unaided, managed to qualify himself for admission to the bar\\".  Family  Wife Mary (nee Hanley), circa 1915Campbell was survived by his wife, Mary (a primary school teacher) and their four young children. After Campbell's untimely death, Mary returned to Maryborough, and the latter part of her life was spent in Rockhampton, Mount Morgan, Queensland and Brisbane. Mary died at her residence, 26 Riverview Terrace, Auchenflower, Queensland, on 13 October 1927 aged 76. She was survived by their three daughters, Mary, Kathryn and Esther. Mary Angela, a teacher, was the eldest daughter, born Spring Creek (Warwick) in 1875 and died in Newcastle, New South Wales in 1967. She married Terence Lafferty (BA University of Sydney) who worked alongside TJ Ryan at their first respective postings in Queensland as teachers in 1899 at the then Maryborough Grammar School (note: TJ Ryan acted as best man at the wedding of Mary and Terence at St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Maryborough on 13 April 1903).

He was the first crew member aboard the USS Housatonic to spot the H.L. Hunley before it sank the USS Housatonic. The sinking of USS Housatonic is renowned as the first sinking of an enemy ship in combat by a submarine. Biography =Early life= Robert F. Flemming Jr. was born free in Baltimore, Maryland, in July 1839, the eldest child of Robert F. Flemming Sr., a baker, and Mary Jane (Holland) Flemming. By 1850 the family had moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Flemming (age 12) had four new siblings: John (age 10), Catherine (age 5), George (age 2), and Mary (an infant). Flemming Sr. died soon after, and Mrs. Flemming opened a boarding house in Cambridge while the three oldest children went out to work.\\"United States Census, 1860\\", database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MZC8-36X : 30 December 2015), Mary J Flemming, 1860. =Service in the Civil War= Robert Flemming was working in New York City as a marble cutter when he enlisted in the United States Navy on May 14, 1863. https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-sailors- detail.htm?sailorId=FLE0006 He was rated as Landsman (rank), the equivalent of the current naval rating of seaman recruit. His first posting was to the USS Wyoming (1859) the following June; he was present when the sloop engaged the naval forces of the Japanese Empire at the Naval battle of Shimonoseki on July 16 of that year. \\"The Battle of the Straits of Shimonoseki,\\" http://www.navyandmarine.org/ondeck/1863shimonoseki.htm =Attack on USS Housatonic= The following October, Flemming transferred to the sloop of war USS Housatonic (1861), which was sent to join the blockade of Southern seaports as part of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. On the evening of February 17, 1864, Flemming was on watch when he noticed a strange object in the water about 400 feet off the starboard bow. He alerted the officer of the guard, who dismissed the object as a log. \\"Queer-looking log,\\" Flemming replied. Taking a closer look, he soon realized that the \\"log\\" wasn't floating with the tide, but was actually coming at a high rate of speed toward the Housatonic. Shouting that there was a torpedo approaching the ship, Flemming alerted the rest of the crew, who started to get the Housatonic under way. However, it was too late; there was an explosion and, within five minutes, the Housatonic sank in 25 feet of water with a loss of five crewmen.The Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion; Series I – Vol. 15, p. 335. The crew immediately began climbing the rigging or entering life boats as the sloop began to sink; once it hit bottom, however, the masts and rigging were still above the water, and Flemming and others hung on for forty-five minutes until help arrived.Brian Hicks, \\"One-Way Mission of the H.

L. Hunley under the command of Lieutenant George E. Dixon with a crew of seven volunteers. The Hunley thus was the first submarine to sink a warship in combat. From his vantage point in the rigging, Flemming noted a blue light to the starboard of the Housatonic, which was later surmised to have been the crew of the Hunley's prearranged signal to friendly forces to light bonfires to guide the crew home. However, the Hunley never returned, leading to one of the great mysteries of the Civil War.Brian Hicks, \\"One-Way Mission of the H. L.

The dispute began in 1969 and was largely resolved by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2002, which opined that both of the islands belonged to Malaysia.  Background  Ligitan and Sipadan are two small islands located in the Celebes Sea off the southeastern coast of the Malaysian state of Sabah. Sovereignty over the islands has been disputed by Indonesia and Malaysia since 1969 and intensified in 1991 when Indonesia discovered that Malaysia had built some tourist facilities on Sipadan island. Indonesia claimed that it had made a verbal agreement with Malaysia in 1969 to discuss the question of sovereignty over the islands. Malaysia however denied the allegation of an agreement between them, maintaining that the islands have always been part of the territory of its state of Sabah. Both countries have not delimited their maritime zones in the area and the court was not asked to rule on this further matter. On 2 November 1998, both countries agreed to bring the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). = Government of the Philippines request for intervention = The Philippines had applied during the proceedings to intervene over the case on the basis of their claim to northern Borneo. According to the Philippine side, the heirs of the Sultan of Sulu has ceded their rights over North Borneo (present-day Sabah) to the Philippines in 1962. However, a majority of people in the territory chose to become part of Malaysia in 1963 rather than the Philippines under a plebiscite organised by the United Nations. The Philippines motive to intervene was questioned by the court, as to whether the Philippines had a \\"sufficiently strong legal interest\\" with both Indonesia and Malaysia. The court strongly rejected the Philippines' attempt of intervention and in doing so cited that the request made by the Philippines did not relate to the subject matter of the case. The Philippines query was totally dismissed in June 2001 when after oral hearings the court voted it down by a count of fourteen votes to one.  Court decision  Both of the islands were originally considered as terra nullius. But as Malaysia's predecessor, Great Britain, significantly developed the islands compared to Indonesia's predecessor, the Netherlands, especially after Malaysia's formation as a nation the court using this as the main reason decided to award the islands to Malaysia based on their \\"effective occupation\\". In addition, it is also acknowledged both of the islands were much closer to Malaysia than Indonesia as well with an earliest documentation from Malaysia over the British 1878 Agreement with the Sultanate of Sulu during which time they acquired the Sultanate area as part of the British Borneo, while the Indonesian claim is mostly based on an 1891 Boundary Treaty between Great Britain and the Netherlands.

Secrecy Knowledge of its existence was very carefully guarded as a wartime secret. anecdotal correspondence 4 years after 1945 correlating the \\"secrecy\\" of the base However, in August 1945, newspaper reports openly acknowledged the impact of the forces' activity. History =Background= At the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 29 US submarines were based at Manila, Philippines, as part of the United States Asiatic Fleet, which were attacked by the Japanese on 10 December 1941. One of those, the , was sunk while the remainder escaped to sea. From the Philippines, some these submarines escaped to the Dutch East Indies, from where they operated in the following two months. When the bases at Surabaya and Tjilatjap were also overrun by the Japanese, these submarines escaped further. Initially, Darwin was considered as a base but the facilities there were insufficient and within striking range of land-based Japanese aircraft. Consequently, Fremantle, which was well out of reach of land-based Japanese aircraft, became the main base of the US submarines, with the first ten arriving by 10 March 1942.Sturma, p. 9 Apart from the US submarines, three Dutch submarines also arrived in Fremantle at the time, while four others of the Dutch submarines had escaped to Ceylon.Sturma, p. 12 Fremantle provided a safe, large harbour but had the disadvantage of being far away from the submarines' patrol areas and being difficult to reinforce should a Japanese attack take place. Despite this remoteness, experience taught the US command to be cautious and to split the submarines in Fremantle and send five of them and a submarine tender, the , even further south on 15 March, now to Albany, where the Holland stayed for the next four months.Sturma, p. 13 =Emergency of March 1942= The establishment of the base was directly related to what was known as the Japanese Scare of March 1942, the most significant event for Western Australia being the attack on Broome. The base later became a major US Navy facility, with submarines based there attacking Japanese shipping throughout South East Asia. It involved mainly submarines from the US navy, but also included submarines from other forces.Sturma, p. 1 =1942= Following the retreat from the Philippines, Captain John E. Wilkes, who had supervised the retreat, became the first commander of the submarines based at Fremantle, a role he held from March to May 1942. Under Wilkes, the submarines heading out on patrol from Fremantle sank only a modest amount of tonnage, but this was largely due to the fact that the boats were utilised for special missions rather than outright patrols, specifically, supplying and rescuing troops in the Philippines.Sturma, p. 20 & 21 Wilkes was replaced by Captain Charles A. Lockwood on 22 May 1942, who held the position until December that year. Lockwood's first task was to raise the morale of the submariners under his command, which he perceived as being very low because of the constant retreat they had experienced until then.Sturma, p. 27 Lockwood's other tasks were to replace the aging S-boat submarines in his command with newer models and to deal with reliability issues with the Mark 14 torpedos used, which were found to run deeper than set in trials ordered by him, causing them to miss their targets.Sturma, p. 37 & 38 Altogether, 26 US submarines carried out 61 patrols from Fremantle during 1942, sinking 40 enemy ships in the process.Sturma, p. 44 =1943= In January 1943, Lockwood became the head of submarines in the Pacific, with Captain Allan R. McCann acting as his replacement until Rear Admiral Ralph Waldo Christie took over permanently a month later.Sturma, p. 45 The first half of 1943 brought only limited success for the submarines based at Fremantle. The number of patrols per month remained low, at four. With the low number of patrols, the number of sunken enemy ships was also low, at a confirmed total of 19 with a tonnage of 87,350. Worse, with the loss of which had to be abandoned by its crew after being damaged, the base also lost its first submarine. Attempts to establish a base further north, at Exmouth, to cut the necessary travel time to the patrol areas for the boats by two days each way, also failed because of unsuitable conditions and a lack of infrastructure there.Sturma, p. 58 The second half of the year saw a turnaround of events for the Fremantle submariners. All up, 32 patrols were conducted during the six months, sinking 47 enemy ships with a tonnage in excess of 200,000, more than doubling the success rate of the previous six months.Sturma, p. 66 & 67 Having previously gone twelve months without a submarine loss, the second half of 1943 saw the disappearance of , only three month after the Grenadier but, unlike the latter, the were no survivors of the Grayling.Sturma, p. 55 =Emergency of March 1944= Like in March 1942, two years later, in March 1944, Western Australia was once more beset by fears of a Japanese attack. Unlike in 1942, when a potential Japanese invasion was the main concern, this time a naval attack was feared. As a consequence, two of the submarine tenders were relocated south to Albany, submarine crews were recalled from leave and the boats send out to form a protective cordon for the port. Aircraft and ground forces were mobilised as well but the scare passed within two weeks and operations quickly returned to normal.Sturma, p. 76 =1944= Samuel David Dealey (left), commander of the , a boat successful in six patrols until sunk by the Japanese with all hands lost in August 1944 The first half of 1944 saw another increase in patrols, number of ships and tonnage sunk, despite the fact that March, because of the fears of attack, saw only tow patrols go out. The number of submarine patrols from Fremantle was increased to an average of nine and 75 enemy ships were sunk in the period, with a tonnage of almost 320,000. April 1944 saw the best monthly total so far, accounting for almost a third of the six month total.Sturma, p. 83 After no submarine losses from Fremantle for almost a year, July and August saw the loss of three submarines in quick succession, , and . Harder was lost without survivors while four of the crew of Robalo may have survived the initial sinking, but not captivity. Of the crew of Flier, at least thirteen survived the initial sinking but only eight of those made it ashore. Uniquely, these eight were rescued and returned to Australia without ever falling into Japanese hands, being helped by Filipino Guerilla fighters and picked up by another US submarine.Sturma, p. 97-104 The second half of 1944 saw the arrival of British submarines at Fremantle, which previously had been engaged in the Mediterranean, then moved to Ceylon and, finally, to Western Australia. The first to arrive was the HMS Porpoise, on 10 August, followed by the depot ship HMS Maidstone in early September while the eleven submarines attached to the ship first carried out patrols in the Strait of Malacca before arriving at Fremantle as well. It was the first time that Royal Navy ships were based in Western Australia, with the contingent also including two Dutch submarines.Sturma, p. 105 While the new base was very popular with the British submariners, offering superior opportunities for recreation between patrols, in comparison to Ceylon,Sturma, p. 109 the remote location meant the submarine patrols were longer than the previous short ones from the island. With 52 days on one patrol from Fremantle, HMS Tantalus set a new record for the longest patrol of a British submarine during the war so far from October to December 1944.Sturma, p. 114 Commeorative plaque for HMS Porpoise and Operation Rimau in Rockingham, Western Australia British submarines, smaller than their American counterparts, were predominantly used in shallower water, and against smaller crafts, which they attacked with their deck gun rather than torpedos. This approach carried a number of risks, it being harder for a submarine to hide in shallow water and the gun crew being exposed to enemy defensive fire.Sturma, p. 115 & 116 British submarines based in Fremantle were also heavily involved in special operations. Porpoise became the first British submarine to go on patrol from Fremantle in September 1944 and was selected, because of its size, to carry Western Australia-trained members of the Z Special Unit on the unsuccessful Operation Rimau.Sturma, p. 117 & 118 The second half of 1944 proved to be the pinnacle of the war efforts of the US submariners based in Fremantle. In 83 patrols, the boats sank 105 enemy ships at a combined tonnage of 445,000.Sturma, p. 125 Admiral Christie, in charge of the Fremantle submarines since 1943 and overall commander of all US submarines in Australia for a brief period in November and December 1944, was informed of his upcoming replacement soon after. Christie was most likely replaced because of his insistence of having the late Samuel David Dealey, commander of the Harder, decorated with the Medal of Honor, something he did succeed in once back in the US. His replacement, Rear Admiral James Fife, took over on Christmas Day 1944.Sturma, p. 128 =1945= The first two month of 1945 saw a continuation of the success rates of 1944 for the Fremantle-based submarines, sinking 27 enemy ships with a total tonnage of 77,000. The following six months, until the end of the war, this dropped off however, with exactly the same number of confirmed sinkings in the final half a year of the war for submarines from Fremantle, the number of larger enemy targets sharply dropping off during the final stage of the war. This figure does however not include craft under a tonnage of 500, which the Joint Army–Navy Assessment Committee did not count in this figure.Sturma, p. 138 Smaller crafts of that size or below were often sunk with deck guns rather than torpedoes.Sturma, p. 139 There had been some reluctance to attack smaller crafts earlier in the war but, in May 1944, the British Admiralty, allowed the sinking of such vessels in the Far East.Sturma, p. 116 British submarines consequently sank 300 such craft in 1944 and another 400 in 1945. The US submarines only accounted for 200 such vessels in 1944 but tripled this figure in 1945. With the reconquest of the Philippines, US submarines returned to bases there. Subic Bay was first used in February and James Fife relocated his headquarters there in May 1945. Fremantle was still used as a base while Subic Bay, with its very basic facilities, was not a popular location for British and American submariners.Sturma, p. 141 Dutch submarine , operating from Fremantle, was lost in July 1945, when it struck a reef while on its way to Subic Bay. The crew was able to be rescued by , which had to destroy the O 19 to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.Sturma, p. 147 The last of the Fremantle-based submarines to be lost during the war was the , sunk on 6 August 1945, the same day an atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima.Sturma, p. 149 With the end of World War II, US submarines soon left Fremantle, the last one on 31 August 1945, while British submarines remained in Australia for the time being.Sturma, p. 154 From 1942 to 1945, submarines based at Fremantle sank 377 ships, 340 of those sunk by American boats, this figure not including small crafts. The combined tonnage of these 377 ships was 1,519,322 tons. The Japanese government and its leaders at the time ranked the destruction of the Japanese merchant navy through submarine warfare as one of the root causes for the country's defeat.Sturma, p. 152 On the US side, 22 percent of all submariners on patrol during the war lost their lives,Sturma, p. 150 and only eight of the 43 US submarines lost during the Pacific War had survivors.Sturma, p. 152 Utilisation When it was fully active the base saw 160 Dutch, American and British submarines pass through the harbour. in the summary text of the collection: \\"Fremantle played as an allied submarine base during World War II when come 160 Dutch, American and British submarines undertook patrols from there. Between 1942 and 1945, on average, one allied submarine departed Fremantle for a patrol every three days. Some 11 submarines were lost after departing Fremantle, representing the loss of some 800 submariners' lives\\". The base was tied in with the Indian Ocean campaign of 194245. Military historians looking at the strategy in the South East Asian Theatre look upon the command of the Commander Submarines, South West Pacific (COMSUBSOWESPAC), and the facility of the Fremantle base as integral to successes in 1943 onwards.Submarine Matters: Fremantle During the war, 127 US submarines operated from Fremantle, carrying out 353 patrols. Additionally, ten Dutch submarines also operated out of Fremantle and, from August 1944, British submarines also started operating from the base. Altogether, submarines based in Fremantle accounted for 416 patrols during the war.Sturma, p. 2 Of the US submarines operating from Fremantle, eight were lost on patrol while a further ten formerly based at Fremantle subsequently were lost while on patrol from another base. One Dutch and one British submarine were also lost while operating out of Fremanlte. Installations HMAS Ovens Various buildings and properties in Fremantle were requisitioned as part of the support of the base, and remained so until late 1945.Chadwick, Claire (1995) Details of base operated during World War 11 in Port weekly, 2 Oct. 1995, p.11. Other facilities further from the coast were also utilised for support, such as the Byford armament depot, which stored torpedoes and mines. Also anti-aircraft gun installations were set up near the base. 4000 tons of ammunition including torpedoes was stored at US Navy 137 – 7 Naval Ammunition Depot (7NAD) at Springhill, near Northam. Construction of a slipway for the maintenance of submarines and other vessels was begun in 1940 and completed in September 1942. The slipway was in use until 1998 and is now home to HMAS Ovens as part of the Western Australian Maritime Museum.Sturma, p. 43 Coastal defences for the seaward approaches to Fremantle, the Fremantle Fortress, included batteries on Rottnest Island (2), the suburban beaches between Swanbourne and Point Peron at the lower end of Cockburn Sound (3), Garden Island (4), as well as at the mouth of the harbour (2).Map on page 6 of Mckenzie-Smith's Defending Fremantle – Map 1 – Coastal Defences of Fremantle, separating into Rottnest (on Signal Ridge near the central lighthouse), Mainland (at Fremantle Artillery Barracks, now the Army Museum) and Cockburn Sound (Southern Fire Command mid Island north of current marine base) – relating to the 3 names of the command posts for the batteries Heavy anti- aircraft gun stations were concentrated mostly along the coast around Cockburn Sound. The northernmost was at Cottesloe, and the southernmost was at South Rockingham.McKenzie-Smith identifies over 15 stations, with the North and East Fremantle ovals and Buckland Hill (Mosman Park) with the heaviest allocation of troops on the guns – see page 14, Map 2 'Heavy Anti-Aircraft Gun Stations' of Mackenzie Smith Defending Fremantle Light anti-aircraft gun sites were much more confined to the Fremantle Harbour area (8) and Swan River, Melville Water area (6).page 17, Map 3, Mackenzie Smith Defending Fremantle Also there were 20 anti-aircraft searchlight stations as back-up to the gun stations.page 21, Map 4, Mackenzie Smith Defending Fremantle Effect on community In 2014, the work by Deborah Gare and Madison Lloyd-Jones When war came to Fremantle 1899–1945 gives a pictorial and textual understanding of the impact of the allied servicemen associated with the submarine base. specific reference to the allied servicemen and the submarine base pp.106–115 Also collections of oral history in Battye Library include numbers of people remembering from their childhood the impact of the base, and of American servicemen living in Perth in the 1940s.Edmondson, Bernard, 1924– [Interview with Bernard Edmondson] [sound recording] / [interviewed by John Roberts].1994 and [Interview with Mr and Mrs Wilson, Shirley and Homer White, Mrs H.G. Barnesby and Mrs Burrows] [sound recording] / [interviewed by K. Bostock].1976. Unlike Eastern Australia, where relations between American soldiers and the local population at times soured, the submariners remained popular with the Western Australian population. Many of the American sailors saw Fremantle and Perth as the best spots in the Pacific for leave during patrols.Sturma, p. 4 Western Australia saw far less US service men pass through than the eastern States, where up to 100,000 US military personnel were present at its peak. Submariners also saw themselves as an elite force and had undergone careful selection and training for their roles.Sturma, p. 81 & 83 For the isolated Western Australian population, the presence of a submarine base at Fremantle also alleviated the fear of being abandoned and defenceless, especially in the early stages of the Pacific war when the state felt under threat of a Japanese invasion or attack with very limited defences.Sturma, p. 16 African American submariners based in Fremantle reported being treated well and without prejudice, in contrast to the East Coast, where the first contingent arriving in Melbourne in 1942 was barred from landing by custom officials, something overridden by the US.Sturma, p. 36 They were however forbidden contact with Aboriginal Australian women, something enforced by both the Western Australian police and the US military. Despite this, African Americans and Aboriginal Australians did socialise together in so-called safe houses.Sturma, p. 35 Submarine tenders and assisting ships   Refits and repairs Submarines known to have been repaired or refitted at Fremantle include: * Losses The numbers of submarines lost that while operating out of the Fremantle submarine base included:Sturma, p. 2 Lost in 1943  Lost in 1944   Lost in 1945  * Dismantling base and facilities In September 1945 at the end of the war, the dismantling of the submarine base included the being involved with removing submarine repair facilities.

Originally, Mass was said in a room situated above 14 to 16 Henshaw Street. Later, this moved to a room above the Harp and Shamrock Public House. In 1829, with the increasing size of the congregation, a former Unitarian chapel on Lord Street was leased by Fr James Fisher.Oldham - St Mary from English Heritage, retrieved 6 February 2016 Construction When the lease expired, money for a new church was raised by a Fr Adam George Fisher, nephew of Fr James Fisher. In 1837, building work started on the church. The architect was Matthew Ellison Hadfield. On 3 March 1839, the church was opened. From 1844 to 1857, the burial ground was used. In the 1850s, the Lady Chapel and baptistery were added. In 1861, the church was damaged by anti-Catholic and anti-Irish rioters. Most of the damage was to the church windows. In 1867, the church was reopened after an extensive renovation. It was funded from money raised by Fr Grymonprez. It is the earliest Catholic church in Oldham. =St Patrick's Church= Foundation In 1858, St Patrick's Church was founded as a chapel of ease of St Mary's Church. Fr Conway bought an existing chapel on Foundry Street to say Mass in the centre of the town. In 1862, the church became independent of St Mary's Church. That year, plans were made by a Fr Brindle for a larger church to accommodate the increasing size of the congregation. The site of the church on Union Street was given by John Lees Ainsworth. Construction On 28 March 1869, the foundation stone of St Patrick's Church was laid. The church was designed by Thomas Mitchell, an architect from Oldham. The building firm was Finnegans of Manchester. On 5 June 1870, the church was completed and the first Mass was said. Developments In 1873, a new high altar and reredos was added. It was designed by George Goldie. In 1898, the presbytery was built. The next year, in 1899, the schools on Foundry Street were rebuilt. From 1906 to 1907, the interior was reordered as new floors, side altars, confessionals, altar rails, a side porch and new seating were added.

It is based on a species originally published as Hygrophorus marchii by Giacomo Bresadola in 1928, but with an insufficiently precise description, which later led to conflicting interpretations about the species concept. In 1969, Reid gave a precise description of the fungus common in Europe, but Kühner had a different interpretation of H. marchii, and gave a new name to Reid's concept of the species. The fungus makes reddish-orange to reddish fruit bodies with dry, smooth caps. The flesh has an odour of honey, particularly when the tissue is rubbed, or when it is drying. It is found in Europe, and reported from eastern North America, although it is uncertain whether the North American population represents the same species.

The film's French version title is À la suite de nos armées viendra l'entraide.  Synopsis  In 1943, the UNRRA was created by the United Nations to render aid to nationals from the Allied nations. By 1944, desperate families in war-ravaged Europe, were fleeing their homes and ruined cities, and with their expanded mandate to assist all in distress, only UNRRA could provide relief. Following intense fighting on the European continent, close to 30 million Europeans were refugees, fleeing before both advancing and retreating armies. With little more than the scant possessions they could carry, the refugees were confronted with a wasteland with food, water, and infrastructure devastated. The lives of thousands in occupied countries have become the responsibility of the Allied governments as they continue their advance into Nazi Germany. With all semblance of order gone, most of the territories in which UNRRA operated was in the midst of political chaos. UNRRA cooperated closely with volunteer charitable organizations, who would work alongside the United Nations agency. In its first years of operation, UNRRA distributed food, fuel, clothing, shelter, medicine, tools, seeds, fertilizer, farm implements and other basic necessities at a time of severe global shortages and worldwide transportation difficulties. Canada, alone, provided five million tons of wheat, while the United States joined with Canada to provide other food stuffs. The work of UNRRA would continue into the postwar years. Like the earlier commitments made at the United Nations' conferences on food and agriculture, UNRRA endeavoured to take on the task of relief work throughout Europe to build a stable postwar future, making the world safe and free from fear and want.

The recurring television character (portrayed by Alycia Debnam-Carey) does not appear in the books on which the series is based. The commander of the allied Grounder clans, Lexa is proven to be a reasonable leader and strong warrior. She considers love a weakness, a view significantly impacted by the death of her girlfriend, Costia. Though she starts to show romantic feelings for Clarke Griffin (leader of the Sky People) and takes Clarke's views into consideration, Lexa puts her people first, even at the expense of losing Clarke's trust. Lexa has been well received by critics and fans, who consider her to be one of the show's more interesting and complex characters. She has been a source of frequent debate, particularly for how she was written out of the series. Her relationship with Clarke, which was viewed as compelling, significantly impacted the LGBT community and many viewers embraced it as a positive or tempestuous depiction of friendship, love and betrayal. The relationship was, however, criticized for being unnecessarily tragic, leading to a national debate about the \\"bury your gays\\" trope. Appearances =Season 2= In \\"Fog of War,\\" two days after a massacre, mechanic and explosives expert Raven discovers Mount Weather has jammed communications, preventing them from reaching out to other potential survivors from the Ark (a ship that held descendants of humans who survived the nuclear apocalypse 97 years before). The survivors become known as Sky People to the Grounders (descendants of humans on Earth who survived the nuclear apocalypse). After a group of survivors finds the communications tower, they are forced to split and take shelter from an acid fog. Clarke, a teenager who has taken on a leadership role for her camp, realizes she no longer recognizes Finn, her one- time lover. Jaha and Kane, two former leaders of the Ark, are told that one of them must kill the other to have even a chance at speaking with the commander of the Grounders. Kane attempts to take his own life rather than kill Jaha, but a Grounder witness, Lexa, reveals herself to be the commander and says she believes their wish for peace is sincere. She allows Jaha to escape with a message to his camp: leave within two days, or die. In \\"Long Into an Abyss,\\" with the Grounders' deadline imminent, Abby (Clarke's mother) and Jaha disagree over what the survivors are to do; Jaha wishes to evacuate to the so- called 'City of Light', while Abby wants to remain behind to rescue other members. Clarke and two of her fellow people (Octavia and Bellamy) hold Lincoln in the dropship; he is a Grounder and was experimented on with a serum to become a reaper (a mindless, zombie-like killer). When Lincoln is almost mercy-killed, his heart stops and he is revived by Clarke, who believes curing reapers depends on waiting for the serum to leave their bodies, even though the reaper might temporarily die in the process. With this information, Clarke realizes they have something to offer the Grounders. When Abby is successful in curing Lincoln, Lexa grants Clarke the truce but says she must be allowed to execute Finn before it can begin. In \\"Spacewalker,\\" Clarke returns to camp and tells them the Grounders will cease their attack if they are given Finn, who is the one who massacred a number of their people. The tension between the people in Camp Jaha rises as opinions are divided on whether to give Finn to the Grounders or not. At the camp, Abby and Kane, having returned, think they can bargain with the Grounders by offering to put Finn on trial, but such plans are wasted as Finn gives himself up to the Grounders. In the end, Clarke goes to meet with Lexa in a last-ditch effort to save Finn from the brutal execution process Lincoln has explained. When Lexa refuses clemency, Clarke asks if she can say goodbye to Finn. She approaches, kisses him, and tells him she loves him while stabbing him in the heart, killing him quickly. Several of the Grounder chieftains are angered by this mercy-kill, but Lexa declares the demands have been met and the truce will stand. In \\"Remember Me,\\" Clarke and a group from the Ark set off to a Grounder camp (Tondc) to complete their agreement for a truce. On the way, Clarke is haunted by visions of Finn. Bellamy tries to convince Clarke to let him go to Mount Weather as an inside man; Clarke says she cannot lose him too. When they arrive at the village, Clarke burns Finn's corpse, along with the corpses of those he killed, in a traditional Grounder funeral. While grieving, Lexa tells Clarke of Costia, her own past love who was tortured and killed by Lexa's enemy, who believed she knew Lexa's secrets. She tells Clarke that love is weakness. At a dinner, Kane gifts Lexa with a bottle of liquor. When Gustus, her right hand, tests it for her, he appears to be poisoned, leading Lexa to believe it was an assassination attempt by the Sky People. Clarke immediately thinks it was Raven, as she was Finn's former girlfriend and loved him. Clarke confronts her; Raven punches Clarke for accusing her of doing it. Lexa nearly kills Raven, but Clarke figures out that the bottle was not poisoned, and proves it was the cup to Lexa by drinking from the bottle herself. Bellamy then accuses Gustus, saying that it was one of Lexa's own people. Gustus confesses and Lexa kills him. When Lincoln confronts Bellamy about how he knew it was Gustus, he says Gustus would do anything to protect Lexa. Clarke decides she sees Lexa's point about how love is a weakness and tells Bellamy he was right and should go to Mount Weather. In \\"Survival of the Fittest,\\" Clarke and Lexa encounter a gigantic mutated gorilla after one of the grounder council members drives Clarke into the forest with the intent to kill her. They escape but become temporarily trapped in its cage. Lexa is injured, but that does not stop her from dispensing some advice about leadership to Clarke. Clarke figures out a way to escape and also has an idea about freeing the Grounders inside Mount Weather to help fight the Mountain Men. \\"In Rubicon,\\" bone marrow experiments at Mount Weather are proven to work; people at Mount Weather, who had been prisoners to the place due to their anatomy being incompatible with Earth's radiation, can now possibly roam the land; Cage, son of Mount Weather's leader Wallace, plans to destroy any chance of peace between the Grounders and people of Mount Weather by launching a missile. Clarke races to the village where she explains the danger to Lexa. Lexa points out to Clarke that if they warn anyone else and stop the meeting, the Mountain Men will realize they have a spy inside the mountain and Bellamy will be compromised before having completed his mission. Clarke is reluctant to leave so many others to die but agrees Lexa is right and the two secretly escape. As they leave, Clarke sees her mother arriving in the village and returns to try to rescue Abby as the missile hits the village. In \\"Resurrection,\\" Clarke and Abby survive the missile strike on Tondc, but Abby is horrified to realize Clarke knew it was coming and did nothing to save the rest of the people in the village. She goes back to help survivors, while Lexa and Clarke set off to find and kill the spotter who called in the strike. Clarke finds and kills the spotter with Lincoln's help, and realizes the spotter's lack of a hazmat suit means the Mountain Men have started harvesting her friends. Inside Mount Weather, Jasper (a friend of Clarke's) and the others fight back and find refuge with those in Mount Weather who do not agree with Wallace or Cage. In \\"Bodyguard of Lies,\\" Clarke and Lexa rehash the plan of attack, and Lexa tells Clarke she (Clarke) was born to be a leader. Octavia figures out Clarke and Lexa knew about the missile, and Lexa decides she needs to be killed to protect that secret. Clarke stops the attempted murder. She confronts Lexa about her plan and her facade of heartlessness, and Lexa reveals she has feelings for Clarke. As they wait for the deadly fog to clear, Lexa informs Clarke she does trust her and will no longer try to hurt Octavia. She notes that the Grounder ways are just focused on survival. Clarke suggests that maybe life should be about more than just surviving, and Lexa catches her off guard with a kiss. Clarke returns the kiss before she tells Lexa she is not ready to be with anyone yet. They are alerted to Raven's signal that the fog is disabled. The combined grounder/arker army marches to war with Clarke and Lexa at its head. The Mountain Men prepare to deploy acid fog, but Bellamy manages to escape a security team and destroy the system in an explosion just in time. In \\"Blood Must Have Blood: Part 1,\\" Bellamy frees the Grounders inside Mount Weather, as Clarke's plan is to attack from within. When the generators are taken out, soldiers from Mount Weather open fire on the army in front of their doors, but those still manage to destroy the lock at the last second. When they pull the door open, Lexa commands her people to stand down because of a deal she just cut with the Mountain Men. When the Grounders retreat, almost all of the Sky People accept defeat and soon retreat, leaving behind only a betrayed Clarke at the front door and Octavia in the tunnels. =Season 3= In \\"Wanheda: Part Two,\\" attackers on a jeep turn out to be Arkers who landed separately. Their numbers have dwindled to 63 due to conflict with the community called Ice Nation and they accept Kane's offer to come to Arkadia, where the other Sky People live. Part of the group continue to search for Clarke, who has been on the run for three months due to now being a legend and subsequent target because of her defeat of the Mountain Men after Lexa's betrayal. This has earned her the nickname \\"Wanheda\\" (commander of death). Indra, one of Lexa's best and most trusted warriors, warns Lexa that the Ice Nation is marching on her; Indra is there when bounty hunter Roan (the banished Ice Nation prince) brings Clarke to Lexa, who sought to capture Clarke before members of Ice Nation did. Still angry at Lexa for her betrayal, Clarke is dragged out kicking and screaming while vowing revenge on Lexa. In \\"Ye Who Enter Here,\\" Clarke struggles with taking revenge on, as well as forgiving, Lexa. Lexa tells Clarke that she intends to initiate the Sky People into her coalition as the thirteenth clan. Clarke believes Lexa only wants this because her (Clarke's) defeat of the Mountain Men has made Lexa look weak. Lexa focuses on sparring with Aden, a Nightblood she has been training for the role of Commander. Nightbloods are Grounders with black blood; they are the only Grounders who can become commanders. As Titus (Lexa's right-hand man and former mentor) wants Lexa to kill Clarke because he feels that Clarke has weakened her reputation, Roan suggests that Clarke kill Lexa. In the end, Clarke cannot do it and Lexa apologizes for her betrayal. Emerson, the last survivor of Mount Weather, is revealed to be alive. In \\"Watch the Thrones,\\" in a fight to the death for the right to the throne, Queen Nia chooses her son Roan to fight Lexa. Lexa bests Roan but kills Nia instead of him, and pronounces Roan the king of Ice Nation. She and Clarke later bond as Clarke tends to her wounds. In \\"Hakeldama,\\" Clarke, Lexa, and other Grounders discover an army of fallen Grounders, slain by Pike (the new and destructive leader of the Sky People) and his followers. Indra is found wounded and says Bellamy persuaded Pike to let her live in order to tell Lexa that the Sky People reject the newly-formed coalition. Lexa allows Clarke's return to Arkadia to tell Bellamy and the others to step down. Clarke fails to convince Bellamy, but convinces Lexa to end the cycle of violence in hopes of peace. In \\"Bitter Harvest,\\" Lexa worries that by trying to make peace instead of engaging in war, she is betraying the commanders who came before her. Clarke assures her that her legacy will be peace. Roan has Emerson, the last Mountain Man, delivered to Clarke; she must decide his fate. She ultimately decides to let Lexa banish him. In \\"Thirteen,\\" the Grounders celebrate their Ascension Day, a holy day for Grounders. Octavia and a man named Semet walk in claiming the Sky People destroyed their village. Discussing the situation, Titus wants Lexa to destroy the thirteenth clan while Clarke thinks they just need time to take out Pike from the inside. Speaking to everyone, Lexa orders the armies not to attack, but instead make a perimeter around Arkadia and says that any Sky Person found past the five-mile buffer will be killed. Semet is angry at this and attempts to kill Lexa, but is stopped by Titus who kills him. Later, Titus is against Clarke staying, believing she further endangers Lexa's life. He warns Lexa that, just like with Costia, she may not be able to separate feelings from duty. Lexa is enraged at this, reminding him that because she let Ice Nation into her coalition even after they cut off Costia's head and sent it to her bed, she is more than capable of separating feelings from duty. Later, Clarke goes into Lexa's room and realizes she is saying goodbye. Clarke says the reason she is going back is because the Sky People are her people. Lexa says that this devotion is what makes Clarke the person she is. Clarke suggests that maybe someday they will owe nothing more to their people, and Lexa responds with \\"May we meet again.\\" Clarke kisses her and they have sex. It is later, as Lexa is running into Clarke's room, that Lexa is accidentally shot by Titus, who intended to kill Clarke. Clarke catches Lexa as she falls and they take her to the bed. Lexa realizes she is going to die and tells Clarke not to be afraid. She tells Titus to never harm Clarke again, and he swears he will not. She tells him to serve the next commander as he served her. Clarke continues to try and save Lexa, but she tells Clarke that her spirit will find a new commander. She says her fight is over and that Clarke was right that life should be about more than just surviving. Clarke recites the Traveler's Blessing, an Arkadian prayer. As Lexa dies, Clarke kisses her one last time. Titus extracts a tech from Lexa's neck, where her tattoo is. The tech is called \\"the Flame,\\" and it is revealed to be Lexa's spirit. She was augmented to carry an AI (the Flame). The Flame is how every new Commander is chosen, with each new Commander becoming a part of the Flame. It is only compatible with Nightbloods. Aden is meant to succeed Lexa, but, in \\"Stealing Fire,\\" he is murdered by Ontari, a rogue Nightblood who seeks the throne for herself. In \\"Perverse Instantiation—Part Two\\", Clarke is on a mission to stop a holographic AI named ALIE from world domination which requires her to take on the Flame, the AI Lexa once carried. Clarke is implanted with the Flame with the help of a blood transfusion via a brain-dead Ontari. To control people, ALIE has them swallow a chip that takes away pain (emotional or physical) and connects them to a virtual reality called \\"the City of Light.\\" In this city, the minds of those who have died live on. Clarke takes one of ALIE's chips and enters the city to stop ALIE from within. In a moment of distress, Clarke subconsciously calls upon Lexa to help her. Lexa's consciousness, saved in the Flame, appears in the City of Light to help Clarke fight off ALIE's mind-controlled minions. Aided by Raven's hacking against ALIE's minions, Clarke is led to a room resembling the Polaris space station, where the consciousness of Becca (ALIE's creator who was also saved in the Flame) shows her the kill switch to destroy ALIE. Before Lexa sacrifices herself to get Clarke to safety, Clarke tells Lexa that she loves her. Lexa says that her spirit will always be with Clarke. = Season 4 = In \\"Echoes,\\" 4x01, the season four premiere, it is discovered that the people killed by Lexa in the City of Light in order to protect Clarke also died in the real world. King Roan honors Lexa's last wishes for Clarke's sake and her people. In \\"We Will Rise\\", 4x06, Clarke wakes up looking over at her drawing of Lexa from season 3. Niylah wakes up telling Clarke \\"Lexa would be proud of you.\\" referring to saving their people from Praimfaya. = Season 5 = In \\"Damocles, Part 1\\" of season five, it is revealed that Lexa's consciousness is still in the Flame. Lexa passes a message to Clarke through Madi that abandoning her at Mount Weather was Lexa's greatest regret and helps to convince Clarke to do the right thing. = Season 7 = In \\"From the Ashes\\" of season seven, one of Madi's drawings from the memories of the Commanders in her head is from Lexa's memories of \\"Ye Who Enter Here.\\" In \\"The Queen's Gambit\\" of season seven, John Murphy and Sheidheda argue if Lexa or Sheidheda is the preferred Commander amongst the Grounders. Though Murphy points out that Lexa united the clans, Sheidheda argues that it was himself and not Lexa who accomplished that feat. Sheidheda compares himself to Lexa, stating that they were both killed by their Flamekeepers who were afraid of their ideas. In \\"The Dying of the Light\\" of season seven, Lexa in the City of Light appears amongst the memories of the Commanders when Levitt and Bill Cadogan dig through Madi's mind. = Series Finale = In \\"The Last War,\\" the series finale, the Judge takes on the form of Lexa in the final test to determine if humanity will Transcend or be annihilated. This is because the Judge appears to an individual as a great teacher, or mentor, or their greatest love. For Clarke, her greatest love was Lexa so the Judge took on her form, solidifying in the series Lexa is Clarke's greatest love. The Judge, as Lexa, would appear once more before Clarke on the shores of a lake, informing her Madi is safe and that her friends chose to not remain transcended and stay with her on Earth. The Judge in Lexa's form has the last words in the series stating, \\"A curious species, indeed.\\" Development =Casting and creation= Show creator Jason Rothenberg said he and others involved with the series were aware of Debnam-Carey while casting Clarke in 2014; although the chance for her to portray Clarke never materialized, her name was brought up while casting Lexa. He called the casting a \\"no-brainer\\"; she did not audition for the role, but was rather offered it. At the time, Debnam-Carey was also being considered for the role of Alicia Clark on Fear the Walking Dead. \\"That's always a concern when you have an actor in your show that is popping—that someone else is going to grab them and make them a series regular if you don't. That's kind of what happened in this case,\\" stated Rothenberg, who considered Debnam-Carey's performance on The 100 \\"amazing\\". He added, \\"You know we can't compete on some level with the cache of a franchise like that, with the numbers.\\" Debnam-Carey was allowed to continue work on both shows. Rothenberg said he would have done the same had it been the other way around, with creators asking to borrow one of his actors, and he would have done his best to make the situation work. Of the dramatic shift from one show to the other, Debnam-Carey stated, \\"It was super weird, it was like 'I have no power anymore! No weapons, no power!' But maybe eventually, Alica will be able to have her own kind of power.\\" Lexa, with \\"such an iconic look and distinct wardrobe,\\" was an alien role for Debnam-Carey. She stated, \\"I signed on for this role at a time in my personal and work life when there was a little bit of a lull period. I was like, 'I don't know what I'm doing!' It was one of those actor freak-out moments.\\" She said when the chance to portray Lexa presented itself, she was excited because of the quality of the show and its actors, and because the character allowed for a multifaceted dynamic; this resulted in Lexa being the character she has favored portraying thus far. \\"Thankfully, (show creator) Jason [Rothenberg], the creative team, the writers, and the hair and make-up are very collaborative,\\" Debnam-Carey said. \\"They're really willing to create something. And that's what's so lucky about this show. It never started with expectation, so we've been able to embrace it and really make it our own, and that's been wonderful.\\" From top to bottom: Lexa on her throne in war paint and Grounder attire; captures showcasing the wardrobe from different angles. Rothenberg said he and his crew do some research with regard to depicting societies, such as the Grounders, within the series, but most of what is shown is based on his personal tastes. He enjoys the world-building aspect the most. \\"Getting to create this universe from the language to the wardrobe to the tattoos ... we obviously get pretty deep into what the grounder spirituality is and means,\\" he stated. \\"All of that is pretty awesome. So yes, we do some research as to how societies have evolved in the past but for the most part it's fiction.\\" Rothenberg said there are more than just men writing the show; there are several women \\"writing hardcore sci-fi.\\" In 2015, two commander jackets were described as being \\"made out of leather, metal, and fur\\". Debnam-Carey felt that the Grounder culture—the language, wardrobe, makeup and \\"all the symbolic meaning behind that\\"—was \\"one of the highlights\\" for her. \\"We explored it as much as we could as actors to break down its meaning, but the best thing about this was finally finding out all this backstory and fully creating this world,\\" she stated, adding they \\"had three sets built just for the Grounders\\". Dany Roth of blastr.com was impressed by the show's costume designs, stating that they are \\"possibly the best on TV right now. Each costume tells the story of the world, of the people, of the specific character.\\" He said that, like Mad Max, The 100 \\"understands that the Grounders are repurposing tools and clothing from a time long dead. But the costumes are far from uniform. The people who lived on the ark, the people who live in the forest, the people who live in a frozen tundra, they all dress differently.\\", and although \\"there's fashion here that makes the clothes exciting\\", it is the clothes that tell the story. \\"I've said this many times before and I'll say it again here,\\" he added, \\"a good costume makes a good actor a great one. Costumes make a show's world real.\\" Maureen Ryan of Variety, formerly of The Huffington Post, stated that the \\"most enduring image of Lexa is one of her sitting on a throne made of intertwined branches, her enigmatic eyes looking out from a face half-covered in elaborate war paint.\\" Debnam-Carey said, \\"I'm lucky they put me in such a badass costume and makeup. It's funny, we did a whole day of tests with that makeup. We were like, 'Should we do this? Should we do tears? Should we do the bindi?'\\" She collaborated with Rothenberg on the makeup and wardrobe for her character, and both collaborated with viewers on fan versions of the designs. When developing the character of Lexa further, the idea of her being romantically interested in women was pitched. \\"It just made complete sense. The moment, I think I'm remembering it now, the moment was in Episode 9 when Lexa tells Clarke the story of Costia at the fire after the funeral, and she talks about Costia—that was the first reference, I think, to her sexuality,\\" stated Rothenberg. He \\"embraced it and [ran] with it.\\" =Personality and portrayal= The writers designed Lexa as a proud and wise warrior who keeps her feelings very guarded, and as someone who is usually unable to show she cares for people. The vulnerability that results from caring, and particularly loving a person, is something she views as a weakness. This was significantly exacerbated by the death of her girlfriend, Costia; the anger, grief and subsequent dissipation of the grief hardened Lexa further. In addition, having been selected commander involved her going through a brutal training process, as is their society's custom; if she shows weakness in her duties as a commander, she can lose the respect of her warriors. Debnam-Carey said figuring out how to portray all these aspects of the character was the most challenging part. \\"For me, it was about finding that mix between vulnerability and tension and a wiseness beyond her years,\\" she said. A director advised her that less is more, and she adapted to the character, and learned more about her, via portrayal. \\"I realized that I was slowly developing all of these things. Someone was like, 'Is it a thing you've chosen to do, to not blink all the time?' I was like, 'Wow!' When it comes to Lexa, she's very steely-gazed, all the time. There's a presence about her and a knowingness, and she's always observant.\\" By making calculated choices, she is used to getting what she wants. Lexa is the first Grounder leader to seek peace, which Debnam-Carey described as \\"somewhat difficult\\" for the other Grounders to understand because of their \\"rough and aggressive\\" culture; she is also \\"the first person to unite the 12 clans and to actually have the option of an alliance.\\" Throughout, she is extremely loyal, but more so to her own people; she puts them first regardless of the cost. Debnam-Carey said \\"it's in [Lexa's] blood\\" to put her people first because they \\"are so close to her, that's what she's been groomed to be. She comes from a really harsh culture and she has huge responsibilities.\\" Lexa is \\"brutal and she's a pragmatist, but not out of unkindness. It's all she's ever known.\\" Debnam-Carey did not view Lexa as a teenager, and did not assign her an age, stating, \\"It's almost like she skipped that period. She was placed in a position where suddenly she was forced to make a lot of hard choices that most people never have to make, no matter what their age is. The 100 is a world where you don't ever really get to be a kid.\\" =Relationship with Clarke= Lexa's relationship with Clarke is presented as intense, complex, and the one thing that manages to soften Lexa's outlook on life. Debnam-Carey said the characters progression from being allies to becoming romantic \\"stems from a connection that they both share—which is similar experiences and similar positions\\" in that they are \\"both very young leaders with great authority, a lot of responsibility. They have to lead a huge amount of people. They have a lot of expectations riding on them.\\" She said the sudden responsibilities they faced, the need to make the right decisions, and the fact they both grieved over past lovers helped connect them further, and it is a connection they do not have with others. Rothenberg originally stated that while he would not go as far to say that it was love at first sight for Lexa, \\"it definitely was a bit of a thunderbolt moment for her when she first saw Clarke.\\" He said Clarke's attraction to Lexa \\"developed a little bit more slowly, but by the end [...] they were very much intrigued at the possibility of a romantic relationship.\\" He later said \\"Lexa was definitely smitten—like love at first sight, probably\\", but maintained it took longer for Clarke to develop romantic feelings for Lexa. Debnam-Carey considered the characters being \\"very adaptable\\" as one of the interesting aspects of their dynamic. Sacrifices the characters make are \\"for a much greater goal in the end\\". They have also \\"taken characteristics from each other,\\" with Lexa becoming more trusting and learning that love can be empowering, and Clarke becoming more ruthless. \\"It's very interesting to see the way they ebb and flow with each other,\\" said Debnam-Carey. Of Lexa possibly putting Clarke first instead of her own people, she said perhaps if \\"Clarke was able to assimilate to their culture as well and become more of a right-hand man, then maybe I think Lexa could—then that would be a merger of two people.\\" Lexa's weaknesses, as indicated by Debnam-Carey, are her feelings for her people and Clarke. Debnam-Carey appreciated the fact the writers did not make a big deal of defining either characters' sexuality or their romantic relationship. Show creator Rothenberg said labels and gender are not a factor in the series, which Debnam-Carey viewed as true to the story. \\"[It's] just a world where people love people for who they are and not what they are and that creates such a broad variety of characters. It is representative of the world that we live in today, but it also doesn't make it out to be this statement—it's not a social/cultural statement,\\" she said. \\"It is just that in this world, some things are a little better after the apocalypse [...] It kind of represents, in a way, an ideal place where people love people and it doesn't have to be a thing, which I think is really great.\\" Of the decision to have Lexa betray Clarke, a significant moment for the series that allowed the writers to strain the characters' relationship, Rothenberg said Lexa was under the impression Clarke would likely die in the battle and Mount Weather would possibly remain to keep her people united. \\"She was probably—master strategist that she is—thinking several moves ahead. Thinking she could keep her alliance together, the 12 clans, because they would still have this evil empire out there to unite them,\\" he stated. Lexa was not expecting Clarke to win, and to subsequently become a legend. \\"Everywhere she goes it's like, 'I heard it was 5,000 people! No, I heard it was 10,000 people!' Everywhere she goes, [Clarke's] a legend now,\\" said Rothenberg. \\"Certainly it means that her alliance now no longer has a real reason to be held together. [...] I'm really excited to play out the ramifications of all of that.\\" Rothenberg said Clarke would eventually come to terms with the likelihood that, if she had been in a similar position as Lexa, she would have done the same thing: Protect her own people at all costs. He said she did as much in the season 2 finale. \\"That was kind of the theme of the entire season, which was how far can you go and still be the good guy in order to save your people. Lexa had that choice in [Episode] 15. Obviously, it landed very emotionally for both of them, but especially on Clarke,\\" he stated. \\"In [Episode] 16, Clarke had a similar choice and I hope that over the course of the first part of [season 3], Clarke will eventually come to see it that way. If she can't, then they'll never figure out a way to make peace with each other\\". Debnam-Carey viewed the betrayal as a relief and release for herself as an actor, and as a \\"very honest\\" and \\"open\\" moment for Lexa. \\"It's the first real time you get to see—apart from [them sharing a kiss]—this is a scene where she makes a really strong choice, but you can see that it's hard for her to do, and she does care,\\" Debnam-Carey stated. She said Clarke's portrayer, Eliza Taylor, was \\"brilliant\\" and \\"great to work with and between the two of us, we were just very connected with each other and made sure that that was the strong force of that scene.\\" To Debnam-Carey, Lexa \\"showing that she cared, even in that moment of betrayal\\" was Lexa being real. Debnam-Carey argued that even though Lexa was upset by the betrayal, she is a very hardened person and her people continued to be her main concern. She does not think Lexa was preoccupied with the repercussions. Unlike Rothenberg, Debnam-Carey felt \\"[Lexa] always knew [Clarke] was going to [survive]. Now those cards are back on the table, if she wants to restart an alliance or whatever else.\\" In the series finale, the fact that the Judge took on Lexa's form served to confirm that Lexa was in fact Clarke's greatest love. Reception =General= Lexa, and her relationship with Clarke, have been well received by critics and fans. Maureen Ryan, writing for The Huffington Post, stated, \\"In a show packed with morally compromised characters, Lexa stood out; she led a tribe of Earth inhabitants named Grounders with a combination of deftness, intelligence and unhesitating ferocity.\\" Ryan felt Lexa \\"does not suffer fools gladly, yet Debnam-Carey made Lexa's vulnerability and her attraction to Clarke Griffin (Eliza Taylor) not just believable, but engrossing.\\" Linda Ge of TheWrap referred to her as a fan-favorite, while Eric Goldman of IGN called her \\"a standout, highly popular character\\". The staff for SheWired stated that she \\"had the best character introduction ever and never stopped being great\\" and \\"has proven to be endlessly engaging, even when she's making choices that make us want to crawl into a ball and cry.\\" Dana Piccoli of AfterEllen.com characterized Lexa as a \\"mysterious queer character\\" that has caught the audience's attention, and complimented the \\"chemistry and increasing bond between Lexa and Clarke,\\" adding, \\"Both are smart, and somehow manage to see the bigger picture. [...] Here are two young women, leading their people to salvation or at least as close to salvation as they can get.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle reasoned that Lexa's resolve while facing the reality of protecting the Sky People, the 13th clan, while risking an uprising from the other clans and her own people \\"is exactly what makes her one of the better characters on TV.\\" Hypable.com's Selina Wilken said that she was \\"one of the best and, yes, most divisive characters in recent TV history.\\" Many viewers were upset by Lexa's betrayal of Clarke, resulting in debates about why she may have done it, and Andy Swift of TVLine's stating, \\"I'm pretty sure I speak for Clarke, and all the angry viewers watching from home, when I say, 'Lexa, please meet a fiery death. ASAP.'\\" Mariya Karimjee of Vulture viewed \\"the hurt and confusion that washed across Eliza Taylor's face\\" during the betrayal as \\"one of the most powerful performances\\" she had seen on the show and said the heavy, emotional struggle came from both characters, with Clarke realizing \\"Lexa is the only person who understands her.\\" Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club stated that having the characters reunite after the betrayal, \\"allows for the show to dig into one of its most complex and compelling relationships. Clarke and Lexa are a tangle of emotions and motivations. [...] They share a connection on an emotional level, a romantic level, and they recognize the burden of responsibility that they each have taken on.\\" Fowle felt \\"Clarke's relative forgiveness of Lexa makes sense within the context of the war of her people, and the larger political conflict at hand. When she kneels before Lexa [...], it's loyalty informed by weeks of patient storytelling.\\" Whether or not Lexa should be paired with Clarke was also debated, especially by fans of the Bellamy and Clarke relationship (\\"Bellarke\\"), which is canon in the books. This resulted in a rivalry between the fanbases. In 2015, Sydney Bucksbaum of E! Online stated with regard to season 2, \\"People who want to see Bellamy (Bob Morley) and Clarke (Eliza Taylor) get together—ahem, in every sense of the word—have had to suffer through a full season in which they were actually separated for pretty much the entire time.\\" Rothenberg told Bucksbaum that he was not dismissing the pairing; rather the Bellamy and Clarke romance was not yet the focus. He said the show gives indications that Bellamy and Clarke care deeply for each other, and those wanting a romance at the time should read the books. \\"We played with the Lexa/Clarke storyline [in season 2] and that [was] still ongoing because both characters [were] still breathing,\\" stated Rothenberg. \\"The journey is long, and eventually we'll be able to tell that story in all its glory.\\" He said when it came to whether or not the series would end with Clarke and Lexa as a couple, he would not comment on the matter and knew where he wanted the series to go, but he was always open to better ideas. Eliza Taylor also weighed in on the matter, stating that she loves that bisexuality on the show is portrayed as normal, and that she also likes the chemistry between Bellamy and Clarke. =LGBT community= Clarke and Lexa's relationship had a significant impact on the LGBT community. Dalene Rovenstine of Entertainment Weekly stated that the series \\"has featured unexpected twists (a baby in space! a human harvest chamber! cannibals!), the shocking deaths of multiple main characters, and amounts of blood and gore you wouldn't expect to be approved on network TV. But none of those moments have created a stir quite like [...] when [Clarke and Lexa] locked lips.\\" The kiss was trending on Twitter after it aired, and many fans created artwork of the characters and couple as the series progressed; others engaged in cosplay of Lexa (dressing up like the character), with some receiving input from Debnam-Carey and Rothenberg. Debnam-Carey was surprised by the attention. She was new to Twitter and Instagram, and did not know what shipping (the desire by fans for two people or fictional characters to be in a romantic or platonic relationship) meant; she saw that fans had given the pairing the portmanteau \\"Clexa\\". \\"I was on Instagram or something and I checked my tagged photos, and I realized that suddenly they were all LGBT artwork. I was like, 'Oh, my god!' I had no idea. It was the first time I realized I was a figure for that community,\\" said Debnam-Carey. She called this \\"an honor\\" and \\"flattering,\\" and added, \\"It's new for our society, as well. It's one of the first shows that really has two characters in the cast that are gender and sexually fluid and embraces that. There are no labels. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of. I'm all for it.\\" While at Paleyfest 2016, she was made aware of fans raising money in her name for The Trevor Project, an organization for LGBT teenagers in need, and the fact that, at the time, $46,000 dollars had been raised. When asked if she knew she had that much of an impact on the LGBT community, Debnam-Carey commented, \\"Not that much, no, that's amazing.\\" As of July 13, 2016, over $135,000 dollars have been raised. Selina Wilken of Hypable.com appreciated that the show had \\"subtly introduced [its] first queer character\\" and that it is free of the other \\"big issues in today's society,\\" like gender stereotyping, racism or misogyny, but felt the writers had been heteronormative with their romances before that point, which she characterized as \\"bizarre\\" for \\"an imagined future where marginalization\\" no longer exists. \\"In a media landscape where gay, lesbian and bisexual characters are still often defined mainly by their sexuality, having Lexa—one of the show's strongest, most well-liked characters—casually reveal that she's queer and then carry on with her day sends a strong and important message to young viewers,\\" stated Wilken. \\"However, there's a big difference between having a supporting character (however brilliant) play the pronoun game, and actually featuring a same-sex pairing on the show.\\" She said The CW did not have \\"a single queer main character on any of the network's currently running shows\\" and that needed to change. \\"The next step, obviously, is the visual: The 100 has made it pretty clear that gender, race and sexuality are not issues worth bringing up in conversation, which is great,\\" said Wilken. \\"But then, following this Show-Don't-Tell approach, how about actually featuring a same- sex pairing on the air? Give her a love interest, however fleeting. The ball's in your court, writers.\\" To this point, Rothenberg had Clarke have sex with a different woman in season 3 (while parted from Lexa) to make it clear that Clarke is bisexual, ensuring she would be viewed as a lead LGBT character. =Exit from the series= Fan reaction With Debnam-Carey's limited role on the series, Rothenberg contemplated how best to continue or end Lexa's story. When he chose to kill her off, this resulted in much animosity among the fanbase, with viewers and critics (especially those who were upset or confused by the decision) debating whether she was killed off for being lesbian, and whether she was killed off the right way; many also felt the decision was a blow or slight to the LGBT community because of the view that it reinforced the \\"dead lesbian syndrome\\" (or \\"bury your gays\\") trope, which posits that a lesbian couple (or other same-sex couple) on television or in film can never be happy for long, if at all, because one or both of them will soon die. Viewers expressed their anger on Twitter, Tumblr, and other social media sites, with a number of them threatening to dox (reveal personally identifiable information about) the writers, others making death threats, and some stating they were suicidal after watching the episode; people associated with the show immediately responded and tried to ease their thoughts, and defended the series by stating characters die on the show all the time. A number of fans compared Clarke and Lexa's final moments together to the death scene involving Willow Rosenberg and Tara Maclay from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, finding both moments unjust. The \\"bury your gays\\" trope rose to a national debate, and the international fan-led initiatives \\"Lexa Deserved Better\\" and \\"LGBT Fans Deserve Better\\" emerged, initially dominating Twitter. The Trevor Project was also borne out of the backlash, and had \\"raised more than $30,000 (£21,000) in just a few hours.\\" Critical analyses Calling the uproar messy, Caroline Framke of Vox said killing off Lexa \\"may have alienated part of [the audience] for good. [...].\\" She argued that \\"on the one hand, [Lexa's] death was gut wrenching, and it unexpectedly brought together several disparate story strands in The 100 's floundering third season. On the other, Lexa was an openly queer woman leading 12 armies, a rare sight for LGBTQ representation on television. Less rare, unfortunately, is the trope of television and movies killing gay women off for shock value.\\" Framke was especially critical of the show having Lexa die immediately after having sex and pillow talk with Clarke, which were long-awaited scenes; to Framke, this signaled \\"sex, love, death\\", particularly for lesbian couples. Eric Goldman of IGN argued similarly, stating, \\"No, no, no, no, no. [...] If there's one thing I truly hate about how Lexa's death was handled, it's this.\\" Feeling that this setup was \\"really trite and cliché\\", and made worse by the dead lesbian trope, he commented, \\"While I don't think The 100 writers ever intended to imply 'sex = death,' it ended up coming off that way.\\" He felt fans of the couple \\"were truly manipulated and treated poorly\\" and that, given how important the couple was to people, they deserved more time to see them happy. \\"To the LGBTQ fandom who looked at Lexa as important, I can sympathize,\\" he said, \\"but as a straight white male, I wouldn't dream of saying 'I totally get it.'\\" Goldman, like Framke, however, felt Lexa's death was a good opportunity to propel the show's story of artificial intelligence (AI) with respect to Lexa forward. \\"If The 100 is smart—and it usually is—Lexa's death will be the defining moment of the season,\\" he said. Variety's Maureen Ryan, who expected Lexa to eventually die, and called Clarke and Lexa's love and deathbed scenes spectacular, said the season had been rushed and Lexa's death after sex with Clarke \\"was another case of the show compressing a timeline to an unfortunate degree.\\" Ryan argued that the way a character dies matters, particularly for LGBTQ characters, given their under-representation and misrepresentation in the media. She listed scenarios with pros and cons about how the show might have better played out the Lexa factor, including the suggestion of Lexa never being in season 3. While Bethonie Butler of The Washington Post stated that part of what fueled the outrage is that The 100 was thought to be \\"progressive in its treatment of LGBT characters,\\" and so the death led to feelings of betrayal, Hypable.com's Selina Wilken said that \\"Season 3 did a lot to build Lexa up before her fall, turning her into an almost King Arthur-like figure of salvation in this broken world, at least partly in an effort to blind-sight and devastate the audience when she died. (And... mission accomplished, all too well.)\\" Butler added, \\"The controversy reveals the pitfalls of a show misunderstanding its audience and the politics of minority representation onscreen.\\" Trish Bendix of AfterEllen.com, on the other hand, challenged the outrage, stating that while LGBT visibility matters, fictional characters of color (including transgender characters of color) do not get a tenth of the attention that white television characters do. She hoped to see viewers care more about these characters going forward. The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle felt that while \\"it's certainly frustrating to see one of TV's prominent lesbian characters written off so hastily,\\" the show made Lexa's death mean something. In his opinion, episode \\"Thirteen\\" is \\"a remarkable episode, one that deepens the mythology of The 100 while also delivering on a number of character threads that have been left dangling for much of this season so far.\\" Damian Holbrook of TV Insider argued that, despite assertions to the contrary, television writers and producers never hastily kill off a character. \\"They are humans who come to love their casts and their characters as much as we do, but they are also ultimately telling a story.\\" Liz Shannon Miller of IndieWire opined, \\"The outrage over the show falling prey to the 'lesbian death trope' was epic—in a season full of death, Lexa became an icon for how LGTBQ characters and characters of color seem to die an awful lot more than others.\\" TV Guide listed the death as one of the most important television moments of 2016, arguing that while Lexa was not a main character, she \\"was critically important to a portion of the population who watched the show: a strong, proudly LGBT character whose sexuality was only a part of who she was  a rarity on TV.\\", and that her death \\"sparked a year-long discussion about how, and why, this trope must change.\\" Creator and portrayer commentary Rothenberg said he had not always planned on killing Lexa, but the fact that Debnam-Carey was simultaneously on another show (Fear the Walking Dead), and was therefore unlikely to ever become a series regular on The 100, he felt use of the character would be limited or absent in the future. This is when the writers decided to craft a death scene for her to propel the story forward. \\"I remember as we were breaking the season, we talked about reincarnation in the Grounder world and how that was how commanders were selected. I didn't want to throw that out as nonsense, which is how Clarke had received it, but I also didn't want to say that it was real reincarnation,\\" he said, adding he had been reading The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil at the time, which \\"talks quite a bit about a future where we'll be able to upload our minds—literally upload our consciousness—into a computer and live forever.\\" This gave Rothenberg the idea for incorporating a \\"technological reincarnation\\" storyline. \\"The commander A.I. would need to be able to pass itself from person to person over time and [...] Lexa was just the most recent recipient of this artificial intelligence augmentation of her consciousness. So once we came up with that idea, that was the point at which everything jelled and sort of came together storytelling-wise,\\" he stated. \\"And of course, if you're dealing with a story about reincarnation, you've got to die before you can be reincarnated. So Lexa dying became a very tragic necessity.\\" Rothenberg said Clarke was in love with Lexa, that they were soulmates, and Lexa's death will haunt Clarke. \\"[She] is going to have to figure out how to compartmentalize, the way that all of us have to do in the real world when people are suddenly and tragically taken away from us,\\" he added. \\"That's kind of the point of The 100 in many ways. These horrible things happen and yet we still have to figure out a way to move on and be the heroes of our own stories.\\" Debnam-Carey thanked Lexa's creators, and said, \\"It has been an honour to portray [Lexa]. To envelop myself in her skin. To be given the freedom to represent a moment in our cultural and social zeitgeist—she has left a great imprint on me. I will miss her. May we meet again.\\" While at Paleyfest 2016 promoting Fear the Walking Dead, she addressed Lexa's death publicly for the first time. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she said she was \\"surprised by the intensity and the fury\\" that came from fans and she did not think \\"anyone on the show expected such social outcry.\\" To Debnam-Carey, \\"any attention we can draw to a movement like that is an amazing thing, and is a great thing to pursue and keep working towards.\\" She emphasized Lexa's death never came from a place of hate or negativity from the writers or Rothenberg, or anyone in the crew, and the death was purely a creative decision made due to her obligations to Fear the Walking Dead. \\"I know obviously that it's hard when there are social issues going on and maybe they were dealt with in an insensitive way for some people,\\" stated Debnam-Carey. \\"And I hate that people feel like that. That's really awful if people feel ostracized or targeted.\\" At her second Q&A; panel weekend at Copenhagen Comic-Con, she said, \\"It saddens me to think that this was an event that tarnished the show.\\" The fan outcry and discussions over Lexa's death led several screenwriters and producers to sign the Lexa Pledge, promising to treat gay and lesbian characters with consideration of their emotional and cultural impact. Some have argued that this stifles creativity and the freedom to develop characters and stories, while others have welcomed the debate, even if they have not signed the pledge. Although Rothenberg said he was \\"very sorry for not recognizing [the \\"bury your gays\\" trope] as fully as [he] should have\\", he would have still killed off Lexa; he would have written it in a way that does not perpetuate the trope, such as death after sex. He said that while he understands the argument that Lexa should have had a heroic death, having such a powerful character die by a stray bullet was more realistic because it signifies that anyone can be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who wrote the episode, said, \\"I don't think that the failure here was to discuss [Lexa's death], the failure was to recognize the cultural impact it would have outside the show [...] I am grateful for the tidal wave that came down on me. The activism that goes on online is [very] important.\\" References Category:The 100 (TV series) Category:Television characters introduced in 2014 Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Science fiction television characters Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional lesbians ","title":"Lexa (The 100)"},{"id":"49348457","text":"Antelope Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of South Dakota.

He has not been seen by anyone who could positively identify him since 1996, when he went to see a Ford Thunderbird he was interested in purchasing. Myron Wynn, who accompanied him at that time, was convicted 15 years later of murdering Wykel. Wynn maintains that he is innocent and that Wykel went to Argentina. The case was treated as a missing person investigation for years, despite early suspicion centering on Wynn, whom police named as a person of interest shortly afterwards. Prosecutors charged him with the crime in 2009, although they had not found Wykel's body. They relied on his conflicting and evasive statements to police during the initial investigation, and a diamond Wynn gave to his then girlfriend shortly after Wykel's disappearance. Police believed the diamond belonged to Wykel, suggesting robbery as his motive for the murder. After Wynn's first trial in 2010 ended in a hung jury, he was retried, convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The verdict was sustained on appeal. The case has been featured in an episode of the Investigation Discovery series Disappeared. Wykel's body remains undiscovered. Background Wykel, a native of Illinois who had owned restaurants there and in New Mexico, The closed captions from the Disappeared episode. had gone west to work on the Alaska pipeline. His work had also taken him to foreign countries. In the early 1990s, he settled in the Seattle suburb of Burien, where he had had a successful career as a sheet metal worker and was able to take advantage of the area's abundant opportunities for the outdoor recreation activities he enjoyed. His former wife still lived in Illinois, near their daughter and her family, but the two had been talking about reconciling and reuniting. After retiring, he supplemented his pension by buying classic cars at auto auctions, restoring them, and reselling them for a profit. He restored a 1989 Mercedes Benz, which he drove as his own. His other passion, fine jewelry, showed in a ring with a 1.25-carat diamond in a distinctive European cut, which he wore constantly, even when working on cars. He often met with other retirees mornings to socialize over coffee at a White Center McDonald's . In early 1996, the men were joined by Myron Wynn, a younger man who sometimes went by the name of Myron Holdredge or Michael Holdredge. He gravitated toward Wykel, seeking out opportunities to associate with him. At the time Wynn was unemployed, supported by a girlfriend, with whom he lived. Wynn told Wykel that he had learned that a soldier at Fort Lewis, near Tacoma, was offering a mid-1950s Ford Thunderbird for sale. Wykel, who had long been looking for one, gave Wynn a thousand dollars as a deposit on the eventual sale of the car. Bank records show that Wykel also withdrew $5,200 from his account in cash, the way he preferred to pay, to complete the transaction. Wynn put off Wykel repeatedly when the older man pressed him as to when he could get the car. Wykel in turn was growing increasingly frustrated with his putative middleman. At a weekly poker game with friends and neighbors whom he excitedly told about the Thunderbird on previous occasions, Wykel said he was either going to get his money back from Wynn or the car. On February 21, Wykel said he had finally made arrangements to pick up the car the next morning. Disappearance No one who knew Robert Wykel saw or heard from him after that. His initial absence was not unusual, as his trips to get cars sometimes took a few days. John Ogdon, a younger neighbor, who was part of the same weekly poker game, was a little surprised at first that Wykel had not come to his house to show off the car he had been waiting so long to get, as he often did. When Wykel did not attend the next poker game, Ogdon became concerned. He noticed that Wykel's Mercedes was not in his driveway, either. He called 9-1-1 to report Wykel missing, but was told that it was not against the law if Wykel had chosen to disappear. Meanwhile, in Illinois, Wykel's family there was also concerned. He was not returning any phone messages, something he usually did within a short time. Their messages on his answering machine showed their increasing worry. Ogdon kept an eye on Wykel's house, noting that mail piled up. He looked through it over the next couple of weeks for clues that might explain Wykel's absence. On March 13, he found a notice that Wykel's Mercedes, which had apparently been in a nearby park and ride lot, had been impounded. This news disturbed Ogdon. The car's location was not unusual; he knew Wykel customarily took public transportation when he expected to buy a car, so that he could return home in the new purchase. However, the lot was only five blocks from his house, so he usually walked to it. Even if he had driven, he would not have used the Mercedes. Indeed, Wykel would often park the Mercedes in Ogdon's driveway when he left the area . Furthermore, Ogdon read in the impound notice that the car had first been seen at the lot a few days earlier, while Wykel had been gone for three weeks. He believed someone else, familiar with Wykel's habits, might have put the car there. When Ogdon called police with this information, they agreed to open a missing persons investigation. Investigation A detective with the King County Sheriff's Office (KCSO), who responded, entered Wykel's house. In the kitchen, he found dishes in the sink and food, rotting on the countertop, coffee in the pot and an unfinished drink. Wykel's closets were full, and his luggage was in the house, Police concluded that Wykel had not expected to be gone long and intended to return. Police opened the Mercedes and searched for clues. They found no fingerprints, but did find Wykel's empty wallet. After Ogdon informed Rebecca Lee, Wykel's daughter, that her father had been missing for two weeks and police were investigating, she came to the Seattle area to assist in the search. She informed the media, who ran stories about the case. Police were hoping that someone might come forward with information about a botched robbery or accident, but no leads developed. From his daughter, police learned of Wykel's background and theorized that he might have decided to travel abroad. He had taken his children to Argentina, a country he particularly liked, once when he worked there so they could experience another culture. He still had friends there and talked of returning some day. However, his passport was still in the house, the police found no records of travel plans, and his bank account showed no activity since the withdrawal of the $5,200. The only other possibility was the Thunderbird Wykel had been ready to purchase with that money. Ogdon recalled that Wykel had been losing his patience with the person, who had said he could arrange the purchase, but never heard Wykel mention the man's name. Lee learned of her father's breakfasts at the McDonald's and went to visit the men herself. They, too, had noticed and been concerned by Wykel's disappearance. They told her that the younger man, who had told Wykel about the car and that they recalled as Mike, had also not returned to eat with them since the time Wykel disappeared. They found his last name, Wynn, in his signature on a goodbye card the group had given the restaurant's manager, who was about to leave the job. =Focus on Wynn= Before anyone else could find Mike Wynn, he called Lee at her hotel, and told her he had gotten her number from her father's landlady. He said he had only recently returned from a trip out of town and learned about Wykel's disappearance. As far as he knew, he told her, Wykel had gone on an extended trip to an auto auction in California. Police found that unusual, because Wykel had uncharacteristically not told his closest friends about such plans, yet Wynn knew. Eventually detectives were able to talk to Wynn themselves. He told them he had not himself seen Wykel since breakfast on February 20. At first, he claimed that the two had never discussed any cars Wykel was interested in purchasing. When police told him that other men at the breakfasts recalled that they had, he said that the deal they had made did not work out. Wynn became more interesting to police when they investigated his past. They found he had used several aliases and been charged with drug trafficking and violence against women on several occasions. His girlfriend told them that he said he was going to work every day when he left the house, but she knew he never held a job. \\"He [was] basically a con man,\\" one detective later told Disappeared. At Wykel's house, police found messages from Wynn amidst those from his friends and family on the answering machine. Wynn's stood out, because they did not show the increasing concern and worry that Wykel's friends expressed when days passed without return calls. One of Wynn's later messages even implied that Wykel had returned a message. One detective suggested that Wynn take a lie detector test, and he agreed. However, he never came when he said he would, or asked to delay the test. Police found that he was lying about why. In one instance, he claimed to have a dental appointment, but a detective, who watched the dentist's office in question, never saw Wynn enter. Later, the dentist said Wynn was not a patient. They became convinced he was a pathological liar. A review of Wykel's phone records led to the first break in the case. On February 20, the day before he disappeared, Wykel made two calls to Mother Nature's Acres, a RV park with its own woods and trails outside Yelm, in Thurston County, south of Tacoma. Wynn's family owned and operated it. The King County detectives went there and talked to the employees. One of them, Wynn's sister Robyn, recalled that he had come down on February 23. He was with a man who matched Wykel's description, and drove a black Mercedes similar to Wykel's. They claimed they were just killing some time while they waited for a car the other man was trying to purchase became available. Robyn recalled that the man, who appeared to be Wykel, made a telephone call and seemed increasingly impatient. Other employees at the RV park corroborated Robyn's account. If it was Wykel, it was the last time he had been seen. Detectives now believed they had proof that Wynn had lied to them again when he claimed he and Wykel had never seriously pursued the purchase of the Thunderbird, and when he claimed to have last seen Wykel three days earlier. Robyn's account also linked him to Wykel's Mercedes during the time it was unaccounted for. They looked forward to talking to Wynn again and asking him to explain these latest discrepancies in his account. When he was arrested on an outstanding warrant for a traffic violation on April 11, they thought they had their chance. Instead, Wynn invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to tell them anything more until he spoke to a lawyer. After he was released, he left the Seattle area. Detectives had come to believe Wykel had met with foul play, and designated Wynn a person of interest in the case. Since they had no new leads, the case soon grew cold. =The diamond= For the next three years the KCSO detectives worked mostly on other cases, but never quite left the Wykel case behind, staying in touch with the family infrequently. Lee said later she felt they had given up on her father. In 1999, one detective, Jon Holland, took over the case and took a more aggressive approach, putting up flyers in the area that made clear the police thought Wykel had come to harm. He and Susan Peters, a detective who had been part of the original investigation and had kept in touch with Lee, decided to go talk to Robyn Wynn again. She told them two things that interested them. First, she said she had seen her brother within the last two years, at a family reunion in Texas; this was the first time the King County authorities knew his whereabouts since his original departure. Second, he had been showing off a large diamond set in a pendant, something that seemed unusual to her, since he was so often unemployed and could not likely afford such a stone. Peters and Holland wondered if this could be Wykel's diamond. In 2000, they interviewed the woman Wynn had been living with, four years earlier, but now no longer in a relationship with him. She said that in late February 1996, shortly after Wykel disappeared, Wynn gave her a diamond pendant as a birthday gift. It was not in a box such as a jeweler might use to package it. She suspected it was not real due to its large size, and had no idea where it might have come from. He told her he'd found it at the Burien park and ride lot, coincidentally the same place Wykel's abandoned Mercedes had been parked. However, he had taken it back from her when the relationship ended and she made him leave her house. Robyn later told them that her brother sold the diamond pendant to an aunt for $2,000. She helped the King County detectives contact the woman. At first, the aunt said that he had offered it to her for $1,500, claiming to have bought it from a coworker for a thousand dollars more. A jeweler she took it to appraised it at $3–5,000. She claimed at first to have still not bought it and merely let Wynn live with her, but then admitted she had eventually bought it from Wynn for $2,000. She still had it and they persuaded her to give it to them for examination. A gemologist who examined it told them that it indeed had the unusual European cut it had been described as having by Rebecca Lee. He also found many nicks and scrapes on it, consistent with doing metalwork while wearing it in a ring. Later, Rebecca went to another jeweler who specialized in recreating lost pieces from detailed descriptions given to him. He made a drawing based on her description of her father's ring. It matched the stone the police got from Wynn's aunt, and thus from Wynn himself, almost exactly—even the stone's diameter was the same. Holland and Peters called Wynn in Texas and asked about his sister's account that he and Wykel had been seen together two days after Wynn claimed to have last seen the older man. He admitted to going to Thurston County with Wykel, where he said they tried to call the seller. Afterwards, Wynn said, they drove back to Burien but he could not remember where Wykel dropped him off. The detectives bluffed and told him they had security camera footage showing the car going into the park and ride. The next interview took place in Texas. This time they told him about the diamond. He confirmed that he found it in the Burien park and ride, the same lot where Wykel's Mercedes had been abandoned. This answer again interested the detectives, as Wynn had never suggested he had been there before. When bluffed again and told him that they found Wykel's DNA on the diamond, Wynn changed his story again, explaining that he had shown it to Wykel immediately after finding it, another detail that he had not shared during the initial investigation. The detectives felt they had enough circumstantial evidence to charge Wynn with Wykel's murder. They still did not have a body, and prosecutors were uncertain they could convict Wynn without finding Wykel's body. They decided to try to find the body, searching a number of places in and around Thurston County where Wynn could have disposed of a body. They were unsuccessful. In the meantime, Wykel's family had him declared legally dead in 2003, seven years after he had last been seen. Arrest The case again stalled, but Holland and Peters kept working it when they could. Without Wykel's body, they knew that prosecutors would have to show a strong motive and detailed sequence of events. They continued to travel to Texas and talk to Wynn whenever they uncovered something. Each time another contradiction in his account was pointed out to him, Wynn changed his story again. \\"We wrote every single lie down,\\" Peters recalled later, \\"and we have pages of inconsistencies.\\" On one of those visits they asked, again, if he would take a lie detector test. He told them that his attorney had advised him not to. When the detectives asked him for the name of his attorney, he asked \\"Does it matter?\\" The break that finally gave the detectives the evidence they needed to arrest Wynn came from Texas. A friend of Wynn, with whom he had apparently discussed the case, told them Wynn said that \\"nothing's gonna happen. They're not even looking in the right ballpark for the body,\\" suggesting to Holland and Peters that not only did Wynn know there was a body, but where it was. In 2009, authorities in Texas arrested Wynn and extradited him to Washington to stand trial on a charge of first- degree murder. Trials Without Wykel's body, prosecutors knew they would have to present a lot more evidence than they might otherwise to support their case that Wynn killed Wykel. They theorized that Wynn had overheard Wykel talking about cars, and seen him showing his cash, at McDonald's one morning, and decided he would make a good mark for another confidence scheme. To support this theory they put on four witnesses who previously had been Wynn's victims in similar schemes. In those cases, Wynn asked a portion of the price for something greatly desired by them, and claimed he was able to help them purchase, but never completed the deals. The lengthy record of his prevarications and evasions to the police supported this claim about his duplicitous tendencies, and linked him to the crime. Wykel, however, was the first such \\"mark\\" to begin to realize that he was being defrauded. To avoid returning the thousand dollars, prosecutors claimed, Wynn played for time by taking Wykel down to Thurston County on the pretext of meeting the seller. Once there, he lured Wykel to an isolated location alone, where he either inadvertently killed Wykel during a confrontation over the money or deliberately killed him, with the added bonus of the cash Wykel had on him and his diamond ring. Under this theory, Wynn's overriding purpose was robbery, a predicate felony justifying the most serious murder charge available under Washington law. The prosecutors dropped the initial charge of premeditation as well. Wynn went on trial in mid-2010. He continued to profess his innocence. In addition to the missing body and the lack of any evidence suggesting Wykel was dead, Wynn argued that the police had not adequately explored the possibility they originally entertained that the older man might have suddenly decided to visit Argentina. The court declared a mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. A few months later in early 2011, a new jury was impaneled and Wynn was tried again. During the trial, there were allegations of juror misconduct. One alternate juror had \\"kept bumping into\\" both prosecutors and defense lawyers, and had at one point been caught looking at state evidence in the elevator. Two others, the bailiff said, had begun deliberating before the case was submitted. Superior Court Judge Susan Craighead dismissed them both and seated two alternates, one of whom was the juror alleged to have attempted to look at the prosecution evidence. That jury convicted Wynn in April, after a day's deliberations. After the verdict, his lawyers asked for a post-trial hearing on whether the juror misconduct had been prejudicial to the outcome; Craighead ruled that it had not been. At sentencing, Wynn continued to insist on his innocence. \\"I'm not going to beg forgiveness for something I did not do,\\" he told Craighead. She sentenced him to 20 years, the minimum for first-degree murder in Washington. he is serving his time at Clallam Bay Corrections Center. Appeal Wynn appealed his conviction to the Washington Court of Appeals, Division I. He did not challenge the murder conviction itself. Instead, he claimed there had been insufficient evidence to suggest the robbery was related to the murder, therefore negating the first-degree murder charge. He argued that the murder was not necessary for him to steal the money since that had happened well in advance, nor was it related to the theft of the ring since under the state's case he had not demonstrated any intent to steal the ring prior to the murder. At most, he argued, the state had proved that he had taken the ring as an \\"afterthought\\" to the murder. He also challenged a jury instruction—\\"The taking constitutes robbery, even if death precedes the taking, whenever the taking and a homicide are part of the same transaction\\"—that he said reflected this same misunderstanding. In addition, he raised two procedural issues. First, Judge Craighead had ruled incorrectly at the post-trial hearing on the juror misconduct. Second, his lawyers at trial should have allowed him to take the stand in his own defense, which he claimed they argued about regularly. In June 2013, a panel of three judges unanimously upheld Wynn's conviction. Judge Mary Kay Becker wrote for herself, Linda Lau and Anna Schindler that a jury could have reasonably concluded from the evidence presented, interpreted in the light most favorable to the state, that Wynn killed Wykel at least in part to keep the money he had already obtained fraudulently. As for the ring and any cash Wykel had, the jury had had the option to convict him merely of theft, since taking property from a deceased person is not by itself robbery. But the jury had found Wynn committed robbery, by virtue of its conviction on the first-degree felony murder charge. If it did so on the basis of Wynn's actions after killing Wykel, Becker wrote, it could have taken note that he had no legitimate regular employment at that time. It would have been perfectly reasonable for the jury to have concluded that Wynn needed money and killed Wykel for the cash and the diamond ring, and that taking these items after Wykel's death constituted robbery. Nothing in the record, Becker said, suggested to the panel that there was any abuse of discretion by Craighead in her handling of the juror misconduct issue. Nor did Wynn offer any new insight or evidence that would have afforded an opportunity for further review. As for Wynn's desire to testify on his own behalf, his briefs did not elaborate on what he might have said or how his testimony could have changed the outcome. Nor did he suggest that his attorneys' refusal to do so constituted either ineffective assistance of counsel or misconduct.

It was built from 1877 to 1954. It is also known as Cairns General Cemetery and Cairns Pioneer Cemetery. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Cairns was established officially in October 1876, as a port for the newly discovered Hodgkinson goldfields. When the town was surveyed in late 1876, no provision was made for a public cemetery. Earliest burials took place along the Esplanade to the north of the town centre, near the hospital reserve. On 15 September 1877, almost a year after the establishment of Cairns, a 5-acre site bounded on three sides by McLeod, Gatton and Grove Streets (Section 36, County of Cook, Town of Cairns), was gazetted as a permanent cemetery reserve. The following month, an adjacent five acres (Section 35, bounded on three sides by McLeod, Gatton and Upward Streets) also were gazetted as permanent cemetery reserve. The site was chosen because it was thought to be on dry ground, was sufficiently far from the inhabited section of the town, and was accessible from the hospital reserve. Only subsequently was it discovered that the site was poorly drained and subject to seasonal flooding, with graves unable to be dug to a greater depth than . Trustees were appointed in December 1877, but the cemetery reserves in McLeod Street appear to have been unregulated and little used until the mid-1880s. New trustees had been appointed in 1879, but by mid-1883 the cemetery was without supervision or management and no register of burials was being kept. There was no road to the site (McLeod Street was unmade beyond Spence Street in 1884), and the land was not cleared. New trustees were appointed in September 1883, and in mid-1884 they applied to the Queensland colonial government for financial assistance to establish the Cairns General Cemetery, and to have regulations for the administration of the cemetery approved. A loan of was granted, and regulations for the administration of the cemetery were gazetted on 5 July 1884. In August 1884, the trustees called tenders for fencing the Cairns General Cemetery, and in February 1885, tenders for clearing the site and also fencing the burial ground on the Esplanade. A sexton had been appointed by February 1885, and in the same month the trustees submitted to the colonial secretary their first return of receipts and expenses, year ending 31 December 1884. Initially, only half of Section 36 and none of Section 35 was fenced as a burial ground. The cemetery appears to have been divided into sections for the use of various Christian denominations, and an area for non-Christians, in which were buried Chinese, Malays, Javanese, and Aborigines. Hebrews may have had a separate section. The Chinese in particular had contributed significantly to the economic and cultural development of Cairns in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and are believed to have celebrated the feast of the dead three times each year at the cemetery. By the end of the 19th century the cemetery had become unkempt, and was cause for local comment. Consequently, in 1900 the trustees sought permission to increase the burial fees to defray the expense of ground improvements. A new sexton, William Parsons, was appointed, and by his efforts the principal pathway was metalled and bordered with variegated hedging plants and crotons, flowering shrubs and trees were planted along the fence fronting McLeod Street, the graves were cleared of weed and spear grass, and couch grass imported from the south was laid. In 1914 a new fence and two gates were erected, but these are no longer extant. Whether this fence enclosed the whole of Section 36 is not clear. On 22 December 1916 a new cemetery in Martyn Street was opened, following which, burials in the McLeod Street cemetery were restricted to those in family plots. The last burial took place in 1949, and the cemetery was closed officially on 11 May 1954. Registers of burials in the cemetery exist only for the period 1887-1919, and a Register of Deaths for the period 1887-1949, but these indicate that between 1887 and 1949 there were approximately 2500 burials in the McLeod Street cemetery. The main reason why the unsuitable site remained in use as Cairns' principal cemetery for at least 30 years, was the difficulty experienced in selecting a new location. As early as 1885, the trustees began to investigate alternative sites for a cemetery, and in May 1886, the colonial government, acting on the trustees' application, reserved for cemetery purposes a 40-acre site nearly four miles from town. In the process the McLeod Street cemetery reserves created in September and October 1877 were cancelled. The trustees immediately pointed out that half of Section 36, (allotments 1-5 and 16-20), was fenced and in use as a cemetery, and should be re- gazetted. Due to some confusion by the Lands Department, Section 36 was not re-proclaimed a cemetery reserve (R274) until June 1923. No burials had taken place in Section 35, and in 1908/09 it was divided into reserves for a morgue, endemic diseases hospital, and municipal purposes. It is now a reserve for electricity purposes. The 1886 cemetery reserve proved too difficult to access, and was cancelled in 1890 when a new cemetery of was reserved from the former police paddock near Stratford. Although increased to over in 1891, and located adjacent to the Cairns-Herberton railway, it was never used as a cemetery. In 1928 part of the reserve was resumed and subdivided into residential allotments for workers' housing, and the remaining reserve was cancelled in 1940. In the meantime, the cemetery reserve in Martyn Street had been proclaimed and opened for use in late 1916. The number of burials at the McLeod Street cemetery increased substantially after the turn of the century, and in August 1905 the Cairns Town Council, under the provisions of the Local Government Act of 1902, assumed trusteeship of the Cairns General Cemetery. Technically, this trusteeship referred to the 1890 cemetery reserve near Stratford, but the Cairns Town Council interpreted it as giving them control of the McLeod Street cemetery. This control was not made official until 1923. The Cairns City Council failed in 1965, 1968/69, 1973/74 and 1986, to gain permission from the Lands Department to convert the McLeod Street cemetery into a park. Finally, in 1988, the Council commissioned a conservation plan for the old cemetery. This was adopted and the Council, together with local organisations and volunteers, restored the remaining graves (approximately 290), identified over 200 previously \\"lost\\" grave sites, removed self-sown mature trees which were causing damage to graves, rebuilt the fence facing the railway line, lit the principal pathway, and built a small information centre within the grounds. The site was renamed the McLeod Street Pioneer Cemetery, and is promoted in Cairns as a tourist attraction. Headstone of Richard Ash Kingsford Burials at the McLeod Street cemetery included the first mayor of Cairns, Richard Ash Kingsford; Cairns' much admired medical pioneer, Dr Edward Albert Koch; men who died during construction of the Cairns to Herberton Railway; and a beche-de-mere fisherman who had been associated with Trinity Bay prior to the establishment of Cairns. The surviving headstones record people from all levels of early Cairns society - professional, business, clerical, political, mercantile - and the cosmopolitan nature of early Cairns is reflected in the range of nationalities, including English, Irish, Scottish, Japanese, Javanese, Chinese, Indian, Italian, Bulgarian and Swedish, buried in the McLeod Street cemetery.  Description  The Pioneer Cemetery, located on a level site on the southern corner of McLeod and Grove Streets, is bounded by the Cairns railway to the southwest and industrial buildings to the southeast. The cemetery is well maintained, with many of the trees which had caused structural damage to graves having been removed, and an extensive landscape program undertaken. A rotunda has been recently constructed in the centre of the cemetery to display interpretive material. Paths bounded by colourful native plants, leading northeast to McLeod Street and west to Grove Street, have been laid to replicate those existing in 1901. There is a large group of pine trees to the northwest, which will eventually be removed as the acid from the pine needles damages marble. The cemetery contains denominational divisions, the boundaries of which are not clear, including Protestant, Roman Catholic, mixed denominations and non-Christian. Although the cemetery contains over 2500 graves, many of these are yet to be located. Sub-surface graves, identified with the use of a metal detector locating grave number markers, have each been marked with a small concrete plinth. The plinths incorporate brass plaques inscribed with the name of the deceased, year and place of birth, year of death, last place of residence and occupation, if known. Of these, approximately 200 have been positively identified and a further 100 have been located but lack enough information for positive identification. As possibly only 600-700 graves can be accurately located, the names of all those interred are intended to be placed in the recent rotunda structure. Many of the graves have concrete surrounds with marble headstones. Some graves retain iron railing surrounds, some of which have collapsed or are partially missing. There are a few large monumental graves, featuring carved granite and marble head-pieces. A timber paling fence has been constructed along the southwest boundary, with pine log barriers along both street frontages.  Notable interments  *Grave of Dr Edward Albert KochRichard Ash Kingsford, mayor of Brisbane and Cairns and Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * Edward Albert Koch, doctor in Cairns  Heritage listing  McLeod Street Pioneer Cemetery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The McLeod Street Pioneer Cemetery survives as a unique historical record of the multi-cultural social, economic and political life of early Cairns, and is an unusual illustration of the major events which shaped the development of Cairns and Far North Queensland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. In the formal arrangement of grave sites, denominational divisions and types of memorials, the cemetery reflects late 19th and early 20th century public taste and social perceptions about burial and memorial. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place has aesthetic value, which contributes to the Cairns townscape.

In the 2016 census, Cairns North had a population of 5,191 people.  Geography  Cairns North is bounded by the Cairns Airport to the north, the Coral Sea to the east and Lily Creek to the west. As the name suggests, it is immediately north of the Cairns central business district. Highway 1 (part of the main route around the Australian coast) passes through the suburb on Sheridan Street. The suburb is flat land just above sea level. Parkland and an esplanade separate the developed areas of the suburb from the sea. At high tide there is a small sandy beach but low tide reveals an extensive mudflat. The suburb has a mix of uses having both permanent and holiday residential (the latter being mostly close to the shore), commercial buildings and community facilities, including a number of schools, Cairns Hospital, the Tobruk Memorial swimming pool and the now closed cemetery in McLeod Street.  History  Edge Hill State School opened in Cairns North on 19 February 1917. It was renamed Cairns North State School in 1939 ( just prior to the opening of a separate Edge Hill State School in neighbouring suburb of Edge Hill in 1940). Cairns North State School closed on 31 December 2004. Cairns State High School opened on 28 January 1924, having commenced operation as an annex to Cairns Central State School in 1917. Mother of Good Counsel School opened on 29 March 1936 with 19 students, after Father Phelan (an Augustinian priest) saw the need for Catholic education in the area. The school was operated by the Sisters of Mercy. Although Cairns North has a beach, in 1962 concerns about marine stingers in the seawater resulted in the establishment of the Tobruk Memorial swimming pool (not to be confused with the similarly named pool in Townsville).

Geography Greatfield estate is located in the far south-east of Kingston upon Hull, close to the eastern boundary of the city, formed by the Old Fleet Drain. To the south it is bounded by the former Hull and Holderness Railway (now a cycle track), beyond which is a portside industrial area, and the King George Dock; to the west is Craven Park rugby ground, and the Preston Road Estate beyond; to the north-west is the Bilton Grange estate; and to the east is open farmland in the East Riding of Yorkshire – Preston is around to the east. The estate is lowlying, under above sea level. Annandale Road is the main road of the estate which bends, coming from the north-west and exiting to the west, connecting with Preston Road.Ordnance Survey 1:25000 2006; OS OpenData 2016 In 2007 the area was classed as an economically deprived area, with many residents in lower socioeconomic classes – people in the estate are predominately white British ethnically, with 93.1% classed as white. History Before the construction of the estate the land at 'Greatfield' was undeveloped -in 1850 it was enclosed drained fields with no roads – this situation continued until the estate's construction. The Hull and Holderness Railway which later bounded the estate to the south was constructed in the early 1850s. The Preston Road estate immediately to the west was under development by the 1930s, and the nearby Eastern Cemetery came into use in 1931.Ordnance Survey Sheet 227, 227SW 1852, 1908, 1925–8, 1938, 1947 In the reconstruction period after the Second World War the Hull Corporation created several new housing estates in east Hull – these were Bilton Grange, Longhill and the Greatfield Estate. All were designed by Andrew Rankine, Hull's city architect as independent units, each with its own shops, schools, libraries and other civic facilities. Their design was in a reduced Festival of Britain style, with pantile roofed brick buildings, built along generally short curving roads with generous common open treed areas. Greatfield estate consisted of 823 houses. Initially designed to create a near classless social structure, with a village or small town social structure, the estate was completed in 1960. The Anglican church of St Hilda was opened 1960, a subsidiary of the parish of Marfleet. A dedicated library for the estate was opened in 1963. The Roman Catholic St Stephen's church opened in 1966. Other facilities around the estate in 1961 were numerous schools to cater for the post war baby boom. Primary level education was catered for by Ashwell Infants School and Ashwell Junior School (both off Ashwell Avenue), Oldfleet Infants School (off Bradford Avenue), and Stockwell Infants School (off Dodswell Grove). Changes in the City's educational framework in 1969 saw the two Ashwell Schools sharing the same site becoming a Junior High School (intake ages 9 -13). Changes to demographics in the 1990–2000 period across the east of the city saw Ashwell JHS closed and was demolished in 2009, with the two remaining Infant Schools (Stockwell and Oldfleet) becoming County Primary Schools (intake ages 5 – 13). Greatfield Senior High School was established in 1957 on a tripartite educational system – it consisted of three halls: Newton Hall, a Grammar school (600 places, intake ages 11–16); Elizabethan Hall, a secondary modern (450 places, intake 11–16); and Shakespeare Hall, a Technical school (450 places). The original three schools were located adjacent to each other to the west of Greatfield Estate, located south of Preston Road and east of Poorhouse Lane.Ordnance Survey 1:10000 1971 In 1969 the 11-plus was abandoned across the City and Newton and Elizabethan Hall merged into a Senior High school (intake ages 13–16), whilst Shakespeare became a new Junior High School (intake ages 9 -13). Local demographic changes saw the Shakespeare JHS closed in 1988 and soon after demolished, and a new discount supermarket (KwikSave) being build on the former school building site. The new (and current) Craven Park rugby ground was built on the school playing fields to the south of the former Shakespeare JHS site along Poorhouse Lane in the late 1980s, following the rugby club selling off its former ground on Holderness Road to the Co-operative supermarket chain. The Greatfield Senior High School (Newton Hall and Elizabethan Hall) were themselves demolished in early 2010's, although the new gym building was retained as a community facility. In 2014 construction began of a new special alternative provision academy school, \\"Aspire Academy\\", on the site of the Isaac Newton school. The school opened 2015.Sources:  * The estate was served by three public houses, all Hull Brewery tied houses, The Lord Charles, on Annandale Road to the rear of the shopping parade, The Falcon, midway along Falkland Road, and The Goat and Compasses, at the southern end of Falkland Road before the railway line and footbridge Ordnance Survey 1961 1:2500 to Somerden Road and Hedon Road beyond.

Moses-Scatliffe is divorced with one child. Moses-Scatliffe was named as a potential candidate for the National Democratic Party for the anticipated British Virgin Islands general election, 2019. A number of public figures, the most prominent being Deputy Premier Kedrick Pickering, expressed concern at Moses-Scatliffe being held out as a candidate for a political party whilst occupying the position of Speaker of the House. Ms Moses-Scatliffe refused to confirm or deny that she would be a candidate for the NDP, and the Attorney General rendered an opinion indicating that even if she were, this would not legally preclude her from acting as Speaker of the House in the interim.

Lining could also be used to lower steamboats through otherwise impassible falls. Technique Lining involved running a rope, called a line or a steel cable to a secure point on shore, typically a large tree or a bolt specially set in a rock, and then wrapping the cable around a steam-powered winch on the boat. The winch would then crank in the cable, if the vessel was going upstream, or gradually let out the cable, if the vessel was headed downstream. Use on the Willamette River Along the Willamette River, in the first decades of the 1900s, the most dangerous obstacles to navigation were Willamette Falls and the Clackamas Rapids. Since 1873 locks at Oregon allowed navigation around Willamette Falls, but as late as 1907, lining was still required to pass the Clackamas Rapids, which were located north of Oregon City, near the mouth of the Clackamas River. Hazards Lining was dangerous, as it was only the single cable that prevented the vessel from being washed downstream and likely wrecked. Any use of a cable on board a vessel was also hazardous to the crew. On October 15, 1907, at 8:30 am, while Oregona was lining through Clackamas Rapids, the lining cable became tangled in the sternwheel of a nearby steamer, the Ruth. A deckhand on Oregona, Virgil K. Pollard, was caught in a loop of the cable, which tightened around his legs, severing both legs six inches (15 cm) above the ankles. The injured deckhand brought a legal action against the Ruth. When the case was presented to U.S. District Court Judge Robert S. Bean, he ruled that accident was held to be the fault of the Ruth, for ignoring the warning signals of the Oregona to stand away while the deckhand was engaged in coiling the cable which was still paid out from the Oregona following an unsuccessful lining attempt. Judge Bean awarded the deckhand, who was 19 years of age at the time of the accident, $12,000 in damages.The Ruth, 178 Fed. Rptr. 749 (District Ct. of Oregon 1910). (accessed 07-11-11).

He is mainly known as a still-life painter but he may also have painted religious subjects.Franco Moro. \\"Tintore, Simone del.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 31 May 2016 Life Simone del Tintore was born in Lucca on 7 May 1630. Still life with mushrooms, fruit, a basket of flowers and a cat He trained at the 'Academy of Painting and Drawing of Lucca', which had been established by the local artist Pietro Paolini. Paolini had trained in Rome where he had become closely linked to the followers of Caravaggio. The Academy contributed to a particularly lively artistic environment in Lucca in the second half of the 17th century. Simone del Tintore and his brothers Francesco and Cassiano, as well as numerous other artists such as Girolamo Scaglia, Antonio Franchi, Giovanni Coli and Filippo Gherardi all trained at the Academy.Elisabetta Giffi, PAOLINI, Pietro at Dizionario Biografico Simone del Tintore died in his native Lucca on 16 February 1708. Work Still life with pears, apples, chrysanthemum and other flowers in a basket beside two large lemons The works of Simone del Tintore were only first rediscovered in the 1960s. Simone del Tintore's body of work is often difficult to distinguish from that of Tommaso Salini (1575-1625). Salini was active in an earlier generation. Del Tintore's work has also been confused with that of the Master of the Acquavella Still Life. A small group of still lifes has been attributed to del Tintore based on a shared sense of Baroque dynamism and their disordered yet harmonious compositions. The rediscovery and attribution of the artist's oeuvre is based on the Still life with mushrooms and cabbage (Florence, Gregori Collection) which is inscribed on the reverse with \\"Simone del Tintore\\". The close similarities between his style and that of Bernardo Strozzi is thought to be due to Paolini's influence, who may well have met Strozzi in Rome.Simone del Tintore, Still Life with Pears, Apples, Chrysanthemum and other Flowers in a Basket Beside Two Large Lemons at Sotheby's Still life with mushrooms and flowers Del Tintore evolved from still lifes ('natura morta') to 'natura viva', compositions which included living animals and figures, occasionally painted by his teacher Pietro Paolini. Paolini's Caravaggesque naturalism is also recognizable in Simone del Tintore's work.Simone del Tintore, ‘’ Still Life with a Basket of Fruit, a Bottle, Figs and Mushrooms on a Stone Surface - Still Life with a Vase, Chestnut Branches, Fruit, Flowers and Mushrooms on a Stone Surface’’ at Galerie Canesso Simone del Tintore not only collaborated with Paolini on a number of compositions but also with his brother Francesco del Tintore.Pietro Paolini, A young lady holding a compass at Sotheby's Del Tintore's favoured motifs were wicker baskets laden with fruit and mushrooms scattered about with pale, luminous green leaves transformed into a dense, dark green thanks to the use of chiaroscuro effects. It is clear that Simone del Tintore was much appreciated by his contemporaries as a still-life painter since works by him featuring fruit, funghi, flowers and other objects are recorded in inventories and other documents from the period.Simone del Tintore (Attr.), Still Life with Mushrooms, Fruit, a Basket of Flowers and a Cat on Sotheby's References External links * Category:1630 births Category:1708 deaths Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Lucchese painters Category:People from Lucca Category:Italian still life painters ","title":"Simone del Tintore"},{"id":"49348711","text":"Okondja Airport is an airport serving Okondja in Haut-Ogooué Province, Gabon.

John F. Solomon is an American journalist, conspiracy theorist media executive, and a conservative political commentator. He was an editorialist and executive vice president of digital video for The Hill and as of October 2019, is a contributor to Fox News. He was formerly an executive and editor-in-chief at The Washington Times. While he won a number of awards (including the 2008 Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award) for his investigative journalism, he has in recent years been accused of magnifying small scandals and creating fake controversy. During the Presidency of Donald Trump he has been advancing Trump-friendly stories, and played an important role in advancing conspiracy theories about wrongdoing involving Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and Ukraine; Solomon's stories about the Bidens influenced Trump to request that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky launch an investigation into the elder Biden, which led to an impeachment inquiry. Career  Solomon graduated from Marquette University with a bachelor's degree in journalism and sociology. From May 1987 to December 2006, Solomon worked at the Associated Press, where he became the assistant bureau chief in Washington, helping to develop some of the organization's first digital products, such as its online elections offering. In 2007, he served as The Washington Post's national investigative correspondent. = The Washington Times =  Executive Editor  In February 2008, Solomon became editor-in-chief of The Washington Times. Under Solomon, the Times changed some of its style guide to conform to more mainstream media usage. The Times announced that it would no longer use words like \\"illegal aliens\\" and \\"homosexual,\\" and instead opt for \\"more neutral terminology\\" such as \\"illegal immigrants\\" and \\"gay,\\" respectively. The paper also decided to stop using \\"Hillary\\" when referring to Senator Hillary Clinton, and to stop putting the word \\"marriage\\" in the expression \\"gay marriage\\" in quotes. He also oversaw the redesign of the paper's website and the launch of the paper's national weekly edition. A new television studio was built in the paper’s Washington DC headquarters, and the paper also launched a syndicated three-hour morning drive radio news program. Solomon left the paper in November 2009 after internal shakeups and financial uncertainty among the paper's ownership.  Return  After a three-and-a-half-year hiatus, most of which was spent at Circa News, Solomon returned to the paper in July 2013 to oversee the newspaper's content, digital and business strategies. He helped to craft digital strategies to expand online traffic, created new products and partnerships, and led a reorganization of the company's advertising and sales team. He also helped launch a new subscription-only national edition targeted for tablets, cellphones and other mobile devices, and helped push a redesign of the paper's website. Solomon left the paper in December 2015 to serve as chief creative officer of the mobile news application Circa, which was relaunching at that time. =Packard Media Group= Solomon was president of Packard Media Group from November 2009 to December 2015. Solomon also served as journalist in residence at the Center for Public Integrity, a non-profit organization that specializes in investigative journalism, from March 2010 to June 2011. He was also named executive editor of the Center for Public Integrity in November 2010 and helped oversee the launch of iWatch News, but resigned a few months later to join Newsweek/The Daily Beast in May 2011. =Washington Guardian= In 2012, Solomon and former Associated Press executives Jim Williams and Brad Kalbfeld created the Washington Guardian, an online investigative news portal. It was acquired by The Washington Times when Solomon returned to the paper in July 2013. = Circa = After leaving The Washington Times, Solomon became chief creative officer for Circa News. Circa is a mobile news application founded in 2011 that streams updates on big news events to users. In June 2015, it shut down, but its relaunch was announced after its acquisition by Sinclair Broadcast Group. As chief of Circa, he wrote and published a number of political articles, often defending the Trump administration and former U.S. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty in February 2017 to making false statements to the FBI. He left in July 2017. = The Hill = Upon leaving Circa, Solomon became executive vice president of digital video for The Hill. Until May 2018, he worked on news and investigative pieces for The Hill. According to the New York Times, Solomon tended to push narratives about alleged misdeeds by Trump's political enemies. In October 2017, Solomon published an article in The Hill about the Uranium One controversy where he insinuated that Russia made payments to the Clinton Foundation at the time when the Obama administration approved the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom. Solomon's story also focused on the alleged failures of the Department of Justice to investigate and report on the controversy, suggesting a cover-up. Subsequent to Solomon's reporting, the story \\"took off like wildfire in the right-wing media ecosystem,\\" according to a 2018 study by scholars at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, Harvard University. No evidence of any quid pro quo or other wrongdoing has surfaced. In January 2018, it was reported that newsroom staffers at The Hill had complained about Solomon's reporting for the publication. The staffers reportedly criticized Solomon's reporting as having a conservative bias and missing important context, and that this undermined The Hill's reputation. They also expressed concerns over Solomon's close relationship with conservative Fox News personality Sean Hannity, on whose TV show Hannity he appeared on more than a dozen times over a span of three months. In May 2018, the editor-in-chief of The Hill announced that Solomon would become an \\"opinion contributor\\" at The Hill while remaining executive vice president of digital video. He frequently appeared on Fox News, which continued to describe him as an investigative reporter, even after he became an opinion contributor.  Pro-Donald Trump opinion pieces  Solomon published a story alleging that women who had accused Trump of sexual assault had sought payments from partisan donors and tabloids. On June 19, 2019, The Hill published an opinion piece written by Solomon alleging that the FBI and Robert Mueller disregarded warnings that evidence used against Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort may have been faked. His source was Nazar Kholodnytsky, a disgraced Ukrainian prosecutor, and Konstantin Kilimnik, who has been linked to Russian intelligence and who happens to be Manafort's former business partner.  Solomon's part in the Trump–Ukraine scandal  In April 2019, The Hill published two opinion pieces by Solomon regarding allegations by Ukrainian officials that \\"American Democrats\\" and particularly former Vice-President Joe Biden of collaborating with \\"their allies in Kiev\\" in \\"wrongdoing...ranging from 2016 election interference to obstructing criminal probes.\\" Solomon's stories attracted attention in conservative media. Fox News frequently covered Solomon's claims; Solomon also promoted these allegations on Sean Hannity's Fox News show. According to The Washington Post Solomon's pieces \\"played an important role in advancing a flawed, Trump-friendly tale of corruption in Ukraine, particularly involving Biden and his son Hunter\\", and inspired \\"the alleged effort by Trump and his allies to pressure Ukraine’s government into digging up dirt on Trump’s Democratic rivals.\\" On the same day that The Washington Post published its article, The Hill published another opinion piece by Solomon in which Solomon states that there are \\"(h)undreds of pages of never-released memos and documents...(that) conflict with Biden’s narrative.\\" Solomon's stories had significant flaws. Not only had the State Department dismissed the allegations presented by Solomon as \\"an outright fabrication\\", but the Ukrainian prosecutor who Solomon claimed made the allegations to him is not supporting Solomon's claim. Foreign Policy noted that anti-corrupton activists in Ukraine had characterized the source behind Solomon's claims as an unreliable narrator who had hindered anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. Solomon pushed allegations that Biden wanted to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to prevent an investigation of Burisma, a Ukrainian company that his son, Hunter Biden, served on; however, Western governments and anti-corruption activist wanted the prosecutor removed because he was reluctant to pursue corruption investigations. By September 2019, Solomon said he still stood 100% by his stories. There is no evidence of wrong-doing by Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, and no evidence that Hunter Biden was ever under investigation by Ukrainian authorities. WNYC characterized Solomon's Ukraine stories as laundering of foreign propaganda. Prior to the publication of a story where Solomon alleged that the Obama administration had pressured the Ukrainian government to stop investigating a group funded by George Soros, Solomon sent the full text of his report to Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas and the two pro-Trump lawyers and conspiracy theorists Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing. Solomon said he did so for fact- checking, but Parnas, DiGenova and Toensing were not mentioned in the text, nor did Solomon send individual items of the draft for vetting (but rather the whole draft). During October 2019 hearings for the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, two government officials experienced in Ukraine matters — Alexander Vindman and George Kent — testified that Ukraine-related articles Solomon had written and that were featured in conservative media circles contained a \\"false narrative\\" and in some cases were \\"entirely made up in full cloth.\\" Solomon worked closely with Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudy Giuliani - Trump’s personal attorney – who was indicted for funneling foreign money into American political campaigns, to promote stories that Democrats colluded with a foreign power in the 2016 election (the U.S. intelligence community's assessment is that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to aid Trump, then a Republican presidential candidate). Parnas worked with Solomon on interviews and translation. Solomon defended his work with Parnas: \\"No one knew there was anything wrong with Lev Parnas at the time. Everybody who approaches me has an angle.\\" Parnas helped to set Solomon up with the Ukrainian prosecutor who accused the Bidens of wrong-doing (before later retracting the claim). Solomon and the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump Solomon has been mentioned in a draft report by the House Intelligence Committee published Dec. 3, 2019, documenting President Trump's alleged abuse of office for his personal and political gain by using congressionally approved military aid to induce Ukraine initiate investigations against Trump's domestic political rival. The report documented phone records showing Solomon was in frequent contact with Lev Parnas, a now indicted associate of Giuliani, exchanging \\"at least 10 calls\\" during the first week in April.The Wall Street Journal, \\"Report Reveals Call Records Between Giuliani, White House and Nunes\\" Dec 3, 2019  Advertising controversy  Solomon was accused of breaking the traditional ethical \\"wall\\" that separated news stories from advertising at The Hill. In October 2017, Solomon negotiated a $160,000 deal with a conservative group called Job Creators Network to target ads in The Hill to business owners in Maine. He then had a quote from the group's director inserted into a news story about a Maine senator's key role in an upcoming vote on the Trump administration's tax bill. Solomon “pops by the advertising bullpen almost daily to discuss big deals he’s about to close,\\" Johanna Derlega, then The Hill’s publisher, wrote in an internal memo at the time, according to Pro Publica. \\"If a media reporter gets ahold of this story, it could destroy us.\\"  Departure  In September 2019, the Washington Examiner reported that Solomon would leave The Hill at the end of the month to start his own media firm. A February 2020 internal review by The Hill concluded that there were multiple flaws in Solomon's 14 columns about Ukraine and the Bidens, including omitting important details and failing to disclose that the sources used by Solomon were his own attorneys Victoria Toensing and Joseph diGenova — both close associates of Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. = Fox News = In October 2019, it was reported that Solomon was joining Fox News as an opinion contributor. An internal Fox News research briefing book warned that \\"John Solomon played an indispensable role in the collection and domestic publication\\" of parts of the Trump-Ukraine \\"disinformation campaign,\\" The Daily Beast reported in February 2020. = Just The News = In January 2020, Solomon founded Just The News, a national news agency. He hosts a podcast, John Solomon Reports.  Reception  Paul McCleary, writing for the Columbia Journalism Review in 2007, wrote that Solomon had earned a reputation for hyping stories without solid foundation. In 2012, Mariah Blake, writing for the Columbia Journalism Review, wrote that Solomon \\"has a history of bending the truth to his storyline,\\" and that he \\"was notorious for massaging facts to conjure phantom scandals.\\" During the 2004 presidential election between George W. Bush and John Kerry, Thomas Lang wrote for the Columbia Journalism Review that a Solomon story for the Associated Press covered criticism of John Kerry's record on national security appeared to mirror a research report released by the Republican National Committee. Lang wrote that Solomon's story was \\"a clear demonstration of the influence opposition research is already having on coverage of the [presidential] campaign.\\" The Washington Post wrote in September 2019 that Solomon's \\"recent work has been trailed by claims that it is biased and lacks rigor.\\" The Post noted that Solomon had done award- winning investigative work during his early career, but that his work had taken a pronounced conservative bent from the late 2000s and onwards. According to Foreign Policy magazine, Solomon had \\"grown into a prominent conservative political commentator with a somewhat controversial track record.\\" In 2007, Deborah Howell, then-ombudsman at The Washington Post, criticized a story that Solomon wrote for The Post which had suggested impropriety by Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards in a real estate purchase; Solomon's reporting omitted context which would have made clear that there was no impropriety. Progressive news outlets ThinkProgress, Media Matters for America and Crooked Media have argued that Solomon's reporting has a conservative bias and that there are multiple instances of inaccuracies. According to The Intercept, Just Security and The Daily Beast, Solomon helps to advance right-wing and pro-Trump conspiracy theories. The New Republic described Solomon's columns for The Hill as \\"right-wing fever dreams.\\" Independent journalist Marcy Wheeler accused Solomon of manufacturing fake scandals which suggested wrongdoing by those conducting probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Reporters who worked under Solomon as an editor have said that he encouraged them to bend the truth to fit a pre- existing narrative. In January 2018, Solomon published a report for The Hill suggesting that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page had foreknowledge of a Wall Street Journal article and that they themselves had leaked to the newspaper. According to the Huffington Post, Solomon's reporting omitted that the Wall Street Journal article Strzok and Page were discussing was critical of Hillary Clinton and the FBI, Strzok and Page expressed dismay at the fallout from the article, and Strzok and Page criticized unauthorized leaks from the FBI. According to the Huffington Post, \\"Solomon told HuffPost he was not authorized to speak and does not comment on his reporting. He may simply have been unaware of these three facts when he published his story. But they provide crucial context to an incomplete narrative that has been bouncing around the right-wing echo chamber all week.\\"  Awards  Solomon has received a number of prestigious awards for investigative journalism, among them the 2008 Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award and the Society of Professional Journalists' National Investigative Award, which he won together with CBS News' 60 Minutes for Evidence of Injustice; in 2002, the Associated Press's Managing Editors Enterprise Reporting Award for What The FBI Knew Before September 11, 2001, and the Gramling Journalism Achievement Award for his coverage of the war on terrorism; in 1992, the White House Correspondents' Association's Raymond Clapper Memorial Award for an investigative series on Ross Perot.

These teachings have often been exemplified by Islamic prophet Muhammad as displayed in his sayings and practices. To the Muslims, Islam is what the Quran has instructed to do and how Muhammad has put them into practice. Thus, the understanding of any Islamic topic generally rely on these two. Social welfare in Islam In Islamic tradition, the idea of social welfare has been presented as one of its principal values, and the practice of social service at its various forms has been instructed and encouraged. A Muslim's religious life remains incomplete if not attended by service to humanity. The following verse of the Quran is often cited to encapsulate the Islamic idea of social welfare: Similarly, duties to parents, neighbors, relatives, sick people, the old, and the minority group have been defined in Islam. In a long hadith recorded in Hadith Qudsi (sacred hadith), it is said that God, on the Day of Judgment, will be displeased with those who do not care for the sick people, and who do not give food to those who ask. God will interrogate them and demand explanation from them. This hadith is seen as a reminder of human beings’ obligation to respond to the needs of others. The individual, the family, the state, and the Non-governmental organizations and the government — all are responsible for the performance of social responsibilities, and for the promotion of social welfare. The Quran tells that the believers have been sent for the betterment of mankind, that they will promote what is good, and prevent what is wrong ().Maariful Quran (exegesis of the Quran) by Muhammad Shafi Usmani. Karachi. Chapter 3. However, this is to be carried out in the best possible manner: no individuals honor should be injured, and no harm should arise out of it.Hashmi, Sohail H., ed. (2009). Islamic Political Ethics: Civil Society, Pluralism, and Conflict. Princeton University Press. p. 68. . In Islamic tradition, the family has a greater role to play in properly educating its members and providing them with moral schooling so as to make them good members of society. The state has the responsibility to preserve the human rights of its citizens while various non- government institutions in a civil society are to carry out public services and charitable works.Hashmi (2009), p. 68-9 Rights of various groups in Islam =Rights of the parents and relatives= In Islam, special importance has been attached to the service and rights of parents. Respecting and obeying one's parents has been made a religious obligation, and ill-treatment to them is forbidden in Islamic jurisprudence and Islamic tradition. With regard to the rights of parents, the Quranic injunction is to behave well with then, to take care of them especially in their old age, not to be rude to them, and to show highest respect to them.Mufti Muhammad Shafi. Maariful Quran. English trans. By Muhammad Taqi UsmaniThe Quran says in this regard: \\"Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and do good to parents. If any one of them or both of them reach old age, do not say to them a word of contempt and do not scold them, and address them with respectful words, and submit yourself before them in humility out of compassion, and say, \\"My Lord, be merciful to them as they have brought me up in my childhood\\"\\" (). This injunction is to be applied regardless of parents' religious identity, that is, a Muslim person is to respect and serve their parents whether they be Muslim or non- Muslim.Cornell (2007), p. 97 Hadith literature provides plenty of instances where Muhammad has commanded his companions to be good and kind to their parents and to serve them in the best possible manner. Insulting or misbehaving with one's parents has been declared a major sin.Cornell (2007), p. 98 Mother, however, has been given priority over father in terms of receiving respect and service from children. The high status of mother in Islam is best exemplified by the saying of Muhammad that \\"paradise is at the feet of your mothers\\". Similarly, importance has also been attached to the rights of relatives. A two-fold approach is generally prescribed with regard to the duties to the relatives: keeping good relation with them, and offering financial help if necessary. Maintaining good relation with one's relatives has been emphasized, and severing ties with them has been admonished. It is said in the hadith, \\"The person who severs the bond of kinship will not enter Paradise.\\" =Rights of the neighbors= Regardless of a neighbor's religious identity, Islam tells the Muslims to treat their neighboring people in the best possible manners and not to cause any difficulty to them. The Quran tells the Muslims to stand by their neighbors in the latter's everyday needs. Muhammad is reported as saying, \\"A man is not a believer who fills his stomach while his neighbor is hungry.\\" One typical hadith on neighbors reads as follows: Narrated Abu Shuraih: The Prophet said, \\"By Allah, he does not believe! By Allah, he does not believe! By Allah, he does not believe!\\" It was said, \\"Who is that, O Allah's Apostle?\\" He said, \\"That person whose neighbor does not feel safe from his evil.\\" =Rights of children= Islamic law and the traditions of Muhammad have laid out the rights of children in Islam. Children have the rights to be fed, clothed, and protected until reaching adulthood; rights to be treated equally among the siblings; rights not to be forced by its step parents or its birth parents; and rights to education.I. A. Arshed. Parent-Child Relationship in Islam. Retrieved 2015-09-21Imam Al- Ghazali’s views on children's education Parents are also responsible for teaching their children basic Islamic beliefs, religious duties and good moral qualities like proper mannerism, honesty, truthfulness, modesty, and generosity.Campo (2009), p. 137 The Quran forbids harsh and oppressive treatment of orphaned children while urging kindness and justice towards them. It also condemns those who do not honor and feed the orphaned children (Quran ).Muhammad Shafi Usmani. Maariful Quran. English trans. By Muhammad Taqi Usmani. Tafsir of 89:17-18 Muhammad has been described as being very fond of children in general. In one Islamic tradition, Muhammad ran after Hussein, his grandson, in a game until he caught him. He comforted a child whose pet nightingale had died. Muhammad played many games with children, joked with them and befriended them. Muhammad also showed love to children of other religions. Once he visited his Jewish neighbor's son when the child was sick. =Rights of the minorities= Today, minority rights in several Muslim countries are severely curtailed. Historically, however, non-Muslim minorities have frequently enjoyed greater freedom in Muslim lands. This is evident from its early beginnings through later caliphates, included the Ottoman and Mughal Empires. These freedoms were enjoyed by the people of the Book, as well as by other non-Muslim peoples, many of whom still live in these lands today after over 1300 years of Muslim rule. The protection of minority rights is regarded as imperative under Islamic law which is in harmony with other international laws for the minority. =Repudiation of racial discrimination= In human history, racial discrimination has long been a cause of injustice. One important aspect of Islam is that it regards human beings as equal children of Adam. As a religion, Islam does not recognize the racial discrimination among people. In his Farewell Sermon, Muhammad repudiated the discrimination based on race and color. Islam recognizes no distinction among human beings based on color, language or tribe. All are considered equal in receiving human rights and in discharge duties. According to Islamic teaching, no privileged or chosen class exists except those having piety or moral excellence.Hashmi (2009), p. 62 A Quranic injunction forbids the Muslims to underestimate others. Assuming that there will be natural differences in social status and income among individuals which is the natural outcome due to the differences in personal talents and efforts, a sense of brotherhood towards fellow Muslims and a general sense of humanity towards every human being have been suggested to be cultured to further establish equality in society.Hashmi (2009), p. 62 Economic welfare =Zakat= In Islam, zakat is a form of compulsory alms- giving, and a religious obligation for those Muslims who are financially affluent.Yusuf al-Qaradawi (1999), Monzer Kahf (transl.), Fiqh az-Zakat, Dar al Taqwa, London, Volume 1, , page XIX They are required to pay one-fortieth (2.5%) of their total income or money each year to those Muslims who are poor and helpless. The Quran says: 'And woe to those who join gods with Allah, who practice not regular charity, and who deny the Hereafter' (). Zakat is considered by Muslims to be an act of piety through which one expresses concern for the well-being of fellow Muslims, as well as preserving social harmony between the wealthy and the poor. Zakat promotes a more equitable redistribution of wealth and fosters a sense of solidarity amongst members of the Ummah. =Sadaqah= Sadaqah means voluntary charity which is given out of compassion, love, friendship (fraternity), religious duty, or generosity. Both the Quran and the hadith have put much emphasis on spending money for the welfare of needy people. The Quran says: 'Spend something (in charity) out of the substance which We have bestowed on you, before Death should come to any of you' (). One of the early teachings of Muhammad was that God expects men to be generous with their wealth and not to be miserly (Quran ). Accumulating wealth without spending them to address the needs of the poor is generally prohibited and admonished. Moral behavior Islamic tradition holds that moral qualities and good actions elevate the status of a man. The Quran and the hadith serve as the primary source of moral and ethical guidance in Islamic theology. Both the Quran and the hadith often speak in emphatic manners to instruct the Muslims to adopt a morally good character. In particular, respecting parents and elders, having love for the younger, greeting people in correct manner, showing kindness to fellow people, caring for the sick, asking permission before entering into others' house, speaking the truth, and avoiding rude and false speech have been emphasized. The typical Islamic teaching is that imposing a penalty on an offender in proportion to their offense is permissible and just; but forgiving the offender is better. To go one step further by offering a favor to the offender is regarded the highest excellence. Muhammad said, \\"The best among you are those who have the best manners and character\\". To the Muslims, the examples of moral virtues set by Muhammad and his companions serve as guidance both practically and theologically. The Cairo Declaration on human rights Adopted in Cairo, Egypt, in 1990,Brems, E (2001). \\"Islamic Declarations of Human Rights\\". Human rights: universality and diversity: Volume 66 of International studies in human rights. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. pp. 241–84. . the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam provides an overview on the Islamic perspective on human rights, and affirms Islamic sharia as its sole source. It declares its purpose to be \\"general guidance for Member States of the OIC in the field of human rights\\". The Declaration starts by saying \\"All men are equal in terms of basic human dignity\\" (but not equal \\"human rights\\") and it forbids \\"discrimination on the basis of race, colour, language, belief, gender, religion, political affiliation, social status or other considerations\\". The Declaration especially emphasizes on issues like \\"preservation of human life\\", \\"right to privacy\\", \\"right to marriage\\", prohibition of forceful conversion, protection against arbitrary arrest and torture. It also guarantees presumption of innocence until proven guilty, \\"full right to freedom and self-determination\\", and freedom of expression.

It was discovered on 3 January 1989, by Japanese amateur astronomer Takuo Kojima at the YGCO Chiyoda Station in the northern Kantō region of Japan. The carbonaceous C-type asteroid has a rotation period of 9.7 hours and measures approximately in diameter. It was named after Alison Doane (1958–2017), curator of astronomical photographs at the Harvard College Observatory.  Orbit and classification  Alisondoane is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.8–3.1 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,397 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.26 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic.  Naming  This minor planet was named in honor of Alison Doane (1958–2017), curator of astronomical photographs at the Harvard College Observatory. She was also principal oboe with the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra from 1982 to 2001. The was published by the Minor Planet Center on 25 December 2015 ().  Physical characteristics  Alisondoane has been characterized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid by PanSTARRS photometric survey, as well as by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). = Lightcurves = A rotational lightcurve analysis by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec in 2007 rendered a rotation period of hours with a high brightness amplitude of 1.13 in magnitude (). A modeled lightcurves using photometric data from various sources, gave a sidereal period of hours and two spin axes of (123.0°, −51.0°) and (314.0°, −60.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Alisondoane measures between 8.52 and 9.99 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.04 and 0.122.

Dagashi are comparable to American penny candy. The word dagashi is derived from the Japanese words da (\\"futile\\" or \\"negligible\\") and kashi (snacks). The low price and fun packaging is designed to attract children with small allowances, and dagashi came to be known as the small candies that children can afford with pocket money. Most dagashi are packaged in bright, childish wrapping and sometimes come with a small toy or prize. The toys are often small figurines, and a common prize is a randomized prize that will allow the holder to claim a second free snack. Dagashi used to be sold in stores specializing primarily in dagashi called dagashiya (Japanese: 駄菓子屋), but are now increasingly sold in convenience stores as well.  History  Recreation of a dagashiya at Ōme Akasuka Fujio Kaikan Museum (Retro Museum of Packaging from the Showa Era, 1926-1989) While modern dagashi developed after World War II, dagashi has been around since the Edo period (1603-1868). Dagashi, made from starch or corn, was the commoner equivalent of the more expensive jōgashi, which was higher quality and made from white sugar. Modern dagashi experienced its greatest popularity in the post-war Shōwa period (from the 1950s to the early 1980s) when dagashiya (stores that specialized in dagashi) were common and a staple after-school hangout spot for younger students. During the Bubble Economy period (1986–1991), the amount of spending money schoolchildren had access to rapidly increased. Many dagashiya began to diversify their products or were replaced by convenience stores. As of 2018, dagashi can still be found in the occasional dagashiya, in convenience stores, or ordered online. Culture expos in Japan (especially for schools) sometimes include dagashi and dagashiya displays.  Types  The key considerations for companies producing dagashi are: * Low price - each piece should retail between 10 and 200 yen, a reasonable amount for a school child * Shelf stability - the lack of refrigeration or air conditioning in traditional dagashiya in the summer should not cause spoilage or affect taste * Attractiveness to children  Wrappers and mascots - distinctive to help pre- literate children in making selections and promote brand loyalty  Interactiveness - dagashi that can be played with extends the amount of time the child has with a small portion of candy, including candy cigarettes, Fue Ramune (a hard candy that can be played as a whistle), neri-ame, etc.  Prizes, including a chance to win another dagashi, figurines, or menko Dagashi include hard candy, gum, chocolates, cakes, and certain types of pastries, like donuts. Dagashi also includes snacks such as juice powders and flavorings, potato and corn snacks, small cups of ramen, rice crackers, flavored squid, and preserved fruit.  Dagashiya  A dagashiya in Yokohama Dagashiya are the traditional stores that sell dagashi. Besides dagashi, dagashiya often sell small toys and may have coin-operated arcade-style games or gashapon. During the post-war Showa period, children often stopped by a dagashiya after school to purchase the cheap snacks and socialize with each other and the shop owners. Though in decline due to convenience stores, dagashiya can still be found in Japan, with around 50 in the Tokyo area. Today, dagashiya are regarded as nostalgic and are frequently found in resort or vacation towns.  Cultural references  The oldest continuously operating dagashiya in Tokyo is Kami-kawaguchiya, which was established in 1781.The Nostalgic Taste of “Dagashi” Snacks. Nippon.com. Published September 1, 2013. It is located on the grounds of Kishibojin Shrine and served as the model for the dagashiya in the Studio Ghibli film Only Yesterday. With the proliferation of convenience stores and the falling Japanese birthrate, traditional dagashiyas have been declining rapidly. However, dagashi and dagashiyas have attained more attention in Japanese pop culture with the release of the anime Dagashi Kashi. The anime covers some of the most popular dagashi, as well as more obscure kinds.

Life  Morgenstern was a student of his father, Johann Christoph Morgenstern (1697-1767), who was a valet and portrait-painter in the service of the princes of the House of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. His brother, Friedrich Wilhelm Christoph Morgenstern, was born in 1739 and later followed his father in his position. The siblings are the second in a total of five generations in this artist family, with Johann Ludwig Ernst being the first to leave their Thuringian homeland. Already in his youth he drew horses and battle scenes after copperplate engravings of Georg Philipp Rugendas with such talent that his father was able to give only little support. From 1766 he attended the Academy of the Picture Gallery in Salzdahlum, where he worked under Ludwig Wilhelm Busch (1703-1772). This path led him to Hamburg in 1768, where he restored paintings, and to Frankfurt am Main in 1769, where he found himself admitted into the workshop of Christian Georg Schütz the Elder. After three years in Darmstadt, he returned again to Frankfurt in 1772. Interior of a Gothic Church, 1793, Frankfurt am Main His original plan of going to Utrecht was dashed when he gained entry into the studio of Johann Andreas Benjamin Nothnagel (1729-1804), where for several years he was active in the fields of landscape, horse, and genre painting. Through his previous teacher Schütz, in this time he became acquainted with the Swiss architecture painter Johann Vögelin. He grew so enthusiastic in this genre that, from this time on, Morgenstern almost exclusively occupied himself in this niche of painting, primarily paintings of churches. Through his marriage to Anna Maria Alleinz, Morgenstern obtained civil rights in Frankfurt on 17 September 1776; by transferring a masterpiece which represented the interior of a church, he simultaneously acquired master rights. His marriage produced a son, Johann Friedrich Morgenstern, born on 8 October 1777, who later also became a well-known painter. Morgenstern remained active in his field until his old age; contemporary reports mention most of all, for a miniaturist, the extraordinary fact that he worked to the end without glasses. He died on 13 November 1819 at the age of 81; his grave at Peterskirchhof has not been preserved. The Frankfurt pastor and historian Anton Kirchner wrote his obituary, in which he recognized his constantly cheerful and contented disposition. Northern side of the Zeil from the Red House to the Weidenhof  Works  In his early years, Morgenstern worked as a painter of battle scenes and landscapes; in his later and more prolific years from 1780 to 1810 he mostly worked on church and building interiors in miniature form. The paintings of this period were captivating for their perfect perspective and colorful treatment, lighting, and their details. His corpus was primarily composed of oil paintings, seldom etchings, at first often on copper, which increased their brilliance. His works often have, next to their artistic, immeasurable historic value as almost photographically exact representations of churches shortly before the turmoil of the French Revolution, which caused a secularization as well as a radical classical remodeling. During his lifetime, Morgenstern's paintings, as Philipp Friedrich Gwinner noted in 1862, were \\"bought straight from the easel, as it were\\" for the best of prices, as often for local private collections as in foreign European countries. His works that are found in museum collections are mainly located in the museum in Frankfurt am Main. Besides painting, he also occupied himself with restorations, which since his stay in Hamburg had been formed on important foundations. Over the years the skill of his hands reached that of the old masters: in the scope of his restoration work he frequently made small, private copies. He gradually put together a private, double-door cabinet of miniature oil paintings, which his son continued but which was only completed by his grandson Carl Morgenstern (1811-1893). The middle part of the cabinet contained 75, while the doors another 65, paintings. The Morgenstern Cabinet of Miniatures was sold to a Frankfurt art dealer in 1857 and around 1980 was bought and moved back to the Historisches Museum Frankfurt, although it no longer contains the original assortment of pictures.

Run by the Stubbs family, it operated between around 1923 and 2006. It produced white or brine salt from naturally occurring underground brine using natural or wild pumping. The salt was extracted by vacuum evaporation and was of a high quality. It was used for human consumption under the brandname \\"Selva\\" and in the pharmaceutical industry; New Cheshire was the only British company to supply salt for pharmaceutical use. In its later years, New Cheshire was the biggest of the few remaining family-owned salt producers. From the mid-1980s until its closure, it was the only salt works in the UK still to use the natural brine pumping method. Early history of salt extraction in Wincham and the Northwich area After a rock salt bed was discovered north of Northwich in 1670, Northwich swiftly overtook Nantwich and Middlewich to become the largest salt producer in Cheshire.Hodson, pp. 140–42 Mining began in the village of Marston in 1781, a few years after the opening of the North Staffordshire (later Trent and Mersey) Canal, which was used to transport the salt. In the 1850s salt works were established in Marston, and in the 1860s and 1870s in the adjacent village of Wincham, predominantly following the line of the canal. The Salt Branches Railway connected Wincham to Northwich from 1867. By the late 19th century, Wincham was a flourishing salt-manufacturing location, with several open-pan salt works as well as rock salt mines. Many of the salt works in Wincham were short lived, but some amalgamated to form Wincham Salt Works, which was located on the site of the New Cheshire Works in 1877. It was sold to the Salt Union in 1888, and demolished shortly afterwards.Ashmore, p. 71 New Cheshire Salt Works The Stubbs family had a history in the Cheshire salt business dating back to the early 18th century, and had owned salt works near Northwich in the 19th century. The New Cheshire Salt Works was founded in 1922 or 1923 by Alfred Stubbs and other members of the Stubbs family, and remained in that family for five generations.Kurlansky, pp. 326–30 The factory was in Wincham at , to the north east of the Trent and Mersey Canal. It had two chimneys in red brick, one marked with their brand \\"Selva\\" in capitals. By 1982, New Cheshire was the only salt works remaining in Wincham, the nearby open-pan Sunbeam Salt Works having closed in the early 1970s. Naturally occurring underground brine from the Wincham brinefield was pumped to the surface via a borehole. Such natural or wild brine pumping differs from controlled brine pumping, where water is pumped underground into rock to dissolve rock salt deposits.Tigwell, pp. 47–50 The process has historically been associated with subsidence, which has been a major problem in the Northwich area. The brine was purified by treatment with sodium carbonate and lime, and the salt extracted using a closed-pan partial vacuum evaporation method. The technique was adapted from the sugar industry, and had first been applied to salt extraction in 1887 in Silver Springs, New York. First tried commercially in the UK as early as 1901, several British manufacturers started up vacuum evaporator plants using a small Mirlees-type evaporator in parallel with their open-pan operations after the First World War. James Stubbs had learned about the method of vacuum evaporation in Michigan in 1905, and the New Cheshire Works was one of the early companies to adopt the vacuum evaporation method, importing an evaporator in the 1930s. Described as \\"magnificent\\" by journalist Mark Kurlansky, the company's first evaporator had three chambers; it had an Art Deco design, and was decorated with stripes in dark and pale wood, with brass fittings. The company updated the evaporator in the 1950s and the 1990s. In the 2000s, the works was using a small Svenson system with three evaporator chambers (termed \\"effects\\"). During the 1960s, most of the smaller vacuum plants closed and two companies, Staveley Industries and Cerebos, merged to form British Salt. By the 1970s, there were only three companies using the technology, ICI, British Salt and the much smaller New Cheshire Works, which used its small evaporator to produce a relatively low volume of a high-purity product that was not economic at the two large works. The use of natural pumping declined after the Second World War, and mostly ceased during the 1970s, but New Cheshire continued to use the process. From the mid-1980s until its closure in 2006, it was the only salt works in the UK to use the natural brine pumping method. New Cheshire was the third-largest salt producer in the UK in 1986, after ICI and British Salt. At that date, the annual salt output exceeded 50,000 tons, of which a quarter was sold to consumers under the brandname \\"Selva\\". The vacuum process used at New Cheshire was more expensive than that used by other British manufacturers, as well as European manufacturers exporting to the UK. The process produced pure vacuum-dried salt with less than 0.1% water content, which is suitable for use in human food, as well as a variety of other purposes including animal food, such as salt licks, water softening tablets, dyes and textile production, such as leather preparation. New Cheshire Salt Works was the only company in the UK to produce a very pure product with less than 0.01% water content for use in the pharmaceutical industry. This required the plant to be shut down and cleaned, as well as further drying of the pure vacuum-dried salt with hot-air driers. In 2005, the works could produce up to 80,000 tonnes a year, and was operating at close to capacity; the total annual white salt production in the UK was estimated at a million tonnes. New Cheshire was then one of the last three commercial salt producers in the UK. The company was sold that year to British Salt, in an acquisition that was investigated by the Competition Commission in May but allowed to go ahead on 8 November 2005. Although the works had been profitable in 2003 and 2004, the Commission ruled that it would soon be rendered uneconomic by a number of factors, particularly increased energy prices. British Salt announced the closure of the Wincham works a few weeks later, and it closed in June 2006. At the time of closure it employed 60 people. The works site, an area of 198 acres, was purchased by a development company early in 2007, and the site has since been demolished and redeveloped. Some of the company's records are archived by Cheshire Archives and Local Studies. See also *Salt in Cheshire *Lion Salt Works, in the nearby village of Marston References Sources *Ashmore O.

Santos Memorial National High School (MISMNHS) is a public secondary school in Sitio Lambac, San Juan, Taytay, Rizal, Philippines. It was formerly an annex building of Taytay National High School and now an independent public secondary school. The school is named after Manuel Ignacio Santos who was then served as Municipal Mayor of Taytay (1946-1947),(1952-1960) and (1980-1981). History Manuel I. Santos Memorial National High School was founded in 2000 as Taytay National High School - Manggahan Floodway Extension. It was located along the riverside at San Juan, Floodway, Taytay, Rizal. In its first school year (2002-2003), the school was under the supervision of Mrs. Cynthia M. Cruz, as principal and Mrs. Mercidita L. Cu, as Teacher In-Charge. During that time, the school had only one unit building occupied by first year and second year students, while only ten dedicated teachers were serving the school. Due to rapid increase in the number of enrolees, another one-unit building with four classrooms was built to accommodate the students and staff. Under Cruz, with the support of the local government, stakeholders and teachers, continuous improvements and repairs of available school facilities were initiated. On July 2003, Cruz, lobbied the initial separation of TNHS – MFE from its mother school. With the support and assistance of Mayor June V. Zapanta and PTCA officers, she made a proposal to Governor Casimiro M. Ynares regarding their desire to make the school an independent institution. The approval of the said request was denied until the end of 2003. After a year, Miss Nerissa N. De Leon served as Teacher In-Charge from June 2003 to March 2004 while the school was under the supervision of the same principal Cruz. The absence of good facilities, insufficient instructional materials and teachers to address the far from ideal teacher-faculty ratio have plagued the new school administration. In SY 2004-2006, Mrs. Mercidita L. Cu was replaced as Teacher In-Charge of the school and Mrs. Loida A. Alcantara served as the new principal. Over the years, the rapid and continuous growth of student population posted considerable problems. The new administrator pushed for construction of new building and procurement of supplies, books, and other instructional materials. These requests still failed to materialize. DepEd approved the proposal regarding the separation of TNHS – MFE from its mother school and granted its new and permanent name – Manuel I. Santos Memorial National High School on June 13, 2006 in honor of the late Manuel I. Santos, former Mayor of the Municipality of Taytay. On January 22, 2006, during the term of office of Alcantara as principal and Cu as Teacher In-charge, the students and staff moved to their new and permanent location at Sitio Lambak, San Juan Floodway, Taytay, Rizal. The school that time had 12 classrooms. Its ground breaking ceremony was attended by government officials, PTCA officers and other stakeholders. In May of school year 2005-2006, Mr. Celestino A. Santiago, took over as the Teacher In-charge of the school. Due to its growing population, additional buildings and facilities were constructed through the support of government officials and sponsorship of LGUs and NGOs. When Santiago was promoted as principal of the school in 2008, additional buildings and facilities as funds became available through government appropriations and donations from private institutions. He had been the school head until May 31, 2011. At present, the school is under the supervision of the newly assigned principal, Mr. Virgilio P. Ramos. The school has a total of 3,601 students with 996 first year students, 899 second year students, 936 third year students, 770 fourth year students, 1 guidance counselor, 1 book keeper, 1 disbursing officer, 94 teaching staff, 3 non-teaching, and 6 maintenance personnel.

She had five siblings. Her parents, Rose McQueen and her husband, Joseph Rector (both born 1881) were African descendants of the Muscogee Creek Nation Creek Indians before the Civil War and which became part of the Muscogee Creek Nation after the Treaty of 1866. As such, they and their descendants were listed as freedmen on the Dawes Rolls, by which they were entitled to land allotments under the Treaty of 1866 made by the United States with the Five Civilized Tribes. Consequently, nearly 600 black children, or Muscogee Freedmen minors as they were called, were granted land allotments, and Sarah Rector was allotted .Bolden 18 This was a mandatory step in the process of integration of the Indian Territory with Oklahoma Territory to form what is now the State of Oklahoma. Sarah's father Joseph was the son of John Rector, a Muscogee Freedman.Bolden 9 John Rector's father Benjamin McQueen, was enslaved by Reilly Grayson who was a Muscogee Creek Indian. John Rector's mother Mollie McQueen was enslaved by Muscogee leader, Opothole Yahola who fought in the Seminole wars and split with the tribe, moving his followers to Kansas. Oil strike and wealth The parcel allotted to Sarah Rector was located in Glenpool, from where she and her family lived. It was considered inferior infertile soil, not suitable for farming, with better land being reserved for white settlers and members of the tribe. The family lived simply but not in poverty; however, the $30 annual property tax on Sarah's parcel was such a burden that her father petitioned the Muskogee County Court to sell the land. His petition was denied because of certain restrictions placed on the land, so he was required to continue paying the taxes. To help cover this expense, in February 1911, Joseph Rector leased Sarah's parcel to the Standard Oil Company. In 1913, the independent oil driller B.B. Jones drilled a well on the property which produced a \\"gusher\\" that began to bring in of oil a day. Rector began to receive a daily income of $300 from this strike. The law at the time required full-blooded Indians, black adults, and children who were citizens of Indian Territory with significant property and money, to be assigned \\"well-respected\\" white guardians. Thus, as soon as Rector began to receive this windfall, there was pressure to change Rector's guardianship from her parents to a local white resident named T.J. (or J.T.) Porter, an individual known to the family. Rector's allotment subsequently became part of the Cushing-Drumright Oil Field. In October 1913, Rector received royalties of $11,567. As news of Rector's wealth spread worldwide, she began to receive requests for loans, money gifts, and marriage proposals, despite the fact that she was only 12 years old. Given her wealth, in 1913 the Oklahoma Legislature made an effort to have her declared white, so that she could ride in a first class car on the trains, as befitted her position. In 1914, an African American journal, The Chicago Defender, began to take an interest in Rector, just as rumors began to fly that she was a white immigrant who was being kept in poverty. The newspaper published an article claiming that her estate was being mismanaged by her family and that she was uneducated, and had a poor quality of life. This caused National African American leaders Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. DuBois to become concerned about her welfare. In June of that year, a special agent for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), James C. Waters Jr, sent a memo to Dubois regarding her situation. Waters had been corresponding with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the United States Children's Bureau over concerns regarding the mismanagement of Rector's estate. He wrote of her white financial guardian: > Is it not possible to have her cared for in a decent manner and by people of > her own race, instead of by a member of a race which would deny her and her > kind the treatment accorded a good yard dog? This prompted Dubois to establish the Children's Department of the NAACP, which would investigate claims of white guardians who were suspected of depriving black children of their land and wealth. Washington also intervened to help the Rector family. In October of that year, she was enrolled in the Children's School, a boarding school at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, headed by Washington. Upon graduation, she attended the Institute. Rector was already a millionaire by the time she had turned 18. She owned stocks, bonds, a boarding house, businesses, and a 2,000-acre piece of prime river bottomland. At that point, she left Tuskegee and, with her entire family, moved to Kansas City, Missouri. She purchased a house on 12th Street, that is still there and known as the Rector House. The house has been purchased by a local nonprofit with the intention of restoration and historical and cultural preservation. Soon after moving to Kansas City she married a local man, Kenneth Campbell. The wedding was a very private affair, with only her mother and the bridegroom's paternal grandmother present. The couple had three sons before divorcing in 1930. Later life Rector lived a comfortable life, enjoying her wealth. She had a taste for fine clothing and fast cars. She was frequently ticketed by the police of the city for speeding. She hosted frequent gatherings at her home for the leading members of the nation's African American community. She also was remembered for sending her chauffeur to drive the children of the neighborhood to school. Her husband partnered in 1928 with the auto dealer Homer Roberts and moved to Chicago to open Roberts- Campbell Motors, the second African American owned auto dealership. New car sales faltered with the onset of the depression and the venture soon closed. In 1934, Sarah married William Crawford. They owned a restaurant where they entertained the likes of Count Basie and Duke Ellington. Rector died on July 22, 1967, at the age of 65. Her remains were buried in the city cemetery of her hometown of Taft.

It was discovered on 2 September 1995, by American astronomer Timothy Spahr at the Catalina Station near Tucson, Arizona, who named it for his parents, Mary & Phil Spahr.  Orbit and classification  Maryphil is a core member of the Phocaea family (), a prominent family of stony asteroids with their largest members being 25 Phocaea and 587 Hypsipyle. Unlike this asteroid, many members of the relatively eccentric Phocaea family are Mars-crossing asteroids. This asteroid orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.8–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 7 months (1,312 days; semi-major axis of 2.35 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.23 and an inclination of 23° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at the discovering Catalina Station on 30 August 1992, just three nights prior to its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  Pan-STARRS photometric survey characterized Maryphil as an S-type and Q-type asteroid, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) assumes it to be a common S-type, which is also the overall spectral type form members of the Phocaea family. = Rotation period = In November 2006, a rotational lightcurve of Maryphil was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 11.653 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.44 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Maryphil measures 5.948 and 6.72 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.236 and 0.315, respectively. CALL assumes a standard albedo for Phocaea asteroids of 0.23, and calculates a diameter of 6.96 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 13.0.  Naming  This minor planet was named by the discoverer Timothy Spahr in honor of his supportive parents, Mary Clark (born 1938) and Phil Spahr (born 1938). The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 3 July 2012 ().

The lake is formed by a dam across the north fork of Pacheco Creek, whose waters reach Monterey Bay by way of the Pajaro River.  North Fork Dam  The lake's waters are impounded by the North Fork Dam, an earthen dam built in 1939. The dam is high and long and contains of material. Its crest is above mean sea level.

The National Map, accessed February 6, 2016 Resident rainbow (the landlocked form of steelhead) trout successfully rear in fast-water habitats above the dam. They grow rapidly and reach smolt size by the end of their first summer. In many years in late spring, prior to reservoir releases for agriculture, low stream flows and high water temperatures severely impact steelhead fry and small juveniles.  Pacheco Reservoir Expansion Project  In 2018, the Santa Clara Valley Water District (known as \\"Valley Water\\"), Pacheco Pass Water District, and San Benito County Water District were awarded $484.5 million from California’s Water Quality, Supply and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014 to expand Pacheco Reservoir from its current operational capacity of 5,500 Acre-foot to 140,000 acre-feet. The expansion project involves building an earthen dam made of rock and soil upstream of the existing dam, a pump station, a pipeline, and other related infrastructure. The total project cost is projected to be $969,000,000. In addition to runoff from the North Fork Pacheco Creek watershed, the reservoir will store imported water pumped from the San Luis Reservoir, which is located to the east along Highway 152 and is part of the Central Valley Project (CVP) San Felipe Division in Merced and Santa Clara counties. The imported water would be supplied by the United States Bureau of Reclamation under contract to Valley Water and the San Benito County Water District. In a drought or other emergency, the increased storage capacity will supply up to 1.4 million residents with water for a year. Water flow from the reservoir into Pacheco Creek will be managed to keep the creek flowing and improve the quality of habitat for South Central California Coast steelhead trout. Eight wildlife refuges in Central California will also be supplied with water. Valley Water is currently exploring the project design and evaluating environmental impacts under a cost-sharing agreement with the California Water Commission. The draft environmental impact report is expected by 2022, with construction expected to begin in 2024.

Harrison (1901 – November 5, 1991) was a Canadian mycologist. He was for many years a plant pathologist at what is now the Atlantic Food and Horticulture Research Centre in Nova Scotia. After retirement, he contributed to the taxonomy of the Agaricomycotina, particularly the tooth fungi of the families Hydnaceae and Bankeraceae, in which he described several new species. Early life and career Originally from New Brunswick, Harrison graduated from Nova Scotia Agricultural College in 1922, and, in 1924, from the Ontario Agricultural College with a B.Sc. in agriculture. He earned an MSc in plant pathology from Macdonald Campus of McGill University a year later. A doctoral degree he started at the University of Toronto in 1929 was abandoned due to the Great Depression. He established a herbarium of mycological specimens where he was employed for many years at the Kentville Research Station (now the Atlantic Food and Horticulture Research Centre); most of his collections are now housed at the Canadian National Mycological Herbarium. His early research concerned the fungal infestation of plants, such as that of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum on beans (Phaseolus). Working with John Frederick DeWitt Hockey, they made many contributions to the control and prevention of diseases of horticultural crops. They were among the first to use the sticky slide spore trap to estimate the densities of fungal spores. Post-retirement activities After his retirement in 1966, Harrison began studying the mushroom-producing species of the Agaricomycotina more avidly. Collections forays throughout Nova Scotia, in the Great Smoky Mountains, New Mexico, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the Pacific Northwest led to him describing several new species in the genera Steccherinum, and tooth fungi in Hydnellum, Sarcodon, Phellodon. Harrison died in Kentville, Nova Scotia, in 1991. The Department of Biology at Acadia University has a mycology laboratory named in his honour. Eponymous species The tooth fungus Sarcodon harrisonii was named in his honor by Richard Baird, who noted \\"Dr. Kenneth Harrison the North American expert on the stipitate hydnums.

Born in the Netherlands, he and his brother Henry J. Duveen founded in Britain the firm of Duveen Brothers. Early life He was born in Meppel in the Netherlands on 8 May 1843, the son of Eva (van Minden) and Joseph Henoch Duveen, who were both from Dutch Jewish families. His grandfather, Henry Duveen, who had first settled in Meppel during the Napoleonic Wars, was the youngest son of Joseph Duveen of Giessen, army contractor to the King of Saxony; Napoleon's repudiation of the debts of the Saxon forces ruined this Duveen, whose twelve sons were then driven to seek their fortunes in different countries. Joseph left Meppel in 1866 and settled in Hull, starting as a general dealer. He possessed a good knowledge of Nanking porcelain, then coming into fashion; cargo loads of this had been brought to Holland by the early Dutch traders with China. He purchased large quantities, which he shipped it to Hull, and found a ready market in London. Expansion of business In partnership with his younger brother Henry he secured the chief American trade in Oriental porcelain, and in 1877 opened a branch house at Fifth Avenue, New York. They formed many notable collections in America, and they largely helped in the formation of the Taft, Widener, Gould, Altmann and Morgan art collections. In 1879 the brothers erected fine art galleries adjoining the Pantheon in Oxford Street, London, and took an important share in the fine art trade, extending their interests in several branches, particularly in that of old tapestry, of which they became the largest purchasers. The Duveens built spacious art galleries in Old Bond Street in the spring of 1894. From 1890 onwards they purchased pictures and were large buyers at the Mulgrave Castle sale of 1890 and at the Murrieta sale two years later. They purchased the whole of the Hainauer collection of Renaissance objets d'art for about £250,000 in June 1906, and in 1907 the Rodolphe Kann collection of pictures and objets d'art in Paris for nearly £0.75 million. Benefaction John Singer Sargent's portrait of Ellen Terry Duveen became wealthy, and was generous in benefaction of art galleries. He was a subscriber to the public purchase of Velasquez's \\"Rokeby Venus\\" for the National Gallery in 1906, and in the same year he presented John Singer Sargent's portrait of Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth, which he bought at the Irving sale at Christie's in 1905 for £1200, to the Tate Gallery. In May 1908 he undertook the cost (about £35,000) of an extension to the Tate Gallery. It was designed by W. H. Romaine-Walker: five rooms were added to the main floor and two to the lower. It allowed the gallery's paintings by J. M. W. Turner to be displayed, and was called the Turner Wing. It was completed in 1910.Extensions Archive journeys: Tate History. Retrieved 7 January 2018. He was knighted on 26 June 1908. Duveen died in Hyères, France, on 9 November 1908, and was buried at Willesden Jewish Cemetery. His wife Rosetta, daughter of Abraham Barnett of Hull, whom he married in 1869, survived him; they had a family of ten sons and four daughters.

In 1923 the club became the first official national champion of Suriname. History Olympia was founded as a Roman Catholic club on 27 January 1919, two days after the inauguration of their sporting grounds, the Katholieke Sport Centrale. Situated on the Patronaatterrein, the Katholieke Sport Centrale had been established as a replacement for the Gouvernementsplein as the primary playing field for organized football matches in Paramaribo at the time. The club were able to secure the first two official National championships of the SVB Hoofdklasse in 1923 and 1924. Many of the competing clubs at the time were under the impression that there was a religious bias at the Katholieke Sport Centrale towards the club, and that religious dogma tainted the competition. Olympia played at the top flight of the competition for the most part of the first half of the 20th Century, having seen their best period in the formative years of the sport, relegating to the lower divisions in the sixties, before folding shortly thereafter.

It is now a ruin, attracting tourists and locals alike. History Khetri Mahal was constructed by Bhopal Singh around 1770. Bhopal Singh was the grandson of Sardul Singh. Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh of Jaipur built his Hawa Mahal, also known as the Wind Palace, on the model of the Khetri Mahal, in 1799. Khetri in itself was considered to be the second wealthiest ‘Thikana’ under Jaipur. Architecture Khetri Mahal is located behind a series of lanes. It is a paragon of Shekhawati art and architecture. It is primarily known for its fine paintings and murals mainly supporting the Raghunath temple and Bhopalgarh fort. The palace is remarkable among buildings of its region because of the flow of wind through its open portals rather than stopped windows or doors. Wind Palace Architecture of Mahal Wherever structurally possible, the walls have been pierced with arched openings. The levels of the Palace are combined through a series of ramps, installed to facilitate the movement of horseback guests toward the terrace, which gives commanding views. Two small alcoves contain fragments of older paintings in the private chamber of Thakurs. Most of these paintings were executed in natural earth pigments. The interior rooms are open and colonnaded, the columns often surmounted with openwork and curved arches. Beautiful architecture design of Khetri Mahal Most of the rooms are connected through arched portals rather than with doors, and much of the masonry is covered with a pinkish plaster. One enters the palace via a student hostel at the base of the structure.
