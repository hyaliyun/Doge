In a racing career which lasted from July 2003 until October 2006 she ran nineteen times, competing in four different countries and won six times as well as being placed on seven occasions. As a juvenile she graduated from a maiden race victory to record her biggest success in the Group One Fillies' Mile. In the following year she was the beaten favourite for the 1000 Guineas but won the Strensall Stakes. She remained in training for two more seasons, winning the Pipalong Stakes and two editions of the Blandford Stakes. Apart from her wins, she reached the frame in the Coronation Stakes, Pretty Polly Stakes, Nassau Stakes and Prix Jean Romanet. At the end of her racing career she became broodmare for her owner, the Cheveley Park Stud. Background Red Bloom is a bay mare with a white blaze and two white socks bred by David and Patricia Thompson's Newmarket-based Cheveley Park Stud. She was sired by Selkirk an American-bred miler who won the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1991. As a breeding stallion, Selkirk's progeny include fifteen Group One winners including Wince, Cityscape (Dubai Duty Free), Leadership (Gran Premio di Milano) and Kastoria (Irish St Leger). Her dam, Red Camellia won three of her six races including the 1996 edition of the Prestige Stakes and was a great-granddaughter of Ouija, a broodmare whose other descendant have included Ouija Board, Ibn Bey, Teleprompter, Roseate Tern and Australia. Red Bloom was trained throughout her racing career by Michael Stoute at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =2003: two-year-old season= Red Bloom began her racing career in a six furlong maiden race at Newbury Racecourse on 18 July. She was made the 13/8 favourite in a thirteen-runner field but after challenging for the lead she appeared to be outpaced in the closing stages and finished third behind the outsiders Nataliya and Kunda. In the following month she started favourite for a similar event over seven furlongs at Newmarket and recorded her first success, leading for most of the way for most of the way and winning by two lengths from Silk Fan and ten others. The filly was then stepped up in class and distance for the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse on 27 September. The prevailing firm ground led to the late withdrawal of four horses including the strongly-fancied Irish filly Necklace. Ridden as on her debut by Kieren Fallon she started the 3/1 second favourite behind the previously undefeated Punctilious whilst the other five runners were River Belle (Princess Margaret Stakes), Ithaca (runner in the Prestige Stakes), Menhoubah (third in the Moyglare Stud Stakes) and the highly regarded maiden winners Sundrop and Tarot Card. Fallon settled the filly behind the leaders as Punctilious set the pace. Red Bloom overtook the favourite approaching the final furlong and won by a length and a half from Sundrop. After the race Fallon commented \\"She has killed them. She came there cruising, and no sooner has she hit the front than she pricked her ears and pulled up with me. Otherwise she would have been even more impressive. She's going the right way and has a big future\\". =2004: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old Red Bloom was made the favourite in a sixteen-runner field for the 191st running of the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course on 2 May. She had not contested a trial race but had performed impressively in a public training gallop at the course on 15 April. Fallon settled her behind the leaders but although she stayed on in the closing stages she never looked likely to win and finished fourth behind Attraction, Sundrop and Hathrah. At Royal Ascot in June she faced Attraction again in the Group One Coronation Stakes and was again beaten, finishing third behind the Guineas winner and the outsider Majestic Desert. In August the filly was dropped to Group Three class for the nine furlong Strensall Stakes at York Racecourse in which she was matched against male opposition and older horses for the first time. Ridden by Kevin Darley she was made favourite with her three opponents being Imperial Dancer (Premio Roma), Babodana (Lincoln Handicap) and Salselon (Premio Chiusura). After tracking the leader Babodana, she took the lead inside the final furlong and won by half a length from Salselon. After the race, Cheveley Park Stud's managing director Chris Richardson commented \\"It was a muddling early pace but she appeared to like the easy ground, and the further she went, the better\\". In September she was sent to Ireland for the Blandford Stakes at the Curragh in which she was moved up to race over ten furlongs for the first time. She started the 13/8 favourite but although she stayed on in the straight she finished only fourth of the thirteen runners behind the Geoff Wragg-trained five-year-old Monturani. =2005: four-year-old season= Red Bloom began her third season by starting favourite for the Group Three Dahlia Stakes at Newmarket on 1 May but finished lame in fifth place behind Tarfah. She recovered sufficiently to contest the Listed Pipalong Stakes over one mile at Pontefract Racecourse on 6 June and started 6/4 favourite ahead of Summitville, a mare who had won the May Hill Stakes in 2002. Ridden by Robert Winston, she tracked Summitville before overtaking her rival inside the final furlong and winning by a neck. Red Bloom was placed in her next three races, finishing second to Alexander Goldrun in the Pretty Polly Stakes, third to the same filly in the Nassau Stakes and second to Pride in the Prix Jean Romanet at Deauville Racecourse on 21 August. On 18 September she made her second appearance in the Blandford Stakes and started 15/8 favourite ahead of the Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Chelsea Rose and nine other fillies and mares. Racing on her favoured firm ground, she was positioned in third by Kieren Fallon before moving up to take the lead a quarter mile from the finish. Red Bloom opened up a clear advantage and stayed on in the closing stages to win by one and a half lengths and a length from Pictavia and Kinnaird. On her final appearance of the season she finished sixth of the nine runners behind Kinnaird in the Prix de l'Op√©ra at Longchamp Racecourse in October. =2006: five-year-old season= Red Bloom began her fourth season by finishing fourth behind Strawberry Dale in the Middleton Stakes at York in May. She then finished third behind her old rival Alexander Goldrun in the Pretty Polly Stakes before running third to Satwa Queen when favourite for the Prix Jean Romanet. On 19 September the mare attempted to repeat her 2005 as she contested the Blandford Stakes for the third time. Racing on soft ground she was ridden by Jamie Spencer and started 11/8 favourite ahead of Race for the Stars, an Aidan O'Brien-trained three- year old whose wins included the Oh So Sharp Stakes and the Denny Cordell Fillies Stakes. The best fancied of the other nine runners were Strawberry Dale and Blessyourpinksox (Kilboy Estate Stakes, Dance Design Stakes). In a repeat of her performance of the previous year she settled in the third, took the lead two furlongs out, broke clear of the field and stayed on in the final furlong to win by one and three quarter length. Sina Cova finished second ahead of Paris Winds and Be My Queen. Spencer commented \\"She's a classy filly... [Michael Stoute] told me that this was her time of year and that she always comes to herself around now. She won very easily in the end. My only concern was the ground. For a five-year-old mare she was full of herself and she is a credit to Cheveley Park for keeping her in training\\". Red Bloom ended her career with a trip to Canada for the E. P. Taylor Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack on 22 October. She started favourite but was hampered twice in the straight and finished sixth behind Arravale. Breeding record Red Bloom was retired from racing to become a broodmare for the Cheveley Park Stud. To date (December 2015) she has produced at least seven foals and two winners: *Vasily, a bay colt, foaled in 2008, sired by Sadler's Wells. Won five races. *Unnamed filly, foaled 2009, by Dansili *Unnamed bay colt, foaled 2010, by Duke of Marmalade *Sea The Bloom, bay filly, 2011, by Sea the Stars.

Born in a small settlement in what is now Tolƒçeme≈°, Slovakia, Gi≈àa was introduced to music at a very young age and was considered a prodigy by his village and settlement. An integral part of Romani culture is storytelling and Gi≈àa would base his own stories on scenarios similar. At a relatively young age Gi≈àa and his family moved over 700 kilometres to Rokycany to escape from the war. Gi≈àa developed a passion for the traditional stories and recounts that the elders in his village told him and started documenting them and translating them into Czech to share with his friends. Gi≈àa started a band called 'Rytmus 84' which was extremely popular throughout the city. Gi≈àa started writing after 1976 when his only son was born. Gi≈àa wrote many books and developed his love for literature for more than thirty years. He would write about the traditional subjects for storytelling, including marriage and disappointment. His work has gained him many awards and popularity throughout the Romani clans.  Early life  Gi≈àa was born into poverty in the settlement of Tolƒçeme≈°, in north eastern Slovakia, to Helena and Andrej Gina. His father was a well known musician and a blacksmith and was known throughout his settlement. His mother was a homemaker. Gi≈àa was the youngest child and enjoyed growing up with his brothers and sisters, when he was quite young his family decided to move to the Czech Republic in order to have a better life for themselves and their children, away from poverty and famine. Gi≈àa would frequently recall that his mother would go into the fields after they had been picked and take the rotten potatoes so the children could eat. They moved to Rokycany and lived close to the town centre.  Personal life  Gi≈àa met the love of his life soon after moving to Rokycany. They had five children which included four girls and one boy. They first lived in an apartment very close to the town centre before purchasing a newly built four bedroom house in the 1980s, close to the forest. Gi≈àa was known throughout the region as the man who sold 'Goja' a speciality consisting of a filling of either potatoes, meat or rice encased in pig intestines which were boiled and fried. He also sold potatoes which then made his fortune. This food has been considered to be the national dish of the Romani people. He would spend his evenings with his family or in his office writing stories. He learnt how to be a smelter and worked as a truck driver during the 1970s and 1980s.  Death  Gi≈àa lost his life after a string of health complications, he died of cancer on September 30, 2015, aged 79. His funeral commenced soon after and was surrounded by many people who worked with him. During his last months of life he was rushed to hospital many times after chest pains, stomach and gallbladder pains. He was initially told that he would be able to have an operation that could remove gallstones, that had been lodged for decades, but didn't live to see the day. He remained on a specific diet and was restricted from many of his favourite foods.

The battle was a major Byzantine victory, and one of the rare naval battles that took place during the night in the Middle Ages. In 880, a fleet from the Aghlabid emirate of Ifriqiya sailed against the Byzantine Empire and raided the western coasts of Greece. John Skylitzes reports that it numbered sixty \\"exceedingly large\\" ships, and that it raided the Ionian Islands of Zakynthos and Cephalonia. When news of this raid reached the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, a fleet was dispatched to confront them, headed by the newly appointed droungarios of the Imperial Fleet, Nasar. Thanks to favourable wind, the fleet soon reached the port of Methone on the southern tip of Greece, but there was forced to halt, as many of the fleet's oarsmen had deserted in small groups out of fear of the impending battle. Nasar was therefore forced to tarry at Methone, where he brought his fleet back up to strength from the local troops of the theme of the Peloponnese. In the meantime, Nasar informed Emperor Basil I of the events, and Basil was quickly able to capture the deserters. In order to restore discipline among the rest of the fleet, the Emperor then selected 30 Saracen prisoners of war, had their features obscured by soot, and had them publicly flogged in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, before sending them away, ostensibly to be executed at Methone. The Aghlabid fleet had also learned of the Byzantine fleet's reluctance to engage them, and had grown overconfident. The crews left their ships and pillaged the coasts heedlessly, so that when Nasar arrived with his fleet, they were caught unawares and were annihilated in a night attack. According to the report of Skylitzes, many perished on board their ships when they were set on fire. As the historians John Pryor and Elizabeth Jeffreys write, Nasar's decision to attack at night was an \\"extremely bold\\" one, as darkness \\"made tactical manoeuvring impossible and outcomes unpredictable\\". Consequently, night battles at sea were very rare. Following his victory, Nasar sailed to southern Italy to assist the army operating there under generals Prokopios and Leo Apostyppes. There he raided Sicily and scored another great victory over an Aghlabid fleet at the Battle of Stelai before returning to Constantinople.

The Sikhote-Alin is a range that runs north-south through Primorsky Krai (in English, \\"Maritime Region\\"). The park is designed to protect west-slope river valley habitat, and to support the remnant of the indigenous Udege people. The area is known for abundant fishing and boating on the streams and rivers. It is also a refuge for the endangered Amur tiger. The park is roughly midway between the city of Vladivostok (520 km to the southwest), and Khabarovsk (440 km to the northwest). The relatively warm waters of the Sea of Japan are to the east, the Korean peninsula to the south, and China to the West. Topography Udegeyskaya Legende National Park (upper left), and Sikhote-Alin Zapovednik (lower right) In many ways it is a midpoint park: between the Sikhote-Alin Nature Reserve just east of the ridge and the Amur River basin, between the Zov Tigra National Park / Lazovsky Nature Reserve to the south and Anyuysky National Park and other protected areas to the north. Elevations in the borders range from 180 meters in river lowlands, to 1,330 meters at the mountain crest. The mountain valleys of Udegyskaya Legende feed the Armu River and the Bolshaya Ussurka River, which flow west to the Ussuri River and ultimately the Amur River, which flows north to the Okhotsk Sea. The main river valley of the Ussurka runs to the north- northeast, along the Sikhote-Alin fault, it is passable to small boats in lower region, with oxbow lakes and marshy banks. The river valleys are narrow and winding. Slopes average 10-15 degrees, but are often 15-25 degrees. At the headwaters of streams, rocky outcrops are rare. The banks of the Armu, though, are rocky and steep, with frequent rapids and waterfalls. There are three small settlements in the park: Far Kut, Dersu, and Ostovnoe. Climate and ecoregion The climate of Udegeyskaya Legenda is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. The average temperature is 3.4 degrees (F) in January to 61.4 F in August. Average annual precipitation is 31.1 inches. Autumn in the region is clear, warm, dry and with gradually declining temperatures. This has been called the \\"golden Far East Autumn.\\" Udegeyskaya Legende is in the Ussuri broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregion, which covers a mountainous areas above the lower Amur River and Ussuri River in the Russian Far East. The park is situated in a way that maximizes plant and animal diversity. It is at multiple meeting points: the meeting of continental and maritime zones (Eurasia and the Pacific Ocean) and the meeting of hot and cold-loving species from both temperate and sub-tropic zones. It is also a geological contact region between ancient (Achean-Proterozoic) stable base rocks to the west, and more active tectonic formations to the east in the Sea of Japan. Furthermore, it is on major migration routes of birds and other animals, and has a topography that escaped both recent glaciation and human development. The resulting diversity of habitats and isolation gives the Primorsky region the highest levels of biodiversity in Russia. For aquatic habitat, the park is in the \\"Lower Amur\\" freshwater ecoregion (FEOW ID#616), a region that is characterized in general by stream systems of strongly eroded river valleys and a well-developed floodplain on Amur River. Ice forms on rivers up to 6 months of the year, and most of the streams are rain fed. The freshwater ecoregion contains no strict endemic fishes. Plants Given the steep topography, altitude zones for plants are notable. In the lowlands, deciduous forests with elm, ash and Manchurian walnut, cedar pine and spruce - to higher-level spruce-fir forests with birch. The park records 30 species of vascular plant requiring protection in the area, including Japanese mountain yam, fox nut, Pacific saxifrage, ginseng, and yew. Animals Besides the presence of the Amur tiger, the park is home to brown bears and the Asian black bears, characteristic of the forests of western slope of the Sikhote- Alin. Smaller forest mammals are sable, marten, badger and weasels, along with lynx and leopard cat. The river banks are home to minks and otters, and the lowlands rivers have elk and moose. The area is particularly rich in insects - over 10,000 species are estimated to live in the territory, including a species of longhorn beetle that is believed to be the largest in Russia. History Gabled yurt of a Udege family, early 1920s The region and park boundaries are the historic home of the Udege people. A census in 2010 put the number of Udege at under 1,500.Russian Census 2010: Population by ethnicity They traditionally have a hunting-fishing culture. Tourism Eco-tourism is a stated purpose of the park, and visitors are welcome in the recreational zones. The park administration provides some accommodation in a guest house and campgrounds, and provides for rental of snowmobiles and inflatable rafts. There is a geological museum on the site, and guided tours can be arranged for a fee. Unguided trails are developed, such as an ecological trail that leads to the \\"Kovalevskaya yew grove\\", which features ancient yew trees. The park is in a remote area - the nearest train station is at Dalnerechensk, 144 km from the borders of the park - but its position on the west slope of the Sikhote-Alin makes it more accessible to tourists on the main road to the west.

Established about 1790 and subject to major alterations in the 1860s, it is a well-preserved and little-altered example of a 19th-century New England connected farmstead. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The Sabin Wheat Farm stands on the east side of Westminster Road, about north of Putney village, just north of the road's crossing of Sackett's Brook. The farmstead stands close to the road, on that are surrounded by working agricultural fields. The principal feature of the farmstead is the main house, an Italianate structure at the front of the complex that is one of the town's earliest examples of the style. Extending behind it are a kitchen ell, a long shed, and two attached barns, all built or moved to the site in the early 1860s. The farm was established early in Putney's history, when Noah Sabin purchased the surrounding land and built a house in 1768, probably across the street from the present house. The present house has at its core Sabin's second house, a Federal period structure built c. 1780-90. The farm was owned by Sabins until 1839, when it was sold to a cousin Samuel Wheat, Jr. Wheat, a prosperous farmer, was responsible for the transformation of the 1780s farmstead into the connected complex that we see in largely unaltered form today.

It serves as a resource for young professionals in their growth in medical education and administration. History The society was formed was founded as a nonprofit organization in 2004. The society formally changed its name in February 2006 to the Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH) in an attempt to increase appeal to non-physician healthcare providers. By the end of 2006, membership in the organization was just over 1,500 people. Membership continued to steadily grow to be over 3,000 people by 2012. Annual meeting The first annual International Meeting on Medical Simulation (IMMS) was held in 1995. The SSH has wholly supported the meeting since 2006. In 2007, the IMMS meeting was renamed to become International Meeting for Simulation in Healthcare (IMSH). Simulation in Healthcare Simulation in Healthcare is the journal of the SSH. The journal was first published in January 2006 with Dr. David Gaba as the founding Editor in Chief. The journal is published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. The SSH was envisioned as an umbrella organization and the journal also serves as the official publication for other groups such as the Australian Society for Simulation in Healthcare. The journal is indexed by National Library of Medicine. SSH accreditation In 2010 the SSH Council for Accreditation of Healthcare Simulation Programs began an accreditation process for simulation centers to show that they are performing at the high standards recommended by the organization. In addition to university or hospital based education programs, the Clinical Simulation Program for the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) became the first medical association to become accredited by the SSH in 2013. As of 2015, there have been fifty-four programs in six countries have passed the accreditation process. The SSH has also partnered with groups such as the Association of Standardized Patient Educators (ASPE) in conducting these surveys. Certification The need for a ‚Äúuniform mechanism to educate, evaluate, and certify simulation instructors for the health care profession‚Äù was recognized by McGaghie et al. in their critical review of simulation-based medical education research. In 2012 the SSH piloted two new certifications to provide recognition to educators in an effort to meet this need. By the end of 2012 the final programs were in place. The SSH Certified Healthcare Simulation Educator (CHSE) program was established to provide ‚Äúformal professional recognition of your specialized knowledge, skills, abilities and accomplishments in simulation education.‚Äù The CHSE had been issued to 600 simulationists in 17 countries by 2015. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing cited CHSE as a recommended certification in their 2015 NCSBN Simulation Guidelines for Prelicensure Nursing Programs. The CHSE-A (Advanced) certification was designed to further distinguish simulationists as a ‚Äúsimulation expert and leader in the field‚Äù. The SSH Certified Healthcare Simulation Operations Specialist (CHSOS) program was established to provide ‚Äúan inclusive ‚Äúumbrella‚Äù term that embodies many different roles within healthcare simulation operations, including simulation technician, simulation technology specialist, simulation specialist, simulation coordinator, simulation AV specialist, etc.\\" References  External links  Category:Medical associations based in the United States Category:Medical education in the United States Category:Medical education in Canada Category:Medical simulation Category:Medical and health organizations based in Washington, D.C.

Codman was educated in public schools and later graduated in Law from Harvard University in 1882. Ordained ministry He practiced law for some years however upon the death of his brother, the Reverend Archibald Codman, his thoughts turned to the ordained ministry. He studied in the General Theological Seminary in New York City after which he was ordained deacon in 1893. He was appointed curate of All Saints Church in Ashmont, Boston. In 1894 he was ordained priest by Bishop Charles Chapman Grafton. He became rector of St John's Church in Boston Highlands. Episcopacy Codman was elected to succeed Henry A. Neely as Bishop of Maine.

Among the 500,000 members of such communities in the United States there are only an estimated 1,200 to 1,300 outsiders who have joined them. Who wants to join the Plain Mennonites and Amish? The real seekers of Anabaptist life at Association of Religion Data Archives A major obstacle for seekers is the language, because most Old Order communities speak German dialects like Pennsylvania German or Hutterite German in every day life and in general won't give it up for seekers. Exceptions are the Old Order Mennonites of Virginia, the Old Order Schwarzenau Brethren and the Old Order River Brethren who speak English only.So, You Want To Be Amish? at amishnews.comCan a non-Hutterite join a Hutterite colony at hutterites.org  Types of seekers  Stephen Scott, himself a convert to the Old Order River Brethren, distinguishes four types of seekers: * Checklist seekers, who look for a couple of certain specifications. * Cultural seekers, who are more enchanted with the lifestyle of the Amish than with their religion. * Spiritual utopian seekers, who look for true New Testament Christianity. * Stability seekers, who come with emotional issues, often from dysfunctional families.Donald B.

Waldrep: The New Order Amish And Para- Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition, in Mennonite Quarterly Review 3 (2008), page 416. The \\"Michigan Churches\\", with which Smyrna and Manton affiliated, are said to be more open to seekers and converts than other Amish churches. Most of the members of these two Amish communities originally came from Plain churches, i. e. Old Order Amish, Old Order Mennonite or Old German Baptist Brethren, but others came from non-Amish backgrounds. Another seeker-friendly community in Maine, belonging to the Michigan Churches, is located at Unity, Maine.An Unusual Amish Convert Story In Unity, Maine at amishamerica.com It is stated that there are more people among the \\"Michigan Churches\\" that feel sure to be saved or consider themselves to be born again Christians than among other subgroups of Old Order Amish, a fact that suits seekers. Joe Keim: ‚ÄúAre the Amish Truly Born Again?‚Äù In accordance to that, G. C. Waldrep stated that the Michigan Churches show many spiritual and material similarities to the New Orders, while they are still technically considered a part of the larger Old Order group.G.C. Waldrep: \\"The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition.\\" in Mennonite Quarterly Review 3 (2008), page 426. More people have tested Amish life for weeks, months or even years but in the end decided not to join. Others remain just close to the Amish and never thought of joining.Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt: The Amish, Baltimore 2013, page 159. Seekers among the Old Order Mennonites There have been only very few seekers among the different groups of Old Order Mennonites, with one exception: the Noah Hoover Mennonites, who resemble the Amish in most outward aspects of life, like dress and the use of technology. Besides Standard German for Church and Bible reading, and Pennsylvania German in everyday life, English is also used in Church and among some members, most of them seekers, who have joined the Noah Hoovers, but without a general tendency of shifting to English. Stephan Scott writes: Contrary to popular belief Old Order groups do not simply stay as they always have been, but have to struggle in many ways to adapt to the modern world and to preserve traditions, that are important to them. Because the Noah Hoover Mennonites have such a complicated history of splits and mergers, they are unable to rely on tradition in the same way other conservative groups like e. g. the Swartzentruber Amish do, so they have had to find out in a longer process how they wish to live. This led to a community, that is more intentionalist-minded than ultra-traditional.Joseph Donnermeyer and Cory Anderson: The Growth of Amish and Plain Anabaptists in Kentucky, in Journal of Amish and Plain Anabaptist Studies 2(2):215, page 232.\\" Seekers among the Hutterites Since the 17th century Hutterites in general have not engaged in active mission efforts. In customary Old Order fashion they see their role as model for Christian seekers, according to : :In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.The Holy Bible: English Standard Version, Standard Bible Society, 2001, Mt 5:16 They do not expect many people to join them. In general the more traditional Hutterites are, the less interested they are in evangelism. The Schmiedeleut 1 are more open to seekers than the other leut. In 1972 the Dariusleut were joined by a group in Japan, the Owa Hutterite Colony.Lehr, John C.: Owa: a Dariusleut Hutterite colony in Japan in Prairie Perspectives: Geographical Essays (Vol: 13), Winnipeg 2010, pages 30-32 In the 1990s the Schmiedeleut 1 and the Bruderhof Communities helped a group in Palmgrove, Nigeria to establish communal living, but the soon this affiliation failed.Rod Janzen and Max Stanton: The Hutterites in North America, page 106. The Elmendorf Christian Community, an independent community of Hutterite tradition, that separated from the Schmiedeleut in 2005, is even more open to seekers than the Schmiedeleut 1. The same is true for the four other Hutterite Christian Communities.Elmendorf Christian Community: What We Believe and How We Live Seekers among the Old Order Schwarzenau Brethren There are five groups among the Schwarzenau Brethren which can be described as Old Order. These groups are the Old German Baptist Brethren, the Old Brethren, the Old Order German Baptist Brethren, the Old Brethren German Baptist and the Old German Baptist Brethren, New Conference. They range from horse and buggy groups to Plain dressing groups with few restrictions on technology (mainly television and internet). Since they all have lost the German language and their German ethnic identity in the late 19th century, the cultural gap between these groups and the mainstream society is much smaller than in groups that have preserved their German heritage. They are all influenced by Pietism which brings their theology closer to the Protestant mainstream of the Great Awakenings. All these groups are quite open for outsiders and the larger ones of these groups do not consist largely of members with German roots anymore. The same is true for the Old Order River Brethren, who have prominent personalities from outside who joined them, like Stephen Scott and G. C. Waldrep. The Christian Communities of Elmo Stoll Elmo Stoll, a former Old Order Amish bishop, founded the \\"Christian Communities\\" in 1990 to help seekers to join a Plain, horse-and-buggy, English-speaking community rooted in Anabaptism. Stoll died early in 1998 and the five \\"Christian Communities\\" he and his followers had established soon broke apart, one joining the Old Order Amish of the ‚ÄùMichigan Churches‚Äù affiliation and two joining the Noah Hoover Old Order Mennonites .Richard A. Pride: Elmo Stoll and the Christian Community at Cookeville in Border States: Journal of the Kentucky Tennessee American Studies Association, Volume 14 : 2003, page 48 A community in Kentucky of some 15 families, the Caneyville Christian Community, founded in 2004 by three men, among them one of Elmo Stoll's sons, still adheres to Elmo Stoll's vision. Both Elmo Stoll's Christian Communities and Caneyville Christian Community are classified as \\"para-Amish\\".Donnermeyer, Joseph, and Cory Anderson: The Growth of Amish and Plain Anabaptists in Kentucky, in Journal of Amish and Plain Anabaptist Studies 2(2):215, page 231, 2014.Kevin Williams, Lovina Eicher: Amish Cooks Across America: Recipes and Traditions from Maine to Montana, Kansas City 2013, page 145.G.C.

Seekers among para-Amish groups Since the 1960s groups similar to the Amish, called \\"para-Amish\\" by G. C. Waldrep, have arisen to embody their own vision of spiritual renewal in a framework similar to Old Order groups. These groups use horse-and-buggy and have restriction on technology comparable to other Old Order groups. These groups have attracted many spiritual seekers.G. C. Waldrep: \\"The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition.\\" in Mennonite Quarterly Review 3 (2008), page 423/4. Notable \\"para-Amish\\" groups are: * The Believers in Christ at Lobelville, Tennessee, established in 1973 and still in existence.G. C.

It has been described as the \\"most beautiful musical work ever written about the Holocaust\\", and as \\"an exquisite, haunting and passionate melody that moves Kambanellis' affecting words to an even higher level\\". In May 1988, the world premiere of the \\"Trilogy\\" at the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria was attended by then Austrian chancellor Franz Vranitzky and tens of thousands of Europeans. The ballad was conducted by Theodorakis and sung by Maria Farandouri in Greek, Elinor Moav in Hebrew and Gisela May in German. In May 1995, Theodorakis conducted a repeat concert of the ballad at the camp to mark the 50th anniversary of its liberation from the Nazis. Before the concert Simon Wiesenthal made a speech, which was included in the Mauthausen Trilogy CD. The Mauthausen Cycle is one of the best known compositions inspired by events at the Mauthausen concentration camp, it is popular in Israel, and has been used to promote peace and cooperation worldwide. In 1991, the Philharmonic Orchestra of Israel conducted by Zubin Mehta performed the work as part of the Athens Festival. The ballad reflects Kambanellis's own experience at Mauthausen, including his love for a Lithuanian-Jewish woman, as it recounts the love affair between a young Greek prisoner and his Jewish love amidst the atrocities they witnessed at the camp. Approximately a year after the release of his ballad, during the premiere of the Mauthausen song cycle in London in 1967, Mikis Theodorakis was imprisoned in Greece by the recently installed Greek military junta and his music was banned in the country. Historical background In World War II, Iakovos Kambanellis, a Greek author and poet, was imprisoned by the Nazis at the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria where he witnessed the Nazi atrocities. Over 100,000 victims died at the camp. Kambanellis survived the incarceration at the Nazi concentration camp and, after the liberation by the Allies, started writing a book based on the events and atrocities he witnessed there. With the passing years, Kambanellis's work remained in manuscript form at his home. Subsequent world events, such as the assassination of US President Kennedy, caused Kambanellis to re-examine and update his manuscript. He then wrote two new chapters, which were eventually published in the Sunday editions of the Greek newspaper Eleftheria and caused a sensation. In December 1965, Kambanellis published his book Mauthausen with the Themelio publishers in Athens. Inception and theme While the book was being prepared for publication by Themelio, Kambanellis wrote four poems based on four chapters in his book. The poems recounted the love affair between two young prisoners at the camp. The owner of Themelio publications, Mimis Despotides, suggested to Kambanellis that the four poems should also be released as songs, to coincide with the publication of the book, and suggested Mikis Theodorakis as the composer. Kambanellis agreed and gave the poems to his friend Mikis Theodorakis who was very receptive to the idea of composing the music for them, since he was also imprisoned by the Nazis and Italian fascists in Greece during the war, and created the \\"Mauthausen Trilogy\\" which was quite unlike any of his previous works. The premiere of the works in Greece was at a theatre in Hippocrates street in Athens in December 1965 and the reception by the audience was enthusiastic. Structure US 11th Armored Division entering the Mauthausen concentration camp in 1945 The title of the songs is \\"The Ballad of Mauthausen\\" and contained four arias: \\"ŒÜœÉŒºŒ± Œ±œÉŒºŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ [Asma Asmaton]\\" (Song of Songs) with verses inspired to a degree by erotic lyrics from the biblical Song of Songs, and includes the lyrics Œ§Œπ œâœÅŒ±ŒØŒ± œÄŒøœÖ ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ Œ∑ Œ±Œ≥Œ¨œÄŒ∑ ŒºŒøœÖ [Ti oraia pou einai i agapi mou] (How beautiful is my beloved). The second song was \\"ŒëŒΩœÑœéŒΩŒ∑œÇ [Antonis]\\" (Anthony), followed by \\"ŒîœÅŒ±œÄŒ≠œÑŒ∑œÇ [Drapetis]\\" (Runaway) and \\"ŒåœÑŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒµŒªŒµŒπœéœÉŒ∑ Œø œÄœåŒªŒµŒºŒøœÇ] Otan Teleiosi o Polemos\\" (When the War Ends). The composition is a music cycle. In \\"Asma Asmaton\\" the struggle of the young male prisoner is depicted as he is trying hopelessly to locate his love. It reflects Kambanellis's own experience at Mauthasen with a Lithuanian-Jewish woman, as it recounts the love affair between a young Greek prisoner and his Jewish love. Kambanellis uses a question from the biblical \\"Song of Songs\\" 3:3: \\"Have you seen the one I love?\\" as the refrain for his lyrics. In the lyrics, the hero is asking the girls of the concentration camps if they saw the girl he loves: \\"Girls of Auschwitz, girls of Dachau, have you seen the one I love?\\" and the reply is: \\"We saw her on a long journey. She no longer had her dress nor the little comb in her hair\\". He then asks again: \\"Girls of Mauthausen, girls of Belsen, have you seen the one I love? and gets the reply: \\"We saw her in the frozen square with a number in her white hand, with a yellow star on her heart\\". In \\"Antonis\\", the suffering of the imprisoned Jews doing hard labour, at the Mauthausen quarries is told, \\"mixed with a revolutionary and subversive mood\\". Antonis is a Greek prisoner who tries to help his Jewish friend carry a heavy boulder up an incline of 180 steps after his friend cannot work any longer and asks Antonis to help him. The boulders are used to pave the streets of Vienna. The lyrics state: \\"help is an insult. compassion a curse\\", indicating that helping another inmate is severely punished by the Nazi guards. However, Antonis helps his friend without hesitation. A Nazi guard intervenes and, to punish Antonis, instructs him to carry a boulder twice as heavy. Antonis then chooses an even heavier boulder than the one the Nazi guard showed him and carries it to the top instead. Antonis states his name in Greek: \\"ŒúŒ≠ŒΩŒ± ŒºŒµ ŒªŒ≠ŒΩŒµ ŒëŒΩœÑœéŒΩŒ∑, Œ∫Œπ' Œ±ŒΩ ŒµŒØœÉŒ±Œπ Œ¨ŒΩœÑœÅŒ±œÇ Œ≠ŒªŒ± Œ¥œâ œÉœÑŒø ŒºŒ±œÅŒºŒ±œÅŒ≠ŒΩŒπŒø Œ±ŒªœéŒΩŒπ\\" (\\"My name is Antonis, and if you are a man come here on the marble threshing floor\\"), challenging the guard and implying that real men are fighting for their lives in the Nazi quarry. The image of the marble threshing-floor is common in Greek folk literature, deriving from the Akritic songs, where the eponymous hero, Digenis Akritas, \\"as a kind of representative of mankind's struggles with Charos, death, at the marble threshing-floor\\". In \\"Drapetis\\", the adventure of an escapee, \\"Yannos Ber from The North\\", is narrated through the song, as is also his recapture by the SS which leads to his \\"tragic fate\\". The finale \\"Otan Teleiosi o Polemos\\" is a fantasy about the reunion of the two lovers. It goes full circle with the girl from \\"Song of Songs\\" appearing as \\"the girl with the fearful eyes\\" and \\"the girl with the frozen hand\\", and shows the protagonist of the first part, \\"Asma Asmaton\\", seeking love everywhere inside the concentration camp as a means of erasing Death, singing the words: \\"ŒàœÅœâœÑŒ± ŒºŒµœÉ' œÉœÑŒø ŒºŒµœÉŒ∑ŒºŒ≠œÅŒπ œÉ' œåŒªŒ± œÑŒ± ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ¨œÑŒøœÖ œéœÉœÄŒøœÖ ŒΩ' Œ±œÜŒ±ŒΩŒπœÉœÑŒµŒØ Œ∑ œÉŒ∫ŒπŒ¨ œÑŒøœÖ\\" (Make love at midday, in all of Death's places until his Shadow disappears\\". Reception The ballad is considered as possibly the greatest work of Theodorakis, while the \\"Song of Songs\\" has been described as \\"one of the finest songs Theodorakis has ever written\\". The music critic of the Baltimore Sun writes: \\"Theodorakis had the genius to set this poem with melodic elements from the hymn for Palm Sunday of the Orthodox Church, creating an exquisite, haunting and passionate melody that moves Kambanellis' affecting words to an even higher level.\\" Jerry Silverman in his book The Undying Flame: Ballads and Songs of the Holocaust writes that \\"we can be [similarly] enthralled by the passionate lyrics and haunting melody of \\"Asma Asmaton\\"\\" and \\"[Kambanellis] also wote a cycle of four poems based on episodes in his book, which were lovingly set to music by Mikis Theodorakis\\". Silverman also calls \\"Asma Asmaton\\" \\"extraordinarily moving\\". Sophia Richman in her book Mended by the Muse: Creative Transformations of Trauma writes: \\"The song cycle is a requiem for Holocaust victims and raised the consciousness of all Greeks. Its sublime melodic lines, extended harmonies and rhythms, forced listeners to ask, \\"What happened to our Jews?\\"\\". Richman also mentions that the composer \\"created songs that have entered the pantheon of acclaimed song cycles\\". Ya æir Oron in the book The Pain Of Knowledge: Holocaust And Genocide Issues In Education writes that Kambanellis's poem \\"Song of Songs\\" \\"touches on certain aspects of the attitude of the world to the victims of the Holocaust in a unique way\\". Oron further comments that \\"Through its delicate poetical phrasing and its allusions to the biblical \\"Song of Songs\\" (Song of Solomon), the reader's attention is drawn to seemingly trivial details rather than to abstract generalizations. In this way, the poem evokes a personal identification with a specific figure (a young Jewish girl in this case).\\" Oron concludes that these attributes of the poem will make the pupil interested in the poem itself as well as the greater historical context surrounding the events depicted in the lyrics. Kambanellis's poem \\"Song of Songs\\" has been included in a 7th Grade reader which is approved for the new middle schools' literature curriculum in Israel. The work has been described as a \\"classical piece\\", and as \\"one that contrasts the Nazi horror with the only possible joy, the joy of resistance\\". During the premiere of his ballad in London in 1967, Mikis Theodorakis was in Greece imprisoned by the recently installed Greek military junta and his music was banned in the country. On 6 May 1994 at a concert in Carnegie Hall, filled to capacity, the audience joined Farandouri in singing the ballad. There are editions of these songs in Hebrew and several other languages. Already in 1967, on Theodorakis' request, Liesbeth List sung the Mauthausen cycle in Dutch in ', which became a platinum disc. World premiere and anniversaries In May 1988, the world premiere of the \\"Mauthausen Trilogy\\", described as a \\"landmark concert\\", took place with Mikis Theodorakis conducting at the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria. The concert was attended by Austrian chancellor Franz Vranitzky along with tens of thousands of people from across Europe. Iakovos Kambanellis was also present. The ballad was sung by Maria Farandouri in Greek, Elinoar Moav Veniadi in Hebrew, Nadia Weinberg in English, and by East-German singer Gisela May in German. In May 1995, a repeat concert at Mauthausen camp took place to mark the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the camp conducted again by Theodorakis, which was also attended by chancellor Vranitzky and Simon Wiesenthal, who held a speech during the event. Maria Farandouri was the performer of the songs at that concert as well. On 10 May 2015, the ballad of Theodorakis was played in a ceremony at the Greek memorial of Mauthausen honouring the memory of the 3,700 Greek victims of the Holocaust with Zoe Konstantopoulou attending as speaker of the Hellenic Parliament on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the camp. Delegations from other European states and thousands of Europeans also attended ceremonies at the memorials of their individual countries. In October 2015 the municipality of Larissa in Greece included the performance of Theodorakis's ballad as part of a five-day celebration commemorating the liberation of the city from the Nazi occupation. Wider impact The song \\"Antonis\\" from the ballad has been used by the Kurds as musical background in a video showing Kurdish women fighting at Koban√Æ during the Syrian Civil War. The song was also sung by the residents of Kabul in 2001 as they greeted troops of the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan entering the city and expelling the Taliban. The aria of \\"Antonis\\" was the music theme of Costa-Gavras's 1969 film Z, whose soundtrack won a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music in 1970. \\"Antonis\\" was also chosen as the background music for a pre-election advertising spot of Syriza, a fact criticised by the newspapers because the name \\"Antonis\\" was that of the New Democracy leader at the time, Antonis Samaras, and the lyrics depict Antonis as a heroic figure who challenges anyone to fight with him on the marble threshing-floor. The title of one newspaper article translates as: \\"[Elena] Akrita: Did anyone at Syriza pay attention to the lyrics of the piece they chose for their [advertising] spot?\\" and the other: \\"Unfortunate selection of music in Syriza's [advertising] spot\\". Theatrical play A theatrical play based on the Trilogy premiered in Athens on 6 December 2012 featuring the music of Mikis Theodorakis and Gustav Mahler. The work appeared at the Badminton Theater in Athens under the title Mauthausen. Theodorakis had granted permission for the use of his work during the play.

The Centre was designed to be a unique and innovative experiment to improve the well-being of Canada's poorest demographic group. The Air Force base provided a 2,500-acre site and the Centre had a maximum population of 3,000 people. It included an industrial park with four industries, a day care centre, a school, a recreation program and counseling services.Oo-za-we-kwun Centre. Brochure, c 1976. The Centre opened in 1971 and was closed in 1980 when the then Department of Indian Affairs removed its funding. The land had some continued military use until 1982 when Federal Government then offered the base for sale to the public.  Background  The concept was first developed by Frank E. Price (1931-2015) in the proposal, Rivers Training Centre: A Social Change Program for Indian People. The identified needs of First Nations people included lack of training and saleable skills, and the inability to relate to an urban environment. Crucially, the report does not indicate how these needs were determined (see Evaluation section). The stated purpose of the Oo-za-we- kwun Centre was to \\"provide technical training facilities to Indians so they may find better employment\\".F. E. Price (1971). Rivers Training Centre: A Social Change Program for Indian People. Treasury Board of Canada, file 501/4-1 Its objective was to provide \\"Canadian Natives with training, employment and a future ... bringing together different cultures into a closely-knit community environment.\\" Oo-za-we-kwun Centre. Brochure, c 1976. According to its own publicity, the Centre was \\"designed to help Native People participate more effectively in a modern Canadian environment. The residential family program includes a five-week Life Skills course followed by a two-year transfer of learning period during which counselling, paid employment, and community activities are available.\\" Oo-za-we-kwun Centre. Brochure, c 1976. The Centre was named after Oo-za-we-kwun (O-zah-wah-sko-gwan-na-be or Yellow Quill), c1840-1910, chief of the then Portage Band of the Plains Ojibway. He was signatory of the 1871 Treaty One between Canada and the First Nations. The Oo-za-we-kwun Centre was initially funded by the federal government department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, the Manitoba Government and the Manitoba Indian Brotherhood although the latter two pulled out during the life of the Centre.  Saskatchewan New Start Life Skills Program  The main intervention program was controversial. It was based on a model known as Saskatchewan New Start Life Skills. Life Skills training is an intervention approach to develop problem solving behaviours appropriately and responsibly used in the management of personal affairs\\". The model has been found to be robust and is used in a 31 sites in Canada ( ) and dozens more in Africa. Although subject to harsh criticism at the time (see below), the model has since been well validated.  Industries  There were four factories on the site: Edson Industries, Arnold Manufacturing, Tim-Br-Fab Industries and Sekine Cycle. These industries were required to hire at least 25% First Nations employees, supplying a practical work experience aspect to the program. = Sekine Cycle = Sekine was a Japanese bicycle manufacturer founded in 1912. The company opened a plant at the Centre in 1973. It employed 100 people, about 80% First Nations supervised by Japanese engineers and had an annual output of as many as 50,000 bicycles. After the Centre closed, so did Sekine‚Äôs Canadian operations. In January 1982, it went into receivership and its assets were sold. = Edson Industries = Edson was truck camper and trailer manufacturer that moved from Neepawa, Manitoba, to benefit from the subsidies provided. It employed 80 people and went bankrupt in 1983. = Arnold Manufacturing = Arnold produced vinyl furniture, which then evolved into fiberglass seating, as it was sturdy and vandal-proof, for restaurants such as McDonald's. After closure, they moved to Windsor, Ontario. The company was involuntarily dissolved in 1988.http://www.companies-florida.com/arnold- manufacturing-ltd-corporation-9nj6/ = Tim-Br-Fab Industries = Tim-Bd-Fab produced pre-fabricated home packages. They were sold across Western Canada. The company survived. It is now located in Oak Bluff, Manitoba. It retains essentially the same business model.http://www.timbrfab.com  Participants and employees  Over 10,000 people took part in the Oo-za-we-kwun program. A number of important Canadian Indigenous leaders worked or trained there: * Ernie Daniels, chief of Long Plain First Nation (1978-1984) and Vice-chief of the Assembly of First Nations * Eli Taylor, chief of Sioux Valley Dakota Nation, elder * Alan Pratt, elder, Sioux Valley Dakota Nation * Norman Fleury, professor Brandon University, elder, Metis National Council. * Margaret Smith Lavall√©e, Elder in Residence, University of Manitoba. * Jules Lavall√©e, Elder in Residence, Red River College. * Violet Daniels, elder, Peguis First Nation * John Hicks, Churchill, Manitoba, Chairperson, Atuqtuarvik Corporation * Ken Courchene Jr., Chief, Sagkeeng First Nation. There is an active \\"alumni\\", composed largely of children who were brought up at the Centre. (https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=oo-za-wakwun ).  Evaluations  The Centre was the subject of five evaluations and two television programs. They all had diametrically opposed conclusions. On one hand, the program was seen as innovative and successful; on the other hand, it was seen as a failure, and effort to \\"teach Indians to flush toilets\\"Manitoba Indian Brotherhood, May, 1976 and an \\"apple factory\\" (i.e. an intervention meant to turn Indigenous people into White people).Manitoba Indian Brotherhood, May, 1976 Haig Report (1975) This report investigated if the objectives and methods of the Centre were consistent with the expressed needs and desires of the Manitoba First Nations People. Conclusion I: To achieve the objectives, the larger society needs to recognize treaty obligations, develop local control and create economic opportunities. Conclusion II: Band Councils hold the key to reducing the tendency for graduates to leave the community. Conclusion III: Increase the provision of extension-type courses such as band development, on-the-job practicums for band staff and training for Department of Indian Affairs [today, Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada] staff in working with band staff. The Haig Report found that a frequent reason for abandoning the program was participants had expected vocational training that was not provided at the Centre. R. P. Muzychuk, An Evaluation of the Oo-za-we- kwun Centre Life Skills Course. Using pre- and post-tests, this report concluded that the Oo-za-we-kwum Life Skills program produced few positive results (six out of 44 measures). Dunning Report (1977) R. W. Dunning was an eminent anthropologist from the University of Manitoba. In conclusion, he wrote, \\"What escapes my understanding is why the Indian Affairs Department has allowed this costly mistake to run its course for five full years. ... What a price to pay for this phantasy of professional planning and development.\\" A hand-written footnote from Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada copy, presumably written by a staff member: \\"Hardly objective statements - though ideologically neat. But he poses no data to support his conclusion!!\\" Recommendation I: Cease and abandon the Life Skills Programme forthwith. Recommendation II: Build up specific technical training. Retain the Basic Management Training Course and expand its concept. Recommendation III: Some hangars (if physically practicable) might be relocated to Indian reserve communities. Recommendation IV: Permit industries which (sic) wish to remain at the Centre to do so. (Note from the previous section, that this was unrealistic.) Recommendation V: Housing should remain in use (see photo). Recommendation VI: There should be Indian management. Canadian Institute for Research Report (1978) The objective of this evaluation was to study the Social Programs Unit, i.e. the Life Skills provider. \\"The general conclusion produced by the study was that the program has been of sufficient merit to warrant its continuation for at least another three to five years. It was found that the rationale for the program has considerable merit and that it is widely supported by many respondents. ... Problems in the implementation of the program have prevented the full range of potential benefits from being realized. ... If such cooperation (of the three funding bodies) is not forthcoming, the Centre's program should be discontinued in its present form.\\" The Band Management program was strongly supported. A major observed outcome was that participants, on returning home, tended to undertake additional training. Post Oo-za-we-kwun Interviews This follow-up study after the Centre closed reported on the views of 26 families that had attended Oo-za-we-kwun programs. 65% had taken further training, 23% were unemployed, 73% had had no involvement with the law, 58% had perceived improved health, 62% had recommended the program to others, and 77% felt the program had given them positive changes.  Legacy  An entrepreneur presently owns the base, utilizing some of the buildings for agricultural purposes. The site had a successful hog farm, Hangar Farms (CJTCR), Ltd. It now lies inactive. Perhaps the most important legacy is the personal and professional success of the children whose parents were participants or employees at the Centre. A documentary on Sekine, containing old photos of the Centre is being prepared by Derek Eidse. R√©sum√© So why did a successful social experiment eventually fail? # It was based on a faulty premise, one of colonialism and assimilation, i.e. training rural Native People in a semi-rural setting to be able to adjust to living in the city. First Nations people and communities were able to work around this defect and make good use of the facilities. They would send people to the Centre who would develop skills and return to make better communities back home. Alternatively, they would send the most troubled family in the village to benefit from two years of high-quality help. # There was substantial in-fighting among Manitoba chiefs who wanted the Centre to move to their community. This would be unlikely to happen with the national and provincial First Nations governance models of today. # The Centre came with a liberal or neo-liberal government and it fit their world view at the time. Ten years later, the governments were conservative in values social programs were seen as unsavoury. This was the same experience as the MINCOME experiment in Dauphin, Manitoba. It came into being under the social democrat government of Ed Shreyer, and died under the conservative government of Sterling Lyon.

Its fruit bodies have striped red and white caps. It is found in Mexico, Central America, and South America, where it grows on twigs. Taxonomy Marasmius tageticolor was first described scientifically by English mycologist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1856, from collections made in Brazil. He noted \\"Nothing can be conceived more exquisite than the colouring of this species, which is pretty common. It has the rich tints of the African Marigold.\\" In 1898, Otto Kuntze proposed transferring the fungus to Chamaeceras, a genus that has since been folded into synonymy with Marasmius. M. tageticolor is classified in section Sicci, subsection Siccini, series Leonini of the genus Marasmius. Description The smooth, convex cap is in diameter. Its surface colouration features alternating radial rays of red and light buff. The gills are distantly spaced, with about 8‚Äì10 gills per fruit body. Red on the upper half near the cap and white on the lower half, they are free from attachment to the stipe. There are short gills (lamellulae) interspersed between some, but not all, of the long gills. The smooth stipe measures long by 1 mm wide, and has a beet red to dull brown colour. There is buff-coloured cottony mycelium at the stipe base. Spores of Marasmius tageticolor measure 17‚Äì19 by 3.5‚Äì4 Œºm. They are smooth, thin-walled, and inamyloid. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and hyaline (translucent), with dimensions of 26‚Äì30 by 7‚Äì8 Œºm. Habitat and distribution The fungus grows on small twigs and stipules. It has been recorded from Mexico, Central America, and South America.

The Dreamers is a fantasy epic saga written by David Eddings. Gods There are eight Gods in the Land of Drahll. Four sleep while the other work for 25 eons, then the cycle ends, and they switch places. Each God, when awake, holds power over one of the Four Domains: North, South, East, and West. =Ara= Ara is something beyond the Elder Gods and Dreamers. She is the wife of Omago. She has much more power than the other gods and the Dreamers seem to have a deep connection with them. The Gods call her 'Mother', although only the Younger Gods know that she is Ara. In \\"The Treasured One\\", she communicates with Longbow, warning him and the other warriors to get out of the way for the Church Armies of the Trogite Empire that she is controlling. She stays in constant touch with the Dreamers, and in the wars of the North and South, she plays a huge role in the victories over the Vlagh. Everyone refers to her as the 'Unknown Friend'. Trenicia realizes that Ara is Unknown Friend, but is advised to keep it a secret. =Elder Gods= :Dalhaine - The Elder God of the North. He was the one who woke the younger gods early, without telling his siblings, and attempted to erase their knowledge of who they were. His Domain is attacked in Crystal Gorge. He lives in a cave on Mt. Shrak with his Dreamer, Ashad (Dakas). He hires an army of horse warriors from the Land of Malavi. :Aracia - The former Elder God of the East. She lives in a temple in East Drahll with her Dreamer Lillabeth (Enalla) and many servants who keep telling her how beautiful she is. Her Domain is attacked in The Younger Gods. She hired an army of warrior women from the Isle of Akalla.Later obliterates herself in a desperate attempt to keep her power from Lillabeth. :Zelana - The Elder God of the West. She hid away in a grotto cave on the Isle of Thurn many eons before (she claims a dozen or so) because she was offended by the behaviour of her people. The war drew her and her Dreamer Eleria (Balacenia) out of their home. She hired an army of Maags to fight in the war. Her Domain is attacked in The Elder Gods. :Veltan - The Elder God of the South. Other than Aracia, he is the only god who frequently visits the people of his Domain, or at least, communicates with them. He lives in a house he made out of only one stone, with his Dreamer Yaltar (Vash). A nearby farmer, Omago, and his wife, Ara, often take care of Yaltar, and everyone in the South of Drahll usually passes information to Veltan through Omago, as they are good friends. His Domain is attacked in \\"The Treasured One\\". Like Dalhaine, he has tamed a thunderbolt to ride around on, which comes in handy during the war, particularly in the ravine before the eruption of Yaltar's volcanoes. His thunderbolt is not as well-tamed as Dalhaine's, though, and often showers him with assorted profanities. =Younger Gods= The Younger Gods were not supposed to wake up as early as they did, before the end of the Elder Gods' cycle. But Dalhaine felt that they would be of help during the upcoming war against the Vlagh. They were reawoken as the Dreamers, originally with no memory of their past lives. But they begin to break through the mental barrier, starting with Balacenia, and realize who they are, but decide to keep it a secret. :Dakas/Ashad - Younger God of the North. Ashad was the Dreamer who predicted, in The Treasured One, that the next attack would be on Veltan's Domain, and warned them of a second army coming up from behind. When Dalhaine first brought the Younger Gods back as the Dreamers, he turned to a mother bear named Mama Broken-Tooth to feed him. His \\"Dream Stone\\" is rare black agate, which he found in Mama Broken-Tooth's cave. :Enalla/Lillabeth - Younger God of the East. Lillabeth is Aracia's Dreamer, and her 'Dream Stone' is an abalone seashell. She, like Eleria, has the tendency to call Rabbit 'Bunny'. :Balacenia/Eleria - Younger God of the West. Eleria is Zelana's Dreamer, the first to have one of the special dreams. She tends to be a very sweet little child, and some people tend to pick up her childish phrases, such as 'Kiss-kiss' and 'Teenie-weenie'. Her 'Dream Stone' is a large pink pearl the size of an apple. :Vash/Yaltar - Younger God of the South. Yaltar is Veltan's Dreamer. His 'Dream Stone' is a fire opal. His first dream pinpointed the exact location of the first attack, in the ravine near Lattash. Maags The Land of Maag lies to the west of Dhrall. Its inhabitants tend to be rather rowdy, and most make their living as pirates. :Captain Sorgan Hook-Beak - Captain of the Seagull. Zelana placed him in charge of all the Maag armies she hired for the war. Eleria teases him by calling him \\"Hook-Big\\". His two cousins, Skell and Torl, have command over other parts of his fleet, but he still in charge of the entire fleet. :Rabbit - Smithy on the Seagull. Many thought he was dim-witted, but he actually hid his cleverness to avoid being set difficult tasks. He discovered he could tell the position of the ship by the stars in the sky, and is the only one who knows that the Seagull is farther away from the Land of Maag than everyone else thinks. Eleria and Lillabeth call him \\"Bunny\\", and in return, he calls her \\"Baby Sister\\". He, Keselo, and Longbow are good friends. One of the first outlanders to learn the secret of the Dreamers, the other being Keselo. :Skell - Sorgan's elder cousin. Led the advance fleet of Maags to Lattash. :Ox - Sorgan's first mate. Described by Rabbit as having 'muscles on top of muscles from his head to his toenails'. : Kryda Ham-Hand - Sorgan's second mate. Named after his meaty hands. :Kaldo Tree-top - Crow's nest crewman on the Seagull. Tallest Maag, noted to be 'well over seven feet tall' in \\"The Elder Gods\\". :Hammer - Smith on The Shark. Was skeptical about Longbow's archery skills, so he had to walk around half a mile down the beach with a clamshell, only to have Longbow shatter it with an arrow, to get proof. :Kajak - Maag ship captain. Rallied his four cousins in \\"The Elder Gods\\" to attack the Seagull in the Maag port of Kweta, and steal the hundred blocks of gold on board. He was thwarted when Eleria had a dream warning them of the attack. She and Zelana informed Longbow, who enlisted Rabbit's help. Kajak was killed by one of Longbow's arrows, while screaming at his men to stop running away. Trogites The Trogite Empire lies south of Dhrall, and its inhabitants are slightly more civilized than those of Maag. :Commander Narasan - Commander of the Trogite army hired by Veltan to fight in the War of Dhrall. He threw away his uniform when his nephew Astal was killed in battle, and only returned to his military career when Veltan approached him with his offer. Until then, Keselo was often sent to try to persuade him. :Keselo - Junior officer in Narasan's army. Described as being more clever than most of the senior officers, and known for spoiling good, long arguments by coming up with simple compromises. Has developed a friendship with Rabbit, Red-Beard, and Longbow, as well as Omago. One of the first outlanders to learn of the gods' secrets. :Gunda - He is a 'first-rate' fort builder and thinks everything is about twice as big, as written in the first book, \\"The Elder Gods\\". He is Narasan's childhood friend, along with Padan. :Andar - A Subcommander in Narasan's army. He terrorizes Holy Takal Bersla of Aracia's Temple, with the threat of 'cannibalism', when Bersla doesn't believe that Aracia's domain is in any harm from the Vlagh's bugs. :Padan - Narasan's childhood friend. He pretends to be a Maag in the fourth book, \\"The Younger Gods\\" Dhralls =Zelana's/Balacenia's Domain (WEST)= :Longbow - A member of Chief Old- Bear's tribe, he is described as \\"A tall man with long blond braids and wearing leather clothing, quite lean, with a hard face.\\" He is extremely skilled with a bow, never missing a target. He hates the Vlagh with such a passion that he dedicated more than half his life to kill it and the Bug People. It is later revealed that a mutated bug, from the Vlagh, had killed Misty-Water (Longbow's Bride), on the day of Longbow's wedding. :Red-beard - Reluctant Chieftain of (new) Lattash, after the first Lattash was destroyed by Yaltar's (Vash) lava, from the twin volcanoes he made erupt to kill the Bug People (The previous chief, White-Braid, was distraught, and sank into depression). He has a whole section of the third book, \\"Crystal Gorge\\" dedicated to him, aptly titled \\"The Reluctant Chieftain\\". =Veltan's/Vash's Domain (SOUTH)= :Omago - Ara's husband Omago. He received education from Veltan when he was younger. In the last book, he is revealed to be \\"Eternal Omago\\" the father of the 8 Gods Of Dhrall :Ara - Omago's wife. She first saw Omago when she was sixteen, quite bluntly saying \\"My name is Ara. I'm sixteen years old and I want you!\\". She is the Treasured One, Longbow's 'unknown friend', and The Mother of The 8 Gods of Dhrall =Dahlaine's/Dakas' Domain (NORTH)= Athlan, Tlantar Two-Hands and the different \\"Nations\\" set up by Elder God Dahlaine of the North =Aracia's/Enalla's Domain (EAST)= None. The Maags and Trogites did the work, the priests were ordered to assist them, but they complained quite loudly. =Others= :Queen Trenicia- Warrior Queen of the isle Akalla. Most men appear inferior to her, but she falls in love with Narasan, leader of the trogite army.

The history of Madeira begins with the discovery of the islands by Portugal in 1419. Madeira is presently officially the Autonomous Region of Madeira (Regi√£o Aut√≥noma da Madeira), and is one of the two autonomous regions of Portugal (along with the Azores). It is an archipelago situated in the north Atlantic Ocean, southwest of Portugal. Its total population was estimated in 2016 at 289,000. The capital of Madeira is Funchal, which is located on the main island's south coast. Jews have been associated with Madeira from the era of Crypto-Jews to World War II evacuees. Like the Jews of mainland Portugal, Madeira Jews are mainly related to Sephardi history, a Jewish ethnic division that represents communities who have originated in the Iberian Peninsula. There was once a Synagogue of Funchal, which is now disused. Menasseh Ben Israel was born in Madeira in 1604. Jews from Morocco arrived in 1819 and set themselves up in the cloth and wine trades. The Abudarham family from Gibraltar were involved in the Madeira wine industry from the early 1860s onward. The Jewish community on the island of Madeira expanded in 1940, due to the Evacuation of the Gibraltarian civilian population during World War II to Madeira, which included a number of Jews, who attended the Synagogue of Funchal. Some of these evacuees were buried in the Jewish Cemetery of Funchal. Tito Benady, a historian on Gibraltar Jewry, noted that when some 200 Jews of the 2000 evacuees from Gibraltar were evacuated as non combatants to Funchal, Madeira, at the start of World War II, they found a Jewish cemetery (Jewish Cemetery of Funchal) that belonged to the Abudarham family. The same family after whom the Abudarham Synagogue in Gibraltar was named. The Jewish Cemetery of Funchal is a Jewish cemetery located in Rua do Lazareto, Funchal, Madeira. Sephardi Jews as well as Ashkenazi Jews are buried there. Memorial commemorating Gibraltarian evacuees in Madeira In 2008, a monument was made in Gibraltar and shipped to Madeira where it has been erected next to a small chapel at Santa Caterina park, Funchal. The monument is a gift and symbol of ever-lasting thanks given by the people of Gibraltar to the island of Madeira and its inhabitants.www.love-madeira.com (accessed 13 December 2010) The city of Funchal and Gibraltar were twinned on 13 May 2009 by their then Mayors, the Mayor of Funchal Miguel Albuquerque and the mayor of Gibraltar who had been an evacuee from Gibraltar to Madeira Solomon Levy, respectively. The mayor of Gibraltar then had a meeting with the then President of Madeira Alberto Jo√£o Jardim. In 2013, a Passover Seder was held in Madeira sponsored by Shavei Israel and was attended by Bnei Anousim/Crypto-Jews.

He had a Club foot deformity which he lived through most of his childhood. He eventually moved to Brooklyn with his family to continue his surgical treatment in the city. He attended Boys High School (Brooklyn). He developed his interest of dentistry under W. G. Stewart. He eventually attended New York College of Dentistry in 1891 and obtained his degree the year after. He then opened his office on West 34th Street in New York City. Due to living his childhood as handicapped, Stanton's interest gave way to study of Orthodontics where he wanted to focus on correct malocclusions of children. He attended Angle School of Orthodontia in 1905 in St. Louis and moved back to New York City to practice as an Orthodontist. He was married to Virginia R. Stanton and had a son, John Alden Stanton and a daughter, Carolin Stanton Rhoades. Career Stanton helped organized the Alumni Society of Angle School of Orthodontia and eventually became the President of the Society in 1907. In addition, he played a significant part in formation of the Journal The American Orthodontist in 1907 which at that time was the first specialized dental publication. While in New York City, he also assisted Edward Angle with the Angle School of Orthodontia and became the secretary of the school from 1908 to 1909. He taught the course of Rhinology at the school during these two years. Based on Stanton's efforts to have a study group in order to promote orthodontic thought, Eastern Association of Graduates of Angle School of Orthodontia was formed. Stanton along with Rudolph Hanau designed a device to survey a human dentition. The results of their effort was published in an article named An Instrument for Surveying and Mapping the Denture. Under Stanton's guidance, Hanau was able to develop his interest in dentistry and make many of his contributions to dentistry. After the New York University College of Dentistry was bought by New York University, Stanton became a Professor in the Department of Preventative Dentistry and Occlusion. He was the first person to teach the subject of in a dental curriculum. He also became Professor in the Orthodontic Department until 1933. He eventually retired in 1937 after organizing a division of child research at NYU. He died on January 1, 1945. Research In order to understand the tooth movement, Stanton used the theory of least squares and was able to compute the least possible sum of total tooth movements necessary in treatment to change the positions of all teeth from existing malocclusion. Therefore he computed an imaginary point called centroid for each map.

His name appears in different spelling variants in the Low German dialect (Caj Schmedeke, Key Schmedeke, Schmedecke, Smedeke, Schmedcke, Schmiedeke) and in Standard High German (Cajus Schmiedlein, Caius Schmitlein, Schmidtlein, Schmittlein).  Biography  Schmiedtlein is assumed to have been born around 1555 in the Dithmarschen district of Northern Germany.Beckmann, Klaus (2001). Repertorium Orgelmusik 1150‚Äì2000 ‚Äì A Bio- bibliographical Index of Organ Music, Schott Musik International, p. 108 For an unspecified period he was active as organist in Husum until 1578, when he became organist at Saint Olaf's Church, Helsing√∏r. But just a year later had to resign from this post following a controversy over his own initiative to create a pedal division and thus modifying the organ without the church authority's approval.K√ºster, Konrad (2011).

Jahrhunderts zwischen Husum, Helsing√∏r und Danzig, Uni Freiburg, https://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/data/8449 (accessed 19 Dec 2015) It is unclear what Schmiedtlein did following his resignation in Helsing√∏r, but it is believed he went to Hamburg.Beckmann, Klaus (2001) p. 108 In 1585 Schmiedtlein became the organist at St. Mary's Church, Gda≈Ñsk.Rauschning, Hermann (1931).

Organist at St. Mary's Church, Gda≈Ñsk  Cajus Schmiedtlein was one of the performers during the inaugural concerts (which, according to a city source, caused a sensation in almost all of Europe) on the newly finished organ (56 stops, 3 manuals + pedal keyboard) at St. Mary's Church on 18 and 19 October 1585. The event is said to have been a social gathering during which people drank wine and played dice while Schmiedtlein performed.Renkewitz, Werner, and Janca, Jan (1984). Geschichter der Orgelbaukunst in Ost- und Westpreu√üen von 1333 bis 1944 ‚Äì Band 1, Verlag Weidlich, p. 73 The church authorities liked Schmiedtlein's playing and offered him the post of organist. Schmiedtlein demanded 200 Talers annually as salary and on top of that free lodgings, free firing wood and a notary position on the city council (his predecessor was paid 140 Talers and received free lodgings). It is unknown which terms were agreed to in the end, but Schmiedtlein accepted the post as organist.Rauschning, Hermann (1931) pp.50-51 He appears to have left the post for an extended period of time before being re-appointed for life by the city council in 1589.Rauschning, Hermann (1931) p. 51 He was absent again for some time in 1590 and for six weeks in 1591 while sorting out his personal financial affairs in Hamburg. During an absence in 1594 a complaint was received about the inadequate stand- in organist Schmiedtlein arranged to deputize for him.Rauschning, Hermann (1931) p. 55 In 1596 he traveled to Gr√∂ningen to play at the inauguration of the organ at the castle, while in 1598Rauschning, Hermann (1931) pp. 55-56 he was granted extended leave to go the spa town of Baden to cure an ailment. In 1611 the church authorities assigned the young Paul Siefert as his assistant.Rauschning, Hermann (1931) p. 113 Shortly prior to his death, Schmiedtlein wrote a letter to the city council in which he bitterly complained about Siefert's musical skills as well as his personality. In the same letter he also refuted accusations that under his stewardship of the organ the instrument fell into a state of bad repair.Rauschning, Hermann (1931) pp. 118-119  Musical works  While no known or confirmed works by Schmiedtlein exist, a collection of 42 compositions in a manuscript in Gda≈Ñsk have been attributed as being likely of his authorship.Rauschning, Hermann (1931) pp. 53-54 The collection, known as the Gda≈Ñsk Tablature of 1591 (Polish: Tabulatura gda≈Ñska; German: Danziger Tabulatur), is part of manuscript \\"Ms. 300 R/Vv, 123\\" State Archive in Gda≈Ñsk which contains various documents pertaining to the time period between 1571 and 1627.

Early life Sweeney was born on November 16, 1876, in Wheeling, West Virginia, the son of Andrew J. and Maria Sweeney. Andrew J. Sweeney was the founder of Wheeling Electric and a multi-term mayor of Wheeling, West Virginia. Walter Sweeney was educated locally and, in notable contrast to most senior officers of his time, never attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Military career With the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, Sweeney enlisted as a private in the 1st West Virginia Volunteer Infantry, a unit that saw no action during the war. By the war's end Sweeney had been commissioned as a second lieutenant.\\"Gen. Sweeney, Soldier 43 Yrs.\\" The Washington Post. April 11, 1963. B3. In February 1900, Second Lieutenant Sweeney received orders sending him to the Philippines.\\"The United Service: Army.\\" The New York Times. February 13, 1900. Page 5. During his service in the Philippines, Sweeney was involved in campaigns against the Pulahan in 1906 and 1907 and in suppressing the Moro Rebellion in Mindanao in 1910 and 1911. The 1910 United States Census shows Captain Sweeney in quarters at Ludlow Barracks, Mindanao, Philippines along with his wife, Anne Sweeney (age 30), and eldest daughter, Elizabeth J. Sweeney (age 4). During the 1916‚Äì1917 Pancho Villa Expedition (a.k.a. Mexican Expedition) Sweeney served as a captain on the staff of General John J. Pershing. Sweeney authored a pamphlet entitled Sketching Methods that was published in 1917. Intended for military officers tasked with quickly rendering tactical maps, Sweeney's introduction to the pamphlet states that its purpose \\"is to simplify instruction in the subject and to clear away the mathematics and the mystery which seem to cling to it.\\" The front matter of Sketching Methods identifies Sweeney as a captain in the Twenty-first United States Infantry stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco. The full text of Sketching Methods is available via HathiTrust. Following the entry of the United States into World War I, Sweeney was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel (August 20, 1917) and, near the end of the war, to the rank of colonel (October 24, 1918) in the National Army. During the war Sweeney was in charge of press relations and military censorship and was instrumental in the founding of the Stars and Stripes military newspaper. Sweeney saw combat during the war, winning the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, and the French National Order of the Legion of Honor.

McNair). The 1920 United States Census shows Sweeney living at Washington Barracks. Besides taking courses as a War College student, from 1924 through 1928 Sweeney was the director of the War College's supply and personnel courses. In 1924, Sweeney's book Military Intelligence: A New Weapon in War was published by the Frederick A. Stokes Company of New York. Looking back to the recently ended World War, Sweeney criticizes German military intelligence for failing to anticipate the willingness and ability of the United States to mobilize. He praises both U.S. military censorship and the Stars and Stripes newspaper for their contributions to the victory over the Central Powers. As Sweeney himself had key roles in both military censorship and the creation of the Stars and Stripes, his objectivity regarding their overall military value may be fairly questioned. That aside, Sweeney acknowledges that the military intelligence capabilities and techniques employed during World War I, though much improved compared to previous wars, will not be adequate for future wars. A New York Times review of Military Intelligence: A New Weapon in War describes it as an \\"intelligible and compact little book ... indispensable to the soldier, whether he is serving with the regular army, training in the National Guard, or a member of the organized reserve.\\"\\"The Eyes and Ears of an Army.\\" The New York Times. September 21, 1924. Page BR5. The \\"Publisher's Note\\" that appears in the front matter of Military Intelligence: A New Weapon in War includes this biographical sketch of Sweeney: > There are few men in America with broader experience in Military > Intelligence than Lieutenant Colonel Walter C. Sweeney. Entering the regular > army in 1899 from civil life as a second lieutenant of infantry, he served, > all over the world, through the several grades to his present rank.

Promoted to Brigadier General in December 1935, Sweeney took command of the Sixth Infantry Brigade at Fort Douglas, Utah. Following his promotion to Major General in June 1938, Sweeney took command of the Third Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington. In taking command of the Third Infantry Division, Sweeney was one of five generals\\"5 for Command of Streamlined Divisions Named.\\" Chicago Daily Tribune.

Under Sweeney's command, the newly reorganized Third Infantry Division participated in important war games, including a mock invasion of California involving land, sea, and air forces.\\"Fleet Off for War Games: Force of 75 Vessels to Join 'Invading' Army Off California Coast Fleet of 75 Warships Embarks to Join Invading Black Army.\\" Los Angeles Times. January 16, 1940. Page A1. Among the future generals included in Sweeney's Third Infantry Division command were Mark W. Clark and Dwight David Eisenhower. In Eisenhower: A Soldier's Life, 1890‚Äì1945, military historian Carlo d'Este relates a story of then-Lt. Colonel Eisenhower being offered a coveted invitation to one of Sweeney's regular poker games. Although Sweeney was a keen card player, newcomer Eisenhower won so much money from Sweeney and the other poker-game regulars that he was not known to have been invited back.d'Este, Carlo. Eisenhower: A Soldier's Life, 1890‚Äì1945. New York: Henry Holt, 2002. Pages 262-263. Sweeney retired from active duty due to age on November 30, 1940. However, in June 1942 he was called out of retirement to head the California State Guard.Davies, Lawrence E. \\"Army Man Heads California Guard.\\" New York Times. June 10, 1942. Page 11. He retired from this post in 1943. Sweeney died on April 9, 1963, at Letterman Army Hospital, San Francisco, California. Family The 1880 United States Census shows that Walter Sweeney, then 3, shared his family home with his parents and seven siblings: Rose M. Sweeney, 22; Andrew T. Sweeney, 20; Mary Sweeney, 16; Sallie Sweeney, 15; Willie Sweeney,11; Frank Sweeney, 5; and Edgar Sweeney, 2. Walter C. Sweeney married Anne Eloise McConnell (born April 26, 1873) of Tennessee on April 10, 1904. They remained married until her death on December 15, 1953, in San Francisco, California.

It is a generalization of a Vickrey‚ÄìClarke‚ÄìGroves auction. A VCG auction performs a specific task: dividing items among people. A VCG mechanism is more general: it can be used to select any outcome out of a set of possible outcomes.  Notation  There is a set X of possible outcomes. There are n agents which have different valuations for each outcome. The valuation of agent i is represented as a function: : v_i : X \\\\longrightarrow R_+ which expresses the value it has for each alternative, in monetary terms. It is assumed that the agents have Quasilinear utility functions; this means that, if the outcome is x and in addition the agent receives a payment p_i (positive or negative), then the total utility of agent i is: : u_i := v_i(x) + p_i Our goal is to select an outcome that maximizes the sum of values, i.e.: : x^{opt}(v) = \\\\arg\\\\max_{x\\\\in X} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n v_i(x) In other words, our social-choice function is utilitarian.  Solution family  The VCG family is a family of mechanisms that implements the utilitarian welfare function. A typical mechanism in the VCG family works in the following way: 1\\\\. It asks the agents to report their value function. I.e, each agent i should report v_i(x) for each option x. 2\\\\. Based on the agents' report-vector v, it calculates x^* = x^{opt}(v) as above. 3\\\\. It pays, to each agent i, a sum of money equal to the total values of the other agents: : p_i := \\\\sum_{j eq i} v_j(x^*) 4\\\\. It pays, to each agent i, an additional sum, based on an arbitrary function of the values of the other agents: : p_i += h_i(v_{-i}) where v_{-i} = (v_1, \\\\dots, v_{i-1}, v_{i+1}, \\\\dots, v_n), that is, h_i is a function that only depends on the valuation of the others.  Truthfulness  Every mechanism in the VCG family is a truthful mechanism, that is, a mechanism where bidding the true valuation is a dominant strategy. The trick is in step 3. The agent is paid the total value of the other agents; hence, together with its own value, the total welfare of the agent is exactly equal to the total welfare of society. Hence, the incentives of the agent are aligned with those of the society and the agent is incentivized to be truthful in order to help the mechanism achieve its goal. The function h_i, in step 4, does not affect the agent's incentives, since it depends only on the declarations of the other agents.  The Clarke pivot rule  The function h_i is a parameter of the mechanism. Every selection of h_i yields a different mechanism in the VCG family. We could take, for example: : h_i(v_{-i}) = 0, but then we would have to actually pay the players to participate in the auction. We would rather prefer that players give money to the mechanism. An alternative function is: : h_i(v_{-i}) = - \\\\max_{x \\\\in X} \\\\sum_{j eq i} v_j(x) It is called the Clarke pivot rule. With the Clarke pivot rule, the total amount paid by the player is: ::(social welfare of others if i were absent) - (social welfare of others when i is present). This is exactly the externality of player i. When the valuations of all agents are weakly-positive, the Clarke pivot rule has two important properties: * Individual rationality: for every player i, v_i (x) + p_i \\\\geq 0. It means that all the players are getting positive utility by participating in the auction. No one is forced to bid. * No positive transfers: for every player i, p_i \\\\leq 0 . The mechanism does not need to pay anything to the bidders. This makes the VCG mechanism a win-win game: the players receive the outcomes they desire, and pay an amount which is less than their gain. So the players remain with a net positive gain, and the mechanism gains a net positive payment.  Weighted VCG mechanism  Instead of maximizing the sum of values, we may want to maximize a weighted sum: : x^{opt}(v) = \\\\arg\\\\max_{x\\\\in X} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i v_i(x) where w_i is a weight assigned to agent i. The VCG mechanism from above can easily be generalized by changing the price function in step 3 to: : p_i := {1 \\\\over w_i} \\\\sum_{j eq i} w_j v_j(x^*)  Cost minimization  The VCG mechanism can be adapted to situations in which the goal is to minimize the sum of costs (instead of maximizing the sum of gains). Costs can be represented as negative values, so that minimization of cost is equivalent to maximization of values. The payments in step 3 are negative: each agent has to pay the total cost incurred by all other agents. If agents are free to choose whether to participate or not, then we must make sure that their net payment is non-negative (this requirement is called individual rationality). The Clarke pivot rule can be used for this purpose: in step 4, each agent i is paid the total cost that would have been incurred by other agents, if the agent i would not participate. The net payment to agent i is its marginal contribution to reducing the total cost.  Applications  = Auctions = Vickrey‚ÄìClarke‚ÄìGroves auction is an application of VCG mechanism for welfare maximization. Here, X is the set of all possible allocations of items to the agents. Each agent assigns a personal monetary value to each bundle of items, and the goal is to maximize the sum of the values of all agents. A well-known special case is the Vickrey Auction. Here, there is only a single item, and the set X contains n+1 possible outcomes: either sell the item to one of the n agents, or not sell it at all. In step 3, the winner agent is paid 0 (since the total value of the others is 0) and the losers receive a payment equal to the declared value of the winner. In step 4, the winner pays the second- highest bid (the total value of the others had he not participated) and the losers pay the declared value of the winner (the total value of the others had they not participated). All in all, the winner pays the second-highest bid and the losers pay 0. A VCG mechanism can also be used in a double auction. It is the most general form of incentive-compatible double-auction since it can handle a combinatorial auction with arbitrary value functions on bundles. Unfortunately, it is not budget-balanced: the total value paid by the buyers is smaller than the total value received by the sellers. Hence, in order to make it work, the auctioneer has to subsidize the trade. = Public project = The government wants to decide whether to undertake a certain project. The cost of the project is C. Each citizen derives a different value from the project. The project should be undertaken if the sum of values of all citizens is more than the cost. Here, the VCG mechanism with the Clarke pivot rule means that a citizen pays a non-zero tax for that project if and only if they are pivotal, i.e., without their declaration the total value is less than C and with their declaration the total value is more than C. This taxing scheme is incentive-compatible, but again it is not budget-balanced - the total amount of tax collected is usually less than C. = Quickest paths = The quickest path problem is a cost-minimization problem. The goal is to send a message between two points in a communication network, which is modeled as a graph. Each computer in the network is modeled as an edge in the graph. Different computers have different transmission speeds, so every edge in the network has a numeric cost equal to the number of milliseconds it takes to transmit the message. Our goal is to send the message as quickly as possible, so we want to find the path with the smallest total cost. If we know the transmission-time of each computer (-the cost of each edge), then we can use a standard algorithm for solving the shortest path problem. If we do not know the transmission times, then we have to ask each computer to tell us its transmission-time. But, the computers have their own selfish interests so they might not tell us the truth. For example, a computer might tell us that its transmission time is very large, so that we will not bother it with our messages. The VCG mechanism can be used to solve this problem. Here, X is the set of all possible paths; the goal is to select a path x\\\\in X with minimal total cost. The value of an agent, v_i(x), is minus the time it spent on the message: it is negative if i\\\\in x and it is zero if i otin x. The payment in step 3 is negative: each agent should pay to us the total time that the other agents spent on the message (note that the value is measured in units of time. We assume that it is possible to pay computers in units of time, or that it there is a standard way to translate time to money). This means that, together with its own spent time, each agent actually loses the total time it took the message to arrive its destination, so the agent is incentivized to help the mechanism achieve the shortest transmission time. The Clarke pivot rule can be used to make the mechanism individually-rational: after paying us the cost, each agent receives from us a positive payment, which is equal to the time it would have taken the message to arrive its destination if the agent would not have been present. Obviously, this time is weakly larger than the time required when the agent is present, so the net gain of every agent is weakly positive. Intuitively, each agent is paid according to its marginal contribution to the transmission. Other graph problems can be solved in a similar way, e.g. minimum spanning tree or maximum matching. A similar solution applies to the more general case where each agent holds some subset of the edges. For another example, where the VCG mechanism provides a sub- optimal approximation, see Truthful job scheduling.  Uniqueness  A VCG mechanism implements a utilitarian social-choice function - a function that maximizes a weighted sum of values (also called an affine maximizer). Roberts' theorem proves that, if: * The agents' valuation functions are unrestricted (each agent can have as value function any function from X to \\\\mathbb{R}), and - * There are at least three different possible outcomes (X\\\\geq 3 and at least three different outcomes from X can happen), then only weighted utilitarian functions can be implemented. So with unrestricted valuations, the social-choice functions implemented by VCG mechanisms are the only functions that can be implemented truthfully. Moreover, the price-functions of the VCG mechanisms are also unique in the following sense. If: * The domains of the agents' valuations are connected sets (particularly, agents can have real- valued preferences and not only integral preferences); * There is a truthful mechanism that implements a certain Outcome function with certain payment functions p_1,\\\\dots,p_n; * There is another truthful mechanism that implements the same Outcome function with different payment functions p'_1,\\\\dots,p'_n; Then, there exist functions h_1,\\\\dots,h_n such that, for all i: ::p'_i(v_i,v_{-i}) = p_i(v_i,v_{-i}) + h_i(v_{-i}) I.e, the price functions of the two mechanisms differ only by a function that does not depend on the agent's valuation v_i (only on the valuations of the other agents). This means that VCG mechanisms are the only truthful mechanisms that maximize the utilitarian social-welfare.  Computational issues  A VCG mechanism has to calculate the optimal outcome, based on the agents' reports (step 2 above). In some cases, this calculation is computationally difficult. For example, in combinatorial auctions, calculating the optimal assignment is NP-hard. Sometimes there are approximation algorithms to the optimization problem, but, using such an approximation might make the mechanism non-truthful.

Background  In June 1942, the Japanese occupied some of the western Aleutian islands, and hoped to occupy Amchitka. A Japanese survey team scouted the island but rejected it for military purposes. During the Aleutian campaign an air force base was needed near the occupied islands of Attu and Kiska. Amchitcka was ruled out as a possible candidate due to its close proximity only 50 miles away from the island of Kiska. At the War Department's suggestion, an initial reconnaissance of Amchitka was carried out in September 1942, which found that it would be difficult to build an airstrip on the island. Nevertheless, planners decided on December 13 that the airfield \\"had to be built\\" to prevent the Japanese from doing the same. A further reconnaissance mission visited Amchitka from 17 to 19 December, and reported that a fighter strip could be built in two to three weeks, and a main airfield in three to four months. In December 1942, plans were drawn out for the landings dubbed \\"Operation Longview\\". The operation would scrape together 2,000 immediate U.S military in the Aleutian Islands by the Alaska Defense Command. It was thought through reconnaissance that Amchitka was occupied by a small Japanese military presence. Eager to remove the Japanese, the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed to move quickly to regain the territory.  Landing at Constantine Harbor  The operation was set for January 9, but delayed due to the weather conditions. American forces made the unopposed landing on the island on January 12, 1943, three days later. Nearly 2,100 troops disembarked in Constantine Harbor without opposition. Their only enemies were the weather, the unpredictable current, and the rock-studded waters through which the landing was made. The destroyer was guarding the as that transport put the preliminary Army security unit on the shores of Constantine Harbor, Amchitka Island. The destroyer maneuvered into the rock-edged harbor and stayed there until the last men had landed and then turned to the business of clearing the harbor. A strong current, however, swept Worden onto a pinnacle that tore into a hull beneath the engine room and caused a complete loss of power. The destroyer then broached and began breaking up in the surf; Comdr. William G. Pogue, the destroyer's commanding officer, ordered abandon ship; and, as he was directing that effort, was swept overboard into the wintry seas by a heavy wave that broke over the ship. Pogue was among the fortunate ones, however, because he was hauled, unconscious, out of the sea. Fourteen of the crew drowned. Once on the ground the island was cleared and found to be empty of Japanese military.USS Worden being abandoned shortly after a hull breach beneath the engine room During the first night ashore a \\"willowaw\\" (a violent squall) smashed many of the landing boats and swept a troop transport aground. On the second day a blizzard wracked the island with snow, sleet, and biting wind. Lasting for nearly two weeks, the blizzard finally subsided enough to reveal to a Japanese scout plane from Kiska the American beachhead on Amchitka. Harassed by bombing and strafing attacks from Kiska, engineers continued work on an airfield on Amchitka completing it in mid-February. Japanese attacks on the island then sharply declined. By February 16, the fighter strip was ready for limited operation. On that day eight P-40's arrived on Amchitka, and within a week they were running patrols over Kiska. The stage was now set for the next phase of operations, amphibious attacks to eject the Japanese from their Aleutian footholds.

With regular condominiums, the unit owner usually owns the internal unit space and a percentage of the common property; in the case of a freehold condominium (or a bare/vacant land condominium) the owner owns the land and building and a percentage of any common property shared roadways and amenities. The Canadian Condominium Institute is a non-profit association of condominium owners and corporations with chapters in each province and territory. The Condo Owners Association COA Ontario is a non-profit association representing condominium owners with divisions across the province and districts within the various municipalities.  History  Before 1981 condominiums made up less than ten percent of homes built in Canada. British Columbia Strata Housing Over a million people live in strata housing in British Columbia. Strata properties are a popular housing choice in B.C. because it is convenient, provides security and added amenities and is usually less costly than buying a single-family home. As the price of single-family housing has soared to unprecedented levels in Vancouver, the number of new condominium sales has increased, along with prices. According to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver, the benchmark price for a condo in July 2016 was $510,600 in the region, up 27.4 per cent from the same month in 2015. =Insurance under the Strata Property Act= The Act requires all stratas to maintain an insurance policy for a minimum of $2 million (property and liability) that covers the common elements and the units as originally bu√Ølt.  Ontario  There are over 1.3 million condo owners and/or residents living in more than 587,000 condominium units in Ontario. One-half of new construction in 2013 was condominium-related.In, Condo Owners Association, COA Toronto, March 10, 2010 In recent years, the condominium industry has been booming in Canada, with dozens of new towers being erected each year. Toronto is the centre of this boom, with 17,000 new units being sold in 2005, more than double second place Miami's 7,500 units. Toronto's condo population has grown from 978,125 in 2011 to 1.478 million people in 2016 representing 54.7% of the city population according to Toronto Condo News. Outside of Toronto, the most common forms of condominium have been townhomes rather than highrises, although that trend may be altered as limitations are placed on \\"Greenfields\\" (see Greenfield land) developments in those areas (in turn, forcing developers to expand upward rather than outward and to consider more condominium conversions instead of new housing). Particular growth areas are in Kitchener/Waterloo, Barrie, and London. In fact, after Toronto, the Golden Horseshoe Chapter of the Canadian Condominium Institute is one of that organization's most thriving chapters. =Ontario Condominium Act= Condominium Authority of Ontario Condominium Authority of Ontario (CAO) was established, in 2017, by the Province of Ontario to address concerns about condo living and management in the province. Its goal is to minimize issues before they become disputes to help with community building. To do this they have implemented three pillars; education, mandated reporting and disclosure of information, and a tribunal for handling disputes that arise In a March 2018 Toronto Condo News article, the Executive Director of the Condominium Authority of Ontario explains it has an \\"overarching goal to enhance consumer protection for condominium owners, directors and residents. This is made possible through a comprehensive offering of information about condominium ownership including self-help tools, mandatory director training, and a new online dispute resolution service, the Condominium Authority Tribunal (CAT).\\" Ontario Condominium Act, 1998 Until December 2015, condominiums in Ontario were governed by the Ontario Condominium Act, 1998 with each development establishing a corporation to deal with day-to-day functions (maintenance, repairs, etc.). A board of directors is elected by the owners of units (or, in the case of a common elements condominium corporation, the owners of the common interest in the common elements) in the development on at least a yearly basis. A general meeting is held annually to deal with board elections and the appointment of an auditor (or waiving of audit). Other matters can also be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting, but special meetings of the owners can be called by the board and, in some cases, by the owners themselves, at any time. The Ontario Condominium Act, 1998 provided an effectively wide range of development options, including Standard, Phased, Vacant Land, Common Element and Leasehold condominiums. Certain existing condominiums can amalgamate, and existing properties can be converted to condominium (provided municipal requirements for the same are met). Accordingly, the expanded and expanding use of the condominium concept is permitting developers and municipalities to consider newer and more interesting forms of development to meet social needs. On this issue, Ontario condominium lawyer Michael Clifton writes, \\"Condominium development has steadily increased in Ontario for several years. While condominiums typically represent an attractive lifestyle and home-ownership alternatives for buyers, they also, importantly, introduce a new approach to community planning for home builders and municipal approval authorities in Ontario. ...[There are] opportunities for developers to be both creative and profitable in building, and municipalities more flexible and imaginative in planning and approving, developments that will become sustainable communities.\\"In, A Comment about Condominiums, Community Planning and Sustainability, Forum Magazine , Dec 6/Jan 7, p. 28. Reserve fund contributions are ten per cent of the condominium fees collected or higher. Contrary to other jurisdictions such as Alberta, Ontario does not provide flexibility for small condo corporations to conduct their own reserve fund study, or to update it less frequently than required for large corporations. Managers of small condominium corporations have asked the Ontario Ministry of Consumer Services to review this requirement as it becomes burdensome for the management of smaller buildings. Ontario - Condo Owners Association & Condo Act Review The Condo Owners Association (COA) was established by Founder Linda Pinizzotto in 2010 as a non profit Association to provide a cohesive united voice to represent condominium owners across the Province of Ontario to all levels of Government and to advocate for a Condo Act Review recognizing that the Condo Act was established in 1998 and since that time there had not been any changes to the Act. The COA supports the development of new legislation and advocates the Province of Ontario to address concerns. To assist the public to know more about condominiums and condominium operations, the Condo Owners Association holds a position on various stakeholder groups to provides representation and information for condo owners, buyers and the general public.In Condominium Information, , December 15, 2012 In Ontario, the provincial Condominium Act 1998 was under review, as of August 2015, and the Condo Owners Association (COA Ontario) was a stakeholder in the process as well a strong voice in Condo Property Management company and Manager licensing as a Stakeholder in the Condominium Property Managers examining the Impact of Regulation on Consumers.

Protecting Condominium Owners Act, 2015 On May 27, 2015, David Orazietti, Ontario's Minister of Government and Consumer Services, introduced a new bill called the Protecting Condominium Owners Act, 2015. The bill called for the creation of a new Condominium Authority, which would be funded by a $1 a month fee on individual condo owners and by condo developers, that would provide advice for condo owners, facilitate dispute resolution between owners and boards regarding issues such as noise complaints, bylaw infractions or an inability to get financial statements from the board of directors. Critics of the bill said that the bill would result in increased fees and more special assessments. The aim of the Act is to make it less expensive to resolve disputes. The Act will require boards to issue reports to owners on things such as insurance or legal proceedings. Clear language will spell out the amount of an adequate Reserve fund study and help eliminate surprise hikes in condo fees or special assessments levied against each unit. On December 2, 2015 Third Reading of this Act was Carried on division and on December 3, 2015 Royal Assent was received, = Condo Manager Licensing Authority = The Act introduces a new body, the Condo Manager Licensing Authority. There will be training and licensing of condominium management companies and individuals to ensure those hired to run multimillion-dollar condominium corporations are adequately trained to reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement. The Act also introduces a code of ethics for condo managers. There were 2,500 people managing 10,000 condominium developments in Ontario, with 700,000 individual units.  Saskatchewan  In Saskatchewan, condominiums are registered as a special type of non-profit corporation that is owned by the unit owners; the owners elect a board of directors; the operation of the corporation is governed by The Condominium Property Act, 1993.

In addition to military expansion, this period saw the flourishing of medieval Georgian architecture, painting and poetry, which was frequently expressed in the development of ecclesiastic art, as well as the creation of first major works of secular literature. Lasting more than two centuries, the Golden Age came to a gradual end due to persistent invasions of nomads, such as Mongols, as well as the spread of Black Death by these same nomadic groups. Georgia further weakened after the Fall of Constantinople, which effectively marked the end of the Eastern Roman Empire, Georgia's traditional ally. As a result of these processes, by the 15th century Georgia fractured and turned into an isolated enclave, largely cutoff from Christian Europe and surrounded by hostile Turco- Iranic neighbors. Georgia's decline resulted in \\"emasculation\\" of its image in Russian Imperial perceptions, which systematically overlooked the nation's origins and instead portrayed it as a vulnerable, feminine \\"orient\\" in need of imperial protection.Susan Layton. Ph.D Yale University. Literature And Empire: Scholar Susan Layton Discusses Russia's 'Literary Caucasus'.

As he came of age under the guidance of his court minister, George of Chqondidi, David IV suppressed dissent of feudal lords and centralized the power in his hands to effectively deal with foreign threats. In 1121, he decisively defeated much larger Turkish armies during the Battle of Didgori, with fleeing Seljuq Turks being run down by pursuing Georgian cavalry for several days. A huge amount of booty and prisoners were captured by David's army, which had also secured Tbilisi and inaugurated a new era of revival. Javakhishvili, Ivane (1982), k'art'veli eris istoria (The History of the Georgian Nation), vol. 2, pp. 184-187. Tbilisi State University Press. To highlight his country's higher status, he became the first Georgian king to reject the highly respected titles bestowed by the Eastern Roman Empire, Georgia‚Äôs longtime ally, indicating that Georgia would deal with its powerful friend only on a parity basis. Due to close family ties between Georgian and Byzantine royalty - Princess Martha of Georgia, aunt of David IV, was once a Byzantine Empress Consort - by 11th century as many as 16 Georgian ruling princes and kings had held Byzantine titles, David becoming the last one to do so.Cyril Toumanoff. Studies in Christian Caucasian history. Georgetown University Press, 1963. p 202 David IV made particular emphasis on removing the vestiges of unwanted eastern influences, which the Georgians considered forced, in favor of the traditional Christian and Byzantine overtones. As part of this effort he founded the Gelati Monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which became an important center of scholarship in the Eastern Orthodox Christian world of that time. David also played a personal role in reviving Georgian religious hymnography, composing the Hymns of Repentance (, ), a sequence of eight free-verse psalms. In this emotional repentance of his sins, David sees himself as reincarnating the Biblical David, with a similar relationship to God and to his people. His hymns also share the idealistic zeal of the contemporaneous European crusaders to whom David was a natural ally in his struggle against the Seljuks.Donald Rayfield, \\"Davit II\\", in: Robert B.

HarperCollins, . =Reigns of Demetrius I and George III= Archangel of Kintsvisi, complete with scarce and expensive natural ultramarine paint, evidences increasing sophistication and resources of Georgian masters following the reign of George III The kingdom continued to flourish under Demetrius I, the son of David. Although his reign saw a disruptive family conflict related to royal succession, Georgia remained a centralized power with a strong military, with several decisive victories against the Muslims in Ganja, gates of which were captured by Demetrius and moved as a trophy to Gelati. A talented poet, Demetrius also continued his father's contributions to Georgia's religious polyphony. The most famous of his hymns is Thou Art a Vineyard, which is dedicated to Virgin Mary, the patron saint of Georgia, and is still sung in Georgia's churches 900 years after its creation. Demetrius was succeeded by his son George in 1156, beginning a stage of more offensive foreign policy. The same year he ascended to the throne, George launched a successful campaign against the Seljuq sultanate of Ahlat. He freed the important Armenian town of Dvin from Turkish vassalage and was thus welcomed as a liberator in the area. George also continued the process of intermingling Georgian royalty with the highest ranks of the Eastern Roman Empire, testament of which is the marriage of his daughter Rusudan to Manuel Komnenos, the son of Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos. Zenith of development under Queen Tamar The successes of her predecessors were built upon by Queen Tamar, daughter of George III, who became the first female ruler of Georgia in her own right and under whose leadership the Georgian state reached the zenith of power and prestige in the Middle Ages. She not only shielded much of her Empire from further Turkish onslaught but successfully pacified internal tensions, including a coup organized by her Russian husband Yury Bogolyubsky, prince of Novgorod. Additionally, she pursued policies that were considered very enlightened for her time period, such as abolishing state-sanctioned death penalty and torture.Machitadze, Zacharia. Mirianashvili, Lado. Lives of the Georgian Saints. St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood: 2006, p. 167 =Foreign interventions and dealings in the Holy Land = Among the remarkable events of Tamar's reign was the foundation of the empire of Trebizond on the Black Sea in 1204. This state was established in the northeast of the crumbling Byzantine Empire with the help of the Georgian armies, which supported Alexios I of Trebizond and his brother, David Komnenos, both of whom were Tamar's relatives.Tamar's paternal aunt was the Comnenoi's grandmother on their father‚Äôs side, as it has been conjectured by Cyril Toumanoff(1940). Alexios and David were fugitive Byzantine princes raised at the Georgian court. According to Tamar's historian, the aim of the Georgian expedition to Trebizond was to punish the Byzantine emperor Alexius IV Angelus for his confiscation of a shipment of money from the Georgian queen to the monasteries of Antioch and Mount Athos. Tamar's Pontic endeavor can also be explained by her desire to take advantage of the Western European Fourth Crusade against Constantinople to set up a friendly state in Georgia's immediate southwestern neighborhood, as well as by the dynastic solidarity to the dispossessed Comnenoi.Eastmond (1998), pp. 153‚Äì154.Vasiliev (1935), pp. 15‚Äì19. Golden cross of Queen Tamar, composed of rubies, emeralds, and large pearls The country's power had grown to such extent that in the later years of Tamar's rule, the Kingdom was primarily concerned with the protection of the Georgian monastic centers in the Holy Land, eight of which were listed in Jerusalem.Antony Eastmond. Royal Imagery in Medieval Georgia. Penn State Press, 1998. p. 122 Saladin's biographer BahƒÅ' ad-Dƒ´n ibn ≈†addƒÅd reports that, after the Ayyubid conquest of Jerusalem in 1187, Tamar sent envoys to the sultan to request that the confiscated possessions of the Georgian monasteries in Jerusalem be returned. Saladin's response is not recorded, but the queen's efforts seem to have been successful.Pahlitzsch, Johannes, \\"Georgians and Greeks in Jerusalem (1099‚Äì1310)\\", in Ciggaar & Herman (1996), pp. 38‚Äì39. Ibn ≈†addƒÅd furthermore claims that Tamar outbid the Byzantine emperor in her efforts to obtain the relics of the True Cross, offering 200,000 gold pieces to Saladin who had taken the relics as booty at the battle of Hattin ‚Äì to no avail, however.Antony Eastmond.

London: Allen & Unwin, 1976, p. 11 =Commerce and culture= With flourishing commercial centers now under Georgia's control, industry and commerce brought new wealth to the country and Tamar's court. Tribute extracted from the neighbors and war booty added to the royal treasury, giving rise to the saying that \\"the peasants were like nobles, the nobles like princes, and the princes like kings.\\"Suny, Ronald Grigor, The Making of the Georgian Nation. Indiana University Press: 1994, p. 40Toumanoff, Cyril. \\"Armenia and Georgia,\\" The Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 4, pp. 593‚Äì637. Cambridge England: Cambridge University Press: 1966, p. pp. 624‚Äì625. Tamar's reign also marked the continuation of artistic development in the country commenced by her predecessors. While her contemporary Georgian chronicles continued to enshrine Christian morality, the religious theme started to lose its earlier dominant position to the highly original secular literature. This trend culminated in an epic written by Georgia's national poet Rustaveli - The Knight in the Panther's Skin (Vepkhistq'aosani). Revered in Georgia as the greatest achievement of native literature, the poem celebrates the Medieval humanistic ideals of chivalry, friendship and courtly love. Nomadic invasions and the gradual decline of Georgia Despite setbacks at the hands of Mongols, Georgia continued to produce cultural landmarks, such as these frescoes at Ubisi by Damiane - one of Georgia's distinctive medieval artists. Around the time when Mongols invaded the Slavic northeast of Europe, the nomadic armies simultaneously pushed down south to Georgia. George IV, son of Queen Tamar, put aside his preparations in support of the Fourth Crusade and concentrated on fighting the invaders, but the Mongol onslaught was too strong to overcome. Georgians suffered heavy losses in the war and the king himself was severely wounded. As a result, George became handicapped and died prematurely at the age of 31. George's sister Rusudan assumed the throne but she was too inexperienced and her country too weakened to push out the nomads. In 1236 a prominent Mongol commander Chormaqan led a massive army against Georgia and its vassals, forcing Queen Rusudan to flee to the west, leaving eastern Georgia in the hands of noblemen who eventually made peace with the Mongols and agreed to pay tribute; those who resisted were subject to complete annihilation. The Mongol armies chose not to cross the natural barrier of Likhi Range in pursuit of the Georgian Queen, sparing western Georgia of the widespread rampages. Later, Rusudan attempted to gain support from Pope Gregory IX, but without any success. In 1243, Georgia was finally forced to acknowledge the Great Khan as its overlord. Perhaps no Mongol invasion devastated Georgia as much as the decades of anti-Mongol struggle that took place in the country. The first anti-Mongol uprising started in 1259 under the leadership of David VI and lasted for almost thirty years. The anti-Mongol strife continued without much success under Kings Demetrius the Self- Sacrificer, who was executed by the Mongols, and David VIII. Georgia finally saw a period of revival unknown since the Mongol invasions under King George V the Brilliant. A far-sighted monarch, George V managed to play on the decline of the Ilkhanate, stopped paying tribute to the Mongols, restored the pre-1220 state borders of Georgia, and returned the Empire of Trebizond into Georgia's sphere of influence. Under him, Georgia established close international commercial ties, mainly with the Byzantine Empire - to which George V had family ties - but also with the great European maritime republics, Genoa and Venice. George V also achieved the restoration of several Georgian monasteries in Jerusalem to the Georgian Orthodox Church and gained free passage for Georgian pilgrims to the Holy Land. The widespread use of the Jerusalem cross in Medieval Georgia - an inspiration for the modern national flag of Georgia - is thought to date to the reign of George V.D. Kldiashvili, History of the Georgian Heraldry, Parlamentis utskebani, 1997, p. 35. The death of George V, the last of great kings of unified Georgia, precipitated an irreversible decline of the Kingdom. The following decades were marked by Black Death, which was spread by the nomads, as well as numerous invasions under the leadership of Tamerlane, who devastated the country's economy, population, and urban centers. After the fall of Byzantium, Georgia definitively turned into an isolated, fractured Christian enclave, a relic of the faded East Roman epoch surrounded by hostile Turco-Iranic neighbors. =Artistic inheritance= File:Golden Theotokos from Khobi, Georgia 12th century.jpgGolden Theotokos of Khobi Monastery, with some precious stones stolen by the communists File:Georgia Khakhuli triptych.jpgTryptich of Khakhuli File:Khakhuli icon.

Geography Lough Inagh is located about east of Clifden on the R344 road in the Inagh Valley. The Twelve Bens range lies to the west of the lake, with Derryclare and Bencorr directly overlooking the lake. The bulk of the Maumturks range and its long central spine lies to the east of the lake, with two highest peaks of Letterbreckaun and Binn idir an D√° Log , also overlooking the Lough. Lough Inagh is fed from several mountain streams in the area, but most importantly from the Gleninagh River that starts high up in the Gleninagh Valley on the slopes of Benbaun and Bencollaghduff, and the Tooreennacoona River. After flowing into Lough Inagh, the river flows into Derryclare Lough, and then into Ballynahinch Lake, where it eventually joins the Owenmore River where is flows into Bertraghboy Bay. Fishing Lough Inagh is noted for its lake and river fishing with spring salmon, grilse and sea trout (depending on season), and the fishing is mostly done from boats, however, the lake is too big for rowing and an outboard motor is recommended (there are a couple of submerged rocks so caution should be taken). The Lough and its fishing rights are privately owned and controlled by local fishing lodges in the Inagh Valley. Irish fishing author, Peter O'Reilly, said about Lough Inagh that \\"This lough will take more than one day to explore adequately, for it can be one of the best\\". Scenic location The lake is a popular scenic location and to the west, gives views directly into the large deep southerly corrie between Derryclare and Bencorr (, meaning \\"wood of the big corrie\\"), as well as the smaller corrie between Bencorr and Bencorr North Top (, meaning \\"wood of the small corrie\\"). It also looks into the Derryclare Wood and Derryclare Nature Reserve, which lie at the base of the two corries as they meet the Lough. The northernmost end of the Lough, just beside Bencorrbeg , has views into the Gleninagh Valley (, meaning \\"Valley of Ivy\\"), from which the Lough derives its name; the south wall of the valley is the impressive Carrot Ridge rock-climbing location, while at the head of the valley are Bencollaghduff , and the highest peak in the Twelve Bens range, Benbaun at .

He was the first full-time medical doctor in electrotherapy in the United States and wrote the first book on the subject.  Biography  Garratt was born in Brookhaven, New York, on October 3, 1813. His father was Richard Garratt. He was a graduate of Lenox Academy, and in 1836 a graduate of Medical School, College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. He was also a graduate of the Berkshire Medical College. Garratt was surgeon to the United States Dragoons at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, and United States Vice Consul at Port-Au-Prince for two years. After the government position as Vice Consul he practiced medicine and kept an apothecary's shop in Abington, Massachusetts. He was admitted to the Massachusetts Medical Society in 1849. Garratt came to Hanover, Massachusetts, in 1851 and resided in the house left vacant by Dr. Fobes which was originally built by the Rev. Joab G. Cooper, rector of Saint Andrew's Parish. The house was built with wood from the old Episcopal Church building at Church Hill when it was torn down to make way for the present church in Hanover. Flexible 'button' battery assembly patent  Medical electrical invention  Garratt patented a physiological \\"button\\" battery on July 6, 1869. The invention (no. 92,301) consisted of several button size discs made from copper or silver and an alloy of dissimilar metals. The assembly of \\"button\\" battery discs was constructed into a flexible insulation base. The small batteries were wired together and a set metallic connections were made at each end of the assembly for the plus and minus electrical connections. The idea behind the flexible insulation base was so that it could be worn upon uneven body parts like arms and legs.  Family  Garratt's daughter Harriet was born in 1838. His son Charles was born in 1844. His second son, Joshua, was born in 1850 and his third son, Allen, was born in 1853. Garratt's first wife, Elizabeth, was born in 1817. His second wife, Martha, was born about 1815. By 1880 Garratt was widowed. Later life  Garratt moved to Boston after practicing in Hanover for about twenty years. In Boston he had a medical office for many years in the rear of the renown Tremont House. He became the first full-time medical doctor in electrotherapy in the United States.  Retirement and death  Garratt retired from practice in 1888. In 1891 he died at the age of seventy- eight years.

She is Professor of English and American Studies at Tel Aviv University, where she is also the Samuel L. and Perry Haber Chair on the Study of the Jewish Experience in the United States, and director of the Goldreich Family Institute for Yiddish Language, Literature, and Culture. Specializing in the role of language, especially Yiddish, in expressing personal identity in Jewish American literature, she has written two books and many essays on American, English, and Jewish American writers. She is the editor of The Cambridge History of Jewish American Literature (2015) and the co-editor (with Michael P. Kramer) of The Cambridge Companion to Jewish American Literature (2003). She is the co-creator and academic co-director of the annual Yiddish summer program at Tel Aviv University. Family and early life She was born in Munich, Germany, to Shmuel Brostlavsky (Polish: Wroclawski), a Polish Jew, and his wife, originally from Germany. This was the second marriage for both her parents: her father's first wife and son had been killed by the Nazis in Sieradz, Poland, and her mother's first husband had succumbed to typhoid fever after the couple had been deported to a Siberian labor camp. Her parents met in Uzbekistan and resided in Munich from 1945 to 1949 while awaiting a visa to the United States. While her father never spoke about his experiences during the war, Hana later learned that he had been caught trying to cross the Russian border with his brother and his brother's son, and the Nazis had forced him to play his violin while they massacred Jews. Until his death in 1977, he was frequently hospitalized for severe depression and other mental illnesses. In 1949, at age one, Hana immigrated to the United States with her parents. There, they shortened their surname to Wirth and settled in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where her father worked in a factory that produced women's and children's clothing. At first they lived in a non-Jewish neighborhood, where Hana was the only Jew in her school and swastikas were daubed on their house. When she was 12, her family moved to a Jewish neighborhood, but were ostracized because they were Holocaust survivors. As a result, Hana \\"never felt really American\\". Although she later emigrated to Israel, she does not \\"feel Israeli\\" either. Education and teaching career She earned her bachelor's degree in English with honors from the University of Pennsylvania in 1970. She then studied for her master's degree, master of philosophy, and PhD in English and comparative literature at Columbia University, completing her education in 1977. She was one of the last doctoral students of American literary critic Lionel Trilling. She engaged in post-doctoral research at the Uriel Weinreich Yiddish Language and Literature Program at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research from 1978 to 1979. From 1976 to 1981 she was an assistant professor of English at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, and an associate professor from 1981 to 1984. In 1984 she immigrated to Israel, where she became a senior lecturer at Tel Aviv University for the next 10 years. She became an associate professor in 1994. Concurrently, she chaired the Department of English from 1985 to 1990 and from 1993 to 1997. In 2004 she became a full professor of English and American Studies at Tel Aviv University, a position she holds to the present day. Since 1998, she is the Samuel L. and Perry Haber Chair on the Study of the Jewish Experience in the United States, and since 2005, she is the Director of the Goldreich Family Institute for Yiddish Language, Literature, and Culture. She was a Fulbright visiting professor at Tel Aviv University from 1982 to 1983, and has also been a visiting professor at the University of Konstanz (Summer 1998 and 2000), Johns Hopkins University (Fall 2001), and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (February 2007). She has guest lectured at numerous universities and colleges across the United States, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Northwestern, Dartmouth, University of California at Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Rutgers, New York University, and City University of New York. Literary scholar Wirth-Nesher grew up with her father reading to her in Yiddish, her mother and grandmother speaking to her in German, and her friends conversing with her in English. This personal experience with language led her to learn Yiddish \\"for herself\\" and to teach American and English literature at the university level. She has written many articles and essays on important writers of American and English literature, including Charles Dickens, Henry James, James Joyce, Mark Twain, Virginia Woolf, along with writers of Jewish American literature such as Sholem Aleichem, Saul Bellow, Cynthia Ozick, Henry Roth, Philip Roth, and Isaac Bashevis Singer. Other activities Wirth-Nesher was the associate editor of Prooftexts: A Journal of Jewish Literary History from 1981 to 2004. She was also a consulting editor for The Posen Library of Jewish Culture and Civilization, volume 10. =Yiddish summer program= In 2005, as director of the newly formed Goldreich Family Institute for Yiddish Language, she co- created an annual Yiddish summer program at Tel Aviv University in conjunction with the Beth Shalom Aleichem cultural center. Wirth-Nesher and Professor Avraham Novershtern of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Beth Shalom Aleichem co-direct the academic program, which offers 80 hours of intensive Yiddish language instruction.

Life-threatening hazards include \\"extremely difficult, long, and very violent rapids with highly congested routes\\". Soggy Sneakers warns that the entire run requires scouting, that the route through the Middle Fork Gorge cannot be portaged, that rescue conditions are not favorable, and that the stream is unrunable in low water. Tributaries and diversions Named tributaries of the Middle Fork Rogue River from source to mouth are Honeymoon, Halifax, Bessie, Twentynine, Svinth, Daniel, and Red Blanket Creeks. In addition, water from the Middle Fork is diverted to a Rogue River dam and reservoir at Prospect that impounds water from the Rogue and nearby streams and diverts it to power plants. PacifiCorp operates this system, called The Prospect Nos. 1, 2, and 4 Hydroelectric Project. Built in pieces between 1911 and 1944, it includes separate diversion dams on the Middle Fork Rogue River and Red Blanket Creek, and a water-transport system of canals, flumes, pipes, and penstocks.

During his almost 40-year career, he shot over 60 feature films, as well as several film shorts and serials. In the 1950s, he transitioned to the smaller screen, where he was most well known for his work on the iconic television show, Perry Mason from the end of the 1950s through 1965. Career =Early career= Redman began his career in film as the cinematographer for the 1927 Path√© Exchange serial, Hawk of the Hills, starring Allene Ray and Walter Miller, and directed by Spencer Gordon Bennet. In 1929, Redman shot another serial western, A Final Reckoning, directed by Ray Taylor, this time at Universal Pictures. 1929 also saw Redman's first feature length credit, when the ten episode serial, Hawk of the Hills, was re-edited and re-issued. During his early years, he was sometimes assisted by another pioneering cinematographer, Linwood G. Dunn. In 1931, Redman began a long association with RKO Pictures, working as one of the cameramen under Edward Cronjager, on the Academy Award-winning film, Cimarron. He spent the next several years working as a cameraman for RKO, working on such films as: Consolation Marriage, under J. Roy Hunt, which starred Irene Dunne; Little Orphan Annie, starring Mitzi Green in the title role, with Jack MacKenzie as the director of photography; Bed of Roses (1933), directed by Gregory La Cava and starring Constance Bennett; the 1934 comedy mystery Murder on the Blackboard, directed by George Archainbaud, starring Edna May Oliver and James Gleason, with Nicholas Musuraca in charge of photography; he'd again work with Musuraca on 1935's Village Tale. Redman was also the cameraman, under director of photography Charles Rosher, for the 1932 classic drama about Hollywood, What Price Hollywood?, directed by George Cukor and produced by David O. Selznick and Pandro Berman. The film stars Constance Bennett and Lowell Sherman, and would serve as the basis for Selznick's more famous, A Star is Born The end of 1937 saw Redman get his chance to be the lead photographer on a film. On Lew Landers' comedy, Crashing Hollywood (released in January 1938), he was co- director of photography with Murusaca. That same year, Redman was the D.P. on Fugitives for a Night, starring Frank Albertson, Eleanor Lynn, Allan Lane, and directed by Leslie Goodwins from a screenplay by Dalton Trumbo. Also in 1938, Redman was given the chance to be the director of photography on Little Orphan Annie, a film he had worked on as a cameraman in 1932. This version was directed by Ben Holmes and stars Ann Gillis. On the 1938 romantic comedy Maid's Night Out, directed by Ben Holmes and starring Joan Fontaine and Allan Lane was praised for using their \\"lights and lenses to the fullest advantage.\\" That same year, his work on The Saint in New York starring Louis Hayward, which he was the co-cinematographer with Joseph August, was credited as \\"furnish[ing] exceptional photography.\\" The following year, he was the cinematographer on another Saint picture, The Saint Strikes Back, this time starring George Sanders in the title role. In 1939, he also helmed the camera on Career, with a screenplay by Dalton Trumbo, and starring Anne Shirley and Edward Ellis. Career was one of two films in 1939 where Redman replaced future Oscar-winning cinematographer, Russell Metty, behind the camera, the other being Bad Lands. He closed the year out as the cinematographer on the drama, Two Thoroughbreds, directed by Jack Hively, and starring Jimmy Lydon and Joan Leslie. =1940s= In 1940's You'll Find Out, starring Kay Kyser, Redman's work was lauded as \\"well‚Äîand spookily‚Äîdone.\\" The spooky comment was referring to the genre of the film. That year he would also shoot the action film, The Marines Fly High, starring Richard Dix, Chester Morris and Lucille Ball; before being behind the camera for yet another Saint film, The Saint Takes Over, again with Sanders in the title role, and with Jack Hively at the helm. Redman would team again with Hively later that year, this time on the sequel to Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Windy Poplars, again starring Anne Shirley. Redman's final film of the year was the musical Too Many Girls, starring an all-star cast, which included Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, who met while working on this picture. In 1941, Redman shot Look Who's Laughing, which was produced and directed by Allan Dwan, and stars Edgar Bergen, Lucille Ball, Jim Jordan, and Marian Jordan. Later that year Redman would again film Kay Kyser, this time in Playmates, which also stars John Barrymore. 1942 saw Redman film several notable pictures. The first was the musical Sing Your Worries Away, starring Buddy Ebsen and June Havoc, which was followed by Powder Town, a comedy directed by Rowland V. Lee, and starring Edmond O'Brien and Victor McLaglen. He was teamed with Dwan again later in 1942 on another film starring Edgar Bergen, Here We Go Again, before ending the year with The Great Gildersleeve. In 1943 Redman learned the craft film noir, filming This Land Is Mine, directed by Jean Renoir, and starring Charles Laughton, Maureen O'Hara, and George Sanders; for which The Film Daily said his camerawork was one of the film's many assets. His next film was The Falcon in Danger, starring Tom Conway, which was followed by the gangster comedy Petticoat Larceny, directed by Ben Holmes. Redman's work in the romantic comedy, A Lady Takes a Chance (1943), starring John Wayne and Jean Arthur, was singled out for its quality. His following effort, Government Girl, starring Olivia de Havilland and Sonny Tufts, was also cited for his fine work behind the camera. A Night of Adventure, a 1944 crime drama starring Tom Conway was Redman's first effort in 1944, which he followed up with his next entry into the \\"Falcon\\" series, The Falcon in Mexico, again starring Conway, for which Redman's camerawork received praise. Redman shot half a dozen films the following year, the first of which was Having Wonderful Crime, a mystery comedy starring Pat O'Brien, George Murphy, and Carole Landis. In 1945, Redman also filmed the last ever pairing of Donald O'Connor and Peggy Ryan, in the drama, Patrick the Great. Man Alive, a comedy starring Pat O'Brien, Adolphe Menjou, and Rudy Vallee, was also filmed by Redman during 1945, as was Sing Your Way Home (1945), starring Jack Haley and Marcy McGuire; 1945 also saw Redman shoot the first film in the RKO franchise, Dick Tracy. The nine films he shot in 1946 included The Falcon's Alibi, the ninth film in the franchise; The Truth About Murder, a mystery film directed by Lew Landers; Step by Step, starring Lawrence Tierney, Anne Jeffreys, and Lowell Gilmore; and Criminal Court (1946), directed by Academy Award-winning director, Robert Wise, and starring Tom Conway and Martha O'Driscoll. In 1947 Redman filmed Beat the Band, starring Frances Langford, and two more installments in the Dick Tracy franchise: Dick Tracy's Dilemma and Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome. In 1948 Redman was the cinematographer on two films: the comedy If You Knew Susie, starring Eddie Cantor and Joan Davis; and the film noir, Shed No Tears, directed by Jean Yarbrough. In 1949, Redman was the cinematographer for Ladies of the Chorus, directed by Phil Karlson, and featuring Marilyn Monroe in her first starring role =1950s and transition into television= Redman was not very active during the 1950s. He worked on only three films during the early part of the decade, one in each of the first three years of the decade. His final effort on the big screen was the 1952 action film, The Pace That Thrills, also marking the end of his long association with RKO, which began in 1931. Redman transitioned into television in 1956, shooting two episodes of the Zane Grey Theatre. He would finish his career working on the small screen. In 1956, he would rejoin Nick Murusaca as one of the directors of photography on the sitcom, Hey, Jeannie!. In 1957 Redman was chosen to film the last television play written by Paddy Chayefsky, \\"The Great American Hoax\\", on The 20th Century Fox Hour. He would see his greatest success on television with his work on the television show Perry Mason, which helped cement the film noir feeling of the show. Redman's final work was on the classic television comedy, Hogan's Heroes in 1965.

Route description View south along U.S. Highway 287 in Larimer County, Colorado Heading from the Oklahoma border, US 287 and US 385, upon entering the state, pass through Campo, and make an interchange with US 160 south of Springfield. In Lamar and Carlton, the highways split at an interchange with US 50, where US 287 continues north, this time concurrent with US 50. Just outside the town the highways make a sharp turn toward the west, and the road heading north is SH 196. South of Wiley, US 50 heads west, while US 287 turns north toward Wiley. East of Eads, Colorado US 287 turns toward the west again, briefly merging with SH 96. In Eads SH 96 continues west, while US 287 moves north. Just east of Kit Carson, US 287 again turns toward the west and merges with US 40. East of Limon, the two highways make two interchanges with I-70 before entering Limon. After a brief concurrency with US 24, the two highways merge with I-70. Near the outskirts of Aurora US 36 merges with the group of highways as well. Kiowa County Just past E-470, I-70 and US 36 split to follow a more northerly course, while US 287 and US 40 continue west into Downtown Denver on Colfax Avenue. The I-25, US 6, US 87, and US 85 interchange marks US 287's second junction with its parent route, US 87. Shortly thereafter, at a cloverleaf interchange with Federal Boulevard, SH 88 runs south, US 40 continues west, and US 287 turns north on Federal Boulevard. After crossing I-76 and then US 36 for a second time, US 287 turns west onto 120th Avenue where it overlaps SH 128. Just before meeting US 36 again in Broomfield, US 287 bends back to the north, leaving CO 128 to continues west. At Baseline Road in Lafayette, SH 7 joins US 287 for about a mile, before it splits to the west on Arapahoe Avenue towards Boulder. US 287 intersects SH 119 as it enters Longmont on the very busy Main Street, then intersects SH 66 at the north edge of town. The road bypasses Berthoud en route to Loveland, where US 287 splits into the pair of one-way streets. US 287 passes through Fort Collins on College Avenue, merging with SH 14 at Jefferson Street. On the edge of the mountains, SH 14 splits and heads west into Poudre Canyon, while US 287 continues north into Wyoming. The section of US 287 between Fort Collins, Colorado and Laramie, Wyoming carries very heavy truck traffic and was once considered dangerous. History The original US 287 only traveled from Denver past the Wyoming state line in 1935. In 1940, US 287 was expanded past the Oklahoma state line (to Port Arthur, Texas), replacing US 285. After a head-on crash on the highway in 2001, there were people lobbying for a widening of US 287 at the Wyoming state line. Their request was answered in April 2009. Throughout 2012, the highway was expanded to three lanes north of Fort Collins, was resurfaced, and contained shoulders to prevent such accidents.

Nose-blowing is the act of expelling nasal mucus by exhaling forcefully through the nose. This is usually done into a facial tissue or handkerchief, facial tissues being more hygienic as they are disposed of after each use while handkerchiefs are softer, environmentally-friendly and more stylish. Nose-blowing may be used to alleviate nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (runny nose) resulting from colds or seasonal allergies.  Technique  The tissue or handkerchief is held gently against the nose. Prior to nose blowing, a deep inhale through the mouth provides the air required to eject the nasal mucus. Exhaling hard through both nostrils at once will effectively eject the mucus. The process may need to be repeated several times to sufficiently clear the entire nose.  Health effects  While nose-blowing helps to alleviate symptoms of the common cold and hayfever, the blowing of a nose, when it is done excessively or incorrectly, may bring potential adverse health effects. Nose-blowing generates high pressure in the nostrils. When this pressure is added to a dry nose, it could rupture blood vessels inside the nose, resulting in a nosebleed. In a 2000 study, doctors squirted dense liquid dye, which could be seen on x-rays, into the noses of several adult volunteers. The volunteers were induced to sneeze, cough, and blow their noses. It was found that the typical pressure of nose-blowing was 1.3 pounds per square inch, ten times greater than that generated by sneezing or coughing. CT scans showed that nose blowing sent much of the dye into the paranasal sinuses rather than expelling it out the nose. The doctors suspected that nose-blowing may increase the risk of sinus infections by sending bacteria-filled mucus into the sinuses. In extremely rare but documented cases, nose-blowing has resulted in unusual conditions, such as in the case of a woman who fractured her left eye socket after blowing her nose.  Etiquette  Nose-blowing becomes a breach of etiquette if it is performed directly in front of someone at a dining table or in a lobby. When nose-blowing needs to be carried out at the table, the person doing it should turn away from everybody else and especially away from food on the table. If the nose-blowing session is going to be short, then it could be done at the table, but if the nose is too stuffed and the resulting nose- blowing session will be long and loud, then it is strongly cautioned to go to the restroom/washroom. It is also rude to continuously snort mucus back into the nose. It is better to leave for the restroom/washroom and clean it up. In this regard, carrying handkerchief everyday with you would be a better option than running short of tissues.

In 1930 medical researchers captured Syrian hamster breeding stock for animal testing. Further domestication led this animal to become a popular pet. The Syrian hamster's natural habitat is in a small region of Northwest Syria near the city of Aleppo. It was first described by science in the 1797 second edition of The Natural History of Aleppo, a book written and edited by two Scottish physicians living in Syria. The Syrian hamster was first recognized as a distinct species in 1839. In 1930, a scientist seeking animal subjects for medical research had the first Syrian hamsters captured to become laboratory animals. Scientists bred those hamsters and during the 1930s sent their descendants to various other laboratories around the world. By the late 1940s in the United States, a commercial hamster industry had begun to provide hamsters for laboratory use and at the same time to popularize hamsters as pets. In later years, further expeditions back to Syria captured other hamsters to increase genetic diversity among the populations of hamsters shared among breeders. Wild Syrian hamsters become tame in a matter of days after being captured and handled by humans. Wild hamsters are quick to adapt to captivity and thrive in a laboratory setting. Cataloging as a species Patrick Russell, who provided the first written description of the hamster in the 1797 edition of The Natural History of Aleppo The earliest known publication describing the Syrian hamster was in Patrick Russell's 1797 revision and second edition of his half-brother Alexander Russell's 1756 The Natural History of Aleppo. Alexander Russell was a Scottish physician who had been living in Syria from 1740 till 1750 or 55, and while in Aleppo, he documented the natural history of the region.The Murphy source says 1750 and the Munk source seems to say 1755. Patrick Russell moved to Aleppo in 1750 and stayed there till 1781, and like his brother documented natural history. It is uncertain which brother wrote the description of the hamster for the book. Perhaps Patrick took it from Alexander's unpublished notes or perhaps it was Patrick's own addition to the book in the second edition. In the Russell's book, the Syrian hamster is referenced as \\"Mus Cricetus Linn. S.N. p 82: Hamster, Buffon (H.N. XIII. p177)\\", which means that the Russells incorrectly cataloged the Syrian hamster to be the same species as the European hamster as described by the Comte de Buffon and Carl Linnaeus. George Robert Waterhouse, who in 1839 first described the Syrian hamster as its own species In 1839 at a meeting of the London Zoological Society George Robert Waterhouse described the Syrian hamster as a new species. His identification of the animal happened after his 1835 appointment as a curator of the museum of the London Zoological Society, where his job was to process mammal specimens. The body in the museum became the type specimen for the new species. There is no record of who collected the specimen nor is there any record of who donated the body to that museum. In 1853 the British Museum purchased the collections of the London Zoological Society, so now, this original hamster is in the British Museum as specimen BM(NH) 1855.12.24.120. Some derivative works of the Waterhouse publication which also presented the existence of the hamster were Louis Fraser's 1849 Zoologia Typica, Christoph Gottfried Andreas Giebel's 1855 S√§ugetiere, and Henry Baker Tristram's 1884 Fauna and Flora of Palestine. In 1902 Alfred Nehring studied a preserved female Syrian hamster specimen at the Beirut Museum.Smith 2012 p. 747, citing * In 1898 he defined and established the genus Mesocricetus and redefined the Syrian hamster as Mesocricetus auratus.Murphy 1985 p.7 seems unaware of this, saying there is no new publication on the Syrian hamster till Adler. Publication in 1940 confirmed that Mesocricetus was a well-characterized genus different from Cricetus.Smith 2012 p.747 says this, but attributes it to a 1940 Ellerman paper that he saw in this source. * \\"H Granados\\" must be \\"Humberto Granados\\". More research might identify Ellerman or find the 1940 paper. Capture of live hamsters Israel Aharoni, who directed the capture of the first Syrian hamsters to be bred in captivity After Waterhouse identified the hamster there seems to be no original scientific study of the Syrian hamster until 1930. In 1930, Israel Aharoni captured the first live hamsters known to science and in 1942 published his notes and a narrative of the experience in an autobiography, Memoirs of a Hebrew Zoologist (◊ñ◊õ◊®◊ï◊†◊ï◊™ ◊ñ◊ï◊ê◊ï◊ú◊ï◊í ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô). Sometime before Aharoni's 1930 hamster expedition, parasitologist Saul Adler was having trouble doing his research because of lack of animal testing subjects. Leishmaniasis was a regional problem and it was common to infect Chinese hamsters as a model organism to study the disease. However, he was having problem breeding those hamsters in captivity, and had difficulty also getting regular shipments of Chinese hamsters from China. Because of these problems, he wished to find a Middle Eastern hamster that would be easy to capture locally and have potential in animal testing. Adler may or may not have known of the existence of the Syrian hamster from the Waterhouse publication or others copying information from that work. Whatever he knew, he contacted Israel Aharoni for advice, as both were researchers at Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Aharoni was the head of the zoology department. Aharoni already knew of the Syrian hamster and when he made his plan to respond to Adler's request, he planned to capture Syrian hamsters and provide them to Adler. Aharoni took assistance from a local Syrian guide, Georgius Khalil Tah'an, who on his behalf got information from a local leader Sheik El-Beled about where hamsters might be found. On 12 April 1930, the sheik called Aharoni and Georgius to a meeting which led to the capture of hamsters and which Aharoni described as follows: After starting with a mother and 11 babies, Aharoni was left with 10. At the time of capture the babies' eyes were not yet opened due to their age. Aharoni and his wife cared for the hamsters as they carried them back to the university. Somehow before returning the hamsters to the university, all of the hamsters escaped, and when Aharoni recovered them, one had escaped permanently leaving 9 babies. Aharoni delivered these to Heim Ben- Menachen, who was the head of the Hebrew University animal facilities and that department's founder. Ben-Menachen put the hamsters in a wooden box on the floor, and Aharoni recorded this account of what happened next: The most thorough search was unable to find the escaped hamsters, leaving three females and a male. Murphy 1985, p. 12 says that three males and one female is most likely based on the written record. *In Memoirs (1942), Aharoni says 3 males and 1 female, which conflicts with his own earlier notes and a report from Adler. *Unpublished Aharoni 1932 notes and the 1948 Adler Nature article say that there were 3 females and 1 male, and that the male killed one of the females. :: *Murphy 1985, p. 17 says that there were only 3 hamster siblings, but he does not clarify gender because he already says there was ambiguity. *There is agreement that there were three hamsters. Sources are not in agreement as to the gender mix. The male hamster then killed one of the females. Aharoni doubted that the remaining hamsters would breed. Ben-Menachen tried a new breeding technique, described as follows: Aharoni wrote this conclusion: Within one year, these three hamster siblings were the origin of a colony of 150 hamsters. Adler was the first recipient of hamsters from this colony. Adler and another scientist published the first research using Syrian hamsters in 1931.This is the paper. \\"Kala Azar\\" is visceral leishmaniasis. * Adler was known for his generosity and modesty and often did not make a record of his work, so some of what happened next is uncertain. Aharoni made no mention of further hamster expeditions in his memoir, but the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde has three female hamster specimens in their collection attributed to him and noted as having been caught 27 and 29 April 1930. Establishment in laboratories Medical researcher Saul Adler shared Syrian hamsters with other medical researchers, establishing the animal internationally. =Israel= Among his many scientific projects and recognition, Saul Adler took particular pleasure in distributing Syrian hamsters to researchers in other laboratories. His motivation was the usefulness of the hamster and because he recognized the fragile nature of the single colony. =United Kingdom= In 1931 Adler did wildlife smuggling of hamsters through customs into England by hiding them in his coat pockets.Murphy 1985, p. 13 says he learned this from Adler in personal communication. Also this is told in * He gave the hamsters to Edward Hindle, then of the London Zoological Society, who himself established a colony for researchers. The hamsters eventually came to the laboratory of Leonard Goodwin whose hamsters became the stock of pet hamsters in the UK. =United States= There is agreement that Syrian hamsters must have come to the United States in 1938. Beyond that, it is unclear how many colonies of hamsters came, why they were sent, or where they went. The available evidence identifies three colonies of hamsters arriving in that year, with two colonies said to have come from Saul Adler, and another colony which could have come from him or otherwise which came from Israel Jacob Kligler, who himself got his hamsters from Adler. In 1939 scientists at Case Western Reserve University published a paper on inoculating Syrian hamsters with leprosy, and in that paper, they said, \\"Our original colony of 13 animals was secured from stock at the Hebrew University on July 26, 1938 through the kindness of Dr. Adler.\\"Murphy 1985, p. 13 cites this paper * There are records that Guy Henry Faget of the United States Public Health Service in Carville, Louisiana received a shipment of Syrian hamsters from Adler in 1938. Faget's laboratory has notes that they received 12 hamsters in July 1938, and another record says that both Adler sent both Faget and Case Western similar shipments of hamsters at the same time. A 1950 publication says that two shipments of hamsters arrived to America in 1938, one to Case Western and the other to Rockefeller Foundation.Murphy 1985, p. 14 says this and notes this book. * In 1940 and 41 the Rockefeller Foundation and one of its partner laboratories in Berkeley published several papers based on Syrian hamsters as test subjects, so definitely they had hamsters at that time.Murphy 1985, p. 14 lists these as early research using the Syrian hamster as a test subject.   * In 1948 Adler wrote that before World War II he sent hamsters to India and that Kligler sent animals to America. Since in other notes Adler is known to have sent two colonies to America but not more than that, the available information suggests that the hamsters to Rockefeller came from Kligler and the others were the shipment from Adler. Hamsters in the United States may have all proliferated from these three colonies. Popularization as pets =United Kingdom= In 1880 as British Consul to Syria James Henry Skene was retiring back to Edinburgh, he returned from Syria with Syrian hamsters. He died in 1886. The colony of hamsters remained alive until 1910. When Adler's hamsters passed through the laboratory of Leonard Goodwin, those hamsters became the stock of pet hamsters in the UK. From the UK these hamsters also spread throughout Europe. =United States= This advertisement from Gulf Hamstery appeared in numerous popular science magazines around 1948‚Äì1951. Albert Marsh of Mobile, Alabama established the commercial hamster industry in the United States in the 1940s. Marsh first got a hamster when he was gambling and won it in a wager. Somehow he got more hamsters after this one, perhaps from the breeding stock managed by Guy Henry Faget in Carville, Louisiana. At the time, Marsh was a highway engineer but unemployed. After getting his hamsters, he learned to breed them and founded Marsh Enterprises and the Gulf Hamstery, which promoted Syrian hamsters as pets, for laboratory use, and in business schemes. Marsh took advertisements in magazines, comics, and livestock trade journals which praised hamsters as pets and presented the idea that breeding hamsters was a good business investment. In his business, he shipped hamsters to people who would be breeders, then he coordinated the shipment of various breeders' hamsters to other breeders or to laboratories. Marsh was successful in part because of the professionalism he brought to the art of hamster husbandry. He authored a book, The Hamster Manual, which had a distribution of 80,000 copies by its 6th edition in 1951. In 1946, Marsh began a campaign to legalize the ownership of hamsters in California, which were prohibited. On 10 February 1948, with the help of the governor of Alabama and others, Marsh was successful in convincing the California State Department of Agriculture to designate Syrian hamsters as \\"normally domesticated animals\\". The hamstery business peaked from 1948-1951 then profitability dropped to almost nothing in the early 1950s. The market changed when small hamsteries, most of which started with hamsters from Marsh, became available everywhere and satisfied local demand for pet hamsters. Marsh's Gulf Hamstery closed in the 1950s.

History  In 1923, Albert Prouvost, a sponsor and patron of FC Roubaix, decided to and financed the construction of a new stadium with 2,000 covered seats, which hosted the football team of the club, but also tennis, bocce, gymnastics, table tennis and basketball. Officially opened in September 1927, the Stade Am√©d√©e-Prouvost then becomes one of the best enclosures in the region. In 1929, the stadium was the scene of the tumultuous arrival of the Paris-Roubaix cycling race: with a cendree track it turns out that the stadium is not at all suited to cycling. In the final sprint involving three competitors, the big favorite, Belgian Georges Ronsse, slips and breaks his wheel while he is in the lead, leaving the victory to his compatriot Charles Meunier. Dissatisfied, the public invades the track and the sprint for fourth place is canceled. The press was very critical, so that the race was not run there again.Des lieux charg√©s d'histoire, ville-wattrelos.fr ; qui cite Un si√®cle de Paris-Roubaix 1896-1996, Pascal Sergent, √©d.

The CORT had a thunderous debut in the championship of France: 3rd in the first division in 1946, it won the national title in 1947. The club is unfortunately relegated to the second division in 1955 after a poor season. After another relegation in 1963, the professional status of the club was abandoned. In 1966 the premier covered gallery is closed. The club finally ceased operations June 15, 1970, when it had been in the France Amateurs Championship, the third tier of French football.

It was built from 1943 to 1959. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  41st Infantry Division plaque St Christopher's Chapel at Nerimbera was erected in 1943 by the American 542 Engineers, Ship and Shore Battalion. The timber and stone chapel was built on Harbour Board land made available to the U.S. Army by the Queensland Government. It reflects the presence of American troops in Queensland during the Second World War and stands as the only structure of its kind in Australia. The area around the chapel had been used as a convalescent camp for American troops based around Rockhampton, and other U.S. units which had been sent to Rockhampton to rest after combat operations in the Pacific islands. During the peak time of American occupation more than 70 000 American soldiers from the 24th, 32nd and 41st U.S. Army combat divisions, and One Army Corps - \\"1 Corps\\", were stationed in the Rockhampton area. In 1943 several army chaplains recognised the need for a non-denominational chapel, and approached the Corps Commander for assistance. The 542 Engineers Ship and Shore were given the task of constructing the chapel under the supervision of the chaplains. The timber roof trusses and the stones used in construction were collected from the surrounding area. When the work was completed late in 1943, the four chaplains (two Protestant, one Roman Catholic and one Jewish Rabbi) consecrated the chapel as a place of divine worship where non-denominational services could be held. After the United States troops left in February 1944 there was a gradual deterioration in the building until Henry Beak, whose grazing property adjoined the chapel, began to take care of it in July 1947. From mid 1955 the Livingstone Shire and Rockhampton City Councils assumed responsibility for the chapel. In 1958, Master Sergeant Jack Bauman, U.S. Army, returned to Rockhampton and attempted to raise funds for the restoration of the chapel. Jack Bauman died before funds were raised but the 41st Division in America forwarded $130 to the American 41st Division Association in Rockhampton to paint the chapel. An octagonal band rotunda was erected in honour of Master Sergeant Bauman adjacent to the chapel. In 1959 vandals destroyed a number of articles in the chapel which precipitated the formation of a committee and the appointment of trustees from the R.S.S.A.I.L.A. and the 41st Division Association to preserve and maintain the chapel. The committee established an annual service held on the Sunday closest to 4 July, American Independence Day. During the time the committee looked after the chapel the memorial fence was erected with each donor's name engraved on a stainless steel panel. The lower gates were donated by the R.S.S.A.I.L.A. Rockhampton Branch and the main gates were a gift from Henry Beak. The signs commemorating athletic events, which are located around the sides of the chapel, are mementos collected from a sports oval which was located near the chapel and used by the troops during their occupation. These signs were placed in the chapel by Henry Beak. In 1986 the committee dissolved, at which time the R.S.L. was approached to be the new caretakers for the chapel. The chapel is now under the authority of the Livingstone Shire Council and is a public place.  Description  Chapel entrance, 2009 St Christopher's Chapel is located fronting St Christopher's Chapel Road, Nerimbera, to the southeast of Rockhampton. The site is located on the southeastern side of low hill, and the entrance to the chapel faces in an easterly direction. The single storeyed open-sided chapel has a concrete base, and is constructed of undressed timber posts and beams supporting king post trusses with struts and a ribbed metal gable roof. The chapel is open at the front and to both sides, with a low random rubble stone wall to the perimeter. The low stone wall has a central opening at the front, and returns either side of concrete steps which provide access to the chapel from the entrance path. The gable end has fibrous cement sheeting with timber battens, and a cross of undressed timber at the apex. The entrance is flanked by two marble plaques; the southern plaque commemorates the maintenance of the chapel by the Returned Services League of Australia, and the northern plaque commemorates the erection of the chapel in 1943 by the United States 542nd Special Engineer Regiment. Recessed altar with rose window, 2009 The rear of the structure has a raised platform separated from the body of the chapel by timber altar rails. A random rubble stone wall to the underside of the roof trusses creates a recessed central altar with a door to either side accessing rear side rooms. The altar has a central rose window consisting of coloured glass in a fretwork frame, below which is a large shelf surmounting a marble cross set in the stone wall. A free-standing random rubble pulpit is located at the southern side of the altar. The rear side rooms are enclosed with fibrous cement sheeting, and each has a sash window at the rear and a door opening onto a recessed porch behind the altar. The northern room contains a commemorative plaque fixed to the side wall. Timber pews, 2009 The chapel has a wide centre aisle with timber pews to either side. The struts to alternate roof trusses have been painted in red, white and blue, and the Australian and American coat of arms are depicted on panels fixed to the roof truss above the altar rails. Timber planks displaying American servicemen's athletic records have been attached to the upper section of both sides of the chapel. An octagonal band rotunda is located on the northern side of the chapel. This structure has a concrete and random rubble stone base, and is constructed of undressed timber posts and rafters, with sawn cross members, supporting a pitched ribbed metal roof. The rotunda is open to each side, with concrete steps providing access from the eastern side. A low timber bench seat is located around the perimeter, and timber pews have been placed in the rotunda facing the adjacent chapel altar. A stone plaque fixed to the stone base commemorates the erection of the rotunda. The entrance to the chapel is via commemorative metal gates and arch, with the name SAINT CHRISTOPHERS CHAPEL outlined in large metal lettering, fronting a parking area off St Christopher's Chapel Road. Similar gates are located at the southern end of the site. The entrance path is lined by a number of commemorative plaques fixed to stone cairns, and garden beds with stone borders are located adjacent. The site also includes many trees scattered around the vicinity of the chapel.  Heritage listing  St Christophers Chapel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Christopher's Chapel, erected in 1943, reflects the presence of American troops in Queensland during the Second World War. The area surrounding Rockhampton had sustained around 70 000 US soldiers who were fighting in the Pacific, and this non-denominational chapel was constructed to service the religious needs of those troops.

In the past, he was a guest researcher at the Dudman Lab at The Janelia Farm Research Campus Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). Research After completing his dissertation, Zemelman began working in the laboratory of James Rothman on SNARE proteins and their influence on the intracellular membrane fusion. Subsequently, Zemelman worked jointly with Gero Miesenb√∂ck to perform seminal experiments in 2002 and 2003 on selective stimulation of neurons using light, a field that came to be known as optogenetics. These techniques were later improved by Karl Deisseroth in 2005; these pioneering studies in optogenetics led to these three scientists being regarded as candidates for the Nobel Prize in 2013. In 2015 Zemelman and his colleagues received three grants totaling $4 million, to develop techniques for imaging and manipulating the activity of neurons in the brain. The grants were made through Barack Obama's Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative launched in 2014.

The tour operator is connected to the international Globus Travel Group, founded in 1928, which remains family owned with headquarters in Lugano, Switzerland. Under parent company Cosmos Tours Ltd, the tour operator offers holidays through two brands: Cosmos and Avalon Waterways. Cosmos Holidays was founded in 1961 as Cosmos Tours. It became Cosmos Holidays in 1987. After Globus Travel Group sold Monarch Travel Group to Greybull Capital in October 2014,http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/25/uk-monarch-m-a-greybull- idUKKCN0IE09N20141025 Monarch stopped using Cosmos as a Monarch Group brand in 2015. However, in March 2017 it was announced that Cosmos Tours had regained full rights and licences to the Cosmos brand and Monarch would change its corporate name from Cosmos Holidays Limited to Monarch Holidays Limited.http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/articles/275097/cosmos-brand- relinquished-by-monarch Background Origins of Cosmos (1928‚Äì1986)  In 1928, Antonio Mantegazza started a company specialising in coach touring called Globus Viaggi. The company began with a fleet of 12 coaches which operated local excursions for European tourists in Switzerland. By 1950, Globus Viaggi had grown to a fleet of 33 coaches and featured overnight excursions to Rome, Venice, the Dolomites and the French Riviera. Gradually these became regular scheduled tours and grew longer to cover more ground. Later that decade Globus pioneered the concept of Grand European Touring by offering first-class European tours to North Americans. Cosmos Tours was founded in the UK in 1961 by Sergio Mantegazza. The company was created to provide British customers with affordable package holidays by coach and air travel to Europe. Destinations included Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and Austria by motor coach from London‚Äôs Victoria station, and by flights from Southend and Lympne airports. Although the company's main programme focused on motor coach tours, it soon increased the choice of air package holidays too. In 1968, the success of the company's air package holidays allowed Cosmos to form the airline Monarch Airlines.\\"World Airline Directory 1968\\". Flight International. March 1968\\"The 40-year-old start-up ‚Äì Monarch Airlines\\", Maslen, R. in Airliner World July 2008, Key Publishing, Stamford, 2008, p. 32 Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Cosmos Tours increased its UK departure airports to include Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh and East Midlands, serving new destinations including Portugal, Yugoslavia, Greece, Malta and Tunisia, and longhaul destinations such as Florida, Thailand and Mexico. In 1986 Cosmos Tours became the first mainstream operator in the UK to launch a Christmas Lapland programme. Expansion (1987‚Äì2009) In 1987, the company changed its name from Cosmos Tours to Cosmos Holidays. In September 1991, the Globus Travel Group acquired 80% of Avro Plc, a flight-only company set up by Paul Dendle. This acquisition enhanced the company‚Äôs charter seat- only presence in the market. In 1994, the Globus Group acquired the remaining 20%. In 1994, Cosmos launched a direct-sell brand, Archers Direct (later Archers Holidays, shut down in November 2018), featuring a worldwide touring programme. In 2002, Cosmos launched an accommodation-only brand, somewhere2stay, which supplied hotel, apartment and villa accommodation to the UK travel trade. Four years after launching somewhere2stay, sales made up ¬£20-¬£40 million of an estimated ¬£300-¬£350 million turnover in the accommodation-only sector. During 2006, the decision was made to run somewhere2stay separately from Cosmos Holidays. In 2007, Cosmos announced they would introduce package holidays using Monarch‚Äôs full range of scheduled flights, in line with the expansion plans announced by the airline during the same year.http://www.travelmole.com/news_feature.php?news_id=109424&c;=setreg&region;=3 In 2009, executive chairman, Iain Rawlinson announced plans to reinvent the company as a scheduled carrier, after the company made financial losses. It was predicted at the time that the parent company of Cosmos Holidays would make a loss of around ¬£45 million. During the same year, media coverage suggested there were problems with their approach.http://www.travolution.com/articles/2270/lack-of-retail-shops- remains-achilles-heel-for-cosmos The Mantegazza family from Switzerland, which had owned Group Voyagers since its foundation, invested money into the group to cover the losses.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/swiss-billionaires- bail-out-ailing-monarch-again-0jrz2bwpq63 Consolidation (2014-present) In 2014, the Mantegazza family announced plans to sell Monarch Holdings Ltd. Subsidiaries included Monarch Airlines, Monarch Aircraft Engineering, First Aviation, Cosmos Holidays, somewhere2stay and Avro. On 31 October 2014, the holiday group was sold to venture capitalists, Greybull Capital. Cosmos Tours & Cruises was retained by the Mantegazza Family.https://www.ft.com/content/056824d2-4313-11e4-9a58-00144feabdc0 In 2016, Cosmos introduced a private tour programme based on existing tour itineraries in Asia, Africa and India with a private guide/driver included. From 1 April 2017, the tour operator regained all rights to the brand Cosmos, having reached a formal agreement with Monarch which terminated the licence covering the use of the name. Destinations Cosmos provides tours, cruises and rail journeys in over 40 countries, flying from up to 27 UK airports. The tour operator with its origins in touring in Italy, offers holidays across Europe and the Mediterranean. Other destinations include North America & Canada, Central & South America, Asia and the Far East, Africa, the Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean, Australia and New Zealand. In recent years, river and ocean cruises have been added to the product range of tours.

It is a broom-like shrub with flat, narrow, wrinkled leaves and white or light pink to lilac-coloured flowers.Eremophila caperata habit Description Eremophila caperata is a shrub usually growing to a height of with many erect branches. The branches are rough and often lumpy, shiny and sticky. The leaves are linear in shape, tapering towards both ends and are mostly long and wide. The leaves have a wrinkled surface and there is a slight hook on the end. The flowers are borne in groups of 3 or 4 in leaf axils on a stalk long. There are 5 egg-shaped, cream-coloured to purple, sticky sepals which are long. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is white, light pink to lilac-coloured, spotted brown inside the tube. The inside and outside surfaces are hairy and there are 4 stamens enclosed within the petal tube. Flowering occurs between August and November and is followed by fruit which are oval-shaped, long, with a thin, brittle and hairy covering. Taxonomy and naming Eremophila caperata was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The type specimen was collected by Chinnock about north of the rabbit-proof fence near Kalannie. The specific epithet (caperata) is a Latin word meaning \\"wrinkled\\". Distribution and habitat This eremophila occurs over a wide area between Wubin, Hyden and the Plumridge Lakes area where it grows in sand, clay or loam on dunes and depressions, often in saline soils and in Eucalyptus woodland. Use in horticulture The delicate leaves of E. caperata, its compact shape and masses of showy flowers in spring make this a suitable screening or understorey shrub. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum. It grows in a wide range of soils, in full sun or partial shade and is both frost and drought tolerant.

At the age of twelve, when his condition had improved somewhat, he was apprenticed to his father. A few years later, he enrolled at the Academie Minerva. His training there was interrupted by a recurrence of his disease, which forced him to spend two years in a hospital. At seventeen, he returned to the Academie.Brief biography by Philip van Praag in the Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland @ the International Institute of Social History In 1896, he saw the works of Van Gogh at an exhibition in Groningen, which had a deep and permanent effect on his style. That same year, thanks to a government grant, he enrolled at the \\"Teekenschool voor Kunstambachten\\" in Amsterdam and, after graduating, became a drawing teacher at a technical school. It was then that his growing interest in socialism led him to join the Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP). One of his first projects as a member involved a study of the housing situation in Amsterdam. The result was a 100-page booklet called \\"Krotten en Sloppen\\" (Shacks and Slums), published in 1901, with his drawings. The following year, Het Volk, a socialist newspaper, held a contest to find an artist for their weekly Sunday supplement. Hahn was selected and signed to a permanent contract. Soon, he began creating political cartoons in addition to illustrations; for De Notenkraker as well as Het Volk, and was able to quit his teaching job in 1905. After the beginning of World War I, his works dealt almost exclusively with denouncing the needless death and destruction. Although he had occasional serious relapses, in 1911 he married the recently divorced Iemkje Dijkman, adopted her two sons, and had two daughters. In 1918, just before the end of the war, he succumbed to his disease. Over his career, he produced more than 4,000 drawings.

It is a distance of about 7 miles (12 km) by sea from the island's only settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. There is a beach of black volcanic sand fringed by low cliffs and a sloping plateau leading up to Tristan's mountainous interior. Its climate is warmer and drier than that of the Settlement, being in the lee of the island's prevailing winds. A farm was established in the 1950s, and although attempts to grow vegetables were abandoned, the pine plantation and fruit trees of apple, pear, plum and peach make the area unique. The grassy slopes above the cliffs are grazed by sheep and a herd of about 15 beef cattle.The Tristan da Cunha Website. Sandy Point. There is a colony of Northern rockhopper penguins (known on the island as pinnamins) at the east end of Sandy Point.

The plantation The Sandy Point plantation consists mainly of introduced Monterey pines, a species of tree native to coastal California which is known for its versatile, fast-growing, medium-density softwood. The indigenous Island Cape Myrtle is also present, along with pussy willow, grey poplar and various Eucalyptus species. The impact of invasive trees on Tristan's ecology is potentially large, with the Monterey pine being notably successful in extending its range. There have been efforts to eradicate invasive loganberry from Sandy Point, where it formed a dense undergrowth in the plantation making the area unsuitable for nesting albatrosses and Atlantic petrels. The islanders do not make extensive use of the plantation, preferring to import wood more cheaply from South Africa. However, in the 1980s the Sandy Point Hut was rebuilt by the Agriculture Department, allowing forestry workers to be based there.Niek Gremmen & Ruerdje Lenna Halbertsma.

Biography  Willoughby was born in 1946 in Jackson, Mississippi. She attended the University of Southern Mississippi and received her BFA in fine art and design in 1968. In 1972, she met Milton Glaser at the Aspen Design Conference. At the time, she was thinking of quitting and Glaser advised her to stick with it and in 1974, she started her small design business. This allowed her time for her family and to do the work she wanted to do. She attracted many talented women looking for the flexibility to accommodate life with children, which was unheard of at the time. In 1978, she founded Ann Willoughby & Associates (now Willoughby Design Group) in Kansas City where she has worked with Lee Jeans, Einstein Bros. Bagels, and Hallmark. Her firm still supports young female designers and has worked on a variety of design initiatives. Willoughby received an AIGA medal in 2014.

In 1872, Denver constructed an irrigation ditch that carried water from the Platte River Canyon into Denver.Shu Liu and Linda M. Meyer, \\"Carnations and the Floriculture Industry: Documenting the Cultivation and Marketing of Flowers in Colorado\\", 2007 With this new source of consistent water, growers soon discovered the bright sunny days and virgin soils of Denver were ideal for growing vegetables and cut flowers. Few varieties of carnations were available during those early days and competition was fierce. Many independent growers marketed their carnations through sales outlets in their greenhouses or by selling the mature flowers to retail florists. Growers had to contend with weather extremes that required either charcoal heaters in delivery wagons during winter so the flowers wouldn‚Äôt freeze or battling the often-intense summer heat when the crops could easily wilt. Nonetheless, business flourished. Floral arrangements featuring carnations were a common gift to the women of Denver's tenderloin district as well as high society. The first greenhouse in Denver was constructed in 1891. By 1900, the floral industry had approximately 400,000 square feet of greenhouse glass covering its nurseries.Kingman, Dick (1986) A History ‚Äì Colorado Flower Growers and its People page 12 Colorado Greenhouse Growers Association, Inc. The Riverside Cemetery at 52nd and Brighton Blvd, Mauff Floral Company in the 1200 block of Logan St., established in 1880, Colfax Floral at East Colfax and Josephine, Park Floral at 17th and York, and Curtis Park Floral at 34th and Downing were some of the first establishments dedicated to the public‚Äôs desire for carnations.The American Florist Company's Directory of Florists, Nurserymen and Seedsmen of the United States and Canada, 1910 Colorado's Carnation Gold Rush had begun. A marketing and grading system for carnations was established in the early 1900s. Swedish immigrant and founder of the Denver Wholesale Florist s, N.A. Benson, recognized that Colorado carnations were a valuable commodity that could be marketed nationally. He was instrumental in standardizing prices and insisting on quality from all growers. Around that time, J. Edward Johnson, of the Pikes Peak Floral Company in Colorado Springs began shipping the prized Colorado carnations to neighboring states.Kingman, History ‚Äì Colorado Flower Growers and its People page 14  Later Years  In the fall of 1917, George Brenkert of Washington Park Floral entered his newly developed shell pink carnation called ‚ÄúDenver‚Äù in the Denver Society of Ornamental Horticulturists. While he didn‚Äôt win in that show, the ‚ÄúDenver‚Äù carnation attracted attention and later won a Bronze Medal in the 1921 National Flower Show in Washington, DC. Colorado was becoming known for its thriving carnation and cut flower business.Kingman, A History ‚Äì Colorado Flower Growers and its People , page 22President Elect Harding wore a Colorado carnation in his lapel on his inauguration day. He was carrying on a tradition established by his predecessor, President William McKinley. McKinley always wore a red carnation in his lapel, and ordered fresh carnations to his office daily. McKinley‚Äôs birthday, January 29 is still recognized as the official Carnation Day.Kingman, A History ‚Äì Colorado Flower Growers and its People , page 25 By 1919, the 15th Census of the United States reported that the value of sales for floral crops in Colorado was $1,145,000. From 1925 to 1927 greenhouse space used for plants and flowers more than doubled in the state of Colorado. By 1926, Colorado produced an estimated 8,000,000 blooms of carnations. By 1927, the floriculture industry in Colorado was shipping to 20 states. By that time, there were approximately 5,000,000 square feet of greenhouse glass on operating nurseries in Colorado.The demand for Colorado carnations was growing. Colorado was \\"rapidly becoming recognized as the carnation state\\", because of the excellent quality of the blooms and the fact that they could be produced year round. 1927 was the first year the floriculture industry of Colorado was recognized in the Colorado Year Book published by the Colorado State Planning Division In 1928, Colorado's production of Carnations reached 12,000,000 blooms. 10 states depended entirely on Colorado for their supplies of flowers. By 1929, there were 101 establishments, cultivating 1,582.463 square feet of carnation beds with the annual gross income of the Colorado's Floral industry of approximately $5,000,000 topping the value of metallic gold mined that year in the state. Colorado became famous throughout the country for carnations of \\"brilliant color, unusual size and lasting quality. \\" Colorado carnations made their way to New York, London and Cuba. By 1931, Colorado was considered one of the most important states in the union for the productions of flowers including Carnation, Roses, and Gypsophilia (Baby Breath). Local greenhouses continued to prosper and be built, particularly in the northwest corner of Denver and its suburbs. Wheat Ridge, Colorado still celebrates an annual Carnation Festival. New varieties continued to be developed including the White Ward and Hilda Varieties. The early Denver growers began an industry that would shape Colorado‚Äôs economy and landscape. They helped to establish an orderly system to provide quality cut flowers to the nation and beyond. Some of the Colorado family names associated with the Carnation Gold Rush are Amato, Elitch, Lambourn, Lehrer, Maler, and Spano.

But Gervais was not Dean of Paris; Geoffrey de Bar was, and Geoffrey was a Doctor of Theology.

He was Archdeacon of Le Mans. On 5 August 1279 he was appointed, along with Gaufridus (Geoffroy) de Barro, Dean of Paris, by Cardinal Simon de Brion, Apostolic Legate, to investigate a dispute at the University of Paris, between the Regent Masters in the Faculty of Arts on the one hand, and the Masters in Canon Law and Masters in Medicine on the other. The two appointees were to take testimony, employing canonical penalties for non-cooperation if necessary. They were to transmit their findings under seal to the Cardinal Legate.Henri Denifle, Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis I (Paris 1889), no. 490 (5 August 1279), p. 575; no. 493 (19 October 1279), p. 577. Cardinalate Gervasius de Glincamp was created Cardinal Priest by the French Pope Martin IV (Simon de Brion) in the Consistory of 12 April 1281, along with six other prelates, including Geoffrey de Bar, his fellow investigator. He was assigned the titular church of S. Martino ai Monti.Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi Tomus I, editio altera (Monasterii 1913) p. 10. S. Martino was and is serviced by Carmelite monks. Since Martin IV never visited Rome even once during his pontificate, but kept the Roman Curia either in Viterbo or Orvieto, it is unlikely that Cardinal de Clinchamp saw the city of Rome either, until the accession of Honorius IV. In November 1282 he was a member of a committee of cardinals who reviewed the election and the personal character of Reynaldus Malavolti, Bishop-elect of Siena.Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), pp. 70-71, no. 192 (16 November 1282). At the same time, he was a member of a committee that reviewed the election of a new abbot of Cryptaferrata, which they found to be uncanonical; but Pope Martin confirmed his election anyway.Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), p. 90, no. 253 (17 November 1282). In September 1283, Cardinal Gervais and Cardinal Girolamo Masci received a mandate from Pope Martin to intervene in a war between the people of Viterbo and the Orsini family over the ownership of the castello of Monte Coccozonis, which was held in feudal tenure from the Roman Church.Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), pp. 217-218, no. 474 (7 September 1283).

Cecilia in Trastevere a silver icon which had been bequeathed by the late Pope,M. Prou (editor), Les registres d' Honorius IV, pp. 55-56, no. 65.

Prou (editor), Les registres d' Honorius IV, pp. 91-92, no. 100 (4 September 1285). Eubel, p. 503. In March 1286, Cardinal Gervais was appointed Auditor by Pope Honorius IV (Savelli) to examine the contested election of a bishop of Lescar in France.M. Prou (editor), Les registres d' Honorius IV, p. 254 no. 343 (17 March 1286). In 1287, beginning on 22 July, the General Chapter of the Carmelites had its meeting in Montpellier under the leadership of Petrus de Aemiliano, their Prior General. One of the issues that they were debating was the use of a cloak as part of the habit, and the desire of some of the monks that the color of the habit and the cloak should be standardized; there was also a proposal that it should be dispensed with entirely. In anticipation of dissention and wishing to show proper respect to the Pope, they approached the Holy See, and the matter was explained to Pope Honorius (who died on 3 April 1287) by Cardinal Gervaisius de Glincamp. Permission was given by the Pope, through, Cardinal Gervasius, for them to deal with the matter in their General Chapter, and act in accordance with their constitutions. The Cardinal wrote them a letter to that effect from the Basilica XII Apostolorum on 9 February 1287. He wrote another letter on 3 May, reassuring them of Rome's position, as he had previously explained it, and that the death of the Pope did not change the instructions.Eliseo Monsignano (editor), Bullarium Carmelitarum Pars prima (Rome 1715), pp. 35-38. Death and Burial Pope Honorius IV (Savelli) died on Holy Thursday 3 April 1287. Cardinal Ancher Pantaleon, Cardinal Priest of Santa Prassede, in fact, predeceased Pope Honorius, dying on 1 November 1286. At the time of the Pope's death there were therefore only sixteen cardinals, but three of them were outside the Curia on diplomatic assignments. Cardinal Comes Casate, Cardinal Priest of SS. Marcellino e Pietro was dead on or by 8 April 1287. The Conclave began in mid-April at the papal palace next to Santa Sabina on the Aventine Hill in Rome. During the Sede Vacante in 1287 there also died Cardinal Geoffrey of Alatri, Giordano Orsini, and Geoffrey de Bar, Cardinal Priest of Santa Susanna.

It was built circa 1860s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Raspberry Creek homestead, circa 1865 The Raspberry Creek homestead was built by James Hutton and Mary Hutton nee Cameron, pioneers of the Shoalwater Bay area in Central Queensland. Originally, a slab hut was constructed in the early 1860s and in ensuring years as the family grew, the homestead was extended. In 1965, the homestead was included in the area taken up as the Shoalwater Bay Training Area. In 1988 the Raspberry Creek Homestead was moved to its present location in the grounds of the Byfield Historical Society. James Hutton was the son of William Hutton and Rose Ann Hutton nee Cleland. William was a farm labourer and native of Inch, County Down, Ireland, and Rose Ann was a farm servant and native of Killyleagh, County Down. William and Rose had ten children, all born in Ireland. The family migrated to Australia, departing from Greenock on 21 May 1841 on the ship Percy, arriving in Sydney on 28 August 1841. Mary Cameron was the daughter of John and Margaret Cameron of Fort William, Inverness, Scotland. John was a boat builder. He and Margaret had eight children, all born in Scotland. They migrated with six of their children on the ship Blonde, arriving 27 December 1849. Both the Camerons and the Huttons settled at or near Falconer Station, later Falconer Township, in the New England area of New South Wales. The families became close through intermarriage: James Hutton married Mary Cameron in 1852; Jemima Hutton married John Cameron in 1855; and Maxwell Hutton married Ellen Cameron in 1861. Nine years after their marriage, James and Mary Hutton moved with their children to Central Queensland, taking up the Raspberry Creek run, north of Rockhampton, in 1863. The journey took six months and the family brought with them all their possessions, loaded on two buckboards driven by Mary and their seven year old son William, and some few hundred head of cattle. Family lore has it that James Hutton had previously visited the area with Robert Ross and his sons, James and John, who were also from the New England district. James Hutton and James Ross formed a partnership to acquire the Raspberry Creek Run. James Hutton then returned to New South Wales selling their property and organising the journey north to Central Queensland. On arrival, the party went first to Cawarral, where Mary and the children remained until the first bark and slab huts were erected at Raspberry Creek. These huts were about three miles from the site finally selected and were later moved. The present homestead was built using pit-sawn timber for the walls and shingles for the roof. By 1868, the partnership between Ross and Hutton had dissolved and the Huttons became the sole owners of Raspberry Creek. From 1869, following resumption and opening of the resumed land to selection, the Huttons took up further selections at Shoalwater and Banksia. When the family grew larger, weather boards for extensions were brought in by boat along Shoalwater Creek most stores were brought in by boat as it was easier than overlanding. In 1894, the Huttons moved to Sydney where they stayed until Mary's death in 1896. James returned to Raspberry Creek and continued to run the station with his eldest son William until his death in 1898. William Hutton resided at Raspberry Creek Homestead until his retirement in 1911. During his time on Raspberry Creek, William, and his wife Rose, gained a reputation for their refined hospitality. Raspberry Creek was sold to William Naughton in 1914 and passed out of the ownership of the Hutton Family. William Naughton divided and sold the property with Fred and William Flowers brothers applied for resumed portions and forming their stations. Raspberry Creek was bought by Tom Creed in 1939. Under Commonwealth Acquisition 728, Raspberry Creek homestead become part of the Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area on 1 July 1965. Whilst included within the training area, Raspberry Creek homestead was not in permanent use, though it had been utilised as a base camp for reconnaissance parties and by the Federal Department of Construction employees working within the training area. From mid-1987, Raspberry Creek homestead was not utilised as a base camp. Relocated from the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in 1988, with the aid of a Bicentennial grant, the Raspberry Creek Homestead is sited on a reserve for Cultural & Historical Purposes under the trusteeship of Livingstone Shire Council and leased by Byfield & District Historical Society Inc. The Society operates a museum and library in the former homestead.  Description  Raspberry Creek Homestead is located in the grounds of the Byfield and District Historical Society, along Byfield Road. The homestead comprises three sections which were originally attached. Since being moved to the society grounds, the original slab section has been detached. Some of the original material on the slab section of the homestead has been replaced, whilst in other sections the timber framework is exposed. The two later extensions, located to the west of the slab section, remain attached. The larger of the two sections is constructed of timber on timber stumps with weatherboard cladding and has a verandah on three sides. The building has a corrugated iron roof. It is attached to the smaller extension on the north-east side. The smaller section is timber framed set on timber stumps, clad with weatherboards. A timber ramp is located on the south-eastern side of the larger, three roomed building where it joins with the smaller two- roomed section. The homestead currently contains items that form part of the material collection of the Byfield and District Historical Society. A library is located in one of the rooms of the larger section.  Heritage listing  Raspberry Creek Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Raspberry Creek Homestead is significant as a extant example of the type of early pioneer construction in the Shoalwater Bay area. With later extensions, Raspberry Creek Homestead provides evidence of the evolution of vernacular architecture. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The former Raspberry Creek Homestead is valued by the community as demonstrated by the project to preserve it as an important part of the history of the area, and it is associated with the historical society whose focus it has been since the late 1980s. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former Raspberry Creek Homestead is significant for its association with James and Mary Hutton, early pioneers in the Shoalwater Bay area.

Trained in France and Australia, her specialties in social anthropology include Australian Aboriginal society and culture (as well as other Fourth World Peoples), iconography and visual systems, various expressions of gender, ritual and social organization, health and citizenship. Dussart's career in anthropology began at the Sorbonne, where she studied the ethnolinguistic nuances of West African naming systems, the culture of street performers in Paris, and the slate factories of southern France. She received her Ph.D. degree from the Australian National University for fieldwork with the Warlpiri people living in the Tanami Desert. Since then, she has also devoted herself to curatorial efforts involving the acrylic painting of Central Desert Aborigines. She has published extensively on matters of Oceanian art for scholarly journals and the popular press, in French and in English. She has also consulted for numerous museums worldwide, writing catalogs, essays and assisting in general collection development. She is currently working on two related projects, a long-term research project, which investigates how indigenized modernity and indigenous ill-health play a prominent part in shaping neo-settler states such as Australia, for which she has published papers on how Warlpiri people from Central Australia cope with chronic ill-health on a daily basis. She curated the first comprehensive major exhibition of contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts (over 100 artworks) from Australia in Canada, at the Mus√©e de la Civilisation in Quebec City. This exhibition titled Lifelines: Contemporary Indigenous Art from Australia opened 20 October 2015 and will close 6 September 2016.

Diabetes  = Diabetes and the Reconstruction of Indigenous Sociality = The statistics among Fourth World Peoples - well documented in Sub-Saharan Africa, throughout the Americas and Asia (Eko√© et al. 2001; Joe and Young 1994; Mbanya and Mbanya 2003; McMurray and Smith 2001; Rock 2005)^are even more dire.1 Indigenously populated regions of Australia have been particularly hard hit by the diabetes pandemic; Aboriginal residents of remote settlements are ten times more likely than the broader population to suffer Type 2 diabetes (Cass et al. 2005). In some Aboriginal communities, one in three adults is afflicted with the disease. As a result of this dispiriting reality, a good deal of biomedical analysis has been focused on the affliction among indigenous populations. Typically, the work in question presumes that misunderstanding and miscommunication undermine treatment and diagnosis. But my analysis, based on data collected in 2006 and 2007 at a Central Desert Aboriginal settlement, challenges certain aspects of that presumption. Field research suggests that many Aboriginal peoples, knowledgeable about the main etiological aspects of the disease, knowingly sidestep biomedical treatment protocols - strict weight management, the modification of dietary habit and exercise - and translate notions of chronic and acute illness to accommodate their own notions of neocolonial social identity. Indeed, rather than misinterpreting etiologies and treatments, Warlpiri people tend to reinterpret the language surrounding diabetes, and in so doing make manifest, in the medical universe, the land of \\"indigenization of modernity\\" that MarshaU SahUns has observed the material and technological cultures of other Fourth World Peoples. Warlpiri people's response to diabetes displays a community not only capable, but compelled, to tailor medical protocols and discourse to indigenously constituted patterns of residential kinship and social connectedness, as well as distinctly Aboriginal notions of personal autonomy. By so doing, Warlpiri people reshape the local praxis of their society (Foucault 1973) in ways that undermine the universalizing discourses of national healthcare organizations, schools, correctional faculties, Christian churches and other \\"knowledge-making institutions.\\" References Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:University of Connecticut faculty ","title":"Fran√ßoise Dussart"},{"id":"48925815","text":"Meridian School is a private non-denominational liberal arts school in Springville, Utah, serving students from preschool to twelfth grade. Founded in 1989, the school was established because the relocation of the private Waterford School from Provo, Utah, to Salt Lake City metropolitan area left a void in Utah County, Utah. In 2004, Meridian bought a 14-acre private park from Geneva Steel, planning to construct a school there, but the location lacked utilities, which stymied construction. In 2008, after 19 years at their first location, Meridian School moved to Orem, Utah, renting the building from Christ Evangelical Church. The school closed in 2010 because of financial problems and declining enrollment. In 2011, the school reopened after undergoing a restructuring where it received financial backing from Align International Education Group, an international investing firm. The school signed an agreement with Beijing No.4 High School to share materials. History =Foundation= Meridian School was founded in 1989. A void had been left in Utah County, Utah, after the private Waterford School had relocated from Provo, Utah to Salt Lake City metropolitan area. The school was formed by a few Brigham Young University professors, nearby businessmen, and Waterford parents. The school was based at 931 E. Third North, the former location of Waterford School, and rented the building from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City. The school chose its mascot as the mongoose because the mongoose is \\"small but tough, quick and tenacious\\". For the 1989‚Äì1990 school year, tuition was set at $2,500 per pupil and $2,000 for every subsequent sibling. The school aimed to rely on parent volunteers and focus on a liberal arts education. Serving students from preschool to twelfth grade, Meridian also taught students Mormon catechism. Hal Miller was the school's headmaster when it opened in 1989, and Kevin Clyde took over as headmaster in 1991. In 2004, Meridian bought a private park at Geneva Road and Interstate 15 owned by Geneva Steel's employee group Geneva Recreation Association, planning to move their campus there by 2005. The 14-acre site lacked utilities, which posed an issue for construction and preventing Meridian from moving there. In 2008, after spending 19 years at their original location, Meridian moved to 280 S. 400 East in Orem, Utah, renting the property from Christ Evangelical Church. =Closing and reopening= The Meridian School campus at Merit Academy in Springville, Utah, January 2016 In the late 2000s, roughly 10% of Meridian School's students were from a foreign student exchange program. The foreign students largely came from Asia and Central America. In the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, 170 students attended the school. But in the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, only 100 students were enrolled at the beginning of the year. The school's new head, Dan Smith, a Meridian School alumnus, told the Daily Herald that 100 was a \\"fragile number\\" and that \\"it started changing quickly. We did see something like a run on the banks.\\" The school closed on August 19, 2010, owing to financial issues and diminishing student enrollment. In December 2010, parents announced their plans to reopen Meridian as a for-profit school in its earlier location in Provo with former Meridian part-time teacher Tasi Young as its leader. They believed that a for-profit structure would be more sustainable than a non-profit one. In the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, the school underwent at restructuring and reopened after receiving lasting financial backing from Align International Education Group, an international investing firm. Daniel Wong, a student's father who had international finance experience, contacted the school, spearheading the reopening, and was joined by teachers, parents, and Chinese businesspeople. Meridian signed a \\"cooperation agreement\\" with Beijing No.4 High School, a widely known high school in China, in which the two schools would jointly use materials. Meridian planned to have a student exchange program, a teacher exchange program, and summer camps in China and the United States. Roughly 20% of Meridian's high school students in the first year of the agreement would be from China. In the 2013‚Äì2014 school year, some Meridian teachers created a new school called Arches Academy at the same location in Orem previously used by Meridian. The new school moved away from being a for-profit concentrated on international studies to a non-profit focused on the local community. Arches Academy teaches Singapore math, balanced literacy, and FranklinCovey's The Leader in Me curriculum. Notable alumniMasa Fukuda ‚Äì founder and director of One Voice Children's Choir. In his second year of high school, Fukuda elected to participate in a student exchange program at Meridian School. At the school, he encountered Brigham Young University music professors, who impressed him with their strong teaching, convincing him to enroll at BYU.

Early in the sports development some ex-parachute jumpers and short term foreign visitors were trying to develop the sport, but with no real success. As of 2015, the community consisted of about 20 pilots, members of the sporting clubs RockStone, Gilavar, Climb Club, CanFly. Pilots are required to follow F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale main safety requirements and ethics. History One of Azerbaijan's first paragliding pilots was Huseyngulu Baghirov, he imported all the necessary equipment into the country, generally Powered paragliding, found an experienced trainer from abroad and had the first real achievements in the air. This was Azerbaijan's first step skyward in paragliding. Sometime later, an organization called FAIREX was established to develop mountaineering and air sports in Azerbaijan. This organization, with federation status, was Mr Baghirov‚Äôs brainchild. Back in 2012 in order to widen and establish the sport, FAIREX (:az: Az…ôrbaycan Hava v…ô Ekstremal ƒ∞dman N√∂vl…ôri Federasiyasƒ±) called for open training with an experienced instructor from Russia. There was huge interest from the young population in Azerbaijan to participate. Unfortunately, not everyone could make it, but it planted the seed and people fell in love with the sport. Some of these people were from Climbing and Mountaineering Club RockStone. Within the next several months, very proactive members of RockStone organized a community of the people who wanted to fly and under the instruction of a Dutch pilot from Pancho Amelia started the first training sessions with several second-hand wings. Development was so fast and proactive, that in July 2013, with FAIREX support, Azerbaijan became the home country to the first International Paragliding Festival in the Caucasus (2013 OPEN AIR PARAGLIDING FESTIVAL). The participants in the festival, apart from Azerbaijani pilots, were guests from the Netherlands, Georgia, South Africa and Belgium. Less than one year after the Festival, RockStone club had 25 pilots flying as B class pilots. The Community was growing significantly breaking into the various paragliding disciplines based on the member's individual interests, such as X-country, Acro, Moto, etc. The break even point of Paragliding in Azerbaijan is considered to be May 31, 2014, which is the day when an advanced group of pilots performed the first ‚Äùbig boy‚Äù flights from Qicky Mountain. Nikolay Zakobluk, Jamal Kashkay, Firuz Takhirov, Ziya Qasimov, Aleksey Zakobluk These flights were undertaken by Stephen Charlton, as a trainer, and pilots Alex Zakobluk, Nana Nabiyeva, Firuz Tahirov, Ziya Qasimov, Nuran Abbasov, Jamal Kashkay, Nikolay Zakobluk and Fidan Mammedova. These pilots were the pioneers of high-altitude flight in Azerbaijan on that day, and so the day has been named ‚ÄúAzerbaijan Paragliders Day‚Äù.

Orthodox Cathedral of the Dormition of the Theotokos, Vilnius = First churches =  Orthodox cathedral of Vilnius  The oldest church in Lithuania, that has been built of bricks, is the Orthodox Cathedral of the Theotokos, Vilnius. It was constructed in 1346, when the Renaissance style had not yet arrived in central Europe, and in the Grand Duchy only the Slavic population was Christian. The roofs and the design of the outer walls underwent some changes in the course of centuries. Today, the outer appearance is Neo-Byzantine, and most of the walls are plastered.  Brick Gothic  Kaunas Franciscan Vytautas Church After W≈Çadys≈Çaw II had been baptized to be a Catholic, the country officially became Christian, and churches were built also for the Lithuanian population in the northwest of the Grand Duchy. Soon the most important churches were erected in Brick Gothic: * Church of St. Nicholas in Vilnius, 1387 * Vytautas' the Great Church in Kaunas, about 1400 * St-George's Church (pl.wiki) in Kƒódainiai, 1403 * Kaunas Cathedral Basilica, 1410, several times rebuilt and redesigned in Baroque style * Franziskan Church of the Assumption of Mary (fr.wiki) in Vilnius, after a wooden precursor of 1387 in bricks since 1410, several times destroyed by fire, since 1671‚Äì1675 mainly Baroque. = Late Gothic =  Flamboyant style  \\"House of Perk≈´nas\\", Kaunas In the period of late Gothic, in Lithuania two exceptional buildings were created, in abundant French Flamboyant style, but realized in bricks. * The House of Perk≈´nas was built in the mid 15th century as a trading post of the Hanseatic League and had tha function till 1532.

An idea of woman and woman‚Äôs higher education\\", in Women‚Äôs History Magazine, 58, Spring/Summer 2008, pp. 34‚Äì37. Life Margaret Fletcher was born in Oxford as one of nine children of an Anglican clergyman, Rev.Carteret J.H. Fletcher. She attended Oxford High School and later studied art in Oxford under John Ruskin, at Slade School of Art and at the Female School of Art in Bloomsbury. Frustrated at what she saw as a lack of opportunity for women artists in England, women, for example, being barred from life classes, aged only 20, when it was still unconventional for young women to travel unchaperoned, she went to Colorassi Studio in Paris, where both sexes were treated equally. She continued her studies there,(a picture of hers was hung in the Salon), and met with people from different backgrounds which raised her awareness to a global level which was unlikely to have occurred in the security and complacence of Victorian England. Her stay in Paris was cut short by the death of her mother in 1888 but it helped to shape her future work. She returned to Oxford, abandoning a promising career as a professional artist, to look after her younger siblings and her father whom she cared for until his death in 1918, aged 91.\\"The family\\",she modestly wrote,\\"must be my first care. Nothing can exceed the futile misery of the sacrifice of other lives made on the altar of small talents\\". She continued painting as a hobby and in 1889 went with a girl friend on a sketching tour of Hungary. She illustrated with pen and ink sketches scenes from Jane Austen, in Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen (1895). Her paintings include \\"Nancy\\" exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1886, Professor Thorold Rogers (1891) which hangs in Worcester College, Oxford, the actress Lady Martin Harvey (stage- name Nell de Silva) (1889) and Jesuit Fr. Dominic Plater (1920) in possession of Jesuit Archives in London. She also established a life class in Oxford despite some opposition from the City authorities. She engaged in some theatrical ventures with Nigel Playfair and Rosina Filippi in the O.U.D.S. and elsewhere with Frank Benson and the Martin-Harveys. Despite her father being an Anglican clergyman, in 1897 she converted to Catholicism without any opposition from her family. In 1904 she founded a quarterly magazine, The Crucible, aimed at providing a periodical of higher education for women and arousing the interest of teachers and schools in getting better education for women. This led in 1906 to her founding, with the approval of the Catholic hierarchy, the Catholic Women's League (\\"CWL\\"). She worked tirelessly to ensure its success and to promote the emancipation of women and a more prominent role for them in education and other spheres of public life, travelling extensively both in Great Britain and on the Continent. It was the time of the Suffrage movement but Fletcher saw many dangers inherent in it. Her aim was \\"to put into the field trained bands of women\\" by promoting the education of Catholic lay women to engage in the public sphere. She was convinced that the conventional protective shelter for women was unnecessary. Her success as an educator and enabler of Catholic lay women's participation in this sphere was well demonstrated during the First World War. CWL was able to place \\"trained bands of women\\" at the disposal of both Church and state for war work. CWL staffed canteen huts both at home and abroad for servicemen and provided accommodation for Belgian refugees and munition workers, receiving recognition for its work from the British, French and Belgian governments. Similar work was carried out during the Second World War when mobile canteens were sent to Normandy as early as August 1944 and CWL was active in every theatre of the War. Fletcher had retired for the last time from presidency of CWL in 1922 by which time many branches of CWL had sprung up, both in the UK and abroad and its continuing charitable work is a fitting tribute to the organisation's founder.

Khan was the founder and president of Brick Kiln Workers Front, and BLLF Global, a human rights organization that opposes slavery and child slavery in Pakistan and South Asia. He is the national coordinator of Global March in Sweden. In 1992 he freed Iqbal Masih, who was working in the carpet industry.With Ehsan Ullah Khan, Iqbal Masih's friend On April 16, 1995 Iqbal was assassinated. The murder brought to light the work of those who had been denouncing that millions of children all over the world could not attend school because they had become profitable for big corporations that exploited them. Khan was the pioneer on this campaign.http://www.kailashsatyarthi.net/speeches/070803.php He has raised slavery issues in the United Nations, through the Working Group for Contemporary Forms of Slavery and in International Labour Organization (ILO). Khan has been a speaker at many Conferences; he has been mentioned in many books, interviewed by a large number of social media, summoned to make a film on Iqbal's life, has been the leader of campaigns and the one who proposed Iqbal for Reebok international award in Boston.  Biography  Ullah Khan studied journalism at Punjab University, in Lahore. While still a student, he began to organize brick kiln workers so that they rebelled against slavery. After meeting Babba Kaala he became aware of the drama of slavery in his country. His daughters had been kidnapped by the owner of the kiln on the pretext of not receiving the monthly installment on the debt the old man had incurred. Kailash Satyarthi‚Äôs Pakistan connection Foundation of Bhatta Mazdor Mahaz In September 1967 he formed Bhatta Mazdor Mahaz (BMM). The BMM was not only organizing actions and demonstrations of different kinds against bonded system of labor, but it was also providing legal aid to give basic human rights to the bonded workers at the brick kilns for the first time in the history of South Asia. Forced labor was common among many other groups, like agriculture, carpet making, and mine workers. In 1987, he mobilized some workers to present their cause to the Supreme Court of Justice. It was as a result of the pressure exerted by Ehsan and his movement that in 1988 a law declared peshgi (debt bondage system) illegal.http://europe.newsweek.com/slavery-198912?rm=eu Iqbal Masih's liberation It was the BLLF that freed Iqbal from slavery, as well as other 40,000 children in Pakistan, and it was Khan who put the fight against children slavery up for discussion once slavery had been abolished in his country, twenty years after he had started his abolitionist struggle. When Ehsan met Iqbal Masih, the boy was shy and afraid, but Khan realized he had many things to tell. Khan feels that non-violence is the best of paths. The importance of the role of children is emphasized in his development strategy, which is that \\"the victims should be empowered\\". Khan states that \\"those children, who get a basic education, knowledge about their rights, and hope for their future, will themselves eliminate the slavery\\". Imprisonment and torture Working as a journalist, he was arrested many times due to his activities for human rights and the freedom of press. In 1982 he went to jail for six months and kept in confinement in a dark cell in the torture camp of Lahore Fort during Zia ul Haq's decade-long dictatorship from 1978 to 1988. He was arrested and tortured after he had written an article about the genetic development of biological warfare germs in a government-controlled laboratory in Lahore. Because of the torture he lost almost all his hearing from one ear. In an article, he denounced how bonded brick kiln workers had been used as guinea pigs and died due to experiments in a secret research project. The charge against him was high treason, which carried the death penalty. In December 1994, he accompanies Iqbal to the United States to receive an International Award in Boston, Massachusetts. They visit Broad Meadows Middle School in Quincy,Freedom Hero: Iqbal Masih where after knowing about Iqbal's murder, some students start a campaign to raise money for a School in Pakistan,A bullet can't kill a dream.

It was built from 1860s to 1940s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 July 2004.  History  The road leading to and from the ford at Byfield Creek was established in the 1860s when the district was occupied by pastoral interests. It was a section of the sole track from Maryvale Station north to Byfield Head Station, and continuing on to stations in the Shoalwater area. A specific date of construction for the stone-pitched ford across Byfield Creek on this road has not been established, but as the ford facilitated access to Byfield Head Station and to properties to the north and west of Byfield, it may date to the 1860s when Byfield Head Station was established on the northern bank of the creek opposite where the ford is now sited. The crossing is the only known surviving section of stone pitching along what was, from settlement in the 1860s to the 1930s, the only access route to stations directly north of Yeppoon. Byfield (originally Bayfield) is an isolated district, sandwiched between the Byfield Range and the Capricorn Coast. Traditionally it was home to the Butcha-Bura people (meaning men of the Banksia or Honey Suckle Tree). The Butcha-Bura belonged to the Ningebul tribe, which in turn was part of the Darrambul Nation, and they lived within the Byfield district until the latter part of the 19th century. The area was explored by Ludwig Leichhardt and Thomas Mitchell between 1844 and 1846 and provided the most manageable overland route to the grassy plains of Shoalwater and Broadsound to the north. Land management practices of the Butcha-Bura people contributed to the development of these plains, which later proved ideal for the grazing of sheep and cattle. Fire stick farming enticed wallabies and kangaroo to feed on sweet new growth of grass, making hunting practices easier and more predictable. Broadsound and the Isaac River country were explored by William Landsborough and J McDonald between 1847 and 1858, for the purpose of marking out runs. On 10 January 1854 the New South Wales Government proclaimed the Port Curtis Pastoral District open to settlement under pastoral occupation license. Landsborough acquired the Shoalwater run for a short period before L Samuel won a tender for it in 1858. The run was renamed Raspberry Creek due to the abundance of native raspberry in the area. The first wave of permanent non- indigenous settlers to the Byfield and Shoalwater districts commenced in the early 1860s, with the arrival of the Hutton, Ross, Atherton and Tucker families, mostly from the New England district of New South Wales. In February 1863 the Tucker family selected the Maryvale and Bayfield (later Byfield) runs. Robert Ross and James Hutton took over the Raspberry Creek license from Samuel in 1863, along with the leases of Shoalwater and Banksia Plain in the same year. Hutton later bought out Ross' share in Raspberry Creek. The Ross family, with various financial partners, obtained much of the coastal country from the mouth of the Fitzroy River north to the peninsula at Shoalwater Bay. The Peninsula run was forfeited by Ross in 1864 and was successfully bid for at auction by Edward Hampton (Cranky) Baker. By 1865, Elliot of Tilpal had joined the Huttons, Newbold and \\"Cranky\\" Baker as being among the first to permanently settle to the north of Byfield Creek in the Shoalwater area. In the 1860s the Byfield and Shoalwater districts were accessed via a single circuitous route from Rockhampton, by-passing the Berserker Range which lay between the coast and the Fitzroy River. Materials, livestock and other goods were transported to and from these remote northern properties via this route, which linked head station to head station, and crossed Byfield Creek near Byfield Head Station. An October 1868 survey of Maryvale Run (survey plan P42.90) shows the \\"Road to Byfield\\" linking Maryvale and Byfield head stations. Byfield Head Station was located on the northern bank of Byfield Creek near the creek crossing. In the mid-1880s the Byfield district was surveyed into farm portions and opened for agricultural selection. Pastoral leases gave way to agriculture, encouraged by longer tenure and high yields from relatively small areas. An 1887 survey plan of the farm portions surrounding the Byfield Head Station block (portion 171, surveyed in 1870) shows the old route linking Byfield with stations to the north and west, circumventing the homestead block along its eastern and northern boundaries. In 1887 this route was surveyed officially as the main road to Raspberry Creek and Peninsula stations, and heading south to Maryvale, crossing Byfield Creek in the approximate location of the stone-pitched ford, although the ford itself is not indicated on the map. The section of this road which follows the eastern boundary of the Byfield homestead block is now known as Richters Road. A second track, marked as 'old postman's track', was also indicated on the 1887 survey plan. This track traversed the Byfield homestead block diagonally from northwest to southeast, meeting Byfield Creek at the approximate location of the stone-pitched ford and the road south to Maryvale, and joining the road to Raspberry Creek north of the Byfield Head Station block. The influx of new settlers increased traffic over the old Byfield Road across Byfield Creek. They needed to bring goods in and out by wagon and required a reliable crossing for foot traffic, vehicles and animals. In 1888 a weekly mail service from Yeppoon to Raspberry Creek via Maryvale and Byfield commenced. The route was over using two or three horses with pack saddles to carry mail and goods to be delivered. Jock Cowan continued this service to the residents of Byfield and Shoalwater for 40 years, using the Byfield Creek crossing to gain access to the northern route to Raspberry Creek via what is now Richters Road. In the 1930s the Sherriff brothers introduced motorised delivery vehicles on the mail route. Beginning with motor bikes and then a utility fitted out like a little shop, they sold cigarettes, chocolates and odds and ends to residents along with delivering the mail once a week on a Sunday, using the crossing to access northern properties. Well into the 20th century, horses and cattle continued to be driven along the old Byfield Road into Yeppoon for the sales. The Huttons of Raspberry Creek and Shoalwater runs were prominent in the establishment of the pastoral industry in Central Queensland, and worked with the Flowers brothers of nearby Yandouble and Pine Mountain to establish a live cattle export from Port Clinton to New Caledonia. To get cattle to the Rockhampton market, the Huttons and other graziers would drive them along the Byfield Road, using the fording to cross Byfield Creek to reach Adelaide Park Road, which follows the Mount Hedlow route around the Berserker Range. The Huttons, as with many families in the region, also bred their own racehorses along with work and saddle horses. Horse breeders such as the Huttons and Geddes found there was more profit in selling horses to India as army remounts and polo ponies than selling cattle. To get these horses to markets, they either needed to be driven along the route that crossed Byfield Creek, or loaded onto ships at Port Clinton. Country race meetings and other social events were held on the station runs between 1879 and 1909, attracting visitors to the Shoalwater district from as far afield as Mt Hedlow and The Oaks. These races were held under the banner of the Palmerston Amateur Turf Club, formed in 1879, and known as \\"The Raspberry Creek Races\\" although events were held at Banksia, The Oaks and Tooloombah as well as Raspberry Creek. Travel to and from the northern stations for these and other social engagements was only possible via the old Byfield Road and required traversing the Byfield Creek crossing either by buggy or on horseback. Byfield district graziers and fruit-growers used the old road over Byfield Creek until a by- pass was opened in the early 1940s, in response to pressure from an increasing number of residents attracted to the area. A map of the area shows the development of the bypass as being nearly complete, but resumption of land through Lot 10 delayed completion of the road until the early 1940s. The bypass, known as the Yeppoon-Byfield Road, gives access to the Byfield State School, Post Office and General Store and provides a comfortable journey for travellers between Yeppoon and properties north of Byfield Creek, with overpasses constructed over creeks and the roadway designed as a durable all- weather passage. This bypass circumvents the road leading to and around the boundary of Lot 171 and rejoins the original route at the northern intersection of Yaxley and Byfield Roads. Although the Byfield Creek crossing on the old Byfield Road was cut off by the bypass, it remained in use as a short-cut for local property owners and council workers, being used by foot traffic, horseback riders, vehicles and heavy machinery, until very recent times. In an effort to stop vehicles using the crossing, the Livingstone Shire Council placed bollards across the old roadway, but these were removed shortly after by persons unknown and have not been replaced. By the early 21st century the old road south of the Byfield Creek crossing was overgrown, with re-growth vegetation, fallen trees and branches making it difficult for vehicles to access the crossing. The road following the eastern boundary of Lot 171 (Richters Road) is still in use, but no longer crosses Byfield Creek. It is unlikely that the stone-pitched crossing will return to regular local use. Local interest in the stone-pitched crossing and the portion of the old road bounded by the Yeppoon-Byfield and Richters roads has remained strong, with the local Byfield State School using the area for Remnant Vegetation studies since the late 1990s. For descendants of the early pastoral and agricultural settlers still residing in the Byfield district, the stone-pitched crossing and road remains a tangible link with the past. Continued community involvement in the maintenance and conservation of the old road and ford resulted in its nomination to the Queensland Heritage Register.  Description  The portion of the old Byfield Road under consideration lies between the Yeppoon-Byfield Road and Richters Road, and is just under in length. The road incorporates a stone-pitched crossing over Byfield Creek at its northern end. The stone-pitched ford crosses Byfield Creek in a north-south direction at a bearing of 20?. It has a rectangular frame of timber sleepers fitted together and secured by bolts, presumably iron coach bolts, and filled with stone pitching to create a causeway across the creek. The exposed fording is wide by in length. The average dimensions of the framework logs are: western log diameter; eastern log diameter; southern log diameter; and northern log diameter. The stone pitching extends into the northern embankment past the water-mark. Within the crossing some stones have become loose and dislodged from their positions, which may be a result of natural erosion (scouring), or from motor-vehicles. Some subsidence has occurred, with the level of some stones lower in position compared to others, and cracking of some stones is evident. The predominant area of weathering and subsidence occurs in the middle of the ford, where water appears to be permanent to semi-permanent. This part of the ford is the most vulnerable to erosion associated with high water velocity during flooding. A natural sand deposit on the southern bank of the creek is encroaching onto the crossing, and plant shoots are growing between the stone pitching. The log at the southern aspect is exposed for only a small portion, less than , the remainder being covered by encroaching sand deposits, up to an approximate depth of . Sediment deposits currently extend to approximately from the point of the southern sleeper into the fording. At the south-west cross-section, an exposed bolt is located in the middle of the southern log, approximately from its upper edge. Exposed height of the bolt is approximately and it appears to be an iron coach bolt. In the south-west corner, the log appears to extend into the creek bank and is covered by sediments, indicating a continuation of the fording. Combined with the presence of sandy loam sediments extending approx further south up the embankment, the apparent extension of the log may indicate the fording extends further into the southern bank than what is currently exposed. From the crossing, the southern section of the old stock route extends approximately to the Yeppoon-Byfield Road. There is a large sandy deposit extending up the bank from the creek, which appears to have been washed downslope from loose deposits. Above the sand-bank, the roadway is composed of clay and stone which rises for several metres before levelling out, with the soil changing to a loamy composition. Native trees, ferns and palms grow thickly along the embankment and creek bank. Continuing towards the Yeppoon-Byfield Road, the path is covered with ground vegetation, leaf litter, including pine needles and fallen branches mixed with loose sand and soil. Towards the intersection with the Yeppoon-Byfield Road, a culvert has been created for draining water away from the road. Ground vegetation, mainly grasses and some saplings, provides a masking effect along the side of the Yeppoon- Byfield Road, making the entrance to the old road easy to overlook when driving past. The northern section of the old road extends approximately from the northern bank of Byfield Creek along what is now part of Richters Road reserve. There is no sand deposit, with the embankment composed of a clay-based soil. There is thick ground-cover vegetation to either side of the path leading up the embankment and onto Richters Road, which is predominately blady grass. This ground-cover hides the entrance to the old road from Richters Road. Native trees, ferns and palms grow along either side of the pathway on the embankment down to the creek.  Heritage listing  The Old Byfield Road was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 July 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Old Byfield Road was in use from the 1860s and is important in illustrating the pattern of non-indigenous settlement in the Byfield, Shoalwater and Broadsound districts of central Queensland. The old road was the only access route to stations north and west of Byfield until the early 1940s, and was important in the establishment of the cattle and later fruit growing industries of the Capricorn Coast. The stone-pitched crossing which fords Byfield Creek along this route may date to the 1860s, and is integral to our understanding of the function of this road as a principal access route. This crossing was the only made access to the northern end of Byfield and outlying properties until the final section of the Yeppoon-Byfield Road was opened to traffic in the early 1940s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place is significant as the only remaining unmodified section of the original road through Byfield to and from properties in Shoalwater and Broadsound. The stone-pitched crossing is important in demonstrating a method of constructing fords which is no longer practiced, and is of particular interest as the only remaining stone-pitched crossing in the Byfield area in an unmodified condition. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The stone-pitched crossing is important in demonstrating a method of constructing fords which is no longer practiced, and is of particular interest as the only remaining stone-pitched crossing in the Byfield area in an unmodified condition. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place is valued by the Byfield community for its historical and educational associations. The crossing and early road has special association for the local community with the work of early settlers and postal workers, and is valued for its important role in early transport and communication in an otherwise isolated district. The place is also valued by the community for its remnant native vegetation.

When a group of terrorists led by Xavier kidnap Susie for a ransom courtesy of Lillian's rich uncle, she is warned not to call the local authorities. Shocked and undeterred at the same time, Lillian decides to call her ex-husband, detective Mike Clark. When Mike is still miffed at the fact that Lillian and he had split up due to an affair she had with David, a local karate instructor, Lillian yells at Mike that he should be man enough to take care of his own daughter. However, in an even more shocking turn of events, Lillian isn't sure who is really Susie's father: Mike or David. Lillian gives David a call to help with the kidnapping. When Mike finds David at the parking lot of a local restaurant, Mike blows a gasket and starts to fight David in the middle of the lot. Mike accidentally kicks a bystander sitting in his car when he misses David. It is clear that both Mike and David have agreed to help Lillian and pose as gardeners in Lillian's home. However, when it looks like David may be working his charm on Lillian but it is nothing more than plain talk, Mike's jealousy gets to him again and Lillian even threatens that if they can't work together, they can't help rescue Susie. Mike and David search throughout Los Angeles to look for Susie. Along the way, they run into goons like Hammer, who is working for Xavier's regime. As they begin their relentless search for Susie, they slowly begin to bond but not without getting into fights themselves. In one such case, after being forced to fight each other to the delight of a crowd, they escape and then they argue and fight each other before they are ambushed by Hammer and his goons and have to settle their differences later. Meanwhile, Susie is returned to Lillian but with a bomb strapped to her, which to her complete shock, has been set up by her husband Howard. Howard, who reveals to have married Lillian only to get his hands on the family's fortune, and Xavier have been in cahoots to split the ransom. When Howard refuses to help Xavier anymore than he felt necessary, the two go their separate ways. Meanwhile, Mike and David come to the rescue and narrowly escape after replacing water jugs for Susie's body and are shot at by Howard and his goons. Mike, Lillian, and Susie are confronted by Howard (now in a helicopter) and some men, who are shooting at them while David finds himself using his martial arts skills against more goons, including the monster Aguilar, on the beach. Mike shoots Howard down from the helicopter and Lillian escapes with Susie, only to be confronted by Xavier, who plots to take Susie for another ransom. Lillian and Xavier, brandishing a gun, struggle until it is revealed that Lillian has shot and killed Xavier, sending him to the water. At the end, Lillian, David, Mike, and Susie are happily enjoying their new lives as friends and family.

It was built from 1910s to 1940s. It is also known as Botanic Gardens Reserve. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 29 April 2003.  History  Bell Park was gazetted in 1899 as a Reserve for Botanic Gardens and Public Reserve, following an earlier gazettal in 1892 as a Reserve for Public Purposes. Following developments, particularly in the early 1910s with the establishment of pathways and seating by the Emu Park Ladies Improvement League, the Reserve became a popular venue. The popularity of the park was re-established during the 1940s when large company picnics were held there. Bell Park is still very much valued by the community and continues to be a focal point as a recreational destination for residents and visitors. In 1867, residents of Rockhampton signed a petition asking the Surveyor-General to mark out a town at the nearest point on the central Queensland coast where they might be able to enjoy a day at the beach. The place selected was on the Cawarral cattle run, owned by Messrs Ross, Beddome and Palmer. By 9 January 1869, a proclamation appeared in the Queensland Government Gazette declaring Emu Park a Town Reserve. One of the more important aspects of Emu Park's development occurred with the establishment of the Emu Park railway line from Rockhampton in 1888. The survey for the line was begun in 1885, and on 30 September of that year, Parliament approved a direct line via Lake's Creek. To save the expense of bridging the Fitzroy River, the line started from North Rockhampton, and as a result of this, was to be the creation of two separate railway systems for Rockhampton, similar to Bundaberg. The original survey by Robert Ballard called for a line traversing a mangrove swamp for a distance of six miles (eleven kilometres) for the run into Emu Park. The permanent survey for the line however showed that the Ballard route was situated below the high water mark. A cheaper (but longer) route was adopted instead. Fountain Brothers were awarded the contract on 27 October 1886. Heavy rain interrupted construction, however the line was opened on 22 December 1888, in time for the Christmas period. During its history, sometimes as many as five trains, with up to 13 carriages each, were handled by the turntable at the Emu Park railway station, especially on picnic days. Whilst the Rockhampton to Emu Park line was predominantly a recreational line, within twenty years of its proclamation, Emu Park, with only a small local population and dependent on Rockhampton for support and assistance in almost every aspect of its development, had a railway line, new school, boarding houses and hotels to cater for visitors as well as other service facilities. Most significant however, were the number of private holiday homes being established in the town Emu Park was made even more accessible when, in late 1899, the Rockhampton Junction Railway was completed, connecting Rockhampton railway station to North Rockhampton railway stations. As a result, people further afield, including Mount Morgan residents, could enjoy a break at the beach. From the outset, two trains ran each way daily including Sundays and three on Saturdays. As the town of Emu Park developed, the Emu Park Progress Association, sought to preserve an area facing Fisherman's Beach close to the town. It was an area of greenery, that was considered to be unique in the area. Correspondence of 9 December 1889 requesting the improvement and proclamation of the area as a Park reserve was sent from the Gogango Divisional Board to the Under Secretary for Lands in Brisbane. This request, was initially rejected, but was however, successful later, when in 1892, an area was set aside as a Reserve for Public Purposes. The same area was re- established, in 1899, as a Reserve for Botanic Gardens and Public Purposes. This area was later to be renamed Bell Park. Originally, the Botanic Gardens Reserve included an area of around from Hill to Pybus Streets and from the coast to the railway yards. The gazettal was sought to preserve the \\"natural\\" garden space rather than any intention to create a formal botanic garden. Located on the sea front, the Botanic Gardens was considered to be an oasis of beauty and recreation for families and visitors, in the middle of the original Emu Park township. In 1906, the Livingstone Shire Council [The Livingstone Shire was formed by a change of name from Gogango Shire on 8 August 1903] requested the Deeds of the Botanic Gardens Reserve and the adjacent Fishermen's Reserve. This was granted and gazetted on 16 May 1908. Whilst it was gazetted as a Reserve by 1892, the Botanic Gardens Reserve did not become easily accessible to the public until the early 1910s. By 1915, souvenir pamphlets on Emu Park advertised the assets that was the Botanic Gardens Reserve. At this point, Reserve was still predominantly dense brush and was described as breaking the \\"unvarying sweep of the shore.\\" Also by this time, the care and maintenance of the Reserve was being undertaken by the Emu Park Ladies' Improvement League, headed by the President, Mrs Emily Jane Bell. The League had a small fund to carry out works such as the opening up of pathways and the provision of seats and tables. By , the timber rotundas had been constructed in the Park. It was suggested at the time that, whatever is done in the direction of upkeep and maintenance should be done carefully and that the all too common error of opening up straight tracks of any sort to the beach, should be \\"most carefully avoided.\\" The Botanic Gardens was renamed Bell Park in 1934, in recognition of Mrs Emily Jane Bell and her late husband Mr William Irving Bell and their role in organising the opening up and maintenance of the park. By the end of the 1940s, the days of large, company and community picnics had become well established. The annual picnics of the Central Queensland Meat Export Company at Lakes Creek and the Railways Department at Rockhampton, developed into huge proportions. The Mount Morgan community, particularly those associated with the mine also showed much support for Emu Park as it was the only resort on the coast that was easily accessible by train. Earlier in Emu Park's history, Mount Morgan Limited had arranged for picnics for employees, however these ceased after 1927. By 1949, when a social club run by employees was established, picnics of the mine employees continued once again. The social club developed its annual picnic at Bell Park, often with 3000 or more people attending. An advance party of four would arrive at Emu Park three days before to prepare the ground and other necessary arrangements for marquees, races and catering. On the day of the picnic, which was generally near the May Day weekend, the first train left Mount Morgan at dawn, with the last train returning by midnight. A section of Bell Park with a long, grassed area is suggested to be the area where races were held. The races were called by a person located in a nearby timber tower. On 3 August 1950, the Botanic Gardens proclamation was rescinded in favour of a Park and Recreation Reserve (R666) and a Camping and Recreation Reserve in two parts (R665 - which now comprises Lots 31 and 92). A caravan park is now established on Lot 31 and controlled by Livingstone Shire Council as is a swimming pool complex. Recently in a study on open spaces and recreation areas in the Livingstone Shire, it was recommended that areas of cultural significance and high scenic value be protected. As one of the most popular parks in the Livingstone Shire, Bell Park is included in this study.  Description  The Botanic Garden remnant known as Bell Park consists of Park and Recreation Reserve. The Park is an area of bounded on the south by Hill Street, to the west by the caravan park and swimming complex, to the north by Lions Park and to the east by the Pacific Ocean. No longer a densely vegetated area as it was described in the 1890s, Bell Park has large, open, grassed areas with some more formally planted rows of hoop pines, particularly in the southern section of the park. Access to Bell Park is from Hill Street with low timber fencing marking the car park area from the remainder of the park. Bell Park contains a range of mature pines on the eastern border [sea side] and open grassed areas. Other areas of mature vegetation include hoop pines along the Hill Street entrance to the park; pines and coconut palms in the south- west corner; along the western boundary near the caravan park and particularly, in the northern end of the park, an area that generally, has less infrastructure than the remainder of the reserve. Structures within Bell Park include a timber tower thought to be a judges box/starters box, near this structure is a large, open grassed area said to be a runners track; two timber rotundas, one constructed with tree trunks for uprights, while the second rotunda has uprights made from sawn timber. A timber stall is located to the north of the timber tower and located near this stall is a large, mature ficus sp. Bell Park has other facilities available including toilets, play equipment, footbridges and concrete pathways for pedestrian access. A brick stage with a concreted area is also located in the park.  Heritage listing  Bell Park was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 29 April 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Bell Park is significant for its continued use as a cultural and recreational destination at Emu Park, which was established as a resort town for the people of Rockhampton and surrounding areas in the 1860s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Further, the judges box and the associated running track are particularly significant for their rarity. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. With its mature vegetation and landscaped areas, built structures including timber rotundas and judges box, and its sweeping easterly views toward the Pacific Ocean, Bell Park is significant for its visual amenity and for the contribution it makes to the Emu Park townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Bell Park is especially important for its strong social significance. For over 100 years, the area has held a special association with the people of Emu Park and surrounding area, with the community actively involved in the gazettal of the original densely vegetated area in the early 1890s, through to the activities of the Emu Park Progress Association and Emu Park Ladies Improvement League and later, when large company and community picnics were held in the grounds of the park. Bell Park is generally held in high regard by the community and is a popular place for visitors to Emu Park.

Hellespontine Phrygia () or Lesser Phrygia () was a Persian satrapy (province) in northwestern Anatolia, directly southeast of the Hellespont. Its capital was Dascylium, and for most of its existence it was ruled by the hereditary Persian Pharnacid dynasty. Together with Greater Phrygia, it made up the administrative provinces of the wider Phrygia region. History The Polyxena sarcophagus from Hellespontine Phrygia, in Late Greek Archaic style, 520-500 BC. √áanakkale Archaeological Museum. The satrapy was created in the beginning of the fifth century BC, during the time of administrative reorganisations of the territories in western Asia Minor, which were amongst the most important Achaemenid territories. The first Achaemenid ruler of Hellespontine Phrygia was Mitrobates (ca. 525‚Äì522 BC), who was appointed by Cyrus the Great and continued under Cambises. He was killed and his territory absorbed by the satrap of neighbouring Lydia, Oroetes. Following the reorganization of Darius I, Mitrobates was succeeded by Oebares II (c.493), son of Megabazus. Artabazus then became satrap circa 479 BC and started the Pharnacid dynasty, which would rule Hellespontine Phrygia until the conquests of Alexander the Great (338 BC). As Alexander the Great was conquering and incorporating the Achaemenid Empire, he appointed Calas, a Macedonian General to govern Hellespontine Phrygia in 334 BC, after he had sent Parmenion to secure Dascylium, the provincial capital. Calas, being the very first non-Achaemenid ruler of the province, was awarded the Persian title of \\"satrap\\", rather than a Macedonian title, and Alexander instructed him to collect the same tribute from his subjects that had been paid to Darius III. After Alexander's death in 323, the satrapy was awarded to Leonnatus, who was killed in action in the Lamian War. The region was seized by Lysimachus, was added to the Seleucid Empire after the Battle of Corupedium (281 BC), and was finally integrated in the Bithynian kingdom.

Edited by Bahadur Singh, it was completed in 1834 CE in Lucknow.  Authorship and date  Bahadur Singh was originally a resident of Gondiwal pargana in Shahjahanabad (otherwise known as Old Delhi). He was the son of Hazari Mal, who belonged to Bhatnagar clan of the Kayastha caste. He mentions that he was forced to leave Shahjahanbad due to circumstances, and arrived in Lucknow in 1817, under \\"great distress\\". At that time, Lucknow was ruled by Ghazi-ud-Din Haidar. At Lucknow, Bahadur Singh read several Hindi and Persian language works on history. He was inspired to write a connected history based on all these works. He finished the work on the first day of Ramazan in 1249 A.H. (12 January 1834 CE). Bahadur Singh states that he has only copied content from other books, and organized it into an encyclopedia. But according to Charles Rieu he evidently added original content, especially on the later history of Awadh and Bengal. The detailed account of the Nawabs of Awadh, their families and their ministers is unique to this encyclopedia among other contemporary works. For some reason, Bahadur Singh strongly resented Kashmiri people. In his book, Singh describes rape and murder of Kashmiri Hindus by Muslims over the centuries. He states that under Aurangzeb's rule, the total weight of sacred threads collected from Hindus forcibly converted to Islam was 10 seers. He further states that many of these later converted back to Hinduism. Singh's account does not aim to present Muslims as savages, rather to present Kashmiris as a group more degraded than mlecchas because of their illegitimacy. He urges other people to not only avoid Kashmiris, but destroy them. According to Christopher Bayly, as a lowly clerk, he was envious of the success of his Kashmiri rivals. Henry Miers Elliot suggests that he might have lost a job to a Kashmiri.

Biography  = Early life = Romana Javitz was born in Russia to Polish parents and immigrated to America in 1906. Her mother, Malvine, was a hat milliner and her father, Elias, maintained an import/export business. She grew up in the Bronx and the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She studied painting at the Art Student's League and began working at the New York Public Library (NYPL) in the Children's Room in 1919. = Career = Javitz was interested in how libraries and museums documented folk art and brought attention to the documentation of African-American folk art at the NYPL after viewing European cities documentation in the 1920s. In 1929, she became superintendent of the Picture Collection at the NYPL. She held the position until she retired in 1968. In the 1930s she assisted Arthur Alfonso Schomburg, Curator of the Library's Division of Negro History, Literature and Prints, by reviewing the collection to find important prints, photographs, and plates of African-American subjects. During her tenure, she instituted important innovations including requesting pictures with drawings on a call slip to locate the material and streamlined the process of adding new materials to the library with a team of artists and catalog card index. In 1935, Javitz worked with Ruth Reeves, to create the Index of American Design that was part of the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project. The project was founded in the idea that modern designers, like Reeves, were unable to find visual resources from American material culture at libraries and other institutions. Javitz and Reeves hired unemployed artists and illustrators around the county to record the decorative arts of rural and urban regions of the U.S. The collection was later moved to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. In 1936, Roy Stryker, head of the Farm Security Administration's Photographic Section, consulted Javitz about the organization of the Resettlement Administration files. Javitz saw the importance of the project and visited with Stryker in Washington, D.C. to work with him on all the new photographs and organize them into a cohesive collection. In 1944, Javitz worked with the acting Librarian of Congress, Luther Evans, at the Library of Congress to establish pictorial standards for the Farm Security Administration's photography project. Stryker also sent Javitz duplicate prints to ensure their future in New York City until he got assurance they would be preserved in Washington, D.C. After World War II, Javitz kept acquiring work, making it the NYPL of the few institutions to take on contemporary work. In 1967, she was awarded the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA).  Death and legacy  Javitz died in 1980. In 1998, the NYPL commemorated her role at the library by creating an exhibition Subject Matters: Photography, Romana Javitz and the New York Public Library, curated by Julia Van Haaften and Anthony Troncale, that showcases some of the notable photographs she acquired during her tenure. In 2008, the library's curator of photography, Stephen Pinson, organized an exhibit which included some of the works Javitz helped to preserve, in a show called Eminent Domain: Contemporary Photography and the City.

He grew up in B√∫√∞ardalur and moved at the age of 15 to Reykjav√≠k. He studied Fine Arts and Crafts from 1971 to 1976, after which he went to The Hague and studied at De Vrije Academie (1976‚Äì77) and then at the Jan van Eyck Academie in Maastricht. He returned to Iceland when his studies were finished in 1979. In a monograph by Elena Pontiggia, the artist's work was described as \\"northern, polar fairytales, full of fish and walrus, crossed by ice sheets and clouds, where unexpected water springs appear and there is an uninterrupted limbo of angels and birds chirping.\\" Helgi represented Iceland at the Venice Biennale in 1990.A Brief Look Back: Icelandic Participation at the Venice Biennale , LIST Icelandic Art News, 28 February 2007. Untitled watercolour, 2014, by artist Helgi Fri√∞j√≥nsson Painting Helgi has worked with drawings, graphics, sculpture and text. In his initial paintings, done while he was a student in the Netherlands, he complied with all the rules that were followed at the time. They struck him as overcomplicated and he elected to simplify things. He began to \\"transfer the sketch onto canvas, i.e. to think directly in the painting.\\" He says he works images rapidly and that they are based on concepts connecting them to particular time periods. Helgi was one of the painters involved at the beginning of the New Painting movement that was launched in Iceland in 1980. He first showed oil paintings in Gallery Leechers Street 7 in 1980, and then at the Nordic House in 1981. He also took part in large exhibitions like \\"New Painting\\" at The Living Art Museum and the \\"Gold Coast Spirit\\" exhibition held at the JL-House in 1983. The last two exhibitions garnered considerable publicity and shook up the Icelandic art community. It was at an exhibition at the Kjarvalssta√∞ir branch of the Reykjav√≠k Art Museum in 1987 that Helgi first received widespread recognition for his work. Helgi began to paint figurative characters, which have since characterized his painting, around 1987; this was seen in paintings in his Kjarvalssta√∞ir exhibition and others thereafter. The figures most characteristically depicted in his landscapes are centaurs and angels. Helgi extensively references legends and stories in ways that take on surreal undertones, but the work is never formally surrealistic. Gunnar B. Kvaran says in a book about Helgi published by the Reykjav√≠k Art Museum in 1989 that the idea and the subject have always played an equally important role in the formal implementation of his inspirations. Helgi says that he works with the solitary person in his paintings. This can, for example, be seen in the people and other figures who almost never touch, with eyes never meeting, so that the figures seem barely to know each other. He reinforces this theme by painting women as well as men naked and without appeal to sexuality. Solitude is absolute.

During the initial demonstrations, a Muslim prayer hall was burned down and Qur'ans were set alight. Further protests were organised after the initial march despite a government ban on protests until 4 January 2016. The protesters claimed to be acting in revenge for an incident that occurred the day prior when firefighters and police were assaulted in the neighbourhood of Jardins de l'Empereur; however, outside observers labeled the ensuing riots as anti-Arab and anti-Muslim. The Corsican nationalist politicians have claimed their view does not legitimise xenophobia, blaming the protest on French nationalism instead. Scholarly opinions on this claim are divided. Background Over the past several decades, Corsican nationalists have been calling for the island's recognition as a nation since French annexation. Following years of violence by the FLNC (stopped in 2014), a referendum on increased devolution failed by a narrow majority. The Corsican language is also labeled as a \\"definitely endangered language\\" by UNESCO. While racial tensions linger, in the December 2015 French regional elections in Corsica, the pro-autonomy party P√® a Corsica got 35.34% of the vote, winning 24 seats out of 51. Gilles Simeoni, already mayor of Bastia, said: \\"It's a victory for Corsica and all the Corsicans. My first thoughts go to all those early campaigners who have battled for our cause for half a century ‚Äì among them the youngsters, some of whom are in prison. It's a victory for an alternative policy to that which has failed Corsicans for decades. [Corsicans had a] thirst for democracy, economic development and social justice.\\" The leader of the pro-independence group Corsica Libera, Jean-Guy Talamoni, added: \\"It's been a 40-year-long march to arrive here. Corsica is not just a French administrative constituency ‚Äì it's a country, a nation, a people.\\" He further noted the result of \\"those who have never accepted French rule... and have never ceased to fight for the survival of the Corsican nation\\" and also called for amnesty for \\"political prisoners\\" and \\"those still in hiding.\\" Negotiations were imminent for the creation of a single Corsican region by 2018 that would merge the executive with its two d√©partements. Republicans leader Nicolas Sarkozy said before the vote that \\"Mr Talamoni does not want the French Republic? Well, the French Republic does not want Mr Talamoni. This is France.\\" Following the election, the former FLNC's Jean-Pierre Susini said: \\"This is the culmination of 40 years of struggle. I have always called for independence but after 200 years of (French) colonialism...the nationalists have an enormous amount of work to do.\\" He added: \\"We have only two years before us. We must not disappoint, otherwise the valets of colonialism will take back control.\\" The election was said to play a part in the rise of nationalist sentiment. Arson and protests On 24 December in the poor neighbourhood of Jardins de l'Empereur, firefighters were ambushed by unidentified \\"hooded youths\\" with iron bars and baseball bats, resulting in injuries to two firefighters and a police officer. A local official, Fran√ßois Lalanne, said a fire was deliberately lit in the area and when the emergency services arrived they were attacked. An unnamed fireman said that about 20 men tried to break the windows of their truck with bars and bats. According to Corse Matin, the firefighters were told \\"Sales Corses de merde, cassez-vous, vous n'√™tes pas chez vous ici!\\" (Dirty shitty Corsicans, go fuck yourselves, you are not in your home here!). On 25 December, a Muslim prayer hall in Jardins de l'Empereur was burned with at least part of a Quran set on fire. It was raided by crowds the next day after accusations that the firefighters were attacked by local Arab residents. On 27 December, following the initial arson, as well as a consequent protest ban, several hundred people marched in Corsica, though they avoided the affected neighbourhood, instead rallying in other areas. Previous marches had seen slogans such as : \\"Arabs get out!\\" On the day, they also rejected accusations that their rally was racist and chanted: \\"We fight against scum, not against Arabs!\\" and \\"We aren't thugs, we aren't racists!\\" Police were also deployed around Jardins de l'Empereur, home to many immigrants, to prevent any clashes. Arrests Two men in their 20s were arrested for the initial attack and were due to be charged. Reactions =Politics= Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the attack was \\"an unacceptable desecration,\\" while Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve pledged that the perpetrators of the attacks on the firefighters and the prayer hall would be identified and arrested. He further commented that there was no place for \\"racism and xenophobia\\" in France. The French Council of the Muslim Faith denounced the violence. A ban was issued on protests in the mostly Muslim neighbourhood until at least 4 January 2016. President of the Corsican Assembly Jean-Guy Talamoni blamed the \\"imported\\" ideology of the National Front and claimed the protests and arson were anethema to Corsican nationalism, which had established the Corsican Republic. He also said the perpetrators tended to support the National Front and were not nationalists. In response the National Front issued a statement that read \\"the unacceptable violence which shook Ajaccio on 25 December is the unfortunately expected consequence of lax and weak politics, which leaves neighbourhoods to become no-go areas where representatives of the emergency services are assaulted daily.\\" Corsica's administrator Christophe Mirmand said: \\"This behaviour must stop. It hurts Corsica's image.\\" =Religion= Olivier de Germay, Bishop of Ajaccio, condemned the violence, stating that \\"those who commit violent acts in the name of the Christian faith are fooling themselves.\\" =Academia= Eug√®ne Gherardi, a professor of Corsican culture and history, shares the view that xenophobic forms of nationalism reached the island through the National Front. However, Emmanuel Martin of the Institute for Economic Studies in Europe noted that the protesters were chanting in Corsican and displaying the island's flag, theorising that the alleged xenophobia would be stronger in Corsica where some locals already believe that their homeland has been colonised by the French.

He was implicated, if not as the organiser, then at least as the spirit behind the assassinations of Lord Frederick Cavendish and Under Secretary Thomas Henry Burke in the Phoenix Park murders of 6 May 1882. He was one of only two who managed to flee Ireland to escape prosecution for the crime. His escape was the source of much legal wrangling in Ireland, France, and the United States. Personal life and career Byrne was born in Ireland in 9 November 1848.www.findagrave.com/memorial/19912872/Frank-Byrne Byrne memorial stone, Old Saint Mary's Cemetery, Pawtucket RI He participated in the failed Rising at Tallaght in 1867. He was married to Mary Ann Monneypenny and had two children. Mrs. Byrne's sympathies lay with her husband and she was an active participant his activities. Irish patriot Frank Byrne was an aide to Charles Stewart Parnell and secretary of the Irish Home Rule League and the Irish National Land League. Although he was an ardent supporter of the goals of both Irish home rule and the abolishment of landlordism in Ireland, he became much more of a revolutionist and opposed to Parnell's methods of negotiation. After the Coercion Act of 1881, designed to quell the Irish farmers, led to the arrest of Parnell, Byrne and a number of like-minded Land Leaguers banded together as the Irish National Invincibles who believed in violent ideas to combat the British administrators. Phoenix Park Murders On 6 May 1882 two members of the British Government in Ireland, Chief Secretary for Ireland Lord Frederick Cavendish and the Under-Secretary for Ireland T.H. Burke, were stabbed to death in Phoenix Park, Dublin, by members of the Invincibles. Although twenty-one conspirators were arrested and tried, the leaders of the Invincibles, including Frank Byrne, had not been located or detained. Mrs. Byrne was believed to be the woman who brought to Dublin the surgical knives with which the Phoenix Park murders were committed. She was arrested but subsequently released when she was unable to be identified by the informant James Carey. These knives, it was stated, had been lying for some time in the London offices of the Irish National League of Great Britain. Escape After the murders, Byrne escaped to Paris. Parnell was said to have given Byrne ¬£100 to finance the escape, but Parnell continued to deny his involvement in the Invincibles and any of their activities. Byrne was arrested in Paris, but soon released. He had served in an Irish company attached to one of the French regiments in the army under Bourbaki during the Franco-Prussian War and had received several medals for meritorious conduct. He claimed this was the reason for his release. Life in America Upon being freed, he immigrated to New York, arriving on 28 March 1883. In New York, Byrne took an active part in the propaganda of Fenianism. At a meeting in New York on 2 July 1883, he justified the Phoenix Park murders: > \\" I am not fastidious as to the methods by which the cause of liberty may be > advanced. I do not say you should alone use dynamite, or the knife, or the > rifle, or parliamentary agitation, but I hold no Irishman true who will not > use all and each method as the opportunity presents itself.\\" He died in Providence, Rhode Island, on 16 February 1894.\\"Rhode Island Deaths and Burials, 1802‚Äì1950,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F8ZD-GQX : 6 December 2014), Francis Byrne, 16 February 1894; citing Providence, Providence, Rhode Island, reference ; FHL microfilm 2,023,189.His wife survived him a few months.Byrne memorials in Rhode Island References External links Category:1848 births Category:1894 deaths Category:Irish nationalists Category:Irish rebels Category:Irish republicans Category:Irish revolutionaries Category:Members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood ","title":"Frank Byrne (Irish nationalist)"},{"id":"48926677","text":"Cristo Rey Dallas College Prep is a coeducational, Catholic, college preparatory school and a member of the Cristo Rey Network that follows the work-study model of education.

The explosion, which occurred at approximately 02:05 local time, wounded two airport cleaners, one of whom later died after being taken to hospital. Flights from the terminal resumed as normal while Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m, the Minister of Transport, Maritime and Communication, claimed that there had been no security lapses at the airport. Witnesses initially claimed that they heard three successive blasts, though their cause was unknown and investigators refused to rule out terrorism as a motive. The Daily Telegraph claimed that the blast was most likely caused by a bomb. The explosion occurred while the Turkish military had been continuing its armed operations against Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants in the south-east of the country, causing unrest and tensions between Kurdish citizens and the Turkish state ever since a ceasefire and peace negotiations between the two sides broke down in July 2015. On 27 December 2015, three days after the attack, the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK) claimed responsibility for the explosion, announcing that it was a result of a mortar bombing in retaliation for the Turkish Army's continued military operations in Kurdish populated cities in the south-east. The TAK is an urban-based offshoot of the PKK. The attacker was arrested on 28 October 2017 in Istanbul. Explosion The explosion was heard at approximately 02:05 EEST on 23 December 2015, though eyewitnesses claimed that they heard three successive blasts. Initial investigations did not show clear evidence of terrorism, though the Ministry of Transport, Maritime and Communication stated there were no weaknesses in the airport's security. The Daily Telegraph held an interview with an aviation expert in regards to the blast, who speculated that the explosion had been caused by a bomb. It was claimed in the interview that an interior mechanical fault within a plane would not cause a blast big enough to damage five other planes in the vicinity. The damage to the five planes was attributed to shrapnel caused by a bombing. Impact and casualties Two cleaning workers on the site were wounded, with one of them, Zeyhra Yama√ß, later dying from head injuries caused by the blast. The Minister of Transport, Maritime and Communication, Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m, said that the explosion had damaged five planes, which were later taken to hangars for repair. Flights out of the airport continued despite the explosion. Perpetrators On 27 December 2015, the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK) claimed responsibility for the explosion and declared that the blast had been due to a mortar bomb. The TAK gave their motive to be the ongoing 'fascist' military operations by the Turkish Armed Forces in mainly Kurdish-populated south-eastern cities, designed to combat PKK militants in the region. The attacker was arrested on 28 October 2017 in Istanbul.

Air power was a major component of the battle, with the United States and other nations conducting over 850 airstrikes in the Ramadi area from July 2015 to late February 2016,38 (Jan. 2‚Äì8) + 28 (Jan. 9‚Äì15) + 44 (Jan. 16‚Äì22) + 40 (Jan. 23‚Äì29) + 33 (Jan. 29 ‚Äì Feb. 5) + 25 (Feb. 6‚Äì12) + 20 (Feb. 13‚Äì19) = 228+ airstrikes (Jan. 2 ‚Äì Feb. 19) and the US crediting airstrikes with 80% of the reason why the city was recaptured. By February 2016, Iraqi forces successfully recaptured the city after two and a half months of fighting. It was predicted that it would take several months to clear the city of the bombs ISIL left behind, with at least 9 months needed to clear the city's Tamim District. At the time, Ramadi had suffered more damage than any other city or town in Iraq. Background =ISIL capture of Ramadi= On May 17, 2015, ISIL captured the city of Ramadi, after launching multiple waves of suicide attacks during a sandstorm, which caused Iraqi forces to retreat from the city. =Anbar offensive= On the dawn of July 13, the Iraqi Army, backed by the Shiite and Sunni pro-government militias, launched an offensive to recapture Anbar province. The Iraqi forces also reportedly pushed towards Ramadi from the west and the south. By afternoon, the Iraqi Army retook the Ramadi Olympic stadium in western Ramadi and reached the eastern part of the city. According to Iraqi officials, pro-government fighters also pushed the extremists from the areas east of Ramadi. On August 11, a senior official with the US-led coalition said that Iraqi forces had surrounded the city and were preparing for a final assault to retake it. On August 26, ISIL suicide bombers killed two Iraqi army generals and three soldiers north of Fallujah. Maj. Gen. Abdul-Rahman Abu-Regheef, deputy chief of operations in Anbar, and Brig. Gen. Safeen Abdul-Majid, commander of the 10th Army Division were both killed. By late September, the operation to retake Ramadi was considered to have stalled, with Iraqi Security Forces positioned on the outskirts of Ramadi, but unable to mount an incursion into the city proper. Political squabbles between Iranian backed militias and the Abadi administration were also hampering potential offensives. On September 25, the United States urged the Iraqi Army to hasten the operation, acknowledging that \\"...the Iraqis have not made any significant forward movement recently.\\" In early October, Iraqi forces renewed their operations in Ramadi, capturing several areas to the north and west, including the main road west of Ramadi. By October 13, Iraqi troops had advanced 15 kilometers and encircled the city, according to US officials. In mid-November, Iraqi forces recaptured the emergency directorate headquarters in Ramadi. The battle =Completing the siege= On November 25, 2015, the Iraqi Army launched the offensive to retake Ramadi, cutting ISIL's last supply line into the city of Ramadi, via the Euphrates River, by seizing the strategic Palestine Bridge. The operation at Palestine Bridge and other areas in northwestern Ramadi were supported by 7 Coalition airstrikes. On November 29, the Iraqi Army began dropping leaflets into Ramadi, warning of an imminent offensive and warning civilians to flee. However, only a few families managed to flee, since ISIL had closed off the corridor in southeastern Ramadi designated by the Iraqi Government, and ISIL also locked down the city, threatening to kill anyone who tried to escape. =Battle for the city center= On December 4, Iraqi forces began advancing towards Ramadi's southwestern Tamim District, from the Anbar University and Tash District areas.Control Map of Ramadi, Dec 22, 2015 On December 8, Iraqi forces pushed into Ramadi city for the first time since the beginning of the offensive, capturing Tamim, a key district in the southwestern area of Ramadi, separated from the rest of Ramadi city by the al-Waar River, a tributary of the Euphrates. The Iraqi Army also recaptured the Anbar Operation Control Center, near the Palestine Bridge. The battle was claimed to be a resounding success, with Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service spokesman Sabah al-Numani telling the AFP news agency that after troops launched their assault on Tamim, ISIL militants \\"had no choice except to surrender or fight\\" and that they were \\"completely destroyed\\". After the advances, the Iraqi Government claimed that it had recaptured 60% of the Ramadi area from ISIL, although most of the city proper still remained under ISIL control. During the operation to capture the Tamim District, 350 ISIL militants were killed by US-led Coalition airstrikes. On December 10, ISIL forces blew up the Warrar Dam,ISIS Destroys Bridge as Iraqi Forces Close in on Ramadi 10 December 2015. which linked the Anbar Operations Control Center to northwestern Ramadi city, leaving the Qassim Bridge as the last working bridge in Ramadi, which runs from al-Tamim into the southern al- Humaira District. On December 15, two RAF Typhoon FGR4s supported the Iraqi army in its operations around Ramadi, and struck an ISIL encampment with two Paveway IVs. The next day, RAF Tornados assisted the Iraqi troops battling ISIL on the outskirts of Ramadi, and used Paveway IVs to destroy heavy machine-gun positions, a sniper team and a group of fighters. On 18 December 2015, the 55th Brigade of the Iraqi Armed Forces called in a U.S airstrike to cover their advance because their army helicopters would not fly due to bad weather. The airstrike misfired by a few kilometers and hit the Iraqi army, killing 9 soldiers including one officer and army commander. Later on December 20, a second pair of GR4s flew a reconnaissance mission over Ramadi, where they provided surveillance assistance to an attack by other Coalition aircraft. On December 20, Iraqi planes also dropped leafets into Ramadi again, warning civilians to leave the city within 72 hours. On December 22, Iraqi forces advanced into the center of the city of Ramadi, and headed towards the main government complex. The 3-pronged attack was launched from al-Tamim and al-Humaira Districts in the southwest and south, northwards into the central al-Hoz District, and the Andalus and al-Malab Districts further east.Control Map of Ramadi City Center, Dec 22, 2015 Iraqi forces had constructed a temporary bridge over the al-Warrar River, allowing them to cross over into the southern Hoz District, where they reportedly surprised the ISIL forces there.Iraqi Army Launches Offensive to Retake Ramadi Two pairs of RAF Tornados and an RAF Reaper, provided the Iraqis with continuous close air support alongside other coalition aircraft. When ISIL fighters fired rocket- propelled grenades and small arms at Iraqi soldiers tending to wounded personnel, the Tornados intervened with a very accurate Paveway strike. The Reaper, meanwhile, assisted other Coalition aircraft in an attack that destroyed an anti-aircraft gun. Fighting continued the next day, while Iraqi reinforcements, including US-trained Sunni tribal fighters were sent to secure the recaptured parts of Ramadi, in order to allow the first wave of troops to continue pushing toward the government complex in the city centre. On December 23, 2 flights of RAF Tornado GR4s were contributing to the coalition air effort which supported the Iraqi army's offensive into the centre of Ramadi, the Tornados targets included three terrorist teams armed with rocket propelled grenades, a sniper position, an ISIS group in close combat with Iraqi troops, and a large group of at least 17 terrorists, who suffered a direct hit in 6 attacks, again with Paveway IVs. By December 25, Iraqi and allied tribal forces had managed to enter the al-Haouz District, and also were about 500 meters away from the main government complex. RAF Tornados maintained close air support over Ramadi, once again working closely with other coalition aircraft, they used Paveway IVs against 2 terrorist teams, an anti-aircraft gun, and a massed ISIS group who were assembling for an attempted counterattack on the successful Iraqi advance. On December 26, Iraqi forces captured the Ramadi Barrage, in northwestern Ramadi city, and evacuated 120 civilian families from the city. On December 27, the Iraqi Army captured the government complex, after which they declared victory in Ramadi, and claimed to be in full control of the city center. ISIL militants were reported to have fled northeast. However, fighting was still reported southwest of the government complex, as pockets of ISIL resistance remained. On December 28, Iraqi forces completely recaptured the city center of Ramadi, after the remaining ISIL forces withdrew from the government complex and the surrounding areas in the Hoz District. However, on the same day, it was confirmed that ISIL was still in control of 30 percent of the city. On December 29, RAF Typhoons and Tornado GR4s operated over Ramadi, as the Iraqi forces closed in on remaining pockets of ISIL militants. The Typhoons bombed two machine gun positions, while the Tornadoes conducted three attacks on a further two machine gun nests and a strongpoint. Despite bad weather meaning that these attacks had to be carried out through thick cloud and with Iraqi soldiers in close proximity to the targets, careful planning by the aircrew and the precision guidance systems of the Paveway IV bombs allowed all the attacks to be successful without risk to friendly forces. During the week of the final offensive on central Ramadi, an estimated 400 ISIL fighters were killed. =Clearing the city= On December 30, 2015, the Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi visited Ramadi and raised the Iraqi flag at the government complex. During his visit, ISIL forces in a part of the city still under their control fired three mortar rounds at his position; they landed 500 meters away, but the incident forced al-Abadi to leave the area. ISIL casualties during the battle were reportedly high, while Iraqi Army casualties were relatively moderate . Two RAF Tornado GR4s provided close air support over Ramadi, where they bombed machine gun positions engaged in close combat with Iraqi troops, and assisted another coalition aircraft in a strike on an ISIL team armed with rocket propelled grenades. On December 31, ISIL executed 40 civilians who tried to flee the city to areas controlled by the Iraqi Army. On January 3, 2016, ISIL attacked and briefly seized an Iraqi Army base of the 10th Division in Al Tarah, using suicide car bombers and fighters wearing explosive belts. However, the base was retaken by the Iraqi army with the help of coalition airstrikes on the same day. Three Iraqi soldiers were killed and 17 wounded in the attack. Around the same time, the US estimated that there were still 700 ISIL militants holed up in pockets of central and eastern Ramadi, indicating that there were at least 700 more ISIL militants in the city than had been initially estimated;The original estimate of the remaining ISIL forces in Ramadi city was 300 , and 300+ ISIL fighters had been killed in Ramadi in late December 2015 the figure was confirmed by Iraqi officials. RAF Typhoons delivered four successful attacks in Ramadi against terrorist positions, including a mortar team. A second Typhoon mission over Ramadi conducted no less than six attacks, accounting for five machine-guns and a sniper position. On January 3, 2016, the Iraqi Government declared that it had recaptured 80% of Ramadi city, and that the only pockets of ISIL resistance in the city proper remaining were located in the al-Malab and 20th Street areas. On January 4, 2016, a British official stated that the number of ISIL militants remaining in Ramadi had been reduced to around 400 fighters. RAF Tornado GR4s provided close air support to the Iraqi army as they continued their operations to eliminate the remaining terrorist fighters in and around Ramadi. When an Iraqi unit came under rocket-propelled grenade and mortar fire from several ISIL-held buildings, the GR4s conducted accurate strikes on all four buildings using Paveway IVs. The Tornadoes were tasked to deal with a group of terrorists who were preparing for a counter-attack. Despite this being a difficult target for most weapons, the GR4s were able to score a direct hit with a Brimstone missile. An RAF Reaper was also patrolling over Ramadi; it provided surveillance support for three air strikes by coalition fast jets, and also conducted two attacks using its own weapons, employing a GBU-12 laser guided bomb against an ISIL machine-gun team, and destroyed two terrorist trucks with a single Hellfire missile. On January 5, 2016, the Iraqi Army captured the Bruwana District, in the western part of Ramadi. On the same day, the Iraqi Government reported that aerial bombardments in the western part of Ramadi had killed 250 ISIL militants, and destroyed 100 vehicles that were used by ISIL. Later on, it was revealed that ISIL War Minister Dohan al-Rawi had been killed in the bombing, which had followed a five-hour siege on his position. On January 6, ISIL was reported to have detonated large parts of the Ramadi General Hospital, and moved the civilians present to other parts of the city that they controlled, before the arrival of the Iraqi Army. Later on the same day, US Colonel Steve Warren stated that another 60 ISIL militants had been killed in Ramadi in the past day, and that only a handful of \\"squad-size ISIS units\\" remained in Ramadi, numbering no more than 12 militants per group. It was estimated that only 300 ISIL militants remained in Ramadi at that point. On January 7, the Iraqi Army announced that it had recaptured the Ramadi General Hospital and reached the Ramadi Great Mosque. It was also reported that ISIL had detonated the hospital's ground floor.Ramadi, Reclaimed by Iraq, Is in Ruins After ISIS Fight, New York Times, 8 January 2016. Around that time, the Iraqi military slowed down its operations, to try to minimize civilian casualties, as they reported that ISIL was using civilians as human shields. ISIL continued to have a strong presence in the eastern part of the city. On January 8, the Iraqi Army recaptured the al-Malab District in southeastern Ramadi. On the same day, the OHCHR reported that the Iraqi Army had saved 1,000 civilians trapped in Ramadi, who were transferred to refugee camps in Habbaniyah. On the next day, the Iraqi Army recaptured the Andalus District, Ramadi Great Mosque, and Maaref University, in eastern Ramadi. On the same day, a Coalition airstrike reportedly killed 25 ISIL commanders in eastern Ramadi. On January 10, the Iraqi Army rescued another 635 civilians from eastern Ramadi, who were then sent to Habbaniyah. It was also reported that ISIL's control of Ramadi had been reduced to seven districts on the eastern outskirts of Ramadi. However, the bombs left behind by ISIL across Ramadi were slowing down the progress of Iraqi forces in clearing the city, and consequently, most of the city still remained off-limits to civilians. On January 11, the Iraqi Government announced that the Anbar Security Department had been recaptured. On January 12, Iraqi forces evacuated another 250 civilians from the Sajjariyah and al-Sofiyah Districts, on the eastern outskirts of Ramadi. On January 12, it was also reported that ISIL executed several fighters who fled Ramadi, by burning them alive in the town square of Mosul. Later, it was reported that since the offensive for central Ramadi began in late December 2015, 600+ ISIL militants had been killed in the city proper. =Operations slow, clearing the outskirts= On January 13, the Iraqi Army recaptured the al-Sofiyah and Albu Aitha Districts on the eastern outskirts of Ramadi, after giving civilians 2 days to leave the area. At least 30 ISIL militants were killed and 12 others were captured; 10 Iraqi soldiers were killed in the clashes. This left ISIL in control of only the Albu Sawdah, Albu Mahl, Albu Khalifa, Albu Ghanem, and Sajjariyah Districts on the eastern outskirts of Ramadi, where no more than 200 ISIL militants were estimated to be holding out, and where up to 700 families were still being held hostage by ISIL. Later on the same day, Iraqi forces evacuated another 60 families from the recently recaptured al-Sofiyah District. On January 14, the Iraqi Army recaptured the Sura area and Albu Sawdah District on Ramadi's eastern outskirts, killing at least 10 ISIL militants. On the same day, the Iraqi Army evacuated another 800 civilians from the outskirts of eastern Ramadi. On January 15, an Iraqi General stated that his men had moved over 3,000 civilians out of Ramadi during the battle.Militants' use of human shields in Ramadi slows progress On January 16, the Iraqi Army recaptured the Albu Khalifa and Albu Mahl Districts, near al-Sofiyah, killing 15 ISIL militants. On January 17, Iraqi forces fully secured the Greater al-Sofiya District, including the Albu Ghanem neighborhood, which was located in the eastern part of the Greater al-Sofiyah District, leaving the nearby Sajjariyah District as the only district that ISIL controlled in Ramadi. 90 ISIL militants were killed in the clashes that took place throughout the al-Sofiyah District within the previous several days. On the same day, another 117+ ISIL militants were killed in the clashes in eastern Ramadi, as Iraqi forces advanced southeastward from al-Sofiyah and northward from Husaiybah, entering the Sajjariyah District from the north and the south.25 + 21 + 40 + 31 = 117 killed on January 17 12 Iraqi soldiers were killed, along with 13 civilians in the Albu Ghanem District, who were trying to flee ISIL forces. By January 18, over 3,800 civilians had been evacuated from Ramadi by Iraqi forces. On January 20, Iraqi forces began moving eastward to Khalidiya Island, after clearing ISIL-held neighborhoods near the area. On January 21, US Vice President Joe Biden congratulated the Iraqi Security Forces for liberating the city of Ramadi from ISIL control, during a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister al-Abadi. On January 22, Iraqi forces destroyed an ISIL tunnel that linked al- Madiq to Husaiybah, east of Ramadi. On the same day, Iraqi forces entered the Sajjariyah District, as well as ISIL-held areas in the Joabah and Husaiybah Districts, to the east of Ramadi. It was also reported that ISIL resistance in those areas had become weak, and that the civilian families trapped there were located far from the site of the clashes. On 20 January, it was reported that US-led airstrikes in Ramadi, during the battle for the city center in the last week of December 2015, killed 1,036 ISIL militants.U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State grow more lethal in Iraq, USA Today, 20 January 2016. On January 23, ISIL launched suicide attacks in the Kilo 70 area west of Ramadi, and in the Tal Msheheidah east of Ramadi, as well as areas to the north of Ramadi; the ensuing clashes and airstrikes led to the deaths of 62 ISIL militants and 48 Iraqi fighters.Over 100 killed in air strikes, clashes with IS militants in Iraq On January 24, Iraqi Defense Minister said that the Iraqi Army was preparing for an offensive on Mosul, stating that the Iraqi Army and Coalition forces had defeated ISIL in Ramadi. Later on the same day, 190 people suspected of having links ISIL were arrested in Ramadi, and Anbar police Chief Maj. General Hadi Rezeig announced that the Iraqi Security Forces had managed to fully recapture the city of Ramadi. Around the same time, fighting shifted to the Husaiybah District, to the east of Ramadi. Later on January 24, the Anbar Tribal Force reported that during the past two weeks, 700 ISIL militants had been killed in the clashes in Ramadi. The Anbar Tribal Force also said that it was concerned about the fate of a few hundred civilians in Ramadi, who had gone missing during the battle. On January 26, the Iraqi Army found and destroyed the ISIL headquarters in eastern Ramadi, in the al-Sofiyah District, killing at least six ISIL militants. On the same day, the Iraqi Government uncovered a mass grave in central Ramadi, containing the bodies of 40 civilians. On January 27, the Iraqi Army repelled an ISIL suicide attack in the al-Sofiyah District, killing the driver of the car bomb. On the same day, more than a dozen suicide bombers launched two attacks north and west of Ramadi, killing 55 Iraqi soldiers and other pro-government fighters, when ISIL attacked the headquarters of the Iraqi Army's 10th Division and an Army barracks. At this point, it was reported that pockets of ISIL resistance remained in Ramadi's eastern Sajjariyah neighborhood. On January 28, ISIL suicide bombers targeted an Iraqi army division headquarters in the al- Thirthar area of Ramadi. Four were killed in Coalition airstrikes, but two attacked the main gate of the headquarters, killing 17 Iraqi soldiers, including seven officers, and wounding 46 soldiers. Separately, 15 Iraqi soldiers were killed, and 20 were wounded elsewhere in the city, in a combination of suicide attacks, sniper fire, and roadside bombs. On the same day, the Iraqi Government announced that 95% of Ramadi city had been liberated, with the Sajjariyah District being the only part of the city that remained under ISIL control. The last ISIL militants near Ramadi were also said to be holed up in an area between Sajjariyah and Husaiybah. On February 1, the Iraqi Army launched an offensive on the Khalidiya Island area, which is the region located between the villages Albu Nasir and Albu Shajal, situated between Ramadi and Fallujah. On February 2, around 300 ISIL fighters were estimated to be remaining in Ramadi's eastern Sajjariyah District, and in the nearby areas. On February 10, 9 Iraqi soldiers from the army's 8th Division were killed by ISIL shelling, in the Sajjariyah District. Early on February 4, the Iraqi Army entered the central part of the Sajjariyah District, killing more than 17 ISIL militants. Later on the same day, the Iraqi Army recaptured the Sajjariyah District. The 2015‚Äì2016 Battle of Ramadi was the first time since the Fall of Mosul in which the Iraqi Army played the primary role in combating ISIL. =Offensive continues into Husaiybah= On February 7, during a security operation in the al-Sofiyah District in eastern Ramadi, a booby- trapped house exploded, killing 6 Iraqi soldiers and wounding 5 others. On the same day, ISIL executed more civilians in the Juwaybah District, to the east of Ramadi, by firing squad. On February 8, the Iraqi Army recaptured the Juwaybah District, to the east of Ramadi, east of the Sajjariyah District. It was reported that the Iraqi forces killed dozens of ISIL militants and released the civilians that were being held by ISIL in the district. On 9 February, government forces seized the final pocket of ISIL resistance in the Husayba Al-Sharqiyah District, which was the last ISIL-held village to the east of Ramadi, thus fully expelling ISIL from the area of Ramadi.Iraq's Ramadi retaken, but rebuilding it a huge task Dozens of ISIL militants were killed in the clashes in Husaiybah. The Iraqi Army also began evacuating 1,500 civilians from the Husaiybah Al-Sharqiyah District. Afterwards, the Iraqi Government reopened the Ramadi-Habbaniyah Highway. Aftermath On February 2, the Iraqi Army severed the last supply lines between the Khalidiya Island region and the city of Fallujah, completely besieging the city. This led to concerns that an estimated 30,000 civilians trapped in Fallujah would starve, due to the lack of airdropped supplies into the city. On February 4, after Ramadi city was recaptured from ISIL, offensive operations shifted further eastward to the Khalidiya Island area. On February 9, it was reported that ISIL militants were still holed up in some farmlands in Khalidiya Island, to the north of the town of Al Khalidiya. On February 10, it was reported that the Iraqi Army had fully recaptured the Khalidiya District, including the Khalidiya Island area. On February 13, it was reported that the Iraqi Security Forces had removed 300 IEDs from the area between eastern Ramadi and Khalidiya. On February 14, an Iraqi airstrike killed an ISIL commander in the Kartan area of the Khalidiya District, along with 14 other ISIL militants. Later on the same day, the Iraqi Government reported that the Sedikiyah area in the eastern Khalidiya District was ready for the return of displaced civilians, after IEDs left behind by ISIL in the area had been dismantled. It was predicted that it would take several months to fully clear Ramadi of the bombs left behind by ISIL; at least 9 months would be needed to clear the Tamim District alone without additional funds. It was also reported that as of thus far, Ramadi had suffered more damage than any other town or city in Iraq. On February 16, a mass grave containing the bodies of 50 civilians was uncovered in the al-Sofiya District of eastern Ramadi. On the same day, the Iraqi Army launched a clearing operation in the Hamidiyah District, to the northeast of Ramadi's Albu Ghanem District. On February 19, the Iraqi Army completely cleared the Hamidiyah District from ISIL forces, killing dozens of ISIL fighters. On February 18, a large number of local Sunni tribesmen revolted against ISIL, after ISIL beat a woman, among other restrictive practices enforces by ISIL's Al-Hisbah secret police, amid an ongoing siege. ISIL was reported to have withdrawn into Fallujah city, after local Sunnis burned the Al-Hisbah headquarters and clashes spread. On February 20, it was estimated that only 1,000 civilians were living in and around the Ramadi area, after the fierce clashes that erupted during the battle for the city. On February 20, the clashes began to die down as ISIL began carrying out mass arrests, and it was reported that there were still some Sunni fighters who were pinned down in parts of Fallujah, who would likely be massacred if the Iraqi Government or the US-led Coalition does not intervene. On February 21, the US-led Coalition bombed an ISIL gathering in Khalidiya Island, killing 7 ISIL leaders. On the same day, the Iraqi Army began shelling ISIL positions on the outskirts of Fallujah, in support of the Sunni tribal fighters. Late on February 21, ISIL crushed the revolt, and detained 180 men. However, on the same day, the Iraqi Army deployed reinforcements to Fallujah, in preparation to storm the city. On February 23, the Iraqi Army fully recaptured the town of Al-Karmah, after they destroyed ISIL's last stronghold in the town. On February 27, Anbar Provincial Council announced that 15 members of the Iraqi army and police were killed during the dismantling of improvised explosive devices and booby-trapped houses in Ramadi. On February 28, Iraqi government forces repelled a massive ISIL suicide attack in Abu Ghraib and western Baghdad, which was the largest attack carried out by the group in the area in nearly 2 years. The assault left 30 ISIL militants and 30 Iraqi soldiers dead. Eventually, on 26 June 2016 the Iraqi Army fully recaptured Al-Fallujah and an Iraqi commander declared it 'fully liberated' from ISIS. USA support and future tactics With 80% of Ramadi left in ruins after months of heavy bombing, as well as scorched earth tactics employed by ISIL, the US and its allies allocated over $50 million to rebuild the city. Due to the offensive's success, the tactics of encirclement and airstrikes used in Ramadi were applied to Fallujah, which was captured by ISIS in January 2014.

Description The whitish to greyish-brown fruitbodies of Disciseda bovista are roughly spherical, measuring in diameter and tall. The base of mature fruitbodies is cushioned by a thick pad of mycelium encrusted with soil and plant debris. There is an irregularly shaped (and often torn) opening (ostiole) at the top of the fruitbody, usually 1‚Äì2 mm in diameter. The inside of the fruitbody contains the brown gleba, which is initially cottony before becoming powdery after the spores mature. The spores are strongly ornamented, and measure 6‚Äì7 ¬µm. Disciseda candida is quite similar in appearance, but has smaller spores (3.5‚Äì5.5 Œºm) with finer surface ornamentation. Habitat and distribution Disciseda bovista grows on the ground in sunny, dry, and sandy locales that are often steppe-like. It is found in North America and Europe.

He is a Professor in the Philosophy Department at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, NS and an author. Prior to his current position he taught Philosophy at several Universities and Colleges across Canada including: University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier University, Okanagan University-College, Humber College, Trent University, University of Prince Edward Island, and York University.https://louisgroarke.com/pdf/louis-groarke-curriculum- vitae-2015.pdf Groarke's writings in philosophy have focussed upon Ethics, Logic, Political Philosophy and Aesthetics. His work characteristically draws upon his broad knowledge of the history of Western philosophy, especially the thought of Aristotle, with a view to applying this to address problems in contemporary philosophy. Main Contributions Louis Groarke's first book The Good Rebel addresses the tendency of contemporary philosophers to overly separate freedom from morality and rationality. On this model, morality and rationality appear to be constraints upon freedom. Through the presentation of a vast array of figures in the philosophical tradition, Groarke shows that this contemporary view is a deviation from a broadly held consensus that far from being at odds with morality and rationality, freedom actually presupposes these goods. According to this view, which Groarke defends, one cannot be authentically free without being both rational and good.Groarke, \\"The Good Rebel\\", Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, (December 2002). Subsequently, Groarke has authored a significant textbook and many academic articles on ethics developing this historical methodology.Louis Groarke, \\"Moral Reasoning: Rediscovering the Ethical Tradition,\\" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011). His work in Logic also develops this methodology of applying lessons from the history of philosophy to offer revisionary accounts of philosophical ideas that have come to be taken for granted in much of the current philosophical discourse. In his work \\"An Aristotelian Account of Induction: Creating Something from Nothing\\" Groarke critiques the orthodox view of Inductive logic that has been widely held since David Hume, according to whom inductive inferences can never be certain as the conclusion always extends beyond the number of observed cases.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction- problem/#HumInd Drawing on an Aristotelian distinction between knowledge and insight Groarke argues that sense experience can in cases give insight into the fundamental nature of a thing in a way that grounds knowledge of the universal. This alternative highlights that it is Hume's presumption of nominalism that grounds his account of the problem of induction. Defending an Aristotelian form of essentialism Groarke argues for an account of induction that is non-fallacious and in some of its forms capable of rising to genuine knowledge.Louis Groarke, \\"An Aristotelian Account of Induction,\\" McGill- Queen's University Press, 2009. =Books published= Louis Groarke, The Good Rebel: Understanding Morality and Freedom, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2002. * Louis Groarke, An Aristotelian Account of Induction, McGill- Queen's University Press, 2009. * Jonathan Lavery and Louis Groarke (Editors), Literary Form, Philosophical Content, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2010. * Louis Groarke, Moral Reasoning: Rediscovering the Ethical Tradition, Oxford University Press, 2011. * Jonathan Lavery, Louis Groarke, and William Sweet, Ideas Under Fire: Historical Studies of Philosophy and Science in Adversity, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2012. * Paolo C.

It is approximately long and flows through Delano Township, Mahanoy Township, and Mahanoy City. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek is designated as an impaired waterbody due to sedimentation/siltation and water/flow variation from abandoned mine drainage. The creek is relatively small, an ephemeral stream in its lower reaches, and is located within the Western Middle Anthracite Field. The watershed of North Mahanoy Creek is in the upper part of the Mahanoy Creek drainage basin. It is one of the major tributaries of Mahanoy Creek. A number of bridge have been constructed over North Mahanoy Creek. The creek's watershed is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. It has a few macroinvertebrate taxa, but no fish. However, wild trout naturally reproduce in two of its unnamed tributaries. Course North Mahanoy Creek begins on Bear Head in Delano Township. It flows southwest for a few tenths of a mile before turning south and flowing along the border of the census-designated place of Delano. The creek then enters a valley and turns west-southwest for a few miles, almost immediately entering Mahanoy Township. Further downstream, it receives three unnamed tributaries from the right. The creek then turns southwest for several tenths of a mile, receiving another unnamed tributary from the right before turning south and then south-southeast. It then turns southwest for several tenths of a mile, entering Mahanoy City and reaching its confluence with Mahanoy Creek. North Mahanoy Creek joins Mahanoy Creek upstream of its mouth. =Tributaries= North Mahanoy Creek has no named tributaries. However, it does have a number of unnamed tributaries. Two of these are known unofficially as \\"Pole Run\\" and \\"Cold Run\\". Their lengths are , respectively. Hydrology North Mahanoy Creek is designated as an impaired waterbody. The causes of impairment are sedimentation/siltation and water/flow variation and the likely source of impairment is abandoned mine drainage. The creek loses most or all of its flow to underground mines. The lower reaches of the creek are ephemeral due to this flow loss. The discharge of North Mahanoy Creek at its mouth was in March 2001 and in August 2001. In March 2001, the concentration of dissolved oxygen was . The pH was 5.6 and the net alkalinity concentration was . The concentration of water hardness was . In late March 2001, the water temperature of the creek was measured to be .

In March 2001, the dissolved nitrate concentration at the mouth of North Mahanoy Creek was and the dissolved phosphorus concentration was . The concentration of dissolved sulfates was . The concentration of carbon dioxide was measured to be . Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of North Mahanoy Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is above sea level. The creek is a relatively small stream, being approximately a few feet wide in the late 1800s. North Mahanoy Creek is situated entirely within the Western Middle Anthracite Field, where coal was extensively mined between 1840 and 1950. There are relatively large silt piles in the vicinity of the creek. The landscape in the creek's vicinity is scarred by past mining operations, but there are no large abandoned mine drainage discharges in its watershed. There are still mining operations and abandoned mine lands in the watershed. The headwaters of North Mahanoy Creek are in unpolluted springs and surface runoff near Locust Mountain. However, strip mining has caused significant disruption to the watershed. A coal basin known as the North Mahanoy Basin is in the vicinity of the creek. Watershed The watershed of North Mahanoy Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Shenandoah. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Delano. The creek is one of the major tributaries of Mahanoy Creek. The designated use of North Mahanoy Creek is aquatic life. The creek's watershed is in the uppermost part of the Mahanoy Creek drainage basin. There are a number of lakes and/or ponds in the watershed of North Mahanoy Creek. History North Mahanoy Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1193047. By the late 1800s, walls high had been built on both sides of North Mahanoy Creek to keep its waters in. It was alleged during a case in the late 1800s that waste from a nearby gas works was being discharged into the creek. In the early 1900s, numerous private sewers discharged into North Mahanoy Creek. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying Park Place Road over North Mahanoy Creek was built in 1960 and is long. Another bridge of the same type, and carrying the same road was built across the creek in 1961 and is long. As of 2015, the Gilberton Coal Company has a permit for surface mine renewal, reprocessing of coal waste, and refuse disposal in in Mahanoy Township; the receiving stream is North Mahanoy Creek. Biology The drainage basin of North Mahanoy Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In 2001, no fish were observed in at the mouth of the creek. However, macroinvertebrates were observed there. Wild trout naturally reproduce in two unnamed tributaries of the creek. In 2001, a total of five macroinvertebrate taxa were observed on North Mahanoy Creek. The taxa Chironomidae and Simuliidae were classified as \\"common\\", with 10 to 24 individuals being observed. The taxa Limnephilidae and Rhyacophilidae were classified as \\"present\\", with 3 to 9 individuals being observed.

It was originally created by Rockwell in 1942 for the 1944 Brown & Bigelow Boy Scout Calendar. The model, Bob Hamilton, won a contest to be in the painting and personally delivered a print to the Vice President of the United States at the time, Henry A. Wallace.  Creation  The painting was created to encourage Scouts to participate in the war effort during World War II. The name of the painting, We, Too, Have a Job to Do, comes from a slogan that the Boy Scouts of America used in 1942 to rally scouts to support the troops by collecting metal and planting victory gardens. The model, Bob Hamilton, won a contest with his local council in Albany, New York, to be depicted in the painting. He traveled to Rockwell's studio in Arlington, Vermont, to model for Rockwell. Since Hamilton was a scout, the uniform shown in the painting was his, unlike some of Rockwell's other models. Originally, he wore a turtle shell neckerchief slide with his uniform that he had made. Rockwell did not like it and asked Hamilton to swap it for a simpler Turk's head slide. In 1944, Hamilton personally delivered a copy of the painting to Vice President Henry A. Wallace. Hamilton later became an Eagle Scout, served in the Navy, and worked for the Boy Scouts. He died in July 2008, at the age of 82.  Composition  The painting depicts a Boy Scout giving the Scout salute; behind him is an American flag, rippling in an unseen breeze. The Scout's face is solemn yet confident. His brown eyes, cleft chin, and idealized face stand out to the viewer. The Scout's uniform is perfect, with a campaign hat, showing that he is a First Class Scout. A Den Chief cord hangs over the Scout's right shoulder, and a backpack hangs over his left shoulder.  Meaning  The painting represents the idea that there is always work to be done in a Scout's neighborhood and that it is a Scout's duty to do it.

The soldiers of the division fought until early 1944 to, first, hold open some sort of lifeline to the besieged city, then to break the siege and drive off the besieging German forces. They then participated in the offensive that drove Germany's Finnish allies out of the war. Finally, the division was redeployed to take the fight to the German heartland in the winter and spring of 1945. It ended the war north of Berlin with a very creditable combat record for any rifle division.  Formation  The 310th began forming in mid July 1941 in Kazakhstan in the Akmolinsk region of the Central Asia Military District.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 77 The personnel of the division were mostly Kazakhs at this time.David M. Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 594 Its order of battle was as follows: * 1080th Rifle Regiment * 1082nd Rifle Regiment * 1084th Rifle Regiment * 860th Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 71 Col. Nikifor Matveevich Zamirovski was assigned to command on July 15, and he would hold this assignment until May 30, 1942, being promoted to Major General on January 22. The division was given about six weeks to form up before it was sent by rail all the way to the Northwestern Front, ending its journey in the Tikhvin area east of Leningrad. It was first assigned to the 52nd Army, but was reassigned to the 54th Army when that army was first formed on September 2.Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 - 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, p. 83  Battle of Leningrad  German forces cut off and isolated the city on September 8. The 310th took part in the First Sinyavino Offensive beginning on September 10; during the following 16 days of off-and-on heavy fighting the 54th Army advanced only 6 ‚Äì 10 km, and even some of these gains were later retaken by the German XXXIX Motorized Corps. The offensive was judged a failure and led to the cashiering and court-martial of Marshal G.I. Kulik, but it benefited the Soviets overall by pulling German reserves away from the Moscow axis and also delaying the transfer of the XXXXI Motorized Corps to Army Group Center.Glantz, Leningrad, p. 83 The 310th was earmarked for another offensive on Sinyavino in mid-October but this was preempted by the German offensive on Tikhvin. On October 23 the division was shifted to the 4th Army along with the 4th Guards Rifle Division. On November 8 Tikhvin fell, while another German thrust towards Volkhov was slowly forcing four rifle divisions back towards that city, driving a wedge between the 4th and 54th Armies. It was at this time that the 310th began operating alongside its \\"sister\\" 311th Rifle Division. A provisional battle group of the 8th Panzer Division tried to outflank the Soviet defenses east of Volkhov on the 8th, but a desperate counterattack by the 310th at Zelenets Station thwarted this. On the following day, the 54th Army commander, Maj. Gen. Ivan Ivanovich Fedyuninski, requested that STAVKA assign the 4th Army's Volkhov Operational Group, including both the 310th and 311th, to him, which was approved. By November 25 the main shock group of the 54th Army, the 3rd Guards, 310th and 311th Rifle Divisions, began their part of the Tikhvin counteroffensive with an attack on the 21st Infantry Division, driving it back several kilometres over the following days. The German 18th Army, vastly overextended, continued to fall back under pressure during December.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 92, 97-109 On December 17 the division was transferred once again to the 4th Army, which was shortly afterwards assigned to the Volkhov Front; it would remain in that army until February 1943.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 71 During the Lyuban Offensive Operation, the 310th played relatively minor roles. In January it was in the Kirishi area, tying down German forces in that salient. By May 1942, 4th Army was temporarily back under the Leningrad Front, and the division was earmarked for an offensive towards Chudovo in another attempt to reestablish firm communications with the 2nd Shock Army, but this was unsuccessful.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 164, 194 Novgorod Offensive General Zamirovski handed command of the division to Col. Mikhail Andreevich Orlov at the end of May 1942. In June, the 4th Army returned to the Volkhov Front, where the 310th would remain until February 1944, in the 52nd Army in the spring of 1943, then in the 59th Army for the duration of this period. In late December 1942, Colonel Orlov was replaced by Col. Nikolai Vasilevich Rogov, who would remain in command, with two brief interruptions, until the end of the war. In September 1943, the division spent a few weeks rebuilding in front reserves for the coming offensives, and was assigned to the 6th Rifle Corps on its return to the lines. In late 1943, the Leningrad, Volkhov and 2nd Baltic Fronts began planning the operations that would finally drive the besiegers away from Leningrad and, if all went well, destroy one or both of the armies of German Army Group North. The assault began on January 14, 1944. The 6th Rifle Corps was in a bridgehead west of the Volkhov river on the front's right flank. The 310th was in the Corps' first echelon along with the 239th Rifle Division, with the 65th Rifle Division in reserve, the 2nd Rifle Division of the 112th Rifle Corps in flank support, and the 16th Tank Brigade awaiting orders. In total the army fired 133,000 artillery rounds in preparation, and the ground assault went in at 1050 hours. However, 6th Corps stalled after just 1 km, in large part due to poor use of the infantry support tanks. Just to the south, however, two regiments of the 378th Rifle Division of the 14th Rifle Corps staged a premature and unauthorized attack which tore through the first two German trench lines, easing the way for 6th Corps. The following day, the corps attack was reinforced with the 16th and 29th Tank Brigades, 65th Rifle Division, and a self-propelled artillery regiment. This was sufficient to secure an advance of 7 km against heavy resistance, encircling and defeating elements of the German 28th Light Infantry Division. By late on January 16, the division had helped to tear a 20 km wide hole in main German defense belt.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 345-47, 521 The following day, despite bad weather, difficult terrain and lack of transport, the 59th Army was clearly threatening to encircle the German XXXVIII Army Corps at Novgorod. On the night of January 19 these forces got the order to break out along the last remaining route. The city was liberated on the morning of the 20th, and on the next day most of the survivors of the German corps were surrounded and soon destroyed by the 6th Rifle Corps and the 372nd Rifle Division.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 347-49 In recognition of this feat, the 310th Rifle Division was awarded the honorific title \\"Novgorod\\": As the offensive continued, the Volkhov Front was dissolved on February 13, and the division was reassigned to the Leningrad Front, first in the 67th Army and then in the 54th Army once again. In April it joined the 99th Rifle Corps in the 3rd Baltic Front until June.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 388Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 71 Svir‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive Along with the 99th Rifle Corps, the 310th was transferred in June to the 7th Army of the Karelian Front for the final offensive against Finland, which began on this sector on June 20. The division played an undistinguished role in this secondary operation, and after the Finnish surrender was reassigned to the 4th Rifle Corps, which in November went into the 32nd Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. In December the division was reassigned to the 134th Rifle Corps while still in reserve, while it was moved to Poland to become part of the 19th Army in the 2nd Belorussian Front in January 1945, ready for the assault on Germany. It remained in that corps, army and front for the duration of the war.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 71 Advance During the advance into Germany, the 19th Army mostly played a secondary role in the fighting through East Prussia and Pomerania, and by Victory Day was in the vicinity of Swinemunde.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 71 At the end of the war, the official title of the division was 310th Rifle, Novgorod, Order of Lenin, Order of the Red Banner Division.

Although Rockhampton had a railway station, it was on the southern side of the Fitzroy River and building a rail bridge across the river was seen as too expensive, so the line commenced on the north side of the river.

It was issued as a single on 30 March 2016 by Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH) and Universal Music. The English-language mid-tempo power rock ballad was composed and written by Olsa Toqi. An accompanying music video was premiered to the official YouTube channel of the Eurovision Song Contest on 13 March 2016. The song represented Albania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 in Stockholm, Sweden, after Tarifa's victory at the country's pre-selection competition Festivali i K√´ng√´s with the song's Albanian-language version \\"P√´rrall√´\\". It failed to qualify for the grand final also marking the country's sixth non- qualification in the contest. During her minimalistic performance, she was accompanied by three backing vocalists while the LED screens showed a variety of gold images.  Background and composition  In 2015, Eneda Tarifa was announced as one of the contestants selected to compete at the 54th edition of Festivali i K√´ng√´s, a competition to determine Albania's participant for the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. Following the competition's rules, the lyrics of the participating entries had to be in the Albanian language. Tarifa took part with the song \\"P√´rrall√´\\", written and composed by Olsa Toqi. For the purpose of the singer's Eurovision Song Contest participation, the latter song was remastered and translated to \\"Fairytale\\". It was recorded and reworked at Woodstock Studios in London, the United Kingdom. A reviewer of Wiwibloggs described the song as a mid-tempo power ballad, while Nicole Janke of Eurovision.de called it a rock ballad. During an interview with Wiwibloggs, Tarifa explained in regard to the revamp that she had to shorten the song and \\"wanted to make it feel more rhythmic for Eurovision\\".  Critical reception  \\"Fairytale\\" received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics and mixed to negative remarks from Wiwibloggs. Metro writer, Caroline Westbrook, elaborated, \\"If James Bond were to have an Albanian makeover and pursue bad guys through the streets of Tirana, we reckon this might just be his theme tune\\". Michael Carr from Music Feeds dubbed the singer as an \\"over the top emotive diva\\" and saying, \\"considering Dami Im is following a similar music path with her offering this year, she better watch out for Eneda Tarifa\\". Among the reviewers of Wiwibloggs, the Albanian-language version, \\"P√´rralle\\", was viewed favourably over \\"Fairytale\\". Many considered that the song should have been presented in Albanian, whilst dubbing the revamp as \\"creepy\\" and a \\"nightmare\\". In a poll conducted by Wiwibloggs titled \\"Has Eneda Tarifa turned ‚ÄúFairytale‚Äù into a nightmare?\\", the voters chose \\"P√´rralle\\" over \\"Fairytale\\" with over 1,400 votes.  Music video and promotion  Following a revamp, an accompanying music video premiered on the official YouTube channel of the Eurovision Song Contest on 13 March 2016. It begins with an ambiguous imagery of Eneda's face covered in a red pleat headdress while standing in front of an illuminated stairway. After uncloaking, the video follows with a theatrical scenery depicting a massive surreal clockwork as a background and then an outdoor scene of Eneda on a swing while sitting in seiza position. However, those three scenes are prominently intercut throughout the complete video. For promotional and supporting purposes, Tarifa made several appearances throughout Europe to specifically promote \\"Fairytale\\", including in Amsterdam's Eurovision in Concert, Eurovision Party in London and Israel Calling in Tel Aviv.

During the grand final held on 27 December 2015, Eneda Tarifa and her Albanian-language song \\"P√´rralle\\" were chosen to represent in Albania in the contest, after the votes of an expert jury panel were combined. = Stockholm = Eneda Tarifa performing during a rehearsal prior the second semi-final in Stockholm. The 61st edition of the Eurovision Song Contest took place in Stockholm, Sweden, and consisted of two semi-finals on 10 and 12 May, and the grand final on 14 May 2016.

Kibort, http://culture.pl/en/artist/bohdan-pniewski, 2015, (accessed 17 January 2015). In 1915 he failed in his first attempt to join the Faculty of Architecture at the Warsaw University of Technology, but was accepted on his second application, two years later.M. Czapelski, op.cit., p. 16. His studies were suspended due to the First World War, in which Pniewski was involved, first as a scout and then as a soldier of the Polish Military Organisation. In November 1918 he helped to peacefully disarm German soldiers, remaining in Poland after the end of the war. But Bohdan Pniewski's war did not end in 1918, because like many young Poles his age, he decided to defend his country from the newly born Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. He joined the Legions of Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and this move soon turned out to be helpful in his career, because of the position of the former soldiers in the Second Republic.Ibidem, p. 18. During the Polish-Soviet War, in 1920, he was wounded, which he proudly emphasized in the following years. During the treatment of his leg he met his future wife El≈ºbieta DƒÖbrowska (1900-1980) and was granted the Polish Cross of Valour for his bravery on the battlefield. He graduated from the Faculty of Architecture of the Warsaw University of Technology \\"with honours at the beginning of 1923, submitting as his thesis an architectural project for the Stock Exchange, supervised by Prof. Czes≈Çaw Przybylski\\".P. Kibort, http://culture.pl/en/artist/bohdan-pniewski, 2015 (accessed 17 January 2015). Architecture =Interwar Poland= Pniewski's first work was the project for the Polish pavilion at the International Exhibition of Decorative Arts and Modern Industry, built in collaboration with Stanis≈Çaw Brukalski and Lech Niemojewski in 1923.P. Kibort, http://culture.pl/en/artist/bohdan-pniewski, 2015 (accessed 17 January 2015). His first urban projects considered the redesigning of Radom, but were not carried out. Pniewski's first works were built in 1928 and as Piotr Kibort writes: \\"All of these projects have avant-garde architectural features, although Pniewski used these new forms primarily for their aesthetic values in order to achieve the effect of modernity, and not for the deliberate social programme or technology associated with them which motivated the leftist avant-garde artists of this period\\".P. Kibort, http://culture.pl/en/artist/bohdan-pniewski, 2015 (accessed 17 January 2015). His first works were the Sun settlement on Madali≈Ñskiego Street 83-95 in the Mokot√≥w district, Strzecha Urzƒôdnicza settlement on Kochowskiego and Niegolewskiego Street in the ≈ªoliborz district, and Bogus≈Çaw Herse Fashion House's exhibition pavilion for the National Exhibition in Pozna≈Ñ in 1929. Br√ºhl PalacePniewski's villa Pniewski, however, gained wide recognition in Poland not for his avant-garde settlement projects but for his designs of state buildings. In 1928 he won a competition for the design of the Polish Legation building in Sofia, which still remains the Polish embassy in Bulgaria today. In the 1930s he won a contest for designing the Temple of Divine Providence, which was never constructed due to the high projected costs and controversies over whether such a building (a church donated by the state to the Catholic Church) should be funded by the government. In 1938 one of Pniewski's best known projects was successfully finished: the redesigning of the Br√ºhl Palace - the office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. To this project Pniewski owes his pejorative, in Communist times, nickname: \\"Beck's of court architect\\" (nadworny architect Becka). The interiors of the building, redesigned by the architect in the modernist style, seemed overly expensive to the leaders of the post-war Poland. Before the Second World War Pniewski constructed his own villa on Na Skarpie Avenue, which today hosts the Polish Academy of Sciences' Museum of the Earth, \\"located in the alleged premises of the Masonic Lodge designed by Szymon Bogumi≈Ç Zug\\".P. Kibort, http://culture.pl/en/artist/bohdan-pniewski, 2015 (accessed 17 January 2015). A significant feature of the building is its library with ceramic plates with folkloric motifs on the ceiling. The villa remained Pniewski's home after the war and the architect's workplace until his death. The architect also designed, in the 1930s, Jan Kiepura's guesthouse in Krynica and Muszy≈Ñski's house on Klonowa Street. =Postwar Poland= During the Second World War Pniewski continued to teach at the Warsaw University of Technology and the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, but could not do it openly, so the venues of his lessons were kept a secret. He completed various architectural projects, but most of them remained on paper. After the war, due to the politically influenced changes at the universities, Pniewski was expelled from the Academy of Fine Arts and for a couple of years did not teach at the University of Technology.M. Czapelski, op.cit., p. 182-185. Nevertheless, he was still an influential architect and a popular one amongst the new Communist regime. Since all the projects were state funded, an architect could live only by cooperating with the government. Otherwise, a change of profession was necessary. Pniewski worked with the Communist regime, but tried to remain individually free. Polish Radio In 1948 Pniewski designed the building of the National Bank of Poland (Narodowy Bank Polski). He also took part in the rebuilding of the Polish Parliament (Sejm) and this project became his most prestigious one. He also constructed the buildings of the Polish Radio, Szosa Krakowska settlement in the Ochota District, Dom Ch≈Çopa, and the State Archives on Hankiewicz Street. One of his hardest projects was the rebuilding and redesigning of the Grand Theatre ‚Äì National Opera (Teatr Wielki ‚Äì Opera Narodowa) after the tragic causes of the Warsaw Uprising. This building became a symbol of the architect's projects constructed in the People's Republic of Poland because it was built over the course of many years and the project was revised dozens of times, which made the architect furious. Pniewski continued his teaching at the Warsaw University of Technology and after 1956 at Warsaw's Academy of Fine Arts. By his students he was called the \\"prince of architecture\\". Bohdan Pniewski died on September 5, 1965 in Warsaw ‚Äì the city to which he had dedicated his whole life and work.

The building site has been the subject of several recent redevelopment proposals, including a 2008 plan to demolish the building that was halted after a U.S. District Court ruling. After ownership of the Federal Reserve Bank Building was transferred to the General Services Administration in 2013, it was auctioned to Martin Selig Real Estate in 2015 for $16 million; the firm later announced plans to build a 48-story mixed-use skyscraper atop the existing building, but scaled back the project to only seven floors. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2013. Architecture and design The Federal Reserve Bank Building is located on a half-block on the west side of 2nd Avenue between Madison Street and Spring Street. The Modernist building consists of six stories, four above street level and two below, and is composed of structural steel and reinforced concrete. The main facade, facing 2nd Avenue, is clad partially in light gray Indiana limestone; the basement's exterior walls are clad in reddish-brown granite. A small plaza on 2nd Avenue in front of the building's main entrance, setback from the street by , features terraced planters finished with polished granite and serve as a plinth. The two basement floors of the building, located below street level, housed a vault measuring , behind reinforced concrete walls and stainless steel doors in the southeast corner; the vault used of material during its construction and once included a circular staircase that was removed in 2005. The basement floors also contained a small parking garage and secure truck lobby accessible via an alleyway, workspaces, and a shooting range for use by security personnel. The first floor features the only public spaces in the building, mainly the lobby and former teller stands, as well as the main entrance to 2nd Avenue; a small rentable space on the first floor was formerly occupied by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the 1950s and has remained unoccupied since 1990. The upper floors of the building contained open offices and check processing areas, along with employee amenities such as a cafeteria and lounges. The Federal Reserve Bank Building is one of the earliest surviving works of Seattle-based architecture firm NBBJ, founded in 1943; the lead architect of the project was William J. Bain, one of the firm's founding partners. The building was built to withstand the impact of an atomic bomb and was later retrofitted to be resistant to strong earthquakes. Designed in the Modernist style by Bain, the building recalls the pre-war Moderne style with its solid features and simple facade. The Federal Reserve Bank Building shares some features with the William Kenzo Nakamura United States Courthouse, another federal building in Seattle that was built a decade earlier. The bank building's design has been described as one of \\"permanence and security\\", with its \\"austerity and visual weight [standing out] among the many Modern skyscrapers in the surrounding financial district.\\" History The Seattle branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco was opened in 1917 and spent its first three decades in leased space at the Baillargeon Building in downtown Seattle. Plans for a permanent building for the Federal Reserve were drawn up in 1948 and approved for construction by the San Francisco board on February 28, 1949. The site at 2nd and Madison was chosen because of its proximity to the city's financial district and would replace the bank-owned Rialto Building, built in 1894 and formerly home to the Seattle Public Library as well one of the first Frederick and Nelson department stores. Designed by local architecture firm NBBJ in the post-war Modernist style, the six-story, steel-frame building would cost $2.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to construct. The cornerstone of the building was laid on April 20, 1950, marking the beginning of nine months of construction by the Kuney Johnson Company. The Federal Reserve Bank Building opened on January 2, 1951, with the Federal Reserve sharing the new building with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The building underwent some minor alterations during its 50 years of use by the Federal Reserve, consisting mostly of routine maintenance and upgrades. In 1958, the exterior was cleaned and waterproofed at the recommendation of architect William J. Bain, resulting in the discoloring of the limestone cladding. In the 1980s, the building's roof and windows were replaced under the direction of HNTB. Portions of the building were renovated in the 1990s to add new employee amenities, including a cafeteria and conference room. The 2001 Nisqually earthquake on February 28, 2001, caused minor damage to the structure that was lessened by a seismic retrofit completed in 1996. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the building was closed to public access and several security features were added to the surrounding perimeter. The Federal Reserve announced plans in 2004 to move its Seattle branch offices to the Longacres area of Renton on formerly owned by Boeing. The Seattle building was closed on February 20, 2008, with Federal Reserve vice chairman Donald Kohn noting at the Renton facility's dedication that the old building was \\"no longer adequate for efficient operations\\" and did not meet post-2001 security standards. Ownership of the building was transferred to the General Services Administration in April 2012 to prepare for a possible sale. Proposed redevelopment During development of the Seattle Monorail Project in the early 2000s, an elevated monorail station at Madison Street on 2nd Avenue was proposed in the plaza of the Federal Reserve Bank Building but was ultimately not built. =Initial plan and lawsuit over preservation= After the building was vacated in 2008, the Tukwila-based developer Sabey Corporation negotiated a deal with the Federal Reserve Bank to purchase the property for $19.75 million. The sale was opposed by local preservationists, who formed the \\"Committee for the Preservation of the Seattle Federal Reserve Bank Building\\" and filed a suit against the Federal Reserve Bank in U.S. District Court on November 21, 2008 to halt the proposed sale. Federal judge Robert S. Lasnik ruled in favor of the preservationists group on March 19, 2010, finding that the Federal Reserve Bank had not followed proper federal disposal procedures for surplus property. On February 4, 2013, the Federal Reserve Bank Building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank sought to designate the building as a Seattle city landmark, but were unable to gain approval from the City of Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board. A second attempt at the city landmark nomination, led by Martin Selig Real Estate, began in 2016. =Auction and skyscraper proposal= A rendering of Selig's original proposal for a 48-story skyscraper atop the existing Federal Reserve Bank Building, since scaled back. The General Services Administration (GSA) attempted to dispose of the Federal Reserve Bank Building through its surplus federal property procedures, but by November 2014 received no compelling applications from government agencies and organizations with a public function. A public auction began on December 5, 2014, with a starting bid set at $5 million, and was initially set to end on January 28, 2015; in late January, bids rose to near $10 million between the eight bidders and forced the auction's deadline to be extended into the following month. Bidding closed on February 7, 2015, with a high bid of $16 million submitted by an undisclosed bidder. In April 2015, it was announced that the winning bidder of the auction was Martin Selig Real Estate. The firm announced plans to build a 31-story office tower, designed by Perkins and Will, and incorporating the existing building as the skyscraper's podium with a 3-story winter garden separating the historic building from the addition. One of the unsuccessful bids came from Seattle Public Schools, who had proposed renovating the building into an elementary school in 2014, the first downtown school in 65 years. Initially, the district applied to the GSA in July 2014 through the United States Department of Education to acquire the property, but were rejected by the latter over the tentative nature of the application; the school board later voted in November 2014 against submitting a second application over the $50 million cost and 3-year deadline for renovations. The district was, however, allowed to participate in the January 2015 auction and submitted an opening bid of $1 million; Seattle Public Schools was the first bidder to drop out of the auction when the price passed the district's final bid of $5.8 million. The Compass Housing Authority, a homeless advocacy group, also proposed renovating the building into a downtown homeless shelter and services center in 2014, but were rejected by the United States Department of Health and Human Services over a lack of funding. In December 2015, Selig announced updated plans to include 12 additional stories of housing, bringing the total height of the skyscraper to and 48 stories, which would make it the fifth-tallest building in the city. The skyscraper is scheduled to begin construction in 2018 and open in 2020. After the April 2015 purchase, Selig paid for the cleaning of the building's exterior and plaza and some interior demolition of the first and fourth floors. After the acquisition of Fernando Botero's \\"Adam and Eve\\", a pair of Rubenesque statues, by Martin Selig in early 2016, it was announced that the \\"Adam\\" would be displayed on a pedestal in front of the Federal Reserve Bank Building. In June 2016, Selig announced that he would scale back plans after facing opposition from historic preservation groups over the alterations to the historic structure. The new proposed eight-story addition would have of office space and include a two-story penthouse; parts of the new structure would be illuminated at night. The addition is being designed by a team with William Bain Jr. and John Bain, the son and grandson, respectively, of original architect William Bain. A third design released in late November lowered the height to seven stories and add an opaque west facade after complaints from a neighboring condominium tower. Selig plans to begin construction in late 2018 and complete the addition in 2020.

Reid was born in Tain in Ross-shire, Scotland in 1757, the second son of John Reid (1725 ‚Äì 1779) a Bailie of Tain, and his wife Mary Ross (1725 ‚Äì 1808).  Early career  By 1779 he was in Canton acting as the Austrian Emperor's Consul and was in partnership with a man named Bourgoyne of the French Hong. He was also the agent for Willem Bolts's Trieste Company. In January 1781 John Henry Cox, son of the well known London clockmaker James Cox who had become bankrupt in Canton in 1774, arrived in Macau to try to retrieve some of his father's bad debts and to sell off his remaining stock. He and Jack Reid went into partnership under the name Cox and Reid. The firm acted as agents for India- based shippers who were bringing in raw cotton, cotton piece goods and opium. The partners bought two small ships of their own (the ‚ÄòSupply‚Äô and the ‚ÄòEnterprise) to trade on their own account. In 1783 the firm was joined by Daniel Beale.  Partnership with Cox and Beale  In 1785: ‚ÄúSensing a good thing, the firm of Cox and Reid bought a small brig of 60 tons, (called the ‚ÄòHarmon‚Äô but renamed the ‚ÄòSea Otter‚Äô) under the command of Captain James Hanna, and despatched the little vessel with a small cargo of woollens, blankets, iron bars, knives, nails, etc. and a supply of ornaments and baubles to the north-west coast of America, to barter with the ‚ÄòRed Indians‚Äô in Canada for furs. The area was supposed to be a preserve of the South Sea Company, of London, but this did not seem to worry Cox and his friends in the least. Five hundred and sixty sea-otter skins were obtained and landed and sold at Canton for over ¬£5,000‚Äù. (or 20,600 Spanish dollars) In 1786, trading under the fictitious name of the 'Austrian East India Company‚Äô (a name supposedly pinched from the earlier legitimate company which had gone bankrupt in 1785), the partners bought in London a 400-ton ship called the Loudoun, fitted her out there and renamed her ‚ÄòImperial Eagle‚Äô. With false papers (to avoid paying license fees to the East India Company) and flying the Austrian flag she sailed on 24 November from Ostend under Captain Charles William Barkley for Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island via Cape Horn. After various adventures she returned to China towards the end of 1787 with 800 furs which were sold in Macao for 30,000 Spanish silver dollars. By this time however Jack Reid had gone bankrupt. ‚ÄúNot content with the truly splendid profits made by the firm of which he was a partner, he had been engaging in some speculations on his own account in Canton, probably selling on extended terms to Chinese merchants goods obtained on credit from his constituents in India or lending money borrowed in India to Chinese merchants in Canton for the sake of the higher rate of interest promised by the Chinese. He overestimated the probity of his Chinese clients and when these debtors absconded he sustained such heavy losses that he had to declare himself insolvent. The Imperial Austrian Company closed its doors and John Reid left China, a victim of his own gullibility and covetousness.‚Äù  Later life  Reid left Canton in February 1787 on the East India Company ship Ganges. (782 tons) The firm of Cox and Beale, with the later addition of Jack Reid's younger brother David (1761 -1845) who left Canton in 1801, eventually became Jardine Matheson. On Jack Reid's return to London he joined his older brother Andrew (1751 ‚Äì 1841) as a distiller and wine and spirit merchant. When Andrew Reid invested in and became a partner in Meux's Brewery in 1793, Jack also became a partner. In 1795 Jack married Ann Holland (1768 ‚Äì 1848), the daughter of a clergyman. Meux's Brewery became Meux Reid, and after an acrimonious split with the Meux family in 1808, in 1816 became Reid's Brewery. Jack lived at 48 Bedford Square, London, next door to his brother Andrew at no 46, and also owned Kingswood Lodge in Egham, Surrey. At his death on 11/4/1821 he was still the owner of 5 ¬£10,000 shares in Reid's Brewery.

Note subsidence craters at center, apparently from the attempts to plug the leaking well. The Aliso Canyon gas leak (also called Porter Ranch gas leak and Porter Ranch gas blowoutMatt Ferner, Lydia O‚ÄôConnor (8 January 2016) Here‚Äôs What It‚Äôs Like To Live Next To California‚Äôs Gas Blowout Catastrophe) was a massive natural gas leak in the Santa Susana Mountains near Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, California. Discovered by SoCalGas employees on October 23, 2015,Sharon McNary (10 February 2016) Sorting out Porter Ranch facts vs. rumors gas was escaping from a well within the Aliso Canyon underground storage facility. This second- largest gas storage facility of its kind in the United States belongs to the Southern California Gas Company, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy. On January 6, 2016, Governor Jerry Brown issued a state of emergency. The Aliso gas leak's carbon footprint is said to be larger than the Deepwater Horizon leak in the Gulf of Mexico. On February 11, 2016, the gas company reported that it had the leak under control. On February 18, 2016, state officials announced that the leak was permanently plugged. An estimated (0.097 Mt) of methane and of ethane were released into the atmosphere,Conley et al., Methane emissions from the 2015 Aliso Canyon blowout in Los Angeles, CA. In: Science (2016), . The initial effect of the release increased the estimated 5.3 Gt of methane in the Earth's atmosphere by about 0.002%, diminishing to half that in 6‚Äì8 years. It was widely reported to have been the worst single natural gas leak in U.S. history in terms of its environmental impact. By comparison, the entire rest of the South Coast Air Basin combined, with a population of about 18 million people, emits approximately 413,000 tonnes of methane and 23,000 tonnes of ethane annually. Facility After oil was discovered at Aliso Canyon in 1938, J. Paul Getty's Tidewater Associated Oil Company produced oil and gas until the Sesnon-Frew reservoir, the largest reservoir within the oil field, was depleted in the early 1970s. On December 18, 1968, a blowout and fire, destroying equipment but causing no injuries, occurred at one of the wells when an operator attempted to remove two gas-lift valves. Getty sold his portion of the field to Pacific Lighting Company, a gas company, which repurposed it to gas storage in 1972. As opposed to current practice, older wells were not sealed to the surrounding rock formation, including their often more than one mile of steel casing. Today, \\"cement from the surface of the ground to the bottom of the well [...] makes the casings stronger and protects them from water.\\" The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility contains 115 wells tapping a reservoir that \\"hold[s] up to 86 billion cubic feet of natural gas for distribution to residences, businesses, and electric utilities in the L.A. basin\\". The field is the second largest storage facility of its kind in the United States.

Local residents believed the gas blowout started before SoCalGas admitted to discovering it, and many residents reported having unexplained illnesses a week or so earlier. According to KPCC's website, some residents posted complaints of earlier symptoms on a Porter Ranch gas leak Facebook page. This event has been called a blowout in several news reports. For instance, a February 2016 article in The Orange County Register called \\"Gas facility that had blowout over Porter Ranch will have to play by new rules.\\" stated \\"in the case of the blown-out well, the casing is believed to have failed under high pressure, allowing the gas to escape.\\" According to OSHA's website a blowout is \\"an uncontrolled flow of gas, oil, or other well fluids\\" from a well.\\" An article in The Huffington Post entitled \\"Here‚Äôs How Enormous The Methane Blowout Is In California\\" stated that as of February 1, 2016, the SS-25 well released an estimated 91,000 metric tons of methane gas.\\"The article said that \\"while this gas blowout has prompted comparisons to BP‚Äôs oil well failure in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in 1989, experts say this leak will have further-reaching environmental consequences.\\" Causes The source of the leak was a metal pipe in a breached casing of injection well \\"Standard Sesnon 25\\" (SS 25) that lies deep. SoCal Gas had hypothesized that the leak was no more than down in the column used to move gas in and out of the well. Well SS 25 was drilled in 1953 and initially had safety valves, which were removed in 1979 because the valves were old and leaking. Because the well was not considered \\"critical, that is, one within 100 feet of a road or a park, or within 300 feet of a home\\", the valves were merely removed and not replaced. Multiple safety valves had been removed from the Aliso Canyon/Porter Ranch 1950s-era pipes in 1979, and were never replaced, a fact that was also confirmed by a special investigation into the leak by Congressman Brad Sherman's office.

NPR All Things Considered, January 21, 2016, retrieved January 22, 2016 On December 7, 2015, an anonymous video was published that showed a cloud of methane gas hovering over the community of Porter Ranch. The image was captured with an infrared camera, showing the extent of the plume. On May 17, 2019, the California Public Utilities Commission announced that Blade Energy Partners had completed their root cause analysis of the gas leak that occurred on October 23, 2015. The principal findings from the root cause analysis include: * The leak's direct cause was a rupture of the outer 7-inch well casing due to microbial corrosion from the outside resulting from contact with groundwater. * SoCalGas did not conduct detailed follow-up inspections or analyses after previous leaks. Blade identified more than 60 casing leaks at Aliso Canyon before the October 2015 incident going back to the 1970s, but no failure investigations were conducted by SoCalGas. * SoCalGas lacked any form of risk assessment focused on well integrity management and lacked systematic practices of external corrosion protection and a real-time, continuous pressure monitoring system for well surveillance. * Updated well safety practices and regulations adopted by DOGGR address most of the root causes of the leak identified during Blade's investigation. On the same day, the California Public Utilities Commission also published a video on describing the details of the leak. In response to the report from Blade Energy, SoCalGas issued a response stating \\"Blade's report confirms SoCalGas complied with gas storage regulations in existence at the time of the leak. Blade also determined that SoCalGas' current practices and new state regulations address most, if not all, of the causes identified in the report.\\" Emissions Natural gas consists largely of methane, an invisible and odorless greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 86 times greater than carbon dioxide in a 20-year time frame, tailing off to about 29 times the effect of carbon dioxide in a 100-year time frame on a mass per mass basis.Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Technical report, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA., 2013 The leak initially released about 44,000 kilograms(kg) of methane per hour or 1,200 tons of methane every day, which in terms of greenhouse gas output per month compares with the equivalent effluvia from 200,000 cars in a year. On January 14, 2016, Time magazine compared the 1.6 million lbs of methane released each day to the emissions of 6 coal fired powerplants, 2.2 million cows per day, or 4.5 million cars.Justin Worland, Heather Jones. This Is How Much the California Gas Leak Is Hurting the Planet Time magazine, January 14, 2016, retrieved January 17, 2016. As of January 2016, the latest methane measurement per the California Air Resources Board (Carb) was from December 22, 2015 and had decreased from a peak of 58,000¬±12,000 kg/h to 30,300 kg/h, the equivalent of \\"more than 1,411,851 cars\\" by a different calculation using EPA estimates.Paul Blake How many cars and burping cows equal the California gas leak?, BBC News, Washington, January 11, 2016 The Aliso gas leak carbon footprint is referred to as \\"larger than the Deepwater Horizon leak in the Gulf of Mexico\\".California‚Äôs Methane Gas Leak Environmental Catastrophe Explained Antidote, interview with Timothy O‚ÄôConnor, TheLipTV2, 36 min, January 6, 2016, retrieved January 11, 2016 This single event had a 100-year global warming potential of about 1.5% of the entire annual SoCAB methane and carbon dioxide emissions. Steve Conley, an atmospheric scientist at UC Davis and owner of Scientific Aviation, independently measured the gas emissions. He sampled the air by flying over the site in his single-engine airplane equipped with an analyzer, which is one of only 3 or 4 of such planes in the country. He said the Aliso Canyon flights were \\"the hardest [...] I've ever done\\" because of the headache-inducing smell and sickening turbulence. He doubted the readings initially, and \\"thought [the instruments] had stopped working because I'd never seen measurement that large before.\\" He had coincidentally been contracted by the California Energy Commission prior to the gas leak, and said that if he had not been contracted and ready to go, \\"no one would have known how big [the leak] was.\\" Methane emissions from the Aliso Canyon gas leak were detected by the TCCON site at Caltech within a day of the start of the leak, but researchers at Caltech did not have an explanation for what was causing something \\"really weird\\" over Pasadena until later. TCCON's monitoring data were used in analyses of the leak to estimate ethane emissions of 7,700 ¬± 1,700 tonnes using Steve Conley's methane estimate of 97,100 tonnes. Besides methane, the gas leak contained tert-butyl mercaptan, tetrahydrothiophene,Aliso Canyon Underground Storage Field in Los Angeles County Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), January 15, 2016, retrieved January 17, 2016 and methyl mercaptan, which gives the gas a rotten-egg smell. These odorants have been used for decades and were considered harmless although they can cause nausea and vomiting. In addition, the gas contains some carcinogenic benzene.Peak Benzene Air Levels in the Porter Ranch Community oehha.ca.gov, January 5, 2016, retrieved January 11, 2016. The pollutants may have long-term consequences far beyond the region. =Effect on local community= Local residents have reported headaches, nausea, skin rashes, and severe nosebleeds. About 50 children per day saw school nurses for severe nosebleeds. There have been more than usual eye, ear and throat infections. By December 25, 2015, more than 2,200 families from the Porter Ranch neighborhood had been temporarily relocated, and more than 2,500 households were still being processed. As of January 7, 2016, 2,824 households or about 11,296 people had been temporarily relocated by SoCal Gas, while more than 6,500 families have filed for help. Two schools were relocated in January. The community of Eight Mile, Alabama had a spill of the natural gas odorant within their community in 2008. Residents continue to experience these symptoms under their long term exposure to mercaptan. The residents say they got very little of the assistance provided to Porter Ranch residents. Methyl mercaptan is toxic if inhaled according to its MSDS sheet. However, it is considered fairly harmless by government and industry officials. Whether it is the source of the illnesses in Porter Ranch and Eight Mile has been a subject of debate. Closure of well By the end of November 2015 SoCal Gas had attempted six well kill procedures to stop the gas flow by pumping a mixture of mud and brine down the well, the last being on November 25. The attempts failed because of ice formation and a high upward pressure averaging .Associated Press Huge California gas leak could take months to fix CBS News, January 2, 2016, retrieved January 11, 2016 On December 4, 2015 SoCal Gas started drilling a relief well to the caprock, down, with the help of Boots & Coots, a subsidiary of Halliburton. The relief well is \\"similar to the relief well BP‚Äôs engineers drilled to stop oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 after the Deepwater Horizon disaster\\". The plan was to pump liquid and cement into the main well once the relief well could vent the gas safely. SoCal Gas estimated the first relief well would be completed by February 24, 2016. SoCal Gas planned to drill a secondary relief well, estimating the leak repair to take up until the end of March 2016. After the seventh effort to plug the leak with slurry starting December 22 had created a 25-feet-deep crater around the wellhead, the danger of a blow out increased. The well needed to be stabilized with tension cables and further attempts to plug the well from above were halted. State regulators became more concerned about the wellhead's stability. In January SoCal Gas sought permission to capture the natural gas and possibly incinerate it, but state regulators voted against it, worried about safety.Sharon McNary Porter Ranch Gas Leak to Be Stopped Ahead of Schedule, Utility Says KQED, January 20, 2016, accessdate January 22, 2016 On February 11, 2016, the relief well intercepted the base of the leaking well and the company began pumping heavy fluids to control the flow of gas out of the leaking well. On February 18, 2016, state officials announced that the leak was permanently plugged. Criticism Steve Conley, the atmospheric scientist that has been measuring the leak's gas emissions, has stated that there was no rapid response plan for this kind of event: \\"We do not have anything in place to measure giant leaks like this, or to watch them to solve issues.\\" He suggested that contracts needed to be ready so that, \\"as soon as a leak is spotted you are given a go order and two hours later you're measuring a leak.\\" On January 11, 2016 Mitchell Englander, the Los Angeles City Councilman representing Porter Ranch, criticized SoCal Gas \\"operating a facility of this magnitude, [...] feeding 20 million addresses\\" for not having a backup plan, the delay in bringing necessary equipment on site \\"from the Gulf states like they did in this particular situation\\" and the delay in catching the brine, oil and chemical mist \\"landing on people's homes and turning their cars black\\". The Center for Biological Diversity has criticized Governor Brown's slow response \\"because state regulators' hands-off approach to underground injection helped set the stage for this catastrophe.\\" The Center also said, \\"The state has known for years that aging natural gas infrastructure was a disaster waiting to happen, but officials mostly ignored those risks.\\"David Siders Jerry Brown declares emergency around Southern California gas leak The Sacramento Bee, January 6, 2016, retrieved January 11, 2016. Experts in petroleum engineering criticized the delay for not drilling a relief well until six weeks after the leak was known, and for drilling only one relief well instead of two. In January 2016 the Associated Press reported that SoCal Gas had been under-reporting the levels of benzene in the air surrounding the well. Regulatory reactions Within two days of discovery, \\"a dozen or more local and state agencies were involved\\". The California Air Resources Board measured methane on the ground near the well, from towers, satellites and airplanes, communicating results to the California Energy Commission and SoCal Gas. The Board asked SoCal Gas 18 very detailed questions about the natural gas, basic leakage rate and leak dynamics. The Federal Aviation Administration established a temporary flight restriction over the leak site until March 2016. On December 7, 2015 Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer sued SoCal Gas over its handling of the massive well failure. On December 15, 2015, the County of Los Angeles declared a state of emergency. Feuer's Office went to Court again on December 23, 2015 and secured a judicially enforceable agreement with SoCal Gas for the company to speed up relocation efforts of residents affected by the massive leak. Local residents called upon Governor Jerry Brown to intercede. Kathleen Brown, his sister, is on the board of Sempra Energy, which owns Southern California Gas. The Governor visited the site and the neighborhood on January 4, 2016,Alison Canyon Natural Gas Leak - The California Governor‚Äôs Office of Emergency Services (CalOES), State of California and declared a state of emergency on January 6, 2016. He issued stepped-up inspections and safety measures for all natural gas storage facilities in California; further injections at Aliso Canyon had already been prohibited. Local health officials indicated that long-term exposure to certain trace chemicals could lead to health problems. In January 2016 two California senators asked the heads of the US Department of Justice and US Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency for a \\"legal analysis of any federal authorities that could apply to this incident and storage fields in general\\" and a \\"technical analysis of whether Southern California Gas Company could more quickly reduce the gas stored in the facility.\\" On January 11, four California State senators introduced bills to enact an immediate moratorium on any new injections of natural gas and the use of vintage wells (SB 875), to ensure that SoCal Gas will pay housing, relocation and emergency response costs and prohibit the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) from allocating those costs to ratepayers, and that it will pay the costs to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions from its utility profits (SB 876). SB 887 would require all 14 underground natural gas storage facilities to be inspected within the next 12 months and at least annually thereafter; it would also require enhanced safety standards such as the installation of subsurface safety valves, using new leak-detection technology and development of rigorous response plans.Fran Pavley. Senate legislation would bar new gas injections at Aliso Canyon, add more stringent gas well regulations statewide. California State Senate Majority Caucus, January 11, 2016,access date January 20, 2016 The unavailability of the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility has caused insufficient delivery of gas to power plants, leading to a strained electricity grid. The CPUC has ordered Southern California Edison to install a 20 MW (80 MWh) lithium ion battery storage capacity at the utility's Mira Loma substation near San Bernardino, California to mitigate power failures during winter. Political reaction On March 31, 2016 The New York Times published a magazine feature article about the leak called \\"The Invisible Catastrophe,\\" noting that in an election year a \\"menacing disaster that causes mass vomiting and mass nosebleeds in a wealthy, vote-rich community ...is a candidate‚Äôs dream.\\" While crediting Governor Jerry Brown as the \\"only politician who has failed to use the gas leak for political gain,\\" it noted freshman Congressman Steve Knight's acceptance of campaign contributions from SoCalGas' parent company Sempra Energy, and his continued defense of the company into December when he said they were \\"working on this as diligently as they can.\\" While Knight later called for congressional hearings on the matter, one of his opponents, Democrat Bryan Caforio, quickly seized on the environmental disaster as a central issue of the 25th Congressional race, which according to the Times article \\"promises to be one of few closely contested races in the House.\\" The Invisible Catastrophe The New York Times Magazine, March 31, 2016 Los Angeles Times wrote that no politician is \\"pursuing the issue as hard as Caforio,\\" who on January 6, 2016, spoke to a group of disgruntled Porter Ranch residents who attended a meeting co-hosted by environmental activist Erin Brockovich.

Records show the utility has been negotiating this step with regulators for several weeks. Since the multiple investigations into the cause of the leak have not been completed, Congressman Brad Sherman insisted that the process of reopening the storage facility must proceed with extreme caution. Aliso Canyon is not deemed ready to resume normal operations by regulators or chief politicians that are involved with the oversight of the securing and cleanup of the leak. Congressman Brad Sherman urged that the gas company be restricted to minimal operations required to prevent power interruptions. The storage field is a primary supplier to gas-powered electric plants. The gas leak has been cited by experts and independent researchers as the largest in U.S. history.Article in Los Angeles Times 1 November 2016 accessed 31 January 2017Article in EcoWatch.com 27 February 2016 accessed 31 January 2017 Legal consequences On November 23, 2015, some residents who had been displaced by the leaking gases filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court to require that SoCal Gas to disclose information related to the health risks of the gases released. The plaintiffs also had continued to seek damages. In January, it was thought that residents might have filed as many as 1,000 lawsuits. On February 2, 2016, Los Angeles County filed criminal charges against SoCalGas for its failure to report the leak immediately. The charges include three counts of failing to immediately report the leak following its detection on October 23, 2015, and one count of \\"discharging air contaminants\\" beginning the same day. On September 13, 2016, The Los Angeles Times reported that SoCalGas reached a plea agreement with the Los Angeles County prosecutor's office. Under the agreement, SoCalGas plead no contest to one misdemeanor count of failing to immediately report the October 2015 leak and was ordered to pay a $4 million fine. The resulting settlement between the local Los Angeles prosecutor's office and SoCalGas executives had ended in a mere misdemeanor charge, the lowest possible charge, which can be expunged. In addition to the negotiated plea deal, SoCalGas had paid a penalty fine of a relatively small $4 million U.S. dollars. US$4 million is the equivalent of the amount of revenue that SoCalGas received in profits in less than most average 12 hour time periods during the fiscal year of 2015. The Porter Ranch Gas Leak has been cited often by experts and independent tests as the largest gas leak in U.S. History. In 2018 SoCalGas agreed to payments of $119.5 million to several government entities over the incident.

It is a low, dense, spreading shrub with small, fleshy leaves and mauve to purple flowers. Description Eremophila chamaephila is a low, spreading, densely foliaged shrub usually growing to high and wide. The leaves are arranged alternately along lumpy branches and are themselves lumpy on the lower side. They are mostly long and about wide and are dark green often purplish towards their end. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils and lack a stalk. There are 5 linear to lance-shaped green or purplish sepals which are long and have a lumpy surface. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is purple on its outside surface and white, spotted purple inside. The outer surface is glabrous but the inside is hairy with the hairiness continuing onto the lower petal lobe and the 4 stamens extend slightly beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs between October and December and is followed by fruits which are almost spherical, about in diameter and are slightly fleshy, wrinkled when dry and have a thin, hard, glabrous covering. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Ludwig Diels in 1905 and the description was published in Botanische Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie. The specific epithet chamaephila is said to be derived from the ancient Greek chamae meaning \\"lowly\\" or \\"creeping\\" and philus meaning \\"loving\\" referring to the low growing habit of this species. In ancient Greek, chamai (œáŒ±ŒºŒ±ŒØ) expresses \\"on the ground\\",Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie.Oxford: Clarendon Press. while \\"loving\\" is philos (œÜŒØŒªŒøœÇ) in ancient Greek. Distribution and habitat Eremophila chamaephila occurs north of Esperance in the area between Ravensthorpe and Grass Patch in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in sand or clay, often in disturbed sites like roadsides. Conservation status Eremophila chamaephila is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat. Use in horticulture Earth-loving poverty bush is an ideal small, compact shrub for a very low hedge, along the edge of a footpath or as an understorey container plant. It can be grown from cuttings, taking several months to form roots in warmer weather or can be grafted onto Myoporum species. It prefers well- drained soil but is drought tolerant and frost hardy.

It was built from to . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000.  History  Leeke Homestead, constructed c.1922-24 is a basic, timber and corrugated iron residence located on Great Keppel Island, near Yeppoon. The house was the home of Lizzie Leeke (formerly O'Neill) who lived on the island from 1922 until 1945. She originally moved to Great Keppel from Gladstone with her husband Michael O'Neill and they depastured sheep on the island from 1918 when they purchased the pastoral lease on the island. The O'Neills were by no means pioneers of the island, Great Keppel had been occupied by Europeans for over fifty years by the time they took up the lease. In these fifty years, dramatic and tragic events had already occurred in order to enable white occupation of the islands. Captain James Cook sailed into Keppel Bay in 1770 and named the bay and islands after his superior in England, Rear Admiral Augustus Keppel. There were subsequent visits by other exploratory parties, however, white exploitation of Great Keppel Island began in earnest in 1866. Prominent Central Queensland squatter, Robert Ross, obtained leases over both Great Keppel and North Keppel Islands \\"from year to year and not exceeding five years\\" in partnership with C.E Beddome and Sir Arthur Palmer (MLA for Port Curtis, 1866‚Äì78 and Minister for Lands 1866-69). Over the next year, Ross began to \\"prepare\\" the island as a cattle property by driving 84 indigenous people into a cave and murdering them. In 1882, Ross acquired secure tenure for Great Keppel Island through land dummying, and depastured 4000 sheep on the island. W. T Wyndham became stockkeeper for Ross and declared himself the first European to live permanently on the island. Despite his association with Ross, who was justifiably feared by the Aborigines, Wyndham was able to establish a good relationship with the Keppel Islanders. He had previously worked for Dr Walter Roth, the Northern Protector of Aborigines and had lived previously with Aboriginal people in New South Wales. Wyndham was a remarkable man who went on to make his home at Boyne Island, near Gladstone. He spoke a number of Aboriginal languages and recorded much valuable anthropological data in his diaries. On the island, Mount Wyndham and Wyndham Cove are named for him, his grave on Boyne Island, near Gladstone, is entered in the Queensland Heritage Register. In September 1883, Ross came across to Great Keppel and kidnapped seven men and twenty three women and children by luring them onto a boat with the promise of food. Wyndham resigned and told the story to the \\"Queensland Figaro\\" which ran the story titled, \\"Kidnapping Keppel Island Blacks.\\" A public battle of claims and counter-claims followed. Years later, Dr W Roth, using Wyndham's diaries and his own observations, stated that \\"human lives were sacrificed for sheep.\\" Ross died in 1893 and his family nearly lost control of the islands until his brother Colin re-acquired the lease. James Lucas came to the island with his family and took up as stockkeeper, soon acquiring a reputation for cruelty and maltreatment of the remaining Keppel Islanders. By this time, the run had a two-roomed weatherboard house, a small shearing shed and several small fenced sheepyards. This house is not the Leeke Homestead and was located closer to the creek. The shearing shed, however, was subsequently used by Lizzie. By 1902, Archibald Meston, the Southern Protector of Aborigines had removed the remaining Keppel Islanders to government reserves, including the one at Fraser Island. Lucas, who had acquired the leases from the Ross family, forfeited them in 1903. For many years after the removal of the Aborigines, the Keppel Islands attracted little interest. They were used mainly by boating parties and although several leases were issued, no stock was depastured and nor did anyone live on the island before the 1920s. The grazing lease for Great Keppel, covering almost the entire island was transferred to Michael O'Neill in 1918. O'Neill, who had several farm properties near Gladstone, unsuccessfully sought a more secure tenure than occupation licence through the support of George Carter, MLA for Port Curtis. O'Neill had depastured 1500 merino sheep upon taking up the lease and he and Lizzie moved to the island to live permanently in 1922; however, O'Neill died soon after in early 1923. Lizzie stayed on and \\"remained as a resolute and colourful character on the island for twenty-three years.\\" In October 1924, she married Ralph Leeke, a young fisherman from Keppel Sands. Lizzie continued to run sheep on the island and Ralph worked as a fisherman - they were considered an eccentric couple, not least because Lizzie was about 17 years older than Ralph. There is uncertainty about whether it was Leeke or O'Neill who built the homestead. Accounts from the Leeke family claim that Ralph took a barge to his home in Keppel Sands, dismantled the house and shipped it back to the island. He landed at the shearing shed and carried the material up the hill and re-built the house. The shearing shed remained from previous lease-holders, however, a new site was chosen for the homestead. Other accounts claim that O' Neill built the homestead before he died. Bill Leeke, Ralph's nephew, spent many holidays on the island in the 1920s and 30s. He remembered the homestead thus: > I slept on the verandah of the Homestead on a stretcher bed. The bed had a > spread made of possum skins lined with a cloth material. It crackled a bit > when you sat on it. Possums were declared a pest and the Government paid a > shilling a skin. The floor of the house was littered with possum skin rugs. > The windows in the front of the house looking onto the verandah had curtains > and the doorways had hanging screens made from reeds that grew in the salt > pan and along the creek. There was a small parlour with lace cloths on > occasional tables with pieces of coral and rare shells. The kitchen was at > the back of the house and that is where we ate. Although the house was built > of corrugated iron it had a woman's touch and always seemed cool and homely > to me. In 1933 Ralph left Lizzie and the island and Lizzie was left by herself to run the stock. The mid 1930s saw the beginning of a greater public use of the island, Fisherman's Beach was regularly being used by people as a camping area for various lengths of time. With the increase in the number of visitors to the island, stories of Lizzie and her life on the island became more common. Comments were often made of the physical and mental toughness of the woman to be able to not only survive on the island, but to also run the sheep successfully. Apart from shearing time when a shearer and wool classer would come to the island, the only help she had was from her two dogs. Lizzie sold the lease in 1945 and died on the mainland a few years later. The lease passed through several hands and it appears that the homestead was never lived in permanently again as consequent lease holders built other houses on the island. In 1971, the grazing lease and the homestead were sold to the resort management at the time. The resort management retain tenure of the property. The shearing shed has been re-built and the homestead has been repaired and partly furnished and interpreted as Lizzie's home. Visits to the homestead are offered as an activity for guests at the resort.  Description  Leeke Homestead is located on Great Keppel Island, east of Yeppoon. The Homestead is on the northern side of the island on a hillside overlooking tidal mangrove plains and Leeke's Beach beyond. The homestead is accessible by 4wd vehicle or walking. A simple timberlog fence defines the boundary around the homestead paddock. The house is sheltered by large spreading fig trees with several large, weatherbeaten Hoop Pines and Date Palms scattered throughout the yard. A number of recent, ancillary buildings are also located within this paddock. The homestead is a simple square plan building with a pyramidal roof form without eaves. it is elevated on short timber stumps. Both the walls and roof are clad with corrugated iron, with some sections of weatherboards including those lining a small verandah on the north- west side of the house. This verandah has cross-braced balustrades, effectively the only external \\"decoration\\" on the house. Internally, the house has six rooms. Floors throughout are wide boards of rough-sawn timber and walls and ceilings are lined with painted plywood with coverstrips. The former kitchen is located on the eastern side of the building with a large stove recess that used to accommodate a wood stove. The recess is clad externally with corrugated iron and has a galvanised steel flue. A recent kitchen and bathroom has been fitted in a small room in the north-east corner off the kitchen, that was previously a small bedroom (where Bill Leeke used to sleep as a boy). The largest interior space is the living room which is now furnished with a few pieces of period furniture and has framed family pictures on the walls. A small store room is located on the southern side of the living space, adjacent to the large bedroom. The largest bedroom is L-shaped in plan and has vinyl floor sheeting. The only internal doors are to the store room and bedroom. Windows throughout the house are double-hung, unpainted timber sashes. The woolshed is constructed on the tidal plain. It has been recently re-built and has a concrete slab floor, structural timber frame and galvanised steel cladding.  Heritage listing  Leeke Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Leeke Homestead is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history, being a representation of the development of Great Keppel Island. The Homestead is a part of the story of attempts to establish viable pastoral operations on the island through the violent displacement of the indigenous population. The Homestead is the only remaining physical link between the 4000 years of Woppaburra occupation and the tourist development that now dominates the island. Leeke Homestead illustrates the tenacity and determination of Lizzie Leeke in staying on the island for so long, tolerating isolation and flouting social convention in order to live the independent life of her choosing. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Leeke Homestead demonstrates the principal characteristics of an isolated island residence. Built by the owner, at a time when the transport of materials was difficult and skilled labour was unavailable, Leeke Homestead is distinctive as an example of the kinds of dwellings erected under such circumstances in remote locations along the Queensland coast. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Leeke Homestead is of aesthetic significance, due to its setting among Hoop Pines and fig trees on a high point of the island. The simple design and rudimentary construction techniques contribute to its aesthetic qualities and assist in the integration of the house in the landscape.

The convention effectively turned Serbia into a vassal state of Austria-Hungary and meant her accession by proxy to the subsequent Triple Alliance (1882). The Balkans had been divided into spheres of influence, where Austria took the western part (including Serbia) and Russia took the eastern part (including Bulgaria). The treaty came after the railway convention of 6 April 1881 for the construction of the Belgrade‚ÄìNi≈° section of the Vienna‚ÄìConstantinople railway, and the trade treaty of 6 May 1881 which made Austria-Hungary virtually the sole market for agricultural products from Serbia and thereby dominant. Following the Treaty of Berlin (1878), Serbia chose to accept Austria as its patron, when Russia had become a protector of Bulgaria. Nevertheless, the conclusion of the convention was met with resentment and opposition from Russophile sections of the political class in Serbia, including opposition on the part of the then prime minister Milan Piroƒáanac. Under the treaty, Austria-Hungary pledged to support the Obrenoviƒá dynasty and recognise the Serbian prince as king, and acknowledged Serbia‚Ä≤s southward territorial claims; in return, Serbian undertook not to allow any agitation or military activity inimical to Austro-Hungarian interests, which notably included those in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sanjak of Novi Pazar; all foreign treaties of Serbia were to obtain Vienna‚Ä≤s prior approval.

Derryclare Lough is fed from rivers from Lough Inagh, which itself is fed from several mountain streams in the area, but most importantly from the Gleninagh River that starts high up in the Gleninagh Valley on the slopes of Benbaun and Bencollaghduff, and the Tooreennacoona River. Derryclare Lough flows into Ballynahinch Lake, where it eventually joins the Owenmore River, and flows into Bertraghboy Bay. Fishing Derryclare Lough is noted for its lake and river fishing with spring salmon, grilse and sea trout, and the fishing is done from \\"Butts\\" (e.g. long piers from the shore), and particularly the Derryclare Butts, Glendollagh Butts, and the Greenpoint Butts. The Lough and its fishing rights are privately owned and controlled by local fishing lodges in the Inagh Valley.

It was built from 1890s to 1900s. It is also known as Sandhills Historical South Sea Islander Cemetery. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Kanakas working in Farnborough, 1895 The use of the area that became the Joskeleigh Cemetery was established on privately owned land at Sandhills/Joskeleigh by the late 1890s/early 1900s by the local South Sea Islander community. By 1983 there were fifth-generation descendants of the original cane workers brought to the Rockhampton district in the late 19th century living in the Joskeleigh area. In the period 1863‚Äì1904, South Sea Islanders were the principal labour force in Queensland's sugar industry, and until about 1880 also worked in the pastoral and maritime industries. Approximately 50,000 Islanders took up indentures to work in Queensland in this period, many signing up more than once. Following federation of the Australian colonies in 1901 and the resultant triumph of the \\"White Australia\\" movement, the new Australian Government passed the Pacific Island Labourers Act of 1901, which proclaimed that the recruiting of South Sea Islands labour was to cease from 1904 and that as many Islanders as possible were to be repatriated by 1907. Between 1904 and 1908, 7,068 Islanders were repatriated and another 194 were deported in 1914. However, between 2,000 and 2,500 Islanders were exempt from repatriation and acquired Australian citizenship. In the late 1990s their descendants number around 15,000. In Queensland, Islanders were introduced firstly as labour in the cotton industry and on pastoral properties, and later to work on the sugar plantations along the coast. Clearing the land before planting the sugar cane. In the Rockhampton area, extensive sugar plantations were established in the Yeppoon, Farnborough, Cawarral, and Joskeleigh districts. Sugar was first tried at the Sand hills by Mr Joske (after whom Joskeleigh is named) but the land was too arid. The Yeppoon Sugar Plantation employed up to 180 South Sea Islander workers, both men and women. When forcible repatriation of Islanders was introduced by the Commonwealth Government in the early 1900s, the Islander population around Rockhampton comprised 79 island born, 47 Queensland born, and 8 married women not liable to deportation. No children were to be sent back, and of the island born all but 23 had lived in Queensland for more than 20 years and so could claim exemption from deportation. Of these 23, five were married to women who did not come from their own island, and so were permitted to remain, and the other 18 were able to stay because they were mostly earning their own living on land they either owned or leased. The majority of Islanders who chose to stay in Central Queensland settled in the Keppel Sands (originally Sandhills) area at Joskeleigh, which has a beach frontage of several kilometres and is the nearest ocean beach to Rockhampton. By 1914 the population was estimated at 200. The Joskeleigh School was established in 1915, and by the 1930s the population had peaked at around 250-300. The community estimates that the Islander population had a 10% intermarriage rate with an Aboriginal tribe which lived in the area until the 1930s, when the last of these Indigenous people were forcibly removed to reserves. The Islander community first rented land from Bill Cuff, the Sandhills storekeeper, for a nominal 2/6 per year, and on this they built thatched huts of blady grass in the traditional manner, with Tea Tree Bark and traditionally made rope from the wild hibiscus bark. The Islanders soon became self- sufficient by growing crops and market gardens to provide food and an income for their families. Their families grew up there and soon began buying their own blocks of land south of Mr Cuff's who first invited the South Sea Islanders to the Sandhills. He originally worked at the Yeppoon Sugar Plantation Sugar Mill at Farnborough. When the mill ceased to operate in 1904 he invited some of the Islanders who worked on the plantation to work for him on his newly purchased acreage. Another land owner, Alexander Charles Huth sold them some of his land. They worked for him in his gardens and with their earnings paid for their land. Traditional skills in fishing, net-making, medicine, horticulture and building continued to be practised and even taught in the local school, and this was a rich source of cultural pride and community cohesion. Between 1901 and 1914 the Islanders accepted Christianity, taught by Gospel hall missionaries from Rockhampton, but retained many of their island religious customs and spiritual beliefs. When someone died, a wake was held and in days gone by this celebration lasted for three days with a huge feast prepared and cooked island style. It was a happy time and celebrated that the spirit of the deceased had gone to a happier place. Inexpensive use of glass ornamentation, and shells around the graves, were used to decorate the graves. Shells were used quite often to decorate not only the graves, but also their garden beds. Glass ornamentation was used as the families could often not afford anything else. The Joskeleigh Cemetery is associated mostly with the first generation of Australian Islanders who resided at Sandhills. Twenty-two men, women and children are buried there, almost all Islanders except for one English women who had married into the community. Oral history suggests that there are other unmarked graves outside the boundaries of the cemetery. The burial ground, established on about a quarter of an acre of a 100-acre freehold at Sandhills, appears to have been abandoned when the Islander community took up their own land south of Sandhills. By the early 1980s the cemetery had been badly damaged by farm machinery. Twenty of the graves had been bulldozed; headstones were broken and picket fences had been burnt to clear some of the area. This caused considerable distress amongst Joskeleigh residents whose relatives were buried there. In response, the local Islander community, led by Mrs Mabel Edmund, encouraged the National Trust to list the site in 1981 and formed the Joskeleigh Historical and Progress Association in 1983 to preserve the place. Fund raising commenced and negotiations with the then landholder were undertaken in order to purchase the area of land where the graves were located. These discussions were unsuccessful and the Association, led by Mrs Edmund, lobbied the Queensland Government to resume the burial ground and officially declare it a reserve for cemetery purposes. This was achieved in 1984. The State Government bought a quarter acre of land surrounding most of the graves to preserve the area as an historical site. The land was held in trust by the Joskeleigh Historical Society, however in recent times this has been handed over to the Livingstone Shire Council. The community also maintains the grounds. Little restoration work was undertaken until 1991, when graves were marked; headstones re-erected where possible; a stone monument was erected with a plaque which bears the names of all those buried in the cemetery; a fence and gates were constructed and a sign painted. The most recent burial in the Joskeleigh Cemetery was Mrs Evelyn Warcon in 2001. The Joskeleigh Cemetery has become an important and attractive part of the landscape and a source of pride to the community and a permanent reminder of South Sea Islander heritage.  Description  The South Sea Islander village of Joskeleigh is located from Rockhampton, on the coast. The cemetery site comprised approximately a quarter of an acre and was originally part of a 100-acre freehold block. It is bounded on the north by Joskeleigh Road and to the south, west and east by freehold property on which is located mature vegetation, including mango and pine trees. All headstones within the cemetery face easterly. The plaque bearing the names of those buried there is mounted on a large memorial stone. Oral history suggests that some Islanders are buried outside the present cemetery boundaries [in some cases it is said that people are buried outside of the cemetery grounds even though their headstones are located within the grounds]. Glass ornamentation and shells surround most the graves. Shells were used quite often to decorate not only the graves, but also garden beds. Some graves are marked with timber crucifixes. There are a number of marble headstones, one of which has a metal grave surround. A timber rotunda is located with the cemetery. The cemetery is surrounded by a timber fence with access via Joskeleigh Road.  Heritage listing  Joskeleigh Cemetery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Joskeleigh Cemetery is important in illustrating the pattern of Queensland's history as evidence of the development of Joskeleigh and surrounding area as a settlement predominantly of South Sea Islander people, who owned or leased land, farmed it, and lived in the area since the 1890s. A well-known landmark, Joskeleigh Cemetery, with its grave surrounds, markers and headstones, set in a tended lawn, with the surrounding area bounded by mature vegetation, particularly mango and pine trees, is significant for its aesthetic appeal. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Joskeleigh Cemetery is comparatively rare in Queensland, as the final resting place for, predominantly, South Sea Islander people. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Joskeleigh Cemetery illustrates some of the principal characteristics of a small burial ground, including a lack of denominational divisions and locally connected interments. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Joskeleigh Cemetery is especially important for its strong social significance and for the association it holds for descendants of the early South Sea Islander families of Joskeleigh and surrounding area with their heritage and the experiences of their ancestors in Queensland.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 April 2008.  History  In 1867, residents of Rockhampton signed a petition asking the Surveyor-General to mark out a town at the nearest point on the central Queensland coast where they might be able to enjoy a day at the beach. Although Yeppoon, then known as \\"Bald Hills\\", was proclaimed as a Town Reserve, as a watering place for Rockhampton on 30 April 1868, for many years access to it was difficult, the first road with culverts being built in 1878. It suffered in its rivalry with Emu Park (declared a Town Reserve on 9 January 1869), where land was taken up by influential Rockhampton businessmen and squatters from further west who built holiday houses there. These two resort towns were among the first in Queensland and the first on the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Pastoralists and selectors were the first to settle and develop the Yeppoon area. The first land sale was held on 4 August 1873 when P. F. McDonald, the pastoralist and investor bought 15 of the 17 blocks sold, and local selectors two. Yeppoon town site lay in a hollow between steep hills, below the line of dunes, and in wet weather it was swampy. The only large enterprise was the Yeppoon Sugar Plantation, which in its twenty years of existence was handicapped by the lack of roads and rail. Yeppoon with a higher rainfall than Rockhampton or Emu Park, and fertile soil, became an agricultural area with land near the town occupied by selectors within 10 years of its proclamation and surrounding areas being used for grazing. The beginning of the 1880s brought changes to the district as people began to take more of an interest in the town. Between 1881 and 1884, it was predominantly residents of the area who purchased the remaining 30 town lots. These lots had not sold at the first land sales in 1873. When an additional town area was surveyed in 1881, however, these lots had all sold out by 1885. The first length of rail line in the region was opened to Westwood some thirty miles (fifty kilometres) from Rockhampton in 1867. The line was extended beyond the coastal ranges in 1872, reaching Emerald in 1879. The Central Western railway was progressively extended further west reaching Longreach in 1892, and remained an isolated railway system, with no connection to railways in southern Queensland railways until 1903 when the North Coast railway line connected them. In Brisbane a railway line to Sandgate was completed in May 1882, later extended to Shorncliffe, giving residents access to the beach. It is one of the few surviving seaside stations; others including Pialba, Urangan, Cleveland, Southport, Tweed Heads and Coolangatta have been demolished. Following this southern success, the Rockhampton owners of holiday houses at Emu Park also wanted a railway. Their petitions were successful and a railway line was constructed from North Rockhampton railway station to Emu Park was approved in 1885 and opened in December 1888. Because of the cost of building a railway bridge across the Fitzroy River, the railway to Emu Park commenced at North Rockhampton and did not extend to the main Rockhampton railway station; thus it too was a disconnnected railway line. In addition to seaside passengers, the railway also served the Lakes Creek Meatworks and gold mining at Cawarral and New Zealand Gully. It ensured that Emu Park gained the holiday traffic, and the township grew rapidly. In 1899, the Rockhampton Junction railway line would connect the Emu Park railway line to the Archer Park railway station (now the Archer Park Rail Museum) on the south side of the Fitzroy River via the Alexandra Railway Bridge. Railway tracks at Yeppoon, circa 1938 Yeppoon residents and the Sugar Plantation agitated for an extension to Yeppoon, for without it rail travellers continued to take the train to Tanby, then coach to Yeppoon. In 1890 a survey for a rail corridor to Yeppoon was undertaken and a second in 1900. The extension to Yeppoon was approved, and the first section of five kilometres from Sleipner (New Zealand Gully) to Mount Chalmers was opened in November 1908 to transport workers, supplies and metal. The next to Yeppoon was opened on 20 December 1909, in time for the Christmas traffic. The official opening was by the Queensland Governor, Sir William MacGregor on 21 January 1910. The passenger station, engine shed and a carriage shed were built in 1909. A parcels and luggage room were added in 1910. By 1943 the complex included a goods shed, station master's house, guards' quarters, drivers' quarters, forkline and loading ramp. The goods shed was relocated within the railyard in 1966. Tourist services to Yeppoon and Emu Park departed from the passenger-only Archer Park railway station in Rockhampton. Also serving other passenger services to Mount Morgan, St Lawrence and Mackay, the station closed in February 1970. On the first Rockhampton-Yeppoon train 128 passengers travelled, paying three shillings and ten pence for a second-class fare. On Boxing Day 1910, 700 people attended the traditional races on Yeppoon Beach. Large group picnics brought full trains to Yeppoon on weekends. An exceptionally large one was a Railway workers' picnic on the beach in 1924 which 3,500 people attended. The railway with fares much cheaper than the coach, opened Yeppoon to all classes and brought rapid progress. Betty Cosgrove has written: \\"very few working class people went to Yeppoon until the 20th century\\", but it became more popular than Emu Park with an ambience more tolerant and welcoming. The train to Yeppoon became the predominant means of travel to Yeppoon until after World War 2. The siting of Yeppoon railway station one kilometre from the beach was not for the convenience of holiday makers, but for freight handling. On flat land on the edge of the town it allowed the loading of produce including cattle which could be yarded on the western end of the complex. Its position did not deter residents and visitors from \\"meeting the train\\", a practice continued from that of meeting the coach from Rockhampton. Passengers were the interest, and people \\"dressed\\" for the train's arrival. Pineapples became a major crop in the district and the main freight carried. In 1953 a cannery opened at Koongal, Rockhampton, to which pineapples were railed. When it closed pineapples were railed to the cannery at Northgate in wagons adapted for bulk transport. Boarding schools for girls were opened in Yeppoon in 1917 and 1923, allowing families on the Central Western railway line to send their daughters direct to Yeppoon. During the most fearful period of World War 2, when a Japanese invasion seemed imminent, St Faiths School was evacuated to Barcaldine in February 1942, with girls, beds, desks, pianos and boxes of books sent west by rail. The boarders from St Ursula's college were similarly evacuated to Our Ladies' College at Longreach. With approximately 70,000 American troops in the Rockhampton district, troop movements within the district were by road, but soldiers on leave patronised the train. On Sunday 20 September 1942 all seaside trains out of Rockhampton were cancelled, as lines and rolling stock had to be available for transport of the troops who were then moving out to New Guinea. The camp sites were quiet until March 1943. Peak passenger numbers were in 1950 with 40,083 passengers. After World War 2 car ownership became widespread, the Rockhampton-Yeppoon road improved and passenger travel on the railway fell. In 1964 the service to Emu Park closed and the station building has been demolished. Also in 1964 the weekday service to Yeppoon was provided by rail car and passenger services withdrawn in the 1970s. Up until the 1970s the lack of an all weather sealed road over the Drummond Range to ensured that the railway line remained the best method of holiday transport from the west to Yeppoon which had gained the unofficial title of \\"rouseabout's Bondi\\". The line has been used sporadically for freight or tourist services since. Occasional special heritage trips were made in the early 1980s. In 2004 Queensland Rail announced that pineapple traffic would be put onto road transport and the Yeppoon line would be closed and dismantled. Investigation found that a possible commuter/tourist service would not be viable. By mid 2007 work had commenced on removing rails, sleepers, signals and other infrastructure.  Description  Yeppoon railway station, 2011 The station complex is located on the northern side of James Street at the western end of the main commercial precinct. The passenger station is a long gable-roofed chamferboard building with a corrugated galvanised iron roof with square \\"fascia\\" gutters. On the street side, the roof extends to form a shade supported on timber posts by solid timber brackets. Large decorative brackets are spaced at regular intervals under the eaves. The lowset building is set on concrete stumps. Concrete steps lead up to doorways, a small timber landing is situated adjacent to a boarded up window of the ticket and freight office. Several metres from the building, two long sandstone block steps, topped with concrete run along half the length (western end) of the building. Some panelled doors remain, but the door to the ticket and freight office has been replaced with a flush sliding door. Windows are 4-pane colonial sash. The platform side has a curved shade supported on timber posts with plain struts and concrete bases. A section on the eastern end is enclosed with battens to form a storage area for a forklift. The platform on which the station building sits is concrete edged and is of compacted soil topped with blue metal gravel and is furnished with a single timber bench seat bearing the word \\"YEPPOON\\" in black letters. Two similar seats are placed on the street side of the building. On either end of the building a timber sign is mounted off the wall at an angle, painted dark green and with raised letters painted beige to match the building bearing the name \\"YEPPOON\\". The ticket and freight office, located at the western end of the building is a large rectangular space with walls and ceiling lined with tongue and groove boards. A set of cupboards is built into the western end of the room to waist height. It has four doors and a safe located in the centre, below the window to the waiting room. Wall- mounted timber shelving is located to the right of the window. The room contains a mix of modern and original furnishings and fixtures. Two panelled timber doors with square fanlights above open to the platform. Two windows open to the platform and two to the street side. The former waiting room is adjacent to the ticket and freight office and is enclosed to the platform side by timber battens with a door offset to the eastern end. It has a window opening to the ticket and freight office. The parcels room is a large open space with centrally located double timber doors opening to the outside of the building on either side. The western wall is lined with four shelves. The roof and walls are lined with tongue and groove boards. The floor is of timber boards. The wall to the platform side has exposed framing. At the eastern end of the building are male and female toilets with doors opening to the platform side.  Heritage listing  Yeppoon Station Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 April 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Yeppoon Railway Station is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history. The terminal of branch line opened in 1909, it is important surviving evidence of a rail service to a seaside resort. Passengers from Rockhampton and throughout Central West Queensland used the service to Yeppoon. The line also contributed to coastal development serving mining, agricultural, educational and pastoral interests in the area. In particular it was important in the establishment of Yeppoon as a centre for boarding schools to service Central Queensland. It recalls an era when the railway played an important role in conveying day trippers to the seaside and complements Archer Park (Archer Park Rail Museum), the principal point of departure for passengers on this railway. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Yeppoon station building is important as a rare surviving and substantially intact seaside resort station, comparing with Shorncliffe and Pialba and others including Urangan, Cleveland, Southport, Tweeds Heads and Coolangatta since demolished. The extant earth platform is also rare in Queensland.

The festival is marked by a ritual dip in the waters, but it is also a celebration of community commerce with numerous fairs, education, religious discourses by saints, mass feedings of monks or the poor, and entertainment spectacle., Quote: \\"The special power of the Kumbha Mela is often said to be due in part to the presence of large numbers of Hindu monks, and many pilgrims seek the darsan (Skt., darsana; auspicious mutual sight) of these holy men. Others listen to religious discourses, participate in devotional singing, engage brahman priests for personal rituals, organize mass feedings of monks or the poor, or merely enjoy the spectacle. Amid this diversity of activities, the ritual bath at the conjunction of time and place is the central event of the Kumbha Mela.\\" The full Kumbh mela is held every 12 years, while an ardha (half) mela is held after about 6 years at the same site. The 2013 Kumbh mela was the largest religious gathering in the world with almost 120 million visitors. An Ardh Kumbh Mela was held in early 2019. The next full Kumbh mela is scheduled for 2025. The exact date is based on the Hindu luni-solar calendar and is determined by the entry of planet Jupiter in Taurus zodiac and while the sun and the moon is in Capricorn. The Mela is one of the four fairs traditionally recognized as Kumbh Melas. An annual fair, known as Magh Mela, has been held at Prayag Triveni sangam since ancient times (at least early centuries CE). The site, its sacredness, bathing pilgrimage and the annual festival is mentioned in the ancient Puranas and the epic Mahabharata. The festival is also mentioned in later era texts such as those by Muslim historians of the Mughal Empire. However, these sources do not use the phrase \\"Kumbh Mela\\" for the bathing festival at Prayag (renamed Allahabad during the Mughal era). The earliest mention of a Kumbh Mela at Allahabad occurs only after the mid-19th century in colonial era documents. The Prayagwals (local Brahmins of Prayag) are believed to have adopted the kumbha and the 12-year cycle of the historic Haridwar Kumbh Mela for their annual Magh Mela around this time. Since then, every 12 years, the Magh Mela turns into a Kumbh Mela, and six years after a Kumbh Mela, it is an Ardh Kumbh (\\"Half Kumbh\\") Mela.  Dates  The Kumbh Mela at Allahabad is held in the month of Magh when Jupiter is in Aries, and Sun and Moon are in Capricorn; or Jupiter is in Taurus, and Sun in Capricorn. However, at times this astrological combiniation (Kumbh Yoga) does not coincide with the month of Magh. In such a case, the mela is still held in Magh. For example, the 1989 Kumbh Mela should have begun in mid- March according to astrological calculations; however, it started in January. There have been multiple incidences of Hindu astrologers disagreeing over the exact condition that ushers in a mela. As a result, fairs claimed to be Kumbh Melas have been at the same place in successive years. For example, 1941 and 1942 in Allahabad; and again, 1965 and 1966 in Allahabad. History According to Hindu mythology, Vishnu dropped drops of amrita (the drink of immortality) at four places, while transporting it in a kumbha (pot). These four places, including Allahabad, are identified as the present-day sites of the Kumbh Mela. The river-side fair at Allahabad is centuries old, but its association with the kumbha myth and a 12-year old cycle dates back to the 19th century. The priests of Allahabad borrowed these concepts from the Haridwar Kumbh Mela and applied it to their local Magh Mela, an annual celebration. The Magh Mela probably dates back to the early centuries CE, and has been mentioned in several Puranas. = Early records of the Magh Mela = Ashoka pillar at Allahabad (photo c. 1900) contains many inscriptions since the 3rd-century BCE. Sometime about 1575 CE, Birbal of Akbar's era added an inscription that mentions the \\"Magh mela at Prayag Tirth Raj\\". The writings of the Chinese traveler Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang) possibly contain a reference to an ancient version of this fair in 644 CE. Xuanzang mentions that Emperor Shiladitya (identified with Harsha) distributed his wealth among the public once every five years; his treasury was then replenished by his vassals. He describes such a ritual at a site located at the confluence of two rivers, in the kingdom of Po-lo-ye-kia (identified with Prayaga). He also mentions that many hundreds take a bath at the confluence of two rivers, to wash away their sins.Buddhist Records of the Western World, Book V by Xuan Zang According to some scholars, this is earliest surviving historical account of the Kumbh Mela or its predecessor. However, Australian researcher Kama Maclean notes that the Xuanzang reference is about an event that happened every 5 years (and not 12 years), and might have been a Buddhist celebration (since, according to Xuanzang, Harsha was a Buddhist emperor). A common conception, advocated by the akharas, is that Adi Shankara started the Kumbh Mela at Prayag in the 8th century, to facilitate meeting of holy men from different regions. However, academics doubt the authenticity of this claim. There is no record of a Kumbh Mela with a 12-year cycle at Prayag before the 19th century. The Prayag Mahatmya section of the Matsya Purana states the exalted holiness of Prayag in the Magha month, but does not mention any \\"Kumbh Mela\\". Bengal's prominent spiritual leader Chaitanya visited Prayag in 1514, and participated in a bath on the Makara Sankranti. The Bengali language source Chaitanya Charitamrita mentions that he visited a Magh Mela (and not a Kumbh Mela). The 16th century Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas mentions the mela in Allahabad as an annual one, but does not contain any reference to a 12-year cycle. Tabaqat-i-Akbari (c. 1590s) of Nizamuddin Ahmad also mentions that the mela as annual. It states that after the rabi harvest, Hindus came to the Triveni Sangam in such large numbers that the jungles and the plains were not sufficient to hold them. Ain- i-Akbari, also from the 16th century, mentions that Allahabad is especially holy in the month of Magha. Khulasat-ut-Tawarikh (c. 1695-1699) uses the term \\"Kumbh Mela\\" to describe only the Mela at Haridwar; it only mentions the existence of an annual Mela at Allahabad. Yadgar-i-Bahaduri (1834 CE) similarly mentions that the mela at Allahabad is held every winter in Magha, when the sun enters the Capricorn. The British East India Company gained control of the Allahabad area after the Treaty of Allahabad in 1765. The early British records contain detailed information about the annual Magh Mela at Allahabad, collected for tax-related and administrative purposes. But none of these records call the mela by the name \\"Kumbh\\", nor do they suggest any specific significance (such as larger crowds) to a Mela held every 12th year. In contrast, there are multiple references to the name \\"Kumbh Mela\\" as well as a 12-year cycle for the Haridwar Kumbh Mela. There are several records of applications from Hindu princes seeking tax-free attendance at the Mela at Allahabad. Again, all of these describe the mela as an annual one. Bholanath Chunder (1869) of Asiatic Society also mentions \\"the especial great mela\\" at Allahabad as an annual one, held in January. Some of the Company-era Magh Melas include: ; 1790 : A letter from Scindia praises a Muslim named Mir Muhammad Amjad for rendering good service to Hindu pilgrims from the Deccan. Amjad was an officer of Asaf-ud-daula. Asaf-ud-Daula, the Nawab of Awadh, greatly reduced the pilgrim tax this year. ; 1801 : The Company outsourced the tax collection at the mela to a native to escape the complexity of the tax system as well as the accusations of profiting from the non-Christian practices. ; 1806 : The Company took over the pilgrim tax collection, and imposed a tax of 1 for anyone who wanted to bathe at the Mela. According to Welsh travel writer Fanny Parkes, the tax was severe: in those days 1 rupee was enough to keep a man \\"in comfort for one month\\". Another contemporary source puts the tax imposed by company at 3 and mentions greater expense is incurred in charity and gifts to Brahmins sitting by the river side. ; 1808 : The Company announced waiving of pilgrim taxes for native soldiers wishing to bathe at Allahabad. This move was intended at strengthening their loyalty to the British government. ; 1812 : The Company made arrangements for a \\"great\\" congregation of people at the \\"melah\\" that had not occurred in 28 years. ; 1833 : Bishunath Singh, the prince of Rewa, refused to pay tax on the grounds that he did not take a bath. However, the local British Collector sent Rewa a tax bill of 5,490 (a hefty amount in those days), on the basis that he had employed Prayagwals, and people in his retinue had their heads tonsured. ; 1836 : The Raja of Rewa requested the British to grant an tax exemption for his 5000-strong retinue. The British agreed to grant an exemption only for 1000 people. An angry Raja abandoned his trip to Allahabad. ; 1840 : The British abolished the pilgrim taxes as \\"a measure calculated to augment the popularity of Government... in these disaffected times\\". : A huge number of people attended the Magh Mela that year. A stampede occurred, in which 2 people were killed and another 2 were injured. Like the Haridwar mela, the Prayag mela also had a mercantile component, but on a far smaller scale. European traveler Charles James C. Davidson visited the fair twice, and described it in his book Diary of Travels and Adventures in Upper India (1843). According to him, the wares put up for sale at the mela were low-value items \\"usually found in all Indian fairs\\". = Transformation of the Magh Mela into Kumbh Mela = It is difficult to determine the exact year in which the Magh Mela was first celebrated as a Kumbh Mela. The 1870 fair at Allahabad is the earliest fair that is described as a \\"Kumbh Mela\\" by contemporary sources. The previous Kumbh Mela would have been scheduled in 1858; but that year, no fair was held in Allahabad because of disturbances resulting from the 1857 uprising. Before that, a Kumbh Mela would have been held in 1846, but there are no records to suggest this. In 1874, G. H. M. Ricketts ‚Äî the Commissioner of Allahabad ‚Äî wrote that the fair became more sacred every seventh year, and attracted a larger number of pilgrims and merchants. Beyond this, he wrote, the administration had little knowledge of the factors that resulted in increased or decreased attendance at the fair in a given year. The earliest reference to a Kumbh Mela at Allahabad is from a British report of 1868. In this report, G. H. M. Ricketts (then the Magistrate of Allahabad) discusses the need for sanitation controls at the \\"Coomb fair\\" (Kumbh Mela) to be held in 1870. He also mentions that he had witnessed huge crowd at an \\"Ad Coomb\\" (Ardh Kumbh) four years earlier. In his report on the 1870 Magh Mela, the Commissioner of Allahabad J. C. Robertson also stated that this year's fair was a \\"Koombh\\". This report is also the earliest extant source that mentions a procession of sadhus at Allahabad; this procession occurs only during a Kumbh Mela, and not during a Magh Mela. Historian Kama Maclean hypothesizes that the 1870 Mela was the first fair at Allahabad to be called a \\"Kumbh Mela\\". Historically, the Magh Mela has been an important source of income for the Prayagwal Brahmins of Allahabad. The British attempts to profit from the Mela by imposing a hefty religious tax on the pilgrims brought the Company into direct conflict with the Prayagwals. Even after the Company abolished the pilgrim tax in 1840, it continued to levy taxes on traders and service providers (such as barbers) at the Mela. The first British reference to the Kumbh Mela in Prayag occurs only in an 1868 report, which mentions the need for increased pilgrimage and sanitation controls at the \\"Coomb fair\\" to be held in January 1870. According to Maclean, the Prayagwals coopted the Kumbh legend and brand from Haridwar to the ancient annual Prayag Magh Mela given the socio-political circumstances in the 19th-century. =Christian missionaries attack on Hinduism= The Prayagwals along the general Hindu community disliked the presence of Christian missionaries at the Mela. Prayagwals objected to and campaigned against the colonial government supported Christian missionaries and officials who treated them and the pilgrims as \\"ignorant co-religionists\\" and who aggressively tried to convert the Hindu pilgrims to a Christian sect. According to Maclean, the missionaries distributed literature ‚Äì printed in Indian languages ‚Äì at the large pilgrimage gathering of Hindus at Allahabad. These attacked the Hindu \\"devotional practices\\", \\"Rama and Lachmad [sic]\\", the idolatry and Hindu rituals. Some of the missionary literature accused the Prayag pilgrimage as \\"mere superstition\\" and \\"not even sanctioned in the higher sacred books of the Hindus\\". The Prayagwals and other Hindus found this offensive. They argued ‚Äì \\"powerfully\\" states Maclean ‚Äì that Hindus were not given the freedom under the British government to enter Christian premises, set up camps, preach and distribute their religious material to Christians near their churches or criticize Christianity on Christian festivals. In contrast, the Christian missionaries under the protection of the British government do exactly that to the Hindu community that gathers to celebrate their own festival. This orientalistic discrimination, the newspapers stated was because of \\"the helplessness of the mild Hindu who identifies his Christian rulers with the Padres and fears to raise his hand against the White Preacher or his black converts.\\" The government ignored these petitions, states Maclean, \\"perhaps recognizing that once missionaries had been excised from the [Kumbh] mela, government would be next\\". Despite the aggressive proselytization methods used by Christian missionaries at the Prayag Kumbh melas, states Maclean, they had little success in converting any Hindus there. However, it did help develop vibrant Hindu-owned printing press operations, in reaction to the Christian missionary tactics, that began publishing and widely distributing pro-Kumbh mela, pro- Hindu and anti-colonial literature. =1857 rebellion= The colonial government accused the Prayagwals of contributing to the unrest in Allahabad and in part, for the outbreak of the 1857 uprising at Allahabad. According to the colonial archives, the Praygawal community helped seed and perpetuate the resistance against the Christian missionaries and the 1857 rebellion to the colonial rule. During the 1857 rebellion, Colonel Neill targeted the Kumbh mela site and shelled the region where the Prayagwals lived, destroying it in what Maclean describes as a \\"notoriously brutal pacification of Allahabad\\". Prayagwals too targeted and destroyed the \\"mission press and churches in Allahabad\\". Once the British had regained control of the region, the Prayagwals were persecuted by the colonial officials, some convicted and hanged, while others ‚Äì for whom the government did not have proof enough to convict ‚Äì were persecuted nevertheless. Large tracts of Kumbh mela lands near the Ganga-Yamuna confluence were confiscated and annexed into the government cantonment. In the years after 1857, the Prayagwals and the Kumbh Mela pilgrim crowds carried flags with images alluding to the rebellion and the racial persecution. The British media reported these pilgrim assemblies and protests at the later Kumbh Mela as \\"strangely hostile\\" and with \\"disbelief\\", states Maclean.  British Raj  Mid-19th century onwards, the improving road and railway networks helped the pilgrims. However, the attendance varied over time for many reasons and reliable estimates of attendance are scant. The historical and modern estimates of attendance vary greatly between sources. For example, the colonial era Imperial Gazetteer of India reported that between 2 to 2.5 million pilgrims attended the Kumbh mela in 1796 and 1808, then added these numbers may be exaggerations. Between 1892 and 1908, in an era of major famines, cholera and plague epidemics in British India, the pilgrimage dropped to between 300,000 to 400,000.Haridwar The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 13, pp. 52‚Äì53 The British government collected taxes, as well as began managing the camping and mela services particularly from the 1860s onwards. It allowed missionaries to camp and distribute their literature, appointed Muslim officials to manage the festival reasoning they were more indifferent to the holy men and \\"superstitions\\" at the festival, gave official licenses to \\"gambling carnivals\\". The Hindus objected to these appointments and licenses, petitioned against the voyeurism, found the favoritism to and presence of Muslim officials as unacceptable and asked for Hindu officials to lead the festival. Over time, the communal sentiments intensified and the Kumbh mela became an \\"ideal place to articulate and promote Hindu interests\\". However, the Kumbh festival itself remained peaceful and \\"not a venue for Hindu-Muslim violence\\", states Maclean. ; Kumbh mela, 1882 :The mela became a source of scandal when a Muslim named Husain was appointed as the Kumbh Mela manager, and Indian newspaper reports stated that Husain had \\"organized a flotilla of festooned boats for the pleasure of European ladies and gentlemen, and entertained them with dancing girls, liquor and beef\\" as they watched the pilgrims bathing. ; Ardha Kumbh Mela, 1888 : A Christian missionary asked the government not to get involved in organization of Kumbh Mela as it made them complicit in idolatry. However, the Magistrate of Allahabad refused to oblige, arguing that the British involvement was necessary to keep the militarized Sadhus under control. : Prayag Samachar, a newsletter, blamed Muslims for lighting a fire at the mela. : District Magistrate Porter tried to ban nudity, arguing that no Hindu scriptures authorized it. He was supported by the Commissioner of Allahabad, but Lieutenant Governor Auckland Colvin rejected the idea. Colvin, a former Magistrate of Allahabad, argued that there was no need to interfere in a Hindu ceremony which only the Hindus needed to attend. ; Kumbh Mela, 1894 : According to Paramahansa Yogananda in his work the Autobiography of a Yogi, it was during the Kumbh Mela in January 1894 at Prayag that his Guru Sri Yukteswar met Mahavatar Babaji for the first time.Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda Chapter 36 Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda, wikisource. ; Kumbh Mela, 1906 : In 1905, a group of prayagwals ceased eating at a charitable feast due to presence of a Muslim police officer. Prayag Samachar, which frequently published communal sentiments ‚Äì urged the government to ban Muslim police from the area. : A clash between the Naga Sadhus occurred at the 1906 Mela. The police ordered a cavalry charge to break up the conflict. ; Kumbh Mela, 1942 : In 1941, the Government banned sale of tickets intending to travel to Allahabad during 4 January - 4 February 1942. Due to Japan's entry into the World War II, the Government wanted to keep the number of attendees low. There were rumours that Japan was going to bomb Allahabad. : Also, in 1941, Daraganj-based Mahanirvani Akhara asked the Government to ban the presence of non-Hindus (Muslim police and Christian missionaries) at the mela. The Akhara also expressed displeasure with granting of official licenses to \\"gambling carnivals\\" at the mela. Many newly prosperous villagers started attending the Mela a status symbol, and documented their claimed lineages in the registers of the Pryagwals.

The date of the text is disputed amongst biblical scholars. Either from the second century AD of Marcus Aurelius's reign or the third century AD of Decius's reign.  Narrative overview  Carpus, a bishop from Gurdos, Lydia, Papylus, a deacon from Thyatira, and Papylus's sister Agathonice were at the time, together in Pergamum. While present in the city, the Roman governor Pergamos invited them to eat meat that was offered to idols. Realizing this, both Carpus and Papylus refused because they were Christians. After being interrogated, the governor and the cities's counsel called, \\"Optimus\\" ordered them to sacrifice to their gods in the name of the emperor. Carpus was the first to refuse the counsel's orders because of his Christian faith. The counsel ordered his death through hanging and to be clawed alive. Papylus, a wealthy Roman citizen, followed the footsteps of Carpus the same death and torture as Agathonice committed suicide after their deaths.  Agathonice perceived in different versions of the acts  The earliest known woman to be martyred from Eusebius's written works, Agathonice witnessed the death of her brother Papylus and Bishop Carpus. Her death is presented differently amongst the Greek and Latin versions of the acts. Eusebius's Greek version of the text presents Agathonice as a bystander amongst the crowd. While watching Carpus's death in horror, Agathonice threw herself naked in the fire blazing pyre. Despite the crowd's effort to persuade her for the sake of her son, she shouted against them clarifying that God will have pity on her son. The Latin version has been defined as a longer and more detailed narrative. Instead of a bystander, Agathonice is a key witness in Carpus's trial. During his trial, she strips herself naked and the crowd becomes astonished by her action and her beauty. After Carpus is put to death, she was ordered to sacrifice to their gods. She refuses to do so, even though the crowd tried to persuade her for the sake of her children, she clarifies to them that God will watch her children. She was put to death by being hanged and burned.  Manuscripts and possible dates of authorship  The only known manuscripts of the Acts of Carpus, Papylus, and Agathonice are preserved in Greek and Latin (Longer version). Eusebius places the persecutions during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, which some biblical scholars assign a date to the second century AD. However, the Latin version's qualities points to the third century AD of Decius's reign, and with these differences, scholars can't conclude the actual date because of the two suggested emperors in which the acts occurred.

For her work on Making a Murderer, Ricciardi is the recipient of three Primetime Emmy Awards. Education Ricciardi graduated from Manhattan College in 1992 with a bachelor's degree in English and government.https://manhattan.edu/news/jasper-alumna-takes-spotlight-co- creator-netflixs-making-murderer-docu-series She then earned a Juris Doctor from New York Law School and an MFA in film from Columbia University School of the Arts. Her thesis film was recommended for a National Board of Review student award. In 2007, she received a filmmaking grant from The Peter S. Reed Foundation.  Career   Prior to working in film, Ricciardi worked as a lawyer. In 2002, she worked as a production assistant on two episodes of In the Life, a LGBT newsmagazine produced by PBS. Ricciardi and Moira Demos met while graduate students in Columbia University's film program in 2005. The two learned about Steven Avery, a convict in Wisconsin released due to DNA evidence, only to be accused of another crime, after reading an article in the New York Times. Both thought the case could make for an interesting documentary. Before meeting with Netflix, the company that ultimately chose to produce the series, Demos and Ricciardi met with executives at PBS and HBO, but neither network was interested in the project. The series premiered in December 2015 to positive reviews. Review aggregator site Metacritic awarded it a score of 85 out of 100, indicating mostly positive reviews. Ricciardi went on to win three Emmys for her work on Making a Murderer: Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series, Outstanding Directing For Nonfiction Programming, and Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming all three of which she shared with Moira Demos. In 2018 Demos and Ricciardi released a second season of Making a Murderer. Personal life Ricciardi is in a long- term relationship with director Moira Demos.

He worked in the areas of precision and quantum measurements, the detection of gravitational waves, systems with low dissipation, and fundamental thermodynamic fluctuations.  Biography  Braginsky was born in Moscow and graduated from the Physics Department of Moscow State University in 1954, where he had been working since 1955. In 1959, he defended his thesis, and in 1967 his doctoral thesis. In 1969, he was appointed a professor.  Scientific career  In the 1970s, Braginsky headed the Physics Department of Moscow State University. In the 1987 to 2001 period, he headed the department of \\"Molecular Physics and Physical Measurements\\". From 2001 to 2002, he was the head of the department of \\"Physics of oscillations.\\" Braginsky is the author of over 240 articles and 4 monographs. He predicted and experimentally demonstrated ponderomotive effects of friction and stiffness in the electromagnetic field of the resonator (1967). These effects underlie many modern developments in macroscopic quantum mechanics, in particular, optical and micro cooling nanooscillators to the zero state. It proves that units of the electron charge and the proton at 10‚àí21 (1970) and demonstrated the validity of the equivalence principle at the level of 10‚àí12 (1971). They predicted the existence of the limits of the sensitivity of the coordinate measurements of quantum origin, now called the standard quantum limit (1967), proposed and justified principles for a new class of measurement, allowing to overcome these limitations (quantum non-demolition measurements, 1977). Beginning in 1974, together with colleagues in the department, he discovered the existence of a fundamental loss mechanism for electromagnetic waves in perfect crystals, dielectrics, thereby creating dielectric microwave resonators in sapphire with Q > 109. In 1989, he suggested high-Q optical microcavities with whispering gallery modes. Together with colleagues, he developed a number of key elements for the detectors of gravitational waves (both the bars and the laser interferometers), in particular the suspension of the proof mass with a relaxation time greater than 5 years. Braginsky and colleagues also predicted the existence of several new physical effects: the spin-quadrupole gravitational effect (1980), the friction generated by zero-point fluctuations of the vacuum (1991), and fundamental thermoelastic and thermorefractive fluctuations (1999, 2000), and parametric instabilities in high-Q opto-mechanical resonators (2001). Since 1993, the research group of Braginsky has been working within the international research project called LIGO. Braginsky has also produced a large cadre of students: of the 34 PhD candidates prepared, 12 have achieved the Doctor of Science degree, including six professors working in various departments of the Faculty of Physics at Moscow State University. Some of his other former students successfully work in institutes of the RAS and abroad.

It was built in 1921 and 1984. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 July 1999.  History  The Yeppoon War Memorial comprises a series of avenues of trees, located over Anzac Parade, James and Normanby Streets planted in 1921 and 1984, to commemorate the servicemen lost from the local community. The ANZAC Parade avenue of trees was officially opened on 26 December 1929 by the Chairman of the Livingstone Shire Council, Cr, T. Smith, whilst driving through ribbons held by returned servicemen in uniform. The memorial obelisk, erected in 1952, is located in Beaman Park at the intersection of Normanby and James Streets, commemorates all servicemen and women from the Yeppoon district. Together they create an integrated precinct of remembrance for the international conflicts in which Australia participated. Up until the early twentieth century, there were few statues or monuments in Queensland. However, as a result of the First World War (1914-1918), memorials were erected in almost every Queensland town. Such public expression of both grief for the dead and pride in the nation has not been generated by previous or subsequent wars. Memorials erected following subsequent wars were often adjuncts to the original commemorative symbols. The First World War had an enormous impact on the Australian population. Of those who went to war, almost one in five did not return. It was common for families to lose more than one son and for small communities to lose a whole generation of men. In 1916, the British Government prohibited the exhumation and return of bodies. This, coupled with the impracticality of visiting distant graves ensured war memorials became an expression of public mourning, revered as cenotaphs (literally meaning empty tomb) by those who erected them. Placed in prominent locations, such as planting of memorial trees in Yeppoon's main thoroughfares, they became symbols of remembrance and were considered to be as sacred as gravesites. Materials, design principles and symbols suggesting permanence, reverence and commemoration were important elements. In Yeppoon, trees symbolising continuing life were planted in 1921, at The Esplanade, James and Normanby Streets, as the original public commemoration. Native Australian Hoop Pines were selected as the preferred tree, suited to the harsh seaside conditions and longevity of up to 700 years making them an ideal choice for a continuing memorial. At this time The Esplanade was renamed Anzac Parade. While the trees in Anzac Parade flourished, those in James Street declined after the 1940s. Most of the memorial plaques for individual lost soldiers located under trees in James Street had disappeared. In 1984, Yeppoon Returned Services League and Livingstone Shire Council cooperated to replace the trees and plaques and to extend the memorial to those who died in World War Two, Korea and Vietnam. Palm Trees were planted in James Street and plaques moulded in brass in the pattern of the originals and set in small concrete cairns honour 29 Yeppoon residents. The Ulam marble Yeppoon Honour Board, financed by public subscription and listing 68 townsmen enlisted in World War One, was originally housed in a glass-fronted case in the Yeppoon railway station. This marble tablet was incorporated into the 1952 obelisk placed in Beaman Park as the Yeppoon War Memorial. A marble plaque reading \\"Lest we forget\\" inserted above the original inscriptions, was a gift from local businessman, B.C. Kent. Plaques commemorating the enlisted for World War 2, Korea and Vietnam have also been added to the obelisk.  Description  The Yeppoon War Memorial is situated over three streets and a park in Yeppoon, all located in the central section of the town. The beach foreshore and esplanade, Anzac Parade has a row of mature hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii) evenly spaced by approximately two metres. This row extends around the corner into Normanby Street, with four mature hoop pines centre planted into a specially created tree reserve. The avenue continues in Normanby Street between Mary Street and Arthur Street planted in the roadside reserve. A row of Coconut Palm Trees is centre planted in James Street under which small concrete cairns are located. Each cairn carries two brass plaques commemorating an individual serviceman. Two original plaques remain in situ, on a short timber pickets. The monumental style War memorial is located in Beaman Park. A simple white concrete obelisk is located in the centre of a double stepped base that has polished concrete horizontal surfaces and white vertical surfaces. The obelisk has marble tablets inset into each face of the obelisk, representing the four conflicts in which Yeppoon residents enlisted. The obelisk culminates in a pyramidal apex.  Heritage listing  Yeppoon War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 July 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War Memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. They manifest a unique documentary record and are demonstrative of popular taste in the post war periods. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Avenues of trees were uncommon in Queensland, a form of memorial favoured by the southern states and in particular rural Victoria. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The memorial at Yeppoon demonstrates the principal characteristics of a commemorative form erected as an enduring record of this community's contribution to events of national significance. In Yeppoon, this is achieved through a combination of avenues of trees, the renaming of Anzac Parade, plaques to individuals sacrificed in war and a symbolic monument dedicated to all who enlisted in the Australian armed forces. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Yeppoon War Memorials are an important aesthetic element in the townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The range and extent of memorial selected by this small community demonstrates the enormous impact that war had and the importance of the commemorative process. The mature hoop pines on Anzac Parade and Normanby Streets have landmark qualities for the township of Yeppoon.

On that mission, Levin became the first American to blow up a Japanese warship. During his subsequent 60 combat missions, Levin also sank an enemy ship during the Battle of the Coral Sea. A year later, although he was off duty, he volunteered to be the spotter and bombardier for a combat mission near New Guinea. During its return, the B-17 ran low on fuel and made a forced landing into stormy seas. Levin remained in the plane and released the life raft which saved the lives of the three other crew members. In doing so, however, Levin was injured and died when the plane sank. Levin won the distinguished flying cross for bombing the IJN light cruiser Natori, the silver star for a direct hit on a 15,000 ton Japanese transport, and the oak leaf cluster for gallantry.

It is located on the borders of Counties Longford, Westmeath and Cavan. Lough Kinale forms part of the River Inny. The lake's inflow is from Lough Sheelin and the outflow is to Lough Derravaragh. The neighbouring (but much smaller) Derragh Lough is also connected by a river to Lough Kinale. Geography Lough Kinale measures about long and wide. The majority of the lake is in County Longford. The lake lies about east of Granard. It is situated downstream from Lough Sheelin in the upper part of the catchment area of the River Inny, a main tributary of the River Shannon. A smaller lake, Lough Derragh, is linked to the ouflow of the Inny River and Lough Kinale. It is a very shallow lake, with a maximum depth of around . There are two parts, almost separated by a central swampy area. The margins of the lake have several reed beds, interspersed with calcium-rich marsh dominated by small sedges. The surrounding land has boggy areas, some of which have been converted to coniferous plantations. The water quality is variable, sometimes suffering from run-off of nutrients from agricultural land. At one time the lake was a trout fishery. Natural history Lough Kinale is a noted coarse fishing destination with fish species including pike. Lough Kinale is part of the Lough Kinale and Derragh Lough Special Protected Area (SPA). This is an important site for overwintering wildfowl, especially mute swan, pochard and tufted duck. The Eurasian coot is found here as well as smaller numbers of great crested grebe, little grebe and mallard. The birds fly back and forth between this lake and the much larger Lough Sheelin.

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built from 1889 to 1929. It is also known as Queen Street Community Hall. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2003.  History  The former Yeppoon State School building was constructed in 1889, following the establishment of the Yeppoon Provisional School in 1885. In 1867, residents of Rockhampton signed a petition asking the Surveyor-General to mark out a town at the nearest point on the central Queensland coast where they might be able to enjoy a day at the beach. An area known as Bald Hills (later Yeppoon) was proclaimed a Town Reserve on 30 April 1868. Rockhampton residents also demanded that the government proclaim a second site, Emu Park, around from Rockhampton, as a Town Reserve. It was considered by the residents that it would be necessary to cater for the future needs of the expanding town of Rockhampton. Emu Park was declared a Town Reserve on 9 January 1869. Following its gazettal as a town, Yeppoon remained comparatively unpopular with Rockhampton residents, who preferred Emu Park, consequently, it was pastoralists and selectors who were the first to settle and develop the Yeppoon area. The land in the area was very fertile, with a yearly average rainfall higher that than of either Rockhampton or Emu Park, and by 1878, the immediate Yeppoon hinterland had been largely developed for agriculture, with the surrounding area used for grazing. The beginning of the 1880s brought changes to the district as people began to take more of an interest in the town. Between 1881 and 1884, it was predominantly residents of the area who purchased the remaining 30 town lots. These lots had not sold at the first land sales in 1873. When an additional town area was surveyed in 1881, however, these lots had all sold out by 1885. The first school opened in Yeppoon was a provisional school which opened in 1885 with 25 pupils. At the time, it was necessary to show that there were at least 30 pupils ready to be enrolled before a state school could be provided. By January 1889, enrolments had grown, with 60 children at the school. At this time, a new building was constructed to accommodate the larger number of children. As the first school was a provisional school, the existing building is the first state school in Yeppoon. In January 1884, James Atherton, on behalf of the community requested that the Department of Public Instruction for a teacher to be appointed to teach the Yeppoon children. Along with the request, Atherton offered his house for the purpose. On 7 June 1884, the application to have a provisional school established at Yeppoon was sent to the Department explaining why a school was needed. The current site was chosen (although the area was not set aside as a Reserve for School until March 1888). On 18 June 1884, the Minister for Public Instruction, Sir Samuel Griffiths, approved the application, and finally, on 4 May 1885, Provisional School number 442 opened at Yeppoon. By September 1888, the Yeppoon community again wrote to the Department of Public Instruction, on this occasions requesting an application form for the establishment of a state school. The formal application was sent on 31 October 1888. On 21 March 1889, a tender in the Queensland Government Gazette called for the construction of new state school buildings at Yeppoon. The new school was opened in August the same year. At this time, the old provisional school building was added to the teacher's residence in order to enlarge it. Several extensions and additions to the school were added over the years, including a fifteen foot extension in July 1900 (possibly the extension to the north-east side of the building); other additions in January 1901; repairs in July 1911; commencement of the planting of gardens in April 1917 and new school buildings in 1918. In June 1930, tenders were called for the purchase and removal of the teacher's residence. By July 1929, tenders were invited for the construction of additions to the school, following which, an eastern wing, with two classrooms was opened. On 10 June 1945, a public meeting was held to discuss the urgent need for representations to be made to the Minister for Education requesting that a new school on a new site be provided as both the existing school and site had become overcrowded. It was to take some time before the Department a new school site, and once again, three more classrooms were added to the eastern wing - two in 1950 and one in 1953. Finally, in August 1955, the Department of Education acquired an area of 42 acres in Jeffries Street and the site was set aside as a school reserve. The Queen Street school became the Infants' School consisting of the 1889 building, including offices and staff rooms. The remaining buildings were moved to the Jeffries Street site to form part of the new state school. The site remained the site of the Infants' School until 1971, when it became a Reserve for Recreation Purposes and the school building became a fitness centre. The adjacent land, now a freehold block, remains as offices of the Yeppoon and District Kindergarten Association. In July 1993, the Reserve for Recreation Purposes was rescinded and the site became a Reserve for Local Government Purposes, with a sub- purpose as a local hall. Since that time, the former Yeppoon State School building has been used as a community hall, and continues to be used regularly by various community groups.  Description  The former Yeppoon State School is a single storey timber building clad with weatherboards, set on high timber stumps set into a concrete base. The building has a gabled roof running east- west, clad with asbestos cement sheeting. The building appears to have been extended on the north-east side. This section also has a gable roof clad with asbestos cement sheeting. The building has a centrally located porch, on the southern side, with a gable roof. Timber steps, lead to a concrete landing. The central gable is infilled with timber shingles, below which is a rounded lintel with dentils. The central gable and end gables have plain bargeboards. Similar to the central gable, the end gables at the western and eastern sides of the building are infilled with timber shingles. Timber, louvred ventilation openings are located high in the western and eastern elevations. The building has verandahs to the north and south sides. The southern elevation, the main entrance to the building, has two double timber doors leading to the main internal room. Located above the two doors are timber framed rectangular window openings with each holding three square panes of glass. The front (southern) verandah has been enclosed on the western side with two, two-pane early casement windows still in-situ. The verandah has timber balustrading with timber posts and heavy, curved timber brackets. The western elevation has a large feature window with eight rectangular timber framed openings, divided into three levels by different types of windows. The bottom level has casements; the second level has pivoting windows and the top level has fixed windows which slope in an easterly direction toward the main room of the building. At the top of the windows, between them and on the outer wall is a panel of mesh. The window is surmounted by a timber framed hood clad with corrugated iron. The rear (northern) verandah has been enclosed with weatherboards and louvres at the eastern end and with vertically joined timbers on the western side. The enclosed area at the western end has early timber framed, sliding glass windows in-situ. Along the eastern elevation, the later gabled extension to the building has two rectangular window openings with each holding three square panes of glass. The window is surmounted by a timber framed window hood. A similar window feature is located along the northern elevation of the later extension. A steel and concrete staircase is located on the northern side of the building leading to concrete stairs, which in turn, lead to the rear of the site and a concrete court area. Internally, the building is composed of one large room which was originally partitioned into two classroom. The room has two circular ceiling vents with lattice covers. Tie-rods run from the northern to southern walls at both the western and eastern ends. The ceiling is lined with timber boards and is level in the centre with the northern and southern sides sloping at an angle to the wall. The walls are also lined with timber boards. Evidence remains of a folding partition across the centre of the building which would have divided the large room into two smaller classrooms. Hinge marks are located on vertical posts on each side along with reinforced brass holes in the floor for bolts. There are hinged flaps in the skirting boards. Some of these have their original hinges and bolts. There are four doors in the building-two on the southern side and two on the northern. The two on the southern side are original double doors, while only the door on the western end of the northern wall is an original double door. The door at the eastern end of the northern wall is a later addition. There are two sets of four pivoting windows on the northern and southern sides. These are placed opposite each other above the doors. There are three mullions in each set of windows and each window has three panes. In each set the windows are paired and attached together with a bar so that opening one opens its partner. Very high up on the walls there are some old hooks which may have been used to hang charts. There are four on the northern wall, one on the west and one on the east. Some of these only retain their base plate and the hook has been broken off. Toilets, constructed of besser block, are located in the central western side of the undercroft area. The north-eastern corner of the undercroft has also been enclosed with timber flooring and a timber frame clad with corrugated iron. The site on which the hall is located slopes in a northerly direction away from Queen Street, with Queen Street sloping from east to west. The grounds are uneven with rocky outcrops and roughly grassed with remnant original plantings. Terraces have been constructed with dry-stone rubble walls. Mature plantings on the site include two large, frangipani trees as well as shrubs such as loquats. A stone retaining wall has also been constructed on the southern side of the site with timber balustrading running east-west indicating the extent of the wall. A picket fence is located at the front of the building along the Queen Street frontage.  Heritage listing  The former Yeppoon State School building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed in 1889, the former Yeppoon State School is significant as the first state school established in Yeppoon, following the establishment of the provisional school in 1885. The former school building provides evidence of the growth of the Yeppoon and surrounding area during the 1880s due to the increasing attraction of coastal living. The former Yeppoon State School is further significant providing evidence of the development of the education system throughout Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Largely intact, the former Yeppoon State School is significant as an example of a building type developed by the Department of Public Works for the Department of Public Instruction. The former Yeppoon State School building demonstrates the principal characteristics of a building of its type by its form and use of materials, reflecting the ways in which architects of the Works Department have addressed problems of light and ventilation in response to climatic conditions, particularly the use of large feature windows and hinged skirting boards to allow for cross ventilation. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Its simple form and materials contribute to the aesthetic significance of the place and the contribution of the building to the Queen Street streetscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The former Yeppoon State School is important for its connection with the community in and around Yeppoon as a provider of public education for several generations. The former Yeppoon State School is further significant for its later use as community hall.

These are used for harbor patrol and other close inshore work, and have often been carried by larger warships as a ship's boat. They range in size between 30 and 55 feet. Patrol boats, or any craft engaged in sentinel duty, are sometimes referred to as picket boats, using \\"picket\\" in the generic sense, even if much larger than actual picket boats. United States The Union's long steam-powered Picket Boat Number One sank the Confederate ironclad Albemarle in 1864. (Although named \\"Picket Boat\\", this craft has also been called a steam launch). The boat was armed with a 12-pounder Dahlgren gun and a spar torpedo, of which the latter was employed in sinking Albemarle. The Union's Potomac Flotilla also employed some picket boats. A number of American warships of the 19th century carried picket boats, such as the (her picket boat was heavily engaged by Spanish small-caliber shore fire during one incident in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War), and others. In the early 1920s, during Prohibition, the United States Coast Guard built a fleet of picket boats to intercept rum runners, supplementing the larger and more seaworthy cutters and patrol boats. These boats were about long, had no main fixed armament, and cost about (about $ in dollars) to build. A later picket boat, built between 1932 and 1943, was long and also had no large main armament. Britain A British picket boat, returning to its mothership (HMS Triumph) after participating in action on April 18, 1915 A long-serving 19th- century British picket boat, carried on capital ships, was a model introduced in 1867 which saw wide service in World War I and even some limited service in World War II. The typical main armament during most of this boat's service life was a Hotchkiss 3‚Äìpounder, adopted by the Royal Navy in 1886. British pre-dreadnoughts, including and , carried picket boats. The P1000 Class Picket Boat is a current British Royal Navy boat, in length, formerly carried on destroyers but now used only for training. Germany The K√∂nigsberg‚Äìclass cruisers of 1905 and 1915 carried a picket boat; the K√∂nigsbergs of 1927 carried two. The Dresden class of a similar era carried one, as did the Wiesbaden‚Äìclass.

Background After Su Shi was arrested for his poetry satirizing policies of the Song court, known as the Crow Terrace Poetry Trial, he was demoted to serve as the deputy of the regiment () of Huangzhou. Synopsis The author and his friends took a boat trip by the Red Cliffs. He sang a song, and one of his friends accompanied him with a xiao, a traditional Chinese flute. The tune was sad, so the author asked why. The guest said that the place reminded him of Cao Cao, who had been a hero of an era, but was no longer there. This made him realize the insignificance of human beings in comparison to the river and universe. Su Shi, however, considered the matter from a relativism aspect that both an individual and nature can be constantly changeable or immortal. He also pointed out that everything has its own owner, so one should not take what does not belong to him/her, except those eternal treasures of the creator like the moon or wind which everyone can enjoy.

The first paper print in English was in Kings 2015 short story collection, The Bazaar of Bad Dreams.  Plot  Attorney Leonard Bradley visits his client, George Hallas, in prison. Hallas has been sentenced to death by lethal injection for the murder of a young boy. He will be executed in less than a week, despite Bradley‚Äôs attempts to prevent it. Hallas has never explained why he committed this brutal act. Now he feels like talking about what he calls ‚Äúthe bad little kid‚Äù: a six- or seven-year-old boy with orange hair, green eyes, and a beanie, who made Hallas's life a living hell for years. Hallas‚Äôs mother died during childbirth, so he was raised by his father and the housekeeper, Mama Nonie. His first encounter with the \\"Bad Little Kid\\" was in 1977. Hallas was good friends with a slightly older and mentally challenged girl named Marlee. One day, the orange-haired boy appeared and terrorized Marlee, causing her to be struck by a motor vehicle. Years later, when Hallas was having a relationship with a woman named Vicky, the kid appeared again, still the same age as he was back in 1977. His bullying drove Vicky to suicide. Three years after Hallas married Carla Winston, the kid caused a gas explosion in a mine that killed Hallas‚Äôs father. He made a series of harassing phone calls to Mama Nonie, who cancelled phone service; she was unable to call for help when she suffered a heart attack. After many attempts to get pregnant, Carla and Hallas were expecting their first child; the Bad Little Kid caused an accident and Carla miscarried. Hallas decided to set a trap for the boy. He became an active volunteer for the local church helping troubled boys. The kid showed up again after Hallas successfully helped one boy get desperately needed eye surgery. Hallas was prepared for him and killed the kid in front of dozens of witnesses. Hallas finishes his story with a warning to Bradley that the monstrous kid might come back. After Hallas' execution, Bradley finds a beanie in his car with two notes attached: one says ‚ÄúSee you soon‚Äù.

Kim studied at Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and received her B.F.A. in printmaking in 2003. She moved to San Francisco the same year of her graduation in 2003, living initially in the Tenderloin neighborhood. Kim later attended California State University, Monterey Bay to study scientific illustration, graduating in 2010. In 2012, Kim started the process of creating the Migrating Mural, a series of six murals featuring Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. The murals span 120 miles of California‚Äôs Highway 395. Fundraising for the project took place on the crowd funding platform, Kickstarter. Kim was a featured artist in the Facebook Artist Residency program. Her work is located in a Facebook campus stairwell featuring graphic portraits of local, native birds and a second mural with illustrations of the local Facebook campus foxes. In 2015, Kim completed a 70-foot by 40-foot mural called the Wall of Birds at Cornell University's Lab of Ornithology. The mural depicts 243 modern bird families, all life size and superimposed on a map of the earth. It took her two and a half years to complete the work. In 2016, Kim served as an artist-in-residency at the De Young (museum) and explored the idea of native and non-native ecology in San Francisco. In 2017, Kim painted the Flora From Fauna series of six murals around Redwood City, California to commemorate a lost industry of the 1920s when Japanese immigrants were growing and exporting chrysanthemums from the city.

Early life Jim√©nez was born on July 3, 1947, in Gato, a barrio of Orocovis, Puerto Rico. He is the fourth of fifteen children of Juan Jim√©nez and Fel√≠cita Hern√°ndez. His father, a tireless farmer, taught him to love the earth and the cultivated soil passionately. Early on, his mother stirred an interest in singing, particularly by taking him to ceremonies where folk music, like the \\"seis chorreao\\" and \\"aguinaldos,\\" was interpreted. A desire for a better career opportunities led him to emigrate to New York City where he was drafted into the army.

She lives and works in Seoul and New York. Biography Rhii was born in Seoul, South Korea in 1971. She received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1995 from Ewha Womans University in Korea. In 1997, she received her Master of Fine Arts from University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. In 2000, she received her Master of Arts from the Chelsea College of Arts in London. In 2014, she was artist in residency at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam. Career Rhii has engaged in different exhibition activities since the 1990s. She introduced her work mainly in the form of books produced for about 5 years from 1998 onwards. In these publications, the environment of the birth of physical work was recorded and documented together with the gradual flow of time around them and the changes that subsequently occurred.

Her interest in encountering otherness originates from the experience of living abroad in many different cultures and the challenges and discoveries that brings. She often works with ephemeral objects, temporary materials and simple, fast drawings that reflect the insecurity, resentment, deficiency and vulnerability of individual physical existence and the inevitable battles with time and space. She often uses an indefinite or not quite finished installation method that expresses hesitation and the dependency of her work on the situation. Her recent works are characterised by underlying and often undisclosed stories or experiences that serve as the inspiration for installations, video and site specific works. Most of these latest works focus on the qualities of her unique relationships with people and places that drift in and out of her artistic life, sometimes seeming to share fate for a period, sometimes just briefly touching the artist's continuing existence.

A three-storey building was put up by the BEG with the expertise of Central Building Research Institute within a span of three months. The students continued to stay in William's bungalow till 1967, after which they were shifted to the 1st floor of one of the wings of the school building. The hostel was closed down in 1973 due to shortage of accommodation as the size of the school had increased considerably. Till 1975 school consisted of classes IV to IX. After 1975 classes X, XI and XII were introduced. In the 1978‚Äì79 academic year, primary classes of LKG and UKG were added.

It belongs to the subfamily Detarioideae. It occurs in Southern Africa. The genus was named for Richard van der Schot by Jacquin who was the director of the Imperial Gardens at Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, Vienna. Van der Schot was his head gardener.  Description and Ecology  The tree is small in stature (max. height 5 m), evergreen, with rigid branches and has a gnarled trunk. The flowers are numerous, bright red to pink in colour and are borne in small clusters during the months of February to March. They are distributed throughout the tree. Flowers produce copious amounts of nectar which attract birds, especially the Lesser Double-collared Sunbird and Malachite Sunbird. The butterfly Dantalis breeds in the tree. Flowers are followed by attractive, large, lime green to pink seedpods which turn brown when ripe. The seed is dispersed through an explosive seedpod, which when dry, catapults the seeds great distances from the parent plant. Seeds are produced in May and June of each year. Under normal circumstancesmstances the seeds would germinate in moist soil in late spring after the winter rains.  Distribution  The tree occurs in South Africa along the banks of dry streams and small rivers in the Little Karoo, the drier areas of Eastern Cape and the southern part of Western Cape.

After recording their first single as the Intruders, they changed their name to Quinstrels, recording one single under that moniker, but later settling upon the name for which they are best known, the Dearly Beloved. Along with the Grodes, they became one of the top groups in the Tucson area, scoring a #1 hit in there, and were on the cusp of breaking to a wider national audience, even briefly recording with Columbia Records and receiving some airtime on radios stations in other parts of the country, but were unable to maintain the momentum long enough to achieve wider success. Their work is nonetheless highly regarded amongst garage rock and psychedelic enthusiasts. History =Origins= The Dearly Beloved formed in 1963 as the Intruders in Tucson, Arizona, which along with an Air Force base, was also a college town, and had a healthy music scene and nightlife. Their original lineup consisted of Terry Lee and Tom Walker on guitars, Shep Cooke on bass, and Pete Schuyler on drums. They started out playing Ventures-inspired instrumental surf numbers, but following the arrival of the Beatles and the British Invasion, they decided to enlist the services of a vocalist and brought in Larry Cox. After winning a Tucson battle of the bands contest, the Intruders were awarded a recording contract with a small label, Gallantry Records, whose recording studio was located in the owners' living room. Their debut single, \\"Every Time It's You,\\" b/w Let me Stay appeared on the Gallantry label in 1964. By this time the Intruders, along with the Grodes, had become one of Tucson's two most popular local bands. Other popular bands there were the Lewallen Brothers and the Five of Us. They released two singles in 1965 on manager Dan Peters' Moxie label, \\"Then I'd Know\\" with the B-side \\"My Name,\\" then later the fuzz-laden \\"Why Me\\" along with \\"Now She's Gone\\" on the flipside, before the prospect of legal action from another band in Detroit also called the Intruders prompted them to switch their name to the Quinstrels. The group issued their next Moxie single as the Quinstrels in 1966, \\"I've Got a Girl\\" b/w \\"Tell Her,\\" which was record at Audio Sound Recorders studio in Phoenix, before changing their name to the Dearly Beloved, at the urging of local disc jockey Dan Gates at KTKT. =As the Dearly Beloved= Gates also convinced the band to record his own song, \\"Peep Peep Pop Pop,\\" which he had written a few years prior and which the band proceeded to record at Audio Sound. According to Gates: :They hated the song, and maybe still do, but I managed to convince them that, while it may not be a big hit, it would be an excellent showcase to show the group's abilities. With that settled, we all agreed that we needed a better name for the group. I don't remember how many names were suggested, but none seemed to fit. We started looking through magazines and books. After a while, I was looking at a row of hardback books in a bookcase when I spotted a book entitled, Dearly Beloved. The group wasn't crazy about this name either, but they eventually gave in. The song issued along with the flip side \\"Is it Better\\" on the New Mexico- based Boyd label in July 1966. The label accidentally printed \\"the Beloved Ones\\" on the label, but the song became successful, topping Tucson radio play lists throughout the summer of 1966, becoming the best-selling song in Tucson that year, staying at #1 for several weeks on the local charts. Label owner Bobby Boyd approached Columbia Records, who, in a buyout deal, signed them to the prestigious label and re-released \\"Peep Peep Pop Pop\\" in September, and it received some airplay nationwide, managing to bubble just under Billobard's Hot 100. Even a year later, on Dick Clark's \\"Rate a Record\\" segment of American Bandstand, it was chosen over the Count Five's \\"Psychotic Reaction.\\" One factor limiting its success was that Columbia did not print enough copies. The Dearly Beloved played numerous gigs in Tucson and Los Angeles, making appearances at venues on Sunset Strip, such as Gazzari's and the Hullaballoo. Columbia arranged for the group to make an album, so they traveled to Los Angeles to record it, cutting twenty songs over the course of three days. Columbia, disappointed with the result, shelved the project. Only a single, \\"Wait 'Till Mornin',\\" written by Tom Walker, saw official release in September 1966. Sensing that Columbia had no interest in promoting them, the band sued the label be released form their contract, and eventually was let go. In frustration, the band's drummer Pete Schuyler soon resigned, Rick Mellinger switching over form the Grodes to become his replacement. =Tragedy and late period= In 1967 the band traveled back to Los Angeles to open for the Leaves and on the trip, were approached by representatives from White Whale Records, resulting in a contract offer. Lead Singer Larry Cox's wedding was scheduled to take place the next morning in Tucson. At 3:00 a.m. immediately following the show, the band departed for the drive home, taking turns behind the wheel. During the trip, the designated driver fell asleep and the car crashed in Yuma Arizona, killing Cox instantly on July 3, 1967. His death voided the White Whale contract, as terms dictated that the lineup remain exactly as stipulated. Shortly before the incident, Cox had written \\"Merry Go Round,\\" which was coincidentally a song about death. The band was able to secure an arrangement with Split Sound Records. In 1967 the band released the unexpectedly prophetic \\"Merry Go Round,\\" with Jim Perry sitting in on vocals for the deceased for Cox who had taken one final and fateful spin, as the B-side on their next single which featured the psychedelically tinged \\"Flight 13\\" on the A-side sung by Terry Lee. \\"Flight 13\\" become a regional hit. Bassist Shep Cooke quit shortly after that to join Linda Ronstadt's group, the Stone Poneys. After Cooke's departure the band started to unravel at the seams and eventually broke up. =Post-breakup= Since the group‚Äôs demise, Tom Walker and Shep Cooke continued to play music professionally. Walker joined Butterscotch, who later became known as Jon Sorrow and cut a song included on the soundtrack album for the movie Hells Angels '69, and also did work for several months with country act Sunset Limited. Cooke founded the Floating House Band in 1970, and also played on albums with Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, Tom Waits, later playing in a local band called the Seekers, and released two solo albums of his own. He also has played on various artists' records and composed some of the songs on Chuck Wagon and the Wheels' albums, as well as playing in the Floating House Band. Pete Schuyler joined the Marines and has worked in electronics. Rick Mellinger became a repertory therapist, becoming the director of the University of Arizona Medical Center respetory unit, but stayed active in music playing with several bands. Terry Lee became a successful architect in Tucson. Tom Walker died on Friday July 20, 2007. In 2005 the group briefly re-united with some of the members form their 1960s roster. The Dearly Beloved's work is highly regarded by garage rock collectors and enthusiasts. Voxx Records released their collected works on a self-titled LP anthology released in 1985, The Dearly Beloved. Their 1967 song \\"Flight 13\\" was re-issued on the Pebbles Box LP (Ubik Records) and Trash Box CD (Hit Records). The collected works of the Dearly Beloved and the Grodes were released on the 1997 dual anthology, Let's Talk About Girls: Music From Tucson 1964‚Äì1968 put out by Bacchus Archives.

Seyyed Ahmad Adib Pishavari used the term for the first time. The term is used several times in Iranian society, media, and newspapers.  Background  In Persian and many other languages, fox is symbol of sly and cunning character and refers to cunning person who put you in a tricky situation. The term and its anti- British concept is used in anti-British poet for the first time by Seyyed Ahmad Adib Pishavari (1844-1930), philosopher and poet. When Amad was young, his father and relatives were killed in war between British and Afghanistan on 1857-58. He had anti-British feeling and wrote many poems by this sentiment. Pishavari always described United Kingdom by animals as old fox, ominous raven, and venomous viper in his poems. The term of old fox remains from that time. English translation of his poem is: Many an ancient house Was razed after you crept in You seized lands through your fox games You have escaped hundred of traps, like an old fox.  Appellation reasons  There are several historical reasons for Britain appellation as old fox or little Satan by Iran include: direct role in deviating Iranian Constitutional Revolution, 1921 and 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat, subversive movement during Nationalization of Iran's oil industry, removing Revolutionaries persons after 1979 Islamic Revolution, and important role in street riots after 2009 presidential election.  In recent years  In 2011 after initiating nuclear- related sanctions against Iran by London, Iranian supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, called Britain embassy as evil embassy. When Britain embassy reopened in 2015, Iranian media and newspapers declared and reported Return of the Fox. Hemayat daily wrote in its front page \\"The old fox arrived with its lights turned off\\", Resalat newspaper published \\"No-one is happy with the return of the old fox\\", and Kayhan daily wrote \\"In Iran's eyes, Britain is still the 'old fox'\\".

In September 1946 he met Stan Hawthorne for the vacant Northern Area title at Anfield, the fight also an eliminator for the British title, losing a points decision. In October 1947, after Ronnie James had vacated, he met Hawthorne again at Anfield for the British title. This time Thompson dominated the fight, knocking Hawthorne down three times in the second round, and the referee stopped the fight in the third round, making Thompson the new British champion. On his return to Thurnscoe he was greeted by a cheering crowd and a street procession from his house to Hickleton Colliery where he gave a speech to the crowd that had gathered. He became known as 'The Pocket Adonis' due to his impressive physique. In February 1948, Thompson challenged for Roberto Proietti's European title at the Harringay Arena; The fight went the full 15 rounds, with Thompson taking a points decision to become European champion. He defended the title in July against Pierre Montane at White City Stadium, the fight ending in a draw.

Barelli was also the co- founder of the Secular Institute of the Missionaries of the Kingship of Christ. Alongside Father Agostino Gemelli the pair sought to spread the message of the Gospel through their educational facilities and through their congregation that sought also to spread the Franciscan charism. Barelli's cause for sainthood commenced in 1960 when she was accorded the posthumous title Servant of God and advanced on 1 June 2007 when Pope Benedict XVI declared her to be Venerable on the account of her heroic virtue. One miracle is required for her beatification and one such case is at present under investigation. Life Armida Barelli was born into the upper class on 1 December 1882 in Milan to Napoleon Barelli and Savina Candiani; her siblings were brothers Gino and Fausto and sisters Maria, Gemma, and Vittoria. Barelli studied in Milan under the Ursulines and then travelled to Menzingen in Switzerland where she studied in a boarding school under the Franciscan Sisters of the Holy Cross from 1895 to 1900. It was during her time with the Franciscans that she discovered her religious vocation and the Franciscan charism. This linked with her ardent desire to deepen her relationship with God and to devote herself to His work. From 1900 until 1908 she received proposals from her parents to wed but despite this she decided to devote herself to others and in particular wished to cater to the needs of the poor and the orphaned. In 1910 she met Father Agostino Gemelli who guided her towards an active apostolate and introduced her to the fullness of the charism of the Secular Franciscan Order. Barelli became a professed member of the order in 1910. During World War I in 1917 she became a translator of German of articles for the \\"Journal of Philosophy Neoscholasticism\\" that Gemelli had founded that very same year. She came to the attention of the Cardinal Archbishop of Milan Andrea Carlo Ferrari who recognized her for her organizational skills and her moral qualities. She met with Ferrari in a private audience on 17 February 1918 and later that year selected as her motto: \\"I trust You\\" as an expression of trust in God. Barelli later became the Vice President for Social Action of the Milan Committee of Catholic Women and also served as the administrator of the \\"Life and Thought\\" publication. Pope Benedict XV received her in a private audience on 28 September 1918 and appointed her as the President of the National Girls' Youth of Catholic Action and held that post until 1946. It was her original wish to serve in the missions despite the pope's insistence that her mission was in Italy. With Gemelli in 1919 in Assisi she established the Third Order Franciscan Sisters of the Social Kingship of the Sacred Heart. Barelli opened a home for the poor in northern China as well as an institute for religious vocations in 1920 and in 1921 founded the \\"Ring of Resurrection\\" magazine. In November 1921 - at the behest of Benedict XV - she established the \\"Society of Friends of the Catholic University\\". Alongside Gemelli, Ludovico Necchi, Francesco Olgiati and Ernesto Lobardo, she established the Istituto Giuseppe Toniolo di Studi Superiori and it was recognized by the Italian Minister of Education Benedetto Croce on 24 June 1920. Benedict XV approved it around the same time which allowed for it to be inaugurated around the same time. In 1936 she established a girls' college named the Marianum College. Pope Pius XII appointed her in 1946 as the Deputy President of Catholic Action and she held that title until 1949. In 1948 she - alongside Gemelli - renamed their religious congregation with the name of the Secular Institute of the Missionaries of the Kingship of Christ in order to spread the Franciscan charism. That same year, she favored the Christian Democrats in the general election in order to prevent the victory of the Italian Communist Party. In 1949 she began to suffer the effects of a progressive and an incurable disease and on 8 January 1952 suffered paralysis in her right hand. On 15 August 1952 she was visited by Gemelli, only to die mere hours later. She was buried on the following 17 August in Marzio and her remains were transferred to Milan on 8 March 1953. Upon his death in 1959, Gemelli was buried alongside her. Beatification process The diocesan process for the sainthood process commenced under Pope John XXIII on 8 March 1960 and the introduction of the cause in Milan granted her the posthumous title Servant of God; the process concluded in mid-1970 and was validated in Rome on 3 April 1992, several decades after the diocesan process concluded. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints received the Positio from the postulation in order to evaluate her life of heroic virtue and received it in 1993. Barelli was proclaimed to be Venerable on 1 June 2007 after Pope Benedict XVI recognized her model Christian life of heroic virtue. The miracle required for her beatification was investigated and was validated in 2006. The medical board in Rome met on 12 November 2009 and the board requested further material pertaining to the alleged miracle on 20 September 2015. The board must approve it and the theologians must meet to discuss it before it proceeds to the pope for his approval. The postulator assigned to the cause is Silvia M√≥nica Correale.

Williston School is a school in Wilmington, North Carolina. It was first founded in 1866 by the abolitionist American Missionary Association after the Union army occupied the city during the civil war. It was intended for freed slaves and initially had 450 pupils divided into five departments: primary, intermediate, advanced, normal and industrial. As it developed, it became known by a variety of names including Williston Graded School, Williston Primary and Industrial School and Williston High School. The original site was on Seventh Street but in 1915, the institution moved to a new campus on Tenth Street and new buildings were constructed in 1933, 1937 and 1954. The institution was closed as a high school in 1968 as part of desegregation and this caused disturbances resulting in the Wilmington Ten. The remaining school on the site is now Williston Middle School of Math, Science & Technology. History Williston Middle School front entrance in 2016 1952 graduate Meadowlark Lemon, on the deck of deck of the aircraft carrier in 1988. It was based upon a school for freed slaves which had been founded in 1866 and named after Samuel Williston, a Massachusetts button maker and philanthropist. That was on Seventh Street but, in 1915, a new building was constructed on Tenth and Church which opened in 1916 as Williston Industrial School and, in 1923, this became the first accredited high school for blacks in North Carolina. A new building was opened in 1933 and then rebuilt when it was destroyed by fire in 1936. That building was then closed in 1954 after a lawsuit and replaced by another new building on South Tenth Street. The lawsuit had been brought by Dr Hubert A. Eaton, a local civil-rights activist who repeatedly pressed for greater equality of education. At the time, the school was comparatively deprived of resources such as new textbooks but its performance was the best of the black schools in the state. Martin Luther King Jr. was scheduled to speak at the school gymnasium on April 4, 1968. He changed his plans, staying in Tennessee, and was assassinated there that same day. Black high school students protested in Wilmington on the following day, making a march to City Hall. Later that year, desegregation plans for Wilmington were disputed in federal court. The school was closed as a high school as the Board of Education did not want to spend the sums required to improve the school to the standard of white schools nor to send white students there. The black students were moved to the previously all-white high schools of New Hanover and Hoggard, where they complained of inadequate provision. Further protests and disturbances resulted in the notorious case of the Wilmington Ten. Notable alumni 1949 graduate Althea Gibson in 1956 after winning the French Open.

The sport enjoys popularity in countries and areas such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and Japan where civilian ownership of real firearms are either illegal or extremely difficult to obtain, but it is also used by some owners of real firearms as an affordable and easily available training tool. Action air is restricted to handgun, and is not included in the IPSC Tournament structure.  History  Action Air was adopted by IPSC in 2008 at the General Assembly following the IPSC Handgun World Shoot XV in Bali, Indonesia, and the first approved rule book came in 2009. Up until then, the sport had already been exercised in Japan, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan for more than ten years.RedWolf Airsoft - Airsoft Practical Shooting Legitimized by IPSC! (2008-11-21)  Targets  IPSC Target is used. The ranges, paper targets and poppers are scaled down to suit airsoft.

Minor scoring is used, with 5 points for the A zone, 3 points for the C zone and 1 point for the D zone. Metal targets have to be light enough to be knocked over, and are usually made of 3 mm aluminum or 1.7 mm steel. Popper metal targets are calibrated to require a good hit to make them fall.

Philip was a nephew of Judah Moss Solomon (1818‚Äì1880) and closely related to Vaiben Louis Solomon (1853‚Äì1908), Elias Solomon MLA, MHR (1839‚Äì1809) and a number of other Jews prominent in Adelaide and elsewhere in Australia. Around 1888 the family moved to Rushcutters Bay, Sydney, and from around 1892 to 1895 she attended Darlinghurst Superior School, otherwise she received private tuition.Margaret Hinsby, 'Benjamin, Sophia (Zoe) (1882‚Äì1962)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/benjamin-sophia-zoe-5205/text8759, published first in hardcopy 1979, accessed online 29 December 2015. Zoe was a true dwarf. She gained a diploma from the Kindergarten Training College, Roslyn Street, Darlinghurst in 1905, when Frances Newton was still principal, and served for a year at the kindergarten attached to The Infants' Home Child and Family Services, Ashfield, before being appointed director of the Froebel Kindergarten attached to the Training College. She then taught at the Sydney Norland Institute, the newly opened offshoot of Emily Ward's Norland Nursing College, and around 1910 founded the Australian Kindergarten Magazine. She joined the staff of Darlinghurst Superior School in 1912, lecturing in psychology and education. She was appointed vice-principal of the Sydney Kindergarten and Preparatory Teachers' College. She was a disciple of Friedrich Fr√∂bel's theories of early education, which focussed on undirected play and encouraged other kindergartens to introduce periods of free play. In 1912 she gave her views comparing Froebel and Montessori education. In 1924 she established the Free Kindergarten Mothers' Union, and in 1930 founded a holiday home for children of the suburbs to experience a little of country life. In 1916 she delivered a paper on sex education for children, which was well received. In 1937 she resigned from the Teachers' College to concentrate on parental training, and in 1944 published a pamphlet Education for Parenthood, which was reviewed positively. Other publications were Talks to Parents in 1947 and The Schoolchild and his Parents in 1950. She ran classes in parent education with the WEA and gave lectures on child study at Sydney University. She was a regular lecturer for the New Education Fellowship's parent education committee. She wrote articles for women's magazines and frequently gave talks on child psychology on ABC radio.

She showed her best form as a two-year-old in 2007 she won the Listed Saoire Stakes on her debut, finished second in both the Debutante Stakes and the Moyglare Stud Stakes and then recorded her biggest success in the Group One Fillies' Mile. Her subsequent racing career was compromised by injury and she made little impact in two races as a three-year-old. She has had some success as a broodmare in Japan. Background Listen is a bay mare bred in Ireland by the Brittas House Stud. She was from the twentieth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Listen's dam Brigid won one minor race in France as a three-year- old in 1994 before being retired to broodmare duty where she also produced Sequoyah, the dam of Henrythenavigator. Listen entered the ownership of the Coolmore Stud organisation and was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many of the Coolmore racehorses the details of her ownership changed from race to race: she was sometimes listed as being owned by Derrick Smith whilst on other occasions she was described as the property of a partnership involving Smith, Susan Magnier and Michael Tabor. Racing career =2007: two-year-old season= On her racecourse debut, Listen was one of seven fillies to contest the Listed Saoire Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh on 29 June. Ridden by Kieren Fallon she started 7/2 second favourite behind the Jim Bolger-trained Saoirse Abu. After being restrained towards the rear of the field she took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish, went clear of her opponents and won by one and a quarter lengths from Tuscan Evening with Saoirse Abu in fifth. On 12 August at the same track, the filly was moved up in class and distance and started 9/10 favourite for the Group Two Debutante Stakes over seven furlongs. After racing last of the nine runners for most of the way she finished strongly but failed by a neck to overhaul the Dermot Weld-trained Campfire Glow. Despite her defeat in the Debutante, Listen was made odds-on favourite for the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes over the same course and distance on 2 September. She was held up by Fallon before making steady progress in the last quarter mile and finishing second, a length and a half behind the winner Saoirse Abu. On her final appearance of the season, Listen and Saoirse Abu met for the third time when the two fillies were sent to England to contest the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse on 29 September. The French challenger Proviso (winner of the Prix du Calvados) started favourite ahead of Listen and Saoirse Abu, whilst the best-fancied of the four British-trained fillies was the May Hill Stakes runner-up Kotsi. Ridden by Johnny Murtagh, Listen tracked the leaders before taking the lead a furlong out and won by a length from Proviso with Saoirse Abu two and a half lengths back in third place. The racecourse stewards held an inquiry into what was described as \\"a prolonged and unattractive wrestle\\" between Murtagh and Proviso's jockey St√©phane Pasquier as the riders battled for position in the early stages of the race, but allowed the result to stand. After the race Listen was made favourite for the following year's Epsom Oaks and was described by Murtagh as being potentially \\"the next Peeping Fawn\\". O'Brien commented \\"She's a brave filly, and when the gap appeared she put her head down and battled for it. That's the hallmark of a good filly. I think she's exciting\\". =2008: three-year-old season= Listen missed most of her second season after sustaining a training injury in April. She reappeared after an absence of over eleven months in the Group One Matron Stakes over one mile at Leopardstown Racecourse on 7 September. Ridden by Colm O'Donoghue she was restrained at the rear of the ten runner field before making some progress in the straight and finishing fifth, two and a quarter lengths behind the winner Lush Lashes. On 4 October she was sent to England for the Sun Chariot Stakes and started 5/1 second favourite behind the French-trained Darjina. She was never in contention at any stage and finished last of the ten runners behind Halfway to Heaven. Breeding record Listen was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Coolmore before being exported to Northern Farm in Japan. She has produced eight named foals and six winners: *Though, a bay filly, foaled in 2010, sired by Dansili. Failed to win in four races. *Ascolti, dark bay or brown filly, 2011, by Danehill Dancer.

It was situated between the Sanctuary of Athena Pronaia and the fountain Castalia. Some remains of archaic buildings, discovered under the xystus, were possibly related to a sanctuary dedicated to Demeter and indicate the sanctity of the area from earlier times. Description The Gymnasium of Delphi was situated between the Sanctuary of Athena Pronaia and the fountain Castalia. Until the beginning of the excavations the Gymnasium was covered by the monastery of the Dormition of Mary, known also as ‚ÄúPanagia‚Äù. The wall- paintings of the monastery were detached before its demolition and are nowadays exhibited in the Byzantine and Christian Museum in Athens. The Gymnasium consisted of two main building complexes arrayed along two terraces. One comprised the xystus and the ‚Äúparadromis‚Äù, i.e. an auxiliary corridor used by the runners, and the other the palaestra with all its annexes, such as the changing rooms and the baths. The xystos The xystos was a covered portico measuring about . The portico was initially formed by a Doric colonnade made of poros stone, dated to the 4th century and consisting of 83 columns. In the Roman period this colonnade was replaced by an Ionic one made of marble but with the same number of columns. The floor of the xystus was covered with sand for facilitating the athletes. The palaestra On the lower terrace was situated the palaestra, comprising a square central court of the \\"impluvium\\" type, surrounded by porticoes divided in rooms. There were two entrances from the southeast and from the north. The inscriptions inform us on the usage of these rooms as pool room, changing rooms, fighting room and platform. To the west of the palaestra there is still visible today a round pool of a diameter and a depth of . Castalia provided water to this basin which, in its turn, distributed water to ten stone bathing basins. In the Roman period a bath with hot water was built also close to the Gymnasium, thus offering an extra luxury to the athletes. The Gymnasium was first built at around 330 B.C., whereas additions and restoration works took place in various phases throughout its history. Many of the travelers who visited Delphi throughout the Ottoman period used to stay at the monastery of Panagia and carved their names on some fallen columns of the Gymnasium which lay in situ; these signatures and marks, notably the one by Lord Byron, can be seen today on the restored columns.

This part of the city is known as \\"Punta Pel√≠canos\\" (\\"Pelican Promontory\\") because just off the coast there is a small island inhabited by pelicans. Fort Lambert no longer has an operational role militarily, but it is a popular tourist destination because of the views it provides across the Bay of Coquimbo. History The first fortification on the promontory was constructed in 1865 when two small cannon were set up on the \\"Castillo del Carmen\\" hill in order to defend the Bay of Coquimbo during the war with Spain. The cannon were later withdrawn on the orders of the mayor. A new fortress was constructed in the same place by the entrepreneur in order to protect the port of Coquimbo from possible attacks by Peruvian ships during the War of the Pacific. A 150-pound muzzle loading cannon from the British Armstrong munitions company was installed on 10 July 1879 by soldiers of the Municipal Artillery Brigade under the command of Engineer on the fortifications constructed by Delmiro Koch. For more than a century the fort was maintained in its original state, with the cannon positioned at its center, but by 2005 there had nevertheless been significant structural deterioration. In 2003 the municipality launched a rescue plan which involved investing 68 Million Pesos. The structure was both restored and expanded, with the addition of three additional stone-built low lookout towers with lighting and benches. Along the approach road, approximately 100 meters to the south of the fort, a stone entrance portal was also constructed, using local stones, and the access path was paved. The restored Fort Lambert was officially inaugurated in 2005. Still visible close by are the remains of a building that at one time served as a women's prison, before being converted for use as a school and, more recently, used by the Chilean navy.

Between 29 September and 11 November 1918, the Allied Army of the Orient liberated these three countries from occupation by the Central Powers.  Background  After remarkable defensive success against Austria-Hungary in 1914, Serbia was quickly defeated by combined Central Powers forces after Bulgaria declared war in October 1915. Remnants of the Serbian army retreated to the Italian-occupied Albanian ports of Durazzo and Valona where Entente naval forces performed a sea evacuation, initially mainly to the Greek Ionian island of Corfu. Also in October 1915, advance elements of a French and British expeditionary force arrived by sea at Salonika in Greek Macedonia. Thus neutral Greece found itself increasingly drawn into the war. Pursuing the retreating Serbs, the Central Powers also occupied Albania, while defeat of Montenegro followed in January 1916. The Central Powers thus occupied Serbia, Montenegro, and most of Albania including Durazzo, while the Entente retained Valona and occupied a portion of northern Greece, establishing the Macedonian front at Salonika to stimulate active Greek participation, to provide a place to redeploy and supply a re-organized and re-equipped Serbian army, and to fight the Central Powers in the Balkans. Entente offensives on the Macedonian Front were ineffective until September 1918, when the Vardar Offensive abruptly overcame Bulgarian and Central Powers defenses beginning with the Battle of Dobro Pole on 15 September. In late September, mutiny struck the Bulgarian army, whose will to fight was exhausted. Entente forces advanced quickly into Vardar Macedonia. On 29 September, Serbian and French forces liberated Skopje, then known as Uskub, as Bulgaria capitulated.A. Palmer, The Gardeners of Salonika, The Macedonian Campaign 1915‚Äì1918 (1965) The Bulgarian armistice allowed the Entente unopposed access to Bulgarian railways and required Bulgaria to expel other Central Powers forces. This drove a decisive Central Powers collapse on all fronts and an unexpectedly quick end to the wider war. Greatly outnumbered and exposed, German and Austro-Hungarian forces in the Balkans, including the 11th Army in Serbia, the XIX Corps in Albania, and small units supporting Bulgaria, fled northward toward Hungary in defeat or forced withdrawal. With no Central Powers forces remaining between Greek and British forces and Constantinople, the Ottoman Empire concluded an armistice on 30 October. Liberation of Belgrade on 1 November, threatening almost unopposed Serbian and French invasion of Hungary, combined with domestic ethnic revolts and growing military mutiny, helped force Austria-Hungary to an armistice on 3 November. On 10 November, Romania repudiated the Treaty of Bucharest and re-entered the war. Alone and facing imminent, certain defeat, Germany agreed to armistice on 11 November.  Liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro  The Allied forces advanced in four directions. In the center, the 1st Serbian Army under Petar Bojovic and part of the French Arm√©e d'Orient under Paul Prosper Henrys advanced north. German forces failed to regroup and block this advance at Ni≈°. Vranje was liberated on 5 October, Ni≈° on 11 October and Belgrade on 1 November. Here, the Serbian Army halted, as the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, or Yugoslavia, was proclaimed on 29 October 1918 amid the imminent collapse of Austria-Hungary. The 2nd Serbian Army under Stepa Stepanovic, with French forces, advanced northwest towards Kosovo. Pristina was liberated by the 11th French Colonial Division on 10 October, and Peƒá on 17 October. By 3 November, the border with Bosnia-Hercegovina was reached. Colonel Dragutin Milutinoviƒá led a Serbian force, the \\"Scutari Troops\\" (later \\"Adriatic Troops\\"), northwest through Albania aiming to liberate Montenegro. This force arrived in Podgorica on 31 October to find Montenegro already liberated by local paramilitary forces. After a last skirmish, the Austro-Hungarian occupation force evacuated Montenegro on November 4. Liberation of Albania (1918) In Albania, the Austro-Hungarian XIX Corps under Karl von Pflanzer- Baltin withdrew by land to avoid encirclement. The Entente had firm control of the Adriatic Sea, as shown by the Allied bombing of Durr√´s on 2 October. The Italian 16th Army corps (CSIO) and the French 57th division advanced northward, liberating Berat on 1 October, Durr√´s on 16 October, and Shkod√´r on 30 October. From the east the French 11th Colonial Division, 30th Division, Italian 35th Division and Greek 3rd and 4th Divisions entered Albania, liberating Elbasan on 8 October. Having reached Kotor, Austro-Hungarian forces surrendered on 3 November.  Actions in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey  After the capitulation of Bulgaria, three French, one Greek and one British division, the 26th, together called the Army of the Danube under of Henri Mathias Berthelot, traveled unopposed under armistice terms through Bulgaria by rail towards Romania. By the end of October, they had reached Ruse, Pleven and Veliko Tarnovo. Their advance motivated Romania to reenter the war on 10 November, as this army crossed the Danube at Svishtov and Nikopol.G√©n√©ral Bernachot, Les Arm√©es fran√ßaises en Orient apr√®s l'armistice de 1918, Imprimerie nationale, 1970, volume 2.L'Arm√©e du Danube, l'Arm√©e fran√ßaise d'Orient (28 octobre 1918 - 25 janvier 1920). When the Bulgarians exited the war, there were no Central Powers forces left to block an Entente advance to Istanbul. Entente forces reached Makri, 30 km from the Turkish border, on 28 October. The Ottoman Empire capitulated two days later.  Aftermath  With the collapse of Bulgaria, Turkey and Austria-Hungary, rivalries among Entente allies emerged. Italy and Serbia clashed over influence in Albania and over the Adriatic Question. In Montenegro a civil war erupted between supporters of confederation with Serbia supported by Italy (Greens) and supporters of a full union with Serbia (Whites). Serbia and Romania disputed the Banat region, which led France to deploy peacekeepers to Banat until borders were fixed on 10 September 1919 in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
