Besides military endeavours, mainly reconquista (the re-conquest of Islamic territory), his episcopate was taken up with the repoblaci√≥n (re-settlement) of the Pened√®s in the south of the diocese, on the frontier with al-Andalus.Adam J. Kosto (2001), Making Agreements in Medieval Catalonia: Power, Order, and the Written Word, 1000‚Äì1200 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 178‚Äì82. In 997 Aeci, as bishop, received a conditional gift from one Sendred Don√∫s of land at La Boadella and a garden in the burgus (suburbs) of Barcelona. Among Sendred's several stipulations for the bishop was that the sacriscrinius (churchwarden) Bonfill and his successors should not be removed from that post. In the church's cartulary, the Libri antiquitatum, the scribe has called this document a conveniencia (agreement), the earliest use of that spelling, which has persisted in modern Spanish.Kosto, 42. Between 1000 and 1002, and again in 1003, the Muslims destroyed the fortified tower (turris) of La Granada, a possession of the see of Barcelona. Twice, in 1005 and 1009, Aeci sold or exchanged ecclesiastical estates in an effort to raise the funds to rebuild it. In 1002 Aeci sent letters to the Roman curia complaining that a certain nobleman named Geribert had seized the castle of Ribes, which rightfully belonged to the bishops of Barcelona. The Papal court responded by sending letters, of apparently no effect, ordering Geribert to hand it back. He was still holding it at the time of his own death, four years after the bishop's, in 1014. In 1005 Aeci was fortunate enough to gain the castle of Barber√†, donated by testament to the see. On 9 March 1009 Aeci founded the pia almoina or casa de la canonja of Barcelona, an \\"almshouse established at the cathedral church and administered typically by the bishop and chapter\\".James William Brodman (1998), Charity and Welfare: Hospitals and the Poor in Medieval Catalonia (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press), 8‚Äì9. An earlier piece of property which had been donated \\"to the cathedral, the poor, and pilgrims\\" by Bishop Vives was devastated by the sack of Barcelona by Almanzor in 985, but in 1009 Aeci donated an estate of his own for the same purpose (\\"to feed the canons and the poor\\") and gave it to the restored canonry. There was at that time no \\"clear distinction between voluntary and involuntary poverty\\". Along with his fellow bishops Od√≥ of Girona and Arnulf of Vic, Aeci took part in the razzia led on C√≥rdoba by Ramon Borrell, Count of Barcelona, and Ermengol I, Count of Urgell, in 1010 and died on the battlefield along with Ermengol.As recorded in the Gesta comitum Barcinonensium, viii, pp. 11, 29 and 124 in L.

It is one of the fortifications built by Germany at the end of the 19th century to defend Strasbourg. It was the first new fortification built in what was then German territory after the invention of high explosives, which rendered earlier masonry fortifications obsolete. Concept Fort de Mutzig was part of a network of forts surrounding Strasbourg and Metz that had been built by the Germans after the end of the Franco-Prussian War. Earlier forts built from 1872 to 1880 used masonry, which did not resist high explosives, or concrete. The Mutzig works were planned as a demonstration of new technology. The western fort, built in 1895, was built of concrete from the beginning, while the 1893 eastern fort, which had been built in masonry, was reinforced and covered in concrete. Armored observation points and 150mm howitzer turrets were installed, while Mutzig was the first German fort with its own electricity generating plant. It also was equipped with a radio link to Strasbourg, infantry shelters and underground living quarters. Costs were estimated at 15 million marks. Description Battery No.1 at Mutzig Tunnel in Fort de Mutzig Franco-German border, 1914 The fortifications comprise three main portions. The newest section, and the place used for tours, is located in the northwestern fort. The 1895 west fort is located somewhat to the south, and the eastern fort about one kilometer to the east of the western fort. Together they comprise a Feste, or fortification, a concept which was later developed in the construction of the French Maginot Line fortifications. In 1914, the fort comprised 50 buildings, with an underground space of approximately 40,000 square meters (400,000 square feet). With 22 turrets equipped with 10 cm and 15 cm howitzers at a maximum rate of fire of 6.5 tons of shells per minute, Mutzig was one of the strongest forts in Europe. 8,000 troops of the German army manned the defenses of Strasbourg at the time. Forces were disposed in the ring of forts around Strasbourg, as well as the Vosges mountains for defense against French forces around Belfort. The fort's armament included: * 8 x 150 mm howitzers in turrets with a range of * 14 x 105 mm guns in turrets, of two models, with a range of up to * 8 x 57 mm guns in mobile turrets * 12 x 53 mm guns in embrasures * 12 armored observation points, two with periscopes, and 7 infantry observation positions Three concrete barracks for the garrison and 18 concrete shelters for infantry were provided, along with four wells, bakeries and other support facilities distributed around the fortification. History The province of Lorraine had been captured during the Franco-Prussian War, prompting an arms race in the form of fixed fortifications on the parts of France and Germany. The fortress saw no significant fighting during the First World War, and was handed over intact to the French Army after the Armistice of 1918, with the exception of about half of its 105 mm guns, salvaged in 1917 by the Germans. The French Army designated Mutzig a rear defense of the Rhine frontier. During the Second World War the fortress was occupied for a time by German artillery and infantry regiments but on June 13, 1940 forces were ordered to evacuate the area and all the guns were decommissioned. Despite this, it was later bombed by the German Luftwaffe when it was suspected that French troops had taken possession. However, part of the Wehrmacht's 215th Infantry Division was in fact in the fortress at the time and more than 70 German soldiers were killed in the Stuka attack. In November 1944 the US Third Infantry Division took the fortress, which was then thinly occupied by German forces who were forced to surrender after a short time for want of ordnance and reinforcements.  The Fortress today  After the Second World War the fortress was used by the French Army for exercises up until the 1960s when it was abandoned but remained in the possession of the military. As the fortress never saw substantial military action, it remains one of the best preserved pre-World War I sites in existence. This enormous site, which retains almost all its original equipment, has been under a process of restoration by a joint German‚ÄìFrench group since 1984 and in 1995 a Museum was opened to the public together with some restored areas of the site. Local historical reenactment groups also make use of the fortress. Since 2014 the fortress has been known by its original name, the Kaiser Wilhelm II fortress.

Madden.Daily Racing Form. January 27, 1920. Sir Martin was a half brother to the first Triple Crown winner Sir Barton, and he raced in the United States, Great Britain and France. Sir Martin was the betting favorite for the 1909 Epsom Derby, but stumbled and threw his jockey at the Tattenham Corner turn, allowing King Edward VII's horse Minoru to win.New York Times. \\"How the race was run.\\" May 27, 1909. Pedigree Sir Martin was sired by the imported British stallion, Ogden, who had been imported as a foal with his dam Oriole to Marcus Daly's Bitteroot Farm in Montana. Ogden was purchased by John Madden in 1901 and stood at Hamburg Place Stud in Lexington, Kentucky. Sir Martin's dam Lady Sterling was a daughter of Hanover and was also the dam of Sir Barton. Sir Martin Pedigree. Sir Martin inherited the deep chestnut coloring of his damsire, Hanover, and had a prominent white blaze on his fore head and one white sock on his left hind foot. Racing in the United States John Madden retained ownership of Sir Martin throughout his two-year-old season in the United States and was also his principal trainer during this time.Kent Hollingsworth. \\"Wizard of the Turf: John E. Madden of Hamburg Place.\\" self-published. 1965. Sir Martin was a promising two-year-old, winning the 1908 Great American Stakes at Gravesend Race Track and the Flatbush Stakes at Sheepshead Bay for Madden. Sir Martin was the top male two-year-old earner of 1908 based on purse winnings of $78,560 and was consequently named as the historical American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 1908. Madden sold Sir Martin at the end of the 1908 racing season for $70,000 to Louis Winans, a Scotsman that Madden had sold several horses to previously and who had interests in European Thoroughbred racing. Racing in the United Kingdom 1909 Epsom Derby Sir Martin found early success overseas during his three-year-old season, winning the Wednesday Welter Handicap held at Newmarket in May 1909 shortly after arriving in Britain. Before the start of the Epsom Derby, Sir Martin was the clear betting favorite, garnering approximately $300,000 in bets from American spectators alone and going off at 3:1 odds. The weather that day was extremely wet, with the race being run in a slight drizzle. Sir Martin quickly moved to overtake the leaders, Brooklands and Louviers, at a perilous turn called Tattenham Corner. As he rounded the turn, he was crowded by the other horses (possibly by Bayardo), crossing his legs, and throwing his jockey Henry \\"Skeets\\" Martin over the rail. Sir Martin was uninjured and continued the race riderless, but he was officially recorded as not finishing. Sir Martin's jockey escaped with a cut forehead from being trampled by the other horses but ultimately survived his injuries. The Americans may have been upset at Sir Martin's defeat, but the ecstatic British crowd soon stormed the track to celebrate the victory of Minoru, the first horse owned by a reigning monarch to win the Epsom Derby. Later career Sir Martin followed the Epsom Derby failure with an unplaced finish in the Royal Hunt Cup at Ascot and a second in the Grand Prix de Deauville in France. He beat Priscillian to win the 1909 Challenge Stakes and won the Durham Stakes, but he finished third in the Cambridgeshire Handicap to complete his three-year-old season. Returning at age four, Sir Martin's biggest victory was in the 1910 Coronation Cup in a field of nine horses, winning in a canter from Bachelor's Double.New York Times. June 3, 1910. Sir Martin did not enter the Ascot Gold Cup or any other races that year possibly due to injury. He was injured soon after a trial run for the City and Suburban Handicap as a five-year-old and was withdrawn from racing for the rest of the season. He did not win a race in 1912 and at age seven won the Ellesmere Handicap in Manchester. Stud career The blood of Hanover Sir Martin was retired from racing in 1913 and his first season as a breeding stallion in the U.K., with Winans retaining ownership, was in 1914 when his services were advertised for the Lordship Stud. Sir Martin was not considered a good sire in England, but his recent status as a \\"half-breed\\" in the British stud book thwarted his chances of breeding with quality mares. The 1914 passage of the Jersey Act was intended to prevent horses with suspect bloodlines (Thoroughbred crosses) from being entered into the British General Stud Book. The Jersey Act was primarily intended to prevent American stallions from becoming prominent studs in England. This was due in part to the pervasiveness of the sire Lexington in American bloodlines, a horse whose female lineage might have not been completely Thoroughbred. While Sir Martin's male line came from certifiable British stock, his female lineage traced to Lexington through his damsire Hanover, thereby excluding him from choice matches. Return to Hamburg Place John Madden repurchased Sir Martin in late 1919 as a replacement for Sir Martin's ailing sire, Ogden. Sir Martin returned to the United States in 1920 and remained at Hamburg Place Stud as a breeding stallion until his death in 1930. In Kent Hollingsworth's biography of John Madden, Madden is described as having a sentimental attachment to the old stallion, considering him to be one of the two (the other being Grey Lag) best horses he ever bred. Madden died in November 1929, but as part of his will, Sir Martin was not sold and was allowed to remain on the farm as a pensioner. Sir Martin is buried in the famous Hamburg Place equine cemetery in Lexington. Progeny While Sir Martin did produce some stakes winners in the United Kingdom and the United States, his contribution to Thoroughbred genetics was neither overwhelming or lasting. He sired 16 stakes winners in America. Most of his notable sons were geldings, with his biggest winners being Spinach (b. 1927), who in 1930, won the Huron Handicap, Potomac Handicap, Havre de Grace Handicap, Latonia Championship Stakes, Riggs Handicap, and in 1935 the Chevy Chase Steeplechase Handicap and $127,320. Also Joy Smoke (b. 1921), who won the 1925 Washington Handicap, Thanksgiving Handicap, National Handicap, Windsor Hotel Cup Handicap and in 1926 the Toronto Cup Handicap, Statler Hotel Handicap and the Century Handicap and $100,045. Sir Martin Progeny His son Healy won the 1928 Champagne Stakes and the 1929 Empire City Derby and Mount Kisco Stakes. Another son called Star Lore (also called Our General) won the 1924 Cowdin Stakes and was himself a sire of a few stakes winners. Sir Martin's European progeny produced stakes winners with his Irish daughter, Martha Snow, producing the 1927 American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly, Nimba, and his daughter Venturesome producing Diapason, a noted long distance runner in Britain.

Completed by 1900 to designs by architect Cass Gilbert, the Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building was the first of several that Gilbert designed in the city. The Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building is designed in the Beaux-Arts style. The building's articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital. Different materials are used in each horizontal section: granite on the base, brick on the shaft, and architectural terracotta on the capital. The Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building's design also incorporates one of Gilbert's trademarks, the extensive use of architectural sculpture on the cornice of the arcade at the top of the building, which includes the heads of lions and women. The building was constructed between 1899 and 1900. Several companies collaborated to create an exhibit about the construction of the building at the Paris Exposition of 1900. The Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building was made a New York City designated landmark in 1992.  Site  The Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building is in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, just northwest of New York City Hall and City Hall Park, and west of the Civic Center. It is situated on the northwest corner of Broadway and Chambers Street. Nearby buildings include 287 Broadway to the north, 280 Broadway to the east, Tower 270 to the south, and the Tweed Courthouse to the southwest. The building spans the addresses 273‚Äì277 Broadway. The lot has dimensions of approximately , with the longer side on Chambers Street. Design The Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building contains 18 stories and two basement levels, and has a roof of . The building was designed by Cass Gilbert and constructed by the George A. Fuller Company in the Beaux-Arts style. Purdy and Henderson were the consulting engineers for the project in general, and Reginald Pelham Bolton was the consulting engineer for the electric work. The National Fire- proofing Company provided the fireproofing materials, while Hecla Iron Works was the ornamental metal supplier. Other contractors included iron and steel supplier Carnegie Steel Company; architectural terracotta supplier Perth Amboy Terra Cotta Company; brick supplier T. B Townsend Brick Company; and granite supplier John Peirce. Additional contractors were hired for the lighting, woodwork, electricity, and plumbing. The Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building was Gilbert's first design in New York City. Gilbert went on to design structures such as the Woolworth Building (the onetime tallest building in the world, three blocks south on Broadway), as well as the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, 90 West Street, and the United States Supreme Court Building. The facade incorporates one of Gilbert's trademarks, the extensive use of architectural sculpture on the cornice of the arcade at the top of the building, which includes the heads of lions and women. Numerous windows were used in the design because almost all of the stories were divided into several small rooms.  Facade  The facade uses different materials for each of its horizontal sections. The three-story base is clad in stone, the eleven- story shaft is of brick, and the four-story capital is decorated with architectural terracotta. All four sides are decorated. The Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building was one of the first structures in New York City to use multicolored glazed terracotta, and the first commercial building in the city to do so. The colored terracotta panels served to highlight the steel superstructure. Communications between Gilbert and Andrews show that Gilbert had initially preferred a single-color scheme for the facade. However, Andrews had convinced Gilbert to add color after they traveled to see the buildings on the Columbia University campus. Detail of the base The lowest two stories of the base are rusticated granite piers topped by Tuscan-style capitals with cartouches, festoons, and plaques. The piers divide the facades into three bays on Broadway and six on Chambers Street. There is a frieze running atop the piers, and the words inscribed on the Broadway size of the frieze. On the 3rd story, the bays are separated by rusticated granite piers topped by festoons, and there are two rectangular windows in each bay. A plain entablature runs above the 3rd floor. The granite used in the base is pale pink, with some traces of purple. The 4th through 14th stories contain a brick facade designed to resemble rustication. Belt courses separate each floor, while there are two windows per bay on each floor, dividing the facade both horizontally and vertically. The bricks are a mixture of deep red and blue hues. The 15th story is treated as a transitional story to the building's \\"capital\\", with terracotta bands below and along the 15th floor. The facades of the 16th through 18th stories are ornamented with terracotta on the Broadway and Chambers Street sides, and consist of plain brick on the north and west sides. The 16th and 17th stories form a loggia, with one arch in each bay; decorative pilasters with red-and-green panels between the arches; and ornamental iron balconies at the 16th floor. The facade of the 18th floor contains one square- headed window in each bay, Hermes heads on the top of each pilaster, and lions' heads at the corners. The building is topped by a copper cornice. The beige terracotta panels contain highlights in red, blue-green, and greenish- yellow hues.  Features  Floor plans During construction, the Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building was bounded by busy streets on the east and south, and existing buildings on the north and west. There was also a sand layer beneath the building. affecting the way that its foundation was constructed. New foundations were installed under the adjacent buildings, without disrupting business in these structures, and the outer walls of the Broadway- Chambers site were shored up. Piles were sunk near the walls of the old buildings and surrounded with timber. Pits were dug at intervals of about , and a heavy post with a timber footing was erected upright in each pit. Sand was removed from inside the pits, around the heavy posts, and underneath the old walls of the site. New brick foundation walls with concrete footings and steel grillages were installed afterward. The building's steel superstructure, covered by walls and fireproofing materials, was designed to resist wind pressures of up to . The floors are made of hollow tile arches, thick, covered with a layer of concrete. The interior partitions are also constructed with hollow tile arches, thick. When completed, the Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building contained Otis hydraulic elevators. The building's plumbing system served 16 communal restrooms, one on each floor above the street, as well as a restroom in the basement and a private restroom for the engineer. As arranged, thirteen of the communal toilets were for men, and three were for women. Building plans indicate that the elevators, as well as a fire stair and the restrooms, are all clustered around a corridor on the north side of the building. A \\"typical floor\\" was outfitted with several offices, connected to each other via doors. On the ground floor was an entrance vestibule from Broadway. The ground-floor space was intended for retail, the basement was to be used for a restaurant, and the subbasement housed the building machinery. History Prior to the Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building's development, its site was developed around 1791 by brewer Anthony Steenbach, who built several one-story buildings on Chambers Street near Broadway. By the early 19th century, the adjoining stretch of Broadway had become developed with commercial shops, such as Alexander Turney Stewart's dry-goods store at nearby 280 Broadway. The adjacent section of Chambers Street had been residential until the mid-19th century, when it became a commercial area. A five-story masonry structure was erected at the Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building's site around 1852. The land was under the possession of the \\"prominent and wealthy\\" Andrews family of Boston by 1896. Family member Edward R. Andrews, acting on behalf of the Sarah A. Andrews estate, was looking to develop the land. Boston lawyer Alexander S. Porter introduced Andrews to Gilbert, a Saint Paul-based architect who had designed the Second Brazer Building in Boston, a project in which Porter had invested. The Brazer had been Gilbert's first skyscraper.  Construction  Top stories Plans for the 18-story skyscraper, designed by Gilbert on behalf of Andrews, were announced in March 1899. George A. Fuller Company received a contract to build the new structure at a projected cost of $700,000. Just before being selected to design Andrews's building, Gilbert had moved his offices to New York City. Work began on May 3, 1899, with the removal of existing structures. That month, the Andrews estate received a mortgage of ¬£144,500 from the Scottish Provident Institution, of Edinburgh. The Real Estate Record and Guide also reported the same month that the Andrews estate had sold the lot to a syndicate composed of Gilbert and the Fuller Company. Excavation took more than months because of the need to underpin surrounding structures. The building's steel columns were in place by October 1, 1899. After the foundation work was completed, the steel structure was constructed to the 2nd floor by October 6, then to the 7th floor by November 9, to the 17th floor by December 7, and to the roof by December 31. The masonry was installed simultaneously, reaching the 12th floor by December 31, 1899, and the cornice by February 1, 1900. Work proceeded in spite of several difficulties, such as the lack of heat in January, as well as the fact that the building's woodwork and rooftop copper had been burned at the wood mill in 1899. Several companies collaborated to create an exhibit about the construction of the building at the Paris Exposition of 1900. For the Paris Exposition, two models were built at 1:24 scale, one in plaster and the other in metal; both models stood about high. Purdy & Hutchinson built the plaster model for $1,000, while H. C. Hincliff built the metal model for $3,000. Gilbert received a medal from the Paris Exposition, addressed solely to \\"Monsieur Broadway-Chambers, Etats-Unis\\".  Use  The building was completed relatively quickly because of the land valuation. The lot was estimated to be worth $1.5 million, and the monthly mortgage payments were estimated at $120,000, with a going interest rate of 4% over 24 months. The first tenants began moving into the building on April 27, 1900, and the building was in full operation four days later, with everything being complete except for some minor finishes. Some of its early tenants included confectioners Manufacturers' Purchasing Corporation, as well as insurance interests such as the People's Security Company and Aetna agent Frank F. Eagles. The building has seen relatively little change over its existence. A copper gutter was originally located above the cornice atop the building, but was removed in 1925. The storefronts were also rearranged: the original arrangement had three storefronts, but this had been changed to four storefronts by the late 20th century. One of the original storefronts, in the westernmost bay on Chambers Street, was turned into a service entrance. In 1992, the Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building became a New York City designated landmark. Critical reception On the building's completion in 1900, architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler said that it was \\"the summation of that type of design of a tall building\\". Architects' and Builders' Magazine characterized the building as \\"represent[ing] the latest ideas in design, the most improved methods of construction, and in its mechanical outfit\\". Architectural writers Sarah Landau and Carl Condit wrote that the Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building was often described as one of New York City's first pure and \\"simplified\\" skyscrapers, although Landau and Condit state that this distinction was actually held by the American Surety Building at 100 Broadway, completed in 1894. Several critics praised specific facets of the design. Schuyler saw the polychrome terracotta as \\"the next advance in the execution of the accepted [tripartite] scheme\\" of building design. Paul Goldberger, writing in The New York Times in 1977, called the Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building \\"a fine eclectic skyscraper with an especially elaborate cornice.\\" In 1998, the Times's Herbert Muschamp wrote that the red brick with blue highlights \\"is especially fine\\", and that \\"In contrast with the light-colored stone and terra cotta, it gives an almost colonial feel to an otherwise classically conceived structure.\\" See also * List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan below 14th Street References Explanatory notes Citations Bibliography  * External links  Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building on Emporis.com Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in New York City Category:Broadway (Manhattan) Category:Cass Gilbert buildings Category:Civic Center, Manhattan Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1900 Category:New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Manhattan Category:Tribeca ","title":"Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building"},{"id":"26130359","text":"Breaker Mountain is a mountain located on the border of Alberta and British Columbia.

He played college football with Army and was selected as a first-team All-American in both 1913 and 1914. He was wounded in battle while serving in France during World War I and later played in the National Football League for the Canton Bulldogs in the 1925 NFL season. He became a soldier of fortune, training Iran's Persian Guard, working with the Chinese Army in the 1930s, and serving in the French Foreign Legion. Biography Athlete at West Point A native of Chicago, Illinois, Merrilat (Merillat) was a cadet at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, from June 1911 to June 1915. While serving as a cadet, Merrilat (Merillat) was an all-around athlete, competing for Army in football, baseball, basketball and track. He gained fame as an end for the Army Black Knights football team and was selected as a first-team All-American in both 1913 and 1914. The passing team of \\"Prichard to Merrilat\\" was one of the first great passing combinations in college football, and Merrilat was noted for playing \\"the western game, something which had not been seen before in the east.\\" Merrilat's teammates on the Army football teams included two of the leading generals of World War II ‚Äì Omar Bradley, who played at the opposite end position from Merrilat, and Dwight Eisenhower, who played halfback until a leg injury sidelined him. In 1913, he helped the Army defeat a Navy team that allowed only seven points in its other games. Army defeated Navy 22 to 9, as Merrilat scored 18 points on two touchdown passes and a 60-yard run. In 1914, Merrilat helped lead Army to an undefeated 9‚Äì0 season. In the final game of the season, Army defeated Navy 20 to 0, as Merillat blocked a punt in the end zone for a safety and scored on a 20-yard touchdown pass. Military service After graduating, Merrilat served in the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant from 1915 to 1916 and a first lieutenant from 1916 to 1917. In May 1917, one month after the entry of the United States into World War I, Merrilat was promoted to the rank of captain of the infantry. He sailed for France with the American Expeditionary Forces in March 1918 and was promoted to the rank of temporary major of the infantry in June 1918. He participated in the Battle of Ch√¢teau-Thierry, Second Battle of the Marne, and Meuse- Argonne Offensive. He was severely wounded by airplane machine gun fire at Avocourt and sailed for the United States on December 24, 1918. Professional football and basketball In 1925, Merrilat played one season of professional football for the Canton Bulldogs in the early days of the National Football League. In 1926, Merrilat and a partner, Jim Kinney, organized a professional basketball team in Canton, Ohio. At the time, Merillat expressed his belief that professional basketball would flourish, telling a reporter for an Ohio newspaper, \\"Professional basketball is attracting the sport fans because it is the best type of basketball they can see ... [A] professional basketball team is made up of the stars from several teams and necessarily must be stronger and better than any amateur team because it is composed of experts.\\" Merrilat opined that his Canton team was \\"one of the strongest in the country.\\" Soldier of fortune Merrilat spent many years as a \\"soldier of fortune.\\" In Iran, he trained the Persian Guard. From Iran, Merrilat traveled to China where he was a general and trained more than 40,000 Chinese troops, \\"the pick of their army.\\" Merrilat developed a reputation as a soldier with \\"no equal as a troop trainer or an army builder.\\" When World War II began, Merrilat reported to the French and served on the Maginot Line. After a few months, he left and became a captain in the French Foreign Legion where he reportedly \\"served with bravery and distinction.\\" World War II When the United States entered the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Merrilat resigned from the French Foreign Legion and enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he was given a position training the troops. Promoted to the rank of colonel, Merrilat was put in charge of the Army's forces at Miami Beach, Florida, during World War II. Ninety hotels in Miami Beach were taken over by the Army during the war, and Merrilat turned over the keys to the final building to Mayor Herbert Frink in June 1946. Family and death In November 1915, Merrilat became the subject of press coverage when he was sued by Helen Van Ness for breach of promise after breaking off an engagement. Merrilat married another woman, Ethel Wynne, in June 1915. Merrilat hired the noted Chicago attorney, Clarence Darrow, to defend him against the charges, which were eventually dismissed.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the- football-star-and-the-wrath-of-his-would-be-bride-3622576/ After a year-long illness, Merrilat died in Chicago in April 1948 at age 55. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He was survived by his widow and two daughters, Mary Lou Choporis and Ethel Merrilat.

The club is currently affiliated with the Loddon Valley Football League.  History  The first mention of football being played in Inglewood is in 1873, when 'the first football match of the season' was played by the Inglewood Cricket and Football Club. The first games were scratch matches between club members. Real interest began to be shown around 1876, when Inglewood played against Wedderburn in a 'grand' football match as part of an Inglewood Hospital fund raiser. Inglewood also played against Serpentine that year, as well as a team of Inglewood 'amateurs' labelling themselves 'the Bothumpians'. In 1877 the club became a foundation member of the Victorian Football Association (VFA). The Melbourne Football Club visited Inglewood in 1877, playing a match against an Inglewood District team. A similar match was played against the Carlton Football Club in 1879. In the 1880s and '90s, Inglewood continued playing against local teams, firstly in a competition called the North West Division, and then the Loddon Association, before becoming a foundation member of the Loddon Valley Football League in 1903, taking out the inaugural premiership. The club then joined the newly formed Korong League in 1908. The club was dominant in the 1920s, playing in 8 grand finals for 5 premierships, under the leadership of Jack Brennan, a former VFL player with South Melbourne. Following Brennan's departure the club sought another high-profile coach, signing Edward 'Carji' Greeves in 1935. Greeves was a premiership player for Geelong and the first winner of the Brownlow Medal for the VFL's Fairest and Best Player. Due to the depression and high travelling costs in 1936, Inglewood formed two teams, the 'Stars' and the 'Rovers', competing against Serpentine and Rheola in the Inglewood Football Association. By 1937, the club was back to one team in the Korong League, returning to the Loddon Valley Football League in 1938. The club was very strong between 1946 and 1958, taking out six premierships in that period. The club's most recent premierships came in 1971 and 1986. The club celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2001 with premiership reunions and the naming of a Team of the Century. After reaching the preliminary final in 2003, the club fell upon hard times, enduring a 51-game losing streak. The drought was finally broken in Round 3, 2007. The fact the club survives today is testament to the hard working committee and loyal playing group that backed the club during that difficult period. 2016 saw the club celebrate 140 Years which included the naming of a netball 'All-Stars' team.https://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/sport/country-football/inglewood- football-club-brings-up-140th/news-story/e2d9c947c813e0f596ba8c54797fcc32  Affiliated Competitions  1877 to 1879 - Victorian Football Association, North West Division 1880 to 1894 - No formal competition 1895 to 1902 - Dunolly Electorate/Loddon Association 1903 to 1907 - Loddon Valley Football League 1908 to 1935 - Korong District Central Association 1936 - Inglewood Football Association 1937 - Korong League 1938 to Present - Loddon Valley Football League  Club Colours  1877 - Blue Jersey, Red Cap, Blue Knicks, Blue and Red Striped Hose 1877 - 1908 - Blue and Red 1909 - 1922 - Blue and White vertical stripes 1923 - 1935 - Dark Blue 1936 - 'Stars' - Light Blue with white 'IFC' monogram, 'Rovers' - Yellow and Black 1937 - 1950 - Light Blue 1951 to 1975 - Royal Blue with White 'V' 1976 to 2013 - Navy Blue with White 'IFC' monogram 2013‚ÄìPresent - Navy Blue with White 'V'  Home Grounds  1876 to 1892 - Inglewood Public Park (current Golf Course) 1893 to 1950 - Inglewood Recreation Reserve ('Old Rec', cnr Heales St and Morrow St) 1951 to Present - Inglewood Community Sports Centre (Grant St)  Premierships  * Dunolly Electorate **1895 * Loddon Valley Football Association ** 1903 * Korong Central District League ** 1908, 1910, 1912, 1923, 1924, 1926, 1928, 1930 * Loddon Valley Football League ** 1946, 1951, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1958, 1971, 1986 Notable players to have played for Inglewood include *Jack Turpie (recruited to Fitzroy for the 1896 season) *Percy Martyn (began career with Inglewood in 1909 and 1910 before joining St Kilda, then Richmond (won the club goal-kicking award in 1913) and Essendon.

She was commissioned on 1 December 1934. She was used extensively during World War II for convoy operations to Greenland and as a part of the Greenland Patrol. Pre-war assignment The cruising cutter Comanche, was the fifth of six \\"165 foot(A)-class\\" cutters that were constructed based on a 1915 Tallapoosa/Ossipee design that included provisions for light ice-breaking and the first class that utilized geared turbine engines. Comanche was capable of breaking up to 2 foot of ice because of a reinforced belt at the waterline. Built by Pusey & Jones Corporation of Wilmington, Delaware, Comanche was commissioned on 1 December 1934 and was originally stationed at Stapleton, New York, which remained her homeport until 1940. She carried out the standard missions of the Coast Guard at that time, including law enforcement, search and rescue, and light ice-breaking on the Hudson River. World War II Comanche made history in 1940 when she transported the first American Consul to Ivigtut, Greenland, on the invitation of the Danish government-in-exile, beginning a close association between Greenland and the Coast Guard during the war. On 1 June 1941 she was assigned to the newly established South Greenland Patrol and was transferred to the Navy on 1 July 1941 where she operated under the control of CINCLANT (DESLANT) [Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, Destroyer Command, Atlantic] and her homeport became Boston. She was used primarily for convoy escort to Greenland waters. On 27 March 1942 Comanche left Boston escorting Lightship No. 110 to Portland, Maine. There she engaged in anti-submarine exercises and on the 29th got underway with the Frederick Lee, escorting lightship No. 110 and the SS Omaha to Argentia, arriving there 4 April 1942. Next day she was escorting Omaha to Greenland, anchoring at Bluie West One. On the 15th she departed for Ivigtut. She remained there until the 28th when she then transported and assisted a survey party of Army personnel in the preliminary survey and selection of a tank-farm site at Ivigtut, also construction site \\"C\\" at Kajartalik. She returned to Bluie West One on 28 April and remained there until 8 May 1942. While there details were arranged for the flight of six PBY's from Argentia to Iceland via Bluie West One, the Comanche taking communication guard of planes in the flight. On 8 May she proceeded to Ivigtut to guard the cryolite mines there, remaining until 20 May 1942. The rest of May, 1942, she was employed in ice-breaking activities in Sondre Stromfjord and then in towing the from Godthaab to Bluie West One. Arriving on the 28th she met the in Tungliarfik Fjord and escorted the transport to Bluie West One, arriving there on 3 May 1942. On 6 June, she patrolled Weather Station \\"A\\" where she remained until 20 June 1942, being relieved by . From 25 June to 2 July she was on airplane guard at the mouth of Tungliarfik Fjord being relieved by the USS Bear. From 4 July to 17 July 1942, she relieved Algonquin on Weather Station \\"A\\" and after repairs to her steering gear she returned to Bluie West One. On 22 July 1942 Captain C. C. von Paulsen, USCG, (Senior Officer Present Afloat, Greenland) and Ensign J. Starr, USCG, came on board Comanche and she proceeded to Julianehaab whence on the 23rd pilots S.T. Sorenson and Julius Carlson came on board to cruise through the inside passage of southern Greenland, taking soundings and making observations of uncharted areas. From 29 July 1942 to 7 August 1942, Comanche met incoming convoys and relieved their escorts. Then she took on fuel and stores for the Ice Cap Station which was to be established on the east coast of Greenland and on the 13th embarked ten Army enlisted personnel and two civilians and their gear, leaving Ivigtut with the to escort Dorchester and SS Alcoa Pilot to Bluie East Two, where she arrived on the 17th. Here she took on more supplies for the Ice Cap Station and proceeding to Angmagssalik, three enlisted Army personnel departed while three Army officers came aboard. She departed on the 18th and proceeded down the east coast to an unnamed bay at 65¬∞ 03' N x 40¬∞ 18' W, which was to be the site of the Ice Cap Station. Arriving on the 18th the bay was named Comanche Bay in honor of the cutter Comanche. Five days were spent unloading supplies and on the 24th she left for Angmagssalik and Bluie East Two to get more supplies for the Ice Cap Station. Returning to Comanche Bay, the cutter took soundings and established two anchorages markers. On 21 September 1942 Comanche completed all operations and left Army personnel and civilians at the station, returning to Bluie East Two. On the 7th she left Bluie East Two, escorting Dorchester to Bluie West One, arriving on the 9th. From 11 September 1942 to 19 October, Comanche was engaged in local escort duty in Greenland, escorting with other Coast Guard vessels, various merchant vessels and Army transports between the bases that had been established on the west coast of Greenland and meeting incoming convoys. Her duties took her to the east coast of Greenland as far as Denmark Straits on 17 October 1942. On 19 October 1942 she left Kungnat Bay with and Algonquin, escorting five freighters to Newfoundland, arriving at Argentia on the 24th. She arrived at St. John's on 3 November 1942, and along with three other escorts left St. John's, escorting five vessels to Greenland. She arrived Bluie West One on 11 November 1942, and on the 13th left Kungnat Bay, escorting eight freighters, two Army transports and Bear to St. John's. On the 19th she proceeded with Algonquin, Bear and to Argentia, arriving on the 20th and leaving same day for Boston where she arrived on 24 November 1942. On 29 January 1943, Comanche was underway with the and , out of St. John's, Newfoundland, escorting convoy SG-19, consisting of Dorchester, SS Biscaya, and SS Lutz for Greenland. During the early morning of 3 February 1943 the German submarine U-223 fired five torpedoes at the convoy. One of the first torpedoes struck and exploded against Dorchester, on her starboard side in the machinery spaces. The escort vessels' first indication of trouble came from the convoy at 0102 on that morning, when a white flash was observed to come from Dorchester, just abaft her smokestack. This flash was followed by a clearly visible cloud of black smoke and the sound of an explosion. There followed immediately two blasts from the whistle of Dorchester and lights were seen to flash on in numerous spots on the ship. At 0104 the officer of the deck of Comanche, which was approximately 2500 yards on the port beam of Dorchester, sounded the general alarm and all stations were manned. At 0112, Comanche, in accordance with pre-arranged instructions, commenced maneuvering to intercept and destroy any enemy submarines in the vicinity. At this time all lights left burning on Dorchester went out and it is believed she sank immediately after this at 0120. At 0226 instructions were received from the escort commander, aboard Tampa, for Comanche to proceed to the scene of the sinking and cooperate with Escanaba in the rescue of survivors. Upon arriving at the scene at 0302 Comanche passed through an oil slick in which numerous red life jacket lights were seen burning, but upon attempting to pick up some of these, it was discovered that the men in the jackets, close aboard, had already perished or had become unconscious and were unable to respond or act in any way. At 0345, forty survivors from a lifeboat were brought aboard Comanche as she screened Escanaba against submarine attack. Altogether Comanche rescued a total of 97 survivors, mostly through utilizing a new rescue technique involving the use of a \\"retriever.\\" This technique involved having a crewman, dressed in a special suit, jump overboard with a line tied around him. The retriever would then grab hold of a survivor and crewmen on board the cutter would then haul both men on deck. With the survivors suffering from hypothermia and therefore unable to climb aboard a rescuing vessel, the retriever method proved to be the only way to save lives. Three officers and nine enlisted men from Comanche acted as retrievers that night. A contemporary report noted: The Escanaba managed to rescue 132 survivors. The rest of the passengers and crew of Dorchester, four officers, 98 crewmen, and 558 passengers (primarily Army personnel as well as 16 Coast Guardsmen), perished. The sinking gained international attention due to the loss of four U.S. Army chaplains who perished after voluntarily giving up their life jackets to other Dorchester survivors. Their courage, calm attitude, and sacrifice were later recognized by Congress. Comanche and Escanaba landed Dorchester survivors at Bluie West One on 14 February 1943. Comanche served as local escort during the rest of February and late in March departed for Boston. During the month of April, Comanche was on availability at the Boston Navy Yard. After twenty days of training exercises at Casco Bay Comanche arrived at Argentia with Tampa and Mojave escorting two tugs towing sections of YD-25. She departed Argentia for Boston on 6 May 1943, escorting three tugs to Boston, stopping for three days in Halifax while one of the tugs was repaired. She then arrived at Boston on the 15th. Departing on the 17th for Casco Bay, Comanche on the 19th began escorting two tugs towing two more sections of YD-25 to Argentia, arriving on the 24th. Proceeding to St. John's on the 25th Comanche escorted two vessels as convoy SG-74 with the and to Greenland on the 27th. She remained at Gronne Dal from the 3rd to the 5th of June, while the convoy unloaded and then proceeded to Narsarssuak, returning to Gronne Dal on 8 June 1943. On the 10th she began escorting two vessels to Bluie West Eight, breaking through heavy ice. She departed Bluie West Eight on 16 June 1943, for Gronne Dal, proceeding with difficulty through the ice, anchoring one day off Godthaab three days at Marrak Point. She escorted two vessels to Narsarassuak on 23 June and anchored with the third at Gronne Dal. Between 24 and 29 June she went to Godthaab bringing back 58 Eskimo dogs and other freight and anchoring at Kungnat Bay on 30 June 1943. On 1 July 1943, Comanche was underway from Gronne Dal with three escorts and a one vessel convoy to St. John's. Comanche proceeded directly to Boston, arriving on 9 July 1943, and remaining there until the 25th, after which she spent five days on training exercises in Casco Bay, returning to Boston on 30 July 1943. Leaving Boston on 1 August 1943, Comanche arrived at St. John's on the 7th and was underway on the 12th screening convoy SG-29 to Kungnat Bay which was reached on the 22nd. On the 24th she was escorting convoy GS-27 to Placentia Harbour, Newfoundland, arriving on the 30th. On 31 August she was again underway escorting a convoy to Sydney, Nova Scotia, and thence to St. John's. After an inspection on 8 September 1943, she began escorting convoy SG-30 with four other escorts to Greenland. En route she depth-charged a sound contact on the 11th, anchoring in Kungnat Bay the same day before proceeding to Gronne Dal. On the 15th, still escorting one section of convoy SG-30, she departed Gronne Dal and reached Ikateq on the 18th. On the 21st she searched Angmagssalik Fjord for a lost ship's motor boat which returned safely later the same day. Another missing motor boat was searched for on the 25th and was picked up by the Bluebird outside Angmagssalik entrance. Comanche remained in Angmagssalik Fjord until 18 October 1943. She then proceeded to Kungnat Bay, escorting three vessels in company with the Northland. On local escort duty until 25 October 1943, Comanche began escorting the 16 ship convoy GS-34 with seven other escorts on that date. Diverted three times by reported submarine action on their charted route, the convoy was sent to Cape Race. On 1 November she departed Argentia as escort for a convoy to Boston. On 14 November she proceeded to screen the USAT Nevada, which had slowed down with engine trouble. She moored at Boston on 5 November 1943, for availability until November 27, 1943. Departing Boston for Argentia on 27 November, she proceeded at best speed to overtake the and , taking position as escort on the 28th, as Modoc dropped hack with boiler trouble. Arriving Argentia on 1 December 1943, she departed on the 6th escorting a British tanker to St. John's where she remained until the 13th. Then she proceeded with Modoc and Tampa to escort the USAT Fairfax as convoy SG-37 sailed to Greenland. On 15 December she detached to investigate a distress message from Nevada in position 56¬∞ 35' N x 49¬∞ 10' W to which position Comanche proceeded at full speed. At 2100 Nevada was sighted through snow squalls, a darkened ship lying low in the water, apparently abandoned. The boat falls were hanging empty and no personnel could be seen aboard. Half an hour later a red flare was sighted and proved to be a lifeboat crowded with 29 men and a dog and they were taken aboard. Unfortunately three of these men were lost when they attempted to jump to Comanche's deck and although the crew made a heroic efforts to save them, none of the three were recovered. The area was then box-searched for other survivors until the 19th, the Comanche being joined in the search by the cutters Storis, Modoc and Tampa. The Nevada sank on the 16th and Comanche reached Bluie West One on the 21st, delivering Fairfax and landing the 29 survivors of Nevada, proceeding to Gronne Dal on December 24, 1943. Departing Gronne Del on 25 December 1943, Comanche with three other escorts began screening convoy GS-39 which moored at St. John's on 1 January 1944. On the 3rd she departed for Boston with three other escorts and the convoyed YD-2, arriving on the 7th. Proceeding then to Casco Bay on the 23rd she remained there through the 29th undergoing intensive drills, returning to Boston until 1 February. On that day she departed with two other escorts for Fairfax reaching Argentia on the 4th and remaining there until the 9th. Then she departed for Halifax escorting SS Pollaland and returned to Argentia on the 13th, departing for St. John's on the 15th. On the 16th she was en route Greenland escorting, with the Northland, the SS Julius Thomsen, to Greenland. She anchored in Kungnat Bay on the 22nd after dropping a nine-charge pattern on a sound contact, bringing up an oil slick and air bubbles, although a search of enemy records after the war did not show any U-boat losses in this area at this time. Proceeding then to Gronne Dal, she remained there until 3 March 1944. During the remainder of March, Comanche broke ice Skov Fjord and engaged in local escort work. On the 14th she departed Gronne Dal to establish Weather Station 'Able' where she remained until relieved by Active on the 24th. Returning to Gronne Dal she remained moored there and at Narsarssauk until 22 April 1944, when she departed with Mohawk, escorting the SS Laramie to Boston. Encountering impassable ice she returned to Gronne Dal again, departing on 24 April for Boston. Comanche arrived Boston 2 May 1944, for a 20-day availability, after which she proceeded to Argentia arriving on the 29th and at Gronne Dal on 3 June 1944. She spent the balance of 1944 on weather patrol on Weather Station 'Charlie' returning to Boston on 6 August 1944, for generator repairs. On returning to Greenland in September, 1944, she acted as escort for convoy SG-52. Again assuming weather patrol duties on Station 'Charlie' during October, November and December except when she went to the assistance, on 23 October 1944, of the German prize Externsteine, which had been captured by and , and acted as screen on 26 October 1944, for Storis, which was towing the disabled Northland. On 8 November she searched for the schooner Effie Morrison without results and also on the 13th for a lost plane, again without results. Comanche was on weather patrol on station 'Able' as 1944 closed. Comanche continued on weather patrol, patrolling Station No. 6, during January and February, 1945, relieved by Algonquin and . In March, 1945, she returned to the United States and after 30 days availability and ten days of training exercises at Casco Bay, arrived at Argentia on 29 May 1945. Here she was assigned to International Ice Patrol duty until 4 June 1945, when the assignment was cancelled. Proceeding to NOB, Iceland on 20 June 1945, she was assigned to Air-Sea Rescue Station at 62¬∞ 45' N x 29¬∞ 00' W on 14 July 1945, returning to Iceland on 20 July 1945. She maintained the station again from 1 to 7 August and again from 16 to 23 August, during which patrol the war ended, and finally from 25 to 28 August 1945. From 9 September 1945 she was on four- hour standby air-sea rescue duty at Reykjav√≠k for the rest of the month. Comanche then prepared for a return to her peacetime duties. Post War Career After her war-time armament was removed, Comanche was transferred to her new homeport of Norfolk, Virginia. During the post-war demobilization mania and the consequent reduction in the number of personnel kept on active duty, there were not enough Coast Guardsmen to man every cutter in the fleet. The Coast Guard then began to determine which cutters would remain operational and which would be placed in reserve status or decommissioned altogether. On 23 April 1946, Comanche was ordered to be placed \\"in commission, in reserve\\" status, with a reduced crew. She was activated for duty for six days in February, 1947, during the ice season, but was then prepared for permanent decommissioning. Comanche was decommissioned on 29 July 1947 and placed in storage at the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland. She was then declared as \\"surplus to the needs of the Coast Guard\\" on 13 July 1948 and sold on 10 November 1948 to the Virginia Pilots Association. In 1984 the cutter was donated by the Virginia Pilot's Association to the Patriot's Point Development Authority/Museum, where she was used mostly as a barracks boat.Patriots Point Receives Former Coast Guard Cutter, Newsletter, Volume 10, No. 2, Fall 1984, North American Society for Oceanic History, Inc. website The ship was badly damaged in Hurricane Hugo in Sept 1989 by banging up against sister museum ship USS Yorktown.Buxton, Geordie and Ed Macy, Haunted Harbor: Charleston's Maritime Ghosts and the Unexplained, p 58 In 1989 the museum was discussing the disposal of the cutter, but in 1991, when Patriot's Point was taken over by the State of South Carolina, the ship was still listed among its assets.Patriots' Point Naval and Maritime Museum, Bill 50, 109th Session, 1991-1992, General Assembly of the State of South Carolina She was later donated to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and sunk as to form Comanche Reef 12 miles out of Charleston in 1992.

High School is also the history of its component schools, Vermont High School, Ipava High School, and Table Grove High School. VHS formed in 1947 when the three schools consolidated.  Vermont High School  It is believed that a high school existed in the town of Vermont, Illinois since the late 19th century. However, the late 1940s brought the pressure of consolidation throughout the state of Illinois, especially smaller towns like Vermont, Ipava, and Table Grove. In 1947, the three towns consolidated to create the Vermont-Ipava-Table Grove (V.I.T.) School District. The schools for the district are now located just south of Table Grove.Vermont High School  Ipava High School  Education existed in Ipava, Illinois since the early 19th century with a stone building built in 1830 serving as the first school building. Another building was built in the 1850s. The first high school class graduated in 1884. The Ipava High School mascot was the Bulldog and its colors were blue and gold. After several decades of high school education, in the mid-1940s talks arose of a consolidation with the nearby school districts in Table Grove and Vermont. The consolidation became a reality in 1947 with the creation of the Vermont-Ipava-Table Grove School District. The Ipava school continued to host grades 1 - 6 for the V.I.T. school district for several years after the consolidation. A new elementary school was built near the V.I.T. high school in the 1970s. After this time the former Ipava school building served as a senior citizens center for a short while before being razed.Ipava High School Bulldogs  Table Grove High School  Table Grove's first school house was established in 1845. A high school was later started in the late 1880s, with its first graduate in 1891. A newer community high school was incorporated in 1920. Consolidation talks arose in the 1940s with the neighboring towns of Ipava and Vermont. The actual consolidation occurred in 1947 with the establishment of the Vermont-Ipava-Table Grove (V.I.T.)

He arrived there around 1877 and set up a ranch in the San Simon Valley. Olney moved from Texas under circumstances which were notorious.  Early life  Joseph Graves Olney was born in Burleson County, Texas to Joseph and Mary K. (Tanner) Olney on October 9, 1849. The family remained in Burleson until 1860, then they moved their ranch to Burnet County, Texas. In 1870, Olney married Agnes Jane Arnold and set up his own ranch in neighboring Llano County, Texas. About this time, Olney became friends with cowboy Johnny Ringo.  Texas  In 1872, Olney served in John Alexander's Company O of the Texas Minutemen and participated in action against Indian raiders. His name appears on the court dockets for minor indictments such as exhibiting a Monte Bank and gaming. Over the next few years, Olney, along with John Ringo and the Baird brothers, became involved in the Mason County Hoo Doo War. As the situation escalated, Scott Cooley and John Ringo were arrested and incarcerated in the Lampasas County jail. It is believed that Olney and John Baird were the leaders of the group that sprung the two out. It is also believed that Olney hid Ringo in Llano.  Gunfight  The morning of September 7, 1876 brought two riders, Deputy Sheriff S.B. Martin and Wilson Rowntree, to the Olney ranch. Not recognizing Olney, they asked where to ford the river. Olney directed them, and feeling suspicious, he followed the men. Martin and Rowntree then recognized Olney. A gun battle ensued in which Rowntree was wounded in the arm and Martin was killed. Olney attempted to exonerate himself by submitting his explanation to the local paper. He fled to New Mexico where he began using the alias Joe Hill. His name appeared on Governor Lew Wallace's list of outlaws. He was a wanted man listed as \\"Joseph Hill (alias Olney) killing a Deputy Shff.

He drove cattle between the two ranches and up to San Carlos Reservation for sale to Indian agents. On one such drive, Olney, John Ringo, Ike Clanton, and Al Turner hurrahed the town of Safford, Arizona, a typical cowboy behavior. Olney and Ringo were present at the 1881 killing of Dick Lloyd. The two men and others were playing cards in the saloon when the drunk Dick Lloyd shot Ed Mann, mounted Olney's horse, and rode into the saloon. Lloyd was shot by Jack O'Neal. Olney and Ringo also rode together as part of the 1882 posse that pursued the Earps after the vendetta killings of Frank Stilwell and a Mexican, Florentino Cruz.  Later life and death  After John Ringo's death in 1882, Joseph Olney's life finally began to settle down. He died on December 3, 1884 survived by his wife, Agnes Jane, and five children under the age of 15.

Big Brother Watch has also campaigned to protect victims of crime from 'digital strip searches' of their mobile phones by police, especially victims of sexual violence. They campaigned alongside other rights and justice groups including End Violence Against Women, Rape Crisis England and Wales and the Centre for Women's Justice. In 2019, Big Brother Watch investigated and succeeded in getting HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to delete over 5 million people's voice biometrics, which had been collected without people's consent or knowledge, in breach of data protection laws, from a HMRC database. It is believed to be the biggest ever deletion of biometric IDs from a state-held database. In 2017, Big Brother Watch took a case against the United Kingdom, together with Open Rights Group and English PEN, to the European Court of Human Rights arguing that UK surveillance laws infringed UK citizens' right to privacy. Big Brother Watch was part of the anti-surveillance coalition Don't Spy On Us, which campaigned against the proposed bulk communications collection powers and lack of judicial safeguards in the Investigatory Powers Bill, now Investigatory Powers Act, in 2015 and 2016. The organisation has published reports investigating police access to people's personal mobile phone information, police use of body worn cameras, surveillance technology in schools and the use of outdated communications laws to prosecute internet speech. In 2012, Big Brother Watch shut down its website in protest at the Stop Online Piracy Act and PROTECT IP Act proposed United States legislation, warning that similar plans may be proposed in the UK. It has carried out investigations into local authority data handling, finding more than 1000 incidents in which councils lost information about children and those in care.

A unibranch local ring is said to be geometrically unibranch if the residue field of B is a purely inseparable extension of the residue field of Ared. A complex variety X is called topologically unibranch at a point x if for all complements Y of closed algebraic subsets of X there is a fundamental system of neighborhoods (in the classical topology) of x whose intersection with Y is connected. In particular, a normal ring is unibranch. The notions of unibranch and geometrically unibranch points are used in some theorems in algebraic geometry. For example, there is the following result: Theorem Let X and Y be two integral locally noetherian schemes and f \\\\colon X \\\\to Y a proper dominant morphism. Denote their function fields by K(X) and K(Y), respectively. Suppose that the algebraic closure of K(Y) in K(X) has separable degree n and that y \\\\in Y is unibranch. Then the fiber f^{-1}(y) has at most n connected components. In particular, if f is birational, then the fibers of unibranch points are connected. In EGA, the theorem is obtained as a corollary of Zariski's main theorem.

Early life and education Craig Becker was born to Ruth and Sam Becker; his mother, who had fled Nazi Germany through England in 1939, was a nurse and community activist, and his father was a World War II veteran who became a professor and chair of the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Iowa. Becker graduated from Yale University in 1978, and Yale Law School in 1981. He was an editor of the Yale Law Journal.  Work experience (through 2009) Becker clerked for Judge Donald P. Lay from 1981 through 1983. He then worked at Kirschner, Weinberg & Dempsey (1983‚Äì1989), a law firm located in Washington, D.C., and represented members of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees and its affiliates, including the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers. He was a faculty member at UCLA Law School (1989‚Äì1994) and has also taught at Georgetown University Law School (1987‚Äì1988, 2012), the University of Chicago Law School (1994‚Äì95), and Yale Law School (2016, 2017, 2019). He has been Associate General Counsel to the AFL-CIO and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Throughout his career, he has argued many cases in court, including in front of the Supreme Court of the United States. In 2009, he was a member of the Obama transition team, assisting with the review of the United States Department of Labor. Appointment Becker was nominated by President Barack Obama for a seat on the National Labor Relations Board; a 13-10 vote by a Senate panel on Feb 4, 2010 allowed his nomination to move to the Senate floor.Senate panel approves labor board nominee Craig Becker, Los Angeles Times, February 4, 2010 However, his nomination failed to move to a floor vote on a vote of 52-33, falling eight short of the votes needed to block a Republican filibuster. On March 27, 2010, President Obama made a recess appointment of Becker to the National Labor Relations Board. The president's action enabled Becker to serve without Senate confirmation until the chamber adjourned at the end of 2011. On January 26, 2011, Obama renominated Becker to the same seat, which was to expire in December 2014. However, Becker's nomination remained stalled in the Senate, and with Becker's recess appointment drawing to a close, Obama withdrew the nomination on December 15, 2011. As such, Becker's term on the board ended at the end of December 2011. His recess appointment was upheld, under Noel Canning, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2014. After leaving the National Labor Relations Board, he taught at Georgetown Law School and is now General Counsel of the AFL-CIO. Personal life Becker resides in Washington, D.C. with his wife, Amy Dru Stanley, a history professor at the University of Chicago. He has two sons.

He was born in Milan, the son of Giuseppe Mangiarotti, a fencer at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. He was also the brother of Edoardo Mangiarotti, Italy's most successful Olympian and the winner of more Olympic and World titles than any fencer in history, and Mario Mangiarotti, who was also a fencer. Biography He was taught the sport of fencing by his father and first became the individual Italian √©p√©e champion in 1936, a title that he would claim again in 1938, 1940, 1946, 1951, and 1953. He accumulated a total of seven medals in the team √©p√©e events at the FIE World Championships in Fencing: four gold (1937, 1949, 1950, 1953), one silver (1951), and two bronze (1938, 1947). He also won a gold medal in the individual √©p√©e event in 1949 and a bronze in the same competition in 1950. At the 1948 Summer Games in London, he won a silver medal in the team √©p√©e event after the Italian team finished as runners-up to France. At the 1952 edition in Helsinki, however, the Italian team captured the gold medal, and Mangiarotti captured an additional silver medal in the individual √©p√©e competition, finishing behind his brother Edoarado. He won his final title at the 1966 World Masters Championships in Rome in the individual √©p√©e category. In 1967 he took up the position of Head Maestro of the Italian fencing school Circolo della Spada, a position that he still held as of his 90th birthday in 2005. His niece Carola is also an Olympic fencer who competed in the 1976 and 1980 editions of the Games. Another brother, Mario, was also a fencer before he retired from the sport to become a cardiologist. He died on 9 April 2010 in Lavagna, at the age of 94.

Its study affords important information about the religion, traditions and beliefs of the ancient Romans. This legacy is conspicuous in European cultural history in its influence on later juridical and religious vocabulary in Europe, particularly of the Western Church.Robert Schilling, \\"The Decline and Survival of Roman Religion\\", Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1982, from the French edition of 1981), p. 110 online.

Glossary A abominari The verb abominari (\\"to avert an omen\\", from ab-, \\"away, off,\\" and ominari, \\"to pronounce on an omen\\") was a term of augury for an action that rejects or averts an unfavourable omen indicated by a signum, \\"sign\\". The noun is abominatio, from which English \\"abomination\\" derives. At the taking of formally solicited auspices (auspicia impetrativa), the observer was required to acknowledge any potentially bad sign occurring within the templum he was observing, regardless of the interpretation.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1982), p. 2266, note 472. He might, however, take certain actions in order to ignore the signa, including avoiding the sight of them, and interpreting them as favourable. The latter tactic required promptness, wit and skill based on discipline and learning.J. Bayet Histoire politique et psychologique de la religion romaine Paris, 1969, p. 55. Thus the omen had no validity apart from the observation of it.Synonyms for abominari include improbare, execrari, and refutare, with instances noted by Cicero, De divinatione 1.46; Livy, 1.7, 5.55, 9.14, and 29.29; and Servius, note to Aeneid 5.530; Auguste Bouch√©- Leclercq, Histoire de la divination dans l'antiquit√© (J√©r√¥me Millon, 2003 reprint, originally published 1893), pp. 136‚Äì137.  aedes The aedes was the dwelling place of a god.Robert Schilling, \\"Roman Gods\\", Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 72. It was thus a structure that housed the deity's image, distinguished from the templum or sacred district.John W. Stamper, The Architecture of Roman Temples: The Republic to the Middle Empire (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 10. Aedes is one of several Latin words that can be translated as \\"shrine\\" or \\"temple\\"; see also delubrum and fanum. For instance, the Temple of Vesta, as it is called in English, was in Latin an aedes.Mary Beard, Simon Price, John North, Religions of Rome: Volume 1, a History, illustrated, Cambridge University Press, 1998. p. 22. See also the diminutive aedicula, a small shrine. aedes of Vesta In his work On Architecture, Vitruvius always uses the word templum in the technical sense of a space defined through augury, with aedes the usual word for the building itself.Morris H. Morgan, Notes on Vitruvius Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 17 (1903, pp. 12‚Äì14). The design of a deity's aedes, he writes, should be appropriate to the characteristics of the deity. For a celestial deity such as Jupiter, Coelus, Sol or Luna, the building should be open to the sky; an aedes for a god embodying virtus (valour), such as Minerva, Mars, or Hercules, should be Doric and without frills; the Corinthian order is suited for goddesses such as Venus, Flora, Proserpina and the Lymphae; and the Ionic is a middle ground between the two for Juno, Diana, and Father Liber. Thus in theory, though not always in practice, architectural aesthetics had a theological dimension.Vitruvius, De architectura 1.2.5; John E. Stambaugh, \\"The Functions of Roman Temples,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16.1 (1978), p. 561. The word aedilis (aedile), a public official, is related by etymology; among the duties of the aediles was the overseeing of public works, including the building and maintenance of temples.Andrew Lintott, The Constitution of the Roman Republic (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999, reprinted 2002), pp. 129‚Äì130; Karl Loewenstein, The Governance of Rome (Martinus Nijhoff, 1973), p. 62. The temple (aedes) of Flora, for instance, was built in 241 BC by two aediles acting on Sibylline oracles. The plebeian aediles had their headquarters at the aedes of Ceres.Lawrence Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), pp. 80‚Äì81 on Ceres, p. 151 on Flora; see also Barbette Stanley Spaeth, The Roman Goddess Ceres (University of Texas Press, 1996), p. 86ff. ager In religious usage, ager (territory, country, land, region) was terrestrial space defined for the purposes of augury in relation to auspicia. There were five kinds of ager: Romanus, Gabinus, peregrinus, hosticus and incertus. The ager Romanus originally included the urban space outside the pomerium and the surrounding countryside.J. Linderski Augural law in ANRW pp. According to Varro, the ager Gabinus pertained to the special circumstances of the oppidum of Gabii, which was the first to sign a sacred treaty (pax) with Rome.Varro, De lingua latina 5.33. See also Roger D. Woodard, Indo-European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult (Chicago 2006), pp. 236-238. The treaty was preserved in the temple of Semo Sancus. The ager peregrinusFor usage of the term peregrinus, compare also the status of a person who was peregrinus. was other territory that had been brought under treaty (pacatus). Ager hosticus meant foreign territory; incertus, \\"uncertain\\" or \\"undetermined,\\" that is, not falling into one of the four defined categories.Varro, De lingua latina 5.33. The powers and actions of magistrates were based on and constrained by the nature of the ager on which they stood, and ager in more general usage meant a territory as defined legally or politically. The ager Romanus could not be extended outside Italy (terra Italia).Livy 27.5.15 and 29.5; P. Catalano, Aspetti spaziali del sistema giuridico-religioso romano, Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16.1 (1978), pp. 529 ff. Altar (ara) from Roman Spain ara The focal point of sacrifice was the altar (ara, plural arae). Most altars throughout the city of Rome and in the countryside would have been simple, open-air structures; they may have been located within a sacred precinct (templum), but often without an aedes housing a cult image.Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 83. An altar that received food offerings might also be called a mensa, \\"table.\\"Ulrike Egelhaaf-Gaiser, \\"Roman Cult Sites: A Pragmatic Approach,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 206. Perhaps the best-known Roman altar is the elaborate and Greek-influenced Ara Pacis, which has been called \\"the most representative work of Augustan art.\\"Karl Galinsky, Augustan Culture: An Interpretive Introduction (Princeton University Press, 1996), p. 141. Other major public altars included the Ara Maxima. arbor felix A tree (arbor) was categorized as felix if it was under the protection of the heavenly gods (di superi). The adjective felix here means not only literally \\"fruitful\\" but more broadly \\"auspicious\\". MacrobiusMacrobius III 20, 2, quoting Veranius in his lost work De verbis pontificalibus. lists arbores felices (plural) as the oak (four species thereof), the birch, the hazelnut, the sorbus, the white fig, the pear, the apple, the grape, the plum, the cornus and the lotus. The oak was sacred to Jupiter, and twigs of oak were used by the Vestals to ignite the sacred fire in March every year. Also among the felices were the olive tree, a twig of which was affixed to the hat of the Flamen Dialis, and the laurel and the poplar, which crowned the Salian priests.Macrobius III 12 Arbores infelices were those under the protection of chthonic gods or those gods who had the power of turning away misfortune (avertentium). As listed by Tarquitius Priscus in his lost ostentarium on trees,Quoted by Macrobius, Saturnalia 3.20. these were buckthorn, red cornel, fern, black fig, \\"those that bear a black berry and black fruit,\\" holly, woodland pear, butcher's broom, briar, and brambles.\\"These are the modern English identifications of Robert A. Kaster in his translation of the Saturnalia for the Loeb Classical Library; in Latin, alternum sanguinem filicem, ficum atram, quaeque bacam nigram nigrosque fructus ferunt, itemque acrifolium, pirum silvaticum, pruscum rubum sentesque. On the textual issues raised by the passage, see Kaster, Studies on the Text of Macrobius' Saturnalia (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 48. attrectare The verb attrectare (\\"to touch, handle, lay hands on\\") referred in specialized religious usage to touching sacred objects while performing cultic actions. Attrectare had a positive meaning only in reference to the actions of the sacerdotes populi Romani (\\"priests of the Roman people\\"). It had the negative meaning of \\"contaminate\\" (= contaminare) or pollute when referring to the handling of sacred objects by those not authorized, ordained, or ritually purified.Vergil Aeneid II 717-720; Macrobius III 1, 1; E. Paratore Virgilio, Eneide I, Milano, 1978, p. 360 and n. 52; Livy V 22, 5; R. G. Austin P. Vergili Maronis Aeneidos liber secundus Oxford 1964, p. 264 augur An augur (Latin plural augures) was an official and priest who solicited and interpreted the will of the gods regarding a proposed action. The augur ritually defined a templum, or sacred space, declared the purpose of his consultation, offered sacrifice, and observed the signs that were sent in return, particularly the actions and flight of birds. If the augur received unfavourable signs, he could suspend, postpone or cancel the undertaking (obnuntiatio). \\"Taking the auspices\\" was an important part of all major official business, including inaugurations, senatorial debates, legislation, elections and war, and was held to be an ancient prerogative of Regal and patrician magistrates. Under the Republic, this right was extended to other magistrates. After 300 BC, plebeians could become augurs. auguraculum The solicitation of formal auspices required the marking out of ritual space (auguraculum) from within which the augurs observed the templum, including the construction of an augural tent or hut (tabernaculum). There were three such sites in Rome: on the citadel (arx), on the Quirinal Hill, and on the Palatine Hill. Festus said that originally the auguraculum was in fact the arx. It faced east, situating the north on the augur's left or lucky side.William Warde Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922), p. 209. A magistrate who was serving as a military commander also took daily auspices, and thus a part of camp-building while on campaign was the creation of a tabernaculum augurale. This augural tent was the center of religious and legal proceedings within the camp.John Scheid, An Introduction to Roman Religion (Indiana University Press, 2003), pp. 113‚Äì114; Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), pp. 2164‚Äì2288, especially p. 2174 on the military auguraculum. augurium Augurium (plural auguria) is an abstract noun that pertains to the augur. It seems to mean variously: the \\"sacral investiture\\" of the augur;Robert Schilling, Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 95. the ritual acts and actions of the augurs;In the view of Wissowa, as cited by Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), p. 2150. augural law (ius augurale);Linderski, \\"The Augural Law,\\" pp. 2241 et passim. and recorded signs whose meaning had already been established.Linderski, \\"The Augural Law,\\" p. 2237. The word is rooted in the IE stem *aug-, \\"to increase,\\" and possibly an archaic Latin neuter noun *augus, meaning \\"that which is full of mystic force.\\" As the sign that manifests the divine will,Schilling, \\"Augurs and Augury,\\" Roman and European Mythologies, p. 115. the augurium for a magistrate was valid for a year; a priest's, for his lifetime; for a temple, it was perpetual.Veit Rosenberger, \\"Republican nobiles: Controlling the res publica,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 299. The distinction between augurium and auspicium is often unclear. Auspicia is the observation of birds as signs of divine will, a practice held to have been established by Romulus, first king of Rome, while the institution of augury was attributed to his successor Numa.Schilling, p. 115. For Servius, an augurium is the same thing as auspicia impetrativa, a body of signs sought through prescribed ritual means.Linderski, \\"The Augural Law,\\" p. 2196, especially note 177, citing Servius, note to Aeneid 3.89. Some scholars think auspicia would belong more broadly to the magistracies and the patresSee Livy, Book VI 41, for the words of Appius Claudius Crassus on why election to the consulate should be restricted to patricians on these grounds. while the augurium would be limited to the rex sacrorum and the major priesthoods.Linderski, \\"The Augural Law,\\" pp. 2294‚Äì2295; U. Coli, Regnum Rome 1959. Ancient sources record three auguria: the augurium salutis in which every year the gods were asked whether it was fas (permissible, right) to ask for the safety of the Roman people (August 5); the augurium canarium, a dog sacrifice to promote the maturation of grain crops, held in the presence of the pontiffs as well as the augurs;Pliny, Natural History 18.14.: \\"when ears of wheat have already formed but are still in the sheaths\\". and the vernisera auguria mentioned by Festus, which should have been a springtime propitiary rite held at the time of the harvest (auguria messalia). auspex The auspex, plural auspices, is a diviner who reads omens from the observed flight of birds (avi-, from avis, \\"bird\\", with -spex, \\"observer\\", from spicere). See auspicia following and auspice. auspicia The auspicia (au- = avis, \\"bird\\"; -spic-, \\"watch\\") were originally signs derived from observing the flight of birds within the templum of the sky. Auspices are taken by an augur. Originally they were the prerogative of the patricians,Liv. VI 41; X 81; IV 6 but the college of augurs was opened to plebeians in 300 BC.With the passing of the Lex Ogulnia. The first plebeian consul was elected in 367 BC in consequence of the leges Liciniae Sextiae. Only magistrates were in possession of the auspicia publica, with the right and duty to take the auspices pertaining to the Roman state.L. Schmitz, entry on \\"Augur,\\" in A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (London 1875). Favorable auspices marked a time or location as auspicious, and were required for important ceremonies or events, including elections, military campaigns and pitched battles. According to Festus, there were five kinds of auspicia to which augurs paid heed: ex caelo, celestial signs such as thunder and lightning; ex avibus, signs offered by birds; ex tripudiis, signs produced by the actions of certain sacred chickens; ex quadrupedibus, signs from the behavior of four-legged animals; and ex diris, threatening portents.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The libri reconditi\\", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 89 (1985), pp. 226‚Äì227; Robert Schilling, \\"Augurs and Augury\\", Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 116. In official state augury at Rome, only the auspicia ex caelo and ex avibus were employed. The taking of the auspices required ritual silence (silentium). Watching for auspices was called spectio or servare de caelo. The appearance of expected signs resulted in nuntiatio, or if they were unfavourable obnuntiatio. If unfavourable auspices were observed, the business at hand was stopped by the official observer, who declared alio die (\\"on another day\\").Schmitz, \\"Augur.\\" The practice of observing bird omens was common to many ancient peoples predating and contemporaneous with Rome, including the Greeks, Celts,According to the Augustan historian Pompeius Trogus, who was himself a Celt of the Vocontii civitas, the Celts had acquired expertise in the practice of augury beyond other peoples (nam augurandi studio Galli praeter ceteros callent, as epitomized by Justin 42.4). Discussion of Celtic augury by J.A. MacCulloch, The Religion of the Ancient Celts (Edinburgh, 1911), p. 247. and Germans. auspicia impetrativa Auspicia impetrativa were signs that were solicited under highly regulated ritual conditions (see spectio and servare de caelo) within the templum.Robert Schilling, \\"Augurs and Augury\\", Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 116. The type of auspices required for convening public assemblies were impetrativa,W. Jeffrey Tatum, The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), p. 127. and magistrates had the \\"right and duty\\" to seek these omens actively.Andrew Lintott, The Constitution of the Roman Republic (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999, reprinted 2002), p. 103 online. These auspices could only be sought from an auguraculum, a ritually constructed augural tent or \\"tabernacle\\" (tabernaculum).John Scheid, An Introduction to Roman Religion (Indiana University Press, 2003), pp. 113‚Äì114. Contrast auspicia oblativa. auspicia maiora The right of observing the \\"greater auspices\\" was conferred on a Roman magistrate holding imperium, perhaps by a Lex curiata de imperio, although scholars are not agreed on the finer points of law.H.S. Versnel, Triumphus: An Inquiry into the Origin, Development and Meaning of the Roman Triumph (Brill, 1970), p. 324 online et passim. A censor had auspicia maxima.T. Corey Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 19 online. It is also thought that the flamines maiores were distinguished from the minores by their right to take the auspicia maiora; see Flamen. auspicia oblativa Signs that occurred without deliberately being sought through formal augural procedure were auspicia oblativa. These unsolicited signs were regarded as sent by a deity or deities to express either approval or disapproval for a particular undertaking. The prodigy (prodigium) was one form of unfavourable oblativa.Veit Rosenberger, \\"Republican nobiles: Controlling the res publica\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 293. Contrast auspicia impetrativa. auspicia privata Private and domestic religion was linked to divine signs as state religion was. It was customary in patrician families to take the auspices for any matter of consequence such as marriages, travel, and important business.Cicero, De divinatione I 28. The scant information about auspicia privata in ancient authorsCicero, de Divinatione I 28; Cato the Elder, as quoted by Festus p. 342 L 2nd. suggests that the taking of private auspices was not different in essence from that of public auspices: absolute silence was required,Festus sv. Silentio surgere, p. 438 L 2nd. and the person taking the auspices could ignore unfavourable or disruptive events by feigning not to have perceived them.G. Dumezil La religion romaine archaique Paris 1974 part IV chapt. 4; It. tr. Milano 1977 p. 526 In matters pertaining to the family or individual, both lightningPliny the Elder, Natural History 2, 13; Plautus, Curculio 438-484. and exta (entrails)Festus, sv. regalia exta p. 382 L 2nd (p. 367 in the 1997 Teubner edition). might yield signs for privati, private citizens not authorized to take official auspices. Among his other duties, the Pontifex Maximus advised privati as well as the official priests about prodigies and their forestalling.Livy I 20, 7. averruncare In pontifical usage, the verb averruncare, \\"to avert,\\" denotes a ritual action aimed at averting a misfortune intimated by an omen. Bad omens (portentaque prodigiaque mala) are to be burnt, using trees that are in the tutelage of underworld or \\"averting\\" gods (see arbores infelices above).Macrobius, Saturnalia III 20 3, citing Tarquitius Priscus: \\"It is necessary to order evil portents and prodigies to be burnt by means of trees which are in the tutelage of infernal or averting gods,\\" with an enumeration of such trees (Arbores quae inferum deorum avertentiumque in tutela sunt ... quibus portenta prodigiaque mala comburi iubere oportet). Varro says that the god who presides over the action of averting is Averruncus.Varro, De Lingua Latina VII 102: \\"Ab avertendo averruncare, ut deus qui in eis rebus praeest Averruncus.\\" B bellum iustum A \\"just war\\" was a war considered justifiable by the principles of fetial law (ius fetiale).Livy 1.32; 31.8.3; 36.3.9 Because war could bring about religious pollution, it was in itself nefas, \\"wrong,\\" and could incur the wrath of gods unless iustum, \\"just\\".William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London 1925), pp. 33ff.; M. Kaser, Das altroemische Ius (Goettingen 1949), pp. 22ff; P. Catalano, Linee del sistema sovrannazionale romano (Torino 1965), pp. 14ff.; W. V. Harris, War and imperialism in Republican Rome, 327-70 B.C. (Oxford 1979), pp. 161 ff. The requirements for a just war were both formal and substantive. As a formal matter, the war had to be declared according to the procedures of the ius fetiale. On substantive grounds, a war required a \\"just cause,\\" which might include rerum repetitio, retaliation against another people for pillaging, or a breach of or unilateral recession from a treaty; or necessity, as in the case of repelling an invasion.Livy 9.1.10; Cicero, Divinatio in Caecilium 63; De provinciis consularibus 4; Ad Atticum VII 14, 3; IX 19, 1; Pro rege Deiotauro 13; De officiis I 36; Philippicae XI 37; XIII 35; De re publica II 31; III 35; Isidore of Seville, Origines XVIII 1, 2; Modestinus, Libro I regolarum = Digesta I 3, 40; E. Badian, Roman Imperialism in the Late Republic (Ithaca 1968, 2nd ed.), p.11. See also Jus ad bellum. C caerimonia The English word \\"ceremony\\" derives from the Latin caerimonia or caeremonia, a word of obscure etymology first found in literature and inscriptions from the time of Cicero (mid-1st century BC), but thought to be of much greater antiquity. Its meaning varied over time. Cicero used caerimonia at least 40 times, in three or four different senses: \\"inviolability\\" or \\"sanctity\\", a usage also of Tacitus; \\"punctilious veneration\\", in company with cura (carefulness, concern); more commonly in the plural caerimoniae, to mean \\"ritual prescriptions\\" or \\"ritual acts.\\" The plural form is endorsed by Roman grammarians. Hendrik Wagenvoort maintained that caerimoniae were originally the secret ritual instructions laid down by Numa, which are described as statae et sollemnes, \\"established and solemn.\\"Valerius Maximus 1.1.1. These were interpreted and supervised by the College of Pontiffs, flamens, rex sacrorum and the Vestals. Later, caerimoniae might refer also to other rituals, including foreign cults.Hendrik Wagenvort, \\"Caerimonia\\", in Studies in Roman Literature, Culture and Religion (Brill, 1956), pp. 84‚Äì101. These prescribed rites \\"unite the inner subject with the external religious object\\", binding human and divine realms. The historian Valerius Maximus makes clear that the caerimoniae require those performing them to attain a particular mental-spiritual state (animus, \\"intention\\"), and emphasizes the importance of caerimoniae in the dedication and first sentence of his work. In Valerius's version of the Gallic siege of Rome, the Vestals and the Flamen Quirinalis rescue Rome's sacred objects (sacra) by taking them to Caere; thus preserved, the rites take their name from the place.Hans- Friedrich Mueller, Roman Religion in Valerius Maximus (Routledge, 2002), pp. 64‚Äì65 online. Although this etymology makes a meaningful narrative connection for Valerius,See Davide Del Bello, Forgotten Paths: Etymology and the Allegorical Mindset (Catholic University of America Press, 2007), pp. 34‚Äì46, on etymology as a form of interpretation or construction of meaning among Roman authors. it is unlikely to be correct in terms of modern scientific linguistics. An Etruscan origin has sometimes been proposed. Wagenvoort thought that caerimonia derived from caerus, \\"dark\\" in the sense of \\"hidden\\", hence meaning \\"darknesses, secrets.\\"Wagenvoort, \\"Caerimonia\\", p. 100 online. In his Etymologiae, Isidore of Seville says that the Greek equivalent is orgia, but derives the word from carendo, \\"lacking\\", and says that some think caerimoniae should be used of Jewish observances, specifically the dietary law that requires abstaining from or \\"lacking\\" certain foods.Isidore of Seville, Etymologiae 6.19.36 online. calator The calatores were assistants who carried out day-to-day business on behalf of the senior priests of the state such as the flamines maiores. A calator was a public slave.Festus, p. 354 L2 = p. 58 M; J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion of the Romans (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 227 online. Festus derives the word from the Greek verb kalein, \\"to call.\\" Augustus, capite velato capite velato At the traditional public rituals of ancient Rome, officiants prayed, sacrificed, offered libations, and practiced augury capite velato,Robert E.A.

This covering of the head is a distinctive feature of Roman rite in contrast with Etruscan practiceCapite aperto, \\"bareheaded\\"; Martin S√∂derlind, Late Etruscan Votive Heads from Tessennano (¬´L'Erma¬ª di Bretschneider, 2002), p. 370 online. or ritus graecus, \\"Greek rite.\\"Robert Schilling, \\"Roman Sacrifice\\", Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 78. In Roman art, the covered head is a symbol of pietas and the individual's status as a pontifex, augur or other priest.Classical Sculpture: Catalogue of the Cypriot, Greek, and Roman Stone Sculpture in the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 2006), p. 169. It has been argued that the Roman expression of piety capite velato influenced Paul's prohibition against Christians praying with covered heads: \\"Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.\\"; see Neil Elliott, Liberating Paul: The Justice of God and the Politics of the Apostle (Fortress Press, 1994, 2006), p. 210 online; Bruce W. Winter, After Paul Left Corinth: The Influence of Secular Ethics and Social Change (Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2001), pp. 121‚Äì123 online, citing as the standard source D.W.J.

The passage has been explained with reference to Jewish and other practices as well. carmen In classical Latin, carmen usually means \\"song, poem, ode.\\" In magico-religious usage, a carmen (plural carmina) is a chant, hymn, spell, or charm. In essence \\"a verbal utterance sung for ritualistic purposes\\", the carmen is characterized by formulaic expression, redundancy, and rhythm.Frances Hickson Hahn, \\"Performing the Sacred: Prayers and Hymns\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 236, citing also Michael C.J. Putnam, Horace's Carmen Saeculare (London, 2001), p. 133. Fragments from two archaic priestly hymns are preserved, the Carmen Arvale of the Arval Brethren and the Carmina Saliaria of the Salii. The Carmen Saeculare of Horace, though self-consciously literary in technique, was also a hymn, performed by a chorus at the Saecular Games of 17 BC and expressing the Apollonian ideology of Augustus.Sarah Iles Johnston, Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide (Harvard University Press, 2004), p. 367. A carmen malum or maleficum is a potentially harmful magic spell. A fragment of the Twelve Tables reading si malum carmen incantassit (\\"if anyone should chant an evil spell\\") shows that it was a concern of the law to suppress malevolent magic. A carmen sepulchrale is a spell that evokes the dead from their tombs; a carmen veneficum, a \\"poisonous\\" charm.Georg Luck, Arcana Mundi, p. 510. In magic, the word carmen comes to mean also the object on which a spell is inscribed, hence a charm in the physical sense.Bernadotte Filotas, Pagan Survivals, Superstitions and Popular Cultures in Early Medieval Pastoral Literature (Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 2005), p. 256. castus, castitas Castus is an adjective meaning morally pure or guiltless (English \\"chaste\\"), hence pious or ritually pure in a religious sense. Castitas is the abstract noun. Various etymologies have been proposed, among them two IE stems: *k'(e)stosCompare Sanskrit s'ista. meaning \\"he who conforms to the prescriptions of rite\\"; or *kas-, from which derives the verb careo, \\"I defice, am deprived of, have none...\\" i.e. vitia.M. Morani\\"Lat. 'sacer'...\\" Aevum LV 1981 p. 38. Another etymology connects it to Vedic s'asti, 'he gives the instruction', and to Avestic saas-tu, 'that he educate': in G. Dumezil La religion romaine archaique Paris, 1974, Remarques preliminaires IX In Roman religion, the purity of ritual and those who perform it is paramount: one who is correctly cleansed and castus in religious preparation and performance is likely to please the gods. Ritual error is a pollutant; it vitiates the performance and risks the gods' anger. Castus and castitas are attributes of the sacerdos (priest),Vergil, Aeneid, 6.661: \\"Sacerdotes casti dum vita manebat\\", in H. Fugier, Recherches... cit. p.18 ff. but substances and objects can also be ritually castus.See, for instance, mola salsa. cinctus gabinus The cinctus Gabinus (\\"belting from Gabii\\") was a way of wearing the toga thought to have originated in the nearby town of Gabii. A priest or officiant wearing it wore his toga bound around the waist in a way that left both hands free to perform ritual tasks, as the wearing of the toga usually did not.H.H. Scullard, A History of the Roman World: 753 to 146 BC (Routledge, 1935, 2013), p. 409.John Scheid, An Introduction to Roman Religion (Indiana University Press, 2003), p. 80. The cincture accompanied the veiling or covering of the head (capite velato) with a cowl-like fold of the toga.Servius, note to Aeneid 5.755. Like the conical, helmet-like headgear worn by priests such as the Salii, the Gabinian cincture was originally associated with warriors, and was worn for a solemn declaration of war. It was also part of Etruscan priestly dress.Servius, note to Aeneid 7.612; Larissa Bonfante, \\"Ritual Dress,\\" p. 185, and Fay Glinister, \\"Veiled and Unveiled: Uncovering Roman Influence in Hellenistic Italy,\\" p. 197, both in Votives, Places, and Rituals in Etruscan Religion: Studies in Honor of Jean MacIntosh Turfa (Brill, 2009). clavum figere Clavum figere (\\"to nail in, to fasten or fix the nail\\") was an expression that referred to the fixing or \\"sealing\\" of fate.Cicero, In Verrem 5.21.53. A nail was one of the attributes of the goddess NecessitasHorace, Carmen 1.35, 17, 18; 3.24, 6, 6. and of the Etruscan goddess Athrpa (Greek Atropos). According to Livy, every year in the temple of Nortia, the Etruscan counterpart of Fortuna, a nail was driven in to mark the time. In Rome, the senior magistratePraetor maximus, the chief magistrate with imperium; T. Corey Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 21. on the Ides of September drove a nail called the clavus annalis (\\"year-nail\\")Festus, 49 in the edition of Linday, says that \\"the year-nail was so called because it was fixed into the walls of the sacred aedes every year, so that the number of years could be reckoned by means of them\\". into the wall of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. The ceremony occurred on the dies natalis (\\"birthday\\" or anniversary of dedication) of the temple, when a banquet for Jupiter (Epulum Jovis) was also held. The nail-driving ceremony, however, took place in a templum devoted to Minerva, on the right side of the aedes of Jupiter, because the concept of \\"number\\" was invented by Minerva and the ritual predated the common use of written letters.Livy, 7.3; Brennan, Praetorship, p. 21. The importance of this ritual is lost in obscurity, but in the early Republic it is associated with the appointment of a dictator clavi figendi causa, \\"dictator for the purpose of driving the nail,\\"Livy, 7.3. one of whom was appointed for the years 363, 331, 313, and 263 BC.The Fasti Capitolini record dictatores clavi figendi causa for 363, 331, and 263. Livy attributes this practice to religio, religious scruple or obligation. It may be that in addition to an annual ritual, there was a \\"fixing\\" during times of pestilence or civil discord that served as a piaculum.H.S. Versnel, Triumphus: An Inquiry into the Origin, Development and Meaning of the Roman Triumph (Brill, 1970), pp. 271‚Äì272. Livy says that in 363, a plague had been ravaging Rome for two years. It was recalled that a plague had once been broken when a dictator drove a ritual nail, and the senate appointed one for that purpose.Brennan, Praetorship, p. 21. The ritual of \\"driving the nail\\" was among those revived and reformed by Augustus, who in 1 AD transferred it to the new Temple of Mars Ultor. Henceforth a censor fixed the nail at the end of his term.Cassius Dio 55.10.4, as cited by Michael Lipka, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach (Brill, 2009), p. 108; Brennan, Praetorship, p. 21. collegium A collegium (\\"joined by law\\"), plural collegia, was any association with a legal personality. The priestly colleges oversaw religious traditions, and until 300 BC only patricians were eligible for membership. When plebeians began to be admitted, the size of the colleges was expanded. By the Late Republic, three collegia wielded greater authority than the others, with a fourth coming to prominence during the reign of Augustus. The four great religious corporations (quattuor amplissima collegia) were: *Pontifices, the College of Pontiffs headed by the Pontifex Maximus; *Augures; *Quindecimviri sacris faciundis, the fifteen priests in charge of the Sibylline Books; *Septemviri epulonum, the board of seven priests who organized public banquets for religious holidays. Augustus was a member of all four collegia, but limited membership for any other senator to one.David S. Potter, \\"Roman Religion: Ideas and Action\\", in Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire (University of Michigan, 1999), pp. 139‚Äì140. In Roman society, a collegium might also be a trade guild or neighborhood association; see Collegium (ancient Rome). comitia calata The comitia calata (\\"calate assemblies\\") were non-voting assemblies (comitia) called for religious purposes. The verb calare, originally meaning \\"to call,\\" was a technical term of pontifical usage, found also in calendae (Calends) and calator. According to Aulus Gellius,Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae XV 27, 1-3, citing Laelius Felix in reference to M. Antistius Labeo. these comitia were held in the presence of the college of pontiffs in order to inaugurate the rex (the king in the Regal Period or the rex sacrorum in the Republic)George Willis Botsford, The Roman Assemblies from Their Origin to the End of the Republic (Macmillan, 1909), pp. 155‚Äì165. or the flamines. The pontifex maximus auspiciated and presided; assemblies over which annually elected magistrates presided are never calata, nor are meetings for secular purposes or other elections even with a pontiff presiding.Botsford, Roman Assemblies, p. 153. The comitia calata were organized by curiae or centuriae.Botsford, Roman Assemblies, p. 154. The people were summoned to comitia calata to witness the reading of wills, or the oath by which sacra were renounced (detestatio sacrorum).Botsford, Roman Assemblies, pp. 104, 154. They took no active role and were only present to observe as witnesses.George Mousourakis, The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law (Ashgate, 2003), p. 105. Mommsen thought the calendar abbreviation QRCF, given once as Q. Rex C. F.In the Fasti Viae Lanza. and taken as Quando Rex Comitiavit Fas, designated a day when it was religiously permissible for the rex to \\"call\\" for a comitium, hence the comitia calata.As summarized by J√∂rg R√ºpke, The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine: Time, History, and the Fasti (Wiley-Blackwell, 2011), pp. 26‚Äì27. commentarii augurales The Commentaries of the Augurs were written collections probably of the decreta and responsa of the college of augurs. Some scholarship, however, maintains that the commentarii were precisely not the decreta and responsa.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), p. 2245, note 387. The commentaries are to be distinguished from the augurs' libri reconditi, texts not for public use.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The libri reconditi\\", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 89 (1985), pp. 228‚Äì229. The books are mentioned by Cicero,Cicero de Div. II 42 Festus,Festus, book 17, p. 819. and Servius Danielis.Serv. Dan. Aen. I 398 Livy includes several examples of the augurs' decreta and responsa in his history, presumably taken from the commentarii.Livy, IV 31, 4; VIII 15, 6; XXIII 31, 13; XLI 18, 8. commentarii pontificum The Commentaries of the Pontiffs contained a record of decrees and official proceedings of the College of Pontiffs. Priestly literature was one of the earliest written forms of Latin prose, and included rosters, acts (acta), and chronicles kept by the various collegia,Moses Hadas, A History of Latin Literature (Columbia University Press, 1952), p. 15 online. as well as religious procedure.C.O. Brink, Horace on Poetry. Epistles Book II: The Letters to Augustus and Florus (Cambridge University Press, 1982), p. 64 online. It was often occultum genus litterarum,Cicero, De domo sua 136. an arcane form of literature to which by definition only priests had access. The commentarii, however, may have been available for public consultation, at least by senators,Wilfried Stroh, \\"De domo sua: Legal Problem and Structure\\", in Cicero the Advocate (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 341. because the rulings on points of law might be cited as precedent.W.S. Teuffel, History of Roman Literature, translated by George C.W. Warr (London, 1900), vol. 1, p. 104 online. The public nature of the commentarii is asserted by Jerzy Linderski in contrast to libri reconditi, the secret priestly books.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The libri reconditi\\", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 89 (1985) 207‚Äì234, especially p. 216. The commentarii survive only through quotation or references in ancient authors.For example, Pliny, Natural History 18.14, in reference to the augurium canarium, a dog sacrifice. Other references include Cicero, Brutus 55 and De domo sua 186; Livy 4.3 and 6.1; Quintilian 8.2.12, as cited by Teuffel. These records are not readily distinguishable from the libri pontificales; some scholars maintain that the terms commentarii and libri for the pontifical writings are interchangeable. Those who make a distinction hold that the libri were the secret archive containing rules and precepts of the ius sacrum (holy law), texts of spoken formulae, and instructions on how to perform ritual acts, while the commentarii were the responsa (opinions and arguments) and decreta (binding explications of doctrine) that were available for consultation. Whether or not the terms can be used to distinguish two types of material, the priestly documents would have been divided into those reserved for internal use by the priests themselves, and those that served as reference works on matters external to the college.Linderski, \\"The libri reconditi\\", pp. 218‚Äì219. Collectively, these titles would have comprised all matters of pontifical law, ritual, and cult maintenance, along with prayer formulariesBrink, Horace on Poetry, p. 64. and temple statutes.Adolf Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law (American Philosophical Society, 1991 reprint), p. 399 online. See also libri pontificales and libri augurales. coniectura Coniectura is the reasoned but speculative interpretation of signs presented unexpectedly, that is, of novae res, \\"novel information.\\" These \\"new signs\\" are omens or portents not previously observed, or not observed under the particular set of circumstances at hand. Coniectura is thus the kind of interpretation used for ostenta and portenta as constituting one branch of the \\"Etruscan discipline\\"; contrast observatio as applied to the interpretation of fulgura (thunder and lightning) and exta (entrails). It was considered an ars, a \\"method\\" or \\"art\\" as distinguished from disciplina, a formal body of teachings which required study or training.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), 2231‚Äì2233, 2238. The origin of the Latin word coniectura suggests the process of making connections, from the verb conicio, participle coniectum (con-, \\"with, together\\", and iacio, \\"throw, put\\"). Coniectura was also a rhetorical term applied to forms of argumentation, including court cases.Greek stochasmos (œÉœÑŒøœáŒ±œÉŒºœåœÇ); Tobias Reinhardt, \\"Rhetoric in the Fourth Academy\\", Classical Quarterly 50 (2000), p. 534. The Greek equivalent of conicere is symballein, from which English \\"symbol\\" derives; Fran√ßois Guillaumont, \\"Divination et pr√©vision rationelle dans la correspondance de Cic√©ron,\\" in Epistulae Antiquae: Actes du Ier Colloque \\"Le genre √©pistolaire antique et ses prolongements (Universit√© Fran√ßois-Rabelais, Tours, 18-19 septembre 1998) (Peeters, 2002). The English word \\"conjecture\\" derives from coniectura. consecratio Consecratio was the ritual act that resulted in the creation of an aedes, a shrine that housed a cult image, or an ara, an altar. Jerzy Linderski insists that the consecratio should be distinguished from the inauguratio, that is, the ritual by which the augurs established a sacred place (locus) or templum (sacred precinct).Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), p. 2249 online. The consecration was performed by a pontiff reciting a formula from the libri pontificales, the pontifical books.Cicero, De domo sua 139; F. Sini, Documenti sacerdotali di Roma antica (Sassari, 1983), p.152 One component of consecration was the dedicatio, or dedication, a form of ius publicum (public law) carried out by a magistrate representing the will of the Roman people.Cicero. De domo sua 136. The pontiff was responsible for the consecration proper.J. Marquardt, R√∂mische Staatsverwaltung III (Leipzig, 1885), pp. 269 ff.; G. Wissowa, Religion und Kultus der R√∂mer, p.385. cultus Cicero defined religio as cultus deorum, \\"the cultivation of the gods.\\"Cicero, De Natura Deorum 2.8 and 1.117. The \\"cultivation\\" necessary to maintain a specific deity was that god's cultus, \\"cult,\\" and required \\"the knowledge of giving the gods their due\\" (scientia colendorum deorum).Clifford Ando, The Matter of the Gods (University of California Press, 2009), p. 6. The noun cultus originates from the past participle of the verb colo, colere, colui, cultus, \\"to tend, take care of, cultivate,\\" originally meaning \\"to dwell in, inhabit\\" and thus \\"to tend, cultivate land (ager); to practice agriculture,\\" an activity fundamental to Roman identity even when Rome as a political center had become fully urbanized. Cultus is often translated as \\"cult\\", without the negative connotations the word may have in English, or with the Anglo-Saxon word \\"worship\\", but it implies the necessity of active maintenance beyond passive adoration. Cultus was expected to matter to the gods as a demonstration of respect, honor, and reverence; it was an aspect of the contractual nature of Roman religion (see do ut des).Ando, The Matter of the Gods, pp. 5‚Äì7; Valerie M. Warrior, Roman Religion (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 6; James B. Rives, Religion in the Roman Empire (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 13, 23. St. Augustine echoes Cicero's formulation when he declares that \\"religio is nothing other than the cultus of God.\\"Augustine, De Civitate Dei 10.1; Ando, The Matter of the Gods, p. 6. D decretum Decreta (plural) were the binding explications of doctrine issued by the official priests on questions of religious practice and interpretation. They were preserved in written form and archived.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The libri reconditi\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 89 (1985), pp. 218‚Äì219. Compare responsum. delubrum A delubrum was a shrine. Varro says it was a building that housed the image of a deus, \\"god\\",Sabine MacCormack, The Shadows of Poetry: Vergil in the Mind of Augustine (University of California Press, 1998), p. 75. and emphasizes the human role in dedicating the statue.Clifford Ando, The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire (University of California Press, 2008), p. 110. According to Varro,apud Nonius p. 792 L. the delubrum was the oldest form of an aedes, a structure that housed a god. It is an ambiguous term for both the building and the surrounding area ubi aqua currit (\\"where water runs\\"), according to the etymology of the antiquarian Cincius.As recorded by Servius, ad Aen. II 225. Festus gives the etymology of delubrum as fustem delibratum, \\"stripped stake,\\" that is, a tree deprived of its bark (liber) by a lightning bolt, as such trees in archaic times were venerated as gods. The meaning of the term later extended to denote the shrine built to house the stake.Festus De verborum significatu s.v. delubrum p. 64 L; G. Colonna \\"Sacred Architecture and the Religion of the Etruscans\\" in N. T. De Grummond The Religion of the Etruscans 2006 p. 165 n. 59. Compare aedes, fanum, and templum. Isidore connected the delubrum with the verb diluere, \\"to wash\\", describing it as a \\"spring-shrine\\", sometimes with annexed pool, where people would wash before entering, thus comparable to a Christian baptismal font.Isidore of Seville, Etymologiae 15.4.9; Stephen A. Barney, The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 310 online. detestatio sacrorum When a person passed from one gens to another, as for instance by adoption, he renounced the religious duties (sacra) he had previously held in order to assume those of the family he was entering.Servius, note to Aeneid 2.156; Robert Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome (Routledge, 2000), p. 44. The ritual procedure of detestatio sacrorum was enacted before a calate assembly.George Willis Botsford, The Roman Assemblies from Their Origin to the End of the Republic (Macmillan, 1909), pp. 161‚Äì162. deus, dea, di, dii Deus, \\"god\\"; dea, \\"goddess\\", plural deae; di or dii, \\"gods\\", plural, or \\"deities\\", of mixed gender. The Greek equivalent is theos, which the Romans translated with deus. Servius saysServius, note to Aeneid 12.139. that deus or dea is a \\"generic term\\" (generale nomen) for all gods.David Wardle, \\"Deus or Divus: The Genesis of Roman Terminology for Deified Emperors and a Philosopher's Contribution\\", in Philosophy and Power in the Graeco-Roman World: Essays in Honour of Miriam Griffin (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 182. In his lost work Antiquitates rerum divinarum, assumed to have been based on pontifical doctrine,Servius Aen. II 141: \\"pontifices dicunt singulis actibus proprios deos praeesse, hos Varro certos deos appellat\\", the pontiffs say that every single action is presided upon by its own deity, these Varro calls certain gods\\"; A. von Domaszewski, \\"Dii certi und incerti\\" in Abhandlungen fuer roemische Religion 1909 pp. 154-170. Varro classified dii as certi, incerti, praecipui or selecti, i.e. \\"deities whose function could be ascertained\\",J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion in Republican Rome: Rationalization and Ritual Change (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012), p. 183. those whose function was unknown or indeterminate, main or selected gods.As preserved by Augustine, De Civitate Dei VI 3. Compare divus. For etymological discussion, see Deus and Dyeus. See also List of Roman deities. devotio The devotio was an extreme form of votum in which a Roman general vowed to sacrifice his own life in battle along with the enemy to chthonic deities in exchange for a victory. The most extended description of the ritual is given by Livy, regarding the self-sacrifice of Decius Mus.Livy 8.9; for a brief introduction and English translation of the passage, see Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 157 online. The English word \\"devotion\\" derives from the Latin. For another votum that might be made in the field by a general, see evocatio. dies imperii A Roman emperor's dies imperii was the date on which he assumed imperium, that is, the anniversary of his accession as emperor. The date was observed annually with renewed oaths of loyalty and vota pro salute imperatoris, vows and offerings for the wellbeing (salus) of the emperor. Observances resembled those on January 3, which had replaced the traditional vows made for the salus of the republic after the transition to one-man rule under Augustus. The dies imperii was a recognition that succession during the Empire might take place irregularly through the death or overthrow of an emperor, in contrast to the annual magistracies of the Republic when the year was designated by the names of consuls serving their one-year term.Carlos F. Nore√±a, Imperial Ideals in the Roman West: Representation, Circulation, Power (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 142. The dies Augusti or dies Augustus was more generally any anniversary pertaining to the imperial family, such as birthdays or weddings, appearing on official calendars as part of Imperial cult.C.E.V. Nixon, In Praise of Later Roman Emperors: The Panegyrici Latini (University of California Press, 1994), pp. 179‚Äì185; Albino Garzetti, From Tiberius To The Antonines (Methuen, 1974), originally published 1960 in Italian), p. 618.

Bagnall and Raffaella Cribiore, Women's Letters from Ancient Egypt 300 BC‚ÄìAD 800 (University of Michigan Press, 2006), pp. 346‚Äì347. References to a dies Caesaris are also found, but it is unclear whether or how it differed from the dies Augusti.Nixon, In Praise of Later Roman Emperors, p. 182. Nero observed his dies imperii/decennalia - the 10-year anniversary of being emperor on October 13, 64 AD.https://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/PETEMART.HTM dies lustricus The dies lustricus (\\"day of purification\\") was a rite carried out for the newborn on the eighth day of life for girls and the ninth day for boys. Little is known of the ritual procedure, but the child must have received its name on that day; funerary inscriptions for infants who died before their dies lustricus are nameless.Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.16.36; William Warde Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922), pp. 28, 42. The youngest person found commemorated on a Roman tombstone by name was a male infant nine days old (or 10 days in Roman inclusive counting).Vernaclus was buried by his father, Lucius Cassius Tacitus, in Colonia Ubii. Maureen Carroll, Spirits of the Dead: Roman Funerary Commemoration in Western Europe (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 172. Because of the rate of infant mortality, perhaps as high as 40 percent,M. Golden, \\"Did the Ancients Care When Their Children Died?\\" Greece & Rome 35 (1988) 152‚Äì163. the newborn in its first few days of life was held as in a liminal phase, vulnerable to malignant forces (see List of Roman birth and childhood deities). Socially, the child did not exist.Christian Laes, Children in the Roman Empire: Outsiders Within (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 66. The dies lustricus may have been when the child received the bulla, the protective amulet that was put aside when a boy passed into adulthood.Jens-Uwe Krause, \\"Children in the Roman Family and Beyond,\\" in The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 627. dies natalis Page listing imperial natales by month from the 17th-century Codex Vaticanus Barberini latinus, based on the Calendar of Filocalus (354 AD) A dies natalis was a birthday (\\"natal day\\"; see also dies lustricus above) or more generally the anniversary of a founding event. The Romans celebrated an individual's birthday annually, in contrast to the Greek practice of marking the date each month with a simple libation. The Roman dies natalis was connected with the cult owed to the Genius.Denis Feeney, Caesar's Calendar: Ancient Time and the Beginnings of History, University of California Press (2008) p. 148. A public figure might schedule a major event on his birthday: Pompeius Magnus (\\"Pompey the Great\\") waited seven months after he returned from his military campaigns in the East before he staged his triumph, so he could celebrate it on his birthday.Feeney, Caesar's Calendar, pp. 148‚Äì149. The coincidence of birthdays and anniversaries could have a positive or negative significance: news of Decimus Brutus's victory at Mutina was announced at Rome on his birthday, while Caesar's assassin Cassius suffered defeat at Philippi on his birthday and committed suicide.Feeney, Caesar's Calendar, p. 149. Birthdays were one of the dates on which the dead were commemorated.Regina Gee, \\"From Corpse to Ancestor: The Role of Tombside Dining in the Transformation of the Body in Ancient Rome,\\" in The Materiality of Death: Bodies, Burials, Beliefs, Bar International Series 1768 (Oxford, 2008), p. 64. The date when a temple was founded, or when it was rededicated after a major renovation or rebuilding, was also a dies natalis, and might be felt as the \\"birthday\\" of the deity it housed as well. The date of such ceremonies was therefore chosen by the pontiffs with regard to its position on the religious calendar. The \\"birthday\\" or foundation date of Rome was celebrated April 21, the day of the Parilia, an archaic pastoral festival.Gary Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War (University of California Press, 2005, 2006), p. 131. As part of a flurry of religious reforms and restorations in the period from 38 BC to 17 AD, no fewer than fourteen temples had their dies natalis moved to another date, sometimes with the clear purpose of aligning them with new Imperial theology after the collapse of the Republic.Michael Lipka, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach (Brill, 2009), p. 47. The birthdays of emperors were observed with public ceremonies as an aspect of Imperial cult. The Feriale Duranum, a military calendar of religious observances, features a large number of imperial birthdays. Augustus shared his birthday (September 23) with the anniversary of the Temple of Apollo in the Campus Martius, and elaborated on his connection with Apollo in developing his special religious status. A birthday commemoration was also called a natalicium, which could take the form of a poem. Early Christian poets such as Paulinus of Nola adopted the natalicium poem for commemorating saints.Patricia Cox Miller, \\"'The Little Blue Flower Is Red': Relics and the Poeticizing of the Body,\\" Journal of Early Christian Studies 8.2 (2000), p. 228. The day on which Christian martyrs died is regarded as their dies natalis; see Calendar of saints. dies religiosus According to Festus, it was wrong (nefas) to undertake any action beyond attending to basic necessities on a day that was religiosus on the calendar. On these days, there were to be no marriages, political assemblies, or battles. Soldiers were not to be enlisted, nor journeys started. Nothing new was to be started, and no religious acts (res divinae) performed. Aulus Gellius said that dies religiosi were to be distinguished from those that were nefasti.H.H. Scullard, Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 45. dies vitiosus The phrase diem vitiare (\\"to vitiate a day\\") in augural practice meant that the normal activities of public business were prohibited on a given day, presumably by obnuntiatio, because of observed signs that indicated defect (morbus; see vitium).Cicero, Ad Atticum 4.9.1; Festus 268 in the edition of Lindsay; Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), pp. 2187‚Äì2188. Unlike a dies religiosus or a dies ater (\\"black day,\\" typically the anniversary of a calamity), a particular date did not become permanently vitiosus, with one exception. Some Roman calendars (fasti) produced under Augustus and up to the time of ClaudiusJ√∂rg R√ºpke, The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine: Time, History, and the Fasti, translated by David M.B. Richardson (Blackwell, 2011, originally published 1995 in German), pp. 151‚Äì152. The Fasti Maffeiani (= Degrassi, Inscriptiones Italiae 13.2.72) reads Dies vitios[us] ex s[enatus] c[onsulto], as noted by R√ºpke, Kalender und √ñffentlichkeit: Die Geschichte der Repr√§sentation und religi√∂sen Qualifikation von Zeit in Rom (De Gruyter, 1995), p. 436, note 36. The designation is also found in the Fasti Praenestini. mark January 14 as a dies vitiosus, a day that was inherently \\"vitiated\\". January 14 is the only day to be marked annually and officially by decree of the Roman senate (senatus consultum) as vitiosus. LInderski calls this \\"a very remarkable innovation.\\"Linderski, \\"The Augural Law,\\" p. 2188. One calendar, the Fasti Verulani (c. 17‚Äì37 AD), explains the designation by noting it was the dies natalis of Mark Antony, which the Greek historian and Roman senator Cassius Dio says had been declared ·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ± ŒºŒπŒ±œÅŒ¨ (hƒìmera miara) (= dies vitiosus) by Augustus.Cassius Dio 51.19.3; Linderski, \\"The Augural Law,\\" pp. 2187‚Äì2188. The emperor Claudius, who was the grandson of Antony, rehabilitated the day.Suetonius, Divus Claudius 11.3, with commentary by Donna W. Hurley, Suetonius: Divus Claudius (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 106. dirae The adjective dirus as applied to an omen meant \\"dire, awful.\\" It often appears in the feminine plural as a substantive meaning \\"evil omens.\\" Dirae were the worst of the five kinds of signs recognized by the augurs, and were a type of oblative or unsought sign that foretold disastrous consequences. The ill-fated departure of Marcus Crassus for the invasion of Parthia was notably attended by dirae (see Ateius Capito). In the interpretive etymology of ancient writers,Servius, note to Aeneid 4.453; Festus 69 (edition of Lindsay). dirae was thought to derive from dei irae, the grudges or anger of a god, that is, divine wrath. Dirae is an epithet for the Furies, and can also mean curses or imprecations,David Wardle, Cicero on Divination, Book 1 (Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 178, 182; Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), p. 2203. particularly in the context of magic and related to defixiones (curse tablets).William Warde Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922), p. 59; Georg Luck, Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006, 2nd ed.), passim. In explaining why Claudius felt compelled to ban the religion of the druids, SuetoniusThe phrase is Druidarum religionem ... dirae immanitatis (\\"the malevolent inhumanity of the religion of the druids\\"), where immanitas seems to be the opposite of humanitas as also evidenced among the Celts: Suetonius, Claudius 25, in the same passage containing one of the earliest mentions of Christianity as a threat. speaks of it as dirus, alluding to the practice of human sacrifice.P.A. Brunt, Roman Imperial Themes (Oxford University Press, 1990, 2001), p. 485 online. disciplina Etrusca Etruscan liver of Piacenza The collective body of knowledge pertaining to the doctrine, ritual practices, laws, and science of Etruscan religion and cosmology was known as the disciplina Etrusca.The phrase is used for instance by Servius, note to Aeneid 4.166. Divination was a particular feature of the disciplina. The Etruscan texts on the disciplina that were known to the Romans are of three kinds: the libri haruspicini (on haruspicy), the libri fulgurales (lightning), and the libri rituales (ritual).Massimo Pallottino, \\"The Doctrine and Sacred Books of the Disciplina Etrusca\\", Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), pp. 43‚Äì44. Nigidius Figulus, the Late Republican scholar and praetor of 58 BC, was noted for his expertise in the disciplina.Elizabeth Rawson, \\"Caesar, Etruria, and the Disciplina Etrusca\\", Journal of Roman Studies 68 (1978), p. 138. Extant ancient sources on the Etrusca disciplina include Pliny the Elder, Seneca, Cicero, Johannes Lydus, Macrobius and Festus. divus The adjective divus, feminine diva, is usually translated as \\"divine.\\" As a substantive, divus refers to a \\"deified\\" or divinized mortal. Both deus and divus derive from Indo-European *deywos, Old Latin deivos. Servius confirmsServius, note to Aeneid 5.45, also 12.139. that deus is used for \\"perpetual deities\\" (deos perpetuos), but divus for people who become divine (divos ex hominibus factos = gods who once were men). While this distinction is useful in considering the theological foundations of Imperial cult, it sometimes vanishes in practice, particularly in Latin poetry; Vergil, for instance, mostly uses deus and divus interchangeably. Varro and Ateius,Servius is unclear as to whether Lucius Ateius Praetextatus or Gaius Ateius Capito is meant. however, maintained that the definitions should be reversed.David Wardle, \\"Deus or Divus: The Genesis of Roman Terminology for Deified Emperors and a Philosopher's Contribution\\", in Philosophy and Power in the Graeco-Roman World (Oxford University Press, 2002), pp. 181‚Äì183. See also Imperial cult: Divus, deus and the numen. do ut des The formula do ut des (\\"I give that you might give\\") expresses the reciprocity of exchange between human being and deity, reflecting the importance of gift-giving as a mutual obligation in ancient society and the contractual nature of Roman religion. The gifts offered by the human being take the form of sacrifice, with the expectation that the god will return something of value, prompting gratitude and further sacrifices in a perpetuating cycle.J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion of the Romans (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 149 online. The do ut des principle is particularly active in magic and private ritual.Georg Luck, Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006), p. 479 online. Do ut des was also a judicial concept of contract law.Adolf Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law (Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, 1953, 2002), p. 414. In Pauline theology, do ut des was viewed as a reductive form of piety, merely a \\"business transaction\\", in contrast to God's unilateral grace (œáŒ¨œÅŒπœÇ, charis).James R. Harrison, Paul's Language of Grace in Its Graeco-Roman Context (C.B. Mohr, 2003), p. 284. See Charites for the ancient Greek goddesses known as the Graces. Max Weber, in The Sociology of Religion, saw it as \\"a purely formalistic ethic.\\"Max Weber, The Sociology of Religion (Beacon Press, 1963, 1991, originally published in German 1922), p. 82 online. In The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, however, √âmile Durkheim regarded the concept as not merely utilitarian, but an expression of \\"the mechanism of the sacrificial system itself\\" as \\"an exchange of mutually invigorating good deeds between the divinity and his faithful.\\"√âmile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (Oxford University Press, 2001 translation), p. 257 online. E effatio The verb effari, past participle effatus, means \\"to create boundaries (fines) by means of fixed verbal formulas.\\"Festus 146 (edition of Lindsay). Effatio is the abstract noun. It was one of the three parts of the ceremony inaugurating a templum (sacred space), preceded by the consulting of signs and the liberatio which \\"freed\\" the space from malign or competing spiritual influences and human effects.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), pp. 2156‚Äì2157. A site liberatus et effatus was thus \\"exorcized and available.\\"Robert Schilling, \\"Augurs and Augury,\\" Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 115. The result was a locus inauguratus (\\"inaugurated site\\"), the most common form of which was the templum.Daniel J. Gargola, Lands, Laws and Gods: Magistrates and Ceremony in the Regulation of Public Lands (University of North Carolina Press, 1995), p. 27. The boundaries had permanent markers (cippi or termini), and when these were damaged or removed, their effatio had to be renewed.Linderski, \\"Augural Law,\\" p. 2274. evocatio Victory presents an egg as a warrior attends in a pose of peace The \\"calling forth\\" or \\"summoning away\\" of a deity was an evocatio, from evoco, evocare, \\"summon.\\" The ritual was conducted in a military setting either as a threat during a siege or as a result of surrender, and aimed at diverting the favor of a tutelary deity from the opposing city to the Roman side, customarily with a promise of better-endowed cult or a more lavish temple.Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 41. As a tactic of psychological warfare, evocatio undermined the enemy's sense of security by threatening the sanctity of its city walls (see pomerium) and other forms of divine protection. In practice, evocatio was a way to mitigate otherwise sacrilegious looting of religious images from shrines.Nicholas Purcell, \\"On the Sacking of Corinth and Carthage\\", in Ethics and Rhetoric: Classical Essays for Donald Russell on His Seventy (Oxford University Press, 1995), pp. 140‚Äì142. Recorded examples of evocations include the transferral of Juno Regina (\\"Juno the Queen\\", originally Etruscan Uni) from Veii in 396 BC;Beard et al., Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook, pp. 41‚Äì42, with the passage from Livy, 5.21.1‚Äì7; Robert Turcan, The Cults of the Roman Empire (Blackwell, 1996, 2001, originally published in French 1992), p. 12; Robert Schilling, \\"Juno\\", Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p 131. the ritual performed by Scipio Aemilianus in 146 BC at the defeat of Carthage, involving Tanit (Juno Caelestis);Daniel J. Gargola, Lands, Laws, and Gods: Magistrates and Ceremonies in the Regulation of Public Lands in Republican Rome (University of North Carolina Press, 1995), p. 30. Elizabeth Rawson expresses doubts as to whether the evocatio of 146 BC occurred as such; see \\"Scipio, Laelius, Furius and the Ancestral Religion\\", Journal of Roman Studies 63 (1973) 161‚Äì174. and the dedication of a temple to an unnamed, gender- indeterminate deity at Isaura Vetus in Asia Minor in 75 BC.Evidenced by an inscription dedicated by an imperator Gaius Servilius, probably at the vowed temple; Beard et al., Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook, p. 248. Some scholars think that Vortumnus (Etruscan Voltumna) was brought by evocation to Rome in 264 BC as a result of M. Fulvius Flaccus's defeat of the Volsinii.As implied but not explicitly stated by Propertius, Elegy 4.2; Daniel P. Harmon, \\"Religion in the Latin Elegists\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16.3 (1986), pp. 1960‚Äì1961. In Roman myth, a similar concept motivates the transferral of the Palladium from Troy to Rome, where it served as one of the pignora imperii, sacred tokens of Roman sovereignty.Eric Orlin, Foreign Cults in Rome: Creating a Roman Empire (Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 37‚Äì38. Compare invocatio, the \\"calling on\\" of a deity. Formal evocations are known only during the Republic.Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 254. Other forms of religious assimilation appear from the time of Augustus, often in connection with the establishment of the Imperial cult in the provinces.Arnaldo Momigliano, On Pagans, Jews, and Christians (Wesleyan University Press, 1987), p. 178; Greg Woolf, Becoming Roman: The Origins of Provincial Civilization in Gaul (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 214. Evocatio, \\"summons\\", was also a term of Roman law without evident reference to its magico-religious sense.George Mousourakis, The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law (Ashgate, 2003), p. 339 online. exauguratio A site that had been inaugurated (locus inauguratus), that is, marked out through augural procedure, could not have its purpose changed without a ceremony of reversal.Daniel J. Gargola, Lands, Laws, and Gods: Magistrates and Ceremony in the Regulation of Public Lands (University of North Carolina Press, 1995), p. 27; Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), p. 2273. Removing a god from the premises required the correct ceremonial invocations.Clifford Ando, The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire (University of California Press, 2008), p. 184, citing Servius, note to Aeneid 2.351: \\"Pontifical law advises that unless Roman deities are called by their proper names, they cannot be exaugurated\\" (et iure pontificum cautum est, ne suis nominibus dii Romani appellarentur, ne exaugurari possint). When Tarquin rebuilt the temple district on the Capitoline, a number of deities were dislodged by exauguratio, though Terminus and Juventas \\"refused\\" and were incorporated into the new structure.Livy 5.54.7; Dionysius of Halicarnassus 3.69.5; J. Rufus Fears, \\"The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.17.2 (1981), p. 848. A distinction between the exauguratio of a deity and an evocatio can be unclear.Clifford Ando, \\"Exporting Roman Religion,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 442. The procedure was in either case rare, and was required only when a deity had to yield place to another, or when the site was secularized. It was not required when a site was upgraded, for instance, if an open-air altar were to be replaced with a temple building to the same god.Fay Glinister, \\"Sacred Rubbish,\\" in Religion in Archaic and Republican Rome and Italy: Evidence and Experience (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), p. 66. The term could also be used for removing someone from a priestly office (sacerdotium).J√∂rg R√ºpke, Fasti sacerdotum: A Prosopography of Pagan, Jewish, and Christian Religious Officials in the City of Rome, 300 BC to AD 499 (Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 530, 753. Compare inauguratio. eximius An adjective, \\"choice, select,\\" used to denote the high quality required of sacrificial victims: \\"Victims (hostiae) are called 'select' (eximiae) because they are selected (eximantur) from the herd and designated for sacrifice, or because they are chosen on account of their choice (eximia) appearance as offerings to divine entities (numinibus).\\"Macrobius, Saturnalia III 5, 6, quoting a passage from Veranius, De pontificalibus quaestionibus: eximias dictas hostias quae ad sacrificium destinatae eximantur e grege, vel quod eximia specie quasi offerendae numinibus eligantur. The adjective here is synonymous with egregius, \\"chosen from the herd (grex, gregis).\\"F. SiniSua cuique civitati religio Torino 2001 p. 197 Macrobius says it is specifically a sacerdotal term and not a \\"poetic epithet\\" (poeticum ·ºêœÄŒØŒ∏ŒµœÑŒøŒΩ). exta The exta were the entrails of a sacrificed animal, comprising in Cicero's enumeration the gall bladder (fel), liver (iecur), heart (cor), and lungs (pulmones).Cicero, De divinatione 2.12.29. According to Pliny (Natural History 11.186), before 274 BC the heart was not included among the exta. The exta were exposed for litation (divine approval) as part of Roman liturgy, but were \\"read\\" in the context of the disciplina Etrusca. As a product of Roman sacrifice, the exta and blood are reserved for the gods, while the meat (viscera) is shared among human beings in a communal meal. The exta of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot (olla or aula), while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers. When the deity's portion was cooked, it was sprinkled with mola salsa (ritually prepared salted flour) and wine, then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering; the technical verb for this action was porricere.Robert Schilling, \\"The Roman Religion\\", in Historia Religionum: Religions of the Past (Brill, 1969), vol. 1, pp. 471‚Äì472, and \\"Roman Sacrifice,\\" Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 79; John Scheid, An Introduction to Roman Religion (Indiana University Press, 2003, originally published in French 1998), p. 84. F fanaticus Fanaticus means \\"belonging to a fanum,\\" a shrine or sacred precinct.Georg Luck, Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006, 2nd ed.), p. 511. Fanatici as applied to people refers to temple attendants or devotees of a cult, usually one of the ecstatic or orgiastic religions such as that of Cybele (in reference to the Galli),Juvenal, Satire 2.110‚Äì114; Livy 37.9 and 38.18; Richard M. Crill, \\"Roman Paganism under the Antonines and Severans,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16.2 (1976), p. 31. Bellona-Ma,Juvenal, Satire 4.123; Stephen L. Dyson, Rome: A Living Portrait of an Ancient City (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010), pp. 228, 328; John E. Stambaugh, \\"The Functions of Roman Temples,\\" ANRW II.16.2 (1976), p. 593; Robert Turcan, The Cults of the Roman Empire (Blackwell, 1992, 2001 printing), p. 41. or perhaps Silvanus.Anonymous author of the Historia Augusta, Tacitus 17.1: Fanaticus quidam in Templo Silvani tensis membris exclamavit, as cited by Peter F. Dorcey, The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion (Brill, 1992), p. 90, with some due skepticism toward the source. Inscriptions indicate that a person making a dedication might label himself fanaticus, in the neutral sense of \\"devotee\\".CIL VI.490, 2232, and 2234, as cited by Stambaugh, \\"The Function of Roman Temples,\\" p. 593, note 275. Tacitus uses fanaticus to describe the troop of druids who attended on the Icenian queen Boudica.Fanaticum agmen, Tacitus, Annales 14.30. The word was often used disparagingly by ancient Romans in contrasting these more emotive rites to the highly scripted procedures of public religion,See for instance Cicero, De domo sua 105, De divinatione 2.118; and Horace's comparison of supposedly inspired poetic frenzy to the fanaticus error of religious mania (Ars Poetica 454); C.O. Brink, Horace on Poetry: Epistles Book II, The Letters to Augustus and Florus (Cambridge University Press, 1982), p. 357; Marten Stol, Epilepsy in Babylonia (Brill, 1993), p. 121 online. and later by early Christians to deprecate religions other than their own; hence the negative connotation of \\"fanatic\\" in English. Festus says that a tree struck by lightning is called fanaticus,Fanatica dicitur arbor fulmine icta, apud Paulus, p. 92M. a reference to the Romano-Etruscan belief in lightning as a form of divine sign.Festus s.v. delubrum p. 64 M; G. Colonna \\"Sacred Architecture and the Religion of the Etruscans\\" in N. Thomas De Grummond The Religion of the Etruscans 2006 p. 165 n. 59 The Gallic bishop Caesarius of Arles, writing in the 5th century, indicates that such trees retained their sanctity even up to his own time,S. 53.1, CCSL 103:233‚Äì234, as cited by Bernadotte Filotas, Pagan Survivals, Superstitions and Popular Cultures in Early Medieval Pastoral Literature (Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 2005), p. 68. and urged the Christian faithful to burn down the arbores fanatici. These trees either were located in and marked a fanum or were themselves considered a fanum. Caesarius is somewhat unclear as to whether the devotees regarded the tree itself as divine or whether they thought its destruction would kill the numen housed within it. Either way, even scarcity of firewood would not persuade them to use the sacred wood for fuel, a scruple for which he mocked them.\\"What a thing is that, that when those trees to which people make vows fall, no one carries wood from them home to use on the hearth! Behold the wretchedness and stupidity of mankind: they show honour to a dead tree and despite the commands of the living God; they do not dare to put the branches of a tree into the fire and by an act of sacrilege throw themselves headlong into hell\\": Caesarius of Arles, S. 54.5, CCSL 103:239, as quoted and discussed by Filotas, Pagan Survivals, p. 146. fanum A fanum is a plot of consecrated ground, a sanctuary,As for instance in Livy 10.37.15, where he says that the temple of Jupiter Stator, established by the wartime votum of the consul and general M. Atilius Regulus in the 290s BC, had already been vowed by Romulus, but had remained only a fanum, a site (locus) delineated by means of verbalized ritual (effatus) for a templum. and from that a temple or shrine built there.Roger D. Woodard, Indo-European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult (University of Illinois Press, 2006), p. 150 online. A fanum may be a traditional sacred space such as the grove (lucus) of Diana Nemorensis, or a sacred space or structure for non-Roman religions, such as an Iseum (temple of Isis) or Mithraeum. Cognates such as Oscan f√≠√≠sn√∫,F√≠√≠sn√∫ is the nominative form. Umbrian fesnaf-e,The form fesnaf-e is an accusative plural with an enclitic postposition. and Paelignian fesn indicate that the concept is shared by Italic peoples.Woodard, Indo-European Sacred Space, p. 150. The Greek temenos was the same concept. By the Augustan period, fanum, aedes, templum, and delubrum are scarcely distinguishable in usage,S.P. Oakley, A Commentary on Livy, Books 6‚Äì10 (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 378; Michel P.J. van den Hout, A Commentary on the Letters of M. Cornelius Fronto (Brill, 1999), p. 164. but fanum was a more inclusive and general term.Lawrence Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 2. The fanum, Romano-Celtic temple, or ambulatory temple of Roman Gaul was often built over an originally Celtic religious site, and its plan was influenced by the ritual architecture of earlier Celtic sanctuaries. The masonry temple building of the Gallo-Roman period had a central space (cella) and a peripheral gallery structure, both square.Patrice M√©niel, \\"Fanum and sanctuary,\\" in Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia (ABC-Clio, 2006), pp. 229, 733‚Äì734 online. Romano-Celtic fana of this type are found also in Roman Britain.See Romano-Celtic Temple Bourton Grounds in Great-Britain and Romano- British Temples The English word \\"profane\\" ultimately derives from Latin pro fano,T.F. Hoad, English Etymology, Oxford University Press 1993. p. 372a. \\"before, i.e. outside, the temple\\", \\"In front of the sanctuary,\\" hence not within sacred ground. fata deorum Fata deorum or the contracted form fata deum are the utterances of the gods; that is, prophecies.Servius, note to Aeneid 2.54; Nicholas Horsfall, Virgil, Aeneid 2: A Commentary (Brill, 2008), p. 91. These were recorded in written form, and conserved by the state priests of Rome for consultation. The fata are both \\"fate\\" as known and determined by the gods, or the expression of the divine will in the form of verbal oracles.Horsfall, Virgil, Aeneid 2, p. 91. Fata deum is a theme of the Aeneid, Virgil's national epic of Rome.Elisabeth Henry, The Vigour of Prophecy: A Study of Virgil's Aeneid (Southern Illinois University Press, 1989) passim. The Sibylline Books (Fata Sibyllina or Libri Fatales), composed in Greek hexameters, are an example of written fata. These were not Roman in origin but were believed to have been acquired in only partial form by Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. They were guarded by the priesthood of the decemviri sacris faciundis \\"ten men for carrying out sacred rites\\", later fifteen in number: quindecimviri sacris faciundis. No one read the books in their entirety; they were consulted only when needed. A passage was selected at random and its relevance to the current situation was a matter of expert interpretation.Jerzy Linderski, \\"Founding the City,\\" in Ten Years of the Agnes Kirsopp Lake Michels Lectures at Bryn Mawr College (Bryn Mawr Commentaries, 2006), p. 93. They were thought to contain fata rei publicae aeterna, \\"prophecies eternally valid for Rome\\".R.L. Rike, Apex Omnium: Religion in the Res Gestae of Ammianus (University of California Press, 1987), p. 123. They continued to be consulted throughout the Imperial period until the time of Christian hegemony. Augustus installed the Sibylline books in a special golden storage case under the statue of Apollo in the Temple of Apollo Palatinus.Cynthia White, \\"The Vision of Augustus,\\" Classica et Mediaevalia 55 (2004), p. 276. The emperor Aurelian chastised the senate for succumbing to Christian influence and not consulting the books.Rike, Apex Omnium, pp. 122‚Äì123. Julian consulted the books regarding his campaign against Persia, but departed before he received the unfavorable response of the college; Julian was killed and the Temple of Apollo Palatinus burned.Ammianus Marcellinus, Res gestae 23.1.7, as cited by Rike, Apex Omnium, p. 122, note 57; Sarolta A.

Fas is thus both distinguished from and linked to ius (plural iura), \\"law, lawfulness, justice,\\" as indicated by Vergil's often-cited phrase fas et iura sinunt, \\"fas and iura allow (it),\\" which Servius explains as \\"divine and human laws permit (it), for fas pertains to religion, iura to the human being.\\"Vergil, Georgics 1.269, with Servius's note: \\"divina humanaque iura permittunt: nam ad religionem fas, ad hominem iura pertinunt\\".

The Fasti Antiates Maiores, a pre-Julian calendar in a reconstructed drawing In Roman calendars, days marked F are dies fasti, when it is fas to attend to the concerns of everyday life.Schilling, Roman and European Mythologies, p. 92. In non- specialized usage, fas est may mean generally \\"it is permissible, it is right.\\" The etymology of fas is debated. It is more commonly associated with the semantic field of the verb for, fari, \\"to speak,\\"The Oxford Latin Dictionary (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprinting), entry on fas p. 676, considers the etymology dubious but leans toward for, fari. The Indo- Europeanist Emile Benveniste derives fas, as a form of divine speech, from the IE root *bhƒÅ (as cited by Schilling, Roman and European Mythologies, p. 93, note 4). an origin pressed by Varro.Varro, De Lingua Latina, 6.29, because on dies fasti the courts are in session and political speech may be practiced freely. Ovid pursues the connection between the dies fasti and permissible speech (fas est) in his calendrical poem the Fasti; see discussion by Carole E. Newlands, Playing with Time: Ovid and the Fasti (Cornell Studies in Classical Philology, 1995), p. 175 online. In other sources, both ancient and modern, fas is thought to have its origin in an Indo-European root meaning \\"to establish,\\" along with fanum and feriae.Dum√©zil holds that fas derives from the IE root *dhƒì (as noted by Schilling, Roman and European Mythologies, p. 93, note 4). One ancient tradition associated the etymology of fas with that of Themis as the \\"establisher\\". See Paulus, epitome of Festus, p. 505 (edition of Lindsay); Ausonius, Technopaegnion 8, and de diis 1. For the scholarship, see U. Coli, \\"Regnum\\" in Studia et documenta historiae et iuris 17 1951; C. Ferrini \\"Fas\\" in Nuovo Digesto Italiano p. 918; C.

Dumezil, La religion romaine archaique (Paris 1974), p. 144. See also Fasti and nefas. fasti A record or plan of official and religiously sanctioned events. All state and societal business must be transacted on dies fasti, \\"allowed days\\". The fasti were the records of all details pertaining to these events. The word was used alone in a general sense or qualified by an adjective to mean a specific type of record. Closely associated with the fasti and used to mark time in them were the divisions of the Roman calendar. The Fasti is also the title of a six-book poem by Ovid based on the Roman religious calendar. It is a major source for Roman religious practice, and was translated into English by J. G. Frazer. felix In its religious sense, felix means \\"blessed, under the protection or favour of the gods; happy.\\" That which is felix has achieved the pax divom, a state of harmony or peace with the divine world.H. Fugier Recherches sur l'expression du sacre' dans la langue latine Paris, 1963 It is rooted in Indo-European *dhe(i)l, meaning \\"happy, fruitful, productive, full of nourishment.\\" Related Latin words include femina, \\"woman\\" (a person who provides nourishment or suckles); felo, \\"to suckle\\"; and filius, \\"son\\" (a person suckled).W. W. Skeat Etymological Dictionary of the English Language New York 1963 sv felicity, feminine See also Felicitas, both an abstraction that expressed the quality of being felix and a deity of Roman state religion. feria A feria on the Roman calendar is a \\"free day\\", that is, a day in which no work was done. No court sessions were held, nor was any public business conducted. Employees were entitled to a day off, and even slaves were not obliged to work. These days were codified into a system of legal public holidays, the feriae publicae, which could be *stativae, \\"stationary, fixed\\", holidays which recurred on the same date each year; * conceptivae, recurring holidays for which the date depended on some other factor, usually the agrarian cycle. They included Compitalia, Paganalia, Sementivae and Latinae (compare the moveable Christian holiday of Easter); * imperativae, one-off holidays ordered to mark a special occasion, established with an act of auctority of a magistrate. In the Christian Roman Rite a feria is a weekday on which the faithful are required to attend Mass. The custom throughout Europe of holding markets on the same day gave rise to the word \\"fair\\" (Spanish Feria, Italian Fiera, Catalan Fira). festus In the Roman calendar, a dies festus is a festive or holy day, that is, a day dedicated to a deity or deities. On such days it was forbidden to undertake any profane activity, especially official or public business. All dies festi were thus nefasti. Some days, however, were not festi and yet might not be permissible as business days (fasti) for other reasons. The days on which profane activities were permitted are profesti.G. Dumezil La religion romaine archaique Paris 1974 part IV chapt. 2; Camillus: a study of Indo-European religion as Roman history (University of California Press, 1980), p. 214 online, citing Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.16.2. fetial The fetiales, or fetial priests. finis The finis (limit, border, boundary), plural fines, was an essential concept in augural practice, which was concerned with the definition of the templum. Establishing fines was an important part of a magistrate's duties.Livy I.18.9; Varro, De lingua latina V.143, VI.153, VII.8-9; Aulus Gellius XIII.14.1 (on the pomerium); Festus p. 488 L, tesca. Most scholars regard the finis as having been defined physically by ropes, trees, stones, or other markers, as were fields and property boundaries in general. It was connected with the god Terminus and his cult.Joseph Rykwert, The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy and the Ancient World (MIT Press, 1988, originally published 1976), pp. 106‚Äì107, 126‚Äì127; Wissowa, Religion und Kultus der R√∂mer (Munich 1912) 2nd pp. 136 ff.; G. Dumezil, La religion romaine archaique (Paris 1974) 2nd, pp. 210 ff.; Varro, De lingua latina V.21; Isidore, Origines XV.14.3; Paulus, Fest. epit. p. 505 L; Ovid, Fasti II 639 ff. flamen Flamen wearing the distinctive hat of his office, with the top point missing (3rd century AD) The fifteen flamines formed part of the College of Pontiffs. Each flamen served as the high priest to one of the official deities of Roman religion, and led the rituals relating to that deity. The flamines were regarded as the most ancient among the sacerdotes, as many of them were assigned to deities who dated back to the prehistory of Latium and whose significance had already become obscure by classical times. The archaic nature of the flamens is indicated by their presence among Latin tribes. They officiated at ceremonies with their head covered by a velum and always wore a filamen, thread, in contrast to public rituals conducted by Greek rite (ritus graecus) which were established later. Ancient authors derive the word flamen from the custom of covering the head with the filamen, but it may be cognate to Vedic bhraman. The distinctive headgear of the flamen was the apex. Fratres Arvales The \\"Brothers of the Field\\" were a college of priests whose duties were concerned with agriculture and farming. They were the most ancient religious sodalitas: according to tradition they were created by Romulus, but probably predated the foundation of Rome. G Gabinus The adjective gabinus describes an element of religion that the Romans attributed to practices from Gabii, a town of Latium with municipal status about 12 miles from Rome. The incorporation of Gabinian traditions indicates their special status under treaty with Rome. See cinctus gabinus and ager gabinus. H hostia Ritual implements The hostia was the offering, usually an animal, in a sacrifice. The word is used interchangeably with victima by Ovid and others, but some ancient authors attempt to distinguish between the two.Discussion and citation of ancient sources by Steven J. Green, Ovid, Fasti 1: A Commentary (Brill, 2004), pp. 159‚Äì160 online. Servius saysServius, note to Aeneid 1.334. that the hostia is sacrificed before battle, the victima afterward, which accords with Ovid's etymology in relating the \\"host\\" to the \\"hostiles\\" or enemy (hostis), and the \\"victim\\" to the \\"victor.\\"Hostibus a domitis hostia nomen habet (\\"the hostia gets its name from the 'hostiles' that have been defeated\\"), Ovid, Fasti 1.336; victima quae dextra cecidit victrice vocatur (\\"the victim which is killed by the victor's right hand is named [from that act]\\"), 1.335. The difference between the victima and hostia is elsewhere said to be a matter of size, with the hostia smaller (minor). Hostiae were also classified by age: lactentes were young enough to be still taking milk, but had reached the age to be purae; bidentes had reached two years of ageMacrobius Sat. VI 9, 5-7; Varro Ling. Lat. V or had the two longer (bi-) incisor teeth (dentes) that are an indication of age.Macrobius Sat. VI 9, 7; Festus s.v. bidentes p.33 M Hostiae could be classified in various ways. A hostia consultatoria was an offering for the purpose of consulting with a deity, that is, in order to know the will of a deity; the hostia animalis, to increase the force (mactare) of the deity.Macrobius, Saturnalia III 5, 1 ff. The victim might also be classified by occasion and timing. The hostia praecidanea was an \\"anticipatory offering\\" made the day before a sacrifice.Nathan Rosenstein, Imperatores Victi: Military Defeat and Aristocratic Competition in the Middle and Late Republic (University of California Press, 1990), p. 64. It was an advance atonement \\"to implore divine indulgence\\" should an error be committed on the day of the formal sacrifice.Robert Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome (Routledge, 2001; originally published in French 1998), p. 9. A preliminary pig was offered as a praecidanea the day before the harvest began.Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 39. The hostia praecidanea was offered to Ceres a day in advance of a religious festival (sacrum, before the beginning of the harvest) in expiation for negligences in the duties of piety towards the deceased. The hostia praesentanaea was a pig offered to Ceres during a part of the funeral rites conducted within sight of the deceased, whose family was thereby ritually absolved.Veranius, Iur. 7: praesentanaea porca dicitur ... quae familiae purgandae causa Cereris immolatur, quod pars quaedam eius sacrificii fit in conspectu mortui eius, cuius funus instituitur. A hostia succidanea was offered at any rite after the first sacrifice had failed owing to a ritual impropriety (vitium).Aulus Gellius Noctes Atticae IV 6, 3-10 for hostia succidanea and praecidanea; also Festus p. 250 L. s. v. praecidanea hostia; Festus p. 298 L. s.v. praesentanea hostia. Gellius's passage implies a conceptual connexion between the hostia praecidanea and the feriae succidaneae, though this is not explicated. Scholarly interpretations thus differ on what the feriae praecidaneae were: cf. A. Bouch√©-Leclercq Dictionnaire des antiquit√©s grecques et romaines III Paris 1898 s. v Inauguratio p. 440 and n. 1; G. Wissowa Religion und Kultus der R√∂mer M√ºnchen 1912 p.438 f.; L. Schmitz in W. Smith A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities London 1875 s. v. feriae; P. Catalano Contributi allo studio del diritto augurale Torino 1960 p. 352. Compare piaculum, an expiatory offering. Hostia is the origin of the word \\"host\\" for the Eucharistic sacrament of the Western Church; see Sacramental bread: Catholic Church. See also votum, a dedication or a vow of an offering to a deity as well as that which fulfilled the vow. I inauguratio A rite performed by augurs by which the concerned person received the approval of the gods for his appointment or their investiture. The augur would ask for the appearance of certain signs (auspicia impetrativa) while standing beside the appointee on the auguraculum. In the Regal period, inauguratio concerned the king and the major sacerdotes.Cicero, De legibus ii 8,20; Dionysius Halicarnassus II 22,3. After the establishment of the Republic, the rex sacrorum,Livy XXVII 36, 5; XL 42, 8-10; Aulus Gellius XV 17, 1 the three flamines maiores,Gaius I 130; III 114; Livy XXVII 8,4; XLI 28, 7; XXXVII 47, 8; XXIX 38, 6;XLV 15,19; Macrobius II 13, 11; the augurs, and the pontiffsCicero, Brutus 1; Livy XXVII 36, 5; XXX 26, 10; Dionysius Halicarnassus II 73, 3. all had to be inaugurated. The term may also refer to the ritual establishing of the augural templum and the tracing of the wall of a new city. indigitamenta The indigitamenta were lists of gods maintained by the College of Pontiffs to assure that the correct divine names were invoked for public prayers. It is sometimes unclear whether these names represent distinct minor entities, or epithets pertaining to an aspect of a major deity's sphere of influence, that is, an indigitation, or name intended to \\"fix\\" or focalize the local action of the god so invoked.William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London, 1908), p. 89. Varro is assumed to have drawn on direct knowledge of the lists in writing his theological books, as evidenced by the catalogues of minor deities mocked by the Church Fathers who used his workIn particular, Book 14 of the non-extant Antiquitates rerum divinarum; see Lipka, Roman Gods, pp. 69‚Äì70. as a reference.W.R. Johnson, \\"The Return of Tutunus\\", Arethusa (1992) 173‚Äì179; Fowler, Religious Experience, p. 163. Wissowa, however, asserted that Varro's lists were not indigitamenta, but di certi, gods whose function could still be identified with certainty; Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (unknown edition), vol. 13, p. 218 online. See also Kurt Latte, Roemische Religionsgeschichte (Munich, 1960), pp. 44-45. Another source is likely to have been the non-extant work De indigitamentis of Granius Flaccus, Varro's contemporary.Lactantius, Div. inst. 1.6.7; Censorinus 3.2; Arnaldo Momigliano, \\"The Theological Efforts of the Roman Upper Classes in the First Century B.C.\\", Classical Philology 79 (1984), p. 210. Not to be confused with the di indigetes. invocatio The addressing of a deity in a prayer or magic spell is the invocatio, from invoco, invocare, \\"to call upon\\" the gods or spirits of the dead.Georg Luck, Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006, 2nd ed.), p. 513. The efficacy of the invocatio depends on the correct naming of the deity, which may include epithets, descriptive phrases, honorifics or titles, and arcane names. The list of names (nomina) is often extensive, particularly in magic spells; many prayers and hymns are composed largely of invocations.Matthias Klinghardt, \\"Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion\\", Numen 46 (1999), pp. 44‚Äì45; Frances Hickson Hahn, \\"Performing the Sacred: Prayers and Hymns\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 240; Nicole Belayche, \\"Religious Actors in Daily Life: Practices and Shared Beliefs\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion, p. 279. The name is invoked in either the vocativeThe vocative is the grammatical case used only for \\"calling\\" or invoking, that is, hailing or addressing someone paratactically. or the accusative case.G√°bor Betegh, The Derveni Papyrus: Cosmology, Theology and Interpretation (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 137. In specialized usage pertaining to augural procedure, invocatio is a synonym for precatio, but specifically aimed at averting mala, evil occurrences.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), pp. 2253 Compare evocatio. The equivalent term in ancient Greek religion is epiklesis.Luck, Arcana Mundi, pp. 497, 498. Pausanias distinguished among the categories of theonym proper, poetic epithet, the epiclesis of local cult, and an epiclesis that might be used universally among the Greeks.Pausanias gave specific examples in regard to Poseidon (7.21.7); Claude Calame, \\"The Homeric Hymns as Poetic Offerings: Musical and Ritual Relationships with the Gods,\\" in The Homeric Hymns: Interpretive Essays (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 338. Epiclesis remains in use by some Christian churches for the invocation of the Holy Spirit during the Eucharistic prayer. ius Ius is the Latin word for justice, right, equity, fairness and all which came to be understood as the sphere of law. It is defined in the opening words of the Digesta with the words of Celsus as \\"the art of that which is good and fair\\" and similarly by Paulus as \\"that which is always just and fair\\".A. Berger Encyclopedical Dictionary of Roman Law Philadelphia 1968 sv. ius The polymath Varro and the jurist GaiusInst. 2, 2 ap. Dig. 1, 8, 1: Summa itaque rerum divisio in duos articulos diducitur: nam aliae sunt divini iuris, aliae humani, 'thus the highest division of things is reduced into two articlesÔºösome belong to divine right, some to human right'. consider the distinction between divine and human ius essentialF.Sini Bellum nefandum Sassari 1991 p. 110 but divine order is the source of all laws, whether natural or human, so the pontifex is considered the final judge (iudex) and arbiter.In Festus: ...iudex atque arbiter habetur rerum divinarum humanarumque: 'he is considered to be the judge and arbiter of things divine and human'... his authority stems from his regal (originally king Numa's) investiture.

Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 105. or \\"divine law,\\" particularly in regard to the gods' rights pertaining to their \\"property,\\" that which is rightfully theirs.J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion of the Romans (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 130, citing Gaius, Institutes 2.1‚Äì9. Recognition of the ius divinum was fundamental to maintaining right relations between human beings and their deities. The concern for law and legal procedure that was characteristic of ancient Roman society was also inherent in Roman religion.William Warde Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922), p. 122ff. See also pax deorum. L lectisternium lex The word lex (plural leges) derives from the Indo-European root *leg, as do the Latin verbs lego, legare, ligo, ligare (\\"to appoint, bequeath\\") and lego, legere (\\" to gather, choose, select, discern, read\\": cf. also Greek verb legein \\"to collect, tell, speak\\"), and the abstract noun religio.W.W. Skeat, Etymological dictionary of the English Language entries on legal, legion, diligent, negligent, religion. Parties to legal proceedings and contracts bound themselves to observance by the offer of sacrifice to witnessing deities.For example in Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 1.24.7, Jupiter is called on to hear the oath. Even though the word lex underwent the frequent semantic shift in Latin towards the legal area, its original meaning of set, formulaic words was preserved in some instances. Some cult formulae are leges: an augur's request for particular signs that would betoken divine approval in an augural rite (augurium), or in the inauguration of magistrates and some sacerdotes is named legum dictio.Serv. in Aen. III, 89: legum here is understood as the uttering of a set of fixed, binding conditions. The formula quaqua lege volet (\\"by whatever lex, i.e. wording he wishes\\") allowed a cult performer discretion in his choice of ritual words.M. Morani \\"Lat. 'sacer'...\\" Aevum LV 1981 p. 38 n.22 The leges templi regulated cult actions at various temples.For example, those dated to 58 BC, relating to the temple of Jupiter Liber at Furfo: CIL IX 3513G. Dumezil la religion romaine archaic Paris, 1974. In civil law, ritualised sets of words and gestures known as legis actiones were in use as a legal procedure in civil cases; they were regulated by custom and tradition (mos maiorum) and were thought to involve protection of the performers from malign or occult influences.P. Noailles RH 19/20 (1940/41) 1, 27 ff; A. Magdelain De la royaut√© et du droit des Romaines (Rome, 1995) chap. II, III Libatio depicted on a drawing of a coin libatio Libation (Latin libatio, Greek spondai) was one of the simplest religious acts, regularly performed in daily life. At home, a Roman who was about to drink wine would pour the first few drops onto the household altar.Paul Veyne, The Roman Empire (Harvard University Press, 1987), p. 213. The drink offering might also be poured on the ground or at a public altar. Milk and honey, water, and oil were also used.H.S. Versnel, Transition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual (Brill, 1993, 1994), pp. 62‚Äì63. liberatio The liberatio (from the verb liberare, \\"to free\\") was the \\"liberating\\" of a place (locus) from \\"all unwanted or hostile spirits and of all human influences,\\" as part of the ceremony inaugurating the templum (sacred space). It was preceded by the consulting of signs and followed by the effatio, the creation of boundaries (fines).Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), pp. 2156‚Äì2157, 2248. A site liberatus et effatus was \\"exorcized and available\\" for its sacred purpose.Robert Schilling, \\"Augurs and Augury,\\" in Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 116. libri augurales The augural books (libri augurales) represented the collective, core knowledge of the augural college. Some scholarsF. Sini Documenti sacerdotali di Roma antica Sassari, 1983; S. Tondo Leges regiae e paricidas Firenze, 1973; E. Peruzzi Origini di Roma II consider them distinct from the commentarii augurum (commentaries of the augurs) which recorded the collegial acts of the augurs, including the decreta and responsa.Francesco Sini, Documenti sacerdotali di Roma antica. I. Libri e documenti Sassari, 1983, IV, 10, p. 175 ff. The books were central to the practice of augury. They have not survived, but Cicero, who was an augur himself, offers a summary in De LegibusCicero, De Legibus (\\"On Laws\\"), 2, 21. that represents \\"precise dispositions based certainly on an official collection edited in a professional fashion.\\"M. Van Den Bruwaene, \\"Precison sur la loi religieuse du de leg. II, 19-22 de Ciceron\\" in Helikon 1 (1961) p.89. libri pontificales The libri pontificales (pontifical books) are core texts in Roman religion, which survive as fragmentary transcripts and commentaries. They may have been partly annalistic, part priestly; different Roman authors refer to them as libri and commentarii (commentaries), described by Livy as incomplete \\"owing to the long time elapsed and the rare use of writing\\" and by Quintillian as unintelligibly archaic and obscure. The earliest were credited to Numa, second king of Rome, who was thought to have codified the core texts and principles of Rome's religious and civil law (ius divinum and ius civile).F. Sini Documenti sacerdotali di Roma antica I. Libri e commentari Sassari 1983 p. 22; S. Tondo Leges regiae e paricidas Firenze, 1973, p.20-21; R.

See also commentarii pontificum. litatio In animal sacrifice, the litatio followed on the opening up of the body cavity for the inspection of the entrails (inspicere exta). Litatio was not a part of divinatory practice as derived from the Etruscans (see extispicy and Liver of Piacenza), but a certification according to Roman liturgy of the gods' approval. If the organs were diseased or defective, the procedure had to be restarted with a new victim (hostia). The importance of litatio is illustrated by an incident in 176 BCLivy 41.14‚Äì15. when the presiding consuls attempted to sacrifice an ox, only to find that its liver had been inexplicably consumed by a wasting disease. After three more oxen failed to pass the test, the senate's instructions were to keep sacrificing bigger victims until litatio could be obtained.Robert Schilling, \\"Roman Sacrifice\\", Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 79. The point was not that those sacrificing had to make sure that the victim was perfect inside and out; rather, the good internal condition of the animal was evidence of divine acceptance of the offering. The need for the deity to approve and accept (litare) underscores that the reciprocity of sacrifice (do ut des) was not to be taken for granted.J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion of the Romans (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), pp. 149‚Äì150. lituus Lituus and jug on the reverse of a coin The distinctively curved staff of an augur, or a similarly curved war trumpet. On Roman coins, the lituus is frequently accompanied by a ritual jug or pitcher to indicate that either the moneyer or person honored on the obverse was an augur. lucus In religious usage, a lucus was a grove or small wooded area considered sacred to a divinity. Entrance might be severely restricted: PaulusPaulus Festi epitome p. 57 L s.v. capitalis lucus explains that a capitalis lucus was protected from human access under penalty of death. Leges sacratae (laws for the violation of which the offender is outlawed) concerning sacred groves have been found on cippi at Spoleto in Umbria and Lucera in Apulia.CIL I 2nd 366; XI 4766; CIL I2 401, IX 782; R. Del Ponte, \\"Santit√† delle mura e sanzione divina\\" in Diritto e Storia 3 2004. See also nemus. ludi Ludi were games held as part of religious festivals, and some were originally sacral in nature. These included chariot racing and the venatio, or staged animal-human blood sport that may have had a sacrificial element. Luperci The \\"wolf priests\\", organized into two colleges and later three, who participated in the Lupercalia. The most famous person to serve as a lupercus was Mark Antony. lustratio A ritual of purification which was held every five years under the jurisdiction of censors in Rome. Its original meaning was purifying by washing in water (Lat. lustrum from verb luo, \\"I wash in water\\"). The time elapsing between two subsequent lustrations being of five years the term lustrum took up the meaning of a period of five year.W.W. Skeat Etymological Dictionary of the English Language New York 1973 s.v. lustration M manubia Zeus (Etruscan Tinia, Roman Jupiter) holding a three-pronged lightning bolt, between Apollo and Hera/Juno (red-figure calyx-krater from Etruria, 420-400 BC) Manubia is a technical term of the Etruscan discipline, and refers to the power of a deity to wield lightning, represented in divine icons by a lightning bolt in the hand. It may be either a Latinized word from Etruscan or less likely a formation from manus, \\"hand,\\" and habere, \\"to have, hold.\\"Stefan Weinstock, \\"Libri fulgurales,\\" Papers of the British School at Rome 19 (1951), p. 125. It is not apparently related to the more common Latin word manubiae meaning \\"booty (taken by a general in war).\\"Weinstock, p. 125. Seneca uses the term in an extended discussion of lightning.Seneca, Naturales Questiones 2.41.1. Jupiter, as identified with Etruscan Tinia,Massimo Pallottino, \\"The Doctrine and Sacred Books of the Disciplina Etrusca,\\" Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 44. held three types of manubiaeAccording to Seneca, NQ 2.41.1.

Stefan Weinstock describes these as: # mild, or \\"perforating\\" lightning; # harmful or \\"crushing\\" lightning, which is sent on the advice of the twelve Di Consentes and occasionally does some good; # destructive or \\"burning\\" lightning, which is sent on the advice of the di superiores et involuti (hidden gods of the \\"higher\\" sphere) and changes the state of public and private affairs.Weinstock, p. 127. See also The Religion of the Etruscans, pp. 40‚Äì41, where an identification of the dii involuti with the Favores Opertaneii (\\"Secret Gods of Favor\\") referred to by Martianus Capella is proposed. Jupiter makes use of the first type of beneficial lightning to persuade or dissuade.Georges Dum√©zil, La religion romaine archa√Øque (Paris 1974), pp. 630 and 633 (note 3), drawing on Seneca, NQ 2.41.1‚Äì2 and 39. Books on how to read lightning were one of the three main forms of Etruscan learning on the subject of divination.Pallottino, \\"Doctrine and Sacred Books\\", pp. 43‚Äì44. miraculum One of several words for portent or sign, miraculum is a non-technical term that places emphasis on the observer's response (mirum, \\"a wonder, marvel\\").Auguste Bouch√©-Leclercq, Histoire de la divination dans l'antiquit√©: Divination hell√©nique et divination italique (J√©r√¥me Millon, 2003 reprint), p. 873; T.P. Wiseman, \\"History, Poetry, and Annales\\", in Clio and the Poets: Augustan Poetry and the Traditions of Ancient Historiography (Brill, 2002), p. 359 \\"awe and amazement are the result, not the cause, of the miraculum. Livy uses the word miraculum, for instance, to describe the sign visited upon Servius Tullius as a child, when divine flames burst forth from his head and the royal household witnessed the event.Livy 1.39. Compare monstrum, ostentum, portentum, and prodigium. Miraculum is the origin of the English word \\"miracle.\\" Christian writers later developed a distinction between miracula, the true forms of which were evidence of divine power in the world, and mere mirabilia, things to be marveled at but not resulting from God's intervention. \\"Pagan\\" marvels were relegated to the category of mirabilia and attributed to the work of demons.George Williamson, \\"Mucianus and a Touch of the Miraculous: Pilgrimage and Tourism in Roman Asia Minor\\", in Seeing the Gods: Pilgrimage in Graeco-Roman and Early Christian Antiquity (Oxford University Press, 2005, 2007), p. 245 online. Emmer wheat, used for mola salsa mola salsa Flour mixed with salt was sprinkled on the forehead and between the horns of sacrificial victims, as well as on the altar and in the sacred fire. This mola salsa (salted flour) was prepared ritually from toasted wheat or emmer, spelt, or barley by the Vestals, who thus contributed to every official sacrifice in Rome.Ariadne Staples, From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion (Routledge, 1998), pp. 154‚Äì155. Servius uses the words pius and castus to describe the product.Servius, note to Eclogue 8.82: The mola was so fundamental to sacrifice that \\"to put on the mola\\" (Latin immolare) came to mean \\"to sacrifice.\\" Its use was one of the numerous religious traditions ascribed to Numa, the Sabine second king of Rome.Fernando Navarro Antol√≠n, Lygdamus. Corpus Tibullianum III.1‚Äì6: Lygdami Elegiarum Liber (Brill, 1996), pp. 272‚Äì272 online. monstrum A monstrum is a sign or portent that disrupts the natural order as evidence of divine displeasure.David Wardle, Cicero on Divination, Book 1 (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 102. The word monstrum is usually assumed to derive, as Cicero says, from the verb monstro, \\"show\\" (compare English \\"demonstrate\\"), but according to Varro it comes from moneo, \\"warn.\\"Varro as recorded by Servius, note to Aeneid 3.336, cited by Wardle, Cicero on Divination, p. 330 online. Because a sign must be startling or deviant to have an impact, monstrum came to mean \\"unnatural event\\"Philip R. Hardie, Virgil: Aeneid, Book IX (Cambridge University Press, 1994, reprinted 2000), p. 97. or \\"a malfunctioning of nature.\\"Mary Beagon, \\"Beyond Comparison: M. Sergius, Fortunae victor\\", in Philosophy and Power in the Graeco-Roman World: Essays in Honour of Miriam Griffin (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 127. Suetonius said that \\"a monstrum is contrary to nature we are familiar with, like a snake with feet or a bird with four wings.\\"As cited by Wardle, Cicero on Divination, p. 330. The Greek equivalent was teras.Beagon, \\"Beyond Comparison\\", in Philosophy and Power, p. 127. The English word \\"monster\\" derived from the negative sense of the word. Compare miraculum, ostentum, portentum, and prodigium. In one of the most famous uses of the word in Latin literature, the Augustan poet Horace calls Cleopatra a fatale monstrum, something deadly and outside normal human bounds.Mich√®le Lowrie, Horace's Narrative Odes (Oxford University Press, 1997), pp. 151‚Äì154. Cicero calls Catiline monstrum atque prodigiumCicero, In Catilinam 2.1. and uses the phrase several times to insult various objects of his attacks as depraved and beyond the human pale. For Seneca, the monstrum is, like tragedy, \\"a visual and horrific revelation of the truth.\\"Gregory A. Staley, Seneca and the Idea of Tragedy (Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 80, 96, 109, 113 et passim. mundus Literally \\"the world\\", also a pit supposedly dug and sealed by Romulus as part of Rome's foundation rites. Its interpretation is problematic; it was normally sealed, and was ritually opened only on three occasions during the year. Still, in the most ancient Fasti, these days were marked C(omitiales)L. Banti; G. Dum√©zil La religion romaine archa√Øque Paris 1974,It. tr. p. 482-3. (days when the Comitia met) suggesting the idea that the whole ritual was a later Greek import.M. Humm, \\"Le mundus et le Comitium : repr√©sentations symboliques de l'espace de la cit√©,\\" Histoire urbaine, 2, 10, 2004. French language, full preview. However Cato and Varro as quoted by Macrobius considered them religiosi.Dies religiosi were marked by the gods as inauspicious, so in theory, no official work should have been done, but it was not a legally binding religious the rule. G. Dum√©zil above. When opened, the pit served as a cache for offerings to underworld deities, particularly Ceres, goddess of the fruitful earth. It offered a portal between the upper and lower worlds; its shape was said to be an inversion of the dome of the upper heavens.Festus p. 261 L2, citing Cato's commentaries on civil law. An inscription at Capua names a sacerdos Cerialis mundalis (CIL X 3926). For the connection between deities of agriculture and the underworld, see W. Warde Fowler, \\"Mundus Patet\\" in Journal of Roman Studies, 2, (1912), pp.25‚Äì33 N nefandum An adjective derived from nefas (following). The gerund of verb fari, to speak, is commonly used to form derivate or inflected forms of fas. See Vergil's fandi as genitive of fas. This use has been invoked to support the derivation of fas from IE root *bha, Latin fari. nefas Any thing or action contrary to divine law and will is nefas (in archaic legalese, ne (not) ... fas).A. Guarino L'ordinamento giuridico romano Napoli, 1980, p. 93. Nefas forbids a thing as religiously and morally offensive, or indicates a failure to fulfill a religious duty.Olga Tellegen-Couperus, A Short History of Roman Law, Routledge, 1993. pp17-18. It might be nuanced as \\"a religious duty not to\\", as in Festus' statement that \\"a man condemned by the people for a heinous action is sacer\\" ‚Äî that is, given over to the gods for judgment and disposal ‚Äî \\"it is not a religious duty to execute him, but whoever kills him will not be prosecuted\\".Festus p. 424 L: At homo sacer is est, quem populus iudicavit ob maleficium; neque fas est eum immolari, sed qui occidit, parricidi non damnatur. Livy records that the patricians opposed legislation that would allow a plebeian to hold the office of consul on the grounds that it was nefas: a plebeian, they claimed, would lack the arcane knowledge of religious matters that by tradition was a patrician prerogative. The plebeian tribune Gaius Canuleius, whose lex it was, retorted that it was arcane because the patricians kept it secret.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 4.3.9. nefastus Usually found with dies (singular or plural), as dies nefasti, days on which official transactions were forbidden on religious grounds. See also nefas, fasti and fas. nemus Nemus, plural nemora, was one of four Latin words that meant \\"forest, woodland, woods.\\" Lucus is more strictly a sacred grove,Paul Roche, Lucan: De Bello Civili, Book 1 (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 296. as defined by Servius as \\"a large number of trees with a religious significance\\",Servius, note to Aeneid 1.310, arborum multitudo cum religione. and distinguished from the silva, a natural forest; saltus, territory that is wilderness; and a nemus, an arboretum that is not consecrated (but compare Celtic nemeton).J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion of the Romans (Polity Press, 2007), p. 275, noting that he finds Servius's distinction \\"artificial.\\" In Latin poetry, a nemus is often a place conducive to poetic inspiration, and particularly in the Augustan period takes on a sacral aura.Fernando Navarro Antolin, Lygdamus: Corpus Tibullianum III.1‚Äì6, Lygdami Elegiarum Liber (Brill, 1996), p. 127‚Äì128. Named nemora include: * The nemus of Anna Perenna.Martial, 4.64.17, as cited by Robert Schilling, \\"Anna Perenna,\\" Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 112. * Nemus Caesarum, dedicated to the memory of Augustus's grandsons Gaius and Lucius.Stephen L. Dyson, Rome: A Living Portrait of an Ancient City (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010), p. 147. *The nemus Aricinum sacred to Diana, Egeria and Virbius. nuntiatio The chief responsibility of an augur was to observe signs (observatio) and to report the results (nuntiatio).Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), pp. 2159‚Äì2160, 2168, et passim. The announcement was made before an assembly. A passage in Cicero states that the augur was entitled to report on the signs observed before or during an assembly and that the magistrates had the right to watch for signs (spectio) as well as make the announcement (nuntiatio) prior to the conducting of public business, but the exact significance of Cicero's distinction is a matter of scholarly debate.S.W. Rasmussen, Public Portents in Republican Rome' online. O obnuntiatio Obnuntiatio was a declaration of unfavourable signs by an augur in order to suspend, cancel or postpone a proposed course of action. The procedure could be carried out only by an official who had the right to observe omens (spectio).W. Jeffrey Tatum, The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher (University of North Carolina Press, 1999) p. 127. The only source for the term is Cicero, a conservative politician and himself an augur, who refers to it in several speeches as a religious bulwark against popularist politicians and tribunes. Its details and workings are unknown; it may have derived from a radical intervention into traditional augural law of a civil Lex Aelia Fufia, proposed by dominant traditionalists in an attempt to block the passing of popular laws and used from around the 130s BC. Legislation by Clodius as Tribune of the plebs in 58 BC was aimed at ending the practice,Beard, M., Price, S., North, J., Religions of Rome: Volume 1, a History, illustrated, Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp 109-10. or at least curtailing its potential for abuse; obnuntiatio had been exploited the previous year as an obstructionist tactic by Julius Caesar's consular colleague Bibulus. That the Clodian law had not deprived all augurs or magistrates of the privilege is indicated by Mark Antony's use of obnuntatio in early 44 BC to halt the consular election.J.P.V.D. Balsdon, \\"Roman History, 58‚Äì56 B.C.: Three Ciceronian Problems\\", Journal of Roman Studies 47 (1957) 16‚Äì16. observatio Observatio was the interpretation of signs according to the tradition of the \\"Etruscan discipline\\", or as preserved in books such as the libri augurales. A haruspex interpreted fulgura (thunder and lightning) and exta (entrails) by observatio. The word has three closely related meanings in augury: the observing of signs by an augur or other diviner; the process of observing, recording, and establishing the meaning of signs over time; and the codified body of knowledge accumulated by systematic observation, that is, \\"unbending rules\\" regarded as objective, or external to an individual's observation on a given occasion. Impetrative signs, or those sought by standard augural procedure, were interpreted according to observatio; the observer had little or no latitude in how they might be interpreted. Observatio might also be applicable to many oblative or unexpected signs. Observatio was considered a kind of scientia, or \\"scientific\\" knowledge, in contrast to coniectura, a more speculative \\"art\\" or \\"method\\" (ars) as required by novel signs.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), pp. 2232‚Äì2234, 2237‚Äì2241. omen An omen, plural omina, was a sign intimating the future, considered less important to the community than a prodigium but of great importance to the person who heard or saw it.The etymology is debated. The older Latin form is osmen\\", which may have meant \\"an utterance\\"; see W. W. Skeat Etymological Dictionary of the English Language sv omen New York 1963. It has also been connected to an ancient Hittite exclamation ha (\\"it's true\\"); see R. Bloch Les prodiges dans l'antiquite' - Rome Paris 1968; It. tr. Rome 1978 p. 74, and E. Benveniste \\"Hittite et Indo-Europeen. Etudes comparatives\\" in Bibl. arch. et hist. de l'Institut francais a, Arch. de Stambul V, 1962, p.10. Omens could be good or bad. Unlike prodigies, bad omens were never expiated by public rites but could be reinterpreted, redirected or otherwise averted. Some time around 282 BC, a diplomatic insult formally \\"accepted as omen\\" was turned against Tarentum and helped justify its conquest. After a thunderclap cost Marcellus his very brief consulship (215 BC) he took care to avoid sight of possible bad omens that might affect his plans.See Veit Rosenberger, in R√ºpke, J√∂rg (Editor), A Companion to Roman Religion, Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p.298; citing Cicero, De Divinatione, 2.77. Bad omens could be more actively dealt with, by countersigns or spoken formulae. Before his campaign against Perseus of Macedon, the consul L Aemilius Paullus was said to have heard of the death of Perseus, his daughter's puppy. He accepted the omen and defeated King Perseus at the Battle of Pydna (168 BC).Donald Lateiner, \\"Signifying Names and Other Ominous Accidental Utterances in Classical Historiography\\", Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies, (2005), pp.51-55, 45, 49.. Paullus is said to have accepted the omen with the words, \\"accipio, mea filia, omen.\\" (\\"I accept the omen, my daughter\\"). In 217 BC the consul Gaius Flaminius \\"disregarded his horse's collapse, the chickens, and yet other omens, before his disaster at Lake Trasimene\\".Donald Lateiner, \\"Signifying Names and Other Ominous Accidental Utterances in Classical Historiography\\", Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies, (2005), 49. Licinius Crassus took ship for Syria despite an ominous call of \\"Cauneas!\\" (\\"Caunean figs!\\"), which might be heard as \\"Cave ne eas!\\" (\\"Beware, don't go!\\")'. He was killed on campaign. Cicero saw these events as merely coincidental; only the credulous could think them ominous.\\"If we are going to accept chance utterances of this kind as omens, we had better look out when we stumble, or break a shoe-string, or sneeze!\\" Cicero De Divinatione 2.84: Loeb translation (1923) online at Bill Thayer's site . In Pliny, Historia Naturalis, 15.83: ex hoc genere sunt, ut diximus, cottana et caricae quaeque conscendendi navem adversus Parthos omen fecere M. Crasso venales praedicantes voce, Cavneae. Teubner-Mahoff edn. transcribed at Bill Thayer's site By his time, however, politicians, military magnates and their supporters actively circulated tales of excellent omens that attended their births and careers. See also abominari and signum. ostentarium One form of arcane literature was the ostentarium, a written collection describing and interpreting signs (ostenta).Jerzy Linderski, \\"The libri reconditi\\", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 89 (1985), p. 231‚Äì232. Tarquinius Priscus wrote an Ostentarium arborarium, a book on signs pertaining to trees, and an Ostentarium Tuscum, presumably translations of Etruscan works.Both are mentioned by Macrobius, Saturnalia 3.20.3 and 3.7.2; Nancy Thomson de Grummond, \\"Introduction: The History of the Study of Etruscan Religion\\", in The Religion of the Etruscans (University of Texas Press, 2006), p. 2. Pliny cites his contemporary Umbricius Melior for an ostentarium aviarium, concerning birds.Pliny, Natural History 10.6‚Äì42. They were consulted until late antiquity; in the 4th century, for instance, the haruspices consulted the books of Tarquinius before the battle that proved fatal to the emperor Julian ‚Äî according to Ammianus Marcellinus, because he failed to heed them.Ex Tarquitianis libris in titulo \\"de rebus divinis\\": Ammianus Marcellinus XXV 27. Fragments of ostentaria survive as quotations in other literary works.Robert Schilling, \\"The Disciplina Etrusca\\", Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 44. ostentum According to Varro, an ostentum is a sign so called because it shows (ostendit) something to a person.Varro quoted by Servius, note to Aeneid 3.336, as cited by David Wardle, Cicero on Divination, Book 1 (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 330 online. Suetonius specified that \\"an ostentum shows itself to us without possessing a solid body and affects both our eyes and ears, like darkness or a light at night.\\"As cited by Wardle, Cicero on Divination, p.330. In his classic work on Roman divination, Auguste Bouch√©- Leclercq thus tried to distinguish theoretical usage of ostenta and portenta as applying to inanimate objects, monstra to biological signs, and prodigia for human acts or movements, but in non-technical writing the words tend to be used more loosely as synonyms.Wardle, Cicero on Divination, p. 330; Auguste Bouch√©-Leclerq, Histoire de la divination dans l'antiquit√© (J√©r√¥me Millon, 2003, originally published 1882), pp. 873‚Äì874 online. The theory of ostenta, portenta and monstra constituted one of the three branches of interpretation within the disciplina Etrusca, the other two being the more specific fulgura (thunder and lightning) and exta (entrails). Ostenta and portenta are not the signs that augurs are trained to solicit and interpret, but rather \\"new signs\\", the meaning of which had to be figured out through ratio (the application of analytical principles) and coniectura (more speculative reasoning, in contrast to augural observatio).Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), pp. 2150 and 2230‚Äì2232; see Cicero, De Divinatione, 1.72 and 2.49. ordo sacerdotum A religious hierarchy implied by the seating arrangements of priests (sacerdotes) at sacrificial banquets. As \\"the most powerful\\", the rex sacrorum was positioned next to the gods, followed by the Flamen Dialis, then the Flamen Martialis, then the Flamen Quirinalis and lastly, the Pontifex Maximus.Festus rationalises the order: the rex is \\"the most powerful\\" of priests, the Flamen Dialis is \\"sacerdos of the entire universe\\", the Flamen Martialis represents Mars as the parent of Rome's founder Romulus, and the Flamen Quirinalis represents the Roman principle of shared sovereignty. The Pontifex Maximus \\"is considered the judge and arbiter of things both divine and human\\": Festus, p. 198-200 L The ordo sacerdotum observed and preserved ritual distinctions between divine and human power. In the human world, the Pontifex Maximus was the most influential and powerful of all sacerdotes. P paludatus Mars wearing the paludamentum Paludatus (masculine singular, plural paludati) is an adjective meaning \\"wearing the paludamentum,\\"H.S. Versnel, Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion: Transition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual (Brill, 1993, 1994), p. 158, especially note 104. the distinctive attire of the Roman military commander. VarroDe lingua latina 7.37. and Festus say that any military ornament could be called a paludamentum, but other sources indicate that the cloak was primarily meant. According to Festus, paludati in the augural books meant \\"armed and adorned\\" (armati, ornati).Festus, p. 291 L, citing Veranius (1826 edition of Dacier, p. 1084 online); R. Del Ponte, \\"Documenti sacerdotali in Veranio e Granio Flacco,\\" Diritto e Storia 4 (2005). As the commander crossed from the sacred boundary of Rome (pomerium), he was paludatus, adorned with the attire he would wear to lead a battle and for official business.Jerzy Linderski, \\"Q. Scipio Imperator,\\" in Imperium sine fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic (Franz Steiner, 1996), p. 168; Jonathan Edmondson and Alison Keith, Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 12. This adornment was thus part of the commander's ritual investiture with imperium.Fred K. Drogula, \\"Imperium, potestas and the pomerium in the Roman Republic,\\" Historia 56.4 (2007), pp. 436‚Äì437. It followed upon the sacrifices and vows the commander offered up on the Capitol, and was concomitant with his possession of the auspices for war.Christoph F. Konrad, \\"Vellere signa,\\" in Augusto augurio: rerum humanarum et divinarum commentationes in honorem Jerzy Linderski (Franz Steiner, 2004), p. 181; see Cicero, Second Verrine 5.34; Livy 21.63.9 and 41.39.11. Festus notes elsewhere that the \\"Salian virgins\\", whose relation to the Salian priests is unclear, performed their rituals paludatae,Festus 439L, as cited by Versnel, Inconsistencies, p. 158 online. dressed in military garb.Thomas N. Habinek, The World of Roman Song: From Ritualized Speech to Social Order (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), p. 256. pax deorum Pax, though usually translated into English as \\"peace,\\" was a compact, bargain or agreement.The noun derives from the past participle of pacisci to agree, to come to an agreement, allied to pactus, past participle of verb pangere to fasten or tie. Compare Sanskrit pac to bind, and Greek peegnumi, I fasten: W. W. Skeat Etymological Dictionary of the English Language s.v. peace, pact In religious usage, the harmony or accord between the divine and human was the pax deorum or pax divom (\\"the peace of the gods\\" or \\"divine peace\\").As in Plautus, Mercator 678; Lucetius, De rerum natura V, 1227; Livy III 5, 14. Pax deorum was only given in return for correct religious practice. Religious error (vitium) and impiety led to divine disharmony and ira deorum (the anger of the gods). piaculum A piaculum is an expiatory sacrifice, or the victim used in the sacrifice; also, an act requiring expiation.J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion of the Romans (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 81 online. Because Roman religion was contractual (do ut des), a piaculum might be offered as a sort of advance payment; the Arval Brethren, for instance, offered a piaculum before entering their sacred grove with an iron implement, which was forbidden, as well as after.William Warde Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922), p. 191. The pig was a common victim for a piaculum.Robert E.A. Palmer, \\"The Deconstruction of Mommsen on Festus 462/464 L, or the Hazards of Interpretation\\", in Imperium sine fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic (Franz Steiner, 1996), p. 99, note 129 online; Roger D. Woodard, Indo-European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult (University of Illinois Press, 2006), p. 122 online. The Augustan historian Livy says P. Decius Mus is \\"like\\" a piaculum when he makes his vow to sacrifice himself in battle (see devotio).Livy 8.9.1‚Äì11. pius The origin of the English word \\"pious\\", pius is found in Volscian as pihom estu, Umbrian as pihaz (a past participle equivalent to Latin piatum) and Oscan as pehed, from the Proto-Indo-European root *q(u)ei-.Compare Sanskrit cayati. See M. Morani \\"Latino sacer...\\" in Aevum LV 1981 pp. 30-46. Pius may derive from Umbrian and thus appear with a p instead of a q; some Indo-European languages resolved the original velar k(h) into the voiceless labial p, as did Greek and Celtic. Umbrian is one of such languages although it preserved the velar before a u. In Proto-Italic it has given ii with a long first i as in pii-: cfr. G. L. Bakkum The Latin Dialect of the Ager Faliscus: 150 Years of Scholarship p. 57 n. 34 quoting Meiser 1986 pp.37-38. In Latin and other Italic languages, the word seems to have meant \\"that which is in accord with divine law.\\" Later it was used to designate actions respectful of divine law and even people who acted with respect towards gods and godly rules. The pius person \\"strictly conforms his life to the ius divinum.William Warde Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922), p. 462. \\"Dutiful\\" is often a better translation of the adjective than \\"pious.\\"Gerard Mussies, \\"Cascelia's Prayer,\\" in La Soteriologia dei culti orientali nell' impero romano (Brill, 1982), p. 160. Pius is a regular epithet of the Roman founding hero Aeneas in Vergil's Aeneid.Along with pater, \\"father.\\" Hendrik Wagenvoort, \\"Horace and Vergil,\\" in Studies in Roman Literature, Culture and Religion (Brill, 1956), pp. 82‚Äì83. See also pietas, the related abstract noun. pietas Pietas, from which English \\"piety\\" derives, was the devotion that bound a person to the gods, to the Roman state, and to his family.

Latte R√∂mische Religionsgeschichte, Munich 1960 p. 400-1; H. Fugier Recherches sur l'expression du sacr√© dans la langue latine Paris 1963 pp.161-172. Pontifex in this case would be the \\"opener of the way\\" corresponding to the Vedic adharvayu, the only active and moving sacerdos in the sacrificial group who takes his title from the figurative designation of liturgy as a way. Another hypothesisFirst proposed by F. Ribezzo in \\"Pontifices 'quinionalis sacrificii effectores', Rivista indo-greco-italica di Filologia-Lingua-Antichit√† 15 1931 p. 56. considers the word as a loan from the Sabine language, in which it would mean a member of a college of five people, from Osco-Umbrian ponte, five. This explanation takes into account that the college was established by Sabine king Numa Pompilius and the institution is Italic: the expressions pontis and pomperias found in the Iguvine Tablets may denote a group or division of five or by five. The pontifex would thus be a member of a sacrificial college known as pomperia (Latin quinio).For a review of the proposed hypotheses cfr. J. P. Hallet \\"Over Troubled Waters: The Meaning of the Title Pontifex\\" in Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 101 1970 p. 219 ff. Attendant at a sacrifice with ax popa The popa was one of the lesser- rank officiants at a sacrifice. In depictions of sacrificial processions, he carries a mallet or axe with which to strike the animal victim. Literary sources in late antiquity say that the popa was a public slave.Marietta Horster, \\"Living on Religion: Professionals and Personnel\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion, pp. 332‚Äì334. See also victimarius. porricere The verb porricere had the specialized religious meaning \\"to offer as a sacrifice,\\" especially to offer the sacrificial entrails (exta) to the gods.Macrobius, Saturnalia III 2, 3- 4: R. Del Ponte, \\"Documenti sacerdotali in Veranio e Granio Flacco\\" in Diritto estoria, 4, 2005. Both exta porricere and exta dare referred to the process by which the entrails were cooked, cut into pieces, and burnt on the altar. The Arval Brethren used the term exta reddere, \\"to return the entrails,\\" that is, to render unto the deity what has already been given as due.Robert Schilling, \\"Roman Sacrifice,\\" Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 79 online. portentum A portentum is a kind of sign interpreted by a haruspex, not an augur, and by means of coniectura rather than observatio. Portentum is a close but not always exact synonym of ostentum, prodigium, and monstrum.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), pp. 2232, 2247. Cicero uses portentum frequently in his treatise De divinatione, where it seems to be a generic word for prodigies.Claude Moussy, \\"Signa et portenta\\", in Donum grammaticum: Studies in Latin and Celtic Linguistics in Honour of Hannah Ros√©n (Peeters, 2002), p. 269 online. The word could also refer in non-technical usage to an unnatural occurrence without specific religious significance; for instance, Pliny calls an Egyptian with a pair of non-functional eyes on the back of his head a portentum.Pliny, Natural History 11.272, Latin text at LacusCurtius; Mary Beagon, Roman Nature: The Thought of Pliny the Elder (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 146. Varro derives portentum from the verb portendere because it portends something that is going to happen.Varro's passage is preserved by Servius, note to Aeneid 3.336, as cited by David Wardle, Cicero on Divination, Book 1 (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 330 online. In the schema of A. Bouch√©-Leclercq, portenta and ostenta are the two types of signs that appear in inanimate nature, as distinguished from the monstrum (a biological singularity), prodigia (the unique acts or movements of living beings), and a miraculum, a non-technical term that emphasizes the viewer's reaction.Auguste Bouch√©-Leclercq, Histoire de la divination dans l'antiquit√©: Divination hell√©nique et divination italique (J√©r√¥me Millon, 2003 reprint), pp. 873‚Äì874. The sense of portentum has also been distinguished from that of ostentum by relative duration of time, with the ostentum of briefer manifestation.Blandine Cuny-Le Callet, Rome et ses monstres: Naissance d'un concept philosophique et rh√©torique (J√©r√¥me Millon, 2005), p. 48, with reference to Fronto. Although the English word \\"portent\\" derives from portentum and may be used to translate it, other Latin terms such as ostentum and prodigium will also be found translated as \\"portent\\".For instance, Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), pp. 43 and 98. Despite its title, S.W. Rasmussen's Public Portents in Republican Rome (L'Erma, Bretschneider, 2003) does not distinguish among prodigium, omen, portentum and ostentum (p. 15, note 9). Portentum offers an example of an ancient Roman religious term modified for Christian usage; in the Christian theology of miracles, a portentum occurring by the will of the Christian God could not be regarded as contrary to nature (contra naturam), thus Augustine specified that if such a sign appeared to be unnatural, it was only because it was contrary to nature as known (nota) by human beings.Augustine, De civitate Dei 21.8: Portentum ergo fit non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura (\\"therefore a portent does not occur contrary to nature, but contrary to what is known of nature\\"). See Michael W. Herren and Shirley Ann Brown, Christ in Celtic Christianity (Boydell Press, 2002), p. 163. precatio The precatio was the formal addressing of the deity or deities in a ritual. The word is related by etymology to prex, \\"prayer\\" (plural preces), and usually translated as if synonymous. Pliny says that the slaughter of a sacrificial victim is ineffectual without precatio, the recitation of the prayer formula.Pliny, Natural History 28.11, as cited by Matthias Klinghardt, \\"Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion\\", Numen 46 (1999), p. 15. Priestly texts that were collections of prayers were sometimes called precationes.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), p. 2246. Two late examples of the precatio are the Precatio Terrae Matris (\\"The Prayer of Mother Earth\\") and the Precatio omnium herbarum (\\"Prayer of All the Herbs\\"), which are charms or carmina written metrically,A.A. Barb, \\"Animula Vagula Blandula ... Notes on Jingles, Nursery-Rhymes and Charms with an Excursus on Noththe's Sisters\\", Folklore 61 (1950), p. 23; Maarten J. Vermaseren and Carel C. van Essen, The Excavations in the Mithraeum of the Church of Santa Prisca on the Aventine (Brill, 1965), pp. 188‚Äì191. the latter attached to the medical writings attributed to Antonius Musa.W.S. Teuffel, History of Roman Literature (London, 1900, translation of the 5th German edition), vol. 1, p. 547. Dirae precationes were \\"dire\\" prayers, that is, imprecations or curses.Pliny, Natural History 28.19, as cited by Nicole Belayche, \\"Religious Actors in Daily Life\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 287. In augural procedure, precatio is not a prayer proper, but a form of invocation (invocatio) recited at the beginning of a ceremony or after accepting an oblative sign. The precatio maxima was recited for the augurium salutis, the ritual conducted by the augurs to obtain divine permission to pray for Rome's security (salus).Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", pp. 2252‚Äì2256. In legal and rhetorical usage, precatio was a plea or request.Steven M. Cerutti, Cicero's Accretive Style: Rhetorical Strategies in the Exordia of the Judicial Speeches (University Press of America, 1996), passim; Jill Harries, Law and Empire in Late Antiquity (Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 36. prex Prex, \\"prayer\\", usually appears in the plural, preces. Within the tripartite structure that was often characteristic of formal ancient prayer, preces would be the final expression of what is sought from the deity, following the invocation and a narrative middle.Fritz Graf, \\"Prayer in Magic and Religious Ritual\\", in Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion (Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 189. A legitimate request is an example of bonae preces, \\"good prayer.\\"Robert Schilling, \\"Roman Sacrifice\\", Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 77. Tacitae preces are silent or sotto voce prayers as might be used in private ritual or magic; preces with a negative intent are described with adjectives such as Thyesteae (\\"Thyestean\\"), funestae (\\"deadly\\"), infelices (aimed at causing unhappiness), nefariae,Georg Luck, Arcana Mundi (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006), p. 515. or dirae.Dirae is used by Tacitus (Annales 14.30) to describe the preces uttered by the druids against the Romans at Anglesey. In general usage, preces could refer to any request or entreaty. The verbal form is precor, precari, \\"pray, entreat.\\" The Umbrian cognate is persklu, \\"supplication.\\" The meaning may be \\"I try and obtain by uttering appropriate words what is my right to obtain.\\" It is used often in association with quaeso in expressions such as te precor quaesoque, \\"I pray and beseech you\\", or prece quaesit, \\"he seeks by means of prayer.\\"As in Lucretius, De rerum natura 5.1229. According to Emile Benveniste (Le vocabulaire, p. 404) quaeso would mean \\"I use the appropriate means to obtain\\"; in the interpretation of Morani, quaeso means \\"I wish to obtain, try and obtain\\", while precor designates the utterance of the adequate words to achieve one's aim. In Roman law of the Imperial era, preces referred to a petition addressed to the emperor by a private person.Adolf Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law (American Philosophical Society, 1991 reprint), p. 648; Detlef Liebs, \\"Roman Law\\", in The Cambridge Ancient History. Late Antiquity: Empire and Successors, A.D. 425-600 (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 15, p. 243. prodigium Prodigia (plural) were unnatural deviations from the predictable order of the cosmos. A prodigium signaled divine displeasure at a religious offense and must be expiated to avert more destructive expressions of divine wrath. Compare ostentum and portentum, signs denoting an extraordinary inanimate phenomenon, and monstrum and miraculum, an unnatural feature in humans. Prodigies were a type of auspicia oblativa; that is, they were \\"thrust upon\\" observers, not deliberately sought.Andrew Lintott, The Constitution of the Roman Republic (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999, reprinted 2002), p. 103 online. Suspected prodigies were reported as a civic duty. A system of official referrals filtered out those that seemed patently insignificant or false before the rest were reported to the senate, who held further inquiry; this procedure was the procuratio prodigiorum. Prodigies confirmed as genuine were referred to the pontiffs and augurs for ritual expiation.Orlin, in R√ºpke (ed), 60. For particularly serious or difficult cases, the decemviri sacris faciundis could seek guidance and suggestions from the Sibylline Books.R. Bloch ibidem p. 96 The number of confirmed prodigies rose in troubled times. In 207 BC, during one of the worst crises of the Punic Wars, the senate dealt with an unprecedented number, the expiation of which would have involved \\"at least twenty days\\" of dedicated rites.Rosenberger, in R√ºpke (ed), 297. Major prodigies that year included the spontaneous combustion of weapons, the apparent shrinking of the sun's disc, two moons in a daylit sky, a cosmic battle between sun and moon, a rain of red-hot stones, a bloody sweat on statues, and blood in fountains and on ears of corn. These were expiated by the sacrifice of \\"greater victims\\". The minor prodigies were less warlike but equally unnatural; sheep became goats; a hen become a cock, and vice versa. The minor prodigies were duly expiated with \\"lesser victims\\". The discovery of a hermaphroditic four-year-old child was expiated by its drowningRosenberger, in R√ºpke (ed), 295 - 8: the task fell to the haruspex, who set the child to drown in the sea. The survival of such a child for four years after its birth would have been regarded as extreme dereliction of religious duty. and a holy procession of 27 virgins to the temple of Juno Regina, singing a hymn to avert disaster; a lightning strike during the hymn rehearsals required further expiation.Livy, 27.37.5‚Äì15; the hymn was composed by the poet Livius Andronicus. Cited by Halm, in R√ºpke (ed) 244. For remainder, see Rosenberger, in R√ºpke (ed), 297. Religious restitution was proved only by Rome's victory.See Livy, 22.1 ff. The expiatory burial of living human victims in the Forum Boarium followed Rome's defeat at Cannae in the same wars. In Livy's account, Rome's victory follows its discharge of religious duties to the gods.For Livy's use of prodigies and portents as markers of Roman impiety and military failure, see Feeney, in R√ºpke (ed), 138 - 9. For prodigies in the context of political decision-making, see Rosenberger, in R√ºpke (ed), 295 - 8. See also R. Bloch Les prodiges dans l'antiquite'-Les prodiges a Rome It. transl. 1981, chap. 1, 2 Livy remarked the scarcity of prodigies in his own day as a loss of communication between gods and men. In the later Republic and thereafter, the reporting of public prodigies was increasingly displaced by a \\"new interest in signs and omens associated with the charismatic individual.\\"Dennis Feeney, in J√∂rg R√ºpke, (Editor), A Companion to Roman Religion, Wiley-Blackwell, 2007. p.140. profanum Literally, \\"in front of the shrine\\", therefore not within a sacred precinct; not belonging to the gods but to humankind. propitius; praepetes (aves) An adjective of augural terminology meaning favourable. From pro- before and petere seek, but originally fly. It implies a kind of favourable pattern in the flight of birds, i.e. flying before the person who is taking the auspices. Synonym secundus.Festus s. v. praepetes aves p. 286 L \\"aves quae se ante auspicantem ferunt\\" \\"who go before the a.\\", 224 L \\"quia secundum auspicium faciant praetervolantes...aut ea quae praepetamus indicent...\\" \\"since they make the auspice favourable by flying nearby...or point to what we wish for...\\". W. W. Skeat An Etymological Dictionary of the English language s. v. propitious New York 1963 (reprint). pulvinar The pulvinar (plural pulvinaria) was a special couch used for displaying images of the gods, that they might receive offerings at ceremonies such as the lectisternium or supplicatio.William Warde Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922), pp. 265‚Äì266; Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 40. In the famous lectisternium of 217 BC, on orders of the Sibylline books, six pulvinaria were arranged, each for a divine male-female pair.Charlotte Long, The Twelve Gods of Greece and Rome (Brill, 1987), pp. 235‚Äì236. By extension, pulvinar can also mean the shrine or platform housing several of these couches and their images. At the Circus Maximus, the couches and images of the gods were placed on an elevated pulvinar to \\"watch\\" the games. Q R regina sacrorum The wife of the rex sacrorum, who served as a high priestess with her own specific religious duties. religio The word religio originally meant an obligation to the gods, something expected by them from human beings or a matter of particular care or concern as related to the gods.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), p. 2180, and in the same volume, G.J. Szemler, \\"Priesthoods and Priestly Careers in Ancient Rome,\\" p. 2322. In this sense, religio might be translated better as \\"religious scruple\\" than with the English word \\"religion\\".Clifford Ando, The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire (University of California Press, 2008), p. 126. One definition of religio offered by Cicero is cultus deorum, \\"the proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods.\\"Cicero, De natura deorum 2.8. Religio among the Romans was not based on \\"faith\\", but on knowledge, including and especially correct practice.Ando, The Matter of the Gods, p. 13. Religio (plural religiones) was the pious practice of Rome's traditional cults, and was a cornerstone of the mos maiorum,Nicole Belayche, in R√ºpke, J√∂rg (Editor), A Companion to Roman Religion, Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p. 279: \\"Care for the gods, the very meaning of religio, had [therefore] to go through life, and one might thus understand why Cicero wrote that religion was \\"necessary\\". Religious behavior ‚Äì pietas in Latin, eusebeia in Greek ‚Äì belonged to action and not to contemplation. Consequently religious acts took place wherever the faithful were: in houses, boroughs, associations, cities, military camps, cemeteries, in the country, on boats.\\" the traditional social norms that regulated public, private, and military life. To the Romans, their success was self-evidently due to their practice of proper, respectful religio, which gave the gods what was owed them and which was rewarded with social harmony, peace and prosperity. Dedication from Roman Britain announcing that a local official has restored a locus religiosusCIL VII.45 = ILS 4920. Religious law maintained the proprieties of divine honours, sacrifice and ritual. Impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were vitia (faults, hence \\"vice,\\" the English derivative); excessive devotion, fearful grovelling to deities, and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were superstitio; neglecting the religiones owed to the traditional gods was atheism, a charge leveled during the Empire at Jews,Jack N. Lightstone, \\"Roman Diaspora Judaism,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 360, 368. Christians, and Epicureans.Adelaide D. Simpson, \\"Epicureans, Christians, Atheists in the Second Century,\\" Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 72 (1941) 372‚Äì381. Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger (ira deorum) and therefore harm the State.Beard et al., Vol. 1, 217. See Religion in ancient Rome. religiosus Religiosus was something pertaining to the gods or marked out by them as theirs, as distinct from sacer, which was something or someone given to them by humans. Hence, a graveyard was not primarily defined as sacer but a locus religiosus, because those who lay within its boundaries were considered belonging to the di Manes.F. De Visscher \\"Locus religiosus\\" Atti del Congresso internazionale di Diritto Romano, 3, 1951 Places struck by lightning were tabooWarde Fowler considers a possible origin for sacer in taboos applied to holy or accursed things or places, without direct reference to deities and their property. W. Warde Fowler \\"The Original Meaning of the Word Sacer\\" Journal of Roman Studies, I, 1911, p.57-63 because they had been marked as religiosus by Jupiter himself.Varro. LL V, 150. See also Festus, 253 L: \\"A place was once considered to become religiosus which looked to have been dedicated to himself by a god\\": \\"locus statim fieri putabatur religiosus, quod eum deus dicasse videbatur\\". See also sacer and sanctus. res divinae Res divinae were \\"divine affairs,\\" that is, the matters that pertained to the gods and the sphere of the divine in contrast to res humanae, \\"human affairs.\\"Cicero, De natura deorum 2.3.82 and 2.28.72; Ittai Gradel, Emperor Worship and Roman Religion (Oxford University Press, 2002), pp. 4-6. Rem divinam facere, \\"to do a divine thing,\\" simply meant to do something that pertained to the divine sphere, such as perform a ceremony or rite. The equivalent Etruscan term is ais(u)na.Massimo Pallottino, \\"Sacrificial Cults and Rites in Pre-Roman Italty,\\" in Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p.33. The distinction between human and divine res was explored in the multivolume Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum, one of the chief works of Varro (1st century BC). It survives only in fragments but was a major source of traditional Roman theology for the Church Fathers. Varro devoted 25 books of the Antiquitates to res humanae and 16 to res divinae. His proportional emphasis is deliberate, as he treats cult and ritual as human constructs.Clifford Ando, \\"Religion and ius publicum,\\" in Religion and Law in Classical and Christian Rome (Franz Steiner, 2006), pp. 140‚Äì142. Varro divides res divinae into three kinds: * the mythic theology of the poets, or narrative elaboration; * the natural theology of the philosophers, or theorizing on divinity among the intellectual elite; * the civil theology concerned with the relation of the state to the divine. The schema is Stoic in origin, though Varro has adapted it for his own purposes.Gian Biagio Conte, Latin Literature: A History (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994, originally published 1987 in Italian), p. 213. Res divinae is an example of ancient Roman religious terminology that was appropriated for Christian usage; for St. Augustine, res divina is a \\"divine reality\\" as represented by a sacrum signum (\\"sacred sign\\") such as a sacrament.Herbert Vorgrimler, Sacramental Theology (Patmos, 1987, 1992), p. 45. responsum Responsa (plural) were the \\"responses,\\" that is, the opinions and arguments, of the official priests on questions of religious practice and interpretation. These were preserved in written form and archived.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The libri reconditi\\", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 89 (1985), pp.218‚Äì219. Compare decretum. rex sacrorum The rex sacrorum was a senatorial priesthoodJ√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion of the Romans (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 223 online. reserved for patricians. Although in the historical era the Pontifex Maximus was the head of Roman state religion, Festus saysFestus on the ordo sacerdotum, 198 in the edition of Lindsay. that in the ranking of priests, the rex sacrorum was of highest prestige, followed by the flamines maiores.Gary Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War (University of California Press, 2005), p. 136 online. ritus Although ritus is the origin of the English word \\"rite\\" via ecclesiastical Latin, in classical usage ritus meant the traditional and correct manner (of performance), that is, \\"way, custom\\". Festus defines it as a specific form of mos: \\"Ritus is the proven way (mos) in the performance of sacrifices.\\" The adverb rite means \\"in good form, correctly.\\"Festus, entry on ritus, p. 364 (edition of Lindsay): ritus est est mos comprobatus in administrandis sacrificis. See also the entry on ritus from Paulus, Festi Epitome, p. 337 (Lindsay), where he defines ritus as mos or consuetudo, \\"customary use\\", adding that rite autem significat bene ac recte. See also Varro De Lingua Latina II 88; Cicero De Legibus II 20 and 21. This original meaning of ritus may be compared to the concept of ·πõt√° (\\"visible order\\", in contrast to dhƒÅman, dhƒÅrman) in Vedic religion, a conceptual pairing analogous to Latin fas and ius.G. Dum√©zil ARR It. tr. Milan 1977 p. 127 citing A. Bergaigne La religion v√©dique III 1883 p. 220. For Latin words meaning \\"ritual\\" or \\"rite\\", see sacra, caerimoniae, and religiones.Jean-Louis Durand, John Scheid Rites et religion. Remarques sur certains pr√©jug√©s des historiens de la religions des Grecs et des Romains\\" in Archives des sciences sociales des religions 85 1994 pp. 23-43 part. pp. 24-25. ritus graecus A small number of Roman religious practices and cult innovations were carried out according to \\"Greek rite\\" (ritus graecus), which the Romans characterized as Greek in origin or manner. A priest who conducted ritu graeco wore a Greek-style fringed tunic, with his head bare (capite aperto) or laurel-wreathed. By contrast, in most rites of Roman public religion, an officiant wore the distinctively Roman toga, specially folded to cover his head (see capite velato). Otherwise, \\"Greek rite\\" seems to have been a somewhat indefinite category, used for prayers uttered in Greek, and Greek methods of sacrifice within otherwise conventionally Roman cult. Roman writers record elements of ritus graecus in the cult to Hercules at Rome's Ara Maxima, which according to tradition was established by the Greek king Evander even before the city of Rome was founded at the site. It thus represented one of the most ancient Roman cults. \\"Greek\\" elements were also found in the Saturnalia held in honor of the Golden Age deity Saturn, and in certain ceremonies of the Ludi saeculares. A Greek rite to Ceres (ritus graecus cereris) was imported from Magna Graecia and added to her existing Aventine cult in accordance with the Sibylline books, ancient oracles written in Greek. Official rites to Apollo are perhaps \\"the best illustration of the Graecus ritus in Rome.\\" The Romans regarded ritus graecus as part of their own mos maiorum (ancestral tradition), and not as novus aut externus ritus, novel or foreign rite. The thorough integration and reception of rite labeled \\"Greek\\" attests to the complex, multi-ethnic origins of Rome's people and religious life.John Scheid, \\"Graeco Ritu: A Typically Roman Way of Honoring the Gods\\", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Vol. 97, Greece in Rome: Influence, Integration, 1995, pp. 15‚Äì31. S sacellum Sacellum, a diminutive from sacer (\\"belonging to a god\\"),Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights 7.12.5, discounting the etymology proffered by Gaius Trebatius in his lost work On Religions (as sacer and cella). is a shrine. Varro and Verrius Flaccus give explanations that seem contradictory, the former defining a sacellum in its entirety as equivalent to a cella,Varro, Res Divinae frg. 62 in the edition of Cardauns. which is specifically an enclosed space, and the latter insisting that a sacellum had no roof.Verrius Flaccus as cited by Festus, p. 422.15‚Äì17 L. \\"The sacellum,\\" notes J√∂rg R√ºpke, \\"was both less complex and less elaborately defined than a temple proper.\\"J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion of the Romans (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), pp. 183‚Äì185. Each curia had its own sacellum.Dionysius Halicarnassus II 64, 3. sacer Sacer describes a thing or person given to the gods, thus \\"sacred\\" to them. Human beings had no legal or moral claims on anything sacer. Sacer could be highly nuanced; Varro associates it with \\"perfection\\".Varro, De res rustica, 2.1., describes porci sacres (pigs considered sacer and thus reserved for sacrifice) as necessarily \\"pure\\" (or perfect); \\"porci puri ad sacrificium\\". Through association with ritual purity, sacer could also mean \\"sacred, untouchable, inviolable\\". Anything not sacer was profanum: literally, \\"in front of (or outside) the shrine\\", therefore not belonging to it or the gods. A thing or person could be made sacer (consecrated), or could revert from sacer to profanum (deconsecrated), only through lawful rites (resecratio) performed by a pontiff on behalf of the state.M. Morani \\"Lat. sacer...cit. p. 41. See also Festus. p. 414 L2 & p.253 L: Gallus Aelius ait sacrum esse quodcumque modo atque instituto civitatis consecratum est, sive aedis sive ara sive signum, locum sive pecunia, sive aliud quod dis dedicatum atque consecratum sit; quod autem privati suae religionis causa aliquid earum rerum deo dedicent, id pontifices Romanos non existimare sacrum: \\"Gallus Aelius says that sacer is anything made sacred (consecratum) in any way or by any institution of the community, be it a building or an altar or a sign, a place or money, or anything that else can be dedicated to the gods; the Roman pontiffs do not consider sacer any things dedicated to a god in private religious cult.\\" Part of the ver sacrum sacrificial vow of 217 BC stipulated that animals dedicated as sacer would revert to the condition of profanum if they died through natural cause or were stolen before the due sacrificial date. Similar conditions attached to sacrifices in archaic Rome....si id moritur...profanum esto \\"if the animal dies...it shall be profane\\": Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 22.10. For the archaic variant, see G. Dumezil La religion romaine archaique Paris, 1974, Considerations preliminaires A thing already owned by the gods or actively marked out by them as divine property was distinguished as religiosus, and hence could not be given to them or made sacer.F. De Visscher \\"Locus religiosus\\" Atti del Congresoo internazionale di Diritto Romano, 3, 1951Warde Fowler considers a possible origin for sacer in the taboos applied to things or places holy or accursed without direct reference to deities and their property. W. Warde Fowler \\"The Original Meaning of the Word Sacer\\" Journal of Roman Studies, I, 1911, p.57-63 Persons judged sacer under Roman law were placed beyond further civil judgment, sentence and protection; their lives, families and properties were forfeit to the gods. A person could be declared sacer who harmed a plebeian tribune, failed to bear legal witness,As in Horace, Sermones II 3, 181, failed to meet his obligations to clients, or illicitly moved the boundary markers of fields.As in Servius, Aeneid VI, 609: Dionysius of Halicarnassus, II 10, 3; Festus 505 L. It was not a religious duty (fas) to execute a homo sacer, but he could be killed with impunity.Festus, p422 L: \\"homo sacer is est quem populus iudicavit ob maleficium; neque fas est eum imolari, sed qui occidit, parricidii non damnatur\\". For further discussion on the homo sacer in relation to the plebeian tribunes, see Ogilvie, R M, A Commentary on Livy 1-5, Oxford, 1965.H. Bennet Sacer esto.. thinks that the person declared sacred was originally sacrificed to the gods. This hypothesis seems to be supported by Plut. Rom. 22, 3 and Macr. Sat.III, 7, 5, who compare the homo sacer to the victim in a sacrifice. The prerogative of declaring somebody sacer supposedly belonged to the king during the regal era; during the Republic, this right passed to the pontiff and courts. Dies sacri (\\"sacred days\\") were nefasti, meaning that the ordinary human affairs permitted on dies profani (or fasti) were forbidden. Sacer was a fundamental principle in Roman and Italic religions. In Oscan, related forms are sakoro, \\"sacred,\\" and sakrim, \\"sacrificial victim\\". Oscan sakaraklum is cognate with Latin sacellum, a small shrine, as Oscan sakarater is with Latin sacratur, consecrare, \\"consecrated\\". The sacerdos is \\"one who performs a sacred action\\" or \\"renders a thing sacred\\", that is, a priest.G. Devoto Origini Indoeuropee (Firenze, 1962), p. 468 Marcus Aurelius capite velato carries out a sacrifice. By his left side is a flamen wearing an apex. The victima is the bull, who will be struck by the popa to the right. The music of the aulos was to drive off inauspicious noise. The setting is the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter. sacerdos A sacerdos (plural sacerdotes, a word of either masculine or feminine gender) was any priest or priestess, from *sakro-dho-ts, \\"the one who does the sacred act.\\"John Scheid, An Introduction to Roman Religion (Indiana University Press, 2003), p. 129. There was no priestly caste in ancient Rome, and in some sense every citizen was a priest in that he presided over the domestic cult of his household. Senators, magistrates, and the decurions of towns performed ritual acts, though they were not sacerdotes per se.Scheid, Introduction to Roman Religion, pp. 129‚Äì130. The sacerdos was one who held the title usually in relation to a specific deity or temple.Lesley E. Lundeen, \\"In Search of the Etruscan Priestess: A Re-Examination of the hatrencu,\\" in Religion in Republican Italy (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 46; Celia E. Schultz, Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), pp. 70‚Äì71. See also collegium and flamen. sacra Sacra (neuter plural of sacer) are the traditional cults, either publica or privata, both of which were overseen by the College of Pontiffs. The sacra publica were those performed on behalf of the whole Roman people or its major subdivisions, the tribes and curiae. They included the sacra pro populo, \\"rites on behalf of the Roman people,\\" i.e., all the feriae publicae of the Roman calendar year and the other feasts that were regarded of public interest, including those pertaining to the hills of Rome,Varro. De Lingua Latina VI 24; Festus sv Septimontium p. 348, 340, 341L; Plut. Quest. Rom. 69 to the pagi and curiae, and to the sacella, \\"shrines\\".Festus sv Publica sacra; Dionys. Hal. II 21, 23; Appian. Hist. Rom. VIII 138; de Bello Civ. II 106; Plut. Quaest. Rom. 89; Christopher John Smith, The Roman Clan: The gens from Ancient Ideology to Modern Anthropology (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 44. The establishment of the sacra publica is ascribed to king Numa Pompilius, but many are thought to be of earlier origin, even predating the founding of Rome. Thus Numa may be seen as carrying out a reform and a reorganisation of the sacra in accord with his own views and his education.Plutarch Numa 14, 6-7 gives a list of Numa's ritual prescriptions: obligation of sacrificing an uneven number of victims to the heavenly gods and an even one to the inferi (cf. Serv. Ecl. 5, 66; Serv. Dan. Ecl. 8, 75; Macrobius I 13,5); the prohibition to make libations to the gods with wine; of sacrificing without flour; the obligation to pray and worship divinities while making a turn on oneselves (Livy V 21,16; Suetonius Vit. 2); the composition of the indigitamenta (Arnobius Adversus nationes II 73, 17-18). Sacra publica were performed at the expense of the state, according to the dispositions left by Numa, and were attended by all the senators and magistrates.Livy I, 20; Dion. Hal. II Sacra privata were particular to a gens, to a family, or to an individual, and were carried out at the expense of those concerned. Individuals had sacra on dates peculiar to them, such as birthdays, the dies lustricus, and at other times of their life such as funerals and expiations, for instance of fulgurations.Macrobius I 12. Macrobius mentions in former times the inadvertent nomination of Salus, Semonia, Seia, Segetia, Tutilina required the observance of a dies feriatus of the person involved. Families had their own sacra in the home or at the tombs of their ancestors, such as those pertaining to the Lares, Manes and Penates of the family, and the Parentalia. These were regarded as necessary and imperishable, and the desire to perpetuate the family's sacra was among the reasons for adoption in adulthood.Cic. de Leg. II 1, 9-21; Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 44. In some cases, the state assumed the expenses even of sacra privata, if they were regarded as important to the maintenance of the Roman religious system as a whole; see sacra gentilicia following. sacra gentilicia Sacra gentilicia were the private rites (see sacra above) that were particular to a gens (\\"clan\\"). These rites are related to a belief in the shared ancestry of the members of a gens, since the Romans placed a high value on both family identity and commemorating the dead.William Warde Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922), p. 86. During the Gallic siege of Rome, a member of the gens Fabia risked his life to carry out the sacra of his clan on the Quirinal Hill; the Gauls were so impressed by his courageous piety that they allowed him to pass through their lines.Livy 5.46.2‚Äì3; Clifford Ando, The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire (University of California Press, 2009), pp. 142‚Äì143; Emmanuele Curti, \\"From Concordia to the Quirinal: Notes on Religion and Politics in Mid- Republican/Hellenistic Rome,\\" in Religion in Archaic and Republican Rome and Italy: Evidence and Experience (Routledge, 2000), p. 85; Robert E.A. Palmer, \\"The Deconstruction of Mommsen on Festus 462/464, or the Hazards of Interpretation\\", in Imperium sine fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic (Franz Steiner, 1996), The Fabian sacra were performed in Gabine dress by a member of the gens who was possibly named a flamen.Liv. V 46; XXII 18; Dionys. Hal. Ant. Rom. IX 19; Cic. Har. Resp. XV 32; Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 43ff.; Smith, The Roman Clan, p. 46. There were sacra of Minerva in the care of the Nautii, and rites of Apollo that the Iulii oversaw.Mommsen thought, perhaps wrongly, that the Julian sacra for Apollo was in fact a sacrum publicum entrusted to a particular gens. Mommsen Staatsrecht III 19; G. Dum√©zil La religion romaine archaique It. tr. Milano 1977 p. 475 The Claudii had recourse to a distinctive \\"propudial pig\\" sacrifice (propudialis porcus, \\"pig of shame\\") by way of expiation when they neglected any of their religious obligations.Festus, p. 274 (edition of Lindsay); Robert Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome (Routledge, 2001; originally published in French 1998), p. 44; Smith, The Roman Clan, p. 45. Roman practices of adoption, including so-called \\"testamentary adoption\\" when an adult heir was declared in a will, were aimed at perpetuating the sacra gentilicia as well as preserving the family name and property.Legal questions might arise about the extent to which the inheritance of property was or ought to be attached to the sacra; Andrew R. Dyck, A Commentary on Cicero, De Legibus (University of Michigan Press, 2004), pp. 381‚Äì382, note on an issue raised at De legibus 2.48a. A person adopted into another family usually renounced the sacra of his birth (see detestatio sacrorum) in order to devote himself to those of his new family.Cicero, De legibus 2.1.9-21; Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 44. Sacra gentilicia sometimes acquired public importance, and if the gens were in danger of dying out, the state might take over their maintenance. One of the myths attached to Hercules' time in Italy explained why his cult at the Ara Maxima was in the care of the patrician gens Potitia and the gens Pinaria; the diminution of these families by 312 BC caused the sacra to be transferred to the keeping of public slaves and supported with public funding.J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion of the Romans (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 26. sacra municipalia The sacra of an Italian town or community (municipium) might be perpetuated under the supervision of the Roman pontiffs when the locality was brought under Roman rule. Festus defined municipalia sacra as \\"those owned originally, before the granting of Roman citizenship; the pontiffs desired that the people continue to observe them and to practice them in the way (mos) they had been accustomed to from ancient times.\\"Festus 146 in the edition of Lindsay. These sacra were regarded as preserving the core religious identity of a particular people.Olivier de Cazanove, \\"Pre-Roman Italy, Before and Under the Romans,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 55. sacramentum Sacramentum is an oath or vow that rendered the swearer sacer, \\"given to the gods,\\" in the negative sense if he violated it.J√∂rg R√ºpke, Domi Militiae: Die religi√∂se Konstruktion des Krieges in Rom (Franz Steiner, 1990), pp. 76‚Äì80. Sacramentum also referred to a thing that was pledged as a sacred bond, and consequently forfeit if the oath were violated.D. Briquel \\"Sur les aspects militaires du dieu ombrien Fisus Sancius\\" in Revue de l' histoire des religions i p. 150-151; J. A. C. Thomas A Textbook of Roman law Amsterdam 1976 p. 74 and 105. Both instances imply an underlying sacratio, act of consecration. In Roman law, a thing given as a pledge or bond was a sacramentum. The sacramentum legis actio was a sum of money deposited in a legal procedureVarro De Lingua latina V 180; Festus s.v. sacramentum p. 466 L; 511 L; Paulus Festi Epitome p.467 L. to affirm that both parties to the litigation were acting in good faith.George Mousourakis, A Legal History of Rome (Routledge, 2007), p. 33. If correct law and procedures had been followed, it could be assumed that the outcome was iustum, right or valid. The losing side had thus in effect committed perjury, and forfeited his sacramentum as a form of piaculum; the winner got his deposit back. The forfeited sacramentum was normally allotted by the state to the funding of sacra publica.Mousourakis, A Legal History of Rome, pp. 33, 206. The sacramentum militare (also as militum or militiae) was the oath taken by soldiers in pledging their loyalty to the consul or emperor. The sacramentum that renders the soldier sacer helps explain why he was subjected to harsher penalties, such as execution and corporal punishment, that were considered inappropriate for civilian citizens, at least under the Republic.See further discussion at fustuarium In effect, he had put his life on deposit, a condition also of the fearsome sacramentum sworn by gladiators.Gladiators swore to commit their bodies to the possibility of being \\"burned, bound, beaten, and slain by the sword\\"; Petronius, Satyricon 117; Seneca, Epistulae 71.32. In the later empire, the oath of loyalty created conflict for Christians serving in the military, and produced a number of soldier-martyrs.Carlin A. Barton, The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster (Princeton University Press, 1993), pp. 14‚Äì16, 35 (note 88), 42, 45‚Äì47. Sacramentum is the origin of the English word \\"sacrament\\", a transition in meaning pointed to by Apuleius's use of the word to refer to religious initiation.Apuleius, Metamorphoses 11.15.5; Robert Schilling, \\"The Decline and Survival of Roman Religion,\\" in Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981) The sacramentum as pertaining to both the military and the law indicates the religious basis for these institutions. The term differs from iusiurandum, which is more common in legal application, as for instance swearing an oath in court. A sacramentum establishes a direct relation between the person swearing (or the thing pledged in the swearing of the oath) and the gods; the iusiurandum is an oath of good faith within the human community that is in accordance with ius as witnessed by the gods.Arnaldo Momigliano, Quinto contributo alla storia degli studi classici e del mondo antico (Storia e letteratura, 1975), vol. 2, pp. 975‚Äì977; Luca Grillo, The Art of Caesar's Bellum Civile: Literature, Ideology, and Community (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 60. sacrarium A sacrarium was a place where sacred objects (sacra) were stored or deposited for safekeeping.Ulpian, Digest I.8.9.2: sacrarium est locus in quo sacra reponuntur. The word can overlap in meaning with sacellum, a small enclosed shrine; the sacella of the Argei are also called sacraria.Ittai Gradel, Emperor Worship and Roman Religion (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 10. In Greek writers, the word is ·º±ŒµœÅŒøœÜœÖŒªŒ¨Œ∫ŒπŒøŒΩ hierophylakion (hiero-, \\"sacred\\" and phylakion, something that safeguards).Robert E. A. Palmer, The Archaic Community of the Romans, p. 171, note 1. See sacellum for a list of sacraria. The sacrarium of a private home lent itself to Christian transformation, as a 4th-century poem by Ausonius demonstrates;R.P.H. Green, \\"The Christianity of Ausonius,\\" Studia Patristica: Papers Presented at the Eleventh International Conference on Patristic Studies Held in Oxford 1991 (Peeters, 1993), vol. 28, pp. 39 and 46; Kim Bowes, \\"'Christianization' and the Rural Home,\\" Journal of Early Christian Studies 15.2 (2007), pp. 143‚Äì144, 162. in contemporary Christian usage, the sacrarium is a \\"special sink used for the reverent disposal of sacred substances\\" (see piscina).Built of Living Stones: Art, Architecture, and Worship: Guidelines (United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2005), p. 73. See also Wolfred Nelson Cote, The Archaeology of Baptism (Lond, 1876), p. 138. sacrificium An event or thing dedicated to the gods for their disposal. The offer of sacrifice is fundamental to religio. See also Sacer and Religion in ancient Rome: Sacrifice. sacrosanctus An adjective first introduced to define the inviolability of the function (potestas) of the tribunes of the plebs and of other magistrates sanctioned by law leges Valeriae Horatiae in 449 BC, mentioned by Livy III 55, 1. It seems the sacrality of the function the tribune had already been established in earlier times through a religio and a sacramentum,Livy II 33, 1; III 19, 10 however it obliged only the contracting parties. In order to become a rule that obliged everybody it had to be sanctioned through a sanctio that was not only civil but religious as well: the trespasser was to be declared sacer, his family and property sold.Dionysius of Halicarnassus VI 89, 3 Sacer would thus design the religious compact, sanctus the law. According to other passages in Livy, the law was not approved by some jurists of the time who maintained that only those who infringed the commonly recognised divine laws (id (or Iovi corr. Mueller) sacrum sanciti) could fall into the category of those to be declared sacri. In fact in other places Livy states that only the potestas and not the person of the tribune was defined as sacrosancta.Livy IV 3, 6; 44, 5;XXIX 20, 11 The word is used in Livy III 19, 10 by the critics of the law in this way: \\"These people postulate they themselves should be sacrosancti, they who do not hold even gods for sacred and saint?\\"M. Morani Latino sacer... Aevum LV 1981 p. 40 The meaning of the word is given as guaranteed by an oath by H. Fugier, however Morani thinks it would be more appropriate to understand the first part of the compound as a consequence of the second: sanxit tribunum sacrum the tribune is sanctioned by the law as sacer. This kind of word composition based on an etymological figure has parallels in other IE languages in archaic constructions. Salii The Salii were the \\"leaping\\". sancio A verb meaning to ratify a compact and put it under the protection of a sanctio, penalty, sanction. The formation and original meaning of the verb are debated. Some scholars think it is derived by the IE stem root *sak (the same of sacer) through a more recent way of word formation, i.e. by the insertion of a nasal n infix and the suffix -yo, such as Lithuanian iung-iu from IE stem *yug. Thence sancio would mean to render something sacer, i.e. belonging to the gods in the sense of having their guarantee and protection.H. Fugier Recherches sur l'expression du sacre' dans la langue latine Paris 1963; E. Benveniste Le vocubulaire des institutions indoeuropeenees Paris 1939, p. 427 ff. Some think it is a derivation from the theonym Sancus, the god of the ratification of foedera and protection of good faith, from the root sancu- plus suffix -io as inquio>incio.P.Krestchmer in Glotta 1919, X, p. 155 In such case the verb would mean an act that reflects or conforms to the function of this god, i.e. the ratifying and guaranteeing compacts. sanctus Sanctus, an adjective formed on the past participle of verb sancio, describes that which is \\"established as inviolable\\" or \\"sacred\\", most times in a sense different from that of sacer and religiosus. In fact its original meaning would be that which is protected by a sanction (sanctio). It is connected to the name of the Umbrian or Sabine founder-deity Sancus (in Umbrian Sancius) whose most noted function was the ratifying and protecting of compacts (foedera).H. Fugier, Recherches, pp. 125 ff; E. Benveniste, Le vocabulaire, pp. 427 ff.; K. Latte Roemische Religionsgeshichte Muenchen 1960 p.127 ff.; D. Briquel \\"Sur les aspects militaires du dieu Ombrien Fisius Sancius\\" Paris 1978 The Roman jurist Ulpian distinguishes sanctus as \\"neither sacred (sacer) nor profane (profanum) ... nor religiosus.\\"Ulpian Digest 1.8.9: dicimus sancta, quae neque sacra neque profana sunt. Gaius writes that a building dedicated to a god is sacrum, a town's wall and gate are res sanctae because they belong \\"in some way\\" to divine law, and a graveyard is religiosus because it is relinquished to the di Manes. Thus some scholars think that it should originally be a concept related to space i.e. concerning inaugurated places, because they enjoyed the armed protection (sanctio) of the gods.G. DumezilLa religion Romaine archaique It. transl. Milano 1977 p. 127; F. Sini \\"Sanctitas: cose, uomini, dei\\" in Sanctitas. Persone e cose da Roma a Costantinopoli a Mosca Roma 2001; Cic. de Nat. Deor. III 94; Festus sv tesca p. 488LGaius, following Aelius Gallus: inter sacrum autem et sanctum et religiosum differentias bellissime refert [Gallus]: sacrum aedificium, consecrato deo; sanctum murum, qui sit circa oppidum. See also Marcian, Digest 1.8.8: \\"sanctum\\" est quod ab iniuria hominum defensum atque munitum est (\\"it is sanctum that which is defended and protected from the attack of men\\"). Various deities, objects, places and people - especially senators and magistrates - can be sanctus. Claudia Quinta is described as a sanctissima femina (most virtuous woman) and Cato the Younger as a sanctus civis (a morally upright citizen).Huguette Fugier, Recherches sur l'expression du sacr√© dans la langue latine, Archives des sciences sociales des religions, 1964, Volume 17, Issue 17, p.180 Servius glosses Amsancti valles (Aeneid 7.565) as loci amsancti, id est omni parte sancti (\\"amsancti valleys: amsancti places, that is, sanctus here in the sense of secluded, protected by a fence, on every side\\"). The Oxford Latin Dictionary, however, identifies Ampsanctus in this instance and in Cicero, De divinatione 1.79 as a proper noun referring to a valley and lake in Samnium regarded as an entrance to the Underworld because of its mephitic air. See also sanctuary. Later the epithet sanctus is given to many gods including Apollo Pythius by Naevius, Venus and Tiberinus by Ennius and Livy: Ennius renders the Homeric dia theaoon as sancta dearum; in the early Imperial era, Ovid describes Terminus, the god who sanctifies land boundaries, as sanctusOvid, Fasti 2.658. and equates sancta with augusta (august).Ovid Fasti 1.608-9. The original spatial connotation of the word is still reflected in its use as an epithet of the river Tiber and of god Terminus that was certainly ancient: borders are sancti by definition and rivers used to mark borders. Sanctus as referred to people thus over time came to share some of the sense of Latin castus (morally pure or guiltless), pius (pious), and none of the ambiguous usages attached to sacer and religiosus. In ecclesiastical Latin, sanctus is the word for saint, but even in the Christian era it continues to appear in epitaphs for people who had not converted to Christianity.Nancy Edwards, \\"Celtic Saints and Early Medieval Archaeology\\", in Local Saints and Local Churches in the Early Medieval West (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 229 online. servare de caelo Literally, \\"to watch (for something) from the sky\\"; that is, to observe the templum of the sky for signs that might be interpreted as auspices. Bad omens resulted in a report of obnuntiatio.Robert A. Castus, CIcero: Speech on Behalf of Publius Sestius (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 416; Susanne William Rasmussen, Public Portents in Republican Rome (Rome, 2003), p. 163 online. signum A signum is a \\"sign, token or indication\\".C.T. Lewis & C. Short, A Latin Dictionary, Oxford. Clarendon Press, 1879. Online at In religious use, signum provides a collective term for events or things (including signs and symbols) that designate divine identity, activity or communication, including prodigia, auspicia, omina, portenta and ostenta. silentium Silence was generally required in the performance of every religious ritual.Pliny Naturalis Historia XXVIII 11; Seneca De Vita Beata XXVI 7; Cicero De Divinatione I 102; Servius Danielis In Aeneidem V 71. The ritual injunction favete linguis, \\"be favourable with your tongues,\\" meant \\"keep silent.\\" In particular, silence assured the ritual correctness and the absence of vitia, \\"faults,\\" in the taking of the auspices.Cicero De Divinatione II 71 and 72; Festus v. Silentio surgere p. 474 L; v. Sinistrum; Livy VII 6, 3-4; T. I. VI a 5-7. It was also required in the nomination (dictio) of the dictator.Livy VIII 23, 15; IX 38, 14; IV 57, 5. sinister In ancient times, augurs (augures ex caelo) faced south, so the happy orient, where the sun rose, lay at their left. Consequently, the word sinister (Latin for left) meant well-fated. When, under Greek influence, it became customary for augurs to face north, sinister came to indicate the ill-fated west, where light turned into darkness. It is this latter and later meaning that is attached to the English word sinister. sodalitas A sodalitas was a form of voluntary association or society. Its meaning is not necessarily distinct from collegium in ancient sources, and is found also in sodalicium, \\"fraternity.\\"J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion of the Romans (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 206. The sodalis is a member of a sodalitas, which describes the relationship among sodales rather than an institution. Examples of priestly sodalitates are the Luperci, fetiales, Arval brothers and Titii; these are also called collegia, but that they were a kind of confraternity is suggested by the distinctive convivial song associated with some.Thomas N. Habinek, The World of Roman Song: From Ritualized Speech to Social Order pp. 36‚Äì37. An association of sodales might also form a burial society, or make religious dedications as a group; inscriptions record donations made by women for the benefit of sodales.For instance, a woman and her associates (socii) donated a lot with a \\"clubhouse\\" (schola) and colonnade to Silvanus and his sodalicium, who were to use it for sacrifice, banquets, and dinners; Robert E.A. Palmer, \\"Silvanus, Sylvester, and the Chair of St. Peter\\", Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 122 (1978), pp. 237, 243. Roman Pythagoreans such as Nigidius Figulus formed sodalicia,Attilio Mastrocinque, \\"Creating One's Own Religion: Intellectual Choices\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 382. with which Ammianus Marcellinus compared the fellowship (sodalicia consortia) of the druids in Gallo-Roman culture.Ammianus Marcellinus, 15.9.8; Georges Dottin, Manuel pour servir √† l'√©tude de l'Antiquit√© Celtique (Paris, 1906), pp. 279‚Äì289: the sodalicia consortia of the druids \\"ne signifie pas autre chose qu'associations corporatives, coll√®ges, plus ou moins analogues aux coll√®ges sacerdotaux des Romains\\" (sodalicia consortia can \\"mean nothing other than corporate associations, colleges, more or less analogous to the priestly colleges of the Romans\\"). When the cult of Cybele was imported to Rome, the eunuchism of her priests the galli discouraged Roman men from forming an official priesthood; instead, they joined sodalitates to hold banquets and other forms of traditional Roman cultus in her honor.Eric Orlin, \\"Urban Religion in the Middle and Late Republic\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion, pp. 63‚Äì64; John Scheid, \\"Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors\\", p. 268. The sodalitates are thought to originate as aristocratic brotherhoods with cultic duties, and their existence is attested as early as the late 6th or early 5th century BC. The Twelve Tables regulated their potential influence by forbidding them to come in conflict with public law (ius publicum).Gaius, Digest xlvii.22.4 = Twelve Tables viii.27; A. Drummond, \\"Rome in the Fifth Century\\", Cambridge Ancient History: The Rise of Rome to 220 B.C. (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 2002 reprint), vol. 7, part 2, p. 158 online. During the 60s BC, certain forms of associations were disbanded by law as politically disruptive, and in Ciceronian usage sodalitates may refer either to these subversive organizations or in a religious context to the priestly fraternities.J.-M. David, S. Demougin, E. Deniaux, D. Ferey, J.-M. Flambard, C. Nicolet, \\"Le Commentariolum petitionis de Quintus Cic√©ron\\", Aufstieg under Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt I (1973) pp. 252, 276‚Äì277. See also Sodales Augustales. For the Catholic concept, see sodality. spectio Spectio (\\"watching, sighting, observation\\") was the seeking of omens through observing the sky, the flight of birds, or the feeding of birds. Originally only patrician magistrates and augurs were entitled to practice spectio, which carried with it the power to regulate assemblies and other aspects of public life, depending on whether the omens were good or bad.W. Jeffrey Tatum, The Patrician Tribune (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), p.127. See also obnuntiatio. sponsio Duenos inscription Sponsio is a formal, religiously guaranteed obligation. It can mean both betrothal as pledged by a woman's family, and a magistrate's solemn promise in international treaties on behalf of the Roman people.W. H. Buckler The origin and history of contract in Roman law 1895 pp. 13-15 The Latin word derives from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning a libation of wine offered to the gods, as does the Greek verb spendoo and the noun spondai, spondas, and Hittite spant-.The Hittite is also written as sipant or ispant-. In Greek it also acquired the meaning \\"compact, convention, treaty\\" (compare Latin foedus), as these were sanctioned with a libation to the gods on an altar. In Latin, sponsio becomes a legal contract between two parties, or sometimes a foedus between two nations. In legal Latin the sponsio implied the existence of a person who acted as a sponsor, a guarantor for the obligation undertaken by somebody else. The verb is spondeo, sponsus. Related words are sponsalia, the ceremony of betrothal; sponsa, fianc√©e; and sponsus, both the second-declension noun meaning a husband-to-be and the fourth declension abstract meaning suretyship.Servius, note to Aeneid X 79 The ceremonial character of sponsio suggestsIn conjunction with archaeological evidence from Lavinium. that Latin archaic forms of marriage were, like the confarreatio of Roman patricians, religiously sanctioned. Dum√©zil proposed that the oldest extant Latin document, the Duenos inscription, could be interpreted in light of sponsio.G. Dumezil \\"La deuxieme ligne de l'inscription de Duenos\\" in Latomus 102 1969 pp. 244-255; Idees romaines Paris 1969 pp. 12 ff. superstitio Superstitio was excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance, in the sense of \\"doing or believing more than was necessary\\",J√∂rg R√ºpke, \\"Roman Religion ‚Äî Religions of Rome,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 5. or \\"irregular\\" religious practice that conflicted with Roman custom. \\"Religiosity\\" in its pejorative sense may be a better translation than \\"superstition\\", the English word derived from the Latin.Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, pp. 215‚Äì217. Cicero defined superstitio as the \\"empty fear of the gods\\" (timor inanis deorum) in contrast to the properly pious cultivation of the gods that constituted lawful religio,Maijastina Kahlos, Debate and Dialogue: Christian and Pagan Cultures c. 360-430 (Ashgate, 2007), p. 95. a view that Seneca expressed as \\"religio honours the gods, superstitio wrongs them.\\"Seneca, De clementia 2.5.1; Beard et al, Religions of Rome: A History, p. 216. Seneca wrote an entire treatise on superstitio, known to St. Augustine but no longer extant.Beard et al, Religions of Rome: A History, p. 216. Lucretius's famous condemnation of what is often translated as \\"Superstition\\" in his Epicurean didactic epic De rerum natura is actually directed at Religio.Yasmin Haskell, \\"Religion and Enlightenment in the Neo- Latin Reception of Lucretius,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Lucretius (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 198 online. Before the Christian era, superstitio was seen as a vice of individuals. Practices characterized as \\"magic\\" could be a form of superstitio as an excessive and dangerous quest for personal knowledge.Beard et al, Religions of Rome: A History, pp. 217‚Äì219. By the early 2nd century AD, religions of other peoples that were perceived as resistant to religious assimilation began to be labeled by some Latin authors as superstitio, including druidism, Judaism, and Christianity.Beard et al, Religions of Rome: A History, p. 221. Under Christian hegemony, religio and superstitio were redefined as a dichotomy between Christianity, viewed as true religio, and the superstitiones or false religions of those who declined to convert.Lactantius, Divine Institutes 4.28.11; Beard et al, Religions of Rome: A History, p. 216. supplicatio Supplicationes are days of public prayer when the men, women, and children of Rome traveled in procession to religious sites around the city praying for divine aid in times of crisis. A suplicatio can also be a thanksgiving after the receipt of aid.Frances Hickson Hahn, \\"Performing the Sacred: Prayers and Hymns,\\" pp. 238, 247, and John Scheid, \\"Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors,\\" p. 270, both in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007). Supplications might also be ordered in response to prodigies; again, the population as a whole wore wreaths, carried laurel twigs, and attended sacrifices at temple precincts throughout the city.Veit Rosenberger, in \\"Religious Actors in Daily Life: Practices and Related Beliefs,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion, p. 296. T tabernaculum See auguraculum. The origin of the English word \\"tabernacle.\\" templum A templum was the sacred space defined by an augur for ritual purposes, most importantly the taking of the auspices, a place \\"cut off\\" as sacred: compare Greek temenos, from temnein to cut.W. W. Skeat Etymological Dictionary of the English Language New York 1963 sv temple It could be created as temporary or permanent, depending on the lawful purpose of the inauguration. Auspices and senate meetings were unlawful unless held in a templum; if the senate house (Curia) was unavailable, an augur could apply the appropriate religious formulae to provide a lawful alternative.Mary Beard, Simon Price, John North, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 23. To create a templum, the augur aligned his zone of observation (auguraculum, a square, portable surround) with the cardinal points of heaven and earth. The altar and entrance were sited on the east-west axis: the sacrificer faced east. The precinct was thus \\"defined and freed\\" (effatum et liberatum).Beard et al., \\"Religions of Rome,\\" vol. 1, p. 23. In most cases, signs to the augur's left (north) showed divine approval and signs to his right (south), disapproval.Servius Ad Aeneid 4.200; Festus. s.v. calls the auguraculum minora templa. Temple buildings of stone followed this ground- plan and were sacred in perpetuity.G. Dumezil La religion romaine archaique Paris, 1974 p.510: J. Marquardt \\"Le cult chez les romaines\\" Manuel des antiquit√©s romaines XII 1. French Transl. 1889 pp. 187-188: See also Cicero, De Legibus, 2.2, & Servius,Aeneid, 4.200. Rome itself was a kind of templum, with the pomerium as sacred boundary and the arx (citadel), and Quirinal and Palatine hills as reference points whenever a specially dedicated templum was created within. Augurs had authority to establish multiple templa beyond the pomerium, using the same augural principles. V verba certa Verba certa (also found nearly as often with the word order certa verba) are the \\"exact words\\" of a legal or religious formula, that is, the words as \\"set once and for ever, immutable and unchangeable.\\" Compare certae precationes, fixed prayers of invocation, and verba concepta, which in both Roman civil law and augural law described a verbal formula that could be \\"conceived\\" flexibly to suit the circumstances.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), pp. 2266‚Äì2267 online, and 2292‚Äì2293. On legal usage, see also Elizabeth A. Meyer, Legitimacy and Law in the Roman World (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 80ff.; Daniel J. Gargola, Land, Laws and Gods: Magistrates and Ceremony in the Regulation of Public Lands in Republican Rome (University of North Carolina Press, 1995), p. 202, note 55 online. With their emphasis on exact adherence, the archaic verba certaMeyer, Legitimacy and Law, p. 62 online. are a magico-religious form of prayer.Hendrik Wagenvoort, \\"Augustus and Vesta\\", in Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion (Brill, 1980), p. 211 online. In a ritual context, prayer (prex) was not a form of personal spontaneous expression, but a demonstration that the speaker knew the correct thing to say. Words were regarded as having power; in order to be efficacious, the formula had to be recited accurately, in full, and with the correct pronunciation. To reduce the risk of error (vitium), the magistrate or priest who spoke was prompted from the text by an assistant.Matthias Klinghardt, \\"Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion\\", Numen 46 (1999) 1‚Äì52. verba concepta In both religious and legal usage, verba concepta (\\"preconceived words\\") were verbal formulas that could be adapted for particular circumstances. Compare verba certa, \\"fixed words.\\" Collections of verba concepta would have been part of the augural archives. Varro preserves an example, albeit textually vexed, of a formula for founding a templum.Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.16 (1986), pp. 2246, 2267ff. In the legal sense, concepta verba (the phrase is found with either word order) were the statements crafted by a presiding praetor for the particulars of a case.The jurist Gaius (4.30) says that concepta verba is synonymous with formulae, as cited by Adolf Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law (American Philosophical Society, 1991 reprint), p. 401, and Shane Butler, The Hand of Cicero (Routledge, 2002), p. 10. Earlier in the Roman legal system, the plaintiff had to state his claim within a narrowly defined set of fixed phrases (certa verba); in the Mid Republic, more flexible formulas allowed a more accurate description of the particulars of the issue under consideration. But the practice may have originated as a kind of \\"dodge,\\" since a praetor was liable to religious penalties if he used certa verba for legal actions on days marked nefastus on the calendar.T. Corey Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 131‚Äì132. St. Augustine removed the phrase verba concepta from its religious and legal context to describe the cognitive process of memory: \\"When a true narrative of the past is related, the memory produces not the actual events which have passed away but words conceived (verba concepta) from images of them, which they fixed in the mind like imprints as they passed through the senses.\\"Augustine, Confessions 11.xviii, as cited by Paolo Bartoloni, On the Cultures of Exile, Translation, and Writing (Purdue University Press, 2008), p. 69 online. Augustine's conceptualizing of memory as verbal has been used to elucidate the Western tradition of poetry and its shared origins with sacred song and magical incantation (see also carmen), and is less a departure from Roman usage than a recognition of the original relation between formula and memory in a pre- literate world.For instance, Karla Taylor, Chaucer Reads \\"The Divine Comedy\\" (Stanford University Press, 1989), p. 27 online. For an overview of the Indo- European background regarding the relation of memory to poetry, charm, and formulaic utterance, see Calvert Watkins, How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics (Oxford University Press, 1995), passim, especially pp. 68‚Äì70 on memory and the poet-priest (Latin vates) as \\"the preserver and the professional of the spoken word\\". \\"For the Romans\\", notes Frances Hickson Hahn, \\"there was no distinction between prayer and spell and poetry and song; all were intimately linked to one another\\"; see \\"Performing the Sacred: Prayers and Hymns\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 236 Some scholars see the tradition of stylized, formulaic language as the verbal tradition from which Latin literature develops, with concepta verba appearing in poems such as Carmen 34 of Catullus.Gian Biagio Conte, Latin Literature: A History (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994, originally published 1987 in Italian), pp. 15‚Äì23; George A. Sheets, \\"Elements of Style in Catullus,\\" in A Companion to Catullus (Blackwell, 2011) n.p. ver sacrum The \\"sacred spring\\" was a ritual migration. victima Victims for the suovetaurilia led to the altar by victimarii, one of whom carries an implement for striking The victima was the animal offering in a sacrifice, or very rarely a human. The victim was subject to an examination (probatio victimae) by a lower-rank priest (pontifex minor) to determine whether it met the criteria for a particular offering.Katja Moede, \\"Reliefs, Public and Private\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 173. With some exceptions, male deities received castrated animals. Goddesses were usually offered female victims, though from around the 160s AD the goddess Cybele was given a bull, along with its blood and testicles, in the Taurobolium. Color was also a criterion: white for the upper deities, dark for chthonic, red for Vulcan and at the Robigalia. A sacred fiction of sacrifice was that the victim had to consent, usually by a nod of the head perhaps induced by the victimarius holding the halter. Fear, panic, and agitation in the animal were bad omens.John Scheid, \\"Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 264, 266.For the Taurobolium, see Duthoy, Robert, The Taurobolium: Its Evolution and Terminology, Volume 10, Brill, 1969, p. 1 ff, and Cameron, Alan, The Last Pagans of Rome, Oxford University press, 2011, p. 163. The earliest known Taurobolium was dedicated to the goddess Venus Caelestis in 134 AD. The word victima is used interchangeably with hostia by Ovid and others, but some ancient authors attempt to distinguish between the two.Steven J. Green, Ovid, Fasti 1: A Commentary (Brill, 2004), pp.159‚Äì160. Servius saysServius, note to Aeneid 1. 334. that the hostia is sacrificed before battle, the victima afterward, which accords with Ovid's etymology of \\"victim\\" as that which has been killed by the right hand of the \\"victor\\" (with hostia related to hostis, \\"enemy\\").Victima quae dextra cecidit victrice vocatur, Ovid, Fasti 1.335: ; hostibus a domitis hostia nomen habet (\\"the hostia gets its name from the 'hostiles' that have been defeated\\"), 1.336. The difference between the victima and hostia is elsewhere said to be a matter of size, with the victima larger (maior).Char. 403.38. See also piaculum and votum. victimarius The victimarius was an attendant or assistant at a sacrifice who handled the animal.Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 368. Using a rope, he led the pig, sheep, or bovine that was to serve as the victim to the altar. In depictions of sacrifice, a victimarius called the popa carries a mallet or axe with which to strike the victima. Multiple victimarii are sometimes in attendance; one may hold down the victim's head while the other lands the blow.Katja Moede, \\"Reliefs, Public and Private\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 168. The victimarius severed the animal's carotid with a ritual knife (culter), and according to depictions was offered a hand towel afterwards by another attendant. He is sometimes shown dressed in an apron (limus). Inscriptions show that most victimarii were freedmen, but literary sources in late antiquity say that the popa was a public slave.Marietta Horster, \\"Living on Religion: Professionals and Personnel\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion (ed. R√ºpke), pp. 332‚Äì334. vitium A mistake made while performing a ritual, or a disruption of augural procedure, including disregarding the auspices, was a vitium (\\"defect, imperfection, impediment\\"). Vitia, plural, could taint the outcome of elections, the validity of laws, and the conducting of military operations. The augurs issued an opinion on a given vitium, but these were not necessarily binding. In 215 BC the newly elected plebeian consul M. Claudius Marcellus resigned when the augurs and the senate decided that a thunderclap expressed divine disapproval of his election.Therefore the election must have been vitiated in some way known only to Jupiter: see Veit Rosenberger, in R√ºpke, J√∂rg (Editor), A Companion to Roman Religion, Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p.298; citing Cicero, De Divinatione, 2.77. The original meaning of the semantic root in vitium may have been \\"hindrance\\", related to the verb vito, vitare, \\"to go out of the way\\"; the adjective form vitiosus can mean \\"hindering\\", that is, \\"vitiating, faulty.\\"David Wardle, Cicero on Divination, Book 1 (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 178. vitulari A verb meaning chanting or reciting a formula with a joyful intonation and rhythm.Macrobius, Saturnalia III 2,12. The related noun Vitulatio was an annual thanksgiving offering carried out by the pontiffs on 8 July, the day after the Nonae Caprotinae. These were commemorations of Roman victory in the wake of the Gallic invasion. Macrobius says vitulari is the equivalent of Greek paianizein (œÄŒ±ŒπŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ∂ŒµŒπŒΩ), \\"to sing a paean\\", a song expressing triumph or thanksgiving.William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London, 1908), p. 179'; Robert Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome (Routledge, 2001), p. 75. votum In a religious context, votum, plural vota, is a vow or promise made to a deity. The word comes from the past participle of voveo, vovere; as the result of the verbal action \\"vow, promise\\", it may refer also to the fulfillment of this vow, that is, the thing promised. The votum is thus an aspect of the contractual nature of Roman religion, a bargaining expressed by do ut des, \\"I give that you might give.\\"John Scheid, \\"Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 270; William Warde Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922), pp. 200‚Äì202.

Other times they are prepared as a regular rice dish without the banana leaves because the dish has been too common and restaurants do not follow the traditions. Preparation of side dishes The opor ayam is usually served as pieces without their bones. This is usually done because they can wrap it in banana leaves easier without taking too much space. There are two types of opor ayam: white gravy, commonly used in West Java, and yellow gravy, commonly used in Central Java. Both are sweet but yellow opor ayam tends to have curry spices in it.Nasi Bogana Nasi Kentjana Online The dendeng is sometimes put in a stick and eaten the same way as a satay (meat in skewer). The telur pindang boiled eggs are most of the time cut in half and only half is served. This depends on the occasion. Serundeng, fried chicken liver and gizzard in chili and coconut gravy (suggested to use cow livers rather than chicken to avoid the smell), sambal of shredded red chili and saut√©ed tempeh and saut√©ed string beans is served regularly, a spoon-full of each circling the steamed rice. Tradition and culture In Java, nasi bogana is often used in special occasions, such as weddings and anniversaries, but is most commonly found in family gatherings and social gatherings (arisan). At weddings, nasi bogana usually has its own booth where people can choose their own side dishes and sauces. Most people prefer nasi bogana to be eaten with kerupuk (Indonesian flour crackers) or emping (crushed bean crackers from melinjo), and as a result it becomes a part of the side dish. Some people like additional sauce like Kecap manis (sweet soybean sauce) and sambal terasi (fish and shrimp chili sauce). The drink that they have while having this dish is most of the time hot or iced black tea. Nutrition Nasi bogana contains amounts of protein and carbohydrates from the meat and rice, but also contains a lot of fat and oil since it uses coconut and palm oils in the side dishes. Almost all of the side dishes are prepared by frying. The dish ranges from 1000-1600 calories per serving. It is comparable with fast food.

The massacre took place in seven villages of Yunnan Province, especially at the Shadian Town of Gejiu City, in July and August of 1975, causing the deaths of more than 1,600 civilians (866 from Shadian alone), including 300 children, and destroying 4,400 homes. The major conflict between Communist Party of China (CPC) and the local religious Hui people began in 1974, when the latter went to Kunming, the Capital of Yunnan, to demand the freedom of religion granted by Chinese Constitution. However, local government deemed the behavior of the hundreds of protesters as \\"making a disturbance\\" and \\"opposing the leadership of the Party\\". In 1975, the villagers attempted to forcefully re- open the mosques closed during the Cultural Revolution, escalating the conflict and brought the attention of Beijing. Eventually, in the 29th of July, 10,000 soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were ordered by Deng Xiaoping (some sources claimed it was Wang Hongwen) to settle the conflict, resulting in a massacre that lasted for about a week.

The incident  Conflicts  Shadian was not being allowed to reopen its mosque as a result of the aforementioned earlier incident in January. In 1974 a notice was issued ordering closure of mosques in the town. More than 1,000 people boarded a train to Beijing to complain. The conflict escalated when Communist leftists criticized the conservative Muslims, and when those Muslims took control of local PLA barracks and arsenals in several counties, they made weapons by themselves, arming themselves against perceived outside oppression.  Massacre  This ultimately let the central government to conclude that the movement had become militarily rebellious. A string of incidents ensued, culminating in a military attack by a 10,000 strong force of PLA soldiers (upon the approval of Mao Zedong) against the Hui people living in seven villages in July 1975. One week later, more than 1000 Huis lay dead with 4,400 houses destroyed. The PLA used guns, cannons and also aerial bombardment in the campaign.

The Communist Party under Deng Xiaoping blamed the worst and most violent parts of the Cultural Revolution which were directed at minorities upon the Gang of Four, especially Jiang Qing. After the Gang of Four were toppled by Hua Guofeng, the Communist Party ended the Cultural Revolution and issued apologies and reparations to survivors. The Gang of Four variously received death sentences or long prison terms, commuted to life imprisonment. The local people received certain amount of reparations from the government for the damages suffered, and after Deng Xiaoping's Gaige kaifang policy, the Malaysian and Middle East markets have been granted more access and special treatment by the government specifically for Shadian merchants, which has increased prosperity, and also increased religious and educational exchange, as more and more Hui students left for Islamic education abroad, and brought back Arabic speaking skills, religious ideas and practices from these countries. As part of the reparations scheme, the government has also erected a Martyr's Memorial in Shadian to honor the 800 officially recognised victims, whose graves surround the pathway that leads up to the memorial. The government also partially financed the building of the Great Mosque in Shadian which was completed in 2009. It is designed in an Arab style, and now serves as the town centre and a source of pride for the local Muslim community.

His first name was sometimes spelled John and last name Reeves by English speakers. Some sources give other middle names. Life Jean Baptiste Rives was born in the city of Bordeaux (part of the region of Gascony) circa 1793. He arrived in the Hawaiian Islands sometime between 1803 and 1810, probably as a cabin boy or steward, given his youth. He must have had an ear for learning new languages, since he spoke at least French and English, and picked up the Hawaiian language quickly. About the same age as the sons of King Kamehameha I, he became a close friend of the boys and became useful as an interpreter for the growing number of foreign visitors. The Royal teacher John Papa  ªƒ™ ªƒ´ had him give the princes language lessons. His short stature earned him the Hawaiian language nickname Luahine (\\"Old Woman\\"). Rise to favor When Prince Liholiho became King as Kamehameha II in May 1819, Rives became part of his \\"inner circle\\"; he was his personal secretary and a binge drinking companion. Rives was granted land on four different islands. Baptism on Uranie in 1819 On August 8, 1819 the French explorer Louis de Freycinet (1779‚Äì1842) arrived on the ship Uranie, and Rives acted as interpreter. (French) On August 12, the ship chaplain Abb√© de Qu√©len performed a Roman Catholic baptism ceremony on the chief minister Kalanimoku, and on August 27 island Governor Boki. Rives tried to convince others to join the ceremony, but people who would often plunge into the Pacific found it hard to believe a spoonful of water had much power. Jacques Arago describes Rives as a curious sight: he was under four feet tall, at a time when native Hawaiians were much taller than even average height Europeans. Rives was wearing an elegant silk robe that had to be tied up because it was far too large. Although Rives boasted of having sailed to china several times, being the son of a famous physician and curing the natives with his medicines, the fellow Gascons of the crew were embarrassed by his claims. In his journal, Arago says: > \\"...his fibs, if he told them with better grace and adroitness, would be the > only indication by which you could guess what countryman he was.\\" When the first Protestant missionaries arrived in March 1820, Rives advised the king to send them away. However, the Queen Regent Kaahumanu and other chiefs were convinced by the British advisor John Young and some Hawaiians on the ship to let them stay. The religious tension between different denominations of Christians would be a long-lasting conflict. The king appointed Rives as appointed captain of the royal yacht Cleopatra's Barge, after its purchase in January 1821, but probably served in only an honorary capacity since he was not known for his maritime skills. About 1822, Rives opened one of the first hotels in Honolulu, and ran a grog shop in the hotel. Rives had several children while in Hawaii with Holau, his Hawaiian wife of noble birth. Their twin daughters were Theresa Owana Kaheiheimalie Rives (1815‚Äì1850) and Virginia Kahoa Kaahumanu Rives (1815-after 1869?), followed by a son John Lafayette Rives (1822-after 1869?). Queen Kaahumanu adopted these girls and raised them as princesses. Gideon Peleioholani Laanui married Theresa. Virginia first married an American, Henry Augustus Peirce, and had a son Henry E. Pierce (born 1833) with him. Since there were no official records kept in this era, the legitimacy claim became a notable court case when H.A. Peirce returned almost 40 years later. Virginia divorced Peirce in 1837 and moved to Siberia. There she married a Russian. Back to Europe In the royal box at London, 1824 Rives was one of the party chosen by Kamehameha II to take the ship L'Aigle (French for \\"The Eagle\\") under Captain Valentine Starbuck on a state visit to London in November 1823. The English missionary William Ellis wanted to return to England and act as interpreter, and offered to pay for his own passage, but Rives convinced Starbuck to select him instead. While waiting for the royal audience, the king, queen, and other members of the court contracted measles and all died. Rives wrote a letter to Kalanimoku giving official notice of the death of the king, which was printed in the English newspapers. He accompanied the royal bodies to St Martin-in- the-Fields church where they awaited transportation back to Hawaii. It would be one of his last official acts. The royal entourage had left with $25,000 in their treasure chest, but only $10,000 remained by the time they arrived in London. Rives was suspected of taking or spending the funds, perhaps with Captain Starbuck as accomplice, who quickly departed. With so many of the royal court dead, Rives likely realized his services were no longer wanted. Another theory was he wanted to visit relatives; for whatever reason, he did not accompany the surviving members of the court on on their way back to Hawaii on September 8, 1824. John Young's son, James KƒÅnehoa, took over official duties as interpreter. Rives tried to convince investors in London to partner with him in a business venture, but found no takers. He went to Paris, where he claimed still to represent the Kingdom of Hawaii. He raised financing in early 1826 from the banker Jacques Laffitte and other investors, including the Javal family, to form a joint stock company to profit from trade with Hawaii. He also signed a treaty with the French government too guarantee his firm favorable trading rights. They did not trust Rives with overall management of the expedition, so hired Captain Auguste Bernard Duhaut-Cilly (1790‚Äì1849) as commander. They sailed from Le Havre on Le H√©ros on April 10, 1826 to Alta California. The French were more interested in exploiting the vast western coast of North American than isolated Pacific islands. Later years and death Le H√©ros arrived March 29, 1827 at Santa Barbara, California under the Spanish commander Jos√© de la Guerra y Noriega. They proceeded to Monterey, and were surprised to see another ship flying a French flag. While in Paris, Rives had asked for Catholic missionaries to be sent to Hawaii, and promised to fund the Church after they arrived. Eventually word reached Pope Leo XII, who appointed Alexis Bachelot of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary to lead the group; they left France November 21, 1826 on La Com√®te under command of Captain Plassard. when they arrived in Hawaii in July 1827, the missionaries learned they were not wanted in Hawaii. Plassard was told to take the passengers away but, his contract fulfilled, he departed without them. Duhaut-Cilly and Rives encountered La Com√®te in Monterey, and, hearing the story of the Hawaiian rejection, the senior Frenchman had more doubts about Rives. They returned to Santa Barbara, where on September 13, 1827 they met the schooner Waverly under Captain William Sumner; it had sailed from Hawaii. They chartered the Waverly for Rives to engage in trade along the Pacific Northwest coast and planned a rendez-vous with Duhaut-Cilly next summer. In October, Duhaut-Cilly left for Peru on Le H√©ros. He returned to Monterey from his trading expedition in July 1828. While waiting for Rives, he grew impatient, and started loading horses on board to sell in Hawaii. When the Waverley finally returned in late September to Monterey to meet Duhaut- Cilly, Rives was not on board. From Captain Sumner and Rives' letters, he discovered Rives had gone south to Mexico and lost all his cargo \\"in consequence of his imprudent conduct and his incapacity.\\" When Duhaut-Cilly finally arrived in the Hawaiian island, he learned that the general opinion of Rives was negative. In his absence, his lands were given to others. Rives died August 18, 1833 in Mexico, never seeing his family nor Hawaii again.

It is a generalization of constructible topology in classical algebraic geometry. In √©tale cohomology constructible sheaves are defined in a similar way . A sheaf of abelian groups on a Noetherian scheme is called constructible if the scheme has a finite cover by subschemes on which the sheaf is locally constant constructible (meaning represented by an √©tale cover). For the derived category of constructible sheaves, see a section in ‚Ñì-adic sheaf. The finiteness theorem in √©tale cohomology states that the higher direct images of a constructible sheaf are constructible. Definition of √©tale constructible sheaves on a scheme X Here we use the definition of constructible √©tale sheaves from the book by Freitag and Kiehl referenced below. In what follows in this subsection, all sheaves \\\\mathcal{F} on schemes X are √©tale sheaves unless otherwise noted. A sheaf \\\\mathcal{F} is called constructible if X can be written as a finite union of locally closed subschemes i_Y:Y \\\\to X such that each for each subscheme Y, the sheaf \\\\mathcal{F}|_{Y} = i_{Y}^{\\\\ast}\\\\mathcal{F} is a finite locally constant sheaf. In particular, this means for each subscheme Y appearing in the finite covering, there is an √©tale covering \\\\lbrace U_i \\\\to Y \\\\; \\\\; i \\\\in I \\\\rbrace such that for all √©tale subschemes in the cover of Y, the sheaf (i_Y)^{\\\\ast}\\\\mathcal{F}|_{U_i} is constant and represented by a finite set. This definition allows us to derive, from Noetherian induction and the fact that an √©tale sheaf is constant if and only if its restriction from X to X_{\\\\rm red} is constant as well, where X_{\\\\rm red} is the reduction of the scheme X. It then follows that a representable √©tale sheaf \\\\mathcal{F} is itself constructible. Of particular interest to the theory of constructible √©tale sheaves is the case in which one works with constructible √©tale sheaves of Abelian groups. The remarkable result is that constructible √©tale sheaves of Abelian groups are precisely the Noetherian objects in the category of all torsion √©tale sheaves (cf. Proposition I.4.8 of Freitag-Kiehl). Examples in algebraic topology  Most examples of constructible sheaves come from intersection cohomology sheaves or from the derived pushforward of a local system on a family of topological spaces parameterized by a base space. Derived Pushforward on \\\\mathbb{P}^1 One nice set of examples of constructible sheaves come from the derived pushforward (with or without compact support) of a local system on U = \\\\mathbb{P}^1-\\\\\\\\{0,1,\\\\infty\\\\\\\\}. Since any loop around \\\\infty is homotopic to a loop around 0,1 we only have to describe the monodromy around 0 and 1. For example, we can set the monodromy operators to be : \\\\begin{align} T_0 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & k \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} & T_1 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & l \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\end{align} where the stalks of our local system \\\\mathcal{L} are isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{Q}^{\\\\oplus 2}. Then, if we take the derived pushforward \\\\mathbf{R}j_* or \\\\mathbf{R}j_! of \\\\mathcal{L} for j: U \\\\to \\\\mathbb{P}^1 we get a constructible sheaf where the stalks at the points 0,1,\\\\infty compute the cohomology of the local systems restricted to a neighborhood of them in U. Weierstrass Family of Elliptic Curves For example, consider the family of degenerating elliptic curves : y^2 - x(x-1)(x-t) over \\\\mathbb{C}. At t=0,1 this family of curves degenerates into a nodal curve. If we denote this family by \\\\pi:X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} then : \\\\mathbf{R}^0\\\\pi_*(\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_X) \\\\cong \\\\mathbf{R}^2\\\\pi_*(\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_X) \\\\cong \\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\\\mathbb{C}} and : \\\\mathbf{R}^1\\\\pi_*(\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_X) \\\\cong \\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\mathbb{C}-\\\\\\\\{0,1 \\\\\\\\}}\\\\oplus \\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\\\\\\\{0,1 \\\\\\\\}} where the stalks of the local system \\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\mathbb{C}-\\\\\\\\{0,1 \\\\\\\\}} are isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{Q}^2. This local monodromy around of this local system around 0,1 can be computed using the Picard‚ÄìLefschetz formula References Seminar Notes * References  * Category:Algebraic geometry Category:Sheaf theory ","title":"Constructible sheaf"},{"id":"26131149","text":"The 40th Helicopter Squadron is a missile support unit. As the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron it was a helicopter rescue squadron of the USAF during the Vietnam War. History The squadron was activated as the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base in March 1968 with HH-3s which were nicknamed \\"Nitnoy.\\" Later HH-53s arrived and these were nicknamed \\"BUFF.\\" In March 1968, Detachment 2 of the 37th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron at Udorn RTAFB operating HH-3s and HH-53Bs, was transferred to the 40th ARRS. The 40th moved to Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base on 21 July 1971. 20 August 1972, the local base rescue detachments of the 3d Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Group each operating 2 HH-43s were transferred to the 40th ARRS, comprising: *Detachment 2 Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base *Detachment 3 Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base *Detachment 4 Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base *Detachment 5 Udorn RTAFB *Detachment 12 U-Tapao Royal Thai Naval Airfield *Detachment 14 Tan Son Nhut Air Base 30 November 1972, with the inactivation of the 37th ARRS at Danang Air Base, 5 of its HH-53s were transferred to the 40th ARRS, while its two HH-43s remained at Danang as Detachment 7 of the 40th ARRS to provide base rescue during Operation Linebacker II. Following the Paris Peace Accords all remaining US Forces were withdrawn from South Vietnam by 27 March 1973. Detachment 7 at Danang Air Base and Detachment 14 at Tan Son Nhut Air Base were inactivated during this period. Following the withdrawal from South Vietnam the 40th's force level was 11 HH-53s and 14 HH-43s. The USAF continued combat operations over Cambodia until 15 August 1973 and the 40th provided CSAR support during this period. Following the end of combat operations the 40th kept 2 HH-53s at Nakhon Phanom on 15-minute alert during daylight and 45-minute alert at night. In July 1974 Detachment 10 at Takhli was disbanded, followed in August by Detachment 3 at Ubon. On 20 February 1975, Detachment 1 at Nakhon Phanom was disbanded. At this time the 40th's force level had dropped to 8 HH-53Cs and 4 HH-43Fs. The 40th moved to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base on 1 October 1975. On 15 October 1975 with the inactivation of the 56th ARRS its 4 HC-130Ps joined the 40th. On 31 January 1976 the 40th ARRS was inactivated at Korat RTAFB. Operations and losses *30 May 1968, Jolly Green, an HH-3E was attempting to rescue Colonel Norman Phillips the pilot of a downed F-105, near Savannakhet, Laos. Pararescueman Sergeant Thomas A Newman descended into a hostile jungle environment to rescue the pilot. Hampered by darkness and concentrated automatic weapons fire, Newman requested the rescue helicopter to enter a nearby orbit, both for the safety of the crewmembers and to prevent the hovering aircraft from establishing their location for the unfriendly ground forces. When the HH-3 returned, he secured the injured Philips to the forest penetrator and protected him with his own body as they ascended to the helicopter. Newman was awarded the Air Force Cross. *25 December 1968, Jolly Green 17, an HH-3E was attempting to rescue Major Charles R Brownlee, the pilot of Panda 01 an F-105 shot down near Ban Lathama, Mahaxia District, Khammouan Province, Laos. Pararescueman Airman First Class Charles Douglas King descended by rescue hoist to rescue the injured pilot. With the pilot attached to the hoist, the HH-3E and King were hit by enemy fire, seriously injured, King instructed the helicopter to depart. King was posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross,. The bodies of King and Brownlee were not recovered and both were listed as killed in action - body not recovered. *18 January 1969, Jolly Green 67, HH-53B, 66-14430, was hit by ground fire while on a CSAR mission for Sandy 02, an A-1H lost the previous day. Helicopter made an emergency landing 15 km southeast of Tchepone, Laos. The crew and the A-1 pilot were rescued by Jolly Green 70. An airstrike was ordered to destroy JG-67 *28 January 1970, Jolly Green 71, HH-53B, 66-14434, on a CSAR mission for the pilot of Seabird 02, an F-105G, was shot down by a missile fired from a Mig-21 piloted by Vu Ngoc Dinh of the 921st Fighter Regiment. The 6-man crew were all killed. *30 June 1970, Jolly Green 54, HH-53C, 66-8283, was on a CSAR mission for the crew of Nail 44 an OV-10A, over Savannakhet, Laos. Abandoning the first rescue attempt due to heavy fire, the pilot Captain Leroy C Schaneberg decided to make a second rescue attempt. JG54 was hit by ground fire and crashed. The 5-man crew were all killed. The crash site was excavated in December 1993 and remains were identified as a group on 7 March 1995. Schaneberg was posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross. HH-53B of the 40th ARRS which participated in the Son Tay RaidAircraft, serial 68-10357, is pictured after it was converted to an MH-53M Pave Low IV. During the Son Tay raid its call sign was Apple 1. It is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force *21 November 1970, 5 of the squadron's HH-53s took part in Operation Ivory Coast, the raid on the Son Tay POW camp. *21 June 1971, Jolly Green 54, HH-53, 66‚Äì8285, was shot down over Laos while attempting to recover an AQM-34 Buffalo Hunter drone. Crew were all rescued. 21st SOS CH-53 in 1972 *27 March 1972, Jolly Green 61, HH-53C, 66-10359, crashed over Stoeng Treng Province, Cambodia, about southeast of Siem Pang District due to unknown causes. A pararescueman was lowered to the ground at the site of the crash to check for survivors, but due to the intense heat from the burning helicopter, he could not approach near enough to determine if there were crew members inside the aircraft. Some three hours later a second rescue specialist was deployed in the immediate area, who reported the wreckage was still burning, precluding close inspection. The 5-man crew were all killed in action - body not recovered. *13 April 1972, Captain Bennie D Orrell pilot of a Jolly Green, rescued a downed pilot near Tchepone, Laos. Orrell was awarded the Air Force Cross. *2 June 1972, Captain Dale E. Stovall pilot of a Jolly Green, flew through intense hostile ground fire to complete the rescue of Captain Roger Locher, an F-4 copilot who had evaded capture for 23 days after being shot down in North Vietnam. This rescue was the deepest CSAR mission into North Vietnam and took place 8 km northeast of Y√™n B√°i Air Base, one of the most active Vietnamese People's Air Force MiG airfields. Stovall was awarded a Bronze Oak leaf cluster in lieu of a second award of Silver Star. Stovall was also awarded the 1973 Jabara Award for Airmanship. *27 June 1972, Pararescueman Sergeant Charles D. McGrath was on a CSAR mission on Jolly Green 77 over North Vietnam. While penetrating dense jungle to rescue F-4 crewman, Captain Lynn A. Aikman, who had a broken leg, knee, elbow and jaw, McGrath exposed himself to intense ground fire in order to drag the incapacitated Aikman to a suitable recovery area. Seeing JG73 crippled by the hostile fire, he directed air strikes against surrounding hostile ground forces until he was able to secure CAikman and himself to the penetrator of Jolly Green 57, the backup helicopter. Rising through constant accurate ground fire, he shielded Aikman with his own body until they were successfully recovered. McGrath and the pilot Captain Dale Stovall were both awarded the Air Force Cross. *27 December 1972, Jolly Green 73, HH-53C, 66-10788, on a CSAR mission for crew of Jackel 33, an F-111A downed on 22 December 1972 over North Vietnam, lost its fuel probe due to enemy ground fire and crash-landed due to fuel starvation.

George's ancestor, Henry Lunt, was one of the original settlers of Newbury (1635). His grandfather's exploits with John Paul Jones were chronicled by James Fenimore Cooper.Cooper, James F. John Paul Jones (1846) Carey and Hart (via Naval Historical Center) Life George Lunt was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts on December 31, 1803. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy. He was graduated at Harvard College in 1824, with special distinction in Greek, studied law, and began practice in Newburyport in 1827. In earlier life Mr. Lunt was an active member of the Whig party, and in its interests was distinguished as a public speaker. On the dissolution of that party he became a Democrat. He was elected successively representative for Newburyport and senator from Essex County in the legislature, was an active member of the convention that nominated General Zachary Taylor for the presidency, and was appointed United States District Attorney for Massachusetts under Taylor's administration. He eventually resumed the private practice of his profession, devoting his leisure to literary pursuits. When the Whigs dissolved, he joined the Democrats. Prior to and during the Civil War he was editor of the Boston Courier in conjunction with George S. Hillard. He opposed policies which would estrange the South and defended slavery. When he returned to the practice of his profession, he appeared frequently in the state courts, and was counsel before congressional committees in reference to French claims, preparing a bill and efficiently pressing it for the action of congress. Mr. Lunt's later years were marked by labors in behalf of harbors of refuge, notably at Scituate, Massachusetts, on the south shore of Boston bay. By persevering effort he succeeded in securing very considerable appropriations from congress to this end. He was a man of firm convictions in both political and religious matters, and fearless and manly in their expression. As a writer his style was marked by strength, dignity, and grace.

Typically shown in rotundas for viewing, panoramas were meant to be so lifelike they confused the spectator between what was real and what was image. Creation of the Panorama Robert Barker conceived the concept of the panorama in 1787.Comment, Bernard. The Painted Panorama. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc, 1999. While walking on Calton Hill overlooking Edinburgh, the idea struck him and he obtained a patent for it the same year. Barker's patent included the first coining of the word panorama, a portmanteau of the Greek words ‚Äòpano‚Äô (all) and ‚Äòhorama‚Äô (view). Barker's vision was to capture the magnificence of a scene from every angle so as to immerse the spectator completely, and in so doing, blur the line where art stopped and reality began. Barker's first panorama was of Edinburgh. He exhibited the Panorama of Edinburgh From Calton Hill in his house in 1788, and later in Archers' Hall near the Meadows to public acclaim. The first panorama disappointed Barker, not because of its lack of success, but because it fell short of his vision. The Edinburgh scene was not a full 360 degrees; it was semi-circular. Annotated Video Tour of Robert Barker's Panorama of London in November 1790, taken from the roof of Albion Mills, SouthwarkAfter the commercial but limited technical success of his first panorama, Barker and his son Henry Aston Barker completed a panorama of London from the Albion Mills. A reduced version was originally shown in their house with a larger one on display later. Cross- section of the Rotunda in Leicester Square in which the panorama of London was exhibited (1801) To fulfill his dream of a 360 panorama, Barker and his son purchased a rotunda at Leicester Square. '' London from the Roof of the Albion Mills christened the new rotunda, all 250 square meters of it. The previously reduced version, in contrast, measured only 137 square meters. The rotunda at Leicester Square was composed of two levels, although they varied in size. Spectators observed the scenes from a platform in the center of the rotunda.Thomas, Sophie. \\"Making Visible: The Diorama, the Double and the (Gothic) subject.\\" Gothic Technologies: Visuality in the Romantic Era. Ed. Robert Miles. 2005. Praxis Series. 31 January 2010. . The main goal of the panorama was to immerse the audience to the point where they could not tell the difference between the canvas and reality, in other words, wholeness. To accomplish this, all borders of the canvas had to be concealed. Props were also strategically positioned in the foreground of the scene to increase realism. Two windows laid into the roof allowed natural light to flood the canvases, also making the illusion more realistic. Two scenes could be exhibited at the rotunda in Leicester Square simultaneously, however the rotunda at Leicester Square was the only rotunda to house two panoramas. Houses with single scenes proved more popular. While at Leicester Square, the audience was herded down a long, dark corridor to clear their minds. The idea was to have spectators more or less forget what they just saw, leaving their minds blank to view the second scene. Despite the audience's \\"mind blanking\\" walk in the dark, panoramas were designed to have a lingering effect upon the viewer. For some, this attribute placed panoramas in the same category as propaganda of the period: no more than an illusion meant to deceive. The panorama evolved somewhat and in 1809, the moving panorama graced the stage in Edinburgh.Wilcox, Scott. Panorama Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. 9 February 2010. Unlike its predecessor, the moving panorama required a large canvas and two vertical rollers. The scene or variation of scenes passed before the audience between the rollers, eliminating the need to showcase and view the panoramas in a rotunda. Peter Marshall added the twist to Barker's original creation, which saw success throughout the 19th and into the 20th century. Despite the success of the moving panorama, Barker's original vision maintained popularity through various artists, including Pierre Pr√©vost, Charles Langlois and Henri F√©lix Emmanuel Philippoteaux among others. The revival in popularity for the panorama peaked in the 1880s, having spread through Europe and North America. Cultural response In the late 18th and early 19th century, the panorama attracted a diverse audience partly because an extensive education was not required to view panoramas. On the contrary, it was an art form that could be appreciated by anyone mainly because they depicted scenes. People could immerse themselves in the scene and take part in what became known as the locality paradox.Ellis, Markman. Spectacles within doors: Panoramas of London in the 1790s. Romanticism 2008, Vol. 14 Issue 2. MLA International Bibliography Database. The locality paradox refers to the phenomenon where spectators are so taken with the panorama they cannot distinguish where they are: Leicester Square or, for example, the Albion Mills. This association with delusion was a common critique of panoramas. Writers feared the panorama for the simplicity of its illusion. Hester Piozzi was among those who rebelled against the growing popularity of the panorama for precisely this reason. She did not like seeing so many people ‚Äì distinguished and otherwise ‚Äì fooled by something so simple. Another problem with the panorama is what it came to be associated with, namely, it redefined the sublime to incorporate the material.Jones, Jennifer J. Absorbing Hesitation: Wordsworth and the Theory of the Panorama. Studies in Romanticism. 45:3, 2006. MLA International Bibliography Database By associating the sublime with the material, the panorama was seen as a threat ‚Äì the sublime was never supposed to include any materiality. The subjects of panoramas transformed as time passed, becoming less about the sublime and more about military battles and biblical scenes. This was especially true during the Napoleonic era when panoramas often displayed scenes from the emperor's latest battle whether a victory or a crushing defeat such as depicted in the Battle of Waterloo in 1816.Meisel, Martin. Realizations. New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1983. Panoramas and Romanticism In their earliest forms, panoramas depicted topographical scenes. Breathtaking sights immediately link panoramas with romanticism, which is known for its reverence toward the sublime. Despite this similarity, the poet William Wordsworth has long been associated as an opponent of the panorama, most notably for his allusion to it in Book Seven of The Prelude. It has been argued that Wordsworth's problem with the panorama was the deceit it involved. He felt, critics say, the panorama not only exhibited an immense scene of some kind, but also the weakness of human intelligence. It is safe to assume Wordsworth saw a panorama at some point during his life, but it is unknown which it was. Situation as it is, there is no substantial proof he ever went, but his response to it seems too grounded upon experience to suggest otherwise. Wordsworth's opposition is to the awe- inspiring scenes of the panorama and of other spectacles of the period that competed with such scenes in real life.Miles, Robert. \\"Introduction: Gothic Romance as Visual Technology.\\" Gothic Technologies: Visuality in the Romantic Era. Ed. Robert Miles. 2005. Praxis Series. 31 January 2010. . He sought to separate poetry from the phantasmagoria enveloping the population. This was perhaps Wordsworth's biggest problem with panoramas: their popularity.Haut, Asia. \\"Reading the Visual.\\" Oxford Art Journal: 32, 2, 2009. For Wordsworth, panoramas more or less brainwashed their audiences. The panorama lulled spectators into stupors, inhibiting their ability to imagine things for themselves. Wordsworth wanted people to see the representation and appreciate it for what it was ‚Äì art. Conversely, J. Jennifer Jones argues Wordsworth was not opposed to the panorama, but rather hesitant about it. In her essay, \\"Absorbing Hesitation: Wordsworth and the Theory of the Panorama\\", Jones argues that other episodes of The Prelude have just as much sensory depth as panoramas are supposed to have had. Jones studied how Wordsworth imitated the senses in The Prelude, much in the same way panoramas did. She concluded that panoramas were a balancing act between what the senses absorbed and what they came away with, something also present in Wordsworth's poetry. By her results then, Wordsworth's similar imitation of the senses proves he was not entirely opposed to them.

Dempsey, MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company, 2001, History Bill Colgan, founder of Colgan Custom Manufacturing, Inc. successfully operated a trim and upholstery business in Burbank, California, for fifteen years prior to creating the car bra business. The \\"Original Car Bra\\" was invented in 1961 when three German engineers from Lockheed walked into Bill's upholstery shop, asking Colgan if he could redesign a protective cover for their personal Porsches. The very first pattern was for the Porsche 356. The first order for the protective covers for the cars‚Äô front fascia (a.k.a. ‚Äòcar bras‚Äô) was for 12 units. After that, he was asked to make 150. Yet, after the second order was given to the buyers, he stopped making car bras, in order to concentrate on the main business. And only by the mid-1970s he realized that this business took over upholstery, and he concentrated on car bras production, having given this name to his invention. The pattern Colgan designed was the creation of the one-piece \\"Original Car Bra.\\"\\"A Brief History of the 'Bra' by Colgan\\" , Bill Colgan, 1988\\"Car Bras Research Guide\\" , AutoAnything, retrieved 2010-2-9 The word 'bra' came from the woman's breast-support undergarment, the brassiere. The peak years of popularity of the front-end car bra were the 1980s and 1990s in the United States. Types There are several types of car bras, including full, sport, and T-style. The 'sport' car bra covers less of the front of the vehicle (displaying more of the car's original looks) than the 'full'. The 'T-style' car bra is generally intended for trucks, SUVs and similar.\\"Car Bras For New Fashion\\", Andrew Bernhardt, streetdirectory.com\\"A Guide to the Car Bra\\", Waxner, 12 December 2008 The car bra can also be carbon-based, ostensibly to absorb the microwaves used in police radar equipment and thus minimize the risk of detection when speeding. Car bras are most commonly black in color, but are available in other colors to match the color of the vehicle. The 'clear' car bra is actually a stick-on, transparent, protective film that can extend from the front end over the entire car body. Some automobile manufacturers use larger bras together with disguising panels, plastic and/or tape to cover an entire vehicle (or certain parts of it) to conceal its design when developing and road-testing.

It originally aired on February 8, 2010. In a nod to CBS hosting that year's Super Bowl, the episode features NFL commentators Jim Nantz and Phil Simms in guest appearances as themselves. Plot Ted, Marshall, Lily, and Robin hang out at Ted's apartment to watch Super Bowl XLIV, where the camera catches Barney holding up a sign in the crowd asking women to call him. It pays off as his phone keeps ringing with women on the other end. He hires Ranjit as his personal driver. Robin also reveals that, while they were on the air, she accepted an offer from her colleague, Don (Ben Koldyke), to go on a Valentine's Day date. The gang debates whether Robin is attracted to Don using the duck-rabbit illusion. This leads to an intense fight among the group, with Marshall supporting rabbits as an object of desire, and Ted, Robin, Lily and Ranjit supporting ducks. Marshall eventually concedes the point. Given the success of Ranjit's arranged marriage, Ted decides to let Marshall and Lily pick his Valentine's Day date. Ted joins Robin at Don's apartment, as Don said there would be a party. Ted leaves when he sees Don on the couch naked, attempting The Naked Man. Robin confronts Don and he admits he is interested in her but didn't know how to say. However, she sees him with a large pair of rabbit ears. Meanwhile, Barney has problems with his pickup phone. When he is about to bed one woman, another calls. This causes him to ditch the woman and have Ranjit drive him back to MacLaren's on three separate occasions. On the fourth incident, involving a woman named Natalia, Barney throws the phone in the dumpster so he can concentrate on her, but he continues to hear the phone ringing in the distance (in the manner of Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart) and goes to retrieve it. Marshall and Lily hide the phone, and later Ted finds it and answers. Ted goes on the double date with Marshall and Lily, who have fixed him up with Natalia (Bar Paly). Despite their compatibility, Ted continues to answer the phone, which results in another encounter at MacLaren's. Barney tries to take the phone from Ted, but Ted passes it to Marshall and Lily, who drops the phone in a pitcher of beer. While Robin prepares for her show, Don apologizes for his behavior and praises her anchor skills. He also tries to improve his work ethic by bringing Robin coffee. She later imagines a duck bill on his face. Critical response Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode with a grade A, while Cindy McLennan of Television Without Pity gave it a C+. Brian Zoromski of IGN gave the episode 9 out of 10. TV Fanatic gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars, praising the dialogue, while Time praised Neil Patrick Harris's acting.

Antebellum architecture (meaning \\"prewar\\", from the Latin ante, \\"before\\", and bellum, \\"war\\") is the neoclassical architectural style characteristic of the 19th- century Southern United States, especially the Deep South, from after the birth of the United States with the American Revolution, to the start of the American Civil War. Antebellum architecture is especially characterized by Georgian, Neo-classical, and Greek Revival style homes and mansions. These elegant mansions were built in the southern American states during roughly the thirty years before the American Civil War; approximately between the 1830s to 1860s. Key features Exterior: The main characteristics of antebellum architecture viewed from the outside of the house often included huge pillars, a balcony that ran along the whole outside edge of the house created a porch that offers shade and a sitting area, evenly spaced large windows, and big center entrances at the front and rear of the house to add to the box-like style of the mansion. A hipped or gabled roof are characteristics of antebellum architecture and often feature a cupola. A cupola is a dome-like structure on top of a building. It is functional as it provides ventilation but is also decorative. These mansions also often included grand gardens with geometrically cut bushes to complement the symmetry of the house. Antebellum architectural structures have multiple stories or levels. Interior: The interior of these mansions were just as extravagant as the outside. Common features included enormous foyers, sweeping open stairways, ballrooms, grand dining rooms, and intricate design work. The design work included intricate shapes and patterns made from plaster used to adorn walls and furniture. It was also used to create wood and floor designs. Designs additionally include friezes, large pier mirrors, and marble mantles. Greek revival components apparent in antebellum architecture includes doorways often recessed and glorified by columns of correct proportions, appropriate pilasters, and heavy entablatures. Similarly, Georgian architecture is illustrated similarly with highly decorated entrances flanked by thin colonnades including a lunette over the door. Examples The Herndon Glanton Reeves house, built in 1845 in Troup County, Georgia, was home to several prominent citizens and used as a hospital for both Confederate and Union soldiers during the Civil War. The detail on the staircase newel and on the wall are both common features of antebellum architecture. Many plantation houses still standing are of this style, including: *Barrington Hall in Roswell, Georgia *Belle Grove Plantation in Iberville Parish, Louisiana, the largest plantation house ever built in the South. *Belle Meade Plantation in Belle Meade, Tennessee *Boone Hall, near Charleston, South Carolina; built in 1936, but in the antebellum style. *Bulloch Hall in Roswell, Georgia *Carnton Plantation in Franklin, Tennessee *Evergreen Plantation in Wallace, Louisiana *Gamble Plantation Historic State Park in Ellenton, Florida *Glen Mary Plantation in Sparta, Georgia *Goodman- LeGrand House in Tyler, Texas *Hunter-Dawson Home in New Madrid, Missouri *Longwood in Natchez, Mississippi *Millford Plantation in Pinewood, South Carolina *Monmouth Plantation, in Natchez, Mississippi *Myrtles Plantation, in St. Francisville, Louisiana *Nottoway Plantation in White Castle, Louisiana *Oak Alley Plantation in Vacherie, Louisiana *Orton Plantation in Brunswick County, North Carolina *Rippavilla Plantation in Spring Hill, Tennessee *Rosedown Plantation in St. Francisville, Louisiana *The Grove Plantation in Tallahassee, Florida *The Hermitage, near Nashville, Tennessee *Ward Hall in Georgetown, Kentucky *Waverley in West Point, Mississippi History The features associated with antebellum architecture were introduced by people of British descent who settled in the Southern states during the colonial period and in U.S. territories after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 along with a wave of immigration from Europe in 1812. Great numbers of Europeans seeking economic opportunities emigrated to America after Napoleon's defeat and the end of the war of 1812. This new wave of entrepreneurs began to dominate not only the economy, but also the architecture of the first half of the 19th century. A prime example of the influence of immigrants in antebellum architecture is Stanton Hall. The Hall was built by Frederick Stanton, an immigrant from Ireland who made his fortune in trading cotton. The design was based on the Revival style. The Hall also goes to show the increasingly connected national and global economy in which antebellum architecture emerged. The house used mantel pieces from New York, gasoliers from Philadelphia, and mirrors from France. Similar to many antebellum homes, Stanton Hall was built using a fortune Stanton made trading cotton. During the Civil War, like many other plantation houses, the Hall was occupied by Union soldiers. President Andrew Jackson's home the Hermitage is another prime example of both antebellum architecture and the social conditions in which it arose. It was built in the Federal Style which, while losing favor in the more trendy East, was still popular in Western slave states like Tennessee. Later, renovations made the house more in line with contemporary styles, adding Doric columns and making it more Classical and Revivalist in appearance. Like other homes of its time, the Hermitage was built in a symmetrical design with equal amounts of corridors and rooms. Not just reflecting the cultural differences between the West and East in this time, the Hermitage also was part of the South's economy. The Hermitage was an active plantation which grew the period's dominant cash crop, cotton. Georgia's Old Governor's Mansion is one of the finest examples of the High Greek Revival architecture of this period. The mansion, located in Milledgeville, was designed by Charles Cluskey, an Irish immigrant who emigrated to New York City in 1827 where he trained to be an architect under the firm Town and Davis, and was built by Timothy Porter in 1839. Like other antebellum homes, this mansion has Ionic columns, a covered porch, and symmetrically placed windows. For over thirty years, this mansion housed many Georgian chief executives such as George Crawford, Howell Cobb and Joseph E. Brown. It was used as a stage for their speeches, and a place to introduce important guests. This mansion also played a part in the Civil War; General William T. Sherman headquartered in the building in 1864 and it was claimed as a prize in the \\"March to the Sea.\\" After the war, the mansion was abandoned when Georgia's government was moved to Atlanta. After the Civil War, the upkeep of these homes was strained. Stanton Hall, for example, was owned by the descendants of Stanton for several decades after the Civil War, but eventually the financial burden was too much and it became the Stanton College for Young Ladies. Today most antebellum buildings serve as museums. These museums, especially the museums located at former plantations, often attempt to show both sides of the architectural style. While celebrating the beauty of the buildings, they also tell the story of the slaves who worked the land. Boone Hall is a prime example of modern antebellum museums. The museum uses nine of the original slave cabins built between 1790 and 1810 as part of its \\"Black History in America\\" exhibit. In the exhibit, each cabin presents different aspects of slave life on the plantation. While the style's history remains controversial, exhibits like these are important in exposing the public to America's history with slavery.  In modern society  An estimated 20% of antebellum mansions remain intact in the south today due to many being burned during the Civil War, natural disasters, and their neglect. Many antebellum homes are now museums; Georgia's Old Governor's Mansion is an example of this. The mansion belongs to Georgia College, and is its most treasured structure. In 2001, the structure began its restoration, and now serves as a museum that exhibits artefacts and gardens that showcase its history. Tours are available today that focus on the history of the building, gardens, and artefacts. The mansion was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the South and damaged or destroyed many antebellum buildings. This destruction once again raised the question of whether or not these buildings, as symbols of a wealthy society propped up by slavery, should be preserved. For example, Grass Lawn, an antebellum mansion in Gulfport, Mississippi, was totally destroyed by the hurricane. As the community began to raise funds to rebuild the mansion, it faced resistance from parts of the community who opposed the symbolism of the mansion. Though it eventually passed through city council, the bill funding the reconstruction was at first even voted down. Many prime example of antebellum architecture did not receive the same support as Grass Lawn. In the wake of Katrina, cleanups of cities often did not follow the guidelines of the National Historic Preservation Act. Hundreds of properties were destroyed with little hope of being reconstructed or commemorated. There are movements however, to preserve these historic properties. FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) for example helps to preserve important architectural properties, especially those affected by Katrina.

The GM-1 molecule lowers the elevated level of interleukin 1 and significantly raises the amount of interleukin 2 cytokines; this balances the body immune system thus making it stronger against pain, fever, inflammation, diarrhea, bacterial and viral infection, atherosclerosis, aging, arthritis, mouth ulcer, intestinal ulcer, stomach ulcer and cancer‚Äîas tested in laboratory and on test subjects successfully. A formula has been prepared using extracts of five Thai fruits and grains that reduces the effects of the cytokine storm that is the main cause of death by respiratory viruses or airborne viruses. The researchers believe that this formula can help prevent the fatality from all types of respiratory viruses, like H1N1 and the possible mutated strains in the future.

This resulted in criticism from the audience, who said that the series resembled a Chiung Yao drama where there are often unnecessary and exaggerated conflicts inserted into the storyline.

He is also notable for his drawings, watercolours and engravings. Biography Eekman was born in Brussels in the house where Victor Hugo wrote Les Mis√©rables. At 18, Eekman gave his first lecture in Brussels titled The unknown Van Gogh who in 1907 was an unacknowledged artist by the general public. In 1912, he went to see the first Van Gogh exhibition in Cologne, Germany. After graduating as an architect from the Fine Arts Academy in Brussels, he took refuge during the First World War in the presbytery of Nuenen, where Bart de Ligt was a pastor. Thirty years earlier, the Van Gogh family lived in the same presbytery, where Vincent created The Potato Eaters. Up until the end the war, Eekman exhibited his work frequently in Dutch museums and collectors purchased some of his artwork, primarily Helene Kr√∂ller-M√ºller. A few months after a great retrospective at the Reflets Gallery in Brussels, he died on 13 November 1973 in Paris. He was buried at the Ivry Cemetery. Career as an artist After settling in Paris in 1921, Eekman continued showing his art in France and abroad. He was an acquaintance of Fred Klein, Piet Mondrian, C√©sar Domela, Georges Vantongerloo and Frans Masereel. He became friends with gallerist Jeanne Bucher who in 1928 exhibited his work along with Mondrian's. This would be the only time that Mondrian's paintings would be exhibited in a gallery in Paris. They were close friends. During the 1930s, Eekman participated in many group exhibitions, mainly in the United States, and his solo exhibitions took place all over Europe. In the interwar period, Eekman was part of the artistic movement that revolved around Montparnasse. There he became friends with Jean Lur√ßat, Louis Marcoussis, Andr√© Lhote, Marc Chagall, Picasso, Dal√≠, Fernand L√©ger and Max Ernst, among others. In 1937, at the International Exhibition in Paris, Eekman won the gold medal for his painting La pelote bleue, which was purchased by the State for the Jeu de Paume Museum. In the beginning of World War II, he was sought by the Nazis and settled momentarily in Saint-Jean-de- Luz, where he signed his work under the Ekma pseudonym. In 1944, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts in Brussels organized a significant exhibition in which he participated, which the Queen Elisabeth of Belgium attended. At the International Exhibition in Deauville in 1956 he was awarded the Nude Art Prize. In 1961, an important fresco (2.50 x 1.40 m. ‚Äì 8.2 x 4.5 ft.) of medicinal plants from around the world was commissioned to Eekman by Prof. H. Griffon and was completed for Paris Orly Airport's drugstore. Legacy His daughter Luce Eekman founded the non-profit organization Le Sillon Nicolas Eekman in 1989 to exhibit his work and foster continuing interest in his art. Several exhibitions were held in France and in the Netherlands. A catalogue raisonn√© of his work is currently in preparation.

War service Halliday studied at William Ellis School and University College School before volunteering in 1939 for the Royal Navy. While he awaited his call-up papers, he worked as a trawler deck-hand on Breadwinner, out of Lowestoft. Initially entering service in 1941 as a naval rating at at Skegness, Halliday was offered a commission as an officer in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and training as a naval airman. His air training took place in the United States (still formally neutral at that time) at the naval air station at Grosse Ile, near Detroit and at Pensacola, Florida. After qualifying, he was posted to a squadron of Grumman Avengers, aboard the escort carrier in the Gulf of Mexico. Fleet Air Arm Avenger After three months period on anti-submarine patrols in the north Atlantic, Halliday was posted to a shore station, RNAS Hatston in Orkney, guarding against sorties by German warships. In late 1943, Halliday's squadron was embarked on ; they sailed for the Far East, arriving at Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in January 1944. There were air raids on Japanese installations and in support of 14th Army operations. Halliday had transferred to by the time of the Meridian air raids by the British Pacific Fleet on oil refineries near Palembang on 24 January. Halliday's aircraft was shot up during the raid and he was obliged to \\"ditch\\" his burning aircraft in the sea; he was rescued by . Whelp's first lieutenant, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, lent Halliday a spare uniform and subsequently accompanied him on a \\"run ashore\\" in Fremantle. Halliday was back on Victorious in time to take part in the raids on the airfields on the Sakishima Islands in March to May 1945, for his efforts, he was awarded a DSC in addition to the Mention in Dispatches earned during Operation Meridian. After the Japanese surrender, Halliday learned that his cabin-mate, Ken Burrenston, who had been shot down over Palembang, had been beheaded by the Japanese at Changi, two days after the Japanese surrender. Post-war Halliday returned to Britain on the troopship Rangitiki with his squadron commander, David Foster, who subsequently became president of Colgate-Palmolive. On return to the UK, he was offered, and accepted, a permanent commission in the Royal Navy (16 March 1946) and took up a post as a test pilot at Boscombe Down. There followed several postings to naval units: commander of 813 Naval Air Squadron on ; commander of (a base at Hythe, Hampshire); senior officer of the 104th Minesweeping Squadron in the Far East. The 104th swept left-over Japanese mines in the Celebes Sea and chased pirates, who desisted once the ready use of capital punishment by the civil authorities became known. The next appointment was for two years as naval assistant to the Chief of Naval Information at the Admiralty. During this time, Halliday closed down a leak of information to the press. Another sea posting ensued in 1964, as second in command of commando carrier and commander of its air operations, for which he learnt to fly helicopters. Albion was a busy posting, supporting operations in the Radfan and Aden and in Borneo during the Indonesian Confrontation. Halliday was appointed Deputy Director Naval Air Warfare in 1966, Captain Far East Fleet and Western Fleet in 1970 and Commodore Amphibious Warfare in 1971. He went on to be Commodore Intelligence in 1973, Naval Attach√© and Commander of the British Navy Staff in Washington D.

The French Revolution: A History Volume I. London: J.M. Dent and Sons, Ltd, 1906. Pp. viii-xi, 45-50. Romanticism continued to grow in reaction to the effects of the social transformation caused by the Revolution. There are many signs of these effects of the French Revolution in various pieces of Romantic literature. By examining the influence of the French Revolution, one can determine that Romanticism arose as a reaction to the French Revolution. Instead of searching for rules governing nature and human beings, the romantics searched for a direct communication with nature and treated humans as unique individuals not subject to scientific rules.  The influence of the French Revolution  The French Revolution played a huge role in influencing Romantic writers. As the Revolution began to play out, the absolute monarchy that had ruled France for centuries collapsed in only three years. This resulted in a complete transformation of society. A majority of the population was greatly in favor of this as the working class had been suffering oppression for many years. According to Albert Hancock, in his book The French Revolution and the English Poets: a study in historical criticism, \\"The French Revolution came, bringing with it the promise of a brighter day, the promise of regenerated man and regenerated earth. It was hailed with joy and acclamation by the oppressed, by the ardent lovers of humanity, by the poets, whose task it is to voice the human spirit.\\"Hancock, Albert Elmer. The French Revolution and the English Poets: A Study in Historical Criticism. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1899. Pp. 7, 45-79. A common theme among some of the most widely known romantic poets is their acceptance and approval of the French Revolution. William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, and Percy Shelley all shared the same view of the French Revolution as it being the beginning of a change in the current ways of society and helping to improve the lives of the oppressed. As the French Revolution changed the lives of virtually everyone in the nation and even continent because of its drastic and immediate shift in social reformation, it greatly influenced many writers at the time. Hancock writes, \\"There is no need to recount here in detail how the French Revolution, at the close of the last century, was the great stimulus to the intellectual and emotional life of the civilized world, how it began by inspiring all liberty-loving men with hope and joy.\\" Literature began to take a new turn when the spirit of the revolution caught the entire nation and turned things in a whole new direction. The newly acquired freedom of the common people did not only bring about just laws and living but ordinary people also had the freedom to think for themselves, and in turn the freedom to express themselves. Triggered by the revolutionary spirit, the writers of the time were full of creative ideas and were waiting for a chance to unleash them. Under the new laws writers and artists were given a considerable amount of freedom to express themselves which did well to pave the way to set a high standard for literature.Gregory, Allene. \\"The French Revolution and the English Novel\\". New York: The Knickerbocker Press, 1915. Pp. v-viii, 15-48, 270-282. Prior to the French Revolution, poems and literature were typically written about and to aristocrats and clergy, and rarely for or about the working man. However, when the roles of society began to shift resulting from the French Revolution, and with the emergence of Romantic writers, this changed.Daiches, David. A Critical History of English Literature, Volume 2. New York: Ronald Press Co., 1960. Pp. 860-875. Romantic poets such as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley started to write works for and about the working man; pieces that the common man could relate to. According to Christensen, \\"To get the real animating principle of the Romantic Movement, one must not study it inductively or abstractly; one must look at it historically. It must be put beside the literary standards of the eighteenth century. These standards impose limits upon the Elysian fields of poetry; poetry must be confined to the common experience of average men‚Ä¶ The Romantic Movement then means the revolt of a group of contemporary poets who wrote, not according to common and doctrinaire standards, but as they individually pleased‚Ä¶ there are no principles comprehensive and common to all except those of individualism and revolt.\\"Christensen, Jerome. Romanticism at the End of History. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000. Pp. 9-20, 72-74.  A closer look at the influence of the French Revolution on selected Romantic poets  Although the poets mentioned earlier (Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley) all share the common theme of approving the French Revolution, they each have their own unique ideas regarding the Revolution itself that have greatly shaped their work. This can be seen by analyzing some of each of their works.  Shelley  Ever since he was young, Percy Shelley was very nontraditional. He was born a freethinker and \\"in spite of all his lovable and generous traits he was a born disturber of the public peace\\". At school he was known as \\"Mad Shelley, the Atheist\\". According to Hancock, \\"The Goddess of Revolution rocked his cradle.\\" Throughout his life Shelley's opposition toward religion grew less violent; however, he never professed a belief in immortality or religion of any sort.Dieterle, Bernard, Engel, Manfred, and Gillespie, Gerald. \\"Romantic Prose Fiction\\". Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2008. Pp. 1-21. His poems declare a belief in the permanence of things that are true and beautiful. Common themes that Shelley incorporated into his works include the hatred of kings, faith in the natural goodness of man, the belief in the corruption of present society, the power of reason, the rights of natural impulse, the desire for a revolution, and liberty, equality and fraternity. These are all clearly shaped by the French Revolution.  Byron  While Shelley had faith that was founded upon modern ideas, Byron had faith in nothing. He stood for only destruction. Because of this he was not a true revolutionist and was rather \\"the arch- apostle of revolt, of rebellion against constituted authority.\\" This statement is easily defended as Byron admitted that he resisted authority but offered no substitute. This is supported by what Byron once wrote, \\"I deny nothing‚Ä¶ but I doubt everything.\\" He then said later in life, \\"I have simplified politics into an utter detestation of all existing governments.\\" Towne, Edward Cornelius. Library of the World's Best Literature: Biographical Dictionary. New York: R. S. Peale and J. A. Hill Publishers, 1898. Byron believed neither in democracy nor in equality, but opposed all forms of tyranny and all attempts of rulers to control man. In Byron's poetry, he incorporated deep feeling, rather than deep thinking, to make his characters strong. Often, Byron portrayed his characters as being in complete harmony with nature, causing the character to lose himself in the immensity of the world. The French Revolution played a huge role in shaping Byron's beliefs and opposition to monarchy.  Wordsworth  While Shelley and Byron both proved to support the revolution to the end, both Wordsworth and Coleridge joined the aristocrats in fighting it.Page, Curtis Hidden. British Poets of the Nineteenth Century. New York: Benj. H. Sanborn & Co., 1918. Pp. v-vii. Wordsworth, however is the Romantic poet who has most profoundly felt and expressed the connection of the soul with nature. He saw great value in the immediate contact with nature. The French Revolution helped to humanize Wordsworth as his works transitioned from extremely natural experiences to facing the realities and ills of life, including society and the Revolution. From then on, his focus became the interests of man rather than the power and innocence of nature.  Coleridge  Samuel Taylor Coleridge was also profoundly affected by the French revolution. Unlike Wordsworth, Coleridge was more open and receptive to the social and political world around him. He was a very versatile man and he led a life that covered many fields and his work displayed this. He was a poet of nature, romance, and the Revolution. He was a philosopher, a historian, and a political figure. The French Revolution played a great role in shaping Coleridge into each of these things. According to Albert Hancock, Coleridge tended to focus his life on two things. The first, being to separate himself from the surrounding world and to submerge himself in thought, as a poet. The second, to play a role in the world's affairs, as a philosopher, historian, and politician, as mentioned earlier.

It was the second album released under his name, and his first album on the Impulse! label. It was recorded on November 15, 1966 at Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs, NJ, four days after the concert heard on the John Coltrane album Offering: Live at Temple University, and was released in 1967, after the death of Coltrane, with whom Sanders had played since 1965. Tauhid was reissued in 2017 on Anthology Recordings. The album marks guitarist Sonny Sharrock's first appearance on a record, as well as one of pianist Dave Burrell's earliest recordings. In the album liner notes, Sanders wrote: \\"I don't really see the horn anymore. I'm trying to see myself. And similarly, as to the sounds I get, it's not that I'm trying to scream on my horn, I'm just trying to put all my feelings into the horn. And when you do that, the notes go away... Why [do] I want clusters [of notes]? So that I [can] get more feeling, more of me, into every note I play. You see, everything you do has to mean something, has to be more than just notes. That's behind everything I do ‚Äì trying to get more ways of getting feeling out.\\" Reception Gary Giddins referred to Tauhid as \\"the first and best of Pharoah Sanders's Impulse albums.\\" Chris May, writing for All About Jazz, called Tauhid \\"arguably the finest statement in [Sanders'] astral oeuvre,\\" and states that \\"Of all Sanders' Impulse! albums... Tauhid has the best sound.\\" In his review for AllMusic, Al Campbell notes that \\"Sanders' tenor appearance doesn't saturate the atmosphere on this session; far from it. Sanders is content to patiently let the moods of these three pieces develop...\\" Writing on the Red Bull Music Academy web site, Andy Beta stated: \\"Drawing on his travels through Japan with Coltrane's group, as well as his reading about ancient Egypt, Tauhid balanced the incendiary sax shredding of Sanders' years with Coltrane with a newfound lyricism and patience, letting each song unfold at a natural pace. And with the guitar of Sonny Sharrock adding both furious noise and nimble R&B; chording that gave the sidelong 'Upper Egypt & Lower Egypt' its melodic hook, Sanders' work began to resonate beyond jazz as the Stooges and MC5 incorporated the spirit of Sanders into their proto-punk sound.\\" Will Schube called Tauhid \\"a perceptive insight into Sanders' mission, balancing jazz's studious technical aspects with a contemplative verve that lends his playing a striking looseness. It's in this balance that Sanders has remained an inspiration for the modern incarnations of spiritual jazz. Sanders' style is at once both deconstructive and innovative. Taking the tenants of jazz, he works backwards, stripping its tropes bare and rebuilding the genre in his own image. The playing strikes a balance, constantly driving yet stripped-down in its search for a capital-t Truth... Sanders was working in a style of jazz out-there enough for the most adventurous of listeners, but in control of his vision to such a thorough degree that even the most casual of jazz fans could find a lick, a melody, or a solo to latch onto.\\" In a review for Pitchfork, Daniel Martin-McCormick wrote: \\"Tauhid... plays like a mission statement. At the helm of an all-star sextet... Sanders leads the group through three pieces that transcend the traditional 'head/solo/head' structure... On Tauhid, the pieces are suites that play like seances, with movements billowing and unfolding of their own accord. The group's unity is powerful, creating a spiritual atmosphere that casts a spell from the opening bars.\\" Track listing All songs written by Pharaoh Sanders #\\"Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt\\" ‚Äì 16:12 #\\"Japan\\" ‚Äì 3:22 #\\"Medley: Aum/Venus/Capricorn Rising\\" ‚Äì 14:46 Personnel *Pharoah Sanders‚Äì tenor saxophone, alto saxophone, piccolo, vocals *Nat Bettis‚Äì percussion *Roger Blank‚Äì drums *Dave Burrell‚Äì piano *Henry Grimes‚Äì stand-up bass *Sonny Sharrock‚Äì guitar References Category:1966 albums Category:Albums produced by Bob Thiele Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio Category:Impulse!

History The barangay was named after Victoria Montesa, wife of the first Barrio Captain and one of the first settlers of the barrio. The first settlers were from the three distinct families, Montesa, Mugoy and Montoya, whose descendants still own the vast majority of land in the barrio. However, some tracts of land have changed hands considerably due to financial considerations and population impact. The first settlers cleared the land of trees and planted rice and vegetables. Everybody is helping one another as workers are difficult to come by on those days. One of the homesteaders, Domingo Pupa Mugoy, literally used his bare hands to uproot the trees that dotted his homestead with the help of his stepsons, from his second wife, Espiridiona Montoya,wife of one of the early homesteaders. Land was fertile and blessed with overflowing water from the rivers and creeks surrounding their lands. Barrio Victoria then was still under the administration of the Municipality of Mansalay, and Victoria is considered as a sitio of Barrio Paclasan, now Roxas. Geography and people As of 01 August 2007, the barangay have a population of 1,897.as per NSCB It is considered as a rural area. The barangay is a typical idyllic place you can see in most rural towns in the Philippines. The barrio have one major barangay road leading to the elementary school. The road is now cemented up until the barangay hall from the main highway. The National Highway traverses the outer boundaries of the barangay. The barangay is inhabited by migrants from Romblon, Aklan, Antique, Iloilo, Marinduque and Batangas. Economy The economy of Victoria rests solely on agriculture, mostly palay (rice). But about 25 years ago, coconut farms also thrived, however, due to population increase, many coconut farms were turned into housing sites and subdivided into lots especially those near the National highway. Household income of the majority of inhabitants are below poverty level and there are very few business enterprise, with mostly small groceries and sari-sari stores dominating the business landscape. Most dwellings are made of light materials and a few concrete houses. A major portion of the populace work in the rice farms surrounding the areas. A few have decided to work overseas and these are evident in their houses. There is one rice mill and a piggery operation. Education There is one elementary school, Victoria Elementary School, located near the riverbank offering complete basic education from kindergarten to Grade 6. During the early days, children have to travel by foot or any means of transport to the nearest complete elementary school in either Libertad, about 3 km away or San Aquilino about 4 km away, to enable them to finish their elementary schooling. Secondary schools are mostly located in the town of Roxas, but the nearest government secondary school is at the next barangay of San Aquilino. Health There is an existing health clinic in the barangay, primarily manned by Barangay Health Workers who are trained that can be relied upon for minor ailments and accidents. However, municipal health workers also visits the barangay once a week to dispense medicine and conduct primary health care functions. Entertainment In the olden days before electricity, the primary and sole means of entertainment was the barrio benefit dance, held once a week, usually during a Saturday or Fridays, especially if the barrio fiesta is forthcoming. Young men and women, gather at the barrio basketball court (sometimes the only paved space in the barrio), for a night of dancing and fun. Clad in their Sunday's best, with slippers and worn out shoes, they will frolic the night away until the wee hours of the morning of the next day. The dance is mainly for fund raising for a certain local beauty candidate as beauty pageants in the rural areas differs from beauty contest that we normally knows. In the barrios, these dances are used to raise funds for fiesta, of which the candidates for Miss Victoria will win not by beauty alone but by how much money she can raise for the fiesta. Thus it is not always the most beautiful who wins these contests. Music is provided by a portable amplifier and turntable, run by car batteries, with vinyl records before the advent of Cassette tape and Compact Disc. Music can be heard even kilometers away as there was hardly any noise during the night except the music blaring from the basketball court. This attracted even the young men and occasionally, young women from neighboring barrios. During Martial Law, a general permit and curfew pass for all those who are attending must be secured from local Military detachment in order to celebrate such barrio dance. People are then advised that those living far away from the venue must remain until 4 am in the premises to avoid being caught by the Military and police forces during curfew, which starts from 12-4 am. But times have changed for the better. Mobile disco and lights with their contemporary dance tunes dominates the landscape. Due to population increase, the entertainment have up its ante. There are now TV sets in almost all households and videoke machines blared during celebrations in and around the barrio. Computers are now a familiar gadgets and smartphones can be seen even in the ricefields. Religion The residents belongs to different religious denomination, majority of which are Catholics, followed by Iglesia Ni Kristo and other Christian denominations. There is a Catholic chapel, opposite side of the river near the elementary school in a lot donated by Mr. Jimmy Gadon, former barangay councilor. The first fiesta, in reverence to the Patron Saints, the Holy Family, was held on 27 December 1974,with the first Mass celebrated at the home of the then SSGT, now 2LT (Ret)Teodulfo P. Casa, PAF who also served as a barangay chairman for 2 terms after retiring from the military (he died on 5 Feb 2012) and Feliciana Mugoy, daughter of Domingo Mugoy and Espiridiona Montoya, the first settlers of the barrio, as the Chapel was not built yet by then.

The microstructuring systems like photolithography tools are used for manufacturing of processors, memory chips, MEMS, LED and other micro system devices. SUSS MicroTec is headquartered in Garching bei M√ºnchen, Germany. The stock ticker is SMHN.DE.  History  In 1949, Karl S√ºss founded the company Karl S√ºss KG to support sales and service for optical devices made by Ernst-Leitz GmbH, later Leica, in Munich, Germany. Then in 1963 the assignment by Siemens to develop a simple photolithography tool marked a change in the strategic direction of the company towards contract manufacturing and engineering. With the creation of the MJB3, the first mask aligner now exhibited in the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the company entered the emerging semiconductor industry. In addition to manual and automatic alignment equipment the product portfolio extended to systems for related wafer processing steps such as development, cleaning and wafer bonding. The company expanded into the global market with the foundation of its first overseas subsidiaries in the 1980s. In 1999 under the holding S√úSS MicroTec AG, the SUSS group went public on the German stock exchange. In 2002 all subsidiaries were renamed SUSS MicroTec.  Organization  In 1980 a production site for wafer bonders was founded in Waterbury, Vermont, US, and in 1989, a production site opened for test systems in Sacka near Dresden, Germany. The acquisition of the French company S.E.T. in 1993 complemented the product portfolio with spin coaters and device bonders, the latter product line was phased out in 2007. With the acquisition of Image Technology in Palo Alto, California, US, high precision photomasks were provided for the lithographic processes. In 2002 the foundation of SUSS MicroOptics in Neuchatel, Switzerland, brought forward wafer-level produced optical devices such as micro lenses. With the sale of the test systems division and the purchase of HamaTech APE early in 2010, SUSS MicroTec not only expands its expertise in wet processes but further focuses its core competence on micro structuring of devices. In 2012 SUSS MicroTec acquires Tamarack Scientific Co. Inc.. Tamarack develops, manufactures and distributes UV projection lithography systems as well as laser micro-structuring tools for the Advanced Packaging, 3D Integration, MEMS and LED markets. The company has sales offices in the semiconductor markets of Japan, Taiwan, China, Singapore and Korea.  Former CEOs  Frank P. Averdung and Dr. Per-Ove Hansson were hired from outside the group.

Gameplay In Predator, players control a squad of 3 Ghost special forces soldiers (from a selection of 8 possible characters from 5 different classes including scout, support gunner, marksman, shotgunner, and medic) to hunt terrorists in jungles and bases in Sri Lanka. The gameplay and user interface are heavily based on that of the Xbox 360 version of Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter and the console versions of Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2, being a third-person cover-based shooter with a focus on tactical squad orders. Unlike Ghost Recon 2 or Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter, the player is able to dynamically switch between control of all 3 of their Ghost squad mates, instead of only controlling a single main character. Plot After the crew of several U.S. mining vessels off the coast of Sri Lanka are massacred by unknown assailants, a team of Ghost special forces soldiers led by Colonel Scott Mitchell are covertly sent into Sri Lanka to deal with the situation. On the ground in Sri Lanka, the Ghosts are assisted by Mister Hisan and the Mumpuri Guard, a non-political group formed to protect the civilian population from various armed factions that are currently fighting for control of the country. The Ghosts receive intelligence from the C.I.A. identifying one of the armed groups, the People's Action Front (also known as the Activists) as being responsible for the massacre of the U.S. ship crews. The Ghosts take out several Activist bases and eventually assassinate their leader, \\"The Teacher\\". However, once the Teacher is dead, the Ghosts are ambushed by a much better equipped and more paramilitary-style faction known as the Loyalists. After being rescued by the Mumpuri Guard, the Ghosts engage in activities against the Loyalists, including rescuing Colonel Mitchell after his helicopter is shot down by them. The Ghosts eventually learn that the C.I.A.'s informant in Sri Lanka, Dilip Khan, is a member of the Loyalists and gave the U.S. false information implicating the Teacher in the attacks on U.S. ships. The attacks were actually conducted by the Loyalists as a false flag operation to trick the U.S. into assassinating the Teacher, so that the Activist faction could be absorbed into the Loyalist faction. The Ghosts capture Khan and force him to make a confession, causing the Activists and Loyalists to go to war with each other. Using the fighting as cover, the Ghosts infiltrate a Loyalist headquarters to rescue the President of Sri Lanka, who has been kidnapped by them. They also discover a Loyalist propaganda broadcast that reveals the leader of the Loyalists is Sunil Ranga, the Minister of Energy. The Ghosts infiltrate Ranga's mansion estate, where Ranga is killed while resisting capture, bringing an end to the hostilities. They are thanked by Mister Hisan for their actions, and inform him that \\"they were never here.\\" Reception The game was met with mixed reception upon release; GameRankings gave it a score of 56%, while Metacritic gave it 54 out of 100.

Since 1993, the organisation has reported that over 80,000 volunteers have planted 1,000,000 urban trees in parks, streets, woodlands, schools, hospitals and housing estates. The charity also runs the Edible Playgrounds programme, which aims to inspire school children to grow and eat healthy food. History Trees for Cities was founded in 1993 by a group of four friends: Jake Kempston, Belinda Winder, Jane Bruton and Julian Blake. For the first five or so years, the charity raised funds through its well-known parties. The charity was initially called Trees for LondonTrees for Cities: History and mission with the charitable objectives to \\"advance the education of the public in the appreciation of trees and their amenity value, and in furtherance of this the planting and protection of trees everywhere, and in particular inner city areas\\". In 2003, the charity changed its name to Trees for Cities to reflect a growth in activities in cities across the UK and across the globe. In 2009, Sharon Johnson replaced Graham Simmonds as Chief Executive. She was succeeded as Chief Executive by David J. Elliott in 2016.Who we are, Viridien Ltd The charity has a history of unusual office locations.

It also has offices in Ruskin Park, Lambeth, London. Function In addition to tree planting, the charity is involved in activities with schools and community groups and undertakes campaigning.  Urban Forests  Trees for Cities' work focuses on planting trees and greening community spaces where the social and environmental impact on local people is greatest. By engaging volunteers and planting up to 100,000 urban trees worldwide each year, the organisation is building resilience against threats facing the natural environment. Planting a range of tree species in urban areas have multiple impacts and benefits to people and the environment such as improving physical and mental wellbeing, absorbing air pollutants, sequestering carbon, masking noise, preventing flooding etc. The charity planted its millionth urban tree in 2019. It has recently played an active role in the campaign to stop the felling of Sheffield's street trees.  Edible Playgrounds  Edible Playgrounds transform areas in school grounds into vibrant outdoor spaces that excite and teach children about growing and eating healthy food. By instilling healthy eating habits at an early age, Edible Playgrounds can help to tackle obesity, food poverty and lack of access to nature head on, as well as providing a platform for fun and engaging lessons that support the school curriculum. Independent research among participating schools shows that 72% of schools said that children were more likely to choose fruits over less healthy snacks while 94% of schools said that pupils had improved attitudes towards healthy living. Trees for Cities has built 100 Edible Playgrounds, and aims to increase this number to 250 in 25 cities by 2022.  Planting Healthy Air in Schools  Planting Healthy Air in Schools has been developed to address London‚Äôs poor air quality and the detrimental health effects this has on people, especially children. London's trees remove 2,241 tons of pollution per year, making them a particularly effective barrier to the flow of toxic air. The charity is currently working in partnership with St Paul‚Äôs CE Primary, named the second most polluted school in London, to enrich the grounds through tree planting and greening in order to enhance the natural environment and promote the use of the outdoor space for pupils.  International  The charity works with local organisations and community groups around the world to focus their tree planting projects on delivering long-term, practical solutions to green polluted city environments and provide local people with the skills and ability to secure sustainable livelihoods.

The library is approximately 8,500 m¬≤. Old building Turku Main Library, old building The Turku Main Library 2,900 m¬≤ old building is a Dutch late Renaissance style building, constructed in 1903, built and delivered by Turku commercial counsellor Fredric von Rettig and designed by Karl August Wrede. The design was based on a Swedish House of Nobility in Stockholm.Kaupunginhallituksen puheenjohtaja Aleksi Randellin puhe The first floor was a national library for the working class and the second was the city library for academics. These two libraries merged in 1912 to become Turku City Library. This library at the time was the third in Finland. Before there was a library in Turku, the only places to get books from a building was in Helsinki and Rauma. New building Turku City Library expanded its operations and moved to a newly constructed building in 2007. The old building was renovated by architectural firm Arkkitehtitoimisto C&Co; Oy, and the new section and overall plan by JKMM Architects. The head designer was architect Asmo Jaaksi. There is approximately 5,400 m¬≤ of space in the new building. Turku Main Library currently occupies three buildings: the old and new buildings and a former office building for the governor built in 1818 which is now Caf√© Sirius . There is a walkway which connects the three buildings, going from old building past the caf√© to the new building. The reference, magazine and the children's and young adults sections are located in the new building. After renovation was complete in 2008, the fiction, art and music sections can be found in the old building. The principle of percent for art was taken into consideration during the construction of the new building. This means that a part of the construction expenses were set aside for art projects at the library. Five works of art were acquired for the library: Saara Ekstr√∂m's ornamental Alkukirjain (Initial Letter) spreads out on the walls of the main hall, and her video work Aakkoset (the Alphabet) can be seen at the Reading Corner of the hall. The sculpture Visual Vortex - Passage of Events by Hans-Christian Berg is situated in the showcase by the main entrance. Vestigia by Hilkka K√∂n√∂nen, inspired by abstract painting, is situated at the News Square. Hetkinen (Moment) by Ann Sundholm consists of gilded objects and a roof, and it shines its light on the main hall from the staff break room of the staff.

As a pair, one goat was sacrificed (not a scapegoat) and the living ‚Äúscapegoat‚Äù was released into the wilderness, taking with it all sins and impurities. The concept first appears in Leviticus, in which a goat is designated to be cast into the desert to carry away the sins of the community. Practices with some similarities to the scapegoat ritual also appear in Ancient Greece and Ebla. Etymology The word \\"scapegoat\\" is an English translation of the Hebrew ‚ÄòƒÉzƒÅz√™l (), which occurs in Leviticus 16:8: > ◊ï◊†◊™◊ü ◊ê◊î◊®◊ü ◊¢◊ú ◊©◊†◊ô ◊î◊©◊¢◊ô◊®◊ù ◊í◊®◊ú◊ï◊™ ◊í◊ï◊®◊ú ◊ê◊ó◊ì ◊ú◊ô◊î◊ï◊î ◊ï◊í◊ï◊®◊ú ◊ê◊ó◊ì ◊ú◊¢◊ñ◊ê◊ñ◊ú > And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for the Lord, and the > other lot for Azazel. (JPS) The Brown‚ÄìDriver‚ÄìBriggs Hebrew Lexiconp. 736. gives la-azazel () as a reduplicative intensive of the stem ‚Äò-Z-L \\"remove\\", hence la-‚ÄòƒÉzƒÅz√™l, \\"for entire removal\\". This reading is supported by the Greek Old Testament translation as \\"the sender away (of sins)\\". The lexicographer Gesenius takes azazel to mean \\"averter\\", which he theorized was the name of a deity, to be appeased with the sacrifice of the goat.Gesenius. \\"I have no doubt that it should be rendered 'averter'\\". Alternatively, broadly contemporary with the Septuagint, the pseudepigraphical Book of Enoch may preserve Azazel as the name of a fallen angel.Archie T. Wright The Origin of Evil Spirits: The Reception of Genesis 6.1‚Äì4 Page 111. 2005. \\"However, the corresponding Aramaic fragment of / Enoch 10.4 does not use the name Azazel; instead, the name has been reconstructed by Milik to read Asa'el. Stuckenbruck suggests the presence of the biblical form Azazel in the Ethiopic.Wright, David P. \\"Azazel\\". Pages 1:536‚Äì537 in Anchor Bible Dictionary. Edited by David Noel Freedman et al. New York: Doubleday, 1992.The Symbolism of the Azazel Goat. Ralph D. Levy. 1998. \\"This is still fairly straightforward, and is translated by the majority of the versions as \\"for Azazel\\" (Targums Onkelos and Pseudo-Jonathan follow this understanding, as do the RSV, NRSV, REB, and Tanakh). KJV and NKJV have \\"to be the scapegoat\\". Early English Christian Bible versions follow the translation of the Septuagint and Latin Vulgate, which interpret azazel as \\"the goat that departs\\" (Greek tragos apopompaios, \\"goat sent out\\", Latin , \\"emissary goat\\"). William Tyndale rendered the Latin as \\"(e)scape goat\\" in his 1530 Bible. This translation was followed by subsequent versions up through the King James Version of the Bible in 1611: \\"And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.\\" Several modern versions however either leave it as the proper noun Azazel, or footnote \\"for Azazel\\" as an alternative reading. Jewish sources in the Talmud (Yoma 6:4,67b) give the etymology of azazel as a compound of az, strong or rough, and el, mighty, that the goat was sent from the most rugged or strongest of mountains. From the Targums onwards the term azazel was also seen by some rabbinical commentators as the name of a Hebrew demon, angelic force, or pagan deity.The JPS guide to Jewish traditions. Page 224. Ronald L. Eisenberg, Jewish Publication Society ‚Äì 2004. \\"(Leviticus 16:8‚Äì10). In talmudic times, a popular rabbinic interpretation was that Azazel referred to the place to which the goat was sent, the eretz g'zera (inaccessible region) of Leviticus (16:22). Later, Azazel became associated with another...\\" The two readings are still disputed today.The JPS Torah Commentary: Leviticus Nahum M. Sarna, Chaim Potok, Jewish Publication Society ‚Äì 1989. \\"According to the first, Azazel is the name of the place in the wilderness to which the scapegoat was dispatched; ... According to the second line of interpretation, Azazel describes the goat. The word 'aza'zel is a contraction. Ancient Judaism The scapegoat was a goat that was designated () la-'aza'zeyl; \\"for absolute removal\\" (for symbolic removal of the people's sins with the literal removal of the goat), and outcast in the desert as part of the ceremonies of the Day of Atonement, that began during the Exodus with the original Tabernacle and continued through the times of the temples in Jerusalem. Once a year, on Yom Kippur, the Cohen Gadol sacrificed a bull as a sin offering to atone for sins he may have committed unintentionally throughout the year. Subsequently he took two goats and presented them at the door of the tabernacle. Two goats were chosen by lot: one to be \\"for YHWH\\", which was offered as a blood sacrifice, and the other to be the scapegoat to be sent away into the wilderness. The blood of the slain goat was taken into the Holy of Holies behind the sacred veil and sprinkled on the mercy seat, the lid of the ark of the covenant. Later in the ceremonies of the day, the High Priest confessed the intentional sins of the Israelites to God placing them figuratively on the head of the other goat, the Azazel scapegoat, who would symbolically \\"take them away\\".  Christian perspectives  Agnus-Dei: The Scapegoat (Agnus-Dei. Le bouc √©missaire), by James Tissot In Christianity, this process prefigures the sacrifice of Christ on the cross through which God has been propitiated and sins can be expiated. Jesus Christ is seen to have fulfilled all of the biblical \\"types\\"‚Äîthe High Priest who officiates at the ceremony, the Lord's goat that deals with the pollution of sin and the scapegoat that removes the \\"burden of sin\\". Christians believe that sinners who own their guilt and confess their sins, exercising faith and trust in the person and sacrifice of Jesus, are forgiven of their sins. Since the second goat was sent away to perish,The Golden Bough, p. 569. Sir James Frazer, Worsworth Reference. . the word \\"scapegoat\\" has developed to indicate a person who is blamed and punished for the sins of others.  Similar practices  Ancient Syria A concept superficially similar to the biblical scapegoat is attested in two ritual texts in archives at Ebla of the 24th century BC. They were connected with ritual purification on the occasion of the king's wedding. In them, a she-goat with a silver bracelet hung from her neck was driven forth into the wasteland of \\"Alini\\"; \\"we\\" in the report of the ritual involves the whole community. Such \\"elimination rites\\", in which an animal, without confession of sins, is the vehicle of evils (not sins) that are chased from the community are widely attested in the Ancient Near East.David P. Wright, The Disposal of the Impurity: Elimination Rites in the Bible and in Hittite and Mesopotamian Literature (Atlanta: Scholars Press) 1987:15-74. Ancient Greece Ancient Greeks practiced scapegoating rituals in exceptional times based on the belief that the repudiation of one or two individuals would save the whole community. Scapegoating was practiced with different rituals across ancient Greece for different reasons but was mainly used during extraordinary circumstances such as famine, drought, or plague. The scapegoat would usually be an individual of lower society such as a criminal, slave, or poor person and was referred to as the pharmakos, katharma or peripsima. There is a dichotomy, however, in the individuals used as scapegoats in mythical tales and the ones used in the actual rituals. In mythical tales, it was stressed that someone of high importance had to be sacrificed if the whole society were to benefit from the aversion of catastrophe (usually a king or the king's children). However, since no king or person of importance would be willing to sacrifice himself or his children, the scapegoat in actual rituals would be someone of lower society who would be given value through special treatment such as fine clothes and dining before the sacrificial ceremony. Sacrificial ceremonies varied across Greece depending on the festival and type of catastrophe. In Abdera, for example, a poor man was feasted and led around the walls of the city once before being chased out with stones. In Massilia, a poor man was feasted for a year and then cast out of the city in order to stop a plague. The scholia refer to the pharmakos being killed, but many scholars reject this and argue that the earliest evidence (the fragments of the iambic satirist Hipponax) show the pharmakos being only stoned, beaten, and driven from the community. In Literature J. M. Coetzee's work is permeated by the scapegoat problematic as well as the scapegoating practice in the social and psychological sense. Animals are connected to phenomena of scapegoating.https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1715344 The scapegoat, as a religious and ritualistic practice and a metaphor for social exclusion, is one of the major preoccupations in Dimitris Lyacos's Poena Damni trilogy.The Precarious Destitute: A Possible Commentary on the Lives of Unwanted Immigrants by Michael O'Sullivan.

Page 954. by Gerald Sanford, adapted by Matt Cimber, who also directed (credited on-screen as \\"Matteo Ottaviano\\"). The screenplay is by Michael Musto. Mansfield plays three different complex characters and over time many have considered this film to contain one of Mansfield's finest performances as she demonstrates her dramatic acting abilities, something she had longed to do throughout her career. The film also features an introduction by Walter Winchell who was a close friend of Mansfield's. Plot Pop, the janitor of a downtown New York City apartment building, is in the hall changing the lights. While there, he overhears an argument coming from within one of the apartments. The argument is between a young woman named Maria and her overbearing Italian mother, who is concerned that her daughter is bringing shame to the family name by associating with another tenant in the building named Eileen, who works as a prostitute. After storming out of the apartment, Maria encounters Pop in the hall and he begins to calm her down and the two eventually go into the building's kitchen to talk. Maria explains that the argument was about her friendship with Eileen, before then admitting her admiration for her friend's beauty and supposed exciting lifestyle. Pop then begins to tell Maria a story of a young woman named Johnnie, who used to live in the building with her husband Frankie about ten years earlier. The film flashes back to Frankie and Johnnie on their fire escape. It is evident that there is an emotional distance between the two, as Frankie seems unhappy with his life, leaving Johnnie, who is pregnant with their baby, to feel isolated. The two reminisce about how they first met, before Frankie mentions an old friend whom he had recently seen. This old friend was in the Navy, and was traveling all over the world. Frankie starts detailing his fascination for Navy life and the prospects it can bring to him, before Johnnie, realizing that Frankie desires to leave her for a better life, tries to change the subject. Pop then narrates that a few weeks later, Johnnie woke one morning to find that Frankie had left her and their unborn baby. Maria asks what happened to the baby, to which Pop informs her that Johnnie had a miscarriage. He also adds that Johnnie eventually changed her name to Mae and moved on with her life. However, she remained a tenant in the building. While discussing Mae, Pop mentions another couple who live in the building, Flo and Charley, who were involved with Mae at one point. The film then flashes back and shows the beginning of this couple's relationship. It is shown that Charley was friends with Mae, and she comes to his apartment one morning telling him that she is pregnant. Mae reveals to Charley that she plans on putting the baby up for adoption once it's born. Charley, feeling sorry for Mae, asks her to marry him. A few days later, Flo meets Charley in a bar where he explains this situation to her. Eventually, Charley realizes that he loves Flo and that he can't marry Mae just because he feels sorry for her. He then asks Flo to marry him. As Pop finishes narrating the story to Maria, Flo comes into the kitchen and is shown to be pregnant herself with Charley's baby. Maria and Flo begin talking about what became of Mae. Flo explains that while she and Charley got married, Mae had her baby and put it up for adoption like she said she would. Flo also elucidates that Mae, like she had done before, changed her name, this time to Eileen. Maria then realizes that her friend Eileen is the subject of the stories she has been told. Flo tells Maria about Eileen, who works as a prostitute at a nearby club. One night, she arrives to her apartment to find her lover Billy waiting for her. Billy is a sailor and is in love with Eileen, although she does not reciprocate this feeling. While she removes her makeup and undresses, Billy professes his desire to marry her, stating that he does not care about her past. She interjects by informing him of the many men she has been with and the things she has done with them, before then reflecting of a time when she was in love with a man whom she planned to marry. However, he was killed in an accident shortly before their wedding. Billy still expresses his wish to marry her and while doing so, accidentally breaks a porcelain doll given to her by the man she once loved. Eileen then becomes hostile towards Billy, and begins mocking him, telling him she would never marry him and that she would never love him. Billy incidentally brandishes a gun and points it at Eileen, to which she tells him to go ahead and shoot. Billy, not being able to shoot her, walks out of the room and ultimately kills himself. Eileen, at first in a state of shock, sits down at her mirror and begins re-applying her makeup, implying that she will again move on with her continuously troubled life. Cast *Jayne Mansfield as Johnnie/Mae/Eileen *Dorothy Keller as Flo *Fabian Dean as Charley *Billy M. Greene as Pop *Terri Messina as Maria *Martin Horsey as Frankie *Walter Gregg as Billy *Velia Del Greco as Maria's mother Production The feature was Jayne Mansfield's final \\"filmed\\" starring role. The feature was shot in 1966, while Mansfield was married to her third (and final) husband, Matt Cimber. The movie was briefly released in the mid months of 1966, but was quickly pulled from theaters. The feature was released \\"legally\\" and \\"officially\\" in 1968; which was nearly a year after Mansfield's tragic death in a car crash at the age of 34. After filming Single Room Furnished in 1966, Mansfield filmed only character acting roles in films. Her legally final film appearance was in 1967's A Guide for the Married Man playing an uncredited cameo role. Today Single Room Furnished is considered by Jayne Mansfield fans as one of her finest acting performances; some of her other dramatic performances were in Illegal, The Burglar, The Wayward Bus, all three Hollywood productions; and, two independent foreign films: Too Hot to Handle and The Challenge.

Following the death of President Omar Bongo, opposition leader Pierre Mamboundou denounced an alleged coup plot on 23 June 2009. Mapangou responded to Mamboundou by denying the existence of coup plot and saying that Mamboundou had not given any information he might have on such a plot to the authorities. Mapangou nevertheless stressed that the army was \\"alert\\".\\"Gabon : Mamboundou crie ¬´au loup !¬ª\\" , AFP (Gaboneco), 24 June 2009 . After Ali Bongo received the nomination of the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG) as its candidate for the August 2009 presidential election, Mapangou worked on Bongo's campaign. Bongo won the election, according to official results, and it was anticipated that Mapangou would be one of his top associates as President. Taking office on 16 October 2009, he appointed Fran√ßois Engongah Owono as Secretary-General of the Presidency and Mapangou as Deputy Secretary-General of the Presidency on the same day; Mapangou was also assigned the role of Spokesman of the Presidency. In the press, Mapangou's appointment at the Presidency was interpreted in light of two factors: Mapangou was already a close associate of Bongo because he had worked under Bongo at the Ministry of Defense, and Mapangou was native to the area of Fougamou in Ngouni√© Province--therefore his appointment could potentially draw local support away from opposition leader Louis-Gaston Mayila, who was also native to that area.

Life Probably a native of Gloucester, he first appears as a lay preacher among the Independents there; in 1648 he described himself as a preacher of the gospel, formerly in and near Gloucester. He was acquainted with the Greek text of the New Testament and with Latin commentators, and his antitrinitarian sentiments were the result of his own scriptural studies. He mentioned meeting John Biddle, who left Gloucester in 1646, but he did not adopt Biddle's specific opinions, his doctrine being of the Arian, not the Socinian type. He expressly states in 1668 that he had not read any of the writings of F. P. Socinus. By the parliamentary committee at Gloucester he was examined (1646?) on suspicion of unsoundness in the article of the Trinity, and gave a written statement in which he owns to having ‚Äòhad some questionings,‚Äô but gives his reasons for being now satisfied of ‚Äòthe Godhead of the Holy Ghost.‚Äô He seems to have left Gloucester for London, where he lodged with Edward Atkinson, an antitrinitarian, in Aldersgate Street. Joining the parliamentary army, he belonged in 1648, according to his own account, to the lifeguard of Sir Thomas Fairfax. He still continued to preach, publishing a defence of ‚Äòa private man's preaching.‚Äô Early in 1650 he became public preacher to the garrison at Chester, in succession to Samuel Eaton. The biographer of John Murcot, writing in 1657, speaks of Knowles as having been ‚Äòa formidable and blazing comet at Chester,‚Äô where ‚Äòin public sermons, private conferences, and by a manuscript‚Äô he ‚Äòdenied Jesus Christ to be the Most High God.‚Äô A short paper of arguments for the deity of Christ, sent by Eaton to Chester from Dukinfield, was published by Knowles in 1650, with his own reply. The pamphlet purports to have been ‚Äòprinted by T. N.‚Äô for Gyles Calvert, the publisher of unorthodox theology; and in July 1650 John Whittell, girdler, of Milk Street, London, was brought before the council of state on the charge of having caused it to be printed. Replies were published by Eaton (1650 and 1651), and by Thomas Porter of Whitchurch, Shropshire (1651). The imprimatur of Porter's pamphlet, entitled ‚ÄòA Serious Exercitation,‚Äô is dated 26 December 1650, and by that time Knowles was ‚Äòlate preacher at Chester.‚Äô He appears to have returned to Gloucester, for on 19 November 1650 the mayor of that city was directed by the council of state to examine witnesses on oath respecting Knowles's preaching against the divinity of Christ. He moved to Pershore, Worcestershire, where he lived some fifteen years as ‚Äòa professed minister.‚Äô At Pershore he was apprehended on 9 April 1665 by Thomas Windsor Hickman, 7th Baron Windsor, and imprisoned first at Worcester, and then in the Gatehouse Prison, Westminster, on 23 May. Papers found in his house were made the basis of charges of heresy; he had been invited on 5 June 1662 by H. Hed of Huntingdon to meet Christopher Crell, the exiled Polish antitrinitarian, at Oxford; on 19 November 1664 he had been invited to London by Thomas Firmin. Letters from his friends were construed as implying that he was ready to countenance sedition. A collection on behalf of the Polish exiles was thought to be really for English rebels. On 23 June and again on 7 July he petitioned (writing also to George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle) for liberty to go out on bail, as the plague was then raging in London. His petition was repeated on 2 February 1666, and he gained his liberty soon afterwards. On his release he mixed in controversial talk with London clergy, who respected his learning and sincerity. With his publication in reply to Justification onely upon a Satisfaction (1668) by Robert Ferguson he drops out of notice. A pamphleteer of 1698 states that he bequeathed books to a library at Gloucester. Works He published: * ‚ÄòA Modest Plea for Private Men's Preaching,‚Äô &c.;, 1648, (published 30 March; in answer to ‚ÄòPrivate Men no Pulpit Men,‚Äô &c.;, 1646, by Giles Workman). * ‚ÄòA Friendly Debate ‚Ä¶ by Writing betwixt Mr. Samuel Eaton and Mr. John Knowles,‚Äô &c.;, 1650. * ‚ÄòAn Answer to Mr. Ferguson's Book,‚Äô &c.; [1668?].

At present, it is only a nominally an S-Bahn in that it only operates on the lines of the Austrian Federal Railways. Expansion projects, including new stations, however, are being planned.  Current lines  Six lines have been operating since the timetable change on 13 December 2009.  and \\"Inntal (Inn valley) S-Bahn\\"  Line S1 runs along the Inn valley on the Arlberg- and the Lower Inn Valley railway between √ñtztal and Kufstein at 60-minute intervals.

Line S2 runs between Telfs-Pfaffenhofen and Fritzens-Wattens, with the combined service providing a 30-minute frequency.  and \\"Wipptal-S-Bahn\\"  Line S3 runs from Hall in Tirol on the lower Inn to Steinach am Brenner (station named Steinach in Tirol) and Brenner lines through the Wipptal (Wipp valley) south of Innsbruck. Line S4 runs between Brenner and Innsbruck central station or V√∂ls with some continuing to Fritzens-Wattens instead. Services operate at 60-minute frequencies, so the combined service between Innsbruck and Steinach operates at 30-minute intervals, and between Innsbruck and Hall trains operating as S1, S2, S3, REX (regional express), provide a service every 15-minute during the day.   Since the timetable change on 13 December 2009 S5 replaced the existing Mittenwald railway regional services to Seefeld and Scharnitz, operating at 60-minute intervals. In addition services to Garmisch- Partenkirchen and Munich in Germany now operates as REX, usual at a 120-minute frequency.   Also since 13 December 2009 regional trains on the Salzburg-Tirol line between Hochfilzen and W√∂rgl are replaced by an S6 service. This is currently operated by a single train between Saalfelden,W√∂rgl, Innsbruck and Brenner.  Regional express services  The S-Bahn run on lines also used by REX trains. These generally operate at 120-minute intervals, except for trains towards Salzburg. Additional REX trains arrive operate in the peak hours. History The first S-Bahn line commenced operation on 9 December 2007 between 6am and 10pm at 30-minute intervals along the Inn valley lines (Lower Inn Valley and Arlberg railways )with stops at Hall in Tirol, Rum, Innsbruck central station, Innsbruck West station, Vols, Kematen in Tirol, Zirl, Inzing, Hatting, Flaurling, Oberhofen im Inntal and Telfs-Pfaffenhofen.

Founded in 2003, Boom Pam took its name from Aris San's song of the same name, and plays a mixture of Mediterranean, Balkan, Greek, rock and surf music in a format of a quartet consisting of electric guitar, tuba, keyboard and drums. They have been playing in a variety of venues, from small clubs to large concert halls. Boom Pam served as the opening act for the reunion show of the well-known Israeli indie rock band \\"Minimal Compact\\", as well as Emir Kusturica's No Smoking Orchestra. That, along with a showcase at WOMEX 2006, launched their worldwide touring career.  Background  The original format of the band as a trio started at the high-school period in Telma Yellin High School of the Arts of three members: Uri Kinrot, Uzi Feinerman and Yuval Zolotov. The three haven't stop playing during and after school and played with the idea of forming a band together which will combine the influences of all members: Yuval used to play in a classic orchestra whereas Uri and Uzi played in Rock and Jazz band. Long time after graduating from school, Uzi and Uri shared an apartment together in south Tel Aviv. The area, which is well known by its mixed cultures and is a meeting point for all kinds of music genres especially Arabic and Greek Music, influenced the two to combine elements from their Jazz and Rock bases with these genres specific. They started to explore this idea by jamming meetings along with Yuval on the Tuba. In 2002, the band was formed as a trio with Kinrot and Feinerman on the electric guitars and Zolotov on the tuba and the Bass Drum. The name of the band was given by Kinrot as a tribute to Aris San's big hit - \\"Boom Pam\\".  Band Highlights  Boom Pam's debut album was recorded in Frankfurt for the German label \\"Essay Recordings\\". The band co-produced the album with DJ Shantel. This LP was released during the Spring of 2006 and is distributed worldwide. The album went straight into the top ten list of the European World Music charts. Their second album, \\"Puerto Rican Nights\\", was released in 2008. Their debut show in North America was at the GlobalFest 2007. Afterwards they toured throughout the USA and Canada, opening for The Ventures in California and playing at the Winnipeg Folk Festival and the Montreal International Jazz Festival. Boom Pam's third album was recorded in late 2009 and was released in 2010 by the Tel Aviv-based label \\"Audio Montage\\". Following the album release, they made promotional appearances at SXSW and various venues in Europe. Boom Pam have also been actively involved in various projects. They worked with the Batsheva Dance Company, released several Israeli hit singles, recorded film music, collaborated with Balkan Beat Box and Kutiman, and played a concert with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2014 year Boom Pam also participated in the music project - ‚ÄúBoiler Room‚Äù which occurred in Tel Aviv. In spring 2015 Boom Pam was chosen to play in the annual music festival Lollapalooza in Buenos Aires, Argentina along with the artists Pharrell Williams, Jack White, The Smashing Pumpkins, Foster the People, Alt-J, Cypress Hill and many more.  Boom Pam and Selda Baƒücan  In 2013 Boom Pam collaborated with the legendary Turkish artist Selda Baƒücan. The band visited Istanbul for a series of rehearsals which eventually led to a special show in front of 10000 people in ‚ÄúGroove Festival‚Äù. The collaboration between two artists was based upon mutual music and political situation of both projects. Boom Pam was inspired by the psychedelic Middle Eastern sounds of the revolutionary 1970s Turkish singer and songwriter especially by the unique and powerful music and politically fueled lyrics. Boom Pam sought out their mentor, boarding a plane to Turkey for a collaboration of extraordinary proportions. The common middle eastern roots between Selda and Boom Pam was the seed that allowed for an exceptional musical relationship to flourish. The generational gap between the young quartet and the Turkish legend was bridged out their natural and instant connection through the power of music.  Boom Pam in Japan  In 2012 Boom Pam arrived in Japan for the first time as part of the 60th Anniversary of diplomatic relations between Japan and Israel for a series of live shows in Tokyo. After receiving great reviews among the Japanese audience, the band returned to Japan two years later in 2014 for a big tour in Tokyo and several other cities, including a special performance at the famous Fuji-Rock music festival. In summer 2015, Boom Pam returned to Japan for the third time. This time, in addition to the band's well known repertoire, Boom Pam collaborated with the Shibuya-Kei Japanese singer Mayumi Kojima. Together they toured around Japan and recorded an album that was released in the same year.

COMTRADE files are typically generated by Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), such as an electronic protective relay, in electrical substations during power systems disturbances. These IEDs are monitoring the electrical characteristics of the power system by digitally sampling measurements of the current, voltage, power, frequency, etc. at a high speed. The IEDs then use digital signal processing algorithms on that data to detect abnormal conditions in the power system so that automated control actions can be taken to prevent damage to the power system. When faults are detected, the IEDs will record the digitized transient fault data that was used during processing into a file using the COMTRADE file format. Analysis tools can then download the COMTRADE file and calculate useful information related to the disturbance. For instance, a COMTRADE recording of the fault current absorbed by a transformer prior to the circuit breaker opening can be used to calculate the total energy dissipated by the transformer which helps the utility to more accurately estimate the impact of that fault on the lifetime of the transformer. COMTRADE files from multiple substations can be used collectively to perform forensic analysis of large scale power disturbance events (e.g. blackouts) to determine the root cause of the disturbance, help improve system protection and guide future mitigation strategies. The COMTRADE file format has been standardized by the Power System Relaying & Controls Committee (PSRC) of the IEEE Power & Energy Society as C37.111. The most widely used version of the COMTRADE standard is C37.111-1999, but the latest version is C37.111-2014. The 1999 version of the COMTRADE standard specifies a file format that consists of multiple file types designated by the assigned file extensions of *.CFG, *.INF, *.HDR, and *.DAT. The *.DAT file contains the digitized sample data in an ASCII text format. The *.CFG file contains configuration data on what is in the *.DAT file including information such as signal names, start time of the samples, number of samples, min/max values, and more. Only the *.CFG and *.DAT files were mandatory. Although the values of the digitized samples in the *.DAT file are viewable without the *.CFG file, the value of the data is greatly diminished as it would be very difficult to fully reconstruct the meaning of the data without the *.CFG file. As applications for using COMTRADE grew the limitations of the file format began to cause problems. For instance, the North American SynchroPhasor Initiative (NASPI) sponsored by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) wanted to use the COMTRADE file format to exchange synchrophasor data. The C37.111-1999 version of the COMTRADE configuration (*CFG) files specified ASCII encoding only, supported limited analog and digital status data types, and did not convey any power system configuration information. This would have made large scale exchange of synchrophasor data more difficult. Beginning in 2011, the IEEE PSRC began work on a new version of the COMTRADE standard that has been published as C37.111-2013. Also known as IEC 60255-24 Ed.2, this standard defines a format for files containing transient waveform and event data collected from power systems or power system models. The format is intended to provide an easy-to- interpret form for use in exchanging data. The standard is for files stored on currently used physical media such as portable external hard drives, USB drives, CD, or DVD. The COMTRADE standard itself does not specify how to transfer data files over communication networks. The 2014 version of the COMTRADE standard supports a variety of new features including XML encoding configuration and data, a single file type (*.CFF) that combines all the C37.111-1999 types into a single file, additional data types for 32 bit binary and floating point values and a partial binary encoding to reduce file size. The IEEE Power Quality Subcommitteehttps://site.ieee.org/pes-pq/ of the IEEE Power & Energy Society has also specified a file format called Power Quality Data Interchange Format (PQDIF) in IEEE Std.1159.3-2019https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1159_3-2019.html that is similar to COMTRADE in structure but is used primarily to convey power quality data instead of transient disturbance data. Like IEEE COMTRADE, IEEE PQDIF can be used to exchange waveform measurements and phasor measurements. However, IEEE PQDIF allows storage of data logs, magnitude-duration measurements, histograms, and more. There are numerous COMTRADE viewers and analysis software available from many commercial companies as well as: * free viewers like PQDiffractor, TOP, GTPPLOT * free analysis software like Comcalc Pro (includes multi-file viewing capabilities). Viewer/analysis functionality varies. Some free COMTRADE viewers and analysis software also includes additional advanced functionality (e.g. protection relay behavior analysis (line/transformer differential/impedance protection, fault/harmonic analysis, user-defined mathematical expressions, analysis and plots, COMTRADE file editing and creation etc).

It usually involves kayakers descending snow slopes, in contrast to river sports such as whitewater kayaking for which the boats were usually designed. Snow boating is typically done in the backcountry and occasionally at resorts and ski areas. Races are held in a modus similar to those of snowboarding they are known as a boatercross. In the races, kayakers race to a finish line or point. Powder and backcountry snow boating have steadily increased in popularity and many videos can be found online, reflecting the increase in the sport's popularity. Typically either playboats or creek-boats are used depending on the style of snowboating to be done. Although PFDs are not worn, helmets, and paddles are often used.  History  This sport has been officially around since the year 2002 where the first race was held in Lienz, Austria by a local group of kayakers. In the year 2007 a so-called 'world championship' was held in Lienz where Peter Draxl from Austria was the first champion.announcement for the second world championships Rene Feuerstein (Austria) followed him in the year 2008 as the second world champion. In Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir its first demonstration was given by J&K; Ski & Mountaineering Association at Sonamarg in 2014. But after lapse of 3 years the Winter Games Association of J&K; organised a 10-day course for 10 local boys at famous ski resort of the Himalayas Gulmarg. The former Kashmir University Aquatics and Adventure Sports Coach Muhammad Yusuf imparted training to the youth. The camp was held from 18 to 29 February 2017. The J&K; State Cable Car Corporation sponsored the program, while the kayaks were provided by the Tourism Department of the state. The camp received wide coverage in the social, electronic and print media. please watch a video clip here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIkaKGN1rJ4  Kayaks used for Snow Boating  Athletes typically prefer Creek Boats or Play Boats when snow boating. The type of boat is the athletes choice depending on the type of slope the athlete plans to snow boat down and which boat they feel more comfortable with. Creek Boats are traditionally used for hobbies like bird hunting, fishing, and other hobbies that require the environment to stay as calm as possible. Creek Boats are longer than Play Boats and considered to be high-volume with the volume being most concentrated around the cockpit. The Creek Boat is designed to resurface quickly if by chance either end is to submerge. Most Creek Boats have ample rocker which allows for quick turns, and dull ends to prevent vertical pins, they have slight edges along the bottom called \\"chines\\" to give good carving control on turns. There are many types of Play Boats, which were originally designed to move downstream quickly, tackle challenging whitewater, and provide a stable ride. Play Boats have traditionally been used for surfing waves and performing tricks. Unlike Creek Boats, Play Boats have a lot less volume and squashed decks so the ends can easily sink under water. Most Play Boats have a planing hull which is very flat and allows the boat to plane on water or snow when it reaches a certain speed and the chines creating carving control as well as drag for slowing down when necessary. Athletes use wax or Rain-X on the bottom of their boat allowing them to maximize their speed.  Equipment  Athletes should choose a kayak that they feel most comfortable with, along with a two bladed paddle to help them control their balance, turns, curves, and swerves. When snow boating it is important to wear equipment that protects an individual from the cold winds and possible water spray. Windproof, waterproof clothes are recommended, most designs are often made of neoprene jersey mix which allows freedom for movement but still keeps a snug fit. Helmets are very important in case the athlete loses control of the boat and spins off course, or flips. Eye gear to shield the eyes from snow, wind, and water is optional.  Competitions  The first race was held in Lienz, Austria by a local group of kayakers. Snow boating is considered an extreme sport, so most Ski Resorts do not allow it. If an athlete wants to practice snow boating they typically do it in the backcountry with the exception of a few ski resorts and ski areas, otherwise there are snow races where athletes race to a finish line or point. This sport has steadily gained popularity around the world which causes these races to continue. The majority of participants in these races are skilled whitewater kayakers who have professional grade equipment. Races are typically conducted in a form similar to other winter direct racing sports where four racers compete in each round and the two winners in each round move on to the next round. Many slopes include a series of obstacles such as the Monarch Mountain's 20-foot banked turns, leading into a 50-foot-long halfpipe, and ending in a pool of icy snow melt pumped in from a nearby creek.

He came to Kulathuvayal in 1951 when the region was an underdeveloped hill area with no roads, schools or churches. Most Christians in Malabar are migrants. Migration began during the economic Depression of the 1930s and continued for decades. He started the first school in Kulathuvayal in 1954 and encouraged other parishes in the diocese to open schools before building churches. In 1976, Monsignor Varkey started the Malabar region's first charismatic retreat center, it currently attracts thousands of people. Pope Benedict XVI gave the priest the honorary title of monsignor in 2007 in recognition of his service to the Church. He died on 24 June 2009, at the age of 88.

O'Sullivan played in the Scottish Football League for both Clydebank and Brechin City during 2000, but then suffered a serious knee injury. As he was battling to recover from that injury, O'Sullivan was found dead in a friend's house in Haddington. It was suspected that a drugs overdose, including methadone and ecstasy, was the cause of death.

In Russian Warheroes.ru. Retrieved on 17 December 2015. Early life and career Born on 20 August (or 2 September) in 1914 in the town of Gori, Georgia, Nadiradze was raised in a teacher's family in Tbilisi. Initially working as an assistant in a small Georgian aerospace faculty, he made his first invention in Mai 1934.Melua, A. I. (2005) –ù–ê–î–ò–†–ê–î–ó–ï –ê–õ–ï–ö–°–ê–ù–î–† –î–ê–í–ò–î–û–í–ò–ß. rtc.ru After finishing at the Transcaucasian Industrial Institute in 1936 he moved to Moscow and applied to the Moscow Aviation Institute. Two years later Nadiradze began working in the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) in which he led a team of engineers engaged in theoretical and experimental research on aircraft landing gears based on the principles of air cushions. He was also involved in the development of the Tupolev Tu-2 and early Soviet turbojet fighters. In 1941 he was appointed as a chief designer in the Moscow OKB (Experimental Design Bureau) plant 22 (Gorbunov). Missile technology At the end of 1941 Nadiradze began to research rocketry. During the Great Patriotic War he developed five versions of anti-tank shells, one of which had satisfactory results. In 1945 he got appointed chief designer and chief of the bureau of the Faculty of Missile weapons Moscow Mechanical Institute of the People's Commissariat of ammunition, functioning as experienced OKB guide holding lectures on the production and designing of missiles and launchers, while simultaneously conducting research on two-stage rockets and turbojets. In 1948 the Council of Ministers of the USSR transferred the Moscow OKB institute to CB-2 Minelhozmasha and Nadiradze took command over a division which was developing unguided anti-aircraft missiles and anti-tank rockets. In 1950 he developed the Soviet anti-air missile system \\"Swift\\" and a year later the new KB-2 was incorporated into GSNII MSKHM-642, which basically merged diverse design bureaus working on cruise missiles, powder and radio-controlled bombs into one institute. In 1953 Nadiradze then took charge over project \\"Raven\\". His experience was used to create the world's first high altitude meteorological rocket which' development technically already began in 1949 at the Central Aerological Observatory Hydrometeorological Service of the USSR. The rocket was designed to deliver \\"instruments\\" into the upper atmosphere. His involvement was of high importance since the first Soviet meteorological rocket MR-1 Meteo which was successfully launched in 1951 was developed by Alexander Nadiradze himself. On 15 October the same year he would be tasked with the development of the so-called \\"Tshaika\\" radio-controlled bombs (UB-2000F). Tests were successfully completed in 1955 and the new weapon was accepted for service later that year. In late 1957 Moscow GSNII MSKHM-642 was combined with Reutov OKB-52 Chelomey. Nadiradze got appointed head of Chelomey's secret development section and in 1961 took charge over the entire OKB while remaining chief designer. By decision of the Soviet government and defense ministry a competition on designing a mobile intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) was organized and Alexander Nadiradze's team won. He became founder of the Soviet mobile missile forces. On 6 March 1966 the defence ministry gave order for the development of mobile solid fuel ICBMs. The project was named \\"Temp-20\\" which would then become the RT-21 Temp 2S. On 14 March 1972 \\"Air-20\\" was launched for tests at the state landfill RVSN (Plesetsk Cosmodrome) in the Arkhangelsk region which were completed in December 1974. The secret launch site was headed by fellow Georgian Lt.General Galaktion Alpaidze who was in charge of the Soviet missile program and from 1975 also deputy director of the Moscow Institute for Thermal Technology. On 21 February 1976 two missile regiments consisting of Temp-20s started their combat duty in Plesetsk. RSD-10 missile and its transporter erector launcher Prior to that Nadiradze had already created the RSD-10 Pioneer in 1971 which was based on his earlier works on the Temp-2S. Its flight tests went exceptionally well and ended on 9 January 1976. The mobile missile complex Pioneer then got accepted for service on 11 March the same year. His Pioneer would become the base for the later Topol missile. Nadiradze's third great achievement in Soviet missile technology was complete for which he got awarded with the title Hero of Socialist Labour (Gold medal hammer and sickle) and Order of Lenin. He then developed the heavily improved Pioneer-UTTH (NATO designation SS-20 Mod 2) which would deliver warheads with three 5‚Äì50 kt MIRVs.Intermediate-range ballistic missile RSD-10 Pioner. blogspot.de (15 October 2013) The new system was adopted by the Strategic Missile Forces on 28 April 1981. On 29 December 1981 Nadiradze was elected full member (academician) of the USSR Academy of Science in the Department of Mechanics and Control Processes (theoretical and applied mechanics, mechanical engineering and engineering science). At the Kazomi Presidium Supreme Soviet of the USSR he was awarded Hero of Socialist Labour a second and Order of Lenin a fourth time. When General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. President Reagan signed a treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range to Short-Range missiles on 8 December 1987 the USSR had to destroy more than 728 of its Pioneer missile complexes. The RT-2PM Topol which' development was already approved in 1977 but put into active service not earlier than 1988 just a year after Nadiradze's death, remains one of the primary strike capabilities of the Russian Federation. The main problem of the Topol was to create a suitable battle management system, what kept Nadiradze occupied throughout the entire development stage. For his last project, Nadiradze received the USSR State Prize in 1987. His work was continued by another scientist named Boris N. Lapygin.Topol. Astronautix.com.

This last achievement kept the progressive concept of mobile ICBMs alive, yet was less decisive than his very first inventions. However, as the author of 100 scientific magazines and over 220 inventions and guides Nadiradze's work would prove to remain vital for future developments and projects based on his earlier achievements. He principally established a scientific base for missile systems which would be used by his disciples and successors.–ë–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—è –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –ù–∞–¥–∏—Ä–∞–¥–∑–µ.

The game was developed under the leadership of Stewart Butterfield. Glitch was officially launched on September 27, 2011, but reverted to beta status on November 30, 2011, citing accessibility and depth issues. Glitch was officially shut down on December 9, 2012.  Gameplay  Glitch was a casual, 2D browser-based game featuring a strong multiplayer component. It deliberately steered away from combat mechanics, instead focusing on collaborative crafting and gathering activities. Players were prompted to complete quests and perform various activities that would change the persistent world. Players were invited to expand upon the world, shaping its growth through various activities such as growing plants and trees and cooking food items. The game was free to play, but players could spend money to acquire a number of things such as customization options for their avatar. Upon logging in for the first time, a user was brought to a one-time street (area), in which a staff member, or specially appointed user (called a \\"greeter\\"), would briefly explain the game and show them some features. Once left, the greeting street could never be re-entered. After the \\"unlaunch\\" they had a new, more complex and full introduction, in which it was done by NPCs. The game also had \\"groups\\". Groups were tabs in-game (along with individual user IM tabs) that functioned quite like modern chat rooms. The players could create their own groups, join another person's group, or go on either one of the two default groups, one of which was \\"Live Help\\", in which users could help one another with general gameplay, the chiefer authority (excluding staff members) here was a \\"Helper\\", separate from a staff member, as helpers were mature and professional players appointed by staff members, whereas staff members had contracts and worked for Tiny Speck, the other default chat was \\"Global Chat\\", this was for general discussion of any appropriate/popular topic. Eventually, Tiny Speck introduced \\"Guides\\", which were players specially appointed by the staff to help others learn the game in a special, introductory area. If a player was being disruptive, disrespectful, rude, flooding, or cursing constantly, the player character could be taken to a black room with a single, low light lamp. The user would be accompanied by one or many staff members trying to calm them down and if that did not work, the avatar could be locked down to a chair and the player booted off for an amount of time, called a \\"Time-Out\\".  History   Development  Glitch's lead designer and Tiny Speck co-founder Stewart Butterfield began conceiving the game that would later become Glitch as early as 2002. But because of difficult financial circumstances at the time, he and his colleagues at Ludicorp instead focused on a side-project which later became Flickr. In 2009, Butterfield founded Tiny Speck with the aim of creating a social game. Glitch has been confirmed to be created on February 21, 2009 (first day of official gameplay). However, the earliest date on the Glitch calendar is either April 1, 2009 or May 22, 2009, which therefore presumes that the game was created before the calendar was implemented. The game was also played on the company's website (tinyspeck.com) before being transferred to glitch.com. Glitch was announced in July 2009. All traces of gameplay history have gone as far back as July 2, 2009. In February 2011, the game went from closed alpha to beta.  Release  Glitch was officially launched on September 27, 2011. But two months later, on November 30, 2011, Glitch \\"unlaunched\\", reverting to beta status. The developers cited issues of accessibility for new players, and depth of gameplay for experienced players. Glitch had test sessions that ran for usually about a week to a month, in which bugs were recorded, and then for a week or two, revisions were made improving the game, based on player bug reports, staff found bugs/errors, and/or source code updates. At the end of each one, Glitch would throw a massive party, called an End of the World Party, a.k.a. EOTW, EOW, in which a large majority of the players would gather in a suggested area and party, several items were dropped and people even decorated with the items. At the last 60 seconds, the staff members, on an account called \\"GOD\\", would speak so everyone in the whole world (also known as \\"Ur\\"), even those not at the party, would see him speak, his text would also be shown in the game windows itself, and a song would play called Good Night Groddle, made by Lelu, and improved by Daniel Simmons, Glitch's musical editor, replacing trumpets that sounded the original ending. The last message of the game was GOD saying \\"*poof*\\".  Closure and fan relaunches  Glitch was permanently closed in December 2012, due to limited audience appeal. The company received praise for providing players with continued access to certain game resources and for caring for its laid-off staffers. One year after the game's closure, some of its source code and Flash sources were released to the public under the Creative Commons Zero license. An attempt was made to revive Glitch as a fan-made fork named \\"Children of Ur\\" which aimed to keep the charm of the original game while adding a few twists.childrenofur.com The project is hosted under MIT license on GitHub where Glitch's original ActionScript was ported to Dart.ChildrenOfUr on github.com At 2020 the game remains pre-alpha, but most of the textures and basic fundamentals were implemented. On December 9, 2014, another fan project to relaunch Glitch under the name Eleven began alpha testing. An alpha tester described Eleven as \\"identical to Glitch\\". A 2014 video released by the developers of Eleven demonstrates many of the gameplay features functioning as they originally did in Glitch. The \\"Eleven Giants\\" source code repository is hosted on GitHub under the MIT license.License on github.com/ElevenGiants In January 2019, another Glitch remake was launched under the name of \\"Odd Giants\\". It was closed source, developed by a small team and at 2020 has attracted six supporters via Patreon. Reception Glitch was well received by The A.V. Club, who gave the game a B+ and commended its open-ended approach and variety of tasks. Ars Technica found the game fun, filled with funny little touches. Joystiq's Beau Hindman named Glitch \\"Most Charming\\" in his 2011 Frindie Awards (selected from free-to-play, indie, browser-based games).

Broadcast from studios at Albert Quay in Leith, the station was billed as radio for Scotland's thinking classes but was unable to create a clear identity for itself, while changing its format to focus on more populist content, including less speech and more music. The station was relaunched as Real Radio Scotland in January 2002 following a buyout by GMG Radio. Real Radio has since been succeeded by Heart Scotland. History Origins In early 1993, the Radio Authority invited applicants to bid for a new regional FM licence covering Central Scotland and serving a potential audience of 3.3 million listeners. Seven groups contested the franchise: *Central Scotland Radio, a speech-based station backed by Border and Grampian television companies *Radio Six, led by Tony Currie with a 24-hour news and speech station *Central Scotland Broadcasting Ltd with an easy listening and information service *A company with Celtic/rock *A company with contemporary rock *A company with country music *A company with Christian-based programming Central Scotland Radio was named as the preferred bidder on 10 December 1993. The Radio Authority argued that the station would extend listeners choice and could demonstrate financial stability and professional qualifications appropriate to launching and maintaining the service during its eight-year licence period. The company's founding chairman, Sir David Steel (a non- executive director of Border Television), pledged the majority of its programming would be a unique Scottish view of Britain, the world, and Central Scotland's place in it. We will be primarily a talk station with news, travel information, and weather reports. Sport, politics, and the arts will be covered and listeners will be heavily involved through regular phone-ins. There was some disagreement and even questioning of the decision to let two television companies already running regional ITV franchises operate the new licence.  1994 - 1996  Scot FM began broadcasting on Friday 16 September 1994, after two weeks of test transmissions. Problems arose even before the station went on air - none of the thirteen presenters listed in its original application schedule had remained with the company and its target of 50% quality speech output at peak times could not be achieved. The station's news service was contracted out to Reuters Radio, leading to some confusion over how a station promising a unique Scottish view of Britain was carrying most of its news bulletins from an agency producing syndicated bulletins in London. . Complaints about the station began to appear in the press. Meanwhile, Scot FM management went back to the Radio Authority four times to seek permission to reduce its speech obligations within the licensed format. The station itself had limited music resources with around 1000 tracks on its playout systems, leading to some members of staff reportedly visiting local music shops to buy CDs of artists who were appearing as guests on the station. . The first official RAJAR figures released in early 1995 revealed that the station had a weekly audience of 8%, far short of the target 13% share, making it one of the least successful UK radio stations in terms of audience share. Within seven months of the station going on air, five different presenters had hosted Scot FM's breakfast show and a programme controller had left owing to ill health. A major revamp of the station took place shortly afterwards with the entire presenting team being replaced by new signings including Alison Craig, Robin Galloway and Scottie McClue. Despite the new presenting line-up and a reported improvement in weekly listening figures to 350,000, complaints regarding format and regulatory problems led to another shake-up at management level. The station replaced its syndicated Reuters Radio news bulletins with an in-house service, although this had limited resources and was reportedly under-staffed with inexperienced young journalists who were even forced to travel by bus to help cut costs. In May 1995, Border Television pulled out of the company and sold its stake to Grampian, which became the sole owner of Scot FM. In another attempt to improve its fortunes, Scot FM brought exclusive rights to carry live Scottish Football League match commentaries for ¬£155,000 a year. This caused even further problems when Northsound (official broadcast partner with Aberdeen F.C.) complained as Scot FM did not cover the Aberdeen area. After two years in the role, Scot FM's managing director Tom Hunter resigned, another programme controller became ill with stress, and most of the presenting line-up departed. In 1996, Scot FM reported losses of around ¬£1 million. 1996 - 2000 In July 1996, Grampian sold Scot FM to the Independent Radio Group for ¬£5.25 million, The new owners aimed to make Scot FM profitable by 1998 and boost listening figures further by using the regional franchise to its advantage. Two months after the sale, Norman Quirk became Scot FM's managing director with Jeff Graham as programme controller. The station lost two of its presenters in 1997 - Scottie McClue left in January when contract negotiations broke down while Robin Galloway quit in March after a fallout with Jeff Graham. Both departures and those of several staff, who disagreed with Graham over a schedule revamp, led to a drop in listening figures, with half of its audience share disappearing - Scot FM had been reaching 16% of the population in the east and 14% in the west. IRG Chief Executive Michael Connolly claimed the station's new schedule was starting to regain lost listeners, while speaking of a three-year plan to turn its fortunes around. By the end of 1997, Jeff Graham was replaced by John Collins, prompting another programming revamp and the arrival of more new presenters, including Gary Marshall (breakfast), Dougie Jackson (mid-mornings) and Donny Hughes (drivetime). A revamp of news operationshttp://scotfm.tripod.com/SCFM- info2.htm saw Glenn Campbell become Scot FM's Head of News, presenting a daily 90-minute news magazine programme Lunchtime Live, which went on to win a silver Sony award in 1999 and a nomination at the New York Radio Awards. Robin Galloway also returned to Scot FM in March 1999, presenting a Sunday lunchtime show from his home studio in Manchester.HighBeam DJ Robin's home service, Daily Record (Glasgow, Scotland), 4 March 1999 Scot FM's owners IRG were brought by the Wireless Group in October 1999 for ¬£21 million. By this time, the station was still loss making, prompting the company to sell off Scot FM. After rejecting bids from Chrysalis and Scottish Radio Holdings (SRH offered ¬£29m but rejected due to competition commission issues), the Guardian Media Group brought the station for ¬£25.5 million in June 2001 - a sale which, at 13 times the annual revenue of Scot FM, allowed the station to clear its debts quickly. Analysts were surprised that TWG sold Scot FM, widely regarded as one of its best assets, rather than disposing of some of its 18 smaller stations. John Myers, chief executive of GMG Radio said: The problem with Scot FM is that it has changed owners faster than I've changed coats. It was badly launched. They gave an impression that they were going to do Radio 4 type speech and then they went and hired Scottie McClue. For the first time, Scot FM will have an owner that might actually give Scottish Radio Holdings a run for their money. Following the acquisition, GMG Radio relaunched and rebranded the station as Real Radio Scotland at 8am on Tuesday 8 January 2002. The station was latterly sold onto Global Radio in 2014, prompting a further relaunch as Heart Scotland in May 2014. Advertising Scot FM broadcast separate commercial breaks on both its Glasgow and Edinburgh frequencies (100.3 FM in the West and 101.1 FM in the East).

The gothic novel combines elements of terror and romance, and the supernatural. English novelist Fanny Burney wrote at the time of the French Revolution that, \\"There is nothing in old history that I shall any longer think fabulous; the destruction of the most wonderful empires on record has nothing more wonderful, nor of more sounding improbability, than the demolition of this great nation, which rises up against itself for its own ruin-perhaps annihilation.\\" A year later in 1790, English statesman Edmund Burke wrote that the French Revolution was, \\"the most astonishing that has hitherto happened to the world.\\" The gothic novel was therefore a way for English writers to come to terms with what they considered to be wonderful and astounding events, perceiving what happened to their neighbors in France and with the consequences upon their own society.Prickett, S: \\"England and the French Revolution\\", page 1. Macmillan Education, 1989 Creating elements of terror and fantasy gave expression to their anxieties of what was to come, and gave voice to their incredulousness at the events taking place in France. Because of the French Revolution and France's proximity to England, English writers during that period were concerned with the concept of violent and inclusive change in the human condition. The gothic novel contains modes of nightmarish terror, violence, and sexual rapacity. These modes coincided with the mood and modes of violence brought forth during the French Revolution. The upper echelon of English society mostly perceived the French Revolution as threatening to the status quo and stability of their accustomed lifestyle, and as a danger to their personal safety and social position within the hierarchy. It has been suggested that the gothic novel with its themes of terror and violence gave English writers a safe expression of their anxieties about disruption and chaos. They also worked to uphold the political normalcy and traditional morals of the time. Examples of this can be seen in Anne Radcliffe's female characters being submissive and incapable of making their own decisions, upholding traditional values of a patriarchal society. Feminism The dissent that occurred during the French Revolution was not only violent, it also led to women questioning their role in society and to a debate on the nature of women. This debate can be seen in one of the most famous gothic novels, Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. In her novel she engages in a discussion of women's nature by having a man with the power to create new life instead of the woman, and its consequences. Jane Austen also engaged in this discussion in her gothic novel, Northanger Abbey. Catherine Morland, the protagonist of the novel, has to confront the workings of the political and economic system that involves women as chess pieces in marriages and of power relationships, after her visions of romance are over. In this novel one can also see how the mind can take a truth by means other than texts, many times removed from actual events. This speaks to the perception that the English had of the French Revolution.Iversen, A: The Impact of the French Revolution on English Literature, page 40. Aarhus University Press, 1990 Caleb Williams The gothic novel, Caleb Williams by William Godwin can be seen as an example of the influence the events of the French revolution had on the genre. The main character, Caleb Williams is of humble birth, an unusual circumstance for Godwin to write, since his usual characters are about people of wealth and title.Gregory, A: \\"The French Revolution and the English Novel\\", page 93. The Knickerbocker Press, 1915 A key component of the French Revolution was the underlying principal that the political institutions of France should be founded on the equality of all citizens regardless of birth. The preface and subtitle of Caleb Williams also give the reader need to recognize social theory as the main purpose of the novel.Gregory, A: \\"The French Revolution and the English Novel\\", page 116. The Knickerbocker Press, 1915 This novel is classified as one of the best examples of the \\"victim-of-society story.Gregory, A: \\"The French Revolution and the English Novel\\", page 202. The Knickerbocker Press, 1915 The main character of this novel is a morbid individualist seized with a ruling passion amounting to mania, which no reason can overcome. In this way, the protagonist of this story can be seen as a caricature of a French Revolutionary.Gregory, A: \\"The French Revolution and the English Novel\\", page 223. The Knickerbocker Press, 1915 Before Caleb Williams, William Godwin published Political Justice underlining the philosophical principals that were pushing the French Revolution. He faced fierce hostility upon its publishing. With his later publishing of Caleb Williams a critic wrote, \\"Fancy is a faculty which we should not have expected to find in the brain of a philosopher who had struck his hand upon his heart and felt it stone; yet fancy Mr. Godwin possesses in no common degree.\\" Godwin's use of the fantastic in the form of the gothic novel again let him write about the philosophy of the French revolution without receiving the harsh backlash, because it was under the guise of the fantastic.Deane, S: \\"The French Revolution and Enlightenment in England 1789-1832,\\" page 85.

It was also known as Birmingham Corporation Waterworks Department. Early History 1808 - 1876 The earliest formal supply of water was offered by the Birmingham Waterworks Company. In 1808 notice of a Bill was given in Parliament for a scheme to provide Birmingham with an organised supply of water. It was opposed, and in 1809 a meeting considered the proposal, appointed a committee, and rejected the idea of the waterworks. A second Bill was rejected in 1811. It was not until 1826 that Parliament granted powers constituting The area to be supplied used only the River Tame. The initial supply was intermittent. In 1849, the Corporation made agreement with the Company for a constant supply in certain districts. By 1853 a constant supply was universal. The Grade II listed Birmingham Waterworks Tower at Edgbaston Waterworks was designed by John Henry Chamberlain and built in 1870. There is no connection to the nearby Edgbaston Reservoir, built to feed local canals, a hundred years previously. By 1873 the total quantity supplied was around per annum. Birmingham Corporation Water Department Pediment of Elan Aqueduct valve house with \\"Birmingham Corporation Water\\" wording Early developments The Birmingham Corporation Act of 1875 empowered Birmingham Corporation to purchase the Birmingham Waterworks Company. The transaction was supervised by the Mayor of Birmingham, Joseph Chamberlain, and completed on 1 January 1876 for the sum of ¬£1,350,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Chamberlain declared to a House of Commons committee > We have not the slightest intention of making profit...We shall get our > profit indirectly in the comfort of the town and in the health of the > inhabitants The rivers Bourne and Blythe, Plant's Brook and Perry Stream were used as sources. The corporation dug six wells at Aston, Short Heath, King's Vale, Perry Barr, Selly Oak (Selly Oak Pumping Station survives), and Longbridge. These provided per day. There were 14 reservoirs (including Aston Reservoir, Perry Barr, Witton Lakes and Brookvale) with a total capacity of . By 1891, population growth in the city was causing demand for water to outstrip supply. Elan aqueduct Foel Tower in the Elan Valley The Birmingham Corporation Water Act passed in 1892 authorised the purchase of land in Mid Wales on the upper portion of the Rivers Elan and Claerwen. Three reservoirs on the Elan and three on the Claerwen (collectively the \\"Elan Valley Reservoirs\\") were authorised, together with an aqueduct to carry the water to Birmingham. The engineer for the Elan aqueduct scheme was James Mansergh. Construction work started in 1893 and the Elan Valley Railway was built to aid construction.Steam nostalgia: locomotive and railway preservation in Great Britain. Gerald Nabarro King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra performed the official opening on 21 July 1904 although building works were not completed until near the end of 1906. The Elan aqueduct discharged into two reservoirs: Frankley Reservoir at Frankley and Bartley Reservoir at Bartley Green.Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, The Institution of Mechanical Engineers. 1910 The capacity of the aqueduct was increased with work starting in 1919.

Translations, the re-presentation of texts, graphic images, architecture, film and photography, and the staging of conflicting interpretations of events, are typical techniques. Migrations In his series of fourteen portraits Press The Star, Then Say Hello (2006) Li photographed customers of high-street internet booths in Manchester as they phoned 'home' abroad, their bodies in one space and their minds elsewhere. For his photobook The Mother of All Journeys (2003‚Äì2007), Li travelled with his elderly mother back to all her previous homes, in the UK, Hong Kong, and rural China, reflecting on the part photography plays in the construction of personal memory. Re-presentations In his photographic series Secret Shadows (2002) Li created 'portraits' of illegal migrants working in London's Chinese restaurant trade, through images of their possessions and living quarters. In We Write Our Own History (2017) he collaborated with political activists unable to safely reveal their identities, who restaged their unofficial, alternative memories of the 2014 Umbrella protests by arranging everyday items on table tops. Memory and Translation The Anatomy of Place (2007‚Äì2017) is a trilogy of films consisting of Ancestral Nation, 2007, Family Village, 2009, and Nation Family, 2017, three alternative translations of the Chinese written word 'country'. Video still of Nation Family (2017). Single channel video installation The animation Family Village was inspired by a newspaper article about a Sichuan town built in the style of Dorchester, England, an architectural translation from one vernacular to another. Li sourced a 1950s cartoon story book about a heroic Communist boy who intercepted enemy soldiers, creating an altered narrative overlaid with children chanting the song Pure Imagination from the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory in Mandarin. In Nation Family, Li constructed a fictional narrative inspired by an actual relative's time working in a Cultural Revolution labour camp. Li shows family photographs that are in fact propaganda, and he manipulates and translates film, props and songs into different media or visual languages. Exhibitions He has had solo exhibitions across the UK, including The Anatomy of Place, London, 2018, Age of Transition, Bedford, 2005, As If I were a River, Manchester, 2005 and Treasured Island, An Tobar, The Isle of Mull, 2001.

Previously known as Broxbourne Zoo, it was renamed Paradise Wildlife Park after it came under the management of the Sampson family in 1986.  History  The park was previously known as Broxbourne Zoo, which opened in the early 1960s. In 1984, the Sampson Family purchased the site with the intention of re-housing the animals into larger enclosures which mimicked their natural habitat, making them as comfortable as possible. The zoo was closed down for two years to undergo this transformation, and re-opened as \\"Paradise Park and Woodland Zoo\\", which was then shortened to Paradise Wildlife Park (PWP) in the 1990s. Since the Sampson family took over the Zoo, the team at PWP have continued researching, expanding and improving upon the animals' living conditions. Paradise Wildlife Park has developed a reputation through its conservation efforts, including The Wildlife Heritage Foundation (the sister site in Kent) which specialises in research and breeding of endangered species. Continued work and investment to improve the animal enclosures and public facilities and a drive to enhance the public perception of the park continued throughout the 1980s. The second stage of development included building new animal paddocks, improving the pathways, and increasing tree planting around the site. 1980s to 1990s The Sampson family, now dedicated to the park, chose to sell their \\"Sampson Coaches and Buses\\" company in 1989 and \\"MOT testing centre and garage\\" in 1990 to allow them to concentrate solely on the management and finance of Paradise Park and Woodland Zoo. In the early 1990s, the site's name was changed to \\"Paradise Wildlife Park\\" and work continued to improve the facilities. New spacious and open enclosures were built alongside \\"Tiger Lodge\\", a new purpose built enclosure constructed in 1994 for the zoo's Bengal and Siberian tigers. Improvements were also made to the park's non-animal areas, with three new themed adventure playgrounds introduced. All facilities at the site were given modern renovations, and changes were made to better accommodate and fulfil the needs of people with disabilities. 2000 and beyond Paradise Wildlife Park, like many animal attractions in England, was forced to close by the Foot and Mouth epidemic in the spring of 2001. Work continued on new enclosures for the animals with meerkats, otters, Brazilian tapirs, red pandas and European grey wolves joining the existing collection. Major work was undertaken to create new sections; \\"Squirrel Monkey Island\\", \\"Wonders of the Rainforest\\", \\"Cheetah Retreat\\" and \\"Toucan House\\". The Animal Resource Centre (ARC) is a new development which houses a veterinary and recovery room, animal food preparation areas, an animal records and research room, and large staff facilities. There has been extensive work completed on the paddock areas to improve drainage; overflow car parking facilities have been added; and improvements to the water supply were also made. Included in the upgrade were an electricity sub-station and back-up generator. \\"The Special Place'\\", a brand new play area adapted for use by children with disabilities, was also added. In 2001, Parkside Leisure, the parent company of Paradise Wildlife Park, purchased the site of the Big Cat Foundation in Kent, a sanctuary operated at the time by the Born Free Foundation. A new organisation was established by Paradise Wildlife Park called the Wildlife Heritage Foundation (WHF). During 2002 the Born Free Foundation and the Wildlife Heritage Foundation held a joint Dangerous Wild Animals Licence to operate the site. The site is now exclusively operated by the Wildlife Heritage Foundation, (registered charity number 1104420). The objective of the WHF is to support conservation in-situ and ex-situ projects and to assist with endangered species breeding programmes. Paradise Wildlife Park financially supports WHF.  Animals  Paradise Wildlife Park is home to over 500 animals, which include small mammals, paddock and farmyard animals, birds, primates, reptiles, and big cats. They house Siberian tigers, South African cheetahs, snow leopards, ocelot and jaguars. They also house white lions.Paradise Wildlife Park Breeding at Paradise Wildlife Park has been successful, with the breeding of endangered species such as marmosets, tamarins, Burmese pythons and lovebirds. Many animals are bred as part of the EEP Breeding Programme. Animals and wildlife at Paradise Wildlife Park are separated into several attractions including: * Big Cat Territory thumb thumb The big cat territory contains some of the most endangered big cat species in the world, including the cheetah, ocelot, white lions, snow leopards, jaguars and Amur tigers. * Hooves and Humps The hooves and humps section houses ungulate animals such as the endangered Bactrian camel, the African plains zebra, the Brazilian tapir and reindeer. * Farmyard The zoo has a variety of species of farmyard animals including pygmy goats, sheep, pigs and chickens among others. * Tropical Rainforest thumb Paradise Wildlife Park is home to the largest collection of small monkeys in the UK in its natural tropical rainforest house, including over 10 species of small monkeys as well as sloths, armadillos and several other tropical creatures. * Angkor reptile temple The Angkor Reptile Temple houses the largest Anaconda in the UK named Optimus Prime. The zoo also has over 35 different species of snakes, lizards, spiders, alligators, bugs and beetles. * Birds & aviary The section contains macaws, owls, eagles and lorikeets. * Small mammals Houses a collection of small mammals including meerkats, red pandas, otter and wallabies.

However, leprosy is not easily transmitted by casual contact or objects; actual transmission only happens through long-term, constant, intimate contact with leprosy sufferers and not through contact with everyday objects used by sufferers. Special leper colony money was used between 1901 and around 1955. The original reason for leper colony money was the prevention of leprosy in healthy persons. In 1938, Dr. Gordon Alexander Ryrie in Malaysia proved that the paper money was not contaminated with leprosy bacteria, and all the leper colony banknotes were burned in that country.Kue Issho (1979) p. 39.

The first special money The oldest special money known was made in 1901 for use in three leper colonies of Colombia, called Agua de Dios, Cano de Loro, and Contrataci√≥n. Five denominations of coins were issued: 2.5 centavos, 5 centavos, 10 centavos, 20 centavos, and 50 centavos. \\"Rep√∫blica de Colombia 1901\\" was engraved.The numismatic aspects of leprosy (1993), McFadden, RR, Grost J, Marr DF. p. 21 D.

Special money made in the US Between 1919 and 1952, special coins were used in a Panama Canal Zone leper colony called Palo Seco Colony. One cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, and one dollar coins were made in the United States, with one hole in the coins.The numismatic aspects of leprosy (1993), p. 54. Philippines From 1913 to 1930, special aluminum (later copper-nickel) coins were minted in Manila for use in the Culion leper colony of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands (then under the United States). In 1942, during the Japanese occupation of World War II, emergency paper money was also issued inside the Culion colony. The currency was discontinued after leprosy became a treatable disease in the 1980s, and the island of Culion itself was declared leprosy- free in 2006. Japan In 1919, special coins were made in Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium, and later in other sanatoriums in Japan. It is a characteristic of the special money of Japan that coins and in some cases money in papers or plastic were issued by the sanatoriums and not by the government. However, patients liked banknotes or coins of the Japan Bank. When patients were hospitalized, their money was changed for special money, so that this system was used also for the strengthening of segregation. In some sanatoriums, special money served as allowances for poor patients. By 1955 this system had been discontinued in Japan, in some cases initiated by crimes.Kue Issho (1979) Ikko Sha, TokyoAkebonono Shiokaze (1998) Nihon Bunkyo Shuppan, Okayama Malaysia In 1936, 5 cents, 10 cents and 1 dollar notes were issued in the Sungei Buloh Settlement in Federated Malay States (today Malaysia), printed in four languages. The director, Dr. Gordon Alexander Ryrie, sent the special banknotes for examination and it was proved that the notes did not carry leprosy. All special banknotes were burned in a bonfire in that country in 1938.

Early life Alfred Young Nutt was born in 1847 in the small Leicestershire village of Burrough on the Hill, south-east of Melton Mowbray. He was the youngest of fifteen children to Reverend William Young Nutt, who was for thirty-five years curate of Burrough, and Rector of Cold Overton 1852 ‚Äì 74. Following an education at Oakham, Nutt took up an apprenticeship at an architectural practice in Leicester in 1861 where he remained for six years, during which time he was befriended by an artist called Harry Ward who later became a resident of Windsor. This connection led to Alfred taking up a position at the Office of Works of Windsor Castle in 1867 as a draughtsman.Oxley, N, In Service to Three Monarchs, pub. Windsor, NEO 1996, Work in Windsor 1888 sketch by Nutt of the vault under the choir, St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle showing coffins of King Henry VIII (centre, damaged), Queen Jane (right), King Charles I with a child of Queen Anne (left) Given his junior status in the Office, much of Nutt's early work is not clearly attributable to him, but one early identifiable work was a detailed scaled drawing of the Royal Vault in St George's Chapel in preparation for major refurbishment work to be carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott carried out between 1870 and 1871. It was this work which secured Nutt appointment as Surveyor to the Dean and Canons of St George's in 1873, having been rejected for the vacant post of Clerk of Works of Windsor Castle. In May 1898 The London Gazette announced his conformation in the post of Clerk of Works of Windsor Castle and he held the post concurrently with that of Chapel Surveyor, through annual reappointment, until his retirement in 1912. Later work Nutt was commissioned to design and construct temporary annexes for Westminster Abbey for the coronations of both King Edward VII and King George V.National Archive Record Details of Drawings for Coronation of George V For his service to the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, he was invested as a Member (fifth class) of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) two days after the ceremony, on 11 August 1902. Ecclesiastical projects Tomb of Emperor Napoleon III at St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Chislehurst, dated 1879 Nutt was a keen churchman and undertook several commissions for architectural work in the Church of England, many through contacts he had made during his time at Windsor. These varied from St John the Evangelist, Little Leighs, Essex, where Nutt undertook general restoration work (in particular, to the porch, chancel screen and pulpit) to the construction of England's first concrete church, St John and St Mary Magdalene in Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire on the commission of Lord Halifax.The Buildings of England, Yorkshire:The West Riding, Pevsner, N., Harmondsworth, 1959, 2nd edn. 1967. Community work and recognition Nutt was renowned for his Christmas cards, which he designed himself, several of which are on display in the collection of the Windsor and Royal Borough Museum.

His sire was the great Gallant Fox, the 1930 U.S. Triple Crown winner and a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee. Flares was a full brother to Woodward's 1935 U.S. Triple Crown champion, Omaha. Determined to win England's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the Ascot Gold Cup, in 1936 Woodward sent the then four-year-old Omaha to compete in England, where he ran second in the Ascot Gold Cup. When Flares was a yearling in 1934, Woodward shipped him to trainer Cecil Boyd-Rochfort at his base in Newmarket, England. Racing at age three, in mid-May 1936 Flares won the Newmarket Stakes.

Through the 16th and 18th century known by the name Mesti√ßo (Dutch: Mestiezen). To this day they form one of the largest Eurasian communities in the world. The early beginning of this community started with the arrival of Portuguese traders in South East Asia in the 16th century. The second large wave started with the arrival of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) employees in the 17th century and throughout the 18th century. Even though the VOC is often considered a state within a state, formal colonisation by the Dutch only commenced in the 19th century.  The position of Indos in pre-colonial Dutch East Indies history (16th, 17th and 18th century)  Before the formal colonization of the East Indies by the Dutch in the 19th century, the islands of South East Asia had already been in frequent contact with European traders. Portuguese maritime traders were present as early as the 16th century. Around its trading posts the original Portuguese Indo population, called Mesti√ßo,Leirissa, R. Article 'Ambon and Ternate through the 19th century', in 'Authority and enterprise among the people of South Sulawesi' (Bijdragen in taal land en volkenkunde by University of Leiden, 156, 2000 no.3, 619-633, KITLV, Leiden.) p.242 had developed. In the 17th century the Dutch started to expand its mercantile enterprise and military presence in the East Indies in an effort to establish trade monopolies to maximise profit. Even after the Portuguese competition was beaten by the Dutch maritime traders of the VOC, the Portuguese Indo (aka Mesti√ßo) communities remained active in local and intra-island trade.Leirissa, R. Article 'Ambon and Ternate through the 19th century', in 'Authority and enterprise among the people of South Sulawesi' (Bijdragen in taal land en volkenkunde by University of Leiden, 156, 2000 no.3, 619-633, KITLV, Leiden.) p.247 The Dutch found merit in collaboration with these early Eurasian communities through their role as intermediaries with local traders, but also to help mitigate the threat of the encroaching British traders.The Dutch did exactly the same thing in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) when they expelled all the Portuguese 1653. They permitted the Portuguese-Jewish Marrano, and the Portuguese-Sinhalese Mesti√ßo to stay. These people became founders of the Ceylon based Eurasian group called Burghers.Portuguese colonial history In the first century of Dutch (VOC) dominance the cultural influence of the Portuguese Indo population continued as can be seen by the fact that Portuguese Malay mix languages remained in existence well into the second century of the VOC era and autonomous Portuguese Indo groups existed into the 19th century. To this day several surviving families of Portuguese descent can still be found in the Indo community. Family names include: Dias, Pereira, Rozario, Simao.  Portuguese roots of Indo society  Painting of a Portuguese Mardijker and his wife, 1704. Originally the greatest source of profit in the East Indies, was the intra-islands trade within the archipelago (Dutch: inlandse handel) and the intra-Asiatic trade in general. Here one commodity was exchanged for another, with profit at each turn. This included the trade of silver from the Americas, more desirable in the East than in Europe.See Fernand Braudel The Perspective of the World. In: Civilization and Capitalism, vol. III (1984) and De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 386. In this trade the original Indo or Mestizo population remained to play an intermediary role. > The VOC made good use of such (Indo) people, born and brought up locally. > They could speak the language of their birth country and understood its > conventions, and proved excellent middlemen for the Europeans.

To this day the Indonesian language has a relatively large vocabulary of words with Portuguese roots e.g. Sunday, party, soap, table, flag, school. The census taken of the population of Ambon island in 1860, still showed 778 Dutch Europeans and 7793 mostly Mesti√ßo and Ambonese 'Burghers'. Portuguese/Malay speaking Indo communities existed not only in the Moluccas,Creole Portuguese that was spoken by Moluccan mestizo in the islands of Ternate and West Halmahera, is now extinct. The Creole Portuguese of Ambon is also extinct, but considerable linguistic traces of Portuguese can still be found in the Malay/Ambon language still spoken on Ambon, which has about 350 words of Portuguese origin. FloresIn Flores Portuguese survives in the religious traditions. The Topasses Mesti√ßo community (the descendants of Portuguese men and local women) uses it in the prayers. On Saturdays the women of Larantuka say the rosary in a creole form of Portuguese.Ricklefs, M.

But Portuguese remains an official national language and the Mesti√ßo still play an important political role in the country. But also in Batavia (now Jakarta) where it remained the dominant language up to 1750.Many Portuguese family names can be found on the islands of Ambon, Flores and East Timor. Although most Portuguese family names were adopted after conversion to the Christian religion, many families can still trace back their roots to Portuguese ancestors. Some family names of old Indo families include Simao, De Fretes, Perera, Henriques, etc. Rumphius, G.E. ‚ÄòDe Ambonse landbeschrijving‚Äô (Landelijk steunpunt educatie Molukkers, Utrecht, 2002) Justus M. Van Der Kroef 'The Indonesian Eurasian and His Culture' Braga Collection National Library of Australia Family tree Indo Eurasian family with Portuguese roots Timeline Milestones 1 The longevity of Portuguese cultural influence exerted via their Eurasian population is explained by the inclusive approach they had towards their national identity. Portuguese Admiral Afonso de Albuquerque (1453-1515) stated:Neijndorff, Frank Een Indo in Holland (Publisher: Indonet, Rotterdam, 1997) P.6 > \\"Colonies and natives are not mere possessions to be exploited.

In this conception skin > colour is no more than a mere coincidence.\\"  Portuguese Creole Language  For the Mestizo-Indo of the pre-colonial era their first language was often the Portuguese creole language called Portugis, based on Malay and Portuguese. It remained the dominant lingua franca for trade throughout the archipelago from the 16th century through the early 19th century. Many Portugis words survive in the Indonesian language including: sabun (from sab√£o = soap), meja (from mesa = table), boneka (from boneca = doll), jendela (from janela = window), gereja (from igreja = church), bola (from bola = ball), bendera (from bandeira = flag), roda (from roda = wheel), gagu (from gago = stutterer), sepatu (from sapato = shoes), kereta (from carreta = wagon), bangku (from banco = chair), keju (from queijo = cheese), garpu (from garfo = fork), terigu (from trigo = flour), mentega (from manteiga = butter), Minggu (from domingo = Sunday) and Belanda (from Holanda = Dutch). The word Sinyo (from Se√±or) was used for Indo boy and young man and the word Nona or the variation Nonni (from Dona) for Indo girls or young women. In yet another derivation of the original Portuguese word that means lady a mature Indo woman was called Nyonya, sometimes spelled Nonya. This honorific loan word came to be used to address all women of foreign descent.Note: The word Nyonya came to be used for all women who appeared foreign, including Straits-Chinese women. In Malaysia the term is now associated exclusively with peranakan Chinese women. In contemporary Javanese Nona still means lady. See: Soeseno Kartomihardjo, Ethnography of Communicative Codes in East Java Dept. of Linguistics, Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University: 1981, , page 96  Mardijker people  Another notable Portuguese/Malay speaking group were the Mardijker people, which the VOC legally acknowledged as a separate ethnic group. Most of them were freed Portuguese slaves with ethnic roots in India, but of Christian faith. Eventually the term came into use for any freed slave and is the word from which the Indonesian word 'Merdeka' meaning freedom is derived.The Dutch word ‚ÄòMardijker‚Äô is a corruption of the Portuguese version of the original sanskrit word ‚ÄòMaharddhika‚Äô, usually translated into ‚Äòfree man‚Äô. This group and its descendants heavily inter-married with the Portuguese Mesti√ßo community. Kampung Tugu was a famous Mardijker settlement in Batavia, but Mardijker quarters could be found in all major trading posts including Ambon and Ternate.Leirissa, R. Article ‚ÄòAmbon and Ternate through the 19th century‚Äô, in ‚ÄòAuthority and enterprise among the people of South Sulawesi‚Äô (Bijdragen in taal land en volkenkunde by University of Leiden, 156, 2000 no.3, 619-633, KITLV, Leiden.) p.249 The majority of this group eventually assimilated completely into the larger Indo Eurasian community and disappear from the records. Into the 18th century Indo culture remained dominantly Portuguese/Malay in nature.To the dismay of the Dutch Indo Eurasian culture was strongly influenced by its Portuguese and Malay origins. See: Boxer C.R. ‚ÄòThe Dutch Seaborne Empire 1600‚Äì1800‚Äô (Penguin 1991) p.221-226  Topasses people  An independent group of Mesti√ßo of Portuguese descent were the Topasses people who were based in Solor, Flores and pre-dominantly Timor. The community in Larantuka on Flores called themselves Larantuqueiros. This powerful group of Mesti√ßo controlled the sandalwood trade and strongly opposed the Dutch. They manifested themselves very independently and actually fought many wars with both the Dutch and Portuguese in the 17th and 18th century. Portuguese Mesti√ßo that chose not to cooperate with the Dutch and VOC deserters often joined with the Topasses. This group eventually assimilated into the indigenous nobility and Eurasian elite of East Timor. Famous family clans are 'De Hornay' and 'Da Costa', that survive as Timorese Raja to this day.Fox, James, J. ‚Äò‚ÄôOut of the ashes‚Äò‚Äô (ANUE Press, Australian National University, 2003) Chapter 1: Tracing the past, recounting the past.

High mortality rates among its employees were common. To a degree racial mixing was even encouraged by the VOC, as it was aiming to establish a prominent and consistent presence in the East Indies.Van Boven, M.W., ‚ÄòTowards A New Age of Partnership (TANAP): An Ambitious World Heritage Project‚Äô, (UNESCO Memory of the World ‚Äì reg.form, 2002) VOC Archives Appendix 2 .Boxer C.R. ‚ÄòThe Dutch Seaborne Empire 1600‚Äì1800‚Äô (Penguin 1991) p.220 A considerable number of these men can be considered emigrant settlers, that had no intention of leaving the East Indies,One notable example of a permanent settler is Cornelis Houtman, Admiral and Governor General creating their own local Indo Eurasian families. Moreover, the VOC needed larger European representation to run its local business and therefore stimulated growth in numbers of an Indo population of Dutch descent. These Indos played important roles as VOC officials. VOC representatives, called residents, at the royal courts were often Indos able to speak the indigenous languages.A notable example is VOC official Van Velsen, Resident at the Court of Mataram in 1841.

From this European outpost on Kisar a relatively large and almost forgotten Indo Eurasian community developed named the Mestizo of Kisar. To this day their descendants live as Rajas and chiefs on Kisar. Surviving, mostly Dutch, family names include: Joostenz, Wouthuysen, Caffin, Lerrick, Peelman, Lander, Ruff, Bellmin-Belder, Coenradi, van Delsen, Schilling and Bakker. In 1795 the Kisar Mestizio were under English rule, in 1803 under Dutch/French rule and in 1810 again under English rule. 1817 Kisar was returned to Dutch rule until the outpost was abandoned in 1819. After that time Kisar Mestizo upheld close ties with their Mestizo neighbours on Timor and by and large integrated into indigenous society. The Kisar Mestizo were made famous in 1928 by the German Professor E.Rodenwaldt who published his study \\"Die Mestizen auf Kisar\\", \\"Mikroskopische Beobachtungen an den Haaren der Kisaresen und Kisarbastarde\\".Book in Open Library. His two volume work details measurements and photographs of the observed Kisar Mestizos and contains a family tree showing the very complicated inter-marriages between the descendants of Mestizo families, as well as indicating skin, eye, and hair colour heredity. The study shows a unique natural experiment spanning over two centuries and is considered an essential academic work in the area of human heredity.Mixed Race Studies Website.Family website.

Indo society  Pre-colonial Indo culture dominated the European segment of society in the East Indies. This culture was heavily Eurasian i.e. hybrid in nature and even the most high ranking Dutch VOC officials were absorbed by it. Indo society was polygot and its first languages were Malay, Portugis and other creole languages, not Dutch. It was also matriarchal and most Europeans, even the VOC governor- generals would marry into Indo clans. Only by doing so they were able to obtain the necessary connections, patronage, wealth and know how.Taylor, Jean Gelman. The Social World of Batavia: European and Eurasian in Dutch Asia P.78 and P.93(Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1983). > \\"Women based clans absorbed the immigrant males who came without wives. the > clan enfolded the newcomer in a network of immigrants with locally born > wives, mestizo (Indo) and Asian (Indonesian) kin alike. In the same time the > clan eased the adoption of Indies manners for the newcomers.\\" Historian Jean > Gelman Taylor in The social world of Batavia, European and Eurasian in Dutch > Asia. The arts and crafts patronized by the Indo elite were usually indigenous e.g. gamelan, batik, various court dances, etc. In their immediate personal habitat they were closely surrounded by indigenous servants. Overall lifestyle was similar to the indigenous elite. Women clothing was often indistinguishable from indigenous fancy dress and many practices were rooted in ancient indigenous court culture. In an attempt to mitigate cultural dominance of Indo society the expatriate aristocrat baron van Imhoff (1705‚Äì1750), VOC governor from 1743 to 1750, founded several institutions to cultivate Dutch culture among the native colonial elite. His Naval Academy for maritime VOC officers in Batavia was exemplary in its aim to foster western identity. Van Imhoff showed how well he understood the strength of the Indo-Europeans' indigenous derived beliefs and manners when he decreed that even the academy's cooks, stewards and servants were to be European. Another academy decree strictly stipulated: \\"There shall be no native tongues spoken in the house.\\"Taylor, Jean Gelman. The Social World of Batavia: European and Eurasian in Dutch Asia P.85(Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1983). Next governors also vainly tried to introduce the Dutch language in the VOC operated schools and churches, but Portugis and Malay remained the dominant languages. Even the highest VOC officials were unable to pass on their own mother tongue to their offspring. In general the VOC had always recognised the tendency of its servants to be absorbed by the hybrid Indo culture and repeatedly issued regulations limiting higher company positions to men born in the Netherlands.

In 2003, IHI began updating the engine with a more advanced Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). This updated engine was designated the F3-IHI-30C. XF3-400 Soon after IHI began working on the XF-3, they began developing a more powerful variant of the engine as a technology demonstrator for a theoretical supersonic fighter. This engine was designated the XF3-400. It was designed to be a higher performance, afterburning version of the XF-3, producing around of thrust. One distinctive quality of this engine was that it was to have a thrust-to-weight ratio of 7:1, higher than any similarly sized engine.Kashikawa, I., & Akagi, M. (1995). Research on a High Thrust-to-Weight Ratio Small Turbofan Engine. Presented at the 31st AlAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit, San Diego, CA: American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Work on this engine began in earnest in 1986, and a demonstrator engine was built and tested in 1987. IHI was formally awarded a contract for the engine in 1992, after spending the previous years developing and testing the engine internally. The primary difference between the XF3-400 and the standard F3-30 is the inclusion of an afterburner. Adding the afterburner is the primary reason why the maximum thrust of the -400 is much higher than the -30. Other changes included compressor and turbine blades that were aerodynamically optimized using 3D computational fluid dynamics techniques, and improved temperature performance in the high-pressure turbine. A 1998 report revealed that thrust vectoring was also being integrated into the XF3-400.Japan stalls future fighter demonstrator. (1998, October 21). Flight International. Retrieved February 4, 2010. Design The F3 is a two-shaft (or two spool) low-bypass turbofan. It features a two-stage fan (low-pressure compressor) on the low-pressure shaft, followed by a five-stage high-pressure compressor on the high-pressure shaft. The engine uses an annular combustor, which feeds a single-stage high-pressure turbine followed by a single-stage low-pressure turbine. The XF3-400 variant includes an afterburner after the low-pressure turbine, the production F3 does not. The two-stage fan uses wide chord blades, and both the production F3 and the advanced XF3-400 use the same fan. Unlike the fan, the five-stage compressor differs between the F3 and the XF3-400, with the advanced XF3-400 benefiting from 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) improvements. The high-pressure turbine blades are single-crystal blades, and they are cooled by a thin film of air from inside of the blades. The low-pressure turbine blades, like the high-pressure compressor, were improved between the F3 and the XF3-400 using 3D CFD. Both the F3 and the XF3-400 use a FADEC for engine control.

The design became the first of its kind to become certified with the FAA, achieving certification in October 1998, and remains the only aircraft ballistic parachute used as standard equipment by an aviation company. Developed as a collaboration between Cirrus and Ballistic Recovery Systems (BRS), it was adapted from the GARD (General Aviation Recovery Device) initially released for the Cessna 150. As in other BRS systems, a small solid-fuel rocket housed in the aft fuselage is used to pull the parachute out from its housing and deploy the canopy full within seconds. The goal of employing this system is the survival of the crew and passengers and not necessarily the prevention of damage to the airframe. Design and development Since the landing gear and firewall are a part of the structure designed to be crushed for energy absorption during impact after parachute deployment, Cirrus originally thought that the airframe would be damaged beyond repair on ground-impact, but the first aircraft to deploy (N1223S) landed in mesquite and was not badly damaged. Cirrus bought the airframe back, repaired it, and used it as a demo plane. It was eventually sold to another owner who destroyed it in a crash short of the runway. Dating back to the first conception of the Cirrus SR20, the aircraft was intended to come equipped with CAPS. Because of this, Cirrus designed a special kind of \\"spin resistant\\" wing (or leading edge cuff), which makes it more difficult for the plane to enter a spin, and thus, more difficult to recover from one. The FAA accepted the parachute as a sufficient mode of spin recovery and complete spin testing was not required. However, in 2004, Cirrus completed a limited series of spin recovery tests to meet European Safety Agency requirements, and no unusual characteristics were found. Vision Jet The first jet with a ballistic parachute, the Cirrus Vision SF50 single-engine jet was certified in October 2016 with CAPS (where it deploys from the nose of the aircraft instead of the aft cabin). Despite the FAA not requiring Cirrus to test the device since it was not necessary for certification, Business Insider released video in May 2017 showing CAPS being tested inflight with a piloted SF50 prototype. In 2018, Cirrus won the Collier Trophy for the Vision Jet, due in part to the aircraft's inclusion of CAPS. The award is presented annually for \\"the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in America, with respect to improving the performance, efficiency, and safety of air or space vehicles\\". History The idea for CAPS came in 1985 from Cirrus‚Äô founders, brothers Alan and Dale Klapmeier, after Alan survived a mid-air collision where his plane lost more than three feet of wing including half the aileron; the pilot in the other aircraft spiraled into the ground and was killed. From this experience, the Klapmeier brothers decided to implement a device on their Cirrus models that would give the pilot and passengers a way out in the worst-case scenario. These efforts contributed to their later induction into the National Aviation Hall of Fame. The Cirrus engineering & design team, led by Paul Johnston, started developing CAPS on the SR20 in Duluth, Minnesota during the mid-1990s. It was first tested in 1998 over the high desert of southern California by late Air National Guard F-16 pilot and Cirrus chief test pilot, Scott D. Anderson. Anderson completed all seven of the in-flight test deployments of CAPS for development and certification of the SR20. The first emergency deployment occurred in 2002 over Lewisville, Texas, and resulted in the survival of one uninjured pilot operating an SR22. Deployments As of 18 December 2018, CAPS has been activated 98 times, 83 of which saw successful parachute deployment. In those successful deployments, there were 170 survivors and 1 fatality. No fatalities have occurred when the parachute was deployed within the certified speed and altitude parameters, and only one anomalous unsuccessful deployment has ever occurred within those parameters. Some additional deployments have been reported by accident, as caused by ground impact or post-impact fires, and 19 of the aircraft involved in CAPS deployments have been repaired and put back into service. Post 2011, the year of their highest fatality rate to date, Cirrus has experienced an increase in CAPS deployments coinciding with a steady decrease in fatal accidents, giving them one of the best safety records in the industry and less than half the industry average. This was attributed to a new approach to training, particularly in when to deploy the parachute system.

Most of Malaysian Telugus today are 5th or 6th generation who migrated during the colonial period. While most of current Malaysian Telugu ancestors originated from what is now Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, substantial number of them originated from area of Orissa and Bengal state. While most Telugus come to Malaysia as labourers, some were professionals and traders who arrived as refugees. In 1930s anti Indian riots in Burma results in large number of ethnic Telugus fleeing from Burma either back to India, Thailand or Malaya. Another wave of Telugu migration from Burma occurs during world war two, when Japanese invaded Burma. In recent years new wave of migration of Telugu speaking population from India results in some rejuvenation of Telugu linguistic interest in Malaysia. In 1981 the Second World Telugu Conference was held in Kuala Lumpur. Telugu Association of Malaysia, a non profit NGO serves as representative of Malaysian Telugus and is platform for Telugus to voice their opinions. The Telugu Association was first formed in the region of Lower Perak District in Malaysia on 17 July 1955, under the banner of Malaya Andhra Sangamu and officially registered on 17 February 1956. On 16 December 1963 it was renamed as Malaysia Andhra Sangamu. The association name evolved from 1983 onwards as Telugu Association of Malaysia (TAM) which is also known as Malaysia Telugu Sangamu. The association is formally registered and operates under the banner of as Persatuan Telugu Malaysia in Bahasa Malaysia.  History  Telugus along with other Indians from the east coast of India and the Bengal Bay arrived to the shores of ancient Suvarnabhumi (referring to Malay Peninsula and Lower Burma, meaning \\"Land of Gold\\" in Telugu language) and other parts of Southeast Asia. Indians from Godavari basin arrived in ancient Malay peninsular, trading and settling down, thus influencing local customs and culture. Sejarah Melayu addressed India as Benua Keling and Indians as \\"Keling\\", a word taken from Kalinga, an ancient Indian kingdom which is likely the source of Indian influence over Southeast Asia. Kalinga is located at the northern part of Andhra Pradesh covering Godavari basin and the southern part of Orissa and people of this region now speak either Telugu or Oriya. The current population of Malaysian Telugus are mostly third and fourth generation Telugus who descended from indentured laborers under the kangani system who arrived in the 19th and early 20th century. Some also paid their own passage after the Kangani system ended in the early 20th century. Most of the Telugus migrants to the Malay peninsula during the colonial era were from northern coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh, often recruited by maistries or kanganis (foremen) from the Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam regions, with some from the East Godavari and Chittoor regions. The migrants usually shared the same neighbourhood background, blood ties or caste connections. Telugus who arrived during British colonial era were mainly non-Brahmin middle-ranking or low caste Hindus from the Kamma and Reddy to the untouchables, and included the Gavara, Kapu, and Velama, with some from the Chakali, Mangali (barber) and others castes. Another recruitment centre was Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu. While the Indian immigrants in the early period were predominantly men, the Telugus were more willing to bring with them their womenfolk. The Telugus were most commonly found in the rubber and coconut plantations in Perak (such as Telok Anson), Johor, and Kedah. As the Telugus formed only a small minority of Indians in British Malaya with Tamils the great majority, they weren't particularly visible as a group and thus their identity was subsumed into the larger group of South Indians. They were referred to as Klings or Madrasis used as general terms for South Indians. In 1955, the Malaya Andhra Sanghamu (later Malaysia Andhra Sanghamu) was formed to support the Telugu community, foster their culture and promote their language. More recently, an increasing number of Telugu expatriates have arrived from India.  Population  The Malaysian Telugus form the third largest group of Indians in Malaysia. In British Malaya they formed around 4% of the Indian population. The Malaysian Origin Telugu population is estimated to be 119,000 in 2020.  Language  Telugu language is the native language of Malaysian Telugus, It is the world's most spoken Dravidian and it comes under the category of \\"South Central Dravidian\\" language family. Until late 1980s there were few primary Telugu medium schools. These schools were poorly maintained and there were support by the estate owners only. The last of Telugu school were closed in 1990 due to socioeconomic reasons and urbanization of Telugu people .There was no Indian political party in Malaysia to voice out Telugu people concerns. Some Telugus (along with other Indian minority groups) also had start adopting and assimilating into the majority Tamil language and culture due to Tamil dominance. There was resurgence in learning Telugu language following political and financial support from the Malaysian government .There was an increase in students enrollment in Telugu classes conducted by Telugu Association of Malaysia with partial financial support from government of Malaysia. Today there are more than 5000 new generation of students who can read and write in Telugu language.

Some machines even replicate hand stitching,Sashiko Baby Lock machine for example Sashiko or running stitch quilting. History Quilting or stitching together layers of padding and fabric, may date back as far as 3400 BCE. While sewing machines are commonly used to piece such quilts as patchwork tops, it is rare to find a vintage quilt that was not hand quilted. Regular (domestic) sewing machines have been used to hold layers of a quilt together since they were invented, however, it wasn't until the 1990s that this productive skill became acceptable and has now replaced hand quilting in popularity. Quilting in the past was primarily a practical technique to provide insulation, although decorative elements were often also present. Quilting is now a popular hobby and many modern quilts are primarily art pieces. Modern quilting has existed in many forms for much of the 20th century. It wasn't until the 2000s that quilts with a modern aesthetic began to appear in greater numbers and quilters began to describe themselves as modern. The growth of the modern quilting movement was facilitated by the following factors: the art being recognized by the general public, the availability of affordable digital photography equipment, the changes in the fabric industry and increased use of social media. Techniques To begin any machine quilting, the three layers of the quilt, the quilt top, batting and backing fabric, are temporarily basted either with safety pins or with basting spray. Stitching in a straight line is normally accomplished by replacing the normal presser foot with an even feed walking foot attachment. This gadget was designed to avoid puckering by advancing multiple layers at the same rate as the feed dogs of the machine. With the feed dogs up, the length of the stitch is controlled by the stitch length setting of the machine. Free-motion quilting Free-motion quilting is a process used to stitch the layers of a quilt together using a domestic sewing machine with the feed dogs lowered, with a darning foot installed. When the feed dogs are lowered they do not advance the fabric; and with the darning foot merely hovering over the layers, the operator controls the stitch length as well as the direction of the stitching line by moving the quilt with their hands. The stitching can be made in any direction and to for curvilinear lines or straight patterns. Each design, whether drawn on the quilt top or held in the imagination of the quilter, is formed with a line of stitching that is guided by the movement of the quilt under the machine needle. The length of each stitch is determined by the distance the quilt has been moved since the previous stitch. Joanie's Quilting Elements: 7 Simple Steps to Navigate and Stitch, by Joanie Zeier Poole, KP Publishing, Quilter's Workshop Series, 2008 Heirloom machine quilting Heirloom machine quilting is a more advanced quilting technique using a sewing machine. In 1985, Harriet Hargrave coined the term heirloom machine quilting. It was Hargrave's determination to use her domestic sewing machine to replicate the look of hand quilting that compelled her to originate this art. For heirloom machine quilting, the operator uses advanced free- motion techniques. The scale of the work is refined, using smaller threads and needles that allow the use of detailed and complex patterns. Quilts with heirloom machine quilting usually include background quilting which fills the negative space around the designs with dense stitching. This creates contrast between the curvilinear shapes and the flattened background space using stippling, echo quilting, repeated patterns, or geometric grids. The intricate quilted designs produce three dimensions on the surface of the quilt through the play of light and shadows. Motifs puff up, appear brighter because the high areas catch the light; while low areas recede into the depth of the shadow.Heirloom Machine Quilting, 4th Edition: by Harriet Hargrave (C&T; Publishing, 2004) See also *Longarm quilting *Quilting References Category:Quilting ","title":"Machine quilting"},{"id":"26134242","text":"HD 156668 is a star in the northern constellation of Hercules constellation. With an apparent visual magnitude of 8.4 it is too faint to be viewed with the naked eye, but it can be seen with even a small telescope. The distance to this object has been determined directly using the parallax technique, yielding a value of about . This star has the stellar classification of a K2 dwarf, with approximately 77% of the mass of the Sun and about 72% of the Sun's diameter. While they are on the main sequence, lower mass stars like this generate energy much more slowly than the Sun. As a result, this star is radiating only 23% of the Sun's bolometric luminosity. HD 156668 is emitting this energy from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of around 4850 K, giving it the cool orange glow of a K-type star. It is slightly more enriched in iron compared to the Sun and is rotating at a leisurely rate of once every 51.5 days. Although much older than the Sun, this star is only middle-aged at about 8.6 billion years. Observations From 1911 to 1915, Photographic Stellar Spectrum surveysThe Henry Draper Catalogue, Annie J. Cannon and Edward C. Pickering, Annals of Harvard College Observatory; hours 0 to 3, 91 (1918), ; hours 4 to 6, 92 (1918), ; hours 7 to 8, 93 (1919), ; hours 9 to 11, 94 (1919), ; hours 12 to 14, 95 (1920), ; hours 15 to 16, 96 (1921), ; hours 17 to 18, 97 (1922), ; hours 19 to 20, 98 (1923), ; hours 21 to 23, 99 (1924), . have been carried out by Annie Jump Cannon and Edward Charles Pickering. Anna Mary Palmer who was Henry Draper's wife financed the study, it was also her husband who was responsible for the star's designation in the Henry Draper Catalogue with subsequent extension (HD) although it was first designated as BD+29 2979 in the original catalogue that was published in 1863 by Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander due to its position and brightness of 324,198 stars between +90¬∞ and ‚àí2¬∞ declination in the span of an 11-year observation. A number of proper motion surveys was published in 1957 where 9,867 stars in the Southern hemisphere where high proper motion was detected. The name BD was taken from a catalogue of the Bonner Durchmusterung (Bonn Survey) where observations are abbreviated as BD. Latter study expansions were carried out by the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung observatory in C√≥rdoba, Argentina and further extensions by Henry Lee Giclas who designated the star as G 181-34 in the Giclas catalogues. From 1990 to 1993, HD 156668 was observed at least twice and was featured at the 6th annual catalog of the Tokyo Photoelectric Meridian Circle (PMC) where it is one of 6649 stars observed. Super-Earth Andrew Howard announced the discovery of a Super-Earth in orbit around HD 156668. This planet is designated HD 156668 b. The announcement was made at the 215th American Astronomical Society meeting on January 4 to 7, 2010 in Washington D.C.. The planet orbits its star in only 4.6 days with a distance approximately 0.05 AU away from the parent star. The researchers used the wobble method where the resulting spectrum showed color shifts which was used to approximate the mass of the astronomical object. The observation revealed data that the exoplanet was at least 4.15 Earth masses. Later observations revealed that the minimum mass is now 3.1 Earth masses.

He was the brother of painters Vilhelm and Fritz Melbye.  Biography  His father was a Royal Customs officer. He had originally planned on a naval career but, because of his myopia, was sent to learn shipbuilding instead.Biographical notes (in Danish). @ Kunstindeks Danmark. His inclinations for music and art asserted themselves, however, and he left engineering school to learn the guitar. Eddystone Lighthouse He also wanted to be a marine painter and attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts for a year, in 1838, taking C.W. Eckersberg as his mentor.Brief biography (in Danish). @ Den Store Danske. By 1840, he was already exhibiting some seascapes that attracted the attention of the German art collector, Karl Friedrich von Rumohr. On his recommendation, Melbye accompanied King Christian VIII on his corvette for a voyage through the Baltic and North Seas. Soon after, he was invited to accompany the King on a voyage to Morocco, where he witnessed the Bombardment of Tangiers. In 1845, he applied to the Royal Academy for a travel scholarship, but was passed over. With the support of the King, he was awarded the money in 1846 and his painting of the Eddystone Lighthouse was purchased for the Royal Collection. It also won the Thorvaldsen Medal. This brought a rush of orders that forced him to postpone his trip. Years in Paris He finally arrived in Paris in 1847 and remained through the Revolution; receiving a year's extension on his scholarship. His name soon became known in local articles circles and he remained there even longer. In 1853, he was given the chance to travel with a French expedition to Istanbul. For a time, he lived with the French Ambassador, Achille Baraguey d'Hilliers, and painted a portrait of Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I. During these years, he also received a commission from Napoleon III and learned how to take daguerrotypes directly from Louis Daguerre, just before his death. Danish Steam Frigate Jylland (1866) He was married in 1857 and returned to Denmark the following year. Upon his arrival, he was named a member of the Royal Academy and awarded the Order of the Dannebrog. In 1862, he became a Professor. During his later years, he divided his time between Copenhagen, Hamburg and Paris. Despite his great success, he was often frustrated that everyone he met referred to his picture of the lighthouse as his greatest painting. Worsening health gradually affected his ability to paint, so he turned to charcoal and chalk sketches. He died during a stay in Paris and was buried there. His paintings are realistic, often enhanced with dramatic light and weather effects (he was especially fond of portraying inclement weather), and show the influence of Camille Corot, who he met in Paris.

Indigenous) was a former Yugoslav rock band, notable as one of the pioneers of the former Yugoslav rock scene History 1963-1969 The band Samonikli was formed in 1963 by four Belgrade high school students. The band was named after a book of short stories by writer Pre≈æihov Voranc. Group members changed frequently in the early period, but by 1964 they stabilized in the following lineup: Marin Peƒçjak (vocals), Milan Pavlov (guitar), Marko Novakoviƒá (bass guitar), Bojan Drndiƒá (rhythm guitar) and Vuka≈°in Veljkoviƒá (drums). Initially the band performed at school proms and college dance parties. The band covered rock hits, as well as traditional songs and 1930s and 1940s schlagers, while their own songs were mostly The Shadows-inspired instrumentals. In 1965 and 1966 they played regularly at dances at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Technology and soon became widely popular. In 1966 they won first place at a country-wide youth festival of rock bands, which entitled them to represent their country at an international festival of youth orchestras in Hungary, which featured well- known Eastern European groups, such as Ill√©s, Metr√≥, Omega, and others, where they were viewed as a \\"western\\" group. The April 1966 issue of Belgrade youth magazine Susret wrote that Samonikli were the first \\"electric guitar band\\" in Belgrade to work with a group of violinists, preparing their subsequent two recordings, \\"Dozvoljavate li gospodine\\" and \\"Povetarac i ja\\", the latter of which became one of the top hits of 1966 on a popular Radio Belgrade II music program called Muziƒçki automat. At the end of 1966 they were joined by the drummer Branislav Grujiƒá. They were featured in a very popular series of shows on Belgrade Television called Koncert za ludi mladi svet (Concert for a Young and Crazy World). Their recordings were featured in many popular radio programs, including Nedeljom u devet i pet (Sunday at 9:05), produced and hosted by Nikola Karaklajiƒá. Towards the end of their career in 1967 and 1968, they covered many hits by The Jimi Hendrix Experience. They disbanded in early 1969 to pursue other professional interests. Reunions In December 1985, Samonikli reunited to play in Belgrade's Dom Sindikata Hall, along with many other popular sixties groups, at a commemorative concert marking the 25th anniversary of rock music in Belgrade. In 2003, marking their 40th anniversary, Samonikli held a dance concert for their friends and fans at the Duga Club in Belgrade, returning to their instrumental music. In 2005 and 2006 they held two dance concerts for several hundreds of fans in Belgrade's Park Restaurant. Recordings Although featured in radio and television shows, none of Samonikli recordings was ever officially released on vinyl record or any other format. *\\"Povetarac i ja\\" (Radio Belgrade) *\\"Dozvoljavate li gospodine\\" (Radio Belgrade) *\\"Usamljena gitara\\" (Radio Belgrade) *\\"Ne ustupam vam svoje mesto\\" (Radio Belgrade) *\\"Gde su ru≈æe nestale\\" (Radio Belgrade) *\\"Massachusetts\\" (Radio Belgrade) *\\"Mene moja nana\\" (Radio Belgrade) *\\"Izgubljena ljubav\\" (Radio Belgrade) *\\"Budi se Istok i Zapad\\" (Radio Belgrade) *\\"Heroj Tito\\" (Radio Belgrade) *\\"Napisao sam volim te u pesku\\" (TV Belgrade) *\\"Takav ƒçovek\\" (TV Belgrade) *\\"Da li vidi≈°\\" (TV Belgrade) References *D≈æuboks magazin, NIP Duga Beograd 1966. godine, br. 1, 3 maj 1966 *Susret, list omladine Beograda, broj 44, god.

The focal plane is located at 73 meters above sea level. The lighthouse has a range of 25 nautical miles (about 46 km), and is therefore defined as an offshore lighthouse. It is a 28 m (92 ft) octagonal masonry tower on a two-story house.

His best-remembered recordings are \\"We Told You Not to Marry\\" and \\"Sound-Off\\". He also wrote \\"Leave My Kitten Alone\\", \\"Sticks and Stones\\" and \\"Tell Me Why\\". Biography Turner was born in Atlanta, Georgia. His debut single, \\"Where Are You\\", was released in 1950 by Aladdin Records, credited to Mr. T and his Band. Another single, \\"Stop Trying to Make a Fool of Me\\", was released by Regal Records in 1951. A year later he recorded eight tracks for Okeh Records, including \\"Got So Much Trouble.\\" He then recorded for Wing, an imprint of Mercury Records, but he was not commercially successful until 1955, when Little Willie John recorded Turner's \\"All Around the World\\". Another version, retitled \\"Grits Ain't Groceries,\\" was by Little Milton. Turner and John then co-wrote \\"Leave My Kitten Alone\\", cover versions of which were recorded by Johnny Preston, the Beatles, and Elvis Costello. In 1959, King Records issued Turner's first hit single, \\"The Return of Stagolee,\\" an answer song to Lloyd Price's \\"Stagger Lee\\". He repeated the trick with his next release, \\"We Told You Not to Marry,\\" an answer to Price's \\"I'm Gonna Get Married.\\" In 1960, Ray Charles recorded Turner's song \\"Sticks and Stones\\", many cover versions of which have been issued over the years. By 1961 Turner had his biggest solo success with \\"Sound-Off\\", which came from the only album he ever released. The track was described by Joel Whitburn in Top Pop Singles 1955‚Äì2002 as a \\"popular US Army marching drill chant,\\" which had been a number 3 hit for Vaughn Monroe in 1951. Later singles failed to find a market, and Turner recorded for many labels throughout the 1960s without further tangible success. These included \\"Eye to Eye\\" (Okeh, 1966). His final release was a song he wrote, \\"His Funeral, My Trial\\", in 1969. Turner died in Atlanta in 1984.

Descendants of Joris Jansen Rapelje Joris Rapelje and Catalina Trico were married 21 January 1624, at the Walloon Church of Amsterdam. Rapelje, an illiterate 19-year-old textile worker whose origin was noted in the registry as 'Valencenne' (Valenciennes, Spanish Netherlands), and his 18-year-bride, had no family present to witness the ceremony. Four days later, on 25 January, the couple departed from Amsterdam, bound for North America.The Island at the Center of the World, Russell Shorto, Random House, p. 41 They were traveling aboard the first ships to bring immigrants and workers to New Netherland. The Rapalje family were first employed at Fort Orange, in what would eventually become Albany, New York. Fort Orange was being erected by the Dutch West India Company as a trading post on the west bank of the Hudson River. It became the company's official outpost in the upper Hudson Valley. The families aboard these ships were principally Walloons, French-speaking residents of Valenciennes, Roubaix, Hainaut and related sites, now in Belgium‚Äôs province of Wallonia and France's region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, but then part of the Spanish Netherlands.375th Anniversary of the Eendracht and Nieuw Nederland (The New York Genealogical and Biographical Society) By 1626, Dutch authorities had relocated most settlers from Fort Orange to Fort Amsterdam at the southern end of Manhattan Island. The Rapeljes established a residence near the East River, and were among the earliest purchasers of land in Manhattan, later building two houses on Pearl Street near the Fort. In 1637, Rapalje purchased about around Wallabout Bay in what is now Brooklyn. His son-in-law Hans Hansen Bergen acquired a large tract adjoining Rapelje's tract. Today the land where the Rapalje‚Äôs farm stood is the Brooklyn Navy Yard. In 1641, Rapalje was one of the Council of Twelve Men representing Manhattan, Breukelen and Pavonia. From 1655 through 1660, he was a magistrate of Brooklyn.

Drawing by Eliza Pratt Greatorex Rapelye Estate, 45th Street, North River Joris Jansen Rapelje and Catalina Trico were the parents of 11 children, including Sarah Rapelje, the first child of European parentage born in New Netherland. Sarah Rapelje's chair is in the collection of the Museum of the City of New York, and is thought to have been brought to New Netherland by the family. Their daughter Annetje married Martin Ryerson; they had many children including Cathalyntie who married Paulus Vanderbeek, Grandson of Master Paulus Vanderbeeck, a DWIC ship surgeon and Brooklyn's first resident doctor (who was also recorded in 1645 court records as having knocked Catalina Trico to the ground). Their daughter Jannetje married another Vanderbeek; Rem Jansen Vanderbeek, whose descendants took the name Remsen and who became a leading New York mercantile family.Prominent Families of New York, Nicoll & Roy Company, The Historical Company, 1897 Because of the number of their descendants, author Russell Shorto has called Joris Jansen and his wife Catalina \\"the Adam and Eve\\" of New Netherland as the number of their descendants has been estimated at about a million. Brooklyn's Rapelye Street is named for the family.

Examples   Factorial  A simple example that is often used to demonstrate the syntax of functional languages is the factorial function for non-negative integers, shown in Haskell: factorial :: Integer -> Integer factorial 0 = 1 factorial n = n * factorial (n-1) Or in one line: factorial n = if n > 1 then n * factorial (n-1) else 1 This describes the factorial as a recursive function, with one terminating base case. It is similar to the descriptions of factorials found in mathematics textbooks. Much of Haskell code is similar to standard mathematical notation in facility and syntax. The first line of the factorial function describes the type of this function; while it is optional, it is considered to be good styleHaskellWiki: Type signatures as good style to include it. It can be read as the function factorial (\`factorial\`) has type (\`::\`) from integer to integer (\`Integer -> Integer\`). That is, it takes an integer as an argument, and returns another integer. The type of a definition is inferred automatically if the programmer didn't supply a type annotation. The second line relies on pattern matching, an important feature of Haskell. Note that parameters of a function are not in parentheses but separated by spaces. When the function's argument is 0 (zero) it will return the integer 1 (one). For all other cases the third line is tried. This is the recursion, and executes the function again until the base case is reached. Using the \`product\` function from the Prelude, a number of small functions analogous to C's standard library, and using the Haskell syntax for arithmetic sequences, the factorial function can be expressed in Haskell as follows: factorial n = product [1..n] Here \`[1..n]\` denotes the arithmetic sequence in list form. Using the Prelude function \`enumFromTo\`, the expression \`[1..n]\` can be written as \`enumFromTo 1 n\`, allowing the factorial function to be expressed as factorial n = product (enumFromTo 1 n) which, using the function composition operator (expressed as a dot in Haskell) to compose the product function with the curried enumeration function can be rewritten in point-free style:HaskellWiki: Pointfree factorial = product . enumFromTo 1 In the Hugs interpreter, one often needs to define the function and use it on the same line separated by a \`where\` or \`let\`..\`in\`. For example, to test the above examples and see the output \`120\`: let { factorial n n > 0 = n * factorial (n-1); factorial _ = 1 } in factorial 5 or factorial 5 where factorial = product . enumFromTo 1 The GHCi interpreter doesn't have this restriction and function definitions can be entered on one line (with the \`let\` syntax without the \`in\` part), and referenced later.  More complex examples   Calculator  In the Haskell source immediately below, \\"::\\" can be read as \\"has type\\"; \\"a ‚Äî> b\\" can be read as \\"is a function from a to b\\". (Thus the Haskell \\"calc :: String ‚Äî> [Float]\\" can be read as \\"\`calc\` has type of function from Strings to lists of Floats\\".) In the second line \\"calc = ... \\" the equals sign can be read as \\"can be\\"; thus multiple lines with \\"calc = ... \\" can be read as multiple possible values for \`calc\`, depending on the circumstance detailed in each line. A simple Reverse Polish notation calculator expressed with the higher-order function \`foldl\` whose argument f is defined in a where clause using pattern matching and the type class Read: calc :: String -> [Float] calc = foldl f [] . words where f (x:y:zs) \\"+\\" = (y + x):zs f (x:y:zs) \\"-\\" = (y - x):zs f (x:y:zs) \\"*\\" = (y * x):zs f (x:y:zs) \\"/\\" = (y / x):zs f (x:y:zs) \\"FLIP\\" = y:x:zs f xs y = read y : xs The empty list is the initial state, and f interprets one word at a time, either as a function name, taking two numbers from the head of the list and pushing the result back in, or parsing the word as a floating-point number and prepending it to the list.  Fibonacci sequence  The following definition produces the list of Fibonacci numbers in linear time: fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs) The infinite list is produced by corecursion ‚Äî the latter values of the list are computed on demand starting from the initial two items 0 and 1. This kind of a definition relies on lazy evaluation, an important feature of Haskell programming. For an example of how the evaluation evolves, the following illustrates the values of fibs and tail fibs after the computation of six items and shows how zipWith (+) has produced four items and proceeds to produce the next item: fibs = 0 : 1 : 1 : 2 : 3 : 5 : ... \\\\+ + + + + + tail fibs = 1 : 1 : 2 : 3 : 5 : ... = = = = = = zipWith ... = 1 : 2 : 3 : 5 : 8 : ... fibs = 0 : 1 : 1 : 2 : 3 : 5 : 8 : ... The same function, written using GHC's parallel list comprehension syntax (GHC extensions must be enabled using a special command-line flag, here -XParallelListComp, or by starting the source file with \`{-# LANGUAGE ParallelListComp #-}\`): fibs = 0 : 1 : [ a+b a <\\\\- fibs b <\\\\- tail fibs ] or with regular list comprehensions: fibs = 0 : 1 : [ a+b (a,b) <\\\\- zip fibs (tail fibs) ] or directly self-referencing: fibs = 0 : 1 : next fibs where next (a : t@(b:_)) = (a+b) : next t With stateful generating function: fibs = next (0,1) where next (a,b) = a : next (b, a+b) or with \`unfoldr\`: fibs = unfoldr (\\\\\\\\(a,b) -> Just (a, (b, a+b))) (0, 1) or \`scanl\`: fibs = 0 : scanl (+) 1 fibs Using data recursion with Haskell's predefined fixpoint combinator: fibs = fix (\\\\xs -> 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) xs (tail xs)) -- zipWith version = fix ((0:) . (1:) . (zipWith (+) <*> tail)) -- same as above, pointfree = fix ((0:) . scanl (+) 1) -- scanl version  Factorial  The factorial we saw previously can be written as a sequence of functions: factorial n = foldr ((.) . (*)) id [1..n] $ 1 \\\\-- factorial 5  ((1*) .) ( ((2*) .) ( ((3*) .) ( ((4*) .) ( ((5*) .) id )))) 1 \\\\--  (1*) . (2*) . (3*) . (4*) . (5*) . id $ 1  More examples   Hamming numbers  A remarkably concise function that returns the list of Hamming numbers in order: hamming = 1 : map (2*) hamming \`union\` map (3*) hamming \`union\` map (5*) hamming Like the various \`fibs\` solutions displayed above, this uses corecursion to produce a list of numbers on demand, starting from the base case of 1 and building new items based on the preceding part of the list. Here the function \`union\` is used as an operator by enclosing it in back-quotes. Its \`case\` clauses define how it merges two ascending lists into one ascending list without duplicate items, representing sets as ordered lists. Its companion function \`minus\` implements set difference: { union (x:xs) (y:ys) = case compare x y of LT -> x : union xs (y:ys) EQ -> x : union xs ys GT -> y : union (x:xs) ys union xs [] = xs union [] ys = ys |minus (x:xs) (y:ys) = case compare x y of LT -> x : minus xs (y:ys) EQ -> minus xs ys GT -> minus (x:xs) ys minus xs _ = xs \\\\-- |} It is possible to generate only the unique multiples, for more efficient operation. Since there are no duplicates, there's no need to remove them: smooth235 = 1 : foldr (\\\\p s -> fix $ mergeBy (<) s . map (p*) . (1:)) [] [2,3,5] where fix f = x where x = f x -- fixpoint combinator, with sharing This uses the more efficient function \`merge\` which doesn't concern itself with the duplicates (also used in the following next function, \`mergesort\` ): mergeBy less xs ys = merge xs ys where merge xs [] = xs merge [] ys = ys merge (x:xs) (y:ys) less y x = y : merge (x:xs) ys otherwise = x : merge xs (y:ys) Each vertical bar ( \`|\` ) starts a guard clause with a guard expression before the \`=\` sign and the corresponding definition after it, that is evaluated if the guard is true.  Mergesort  Here is a bottom-up merge sort, defined using the higher- order function \`until\`: mergesortBy less [] = [] mergesortBy less xs = head $ until (null . tail) (pairwise $ mergeBy less) x] x <\\\\- xs] pairwise f (a:b:t) = f a b : pairwise f t pairwise f t = t  Prime numbers  The mathematical definition of primes can be translated pretty much word for word into Haskell: \\\\-- \\"Integers above 1 that cannot be divided by a smaller integer above 1\\" primes = [ n n <\\\\- [2..], all ((> 0) . rem n) [2..(n-1)] ] This finds primes by trial division. Note that it is not optimized for efficiency and has very poor performance. Slightly faster (but still very slow) is this code by David Turner: primes = sieve [2..] where sieve (p:xs) = p : sieve [x x <\\\\- xs, rem x p /= 0] Much faster is the optimal trial division algorithm primes = 2 : [ n n <\\\\- [3..], all ((> 0) . rem n) $ takeWhile ((<= n) .

It is quite slow.  Syntax   Layout  Haskell allows indentation to be used to indicate the beginning of a new declaration. For example, in a where clause: product xs = prod xs 1 where prod [] a = a prod (x:xs) a = prod xs (a*x) The two equations for the nested function \`prod\` are aligned vertically, which allows the semi-colon separator to be omitted. In Haskell, indentation can be used in several syntactic constructs, including \`do\`, \`let\`, \`case\`, \`class\`, and \`instance\`. The use of indentation to indicate program structure originates in Landin's ISWIM language, where it was called the off-side rule. This was later adopted by Miranda, and Haskell adopted a similar (but rather more complicated) version of Miranda's off-side rule, which is called \\"layout\\". Other languages to adopt whitespace-sensitive syntax include Python and F#. The use of layout in Haskell is optional. For example, the function \`product\` above can also be written: product xs = prod xs 1 where { prod [] a = a; prod (x:xs) a = prod xs (a*x) } The explicit open brace after the \`where\` keyword indicates that the programmer has opted to use explicit semi-colons to separate declarations, and that the declaration-list will be terminated by an explicit closing brace. One reason for wanting support for explicit delimiters is that it makes automatic generation of Haskell source code easier. Haskell's layout rule has been criticised for its complexity. In particular, the definition states that if the parser encounters a parse error during processing of a layout section, then it should try inserting a close brace (the \\"parse error\\" rule). Implementing this rule in a traditional parsing/lexical-analysis combination requires two-way cooperation between the parser and lexical analyser, whereas in most languages these two phases can be considered independently.  Function calls  Applying a function \`f\` to a value \`x\` is expressed as simply \`f x\`. Haskell distinguishes function calls from infix operators syntactically, but not semantically. Function names which are composed of punctuation characters can be used as operators, as can other function names if surrounded with backticks; and operators can be used in prefix notation if surrounded with parentheses. This example shows the ways that functions can be called: add a b = a + b ten1 = 5 + 5 ten2 = (+) 5 5 ten3 = add 5 5 ten4 = 5 \`add\` 5 Functions which are defined as taking several parameters can always be partially applied. Binary operators can be partially applied using section notation: ten5 = (+ 5) 5 ten6 = (5 +) 5 addfive = (5 +) ten7 = addfive 5  List comprehensions  See List comprehension#Overview for the Haskell example.  Pattern matching  Pattern matching is used to match on the different constructors of algebraic data types. Here are some functions, each using pattern matching on each of the types below: \\\\-- This type signature says that empty takes a list containing any type, and returns a Bool empty :: [a] -> Bool empty (x:xs) = False empty [] = True \\\\-- Will return a value from a Maybe a, given a default value in case a Nothing is encountered fromMaybe :: a -> Maybe a -> a fromMaybe x (Just y) = y fromMaybe x Nothing = x isRight :: Either a b -> Bool isRight (Right _) = True isRight (Left _) = False getName :: Person -> String getName (Person name _ _) = name getSex :: Person -> Sex getSex (Person _ sex _) = sex getAge :: Person -> Int getAge (Person _ _ age) = age Using the above functions, along with the \`map\` function, we can apply them to each element of a list, to see their results: map empty 1,2,3,[],[2],1.. \\\\-- returns [False,True,False,False] map (fromMaybe 0) [Just 2,Nothing,Just 109238, Nothing] \\\\-- returns [2,0,109238,0] map isRight [Left \\"hello\\", Right 6, Right 23, Left \\"world\\"] \\\\-- returns [False, True, True, False] map getName [Person \\"Sarah\\" Female 20, Person \\"Alex\\" Male 20, tom] \\\\-- returns [\\"Sarah\\", \\"Alex\\", \\"Tom\\"], using the definition for tom above * Abstract Types * Lists  Tuples  Tuples in haskell can be used to hold a fixed number of elements. They are used to group pieces of data of differing types: account :: (String, Integer, Double) -- The type of a three-tuple, representing \\\\-- a name, balance, and interest rate account = (\\"John Smith\\",102894,5.25) Tuples are commonly used in the zip* functions to place adjacent elements in separate lists together in tuples (zip4 to zip7 are provided in the Data.List module): \\\\-- The definition of the zip function. Other zip* functions are defined similarly zip :: [x] -> [y] -> [(x,y)] zip (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y) : zip xs ys zip _ _ = [] zip [1..5] \\"hello\\" \\\\-- returns [(1,'h'),(2,'e'),(3,'l'),(4,'l'),(5,'o')] \\\\-- and has type [(Integer, Char)] zip3 [1..5] \\"hello\\" [False, True, False, False, True] \\\\-- returns [(1,'h',False),(2,'e',True),(3,'l',False),(4,'l',False),(5,'o',True)] \\\\-- and has type [(Integer,Char,Bool)] In the GHC compiler, tuples are defined with sizes from 2 elements up to 62 elements. * Records  Namespaces  In the #More_complex_examples section above, \`calc\` is used in two senses, showing that there is a Haskell type class namespace and also a namespace for values: #a Haskell type class for \`calc\`. The domain and range can be explicitly denoted in a Haskell type class. #a Haskell value, formula, or expression for \`calc\`.  Typeclasses and polymorphism   Algebraic data types  Algebraic data types are used extensively in Haskell. Some examples of these are the built in list, \`Maybe\` and \`Either\` types: \\\\-- A list of a's ([a]) is either an a consed (:) onto another list of a's, or an empty list ([]) data [a] = a : [a] [] \\\\-- Something of type Maybe a is either Just something, or Nothing data Maybe a = Just a Nothing \\\\-- Something of type Either atype btype is either a Left atype, or a Right btype data Either a b = Left a Right b Users of the language can also define their own abstract data types. An example of an ADT used to represent a person's name, sex and age might look like: data Sex = Male Female data Person = Person String Sex Int -- Notice that Person is both a constructor and a type \\\\-- An example of creating something of type Person tom :: Person tom = Person \\"Tom\\" Male 27  Type system  * Type classes * Type defaulting * Overloaded Literals * Higher Kinded Polymorphism * Multi-Parameter Type Classes * Functional Dependencies  Monads and input/output  * Overview of the monad framework * Applications ** Monadic IO ** Do-notation ** References ** Exceptions  ST monad  The ST monad allows programmers to write imperative algorithms in Haskell, using mutable variables (STRef's) and mutable arrays (STArrays and STUArrays). The advantage of the ST monad is that it allows programmers to write code that has internal side effects, such as destructively updating mutable variables and arrays, while containing these effects inside the monad. The result of this is that functions written using the ST monad appear completely pure to the rest of the program. This allows programmers to produce imperative code where it may be impractical to write functional code, while still keeping all the safety that pure code provides. Here is an example program (taken from the Haskell wiki page on the ST monad) that takes a list of numbers, and sums them, using a mutable variable: import Control.Monad.ST import Data.STRef import Control.Monad sumST :: Num a => [a] -> a sumST xs = runST $ do -- runST takes stateful ST code and makes it pure. summed <\\\\- newSTRef 0 -- Create an STRef (a mutable variable) forM_ xs $ \\\\x -> do -- For each element of the argument list xs .. modifySTRef summed (+x) -- add it to what we have in n. readSTRef summed -- read the value of n, which will be returned by the runST above.  STM monad  The STM monad is an implementation of Software Transactional Memory in Haskell. It is implemented in the GHC compiler, and allows for mutable variables to be modified in transactions.  Arrows  * Applicative Functors * Arrows As Haskell is a pure functional language, functions cannot have side effects. Being non-strict, it also does not have a well-defined evaluation order. This is a challenge for real programs, which among other things need to interact with an environment. Haskell solves this with monadic types that leverage the type system to ensure the proper sequencing of imperative constructs. The typical example is I/O, but monads are useful for many other purposes, including mutable state, concurrency and transactional memory, exception handling, and error propagation. Haskell provides a special syntax for monadic expressions, so that side-effecting programs can be written in a style similar to current imperative programming languages; no knowledge of the mathematics behind monadic I/O is required for this. The following program reads a name from the command line and outputs a greeting message: main = do putStrLn \\"What's your name?\\" name <\\\\- getLine putStr (\\"Hello, \\" ++ name ++ \\"! \\") The do-notation eases working with monads. This do-expression is equivalent to, but (arguably) easier to write and understand than, the de-sugared version employing the monadic operators directly: main = putStrLn \\"What's your name?\\" >> getLine >>= \\\\ name -> putStr (\\"Hello, \\" ++ name ++ \\"! \\") : See also wikibooks:Transwiki:List of hello world programs#Haskell for another example that prints text.  Concurrency  The Haskell language definition itself does not include either concurrency or parallelism, although GHC supports both. Concurrent Haskell is an extension to Haskell that provides support for threads and synchronization.Simon Peyton Jones, Andrew Gordon, and Sigbjorn Finne. Concurrent Haskell. ACM SIGPLAN- SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (PoPL). 1996. (Some sections are out of date with respect to the current implementation.) GHC's implementation of Concurrent Haskell is based on multiplexing lightweight Haskell threads onto a few heavyweight OS threads,Runtime Support for Multicore Haskell (Simon Marlow, Simon Peyton Jones, Satnam Singh) ICFP '09: Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGPLAN international conference on Functional programming, Edinburgh, Scotland, August 2009 so that Concurrent Haskell programs run in parallel on a multiprocessor. The runtime can support millions of simultaneous threads. The GHC implementation employs a dynamic pool of OS threads, allowing a Haskell thread to make a blocking system call without blocking other running Haskell threads.Extending the Haskell Foreign Function Interface with Concurrency (Simon Marlow, Simon Peyton Jones, Wolfgang Thaller) Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN workshop on Haskell, pages 57--68, Snowbird, Utah, USA, September 2004 Hence the lightweight Haskell threads have the characteristics of heavyweight OS threads, and the programmer is unaware of the implementation details. Recently, Concurrent Haskell has been extended with support for Software Transactional Memory (STM), which is a concurrency abstraction in which compound operations on shared data are performed atomically, as transactions. GHC's STM implementation is the only STM implementation to date to provide a static compile-time guarantee preventing non-transactional operations from being performed within a transaction. The Haskell STM library also provides two operations not found in other STMs: \`retry\` and \`orElse\`, which together allow blocking operations to be defined in a modular and composable fashion.

Career Nocando began gaining notoriety in Leimert Park's open-mic workshops in South Los Angeles. In the battle circuit, it is believed that he has won a hundred wins over many emcees. He has since focused on making and releasing music, only taking time out occasionally to battle. In 2010, Nocando released his official debut album, Jimmy the Lock, on Alpha Pup Records. It was produced by Thavius Beck, Nosaj Thing, Free the Robots, Daedelus, and Nicholas Thorburn, among others. In that year, he also released Sincerely Yours, a collaborative EP with Nobody as Bomb Zombies, on Hellfyre Club. In 2011, he released 10 Haters, a collaborative album with Busdriver as Flash Bang Grenada. Alarm included it on the \\"50 Unheralded Albums from 2011\\" list. In 2012, Nocando released a free EP, Zero Hour, as well as the singles \\"Where's the Money?\\" and \\"Up in the Air\\". In 2013, he released a single, \\"Little Green Monsters\\". His second solo album, Jimmy the Burnout, was released on Hellfyre Club in 2014. In 2017, Nocando released Severed. HipHopDX called it \\"one of Nocando's most powerful albums to date.\\" Uproxx named it the 24th best rap album of 2017. In that year, he also released King Snake. In 2019, Nocando changed his stage name to All City Jimmy, and later removed all Nocando titles from digital retailers.

The PRR, for unknown reasons, rejected 33 of 38 locomotives in the order. The United States Railroad Administration reassigned 23 of them (road numbers 4000-4007 and 4017-4031) to the St. Louis‚ÄìSan Francisco Railway (SLSF), also known as the \\"Frisco\\". The Frisco also received 10 sisters from the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad (road numbers 4008-4016 and 4032), making 33 in all. She is now on display at the Fort Smith Trolley Museum in Fort Smith, Arkansas. The USRA Designs The railroads of the United States were nationalized during World War I, from December, 1917 to March, 1920. As part of this, locomotives built during the period were one of the twelve USRA standard designs, which included the Light Mikado. 4003 was one of 625 built by the USRA; another 641 were built after the USRA era, making it one of the most numerous single locomotive designs of all time. After Frisco received the Mikados, it modified them with boosters on the trailing trucks and raised cab roofs for more headroom. 4003 4003 was one of three of the class built by ALCO at its Schenectady Locomotive Works in late summer 1919. The balance of the class was built by Lima. It cost $53,619. The Frisco put it into service hauling freight between Fort Smith, Arkansas and Monett, Missouri, which included a stretch through the Boston Mountains that was relatively steep. Two major sources of carloads were berries, a million quarts shipped in 1941, and zinc, which was smelted in Fort Smith. Like all the other US railroads, the Frisco actively began converting to diesel power in the late forties. 4003 was retired in early 1952, shortly before the last steam powered train on the Frisco, between Birmingham and Bessemer, Alabama in February. Frisco kept the locomotive until 1954 when it donated it to the City of Fort Smith. The city placed it on display in Kay Rodgers Park where it remained for almost 50 years. Early in this century, the city transferred the locomotive to the Fort Smith Trolley Museum with the provision that the museum pay for the moving. It now sits outside at the museum. While it could probably be restored to operating condition, the museum has no track on which to run it and the restoration cost would be considerable. The locomotive was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004 as St. Louis San Francisco (Frisco) Railway Steam Locomotive #4003.

He took up the post in a context where Fiji's long-standing tradition of providing peace-keeping forces to the United Nations was facing opposition from New Zealand and Australia due to the 2006 military coup in Fiji. A few months before his appointment, Thomson had publicly criticised what he described as Australia's \\"ongoing campaign to choke off Fiji‚Äôs role as an international peacekeeper\\". In 2011, the United Nations requested Fiji to increase its deployment of peacekeepers in Iraq. In 2013, a battalion of Fijian peacekeepers was deployed to UNDOF (Golan, Syria). As Fiji's Representative to the United Nations, he strove to broaden Fiji's diplomatic relations as widely as possible, so that during his time at the United Nations, Fiji formalised diplomatic relations with over ninety countries. He has been described as \\"spearheading vital elements of Fiji's Look North policy.\\" Graham Davis wrote that Ambassador Thomson had \\"forged a new network of international relationships for Fiji ‚Ä¶ including membership of the Non- Aligned Movement\\", and that he has been a prime mover in developing the influence at the UN of the Pacific Small Island Developing States. In line with these efforts, Ambassador Thomson led a successful campaign to change the UN regional group's name from \\"the Asian Group\\" to the \\"Asia-Pacific Group\\", culminating in the formal name-change in September 2011. In 2011 in Kingston, Jamaica, he was elected as President of the Assembly of the 17th session of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), and in 2015 was elected as President of the ISA's Council. In 2011‚Äì12, he served as a Vice-President of the 66th session of the UN General Assembly in New York. In 2012, he successfully led the campaign for Fiji's election to Chairmanship of the Group of 77 and China, the UN's largest negotiating bloc of 133 developing countries, and served in that capacity throughout 2013. In January 2014, Fiji was elected to the Presidency of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS). In his capacity as Fiji's Permanent Representative, Ambassador Thomson undertook the UNDP Presidency role, with Executive Board oversight responsibilities for over US$7 billion of UN annual funding. During the intergovernmental negotiations at the United Nations between 2013 and 2015 leading to the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Ambassador Thomson was an influential spokesperson on behalf of developing countries. As part of the Pacific Small Island Developing States group, he was particularly forceful in the creation of SDG14, the Ocean Goal, that sets out to conserve and sustainably use the Ocean's resources. On 13 June 2016, Peter Thomson was elected as the 71st President of the United Nations General Assembly. He thereby became the first person from the Pacific Islands region to fill the top post of the United Nations,Fijian diplomat elected president of U.N. General Assembly, Reuters, 13 June 2016 serving in that capacity from September 2016 to September 2017.

In support of the implementation of SDG14, President Thomson organised the first UN Ocean Conference. Held at the UN campus in June 2017, it was co-hosted by Fiji and Sweden, and is widely regarded as the turning point in global action to reverse the decline in the Ocean's health.

Grant's Army of the Tennessee and Rear Admiral David D. Porter's Mississippi River Squadron in the Vicksburg campaign of the American Civil War. Grant's objective was to get his troops into a flanking position against the Rebel defenders. The expedition was an effort to bypass the Confederate defenses on the bluffs near the city by using the backwaters of the Mississippi Delta as a route from the Mississippi River to the Yazoo River. Once on the Yazoo, the Army would be able to cross the river unopposed and thus achieve their goal. The operation would require a deep penetration into enemy territory that was dominated by water, so cooperation between the two services was necessary. The Army was led by Brigadier General Leonard F. Ross. Naval commander was Lieutenant Commander Watson Smith, who was in extremely poor health; his health was an important factor in the ultimate failure of the expedition. The expedition began on February 3, 1863 with the breaching of a levee on the Mississippi River, allowing water to flow from the river into a former channel that connected with the Yazoo River through a series of other waterways. The attacking fleet passed through the cut into Moon Lake, through the Yazoo Pass to the Coldwater River, and then into the Tallahatchie, which combines with the Yalobusha to form the Yazoo River, which met the Mississippi a short distance above Vicksburg. From the start, the expedition was delayed by natural obstacles that were more serious than the perfunctory Confederate resistance, so forward motion was as little as a day. Because progress was so slow, the Confederate Army under Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton was able to set up a fort and block passage of the Federal fleet near the town of Greenwood, Mississippi. The Federal fleet did not approach the fort until March 11; then, the ironclad gunboats of the fleet were repulsed in a series of gunfire exchanges on three separate days. Because of the nature of the ground, much of which was under water, the Army troops present could not contribute significantly to the battle. Following the third repulse on March 16, Lieutenant Commander Smith's health failed him completely, and he turned command over to Lieutenant Commander James P. Foster. Foster and Ross decided to withdraw to the Mississippi. They were temporarily persuaded to try again when they met reinforcements for the Army, but they resumed their retreat when the new army commander, Brigadier General Isaac F. Quinby, saw the futility of further attacks. The entire force had returned by April 12, and the expedition was over. Background The Vicksburg campaign was bogged down in early 1863, following the repulse of the Union forces under Brigadier General William T. Sherman at Walnut Hills (or Chickasaw Bayou) late the previous year. Major General Ulysses S. Grant wanted to keep his troops busy until he could begin active campaigning later in the spring, so he ordered them to undertake several moves that would give the appearance of activity but would not bring on a major battle. Grant, writing in his memoirs long after the event, stated that he did not have great confidence that any of them would prove successful, although he was prepared to take advantage of them if they did.Grant, Memoirs, p. 297. One of the operations he put in motion became known as the Yazoo Pass expedition because it used a waterway of that name. Geography The western part of the state of Mississippi, from the Tennessee state line to the north and Vicksburg at the south, is a part of the flood plain of the Mississippi River. As such, it is quite low; in many places, it is in fact lower than the level of the river. The region is therefore occupied by numerous marshes, brakes, sloughs, bayous, lakes, creeks, and rivers that in the geologic past were parts of the river bed. Until the middle of the nineteenth century, overflow from the Mississippi continued to pass into these waters, and they could be used as alternatives to the main river for water transportation. One such route left the Mississippi at a point a little south of Helena, Arkansas, passed through Moon Lake (an oxbow lake, i.e. a former loop of the river that had been cut off when it changed course), and followed the Yazoo Pass to the Coldwater River. The Coldwater is a tributary of the Tallahatchie River, which combines with the Yalobusha to form the Yazoo River at Greenwood, Mississippi. The Yazoo then flows , to reenter the Mississippi a short distance above Vicksburg. This changed in 1856, however, when the coming of the railroad induced the state to drain some of the land for agricultural uses. To that end, they built artificial levees to confine the river to its main course. Deprived of its principal source, the water level behind the levee dropped as much as eight feet (approximately 2.5 m).Shea and Winschel, Vicksburg Is the Key, pp. 68-69\\\\. ORN ser. I, v. 24, p. 258 states that the date of building the levee was 1853. Preliminaries 1865 descriptive map The Army and Navy had distinct but not incompatible reasons to get their forces to the east of Vicksburg. Grant wanted to get his soldiers onto dry ground with no rivers between him and the Confederate defense. Once that was done, he believed that he could flank Pemberton's Confederate army. At the same time, he could divert a part of the expedition up the Yalobusha River to destroy a railroad bridge that was enabling the enemy to threaten his own line of communications. Porter's purpose was to use his armored gunboats to destroy Rebel shipping at Yazoo City. He emphasized that any enemy ironclads must be destroyed, if possible on the stocks. Although the two services had divergent goals, this did not affect the expedition adversely; its ultimate failure is ascribed to other causes.Hearn, Admiral Porter, p. 179. See also Porter's orders to Watson Smith, ORN ser. I, v. 24, p. 244. A preliminary survey by Acting Master George W. Brown in the tinclad confirmed the feasibility of the operation, and on February 3, 1863 a group of some 400 pioneers under Lieutenant Colonel James H. Wilson dug two gaps in the levee at the site where the Old Yazoo Pass had formerly met the Mississippi. At this time, the difference in water level between the river and the former stream bed was , so the water rushed through the openings with great vigor, enlarging the gap and carrying away everything in its path. By the next day, the gap had increased in size to . The flow was so great that the vessels assigned to the expedition could not safely enter for several days. The flotilla of gunboats and army transports passed through the gap on February 24 and immediately proceeded into Moon Lake.Hearn, Admiral Porter, pp. 179-182\\\\. Shea and Winschel, Vicksburg Is the Key, p. 69. Advance and Confederate response left|thumb|Map of the path of the Yazoo Pass expedition from the Mississippi River to the Coldwater River, prepared by Lt. Col. James H. Wilson (Corps of Engineers).|alt=Map of the waterways covered in the early part of the expedition. Beginning at the Yazoo Cut on the Mississippi just below Helena, Arkansas, it passes through Moon Lake, then along the Yazoo Pass to the Coldwater River. The naval contingent consisted of seven gunboats and a tug. Five of the gunboats were of a type known colloquially as \\"tinclads,\\" vessels of light draft carrying thin armor capable of protection only against infantry weapons: , , , , and . The other two were the larger and heavier , one of the original City class ironclads, and , an inferior second-generation copy. Later, another gunboat, , and two rams, USS Lioness and USS Dick Fulton, would join the expedition. Lieutenant Commander Watson Smith led the flotilla from his flagship Rattler.Joiner, Mr. Lincoln's Brown Water Navy, p. 125. ORN ser. I, v. 24, p. 245. The Army contributed nine infantry regiments that were carried in thirteen transports. An additional 600 or so soldiers were sent aboard the tinclads to defend them, if necessary, from Rebel boarding parties that could be expected in an operation so deep in enemy territory. Grant would have sent more troops, but a shortage of available transports prevented him from doing so. The troops were a part of the XIII Corps, under the command of Brigadier General Leonard F. Ross. Later, they would be reinforced by a column led by Brigadier General Isaac F. Quinby, who ranked Ross.Hearn, Admiral Porter, pp. 182, 184. The Confederates in the meantime were not idle. Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton was aware of his opponents' intent as soon as the levee had been breached, if not before, and he gave orders to Major General William W. Loring to stop them. He immediately organized some work details to block the Yazoo Pass and Coldwater River by felling trees across the streams, but they were largely ineffective. The obstructions were quickly removed by Union army engineers under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Wilson. More serious, however, was a fort that Loring ordered to be built a few miles upstream from the point where the Tallahatchie and Yalobusha Rivers combine to form the Yazoo. A peculiarity of the courses of the Tallahatchie and the Yazoo is that they flow past each other on opposite sides of a neck of land that is only a couple of hundred yards (or meters) wide.At present, a part of the Tallahatchie flows through a crossover channel near the former site of Fort Pemberton, thus in effect making the land opposite the city of Greenwood an island. The crossover did not exist in 1863. Here, Loring's men made a barricade of cotton bales, covered them with layers of dirt, and mounted a pair of heavy guns. This hastily constructed earthwork was named \\"Fort Pemberton,\\" or sometimes \\"Fort Greenwood.\\" He had other batteries lining the bank of the Tallahatchie almost all the way to the Yalobusha, and still others on the Yazoo. In addition, he had built a boom or raft that could be swung out to block the stream, and in the channel just downstream of this he scuttled a ship, the former Star of the West.Star of the West was famed for her role in the first attempt to resupply Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor in the final days of the Buchanan presidency. She turned back in the face of secessionist gunfire (this was before the Confederacy was established), and the Civil War was postponed for another two months. Later, on April 17, 1861, she had been captured off the coast of Texas and taken into Confederate service. Her name was changed officially at that time to Saint Philip, but almost everyone continued to refer to her by her former name. See Tucker, Blue and Gray Navies, p. 228. Loring had time to set up the defense because the progress of the Union flotilla was painfully slow. Instead of pushing ahead with his ironclads, Lieutenant Commander Smith insisted that the entire force, gunboats and transports alike, should move together. They could move only in daylight hours, but Smith continued to recoal his vessels during the day. Furthermore, they would waste hours in the early mornings and would stop at midday for lunch. Moving faster than the current, according to Smith, \\"brings us foul.\\"ORN I, v. 24, p. 262. Ross protested strongly against the lack of urgency, as did Smith's second in command, Lieutenant Commander James P. Foster. Their pleas were disregarded. Smith's torpor may have been a result of his declining health; he had been sick when the expedition started, but he had stayed on, hoping that he would improve when his fleet was in motion. Instead, he only got worse, and he eventually had to relinquish command to Foster. By then, however, it was too late.Smith's health was indeed failing, and he was sent North for medical treatment as soon as the expedition returned to the Mississippi, but he died soon after. See Soley, \\"Naval Operations,\\" Battles and Leaders, v. 3, pp. 561-563. Clash at Fort Pemberton alt=Site of the encounter near Greenwood, Mississippi. The Tallahatchie flows from the north in a tortuous path; near its lower end it is flowing almost due east, to the point where it meets the Yalobusha. The two rivers form the Yazoo, which soon turns west and flows past the Tallahatchie about three miles (5 kilometers) downstream. Fort Pemberton is set up at the point where the two rivers are closest. Other Confederate works line the right (south) bank of the Tallahatchie. The Union fleet is arrayed in the Tallahatchie upstream from Fort Pemberton, the ironclads in front about a half mile (700 meters) away. The Union flotilla finally arrived in the vicinity of Fort Pemberton on March 11, more than five weeks after the levee at Yazoo Cut had been breached. A probe sent out by the Army, accompanied by Chillicothe, found that the terrain near the fort was too marshy to support an attack by infantry. The attack would have to be carried out by the gunboats, aided by whatever artillery could be brought ashore and brought to bear. Not even all of the gunboats could participate; because the river was rather narrow, only two boats could engage at a time, and these only bows on to the enemy.This was at any rate in keeping with Porter's orders to Smith, which told the latter not to use the tinclads against Confederate artillery. ORN ser. I, v. 24, p. 244. The initial probe was followed by a more determined bombardment by Chillicothe and Baron De Kalb. In this action, Chillicothe sustained the most serious injury of the operation. A shell from Fort Pemberton passed through one of her gun ports while the gun was being loaded, striking the shell and causing both to explode. The gun itself was not harmed, but 14 members of the gun crew were killed or wounded. Another man was killed by a later hit. Baron De Kalb did not suffer any significant damage, because of her superior construction and because the Confederate gun crews concentrated their fire on the more vulnerable Chillicothe.Hearn, Admiral Porter, p. 183. ORN I, ser. I, v. 24, pp. 246-247. The next day (March 12) was given over to repairing the damage suffered by the gunboats, and giving them additional protection by placing cotton bales on the foredecks. Smith also landed a pair of 30-pounder Parrott guns, one from his flagship Rattler and the other from Forest Rose. He also sent ashore a 12-pounder howitzer. They were sited some from the fort, and were, like the guns in the fort, shielded by cotton bales covered with dirt.ORN I, ser. I, v. 24, p. 247. Hearn, Admiral Porter, p. 183. The two ironclads returned to action on March 13, this time assisted by the shore battery and the mortar boat. The Confederate gunners again concentrated their fire on Chillicothe. Although she lost only three wounded among her crew, the pounding she took from the enemy artillery loosened many of her armor plates and generally revealed the inadequacy of her construction. Baron De Kalb, although not punished so severely, lost three of her officers and men killed and three others wounded. The Rebels lost some of their men also, when a shell entered a magazine. Although it did not explode, its fuze set fire to the ammunition stored there, and the fire killed one man and burned 15 others. Another shell killed a man and wounded two others. At the end of the day, Fort Pemberton was basically unscathed; the gunboats, however, particularly Chillicothe, had been badly battered. Smith failed to note that the Confederate fire was slackening at the end of the day, their ammunition supply being depleted.Hearn, Admiral Porter, pp. 183-184. Smith spent the next two days repairing his vessels and landing a broadside gun taken from Baron De Kalb. He and Ross decided to make a determined assault on Monday, March 16. The ironclads would be pushed closer to Fort Pemberton than before in order to be better able to silence its guns. They would advance side by side with the mortar boat lashed between them. Infantry would follow in tinclads behind them, ready to go ashore as soon as the guns in the fort were knocked out and a suitable landing place could be found. The planned attack collapsed almost immediately when a series of shot or shell hit Chillicothe's casemate. The impact buckled the armor plates in such a manner that the gun port stoppers could not be raised. Chillicothe was forced to retire, and Smith decided to pull the relatively undamaged Baron De Kalb out of action also. That was essentially the end of the Union effort. Smith finally realized that his health was impeding the expedition, so he turned command over to his second- in-command, Lieutenant Commander James P. Foster.Hearn, Admiral Porter, p. 184. Milligan, Gunboats Down the Mississippi, p. 135. Foster and Ross decided together that further effort would be futile, so the flotilla began to withdraw the next day. They had not gone far when they encountered a group of Union transports bringing in reinforcements under the command of Brigadier General Isaac F. Quinby, whose appointment predated that of Ross and who therefore ranked him. Quinby ordered Ross to go back down the river to renew the attack, and he persuaded Foster (whom he could not order) to accompany him. A few desultory probes were launched in the next several days, but Quinby found what Ross already knew, that the land was unsuitable for an infantry assault. Quinby received orders from Grant to return to the Mississippi, where he and Ross were needed for the next assault on Vicksburg. The flotilla withdrew from Fort Pemberton for the last time, and by April 14 all had returned.Milligan, Gunboats Down the Mississippi, p. 136.

Family Fauconnier was born at the Villa Musset Barbezieux (Charente), the son of Charles, a brandy dealer who operated on his property near Cru Chevanceaux, and Melanie. Melanie Fauconnier lived in Limoges, where she was the best friend of Anna Haviland of Haviland porcelain. Haviland had arranged the 1874 marriage between the pair after she had married George Boutelleau, Barbezilien poet, playwright and novelist. (His family produced and promoted brandy butter Charente.) Fauconnier was the third of six children. His siblings included Genevieve Fauconnier (1886‚Äì1969), herself an award-winning writer who received the Prix Femina in 1933. He later sired his own son, Bernard. Biography In Barbezieux In a cultured, artistic Catholic family of six children, Fauconnier lived very freely with his siblings, cousins and friends in the garden and cellars of Musset. His friend Jacques Boutelleau (who would later be known under the pen name Jacques Chardonne following the publication of The Epithalame in 1921) came every day. They published a newspaper, and dramas were played on the castle square with text and music written by Fauconnier. In 1901, Fauconnier's father died following a long illness, and Fauconnier left Bordeaux for England, where he taught French music for two years in the small college of Wells House. There, a journal article drew his attention, suggesting there was a fortune to make in Borneo by planting sago. The idea took shape: if he wanted to write, he must first become a man of leisure. The easiest way to become a man of leisure would be to first make a fortune. Malaysia He left Marseille on 10 March 1905. On a stopover in Singapore, a month later, he decided to leave for the Borneo rubber plantations of Malaysia, which seemed more promising. He got an internship at his expense to a planter Klang near Kuala Lumpur so that he could learn the craft and the two essential languages, Malay and Tamil. In August, he discovered the location where he would eventually open his own plantation, in fertile land located on the distant hills beyond the Selangor River. He obtained a grant of and settled in Rantau Panjang in early 1906, when he built his first \\"Maison des Palmes\\". He loved all people, places, landscapes, hard work, the climate, life and 'la vie'. His mother mobilizes funds for this rich uncle to \\"give\\" her younger sisters. Thanks to these 20,000 francs, and the funds that his friend Jacques puts into his business, he was able to begin planting. In 1908, he founded at Brussels the \\"Plantation Fauconnier & Posth\\", with the assistance of the banker Adrian Hallet. He converted all he had in stocks and founder shares. Some friends joined the Charente to help expand its plantations. His grew wealthy with a doubling in the price of rubber in two years and the tripling of the value of its shares in the single year 1910. He was then chief of the Hallet plantation group, in the Far East (Sumatra, Java, Indochina and Malaysia). In 1911, on an idea of Hallet, he sent a few bags of seeds of palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) from Sumatra to Malaysia which would grow into the vast plantations of Malaysia. He established Tennamaram near Rantau Panjang, the first plantation of palm oil from Malaysia. After several visits to Malaysia, his family joined him there to settle. But, he felt that a page in his life had turned: material success was assured, and it had only been a means to an end. Keeping an eye on the plantation, he arranged to delegate his powers so that he might finally devote himself to writing. World War I and marriage But nobody expected World War I. Fauconnier married Madeleine Meslier, the sister of a planter who was a childhood friend of Barbezieux, but refused the French Consul's request that he remain where he was to ensure the continued production of rubber. Instead, he enlisted with the other French men at the plantation. After a few months in a depot of P√©rigueux (a place of prevailing squalor, stupidity, and military negligence), he arrived where he would remain as second class in most major battles except for two periods: first, for training officer school at Mourmelon-le-Grand in late 1916, and, second, for leave in Malaysia after his marriage in Charente in March 1917. From there he left for a few months to Indochina with the Annamese sharpshooters to attend Auguste Chevallier. In autumn 1917, he was reclaimed by France as an interpreter for the British army. He left his wife in Saigon, pregnant and sick. (When she returned with her daughter in April 1918, the ship which carried them in the Mediterranean was torpedoed.) Throughout the war, he cursed the Europeans and dreamed of being in Malaysia. The letters he wrote his wife in this period were published in 1998 as Letters to Madeleine, 1914-1918. In Tunisia After he was discharged, he left his wife in Switzerland, near Chardonne, as she was threatened with tuberculosis. Then he left to return to the plantations, which needed his help to expand Hallet. Through 1928, he made several inspection trips to Malaysia and Indochina, bound first by a long rubber crisis. Then, to ensure a more stable income, he accepted a position as director of several companies of tropical plantations. Liking neither the city of Paris nor the climate of France, he settled in Rades, near Tunis, in 1925. This was, for him, a compromise of remoteness and climate between Malaysia and the Charente. He occupied \\"The Terrace\\", a large low house in Arabic style surrounded by a huge garden. Malaisie and the Prix Goncourt In 1931, Jean Paulhan offered to publish Fauconnier's book on Malaysia, enthusiastic about the chapter Fauconnier had displayed. Malaisie, published by Stock, proved very popular and highly respected. But the celebrity that attended on its publication and his winning of the Prix Goncourt did not change Fauconnier. He kept to his usual practices. Being a writer, was not a priority for him; he saw himself as a \\"man of letters\\", and his letters show all his correspondent qualities. But he did enjoy his correspondences with other writers, including John Amrouche, Georges Bernanos, Henri Bosco, Jean Cocteau, Colette, Lucie Delarue-Mardrus, Alfred Fabre-Luce, Paul G√©raldy, Andr√© Gide, Jean Giono, Jean Gu√©henno, A. Guibert, Henri de Keyserling, Roger Martin du Gard, Maurice Maeterlinck, Jean Paulhan, Romain Rolland, Jean Schlumberger, and Robert Stiller. Fauconnier was not the only successful writer in his family; in 1933, the Prix Femina was awarded to his sister Genevieve for her best-selling novel Claude. When she received the reward, Fauconnier and Genevieve Fauconnier became the only brother and sister in France to have ever received the Prix Goncourt and Prix Femina awards. Visions Fauconnier had hated the Treaty of Versailles: he knew that Europe took the huge risk of repeating the vile war of 1914-18. He did not suffer unduly during the Depression of the 1930s because of his resources in Malaysia, but he was troubled deeply by the rise of Nazism, fascism in Italy, the conquest of Abyssinia, and the Spanish Civil War. In October 1938, he published anonymously a collection New Visions discussing some of his past life (it included \\"The Lady\\", \\"Christmas Malay\\", \\"Indian Dravidian\\", \\"Barbara\\", \\"The Asphod√®les\\" and \\"Vision\\"). The following summer, fearing the ambitions of Benito Mussolini on Tunisia, he took his family from \\"the Terrace\\" to settle in Musset. World War II and the last years Life was not easy during World War II. His children grew up, and he, despite the reservations he had, repatriated to France. He was being gradually cut off from his resources in Belgium, England, Malaysia, and Indochina. He had neither the desire nor the courage to write, but preferred instead to listen to the B.B.C. The postwar period also was difficult, but in 1947 he agreed to be the leader of the \\"Group of Federalists Writers\\" for \\"United States of Europe\\". It was the hope of the group that, in reconciling the people of Europe, they might prevent its governments from claiming national missions. In 1957, he was offered a trip to Malaysia for nostalgia's sake by a society of plantations, which had included the Socfin Rivaud Group. Afterwards, he settled into a quiet retirement during which he remained busy playing tennis and chess, gardening and swimming, dreaming of an opportunity to resume writing a sequel to Malaisie and continuing his correspondence. He divided his time between the C√¥te d'Azur, Paris (where his children and grandchildren lived), and the Charente. In April 1973, Fauconnier died in Paris. He was buried in Barbezieux. His only wish was that Musset be kept in the family.

History Formation (2001‚Äì2008) Blackguard was formed in 2001 by guitarist Terry Roadcase and drummer Justine \\"Juice\\" √âthier as a straight-ahead black metal outfit. The Montreal-based sextet was originally named Profugus Mortis (Latin for \\"Death of a Refugee\\"). Blackguard was officially born with the addition of vocalist Paul Ablaze in October 2004, followed a month later by bassist √âtienne Mailloux. Staying true to their black metal roots, the new Profugus Mortis turned their sights on a brutal new interpretation of Scandinavian folk metal. Blackguard issued a four-song self-produced demo in March 2005, passing them out for free at metal shows in Montreal. In July that same year, Profugus Mortis played the Xtreme Distortion Fest in Montreal with Kataklysm and Unexpect, winning the coveted slot as \\"Best Unsigned Band\\" at the event. This translated into a support slot with Sodom and Finntroll, which earned Profugus Mortis the opportunity to open for Yngwie Malmsteen at the request of Qu√©bec's Capital du Metal. Since then, Blackguard has supported and toured with numerous acts equally respected the world over, including Lacuna Coil, Catamenia, Warbringer, Behemoth, Therion, Into Eternity, Ensiferum, The Agonist, Cryptopsy, Krisiun, Voivod, Moonsorrow, Korpiklaani and Quo Vadis. Profugus Mortis' first professional recording was released in March 2007 and was named So It Begins. This was rather a collection of songs showcasing the band's past and their new direction. So It Begins became the best and fastest selling album in their label Prodisk's history. In January 2008, violinist Emilie Livernois was replaced by former Gotherfall guitarist Kim Gosselin. The band was signed to Nuclear Blast after being selected as the winners of the label's \\"MySpace Band Contest\\". Their first major label debut was entitled Profugus Mortis as a tribute to their past. Keyboardist Jonathan Lefran√ßois-Leduc left Blackguard in June 2010 after Hypocrisy's North American tour. On October 12, 2010, it was announced that Blackguard had switched from Nuclear Blast to Victory Records. Firefight (2009‚Äì2011) After touring for several months before the release of their next album, Firefight, they began selling pre-orders for the album, which was released on March 29, 2011 through Victory Records. During the subsequent tour for Firefight, the band announced the departure of guitarist Kim Gosselin and welcomed Louis Jacques to the band as his replacement. The band released this statement about it: \\"Unfortunately we must officially announce the departure of lead guitarist Kim Gosselin from Blackguard. For those of you who have seen us play during our last few tours this will not come as a shock seeing as Kim has been absent from the live lineup for quite some time.\\" \\"Kim has decided not to continue with the band, and we'd like to thank him for his invaluable contribution to this group over the years. As hard as it is seeing a brother go, this is truly the best thing for both parties as Kim's interest in touring and writing have been waning over the last year. We wanted to wait until we had found a suitable replacement before making any official announcement and we're very happy to finally be able to let everyone in on what's going on.\\" Storm (2012‚Äìpresent) On June 17, 2012, Blackguard announced they have begun work on their next studio album. Vocalist Paul Zinay released this official statement on the band's progress: \\"We are currently hard at work and pre-production is coming along very nice. Everyone here is ecstatic over the material we have. Our new guitarist Louis is a riff machine and working his ass off to help make this the best Blackguard album to date. The writing process this time around is unlike anything we've done before. In the past, one or two people would make up the vast majority of material for the album. This time, however, everyone is contributing ideas and music and the results are beyond my expectations.\\" \\"We will be heading into studio in September to start tracking and we're hoping to have the record out in early 2013. Lyrically, I'm taking a step into new territory by trying my hand at writing a concept album. This won't be as intricate or vast as The Emerald Sword Saga or The Metal Opera, but this will be an exciting and new challenge for me nonetheless. After some delays, Blackguard returned to the studio in May 2013 for their new album Storm at Silver Wings Studios in Montreal, QC. Initial sessions for the album were thought to have taken place back in September. On October 31st, 2013 the band announced the departure of bassist Etienne Mailloux from their lineup. The group then enlisted Dave \\"Ablaze\\" Zinay as his replacement. Dave is the twin brother of the band's lead vocalist, Paul. On May 10, 2014, the band announced on their Facebook page that Vocalist Paul Zinay will be finishing vocal tracks for Storm. On September 22, 2014 the band announced via Facebook, that the album was done. The release date was January 3, 2020.

Current members of the band are lead singer James Robinson, cellist Rob Lewis, bassist Matt Harris, guitarist Dino Randhawa, trumpeter Matt Ellis and drummer Ben Matthews. Career Shortly after the band formed, Jason Mraz stumbled upon Two Spot Gobi playing at a bar in Plymouth on his day off from supporting James Blunt. He fell in love with their upbeat vibe and later invited them to open for him at a few shows in Brighton, UK in the summer of 2007. In the fall of 2008, following further exposure from Perez Hilton, Mraz invited the band to join him on his US tour, and then again on his European tour in 2009. In the summer of 2009, the invitation extended to record at Mraz's home studio in San Diego. Two Spot Gobi spent two months recording their second studio album The Sun Will Rise (2010) with producer Niko Bolas (Neil Young, John Mayer), assisted by Andre De Santanna. Two Spot Gobi have also consistently toured the UK on their own headline shows. The first Two Spot Gobi EP was recorded in 2005 at the University of Sussex. It was a self-recorded EP containing the tracks: \\"Melodious Star\\", \\"That Thing\\", \\"Borrowed Time\\", \\"Lucky 7\\" and \\"Mr Man\\". Never officially released, but it was the collection of songs that won Two Spot Gobi an initial fanbase. The Hey Now EP was recorded in the early 2006 at Sawmills Studios in Cornwall. It was produced and engineered by Tom Joyce. Tracks included \\"Regulations\\", \\"Let's Get Lost\\", \\"Hey Now\\", \\"Senses\\" and a live version of \\"A Difference\\". Their Outside EP was recorded in early 2007 at the University of Glamorgan in Wales and was produced and engineered by Samuel Adebayo (EMI). The tracks were mixed by Mike Pelanconi (Lily Allen) and included \\"Outside\\", \\"Four Walls\\", \\"Mr Man\\", and \\"Better Days\\". The Otherside of the World EP featured the 2008 single, \\"Sunshine Lady\\", released on UK Indie label IRL, a live version of \\"Let's Get Lost\\" featuring Jason Mraz (mixed by Max Gilkes) and two live versions of \\"Innocent\\" and \\"Otherside of the World\\". Perez Hilton, described 'Sunshine Lady' as his \\"perfect summer jam\\" Their debut album, Everywhere You Should Have Been (produced by former Republica guitarist Johnny Male) was released in the US in October 2008 and, in the UK, in April 2009 on US label Musik1. The Sun Will Rise was the band's second studio album, and released on 16 May 2011. The album included the single \\"You Make It Easy\\", which was released on June 2010, as well as the single \\"Guiding Star\\", which was released in February 2011.

Although named a bridge, the structure is the remains of a wharf and fortified port, linked to the defensive curtain of the walled city. History A view of the \\"Old Bridge\\" as seen from bank of the Castle of M√©rtola It is difficult to attribute a valid chronology, because there are few comparable architectural structures; this structure was constructed between the 9th and late 12th centuries, during the Arab occupation of the Iberian peninsula. It is likely to have been destroyed at the end of the 12th century, when they abandoned the settlement. The structure was successively confused with a bridge. It was referred to as a bridge in the 1254 foral (charter), in the design of the coat-of-arms of D. Duarte (dating to 1500), referring to as \\"the piers constructed by the Moors\\", in the Mem√≥rias Paroquiais. In 1956, there was a decision by the Junta Aut√≥noma de Estradas to recuperate the structure.

There are no vestiges on the other margin of the river, and the depth of the river is such that it is difficult to mount other piers.Almeida (1976) In addition to protect the margin, the construction permits (in case of need) the passage to the other bank by barge,Veiga (1880) used in defense and access to water.Torres (1990) It is an aqueduct to support the village, comparable to ones found in Fez and S√≠ria.

Maria (D. Maria Bridge) is an 18th-century bridge which crosses the River Mira in the civil parish of Santa Clara-a-Velha in the municipality of Odemira in the Portuguese district of Beja. It is an 18th-century structure that was constructed on the Roman model, allowing it to remain a functional span until the 19th century, when iron structures were introduced in the region. History A 1748 travellers guide mentioned the locality of Santa Clara as a point of passage between Lisbon and Albufeira, later confirmed by 18th century maps. It is likely a construction that occurred in 1758, at a time when the clergy of Sab√≥ia and S. Clara-a-Velha affirmed that no bridge existed on the Mira River. By the end of the 19th century, maps of the period did not show any roads passing through Santa Clara, even though the village had three stations for changing horses or stopping the night. In 1822, the construction or expansion of the bridge occurred, under the direction of Francisco Lopes do Ros√°rio, and located in relation to an ancient Roman road that connected Beja to the Algarve. Remnants of the former crossing over the River Mira have been lost. By 1849, the municipal council of Odemira referred to the need to reconstruct the \\"old bridge\\" in Santa Clara and the advantage of constructing the new structure at the edge of the village. At the end of the 19th century, the master of public works wrote an inspection report referring to the old masonry bridge over the River Mira along the road between Alentejo and Algarve, a distance of from the village of Santa Clara. In his report, the inspector found the bridge in a terrible state of conservation, with many great fractures along the central vaults, causing depression in the pavement, where water coalesced and accumulated, draining along the cracks...where vehicles pass. The author lamented the state of such an important construction and recommended urgent repair. By the middle of the 20th century, there was a partial landslide. On 25 February 1992, by dispatch of the IPPC, the bridge was classified as Property of Public Interest, and by 31 October 1996, similarly by the IPPAR. On 25 August 2000, it was included in the Odemira PDM (resolution 114/2000, DR 196). Architecture The bridge is located in an isolated, rural position at the end of a valley, crossed by the River Mira, whose margins are densely populated by forest and water lilies. It is an area of great natural landscape, situated near the Pousada de Santa Clara, Santa Clara dam and the community cemetery. The structure consists of stone and limestone masonry, plastered and whitewashed, with arched frames and breakwaters coated stone. The bridge, now ruined, still includes two arches with archivolts and masonry.

History Sometime during the middle of the 14th century, the bridge was constructed, owing to the acronyms on the structure. The roadway had its origins in Braga, crossing the C√°vado River over the port bridge in the direction of Amares (where a shelter existed), bisecting at the path to Geira, to the east, or to north, passing the River Homen at the bridge of Caldelas/Rodas in the direction of Ponte da Barca. Passage along the C√°vado before the construction of the port bridge was made to the west between Ribeiro and Lago. Architecture The bridge is situated in a rural, isolated position over the River C√°vado, between the parishes of Pousada (in Braga) and Prozelo (in Amares), in the locality of Ponte do Porto, along the Estrada Nacional E.N.205 linking Amares and P√≥voa de Lanhoso. There are several houses that line the roadway near the entrance-way to the north of the bridge. The banks of the river is covered in vegetation.

Although originally a Roman bridge, it was re- constructed during the 16th century when the original had been destroyed following flooding and consistent use. There are few vestiges of the Roman bridge. History The shallow cantilever bridge over the C√°vado River The reinforced abutments of the marginal edge of the bridge During the Roman occupation of the Iberian peninsula, there likely existed a bridge that integrated the Roman road between Bracara Augusta (Braga) and Asturica Augusta (Astorga), passing through Ponte de Lima to the northeast territories around Tui. Between 1118 and 1128, the Archbishop Paio Mendes donated goods to the Templar Hospital in Braga, with the condition that two-thirds of their products should be used in the construction of the Ponte de Prado bridge.Avelino Jesus da Costa (1978), p. 359 The Prado Bridge was one of the more important points in the geographic landscape of the medieval territory of Entre-Douro-e-Minho. Its appearance reflects various reconstructions that occurred during the Middle Ages and modern eras, supporting its importance along the centuries.Almeida (1998), p.349 During the Middle Ages, the Roman roads continued to be used (and in many cases they were the only access between points in existence). Within this context, the Prado Bridge was the object of attention. Between the religious center of Braga and one of the oldest towns in the country (Ponte de Lima), the Prado continued to link the north and southern territories. A legend persists that the Leonese king, in order to rendezvous with a maiden he was enamoured with, ordered that the bridge be maintained and its statute reinforced during the medieval period. In 1260, King Afonso III of Portugal conceded a foral (charter) to the town of Prado, initiating a period of growth and importance, with its elevation to the status of municipality. This development was reinforced in 1510, when the foral was confirmed by King Manuel I of Portugal. In the proceeding centuries, the area around the bridge developed into a regional center that eventually drew the eye of the Crown, especially in an intense post-1580 Portuguese succession crisis reorganization. Yet, in the same year, flooding resulted in the demolition of the original bridge.Vieira (1886), p. 410 In 1616 it was reconstructed completely. At the same time, on the central platform two ashlar granite bunks were constructed with decorated inscriptions. It was under the supervision of Ant√≥nio de Castro (during the Philippine Dynasty) that the bridge received its current appearance, which likely eliminated any vestiges of the medieval construction. The memory of this period was marked by an inscription on the bridge, alongside the coats-of-arms for the Philippine monarchs and the Counts of Prado; the architect inscribed his name: Ant√≥nio de Castro de a vila de Vianna.Ribeiro (1998), p.63 The recent history of this bridge has been turbulent; although there has been a need to restore the bridge, many of the projects were delayed, owing to financial issues or political problems. In 1963 and 1976, owing to threats of destruction and the consequences of constant traffic, the Junta Aut√≥noma de Estradas (Autonomous Corporation for Roads) completed projects to consolidate and substitute the pavement on the road. More recently, the Instituto de Estradas de Portugal (Portuguese Institute of Roads), which was the predecessor of Estradas de Portugal, was responsible for cleaning the main pillars. Architecture A panorama of the Ponte do Prado linking Braga and Vila de Prado) The bridge is located in an urban area, crossing the C√°vado River, integrated into the EN201 motorway. The bridge's exit (to the north) fronts the Pra√ßa do Conselheiro Sousa Lima, a gardened area, the site of a 16th-century pillory marking Prado's historical importance as a municipality until the 19th century. The flat-top shallow cantilever bridge consists of nine Roman arches that progressively increase in size the closer to the centre of the span, with the three largest arches slightly peaked. Eight triangularabutments protect the base of the bridge from debris, while polygonal structures downstream act as reinforcements. Located on the left of the central arch and elevated to the level of the surface pavement is a rectangular platform. On this space, there are two decorated structures to commemorate the construction of the bridge, in the form of a seat with backrest, with a central coat of arms on the southern face. Representing the symbol of the Counts of Prado, there is an inscription: :EMQO AN / TO TI / V ER / ES DIA / SM IRA / POR TIS / EPR VDE / NT EAS / ICO MO / PA GA / LA PO / NTE SEPA / GALAVIDABEVEME / NT E Translated from the Portuguese as \\"While you have days look to yourself, if you are prudent, as you pay the bridge, you pay with your life shortly\\". On the northern face of the backrest is a royal coat of arms, with the inscription: :ESTA OBRA FES ANTONI / O DE CRASTO DA VILA DE VIAN / A / 16 / 76 Stating that the project was completed by Ant√≥nio de Crasto from the town of Viana (in 1676). On the left margin is a rectangular space to facilitate passage over the bridge. Also part of this project was the erection of a cross, dedicated to the Senhor da Ponte (Our Lord of the Bridge) on the northern margin, but that did not survive to this day. The pavement is constituted from rectangular blocks, delimited by a paved walkway resting on corbels which allow the passage of pedestrians and by wrought iron guards paced by stone pillars. In the archway soffit there are various abbreviations, such as in the first arch (M, z, y, /, ///) and on the second arch various created from vertical lines.

The film stars Chris Klein, Fred Durst, and Jake Busey. Filming took place at the end of 2006, in Ely, Nevada and Los Angeles, California. The film was ultimately released direct-to-video on September 22, 2009. Plot Ronnie Reno is a former TV action star in need of a comeback. After a failed audition, he ends up snowbound in a remote town in Nevada overrun with meth dealers including Merle and their dimwitted henchman, Ledge, who works as a crossing guard. After Reno finds the body of a dead DEA agent in Ledge's bathtub, he reunites with his former co-stars including Devon in order to save the town's residents and himself. Cast * Chris Klein as Ronnie Reno * Fred Durst as Ledge * Jake Busey as Merle Jones * Michael Beach as Devon * Paul Francis as Ray Jones * Timothy Ryan Hensel as Dickford Jones * James Koetting as Sheriff * Robert Cicchini as TV Announcer Production In 2005, one of the film's eventual producers passed through Ely, Nevada on his way to Utah, while inadvertently leaving his wallet on his car roof. Three weeks later, the White Pine Sheriff's Office contacted the producer, and his wallet was ultimately returned. The occurrence was one reason that Ely was chosen as a filming location for the film. Director Jason Wiles, who wrote the film with producer Shem Bitterman, also chose the area because of its historic mine-town feeling and its wide-open views. Producer Kurt Tuffendsam said, \\"The town is amazing. It's hard to find a place like this.\\" Tuffendsam also said, \\"Our movie actually centers around the town of Ely,\\" unlike the 2001 film Rat Race, in which Ely stood in as Silver City, New Mexico. In November 2006, production scouts planned for scenes to be shot at Ely's nearby Robinson Mine, as well as Steptoe Valley, and the road leading to Cave Lake State Park. Filming began in Los Angeles, California, on November 25, 2006, while filming in Ely was scheduled to begin the following week. On the second day of filming in Ely, a blizzard struck and the film crew did not have the option to wait through it; Bree Hicken, the film's script supervisor, said the film \\"actually turned out better\\" because of the blizzard, stating that the snow helped to make the film a true dark comedy. Play Dead was originally meant to be shot as a summer film. Filming in Ely took place in temperatures as low as 20 degrees below zero, for 12 hours at a time. Filming often continued into the night to allow for perfect shots. The film's climatic scene, which would require extras, was scheduled to be shot on Ely's Aultman Street on the morning of December 8, 2006. Bitterman's 10-year-old daughter, Annabelle, had a role in the film as an endangered resident. Interior and exterior shots of Ely's Hotel Nevada and Gambling Hall were filmed for the movie. Filming concluded in Nevada on December 14, 2006, and returned to Los Angeles on December 17, 2006. Filming concluded two days later. In February 2007, the film was expected to be shown at film festivals after editing was completed. In addition to Tuffendsam and Bitterman, Wiles also served as a producer on the film, alongside Mark Koetting, Mike O'Shea and Tom Rooker. Brett Herrin served as executive producer. A trailer for the film was released in August 2008, advertising a summer release. The film was ultimately released on DVD by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment on September 22, 2009. Reception Tyler Foster of DVD Talk reviewed an early screener DVD copy of the film and wrote, \\"I've had many reactions to movies over the years, but Play Dead elicited a true rarity: complete and utter bewilderment. And I don't mean bewilderment as to what the plot was, who the characters were or things like the geography of scenes, what I mean is: who is this movie intended for? How did all of these actors read it and decide they wanted to do it? How did a co- writer/director (actor Jason Wiles, marking his sophomore directorial effort) with a completely nonsensical movie have the organizational and leadership skills to direct the final product? And most importantly, why did anyone buy it and offer to put it on DVD?\\" Foster concluded, \\"Skip it, I guess...unless you want to try and solve a cinematic puzzle.\\" Jordan Harrison of Home Media Magazine wrote, \\"Play Dead wobbles between the comedy, drama and action genres. It is rich with offensive language, and tries to be funny in places where it should have taken itself seriously. The best thing about the movie was Durst's performance. The film is worth seeing just for his role.\\" References External links * Category:2009 films Category:American films Category:2009 action comedy films Category:2009 black comedy films Category:American action comedy films Category:American black comedy films Category:Films set in Nevada Category:Films shot in Nevada Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:2009 comedy films ","title":"Play Dead (2009 film)"},{"id":"26135126","text":"Cavez Bridge is a medieval bridge that crosses the T√¢mega River, located in Cavez, Braga District, in Portugal.

Crossing the river Ave in the district of Braga, the bridge connects either margin lined with picturesque houses. History Limited by the Serra do Carvalho, Serra da Cabreira and Serra do Ger√™s, the bridge is situated in a cross-roads territory that links Braga with Chaves, across the Serra do Ger√™s, and between Braga and Guimar√£es. Its central location was important in groups that lived between this region, in particular during the Iron Age and Roman period of occupation. Many of the buildings that surround margins attest to the age associated with these periods. Among many of the medieval structures, the Ponte de Mem Gutierres or Ponte de Esperan√ßa (as it is also known) was probably built between 14th and 15th century. Due to its age and regional importance, it was included in the first Portuguese document to classify old structures as National Monuments in 1910. In 1976, there was work to repair the pavement and reinforcements, with a project in 1977 to conserve and consolidate the arch. Architecture The structure is a single arch bridge, consisting a vaulted arc, reinforced on either side of the margin. It has very narrow, long staves with irregular extrados, and reinforced with rectangular abutments. Constructed in granite stonework, the pavement was asphalted.

In the early 17th Century the main vernacular forms for Spanish and Portuguese composers were the villancico, usually a Christmas song, and the solo tono; tono humano if secular, tono divino if sacred. The cantata form had not yet been introduced from Italy. At this point tonos were generally strophic songs (coplas) with a refrain (estribillo).Jer√≥nimo Nieto Magdaleno, Rita Goldberg Tonos a lo divino y a lo humano 1981 p28George J. Buelow A history of baroque music 2004 p375 However by the end of the 17th century some tonos had begun to include recitative and aria sections, as the cantada, Spanish form of the cantata became known around 1700. The tono humano and tono divino could also have 2, 3 or 4 voices.Kurt L. Levy, Jes√∫s Antonio Ara, Gethin Hughes Calder√≥n and the Baroque tradition 1985 p73 Emperor Leopold I in Vienna requests his ambassador in Madrid \\"will you therefore see that you send me some tonos humanos for one, two or at most three voices\\" Nearly all tonos humanos and semi-sacred villancicos were preserved only in manuscript. The best copies were in the Royal Palace in Madrid and in the nearby Buen Retiro, both of which were lost in fires. This, and the fall from fashion of the tono and villancico in the Iberian Peninsula, means that sources in Latin America are relatively important to recovery of this part of Iberian musical heritage.John H.

The relationship with Peter continued until his death in January 1725, when Catherine became Empress regnant and Maria was forced to leave court. She was a lady in waiting to princess Natalia in 1727‚Äì28 and to Empress Anna Ivanovna in 1730‚Äì31. Later she hosted a literary salon in Saint Petersburg. The Swedish slave Lovisa von Burghausen mentions Maria in her autobiography. Burghausen, as the prisoner of Dimitrie Cantemir in 1713-1714, credited Maria and her sister Smaragda with saving her from freezing to death during a punishment by allowing her to sleep in their bedroom instead of in an unheated stone room in the middle of winter.Alf √Öberg: Karolinska Kvinno√∂den (Fates of women in the Carolinian age) Alf √Öberg: F√•ngars el√§nde.

History The medieval bridge was constructed between the 13th and 14th century and maintains the original lines and construction. The bridge was first referenced in the 1758 Mem√≥rias Paroquiais, a chronicle of civic communities. In 1993, there was a project by the JAE to enlarge the bridge. A year later (on 12 April) the municipal council began to manage the bridge, owing to the necessity to expropriate lands for the expansion of the bridge. At the same time (23 April) the civil parish council debated the possibility of classifying the bridge a municipal patrimony, along with a mill and lagar, which was ultimately rejected. Between May and July, the civil parish requested that the municipality should examine the bridge and ascertain it patrimonial importance. On 16 July, the executive communicated to the council their attempts to classify the bridge, even as the first expropriations were undertaken. On 31 August, the municipal council proposed the classification of the bridge, which was later supported by the 24 January 1995 decision by the Regional Directorate of Castelo Branco to open a process to classify the bridge on 24 February. The national IPPAR would eventually impede the expansion and proposed the construction of alternative bridge along the river. Architecture The bridge is situated along the accessway to the urban centre of the civil parish of Pa√∫l, for those travelling from the city of Covilh√£.

Background and positions held In 2010, Porter lived with his parents in Norbury, south London. His father is a policeman who grew up in London and his mother is a teacher from Trinidad. Porter studied at Wilson's School in Wallington in south London, before studying English Literature at the University of Leicester, graduating with a BA in 2006. He took a leading role in the University of Leicester Students' Union, serving as the Union's Finance and Services Officer, and then as its Academic Affairs Officer, as well as being the editor of the student magazine, The Ripple. Prior to becoming NUS President, Porter was twice elected as the NUS Vice-President (Higher Education), serving from July 2008 to June 2010. He was the first officer from the University of Leicester Students' Union to be elected to the National Union of Students' Executive Committee. Presidency of the National Union of Students Porter stood for the Presidency of the NUS as the candidate of the Organised Independents faction, but is a member of the Labour Party. He was subsequently elected with a 65% majority and took office in June 2010, which he would hold for the period of one year. Taking control of the Union, Porter put forward his views that he was in favour of lowering the voting age to sixteen, and stated he would lead a national demonstration against the government's planned rise in tuition fees before any vote in Parliament on the issue. On taking up the NUS Presidency, Porter was profiled in The Observer where he re-stated his opposition to any increase in tuition fees as well as the need for a new approach to campaigning that includes both formal lobbying as well as active campaigning. Backing a graduate tax as an alternative method of financing higher education, Porter stated that funding would need to be fair and progressive for students to support it. A keynote speech on the future of higher education warned of the implications of a funding crisis. He has also been vocal on the issue of graduate employment with significant national coverage. In November 2010, Porter appeared on the Daily Politics television show, arguing against the raising of students' tuition fees. In response to the review of Higher Education Funding and Student Finance chaired by Lord Browne, the National Union of Students organised a National Demonstration in London jointly with the University and College Union. 50,000 protestors took part in the protest, at the end of which Porter addressed a rally outside Tate Britain. During the immediate aftermath of this demonstration on 10 November 2010, by over 50,000 people, Porter condemned the occupation of the Conservative Party's headquarters, referring to it as \\"violence by a tiny minority\\". In January 2011 at an anti-cuts march and rally in Manchester, Porter was escorted away by police from a small section of the crowd of student protesters who were heckling and shouting \\"you're a Tory too\\" ‚Äì a chant commonly used against Liberal Democrats during the student fees protests.

The structure was totally reconstructed during the Reconquista, and integrated into the secondary military line that connected Salgueiro to Meimoa, winding through the Via Lata. Legend suggests that a Roman bridge existed on the site, and was destroyed during the Reconquista, which was part of the line connecting M√©rida to Viseu, and that crossed the district of Castelo Branco, the settlements of Idanha-a-Velha, Medelim, Bemposta, Mata, Torre dos Namorados, Meimoa and Capinha. In 1607, a charter by King Philip II placed the construction of the bridge in the hands of Gon√ßalo Sanches, a stonemason and resident of Castelo Branco, for 4750 cruzados (collected from payments from the cities of Guarda, Viseu, Lamego, Porto, Guimar√£es, Viana do Castelo and Torre de Moncorvo.

This may actually be the nearby Ponte de S√£o Br√°s or Ponta da Assureira. The bridge linked the Roman road to Espanha through Portela do Homem, passing through Estrimo (in Spain), Ameixoeira, Porto do Vaga and Assureira - Cova da Velha - Varziela - Castro Laboreiro.

History The bridge was probably constructed in the 14th century. On 1 November 1386, the army crossed the bridge during their clash with the Duke of Lancaster (Master of Avis), pretender to the throne of Castille and Leon. The bridge is similar to various other medieval bridges that were based in older Roman structures that crossed rivers in the region, but reconstructed in the early Middle Ages. In actuality, there are few elements that can be attributed to the period, except the arch structure, \\"made up of sizable blocks of granite\\".Paulo Mendes Pinto (1998), p.76. Particularly their lower sections, may date from that time. Also the profile of the will, perfectly round, should be an element of the Roman period, subsequently kept in low-medieval reform, as much of the floor, based on large slabs of regular whittle. There is evidence that the bridge was reformed sometime between the 13th and 14th century. The platform with double non- horizontal ramp trestle, the integration of ashlars of lesser quality and formally heterogeneous, the narrowness of the road and the pavement, using small stones on the sidewalk, are the most obvious indicators. Moreover, the bridge has a slight curve, which may be a medieval feature (although shortened), yet the width of the structure is not a common typological feature of Roman public works. In 1386, the bridge was the location selected by King John I, and his future father-in-law, the Duke of Lancaster, in order to celebrate the accord between the \\"new\\" Portugal of Avis and England, that resulted in the marriage between the King John and Philippa of Lancaster. It is unclear, though, when the bridge was reformulated during the medieval bridge. An√≠bal Soares Ribeiro suggests that it might have occurred around the 1480s.An√≠bal Soares Ribeiro (1998), p.175 The bridge was recuperated by Amaro Franco in 1627, receiving a stipend of 880,000 Portuguese reis for the service. In 1864, the bridge was on the verge of ruin, with a missing section to the south, \\"in the vault and centre of the bridge, which if not remedied would result in danger\\", and excessive costs to the local parish. The decision must have been taken to construct a new bridge, parallel the medieval bridge, which was constructed in 1882. On 1 December 1960, the municipal council inaugurated a commemorative plaque. In 2006, the municipal council of Mon√ß√£o elaborated a plan to recuperate the zone, divided into two zones of intervention. The first included the space north between the EN202 and Rio Mouro and south from the cross of Nossa Senhora da Soledade and west; the second area included the parish of Ceiv√£es. Architecture The bridge is situated in an urbanized area, constructed over the margins of a great and deep gorge, carved from the Rio Mouro, a small affluent on the left branch of the Minho River, that separated the parishes of Barbeita and Ceiv√£es. It is located alongside the parochial church, mill and other buildings, while overlooked by the modern bridge. The single arch structure, is preceded by ramps, over a single, large round arc. Its pavement consists of large slabs and guards of primed block and plastered masonry.

Harcourt Brace) Dusk of Dawn: An Essay Toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept is a 1940 autobiographical text by W. E. B.

Preceded decades prior by the better-known The Souls of Black Folk (1903), Dusk of Dawn focuses on Du Bois's relationship with Booker T. Washington, his reasons for leaving the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and a new concept of race. In contrast to Washington's Up From Slavery, a blend of slave narrative and autobiography, Dusk of Dawn traces the genealogy of the race concept as it affected Du Bois's life. Du Bois elucidates his theoretical writing with personal experiences, and connects those experiences to the larger historical and social phenomena he identifies as central to the function and development of race in the United States. Reviewing the book in 1940, Metz P. Lochard, editor of the Chicago Defender, said \\"[i]t is no mere autobiography in the conventional sense... [Du Bois] very adroitly utilizes his life experience as an axis from which he surveys the whole panorama of American civilization with its vice and virtue, its prejudice and philanthropy, its consistency and grace; and above all with its contradictory and conflicting interpretations of race, Christianity and [d]emocracy.\\"Dubois new book points way out of segregation.

Du Bois: Writings. New York: > Library of America, 1987; 651.  Chapters and major themes  The chapters of Dusk of Dawn can be divided thematically into three sections. The first four chapters focus on autobiographical information, contextualizing each anecdote in the relevant current events of its time. The next three chapters shift to a more ideological subject‚Äîthe concept of race. Du Bois uses these chapters to theorize on race as a psychological complex of irrational logics and habits which are perpetuated to support an economically exploitative society. The final two chapters return to autobiography, chronicling Du Bois's life and ideology from 1910 to 1940.  Apology   The Plot   A New England boy and Reconstruction  :Du Bois begins with his childhood in Great Barrington and recounts his experiences through his graduation from high school.  Education in the Last Decades of the Nineteenth Century  :Du Bois recounts his experiences at Fisk University and his studies in Germany. He notes that while he was thinking critically about race, his analysis was confined to \\"the relation of my people to the world movement. I was not questioning the world movement in itself.\\"Du Bois, Dusk of Dawn; an Essay toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept, 27.  Science and Empire  :This chapter covers the years 1894‚Äì1910. During this period, Du Bois began teaching, attended the Niagara Movement, and published The Crisis. His thinking also shifted during this time. He became increasingly disillusioned with the ability of scientific evidence to transform racial bias. Instead, he began to think about racism as \\"forces or ideologies [that] embraced more than our reasoned acts. They included physical, biological and psychological forces; habits, conventions and enactments.\\"Du Bois, Dusk of Dawn, 96. :  The Concept of Race  :Du Bois argues for the arbitrariness of race, pointing to the \\"continuous change in the proofs and arguments advanced\\" in discussions on race in which \\"the basis of race distinction was changed without explanation, without apology.\\"Du Bois, Dusk of Dawn, 99. He also offers a detailed description of his family tree as he discusses themes of miscegenation, racial \\"chauvinism\\", and the role of Africa in black identity.  The White World  :In this chapter, he challenges the dominance of the white world, stating plainly that \\"the democracy which the white world seeks to defend does not exist. It has been splendidly conceived and discussed, but not realized.\\"Du Bois, Dusk of Dawn, 169. Instead, the white world insists on \\"group and racial exclusiveness,\\"Du Bois, Dusk of Dawn, 137. creating a campaign of propaganda in which racist ideals are not mutually exclusive with democracy and Christian morality. In a conversation with a white character, Roger Van Dieman, Du Bois exposes the psychological and social paradox of racial inequality.  The Colored World Within  :\\"The present question is: What is the colored world going to do about the current situations?\\"Du Bois, Dusk of Dawn, 175. :Du Bois reflects on the status of African Americans, their exclusion from institutions, and the various social and political inequalities that are misread as natural inferiorities. With this in mind, he outlines an economic plan called \\"the Negro co-operative movement\\".Du Bois, Dusk of Dawn, 212. This plan recognizes the power African Americans hold as consumers, and proposes that by utilizing the production capacities African Americans already have the African-American community can achieve a level of social and political autonomy unthinkable for the time.  Propaganda and the World War  :Du Bois discusses the major events that shaped his politics as outlined in chapter 7: his involvement with the NAACP, the impact of the World War on Black consciousness in the United States, the significance of the Great Migration, the development of his Pan-African awareness, and the seizure of Haiti by the United States.  Revolution  :In the concluding chapter, Du Bois reflects the influence of Marx on his thinking,Du Bois, Dusk of Dawn, 287. his many trips abroad, and his \\"Basic American Negro Creed\\"‚Äîa manuscript of \\"that economic program of the Negro which I believed should succeed.\\"Du Bois, Dusk of Dawn, 319-322. Du Bois also discusses his artistic endeavors, the ways he encouraged creative expression in the black community, and his emphasis on graphic arts. \\"I sought to encourage the graphic arts not only by magazine covers with Negro themes and faces, but as often as I could afford, I portrayed the faces and features of colored folk.\\"Du Bois, Dusk of Dawn, 271. Having grown up in the nearly all-white Great Barrington, Massachusetts, Du Bois experienced a cultural awakening in 1885 when he entered the historically black Fisk University as a sophomore. He writes that at Fisk he realized he had not been taught anything positive about black people. He becomes enamored with their various shades of skin tone. \\"From my childhood I have been impressed with the beauty of Negro skin-color and astonished at the blindness of whites who cannot see it.\\"Du Bois, Dusk of Dawn, 272.

History During the Roman period, this area was part of the Lima to Minho axis, a roadway that connected Braga to the northwestern peninsula, and was a point of passage, if not terminal line (from conclusions of Ferreira de Almeida in 1987). In the immediate vicinity, in the local of Chamosinhos, are vestiges of Romana structures, and specifically a millenarian marker.Ferreira de Almeida (1987), p.165 The bridge was re-constructed between the 13th and 14th century. The double ramp, which was not entirely horizontal, had some interventions in order support the structure.An√≠bal Soares Ribeiro (1998), p.194 Although it maintained its semi-perfect Roman arch, the fact that the staves were \\"long and narrow\\" indicates that the bridge was reconstructed. Medieval reforms during the time affected eastern territories, allowing more human migration and helping to support inter-regional commercial traffic, substantiating the idea that the bridge was reconstructed during the time. Meanwhile, other opinions point to its re-construction during the modern epoch. Architecture The bridge is situated in an urban area, crossing the main river in the settlement of S√£o Pedro da Torre, surrounded by a few buildings. In the same settlement, almost is another smaller bridge over the same river. The bridge maintains some of the characteristics attributable to the Roman period: which include the \\"Roman\\" arch and double ramp, its regular base and pavement, which is still largely Roman in nature, using large, homogeneous slabs and carefully placed. The platform is preceded by access ramps, and the platform constructed of Portuguese pavement forms a trestle that is almost imperceivable over a single arch. Constructed of granite blocks/slabs, simple guardrails flank either side of the platform.

History Historians believe that the primitive bridge was most likely constructed between the 2nd century B.C. and 1st century A.D. It was built as an integration into the Roman road network that supported two secondary or municipal tracks (Viae vicinales) between Moimenta da Beira, Tabua√ßo and the Douro River, that converge on this location. The bridge was constructed during the Middle Ages. On 23 December 1639, the power of attorney passed to Ant√≥nio Fernandes de Oliveira, who was responsible for collecting monies from feints for its reconstruction, and had been previously sold by David Alvarez. In the 1758 Mem√≥rias Paroquiais, signed by Father Pedro Souto of Santa Leoc√°dia, the two-arch bridge was referred to as having no guardrail, since it was incomplete. This was remedied by the 19th century, when guardrails were installed on the bridge. By the middle of the 20th century, the surface was covered in bitumen to provide safe conditions for automobile, but part of the resurfaced bridge was destroyed by an automobile accident, that damaged the paraments. By 1980, the Direc√ß√£o-Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (Directorate-General for Buildings and National Monuments) removed the asphalt and resurfaced the platform with Portuguese pavement. Architecture The bridge is situated in an isolated, rural location in a deep valley with thick vegetation that includes chestnut, oak and olive trees, alongside vineyards and agricultural lands. The bridge follows the EM roadway between Santo Adri√£o and Tabua√ßo, crossing the Rio Tedo. An affluent of the Douro, the Tedo limits the municipalities of Tabua√ßo and Armamar, at the former-parish of Santo Adri√£o: it is accessible from the municipal CM1101 roadway from the national EN313. The identical double arch bridge, is supported by talhamares on either margin, its arches decorated with archivolts. The origin of the Tedo name originated with the Christian warrior that during the Reconquista dominated the lands of the region. The lateral guardrails are constructed of two-high vertical stone blocks and mortar, with the pavement formed from granite slabs.

Its members appear throughout the history of the Roman Republic, and into imperial times. The first of the gens to achieve prominence was Marcus Pomponius, tribune of the plebs in 449 BC; the first who obtained the consulship was Manius Pomponius Matho in 233 BC.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 493 (\\"Pomponia Gens\\"). Origin In the latter part of the Republic, it was common for various gentes to claim descent from the founding figures of Rome; the companions of Aeneas, Romulus, or those who came to Rome in the time of the kings. The Pomponii claimed to be descended from Pompo, one of the sons of Numa Pompilius, the second King of Rome, whose image appears on some of their coins. Several other gentes also claimed Numa as their ancestor.Livy, i. 20.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Numa\\", 21.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 30, 168, 582 (\\"Aemilia Gens\\", \\"Ancus Marcius\\", \\"Calpurnia Gens\\"), vol. II, p. 940 (\\"Marcia Gens\\"), vol. III, pp. 366, 367, 493 (\\"Pinaria Gens\\", \\"Pomponia Gens\\").Grueber, Coins of the Roman Republic, ii. p. 311, no. 733; p. 361, no. 62. Pompo, asserted as the name of the ancestor of the Pompilii, does indeed appear to have been an ancient praenomen of Sabine origin. It was the Oscan equivalent of Quintus, a very common name. Numa's father is said to have been named Pompo Pompilius, and it is evident that the nomen Pompilius was itself a patronymic surname derived from Pompo. Pomponius appears to be derived from an adjectival form of that name, and the equivalent of the Latin nomen Quinctilius. Thus, it is reasonably certain that some ancestor of the Pomponii was indeed named Pompo, although the claim that he was the son of Numa may well be a later addition.Michael Grant, Roman Myths, pp. 123, 139. An alternative explanation suggested during the early nineteenth century, was that the name might be derived from an Etruscan root, Pumpu or Pumpili.M√ºller, Die Etrusker, vol. I, p. 476. In her History of Etruria, Mrs. Hamilton Gray supposed Pumpu to have been the name of Numa's mother, adopted as a surname according to a tradition common to the Etruscan and Sabine cultures.Gray, History of Etruria, vol. II, p. 34. Praenomina The Pomponii used a wide variety of praenomina. The principal names were Marcus, Lucius, and Titus. A few of the Pomponii bore the praenomina Quintus, Publius, and Sextus. The illustrious family of the Pomponii Mathones favored Manius, and there are individual instances of Gaius and Gnaeus. Branches and cognomina In the earliest times, the Pomponii were not distinguished by any surname, and the only family that rose to importance in the time of the Republic bore the surname Matho. On coins we also find the cognomina Molo, Musa, and Rufus, but none of these occur in ancient writers. The other surnames found during the Republic, such as Atticus, were personal cognomina. Numerous surnames appear in imperial times.

The organization also it puts on programs in efforts to educate fellow students about Islam through \\"Islam Awareness Quarter.\\" MSU has also co-sponsored events such as Invisible Children, which brings light to and raises funds for the plight of Ugandan child soldiers, and Fashion Fighting Famine, a student- led initiative which seeks to promote basic human rights across the globe through charity fashion shows and themed parties. Since its founding in 2007, Fashion Fighting Famine has raised and donated over $10,000 to various places including the Palestinian territories and Sudan. In the 2009‚Äì2010 college school year, MSU consistently collected donations and spread awareness about the devastating events that took place in Indonesia and Haiti. Through coin drives, selling food on campus, and other creative ways, MSU sponsored relief efforts for Haiti.UCI Support for Haiti After the deadly southeast Asian tsunami disaster in 2004, MSU raised $12,000 in relief money for countries affected by the disaster. Additionally, the MSU regularly collaborates with campus organizations to put on a variety of different events. In 2008 and 2009, MSU co-sponsored a week of events entitled \\"Gears of War.\\" In the Winter Quarter of 2009, the purpose of this week was to host \\"a series of events surrounding the 6th anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq and the role of the university in supporting imperialism\\" and \\"to highlight issues concerning the occupations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Palestine and elsewhere and discuss how we can collectively organize against imperialism throughout the world.\\" The week was co-hosted by the UCI Worker Student Alliance, Muslim Student Union, Amnesty International at UCI, Darfur Action Committee, Campaign for Consciousness, and Students for a Sensible Drug Policy.

As part of this series of events, the Muslim Student Union hosted at the time British MP and founder of Viva Palestina, George Galloway, for a speech at UC Irvine. During the event, funds were raised for Viva Palestina.

In May 2010, campus officials concluded that there was no evidence to say that the MSU was responsible for any wrongdoing, and after referring the matter to the office of the Vice-Chancellor, the organization has since then been cleared of these allegations.Letter of clearance On May 14, 2010, Amir Abdul Malik Ali, a pro-Palestinian activist from Oakland, California gave an address.

Earlier in the day, the MSU had issued a press release condemning his presence on the campus. They criticized Oren as \\"an outspoken supporter of the recent war on Gaza and stands in the way of international law by refusing to cooperate with the United Nation's Goldstone Report, a fact-finding mission endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council.\\" The university administration said that it was deeply embarrassed by the MSU's actions, shutting down the event midway through Ambassador Oren's speech to maintain order.

Suspension by the university According to the OC Register, a May 27 letter ‚Äì obtained and released by the Jewish Federation ‚Äì sent to the Muslim Student Union from the student affairs disciplinary committee detailed the results of the investigation after the Israeli Ambassador protest in February 2010. The letter stated that after a thorough internal investigation it found that the group had violated university policies against \\"disruption of teaching, research, administration, disciplinary procedures or other University activities,\\" and that it was responsible for \\"other forms of dishonesty including, but not limited to fabricating information, false information, or reporting a false emergency to the University.\\" In response to the findings, the university recommended the suspension of the Muslim Student Union for the 2010‚Äì2011 academic school year, a yearlong probationary period for the following year, and collective completion of 50 hours of volunteer service by the union's members.Muslim student group suspension appealed Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, wrote to the Los Angeles Times criticizing those who disrupted the speech of the Israeli Ambassador, saying \\"those who yelled to keep the ambassador from being heard were not engaged in constitutionally protected behavior.\\" Shortly after the disruption, but before the investigation and suspension, Chermerinsky wrote, \\"I also disagree with those who call for draconian sanctions against these students or of punishment for a larger group. Only the students who were actually disruptive should be punished.\\" After the university recommended suspension, Chermerinsky said, \\"What they found was that a group of students, the Muslim Student Union, engaged in intentional disruptive behavior that violated the student conduct code, misrepresented to the university in advance and after what they were doing is an organization that can and should be punished.\\"\\"At UC Irvine, Campus Rules and the First Amendment.\\" KCRW 89.9 FM.

The suspension was condemned by the Asian Law Caucus, expressing concerns that the suspension would \\"deprive hundreds of current and future Muslim students of their First Amendment right to freedom of association.\\" Some Jewish groups welcomed the suspension, calling it a victory against hate speech.

In September 2010, after the MSU filed the appeal to the recommendation of the suspension, UC Irvine decided to suspend the group for one quarter instead of one year. However, the group's community service was increased to 100 hours of community service instead of the original 50. In addition, UC Irvine put the organization on probation for two years instead of one.MSU Suspension Decision Reached\\"UC Irvine upholds suspension of Muslim group, bans it for one quarter.\\" Several Muslim students at UCI described experiencing a more hostile environment in the time after the suspension. Incoming union Vice President Hadeer Soliman stated that various members endured personal attacks and received hate mail. Student leader Hamza Siddiqui stated that Muslim students were \\"afraid and looking over their shoulder\\", describing many students as worrying that since \\"they went after [the protesters], how do we know they aren‚Äôt going to come after us next?\\" Criminal charges In February 2011, the Orange County district attorney's office charged the eleven arrested MSU students with counts of conspiracy to disturb a lawful meeting and the disturbance of the meeting.Santa Cruz, Nicole. \\"Protesters who disrupted Israeli ambassador at UC Irvine charged by prosecutors.\\" Los Angeles Times. February 4, 2011. February 5, 2011. Many opposed these criminal charges, including Dean Chermerinsky, the UC Irvine dean who had issued the MSU suspension. The same month, more than 90 members of faculty at University of California Irvine wrote a letter to the District Attorney, published in New University, opposing the criminal charges. They stated: > But the individual students and the Muslim Student Union were disciplined > for this conduct by the University, including the MSU being suspended from > being a student organization for a quarter. This is sufficient punishment. > There is no need for criminal prosecution and criminal sanctions. The use of > the criminal justice system will be detrimental to our campus as it > inherently will be divisive and risk undoing the healing process which has > occurred over the last year. It also sets a dangerous precedent for the use > of the criminal law against non-violent protests on campus. In March 2011, 30 members of the Jewish studies faculty from seven campuses of University of California called for the dropping of charges against 11 Muslim students. They said \\"while we disagree with the students' decision to disrupt the speech, we do not believe such peaceful protest should give rise to criminal liability.\\" Erwin Chermerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, had earlier written to the Los Angeles Times that \\"the punishment should be great enough to convey that the conduct was wrong and unacceptable, but it should not be so severe as to ruin these students' educational careers.\\" District Attorney Tony Rackauckas defended the decision to pursue charges against the students, saying \\"These defendants meant to stop this speech and stop anyone else from hearing his ideas, and they did so by disrupting a lawful meeting. This is a clear violation of the law and failing to bring charges against this conduct would amount to a failure to uphold the Constitution.\\"Jolly, Vik, et al. \\"11 Muslim students face charges in UCI protest.\\" The Orange County Register.

Susan Schroeder, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said, \\"It seems that the basic question is what if we substituted different groups ‚Äì what if this were the Klu Klux Klan ' who conspired to silence a speech by Martin Luther King.\\" The leaders of the Zionist Organization of America said in a public statement: > We're pleased to see that the District Attorney's office is not hesitating > to hold members of the Muslim Student Union responsible for possibly > criminal behavior. Had the District Attorney decided not to prosecute, he'd > be sending the message that the disrupters' conduct was acceptable, > effectively making a mockery of the First Amendment and a mockery of our > laws.

Cecilie Surasky of Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) noted that while JVP hecklers did not face criminal charges when they disrupted a speech by Benjamin Netanyahu in November 2010, the MSU hecklers were charged with regard to the Oren incident. Rachel Roberts, in an editorial for The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles entitled \\"Muslim criminals, Jewish activists?\\", said that there are double standards in the treatment of Muslim students, calling the criminal charges against the Muslim students discrimination. The Muslim Public Affairs Council promoted a petition in defense of the students. Legal scholar Faiza Majeed has raised questions about the constitutionality and the policy implications of the prosecution of the students. In September 2011, ten of the eleven MSU students who interrupted Oren's speech were convicted of a misdemeanor in California and sentenced to probation in addition to a fine. Shortly after the verdict, District Attorney Tony Rackauckas wrote, \\"History tells us of the dire consequences when one group is allowed to shout down and intimidate another or a group of people so as to not allow them to have opinions or be heard. History requires us to draw a line in the sand against this sort of organized thuggery.\\"\\"Making Martyrs of the Irvine 11.\\" The Investigative Project on Terrorism. October 3, 2011.

Workshops chaired for DOE OSTI were in May 2000 and February 2007. The former considered issues related to communication, dissemination, and use of information in the physical sciences and made recommendations for increasing the productivity of the scientific enterprise in the United States. The latter focused on strategies to accelerate the spread of knowledge about science and technology. Human Genome Project As a result of reports proposing the project and outlining its scope provided to him by Charles DeLisi, Associate Director of Energy Research for Health and Environmental Research, in Fiscal Year 1987 Dr. Trivelpiece supported, through the use of reprogrammed funds at DOE, the beginnings that led to the Human Genome Project. An April 1987, DOE's Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER) Health and Environmental Research Advisory Committee (HERAC) report recommended that DOE and the nation commit to a large, multidisciplinary, scientific, and technological undertaking to map and sequence the human genome. Earmarked spending began in Fiscal Year 1988 when the Human Genome Project was established by congressional action at both the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and DOE. The chart used in the Spring of 1986 by Trivelpiece to brief Deputy Secretary William F. Martin and Under Secretary Joseph Salgado regarding his intention to reprogram $4 million to initiate the Department's Human Genome Project is available here . This reprogramming was followed by a line item budget of $16 million the following year. This modest effort triggered the activities that led to the sequencing of the Human Genome. A letter from then Department of Energy Deputy Secretary William Flynn Martin accrediting these achievements to Dr. Trivelpiece can be seen here . A speech given to the American Physical Society in 2005 by Dr. Trivelpiece on DOE's role in such major project can be seen here as well as his article on the same subject in the Fall 2005 Forum on the History of Physics Newsletter.

Abhisda b. Jacob, was the Samaritan High Priest (Cohen Godal). He had inherited the office upon the death of Elazar ben Tsedaka ben Yitzhaq as the eldest priest of the family of priests. He was considered by Samaritans to be a direct descendant of Aaron and the 132nd High Priest to hold the office since the time of Moses. Ab-Chisda and other priests, regulate daily life in a number of ways. They ensure the strict rules of religious observance are preserved. This includes traditions such as the full keeping of Sabbath and other Levitical laws. They also serve as arbitrators and judges, as well as set the calendar. This is called Ishban Kashta, which translates from Arabic as \\"truth calculation\\". One of High Priest Aharon ben Ab-Chisda's main duties is to preside over the Passah (Passover) ritual. He did so for the first time in 2010 at the age of 83. The Samaritan community more than doubled during the 20th century, but is still very small. Fewer than 750 of the faithful, the total community, attended the rite. During the performance of the Passover ritual, Ab-Chisda wore a green silken robe. It was secured with a broad cloth, carefully tied. He wore a tallit, draped over his head. This attire is connected with a long tradition that the Samaritans trace back to Biblical times. Before attaining the office of high priest, he was a deputy high priest and well known as a singer in the small Samaritan community. He was married with four sons, two daughters, and six grandsons.

Bacterial glutathione transferases (GSTs; EC 2.5.1.18) are part of a superfamily of enzymes that play a crucial role in cellular detoxification.Liu S, Liu F, Jia H, Yan Y, Wang H, Guo X, Xu B. 2016. A glutathione S-transferase gene associated with antioxidant properties isolated from Apis cerana cerana. Scientific National 103: 43 The primary role of GSTs is to catalyze the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with the electrophilic centers of a wide variety of molecules. The most commonly known substrates of GSTs are xenobiotic synthetic chemicals. There are also classes of GSTs that utilize glutathione as a cofactor rather than a substrate. Often these GSTs are involved in reduction of reactive oxidative species toxic to the bacterium. Conjugation with glutathione receptors reders toxic substances more soluble, and therefore more readily exocytosed from the cell.  Classes and roles  Bacterial glutathione transferases are widely distributed in aerobic bacteria and are classified into several classes. These classes are organized according to the protein sequence and structure. In bacteria, the theta class GSTs includes all of the currently known bacterial glutathione transferases. Between classes, these proteins have less than 25% sequence identity, while members of the same class match about 40% amino acid sequence identity. In comparison to eukaryotes, studies have shown that most of the residues that are highly conserved in theta and other bacterial class GSTs are not retained in those of the alpha, mu, and pi classes of eukaryotic GSTs. The considerable amount of protein sequence variation has led to the general belief that GSTs carry out a very wide variety of glutathione-dependent conjugation functions. No other currently known proteins have the same overall topology as GST enzymes. Bacterial glutathione transferases are not detected in anaerobic bacteria or archaea. These antioxidant enzymes are a part of the glutathione biosynthetic pathway, which is present in cyanobacteria, proteobacteria, and certain Gram-negative bacteria. Bacterial GSTs are involved in a variety of distinct processes such as biotransformation of toxic compounds, protection against several stresses, and antibacterial drug resistance. GSTs also have important roles in metabolism, such as signaling-ligand biosynthesis, tyrosine depredation, peroxide breakdown, and dehydroascorbate reduction.  Glutathione  As the key substrate in GST-mediated reactions, glutathione is one of the most conserved reducing agents in bacterial cells. In its reduced form, glutathione plays a key role in the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell. ROS are specific to aerobic cells and are usually produced in their metabolic processes. They function to maintain a dynamic balance under normal conditions, acting as intracellular and extracellular signaling molecules. The regulation of levels of ROS, levels of oxidized and reduced glutathione and other thiols, and antioxidant enzymes (such as GSTs and glutathione reductase) are important in determination of the most stable conditions for redox control, or for activation of apoptosis. Glutathione reductase is another enzyme that helps maintain cellular redox homeostasis by maintaining the supply of reduced glutathione. Without glutathione in its reduced form, glutathione transferases are not able to utilize it as a substrate in redox reactions. Glutathione contains a significant amount of cysteine residues, which contributes to its nature of being readily oxidized. The -SH groups on these residues act as strong nucleophiles, which can conjugate with a variety of molecules, including other glutathione molecules. Sulfur itself is able to exist in several different oxidation states; this redox flexibility combined with its strong nucleophilic properties allows glutathione to oxidize/readily pick up electrons from reactive oxygen species. Glutathione transferases play a key role in catalyzing such reactions.  Structure  Bacterial glutathione transferases of all classes are homodimeric enzymes (although heterodimeric isozymes of certain classes are also known). Monomers fold into a two-domain configuration to form the active enzyme structure. These globular proteins have an N-terminal domain that consists of a mixture of alpha-helices and beta strands, while the C-terminal domain is all-helical. The N-terminal domain contains the glutathione-binding site and is a highly conserved region among all GSTs. This domain has a similar composition to thioredoxins, which act as antioxidants by facilitating the reduction of other proteins. In comparison, the region that contains the greatest amount of variability between GST classes is contained in the alpha-2 helix on the C-terminal domain. The predominantly alpha-helical C-terminal domain is involved with the binding of hydrophobic substrates (such as hydrophobic portions of xenobiotics). The specificity of the alpha-2 helix stems from the assortment of amino acids in the domain that interacts with the glycine residue of glutathione.  Functions  Bacterial glutathione transferases are specific to aerobic bacteria and mainly function in the detoxification of exogenous compounds and the relief of oxidative stress.  Role in protection against oxidative stress  Aerobic bacteria inevitably are prone to the formation of reactive oxygen species due to the nature of their respiration processes. Under normal conditions these ROS strive to maintain a dynamic balance; however, this balance can often be disrupted by biotic or abiotic stressors such as superoxide radicals, endogenous lipids, DNA hydroperoxides, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and hydroxy alkenals. Therefore, these susceptible organisms have intrinsic mechanisms to protect from oxidative damage; glutathione plays a key role in most of these antioxidant mechanisms. Once reduced, glutathione interacts with these reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. This interaction is catalyzed by GSTs and their involvement is vital for successful oxidation of glutathione. GSTs bind the ROS substrate at its hydrophobic alpha-helical C-terminal domain, as well as reduced glutathione to its glutathione-binding site on the N-terminal domain. These two domains are adjacent to each other on the enzyme, and together form the active site of the GST where the redox reaction occurs. Once both substrates are bound at the enzyme‚Äôs active site, the monomeric GST interacts with another substrate- bound GST monomer and catalyzes a disulphide bridge between the two glutathione molecules. This yields the active dimeric enzyme structure. The reactive oxygen species then donates one electron to a glutathione molecule, completing the oxidation-reduction reaction and rendering the it unable to perform oxidative damage to the cell. After completion of this reaction, glutathione reductase recycles oxidized glutathione back to the reduced form so that it again can be picked up by GSTs. This glutathione system acts as the major reduction-oxidation buffer in aerobic bacterial cells, contributing to the overall reduced cellular environment of the cytosol.  Role in detoxification of xenobiotic substances  One of the primary roles of bacterial glutathione transferases is to reduce the toxic effects of xenobiotics from the cell using the phase II system of detoxification metabolism. Xenobiotics are compounds foreign to the bacterium‚Äôs natural biochemistry, and phase II of their detoxification involves conjugating them to polar, soluble compounds that can be safely excreted from the cell. GSTs are essential in this process because they catalyze the nucleophilic attack of glutathione on various electrophilic residues of xenobiotic substrates, thereby preventing their disruption of vital cellular proteins and nucleic acids. Similar to the mechanism GSTs use for catalyzation of redox reactions, the mechanism for detoxification first involves the binding of two substrates to the enzyme. A GST monomer binds a glutathione molecule to its N-terminal glutathione-binding site. On the adjacent hydrophobic alpha-helical binding site on the C-terminal domain, the GST binds a hydrophobic xenobiotic molecule. Formation of the active site recruits another GST monomer to interact with the system and the enzymes dimerize. The active GST complex catalyzes the -SH residue on glutathione to perform a nucleophilic attack on electrophilic carbon, sulfur, or nitrogen atoms of the xenobiotic substrate. The conjugation of glutathione on the previously hydrophobic-toxic substrate results in a soluble compound, which is more readily exocytosed by the cell.

For the part within the borders of the Midwestern United States, see North Woods. The Boreal forest and its alpine cousins are host to a wide variety of deer, ranging from the large moose (inset, right) to the whitetail deer. All of these large herbivores prefer the cool forest lest they overheat in the sun, but all need open land on which to graze. Of the deer, moose are perhaps best adapted to wetlands and thrive in the boggy boreal forest. The temperate conifer forests of the United States contain more than forty important cone-bearing forest tree species. These forests all have members of the taxonomic family called Pinaceae and most are commercially sought. However, some have uses outside the traditional forest product market. This massive softwood forest is spread over the entire North American continent and makes up the major portion of both trees and volume. There are five principal forest regions in North America that comprise the coniferous forest. The forests are equally spread geographically between east and west. Because of the forest's great size, and because of differing climate and soils, North America is favored by a rich variety of these \\"evergreens\\". This forest supports four times as many tree species as Europe does. The Pacific Coniferous Forest Region in United States This forest region runs along a thin strip of land for three thousand miles, from Kodiak Island in Alaska to the Santa Cruz Mountains near San Francisco is the Pacific Forest. This forest has the most prodigious growth of conifers unequalled anywhere on earth. A combination of temperature, rainfall, and topography creates conditions favorable for growing the largest living organisms - the inland sequoias and the coast redwoods . The Olympic rainforest of Washington supports dense stands of western hemlock, western red cedar, Sitka spruce, and Pacific silver and grand firs. Douglas fir is concentrated in Washington and Oregon. Alaska's predominate species is the western hemlock and Sitka spruce. The Rocky Mountain Coniferous Forest Region This Rocky Mountain forest region is more sparsely covered with trees. The most important trees here are ponderosa pine, western white pine, Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, and Engelmann's spruce. The use of fire in this region made it possible for big stands of lodgepole pine to take hold. In the sub-alpine zone of the mountains spruce and fir predominate, and they are succeeded near the timber line by larch, whitebark pine, limber pine and bristlecone pine. The bristlecone pine has been discovered to be the oldest living thing. The Northern Coniferous Forest Region This Northern forest region spreads across four thousand miles, from Alaska to Newfoundland and down the higher peaks of the Appalachian mountains. In the north woods, white and black spruce grow. The soil throughout the Northern Forest is generally poor. The most visible tree type in the region are conifers. The most prevalent conifers are balsam fir, eastern hemlock, northern white cedar, and eastern white pine . This northern region supplied much of the lumber used in the first 250 years of settlement in the United States. The Central Coniferous Forest Region The Central forest region touches 30 states from Cape Cod to the Rio Grande and back up to Canada. This forest is mostly deciduous which means that is green in the summer and bare in the winter. Although the main component is hardwood, there are several important softwoods. Eastern white pine and Virginia pine are common throughout the forest. The Southern Coniferous Forest Region The Southern forest occupies the coastal plains of the Atlantic from Virginia through the Gulf States and into Texas and Missouri. It is generally a forest created from abandoned old fields - many of which grew cotton. y See also * Boreal forest of Canada References Category:Forests of Canada Category:Forests of the United States ","title":"Northwoods (forest)"},{"id":"26135801","text":"United Nations Security Council resolution 649, adopted unanimously on 12 March 1990, after noting a report of the Secretary-General on a recent meeting between the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus and recalling Resolution 367 (1975), the Council expressed its regret that, in the 25 years since the establishment of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, a solution to the situation has not been found.

Early life Archer was born in Fauquier County, Virginia on December 13, 1790 to Major Peter Field Archer and Frances Tanner. He attended the College of William and Mary and received his medical degree in 1808 from the University of Pennsylvania. Archer married Eloisa Clarke on January 20, 1813; their union produced six children. Archer practiced medicine and was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates representing Powhatan County from 1819‚Äì1820. Archer was elected as a presidential elector in the 1820 United States presidential election, casting his vote for Virginia's native son, James Monroe (Democratic-Republican). On May 13, 1828, Archer killed his cousin, Dr. James Ottway Crump, in a duel fought with pistols near Scottsville, Virginia, in Powhatan County. In service to Texas Archer arrived in Texas about 1831, residing in Brazoria County. Archer was an active Mason and helped organize a Masonic Lodge in Brazoria. He was also an outspoken advocate of Texas' independence from Mexico and was elected to represent Brazoria at the Convention of 1833. In October 1835, Archer fought at the Battle of Gonzales which ended in a Mexican withdrawal. The next month he was elected Chairman of the Consultation of 1835, meeting in San Felipe de Austin which formed a provisional government for Texas. Although Archer was a hard-liner in favor of independence, he acceded to the will of the majority which voted to support a return to the Mexican Constitution of 1824. The Consultation subsequently elected Archer, along with Stephen F. Austin and William H. Wharton to serve as Commissioners of Texas in the United States. Their purpose was to raise funds, recruit troops and gain support among Americans for the cause of Texas. The trio sailed from Galveston to New Orleans in late December 1835 and moved up the Mississippi River over the next several weeks making speeches to crowds before moving east to Washington, D.C.. While the Commissioners were in Washington, on March 2, 1836, Texas declared its independence from Mexico. The United States refused to recognize the nascent republic at that point. Archer returned to Texas and was elected to the Texas House of Representatives representing Brazoria. He also supported the election of his former colleague Austin to be President of Texas. Austin died before the election was held and Sam Houston was elected President. In 1837, during the Second Session of the First Congress, Archer was elected Speaker of the Texas House. While in Congress, Archer joined James Collinsworth in sponsoring legislation to set up the Texas Railroad, Navigation, and Banking Company. Even though President Houston supported the establishment of the company, it later failed primarily due to its banking provisions and because of public opposition led by President Anson Jones. In 1838 ‚Äì 1839, Archer achieved the position of Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Texas. During the Administration of President Mirabeau B. Lamar, Archer was chosen to serve as Secretary of War from February 1840 until December 13, 1841. Final years Archer remained politically active throughout his life. He died on September 22, 1856, at Brazoria and was buried at William H. Wharton's Eagle Island Plantation on Oyster Creek in Brazoria County. Archer City and Archer County, Texas, the brig Archer of the Second Texas Navy were all named in his honor.

Known primarily for their multimedia performances, music recordings, and film works, the group's creative work expresses an underlying philosophy of personal, spiritual, and political liberation based on independent thinking and enlightened individualism. Early years The group formed in the film department of the Penn State University when Caeser Pink brought together a collection of film students to create a live multimedia presentation. The original collaborators were David Paterson, Michael Abrams, Louis Terrier, Samantha Delp, Lynn Anne Verbeck, and Ron Aurand. The performance was a free form mix of music, dance, video art projections, theatre, performance art, humor, and costuming. Once the project was ready for presentation the group could not find a theatre willing to allow them to present the performance. Instead The Imperial Orgy was presented in a night club that normally featured local cover bands. Imperial Orgy circa 1994 The themes explored in the performance included anti-establishment politics, alternative spiritual concepts, and personal and sexual liberation. The reaction to the performance was extreme, split between those who loved and those who hated the message presented. Quickly the group became the center of controversy as they repeated the performance at various venues in the area of the Penn State University. Performances were cancelled due to protests and threats of violence from religious organizations,Lewistown Sentinel 1994 their event posters were banned from the university causing a freedom of speech fight championed by the student newspaper,The Daily Collegian 1994Daily Collegian 1994Daily Collegian 1994letter to editor 1994 and women's studies classes debated the group's presentations of sexuality.Patriot News 1994Centre Daily Times New York years Imperial Orgy circa 1998 In 1995 the core group, minus Ron Aurand moved to New York City. During the move creative differences led to a succession of personnel changes and a period of relative inactivity. By 1997 The Imperial Orgy had regrouped with a larger community that included costume designers, choreographers, filmmakers, and a core line-up of Caeser Pink, Eric Mauriello, Tony Dilullo, Joyce Isabelle, Louis Terrier, Samantha Delp, and Lynn Anne Verbeck. This began a flurry of activity that included performances at some of New York City's best venues, the production of a cable TV series,Imperial Orgy TV Show the creation of innovative websites, art exhibitions, fashion shows, poetry readings, multi-artist music concerts, political salon debates, and music recordings. Reaction to The Imperial Orgy was mixed and seemingly confused. Major record labels courted the group but were rejected because they wished to turn the group into a traditional rock band for marketing purposes. The group landed on the cover of international publications such as .Net Magazine, Gig Magazine, and Mac Today Magazine. Their television series was syndicated in many cities across the U.S. and in France, Netherlands, and Australia. This period of activity climaxed with the production of a giant counter-culture masquerade ball at Webster Hall, a four- story theatre/night club in New York's East Village.London Observer 2002New York Observer 2002 New millennium Performance piece titled Frozen Performance piece titled I Am A Murderer By the beginning of the millennium, The Imperial Orgy had expanded to become a large collective with hundreds of collaborators. Their multimedia performances featured a rotating cast of dozens of musicians, actors, dancers, performance artists, filmmakers, costume designers, choreographers, and tech designers. Among the notable collaborators are: * Drummer, vibraphonist, and classical composer Frank Picarazzi * Drummer Ron Wilson (Lou Christie) * Actress and singer Erica Mansfield (A Chorus Line, Mamma Mia!) * Actress and singer Jen Oda (The Hirosaki Players, Royal Pains, Spider-Man 3, Back Stab) * Singer, songwriter, and bassist Bonnie Bowers Bonnie Bowers * Dancer, actress and singer Ivette Oliveras * Actress and singer Agelica Lee Aspiras (Spelling Bee) Spelling Bee Musical * Singer and dancer Talia Wright * Saxophonist Kim Bock (Kim Bock Quartet) Kim Bock Official Website * Fashion designer Vilma MareVilma Mare Website * Fashion designers Gaelyn & CianfaraniOfficial Website * Fashion designer Garo SparoOfficial Website * Photographer Anthony LeporeOfficial Website * Photographer John KolesaOfficial Website * Guitarist Reeves Gabrels * Photographer Matthew Seigelbaum * Performance artist Amber RayOfficial Website * Actress Vanessa Del Rio * Artist Ademola Olugebefola Legacy Of A Living Artist Performance piece titled Struggle The Void Shortly after 9/11 The Imperial Orgy began two years of inactivity. Caeser Pink worked at Ground Zero in the months after 9/11 and traveled across the United States by car while writing the book \\"Murder Of The Holly King\\" which chronicled the experience of exploring America in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. In 2003 the group founded a non-profit organization the Arete Living Arts Foundation to fund artist projects and develop innovative artists. In 2004 Caeser Pink returned to his economically and socially troubled hometown, Lewistown, Pennsylvania for a year where he utilized the non-profit organization to offer free computer classes in video editing, web design, and graphic design. In 2006 The Imperial Orgy released a music CD titled Gospel Hymns For Agnostics And Atheists,Clarkson IntegratorOnline RockThe Contraband and in 2007 a second CD titled All God's Children.The Maine CampusThe RotundaThe Royal Purple Both CDs caused controversy due to their lyrical content.The Oracle The recordings were banned from many college radio stations, and the unusual nature of the music and themes brought a wave of press coverage from college newspapers and regional press outlets. Among the issues that caused controversy was Pink's message against religious intolerance and his promotion of spirituality that transcends denominations. On April 5, 2010 The Imperial Orgy blasted into outer space when Stephanie Wilson, an astronaut aboard the Discovery space shuttle took the group's All God's Children CD into orbit for the listening pleasures of the international space station. The seven-member crew aboard Discovery were on a 13-day mission carrying supplies and science equipment for the space station.

The character was created by Peter B. Gillis and Brent Anderson. Publication history Radian (Louis Armanetti) was created by writer Peter B. Gillis and artist Brent Anderson and debuted in Strikeforce: Morituri #1 (December 1986). The codename \\"Radian\\" was introduced in issue #2. Radian remained in the regular cast of the book until his death in Strikeforce: Morituri #15. Fictional character biography Virtually nothing is known of Louis Armanetti's life, prior to his decision to join the Strikeforce: Morituri. A jokester and quick to mask his insecurities and fears behind jokes, in 2073, Armanetti volunteered for the Morituri process, a revolutionary scientific progress which gifts ordinary people with superhuman abilities. Armanetti was found genetically compatible for the process, one of only a handful among thousands of applicants. However, the recipients gained their powers at a terrible price: a fatal flaw in the process which ensures their death within a year of receiving it. The objective of this process was the formation of a team of superpowered beings which could be utilized as Earth's combatants in Earth's ongoing war against the savage alien race known as the Horde. Despite his knowledge of certain death within a year, Armanetti underwent the process, and became part of the first official generation of Strikeforce: Morituri. After all members of the Morituri had successfully underwent the process, they were dispatched to the Biowar Zone Alpha (nicknamed \\"the Garden\\"), a specially designed facility filled with several dangerous traps. The objective of this test was to have their superhuman powers manifest under great pressure, instead of waiting for months. The only member who did not undertake the \\"Garden\\" treatment was Blackthorn whose powers had already surfaced naturally. Armanetti exhibited extreme self-confidence upon entering the Garden. However, he was quickly paralyzed by a nerve gas. His confidence was crushed, as he began realizing he might die and burn in Hell eternally, as a punishment for not being religious all these years. The shock of the experience unlocked his ability to emit electromagnetic radiation blasts and he managed to set himself free by burning the gas toxins in his body. Subsequently, he took on the nom de guerre \\"Radian\\" and designed a costume with special sleeves, which helped him focus his blasts more effectively. Radian soon participated in the first official battle of Strikeforce: Morituri, which took place in Kramatorsk, Soviet Union. During the battle, he realized that his powers were even more effective when combined with the plasma blasts released by his teammate, Snapdragon. The two paired up in battles, utilizing their powers in unison, until Snapdragon died of the Morituri effect. Radian was the first team member to show visible concern over their lives being thrown away. After Vyking's death in a spaceship en route to the Horde fleet, Radian was the only one to oppose the idea of continuing with their mission, although he complied when the team decided to keep on. Nevertheless, the team succeeded in its mission. Hope for a cure Following Vyking's demise, Radian, who was used to taking orders in battle, began looking for another leader figure and tried to pressure his new teammate, Toxyn, into this position, much against her chagrin. Later, during a battle with the Horde, one of them managed to slip a videocassette in Radian's costume. Radian was unaware of it until he returned to the Morituri base. In his room, Radian watched the cassette alone. Through the cassette, the Kind Inquirer of the Horde made Radian a tempting offer: he professed possessing a cure for the deadly Morituri effect. As proof, the Horde warlord produced Bruce Higashi, a member of the Black Watch, the first team of volunteers to undergo the process. Higashi had been believed killed in the first and only battle of the Watch that had taken place months ago. In the video, though, Higashi appeared to be still alive, albeit a captive of the Horde, approximately sixteen months after he had been subjected to the Morituri process, meaning he had long outlived the time limit of the deadly effect. Radian was torn between his devotion to the team, and his desire to evade the certain death that awaited him, which to him equalled suicide. That same day, teammate Scaredycat presented him with a communication she had intercepted, which proved that the team's employers, the Paedia Council, were discouraging Dr. Kimmo Tuolema, inventor of the process, from searching for a cure for the Morituri effect. An indignant Radian made up his mind and called the number that the Horde had left him on the cassette. The team privately discussed Scaredycat's finding and pondered on their options. However, despite their anger for being treated as expendable pawns, they all seemed to brush it off, with the exception of Radian. More and more troubled, Radian again communicated with the Horde and made an agreement with them. Negotiations with the Horde Just then, the team was alerted by yet another alarm about a Horde attack. Even though the team was not officially called to action, due to the limited size of the attack, Radian took the initiative and led the team to a cruise ship that had been taken over by the Horde. Apparently, Vyking's parents were on board as passengers and the Horde took them hostage, hoping to lure the team, knowing they would not refrain from helping their dead leader's parents. The team prevailed in the ensuing battle and took over the Horde ship that had realized the attack. However, just then, Radian communicated with the other Horde ships that participated in the attack, and pretended to go along with their agreed plan of delivering all the team into their hands. The team lashed at him, but Radian, either accidentally or on purpose, drove the commandeered ship in space, thus breaking his deal with the Hordians. Nevertheless, the team accused Radian of being a traitor. It was only after Radian claimed that he had done all this in order for them to commandeer a Horde ship and for their teammate, Adept, to come in contact again with invaluable artifact stashed in their space fleet and catalogue them in her memories through her analytic abilities, that they were convinced of his good intentions. After the success of the mission, the team returned to Earth, now facing charges of misconduct. Eventually, the team was acquitted. Betrayal However, Radian still faced the same ethical dilemma of whether his death of the Morituri effect equalled suicide and whether he should pursue a possible cure that could save all the Morituri's lives, including the life of Blackthorn's unborn baby. He even visited a nun, asking for enlightenment, but she assured him that his death as Earth's hero did not signify suicide. Radian then visited Dr. Kimmo Tuolema, the inventor of the process and asked him if a cure was likely to be found. Tuolema dashed his hopes, revealing that one of his colleagues, who was vital in the research for the cure, was kidnapped years ago by the Horde and possibly killed by them, making the prospect of a cure in the near future highly unlikely. After that, Radian contemplated that the Horde's story of possessing the cure could be true. Shortly afterwards, the team faced the Super-Hordians, a genetically mutated breed of more powerful Hordians. The team was almost vanquished by them, before Radian decided to turn himself over to the Super-Hordians, allowing himself to be led to their leader. Radian was taken in the Horde's Earthbound base, in Cape Town, where the Kind Inquirer presented Radian with the captive Bruce Higashi, reiterating his claims about a cure. Higashi tried to discourage Radian, arguing that what he was suffering now was worse than death, but the Kind Inquirer did not allow him to continue his communication with the Morituri. Radian then asked the Horde warlord if they had procured the cure from Tuolema's colleague, Dr. Ledbetter, which the Kind Inquirer confirmed. He also informed Radian that they would not hold him captive, but he still had to pay a price. Indeed, Radian was forced to transmit a message throughout the globe, in which he informed the public that there is, in fact, a cure for the Morituri effect, but the Paedia refrains from discovering it, wanting to keep their superpowered warriors under check. He also publicly denounced the Paedia and its actions. Death Shortly afterwards, Radian was returned to Earth and confronted his teammates. They all lashed at him for his perceived betrayal and one of them, the aggressive Shear, mortally wounded him. As he lay dying, Radian confessed to Blackthorn, by then his closest confidant, that there is no cure and the Horde were lying. Apparently, a \\"Dr. Ledbetter\\" doesn't exist and Radian called in their bluff. He also explained that his purpose, to die in battle instead of \\"committing suicide\\" (i.e. dying of the Morituri effect) had been achieved. Blackthorn forgave him. After Radian died, Shear proceeded to spit on his face. Powers and abilities Radian had the ability to emit E-M radiation across the whole spectrum, from radio lines to low level gamma rays, to various effects. He had \\"focusing sleeves\\" in his uniform which helped him focus his blasts in battle more effectively. However, during his lifetime, he never achieved coherence, i.e. lasing. Besides the aggressive use of his power, he was seen utilizing his radiation control in different ways, such as burning the nerve toxins in his body, emitting blasts with carrier waves or producing a viable phone signal. As a result of his exposure to the Morituri process, he also had enhanced strength and resilience. Like all Morituri, he also wore special boots which enabled him to fly.

M. Keck Observatory in 2010. The planet is found in an M type dwarf star catalogued as HIP 79431 and is located within the Scorpius constellation approximately 47 light years away from the Earth. Its orbital period lasts about 111.7 days and has an orbital eccentricity of 0.29. The planet is the 6th giant planet to be detected in the Doppler surveys of M dwarfs and is considered to be one of the most massive planets found around M dwarf stars. The planet HIP 79431 b is named Barajeel. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by the United Arab Emirates, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. A barajeel is a wind tower used to direct the flow of the wind so that air can be recirculated as a form of air conditioning. Observations HIP 79431 b is located in orbit around a star whose metallicity had been challenging to be assessed due to the uncertainties within the molecular data line, however it has not been typical for M Dwarfs to have strong emissions from the core data lines. This led to the inclusion of the HIP 79431 star to the KECK program in April 2009 as part of the exoplanet studies for low mass stars. During this study, 13 Doppler measurements of the star were done over a 6-month period using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES). The exposure times used in its observation was 600 seconds which yielded a signal-to-noise ratio of just under 100. Each program observation required the use of iodine absorption lines in order to model the wavelength scale as well as the instrumental profile of the telescope and spectrometer optics. The Doppler experiments derived radial velocities fit the Keplerian model showing an unambiguous signal and orbital parameters which best fit planetary gravitational pull, this revealed the presence of the planet HIP 79431 b. However, there is no evidence that any additional planets was found. Low transit possibility The planet HIP 79431 b has a low transit probability mainly due to its semi- major axis orientation. Another observation with regard to its eccentricity orbit is that it brings the planet closer to its star periastron increasing the probability of a transit, which was estimated as a meager 0.5%. According to the KECK program, if a transit would occur, the depth would be remarkable mainly due to the calculated mass of the planet.

Unlike podcasting, which is a series of digital media files (either audio or video) that are typically downloaded through web syndication, personalcasting automatically indexes, clusters and extracts information from news sources. Application With personalcasting technology, users can create complex queries combining keywords, named entities (e.g., people, organizations, and places), sources (e.g., CNN, MSNBC, ABC) or time intervals (e.g., specific days, weeks or years). These queries result in selected video stories specific to user interest . Conversely, there are companies that offer personalcasting services directly to news outlets - allowing the organizations to create customized, around-the-clock programs for listeners. By personalizing the selection of stories and the platforms from which they are delivered, users are afforded a more individual and enhanced news experience based on their predilections. This is an especially beneficial application for people wanting to listen to personalized information during their commutes to and from work. According to a U.S. Census Bureau analysis, driving to work was the favored means of commute of nearly nine out of 10 American workers (87.7 percent), with most people (77 percent) driving alone. In addition, algorithms can be created to follow a user‚Äôs personalcast sessions to capture user interest. The system can then automatically broaden a user‚Äôs queries and selections to include additional content based on preferences. Personalcasting technology was developed by a community of scientists and individual technology companies during the late 1990s and early 2000s as a way to provide more convenient access to broadcast news. Earlier systems required content to be manually annotated. However, more recent systems automatically extract information from a variety of news sources. History The first known reference to personalcasting was in 1999 by a technology company named VoicePress. Shortly thereafter, Mark T. Maybury, editor of Intelligent Multimedia InterfacesIntelligent Multimedia Interfaces(AAAI/MIT Press 1993) and Intelligent Multimedia Information RetrievalIntelligent Multimedia Information Retrieval (AAAI/ MIT Press 1997) used the term personalcasting at an international conference on user modeling in Germany and he also included the term in several research papers.Maybury, M. T., Personalcasting: Tailored Broadcast News. 2001, Workshop on Personalized Television. International Conference on User Modeling. Sondhofen, Germany In Japan, Sony applied this concept to television programming in 2000, launching a site called PercasTV that provides live personal video distribution service on the Internet. Building upon content based news understanding algorithms that simultaneously analyzed multiple media streams (e.g., audio, video, textual), a personalization system that automatically generated both content and media tailored to individual queries and preferences was invented to personalize broadcast news.

Contents The two booklet set describes Nehwon and the city of Lankhmar, from Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser series. It includes information on the city's districts, factions and guilds, characters, and the gods and monsters of Nehwon, as well as encounter tables and adventure ideas. The larger book begins by detailing summaries of the Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser stories, and provides comments on the stories' potential for further adventures. Next is a district-by-district breakdown of Lankhmar, with detailed maps that mark and describe 99 locations, as well as record sheets for the Dungeon Master's (DM's) campaign notes. Another annotated map details the world of Nehwon, followed by descriptions of almost 100 non-player characters (NPCs), including statistics for Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser in Legends & Lore format; the gods and monsters of Nehwon are also presented, adding to those already appearing in Legends & Lore. The book goes on to describe the workings of the city, including details on its political factions, guilds, and religions, as well as a chapter on adventuring in Lankhmar with rules on haggling, bribery, the legal system, and Social Levels. There is also a section on generating new NPCs and buildings, which includes sample building plans. The book also includes a series of conversion rules for fitting the setting into the AD&D; game system. There is a series of set-piece encounters for providing random incidents, or even starting points for adventures, as well as a scenario for 9th-12th level adventurers titled \\"The Karvian Elephant\\". The color map includes a number of areas in grey, which the DM can design. The map of Lankhmar depicts a crowded city with roads and alleys winding around the houses; in the middle of each city block is a large blank area that represents the narrow backstreets of Lankhmar, those areas about which the casual passer- by knows nothing. It is only after leaving the main streets and venturing into the inner areas of Lankhmar that these areas become known to the player characters (PCs). The smaller booklet contains a series of city block geomorphs which can also be used to fill in the blank areas on the map. Whenever the PCs venture into the backstreets, the GM selects one of 12 geomorphs to fill the empty area, and each geomorph shows the layout of buildings in the backstreets. The smaller booklet also contains record sheets, duplicate maps, and other information for players. Publication history Lankhmar ‚Äì City of Adventure was designed by Bruce Nesmith, Douglas Niles, and Ken Rolston, with a cover by Keith Parkinson and interior illustrations by Jeff Easley, and was first published by TSR for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game system in 1985 as a 96-page book with a back cover pocket, a 32-page districts book with record sheets, handouts, and pre-generated characters from the stories for players, and a poster-size, full-color map of the city of Lankhmar. Additional research was by Steve Mecca, and editing was by Anne Gray McCready and Barbara Green Deer. The set was updated in 1993 under the same name for use with second edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. Reception Graeme Davis reviewed Lankhmar ‚Äì City of Adventure for White Dwarf, and gave it 10/10 overall. Davis notes that the Social Levels rule \\"makes a valuable addition to the AD&D; game rules\\", and the sample building plans are \\"useful in any context‚ÄîLankhmar or otherwise\\". Davis was concerned whether the AD&D; game system \\"could fit a pre-existing, detailed fictional setting without the obvious strain that showed in the Conan AD&D; modules\\", but said the chapter on conversion rules eased his fears, continuing: \\"There is a little spanner-work necessary, especially with spellcasters, but the adjustments work surprisingly well once you get used to them, and little or none of the flavour of the original setting is lost.\\" He called the adjustments in the accessory \\"forgivable\\" and \\"necessary\\" and the color map \\"a thing of beauty\\". He recommended the book to both fans of the stories and fans of AD&D;, and concluded the review by calling Lankhmar \\"a delight\\", \\"simply the best city module ever to see print\\", and \\"a beauty.\\" Jim Bambra reviewed Lankhmar City of Adventure for Dragon magazine No. 136 (August 1988). Bambra felt that the set described \\"a city that is full of atmosphere and has a distinctive character\\", but cautioned that \\"Lankhmar‚Äôs character is also one of its weaknesses, as the city is very closely tied to the world and characters created by novelist Fritz Leiber,\\" which would make it hard to fit this supplement into a more conventional AD&D; game setting. Bambra described it further: \\"It's a living and breathing city, a place where Leiber‚Äôs heroes Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser can really feel at home. [...] The supplement's designers have done an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere of the city; you can almost smell the smoke and stench as you read through the supplement's main book.\\" Bambra felt that the Lankhmar pack is all about the opportunity for a game master to create a city in as much detail as desired, and that the pack contains enough background to make designing a city really easy. Bambra pointed out omissions that he considered minor annoyances: \\"There is no Rainbow Palace flow chart for conducting fights and chases in the palace, no Nehwon wandering monster encounter chart (although this is referenced twice in the book), and no new spells that were promised for spell-casters.\\" Bambra called the book \\"easily one of the best city supplements ever published\\" but also \\"limited in its use\\", saying the game has to be played in Leiber's world to get the full effect, calling it \\"unique but narrow in scope\\". He concluded his review by saying, \\"So, we have an excellent city pack that doesn't fit very easily into mainstream AD&D; game play‚Äî-a situation that tends to mark the Lankhmar pack as an inspirational reference work rather than a living and breathing city. This is, of course, unless you‚Äôre a big Leiber fan who enjoys thief- and fighter-oriented adventures; in this case, Lankhmar is a dream come true.\\" Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, calls the set \\"Easily one of the best campaign settings for AD&D;, it's designed so that each GM who uses it will create an individualized Lankhmar by selecting detail maps and locations to suit.\\" References Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks Category:Nehwon Category:Role-playing games based on novels ","title":"Lankhmar ‚Äì City of Adventure"},{"id":"26136309","text":"Ognjen Kr≈æiƒá (born 13 March 1969) is a water polo player from Croatia, who was a member of the national team that won the silver medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia.

Its architecture was not changed from the original for almost half a century, and was repainted from yellow to red. A petroleum lamp was installed in 1909, later with acetylene until 1936. Like many other lighthouses in Italy, this lighthouse was severely damaged during World War II, and the extensive damage was repaired between 1947 and 1948. In 1949 it was electrified. Description The lighthouse is a circular 25 metres high masonry tower and the diameter of the lantern is 3.82 metres. It is reached by a staircase of 74 steps. Adjacent to the tower is a three-story brick building. The lighthouse is still manned and is managed by the Command Area Lighthouses Navy based in La Spezia (which incidentally takes care of all the lighthouses in the Tyrrhenian). The Marina Militare is responsible for managing all the lights on an approximate 8000 kilometers of Italian coastline since 1910, using both military and civilian technicians.

Users could share links, photos, videos, status messages and comments organized in \\"conversations\\" and visible in the user's inbox. On October 14, 2011, Google announced that it would discontinue the service and that the existing content would be available in read-only mode. Buzz was discontinued on December 15, 2011, and superseded by Google+ (which was later discontinued on April 2, 2019). Buzz enabled users to choose to share publicly with the world or privately to a group of friends each time they posted.Blog announcement , gmailblog.blogspot.com Picasa, Flickr, Google Latitude, Google Reader, Google Sidewiki, YouTube, Blogger, FriendFeed, identi.ca and Twitter were integrated. The creation of Buzz was seen by industry analysts as an attempt by Google to compete with social networking websites like Facebook and microblogging services like Twitter. Buzz also included several user interface elements from other Google products (e.g., Google Reader), such as the ability to \\"like\\" a post. Google executive Sergey Brin said that by offering social communications, Buzz would help bridge the gap between work and leisure, but the service was strongly criticized when it was introduced for insufficient attention to users' privacy. Platform In May 2010, Google revealed APIs for Buzz, expanding it to being a platform as well as a service. This allowed third-party developers to write software that would be able to both read and post content to Buzz. Several partners demonstrated integration via the new APIs, including Seesmic and Socialwok. Mobile versions When the service was accessed with a supported mobile device, Buzz tagged posts with the user's current location. Users were only permitted to use the actual physical location reported by the device for their Buzz posts; unlike the Google Latitude location-sharing service, Buzz did not allow users to manually specify an arbitrary location. The mobile version of Buzz integrated with Google Maps so users could see who was around them. Buzz posts made through Google Maps were public and could be seen by anybody else who was using the software. In addition to text, mobile users' posts were able to include an uploaded photo. Platforms supported were limited to devices running Android 1.6+, iOS, Windows Mobile, Openwave and S60. History Google Buzz was announced on February 9, 2010, in a press conference at the company's Mountain View headquarters and launched on the same day, at 11 a.m. PT for the first set of users. The feature, available from the Gmail inbox, was rolled out to Gmail accounts in the following weeks. A mobile version of the site optimized for Android phones and Apple's iPhone was also launched, while a version for businesses and schools that use Google Apps was only planned. Within 56 hours of its release, 9 million posts were made on Google Buzz ‚Äî approximately 160,000 posts and comments per hour. On October 14, 2011, Google announced that Google Buzz would be shut down together with the Buzz API \\"in a few weeks\\", in order to focus on Google+ instead. Bradley Horowitz, Google's Vice President, Product, explained the ramifications, \\"While people obviously won't be able to create new posts after that, they will be able to view their existing content on their Google Profile and download it using Google Takeout\\". He also said, \\"We learned a lot from products like Buzz and are putting that learning to work every day in our vision for products like Google+\\". It was discontinued on December 15, 2011 and all content users saved on the service were saved to the user's Google Drive. Google+ was shutdown on April 2, 2019. Google cited low user engagement and software security issues for the shutdown. Privacy At launch, Google's decision to opt-in its user base with weak privacy settings caused a breach of user information and garnered significant criticism. One feature in particular that was widely criticized as a severe privacy flaw was that by default Google Buzz publicly disclosed (on the user's Google profile) a list of the names of Gmail contacts that the user has most frequently emailed or chatted with. Users who failed to disable this feature (or did not realize that they had to) could have sensitive information about themselves and their contacts revealed. This was later adjusted so that users had to explicitly add information that they want public. Google Profiles existed before Buzz and could be set by the user to be public or not. After Buzz was released, the last name field was required to be non empty and profiles set not to be indexed became indexed for a profile search. A 2010 New York Times article characterized Google as being \\"known for releasing new products before they are fully ready and then improving them over time\\". Google twice tried to address privacy concerns: first by making the option to disable public sharing of contact lists more prominent and later by changing one of Buzz's features from \\"auto-follow\\" to \\"auto-suggest\\". This allowed users complete control over whom they follow and, therefore, who was revealed on their public list of contacts. These changes to the way that Google Buzz operates were, however, criticized as inadequate and the company was criticized for failing to take its users' privacy concerns seriously. Among other initial problems, users who had never created a Google profile had no way to make their list of contacts or other information private, which resulted in negative publicity from a case involving information about a woman's current workplace and partner being shared with her abusive ex- husband. Concerns were also raised that because the mobile version of Google Buzz by default published the user's exact location when they posted a message to the service, users might unintentionally reveal sensitive locations. Legal issues On February 16, 2010, Eva Hibnick, a student at Harvard Law School, filed a class action lawsuit against Google, alleging that Buzz violated several federal laws meant to protect privacy. On the same day, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission alleging that Google Buzz \\"violated user expectations, diminished user privacy, contradicted Google's privacy policy, and may have violated federal wiretap laws\\". Also on February 16, 2010, the Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote \\"These problems arose because Google attempted to overcome its market disadvantage in competing with Twitter and Facebook by making a secondary use of your information. Google leveraged information gathered in a popular service (Gmail) with a new service (Buzz) and set a default to sharing your email contacts to maximize uptake of the service. In the process, the privacy of Google users was overlooked and ultimately compromised.\\" On February 17, 2010, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, Jennifer Stoddart, issued a statement on Buzz: On November 2, 2010, Google e‚Äëmailed Gmail users to tell them about the outcome of the lawsuit. As part of its settlement, Google agreed to create an $8.5 million fund to award money to groups that promote privacy education on the web, of which the prosecuting lawyers are requesting 25% ($2,125,000) \\"plus reimbursement of costs and expenses\\". The settlement was finally approved in June 2011. On March 30, 2011, the Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement with Google regarding Buzz. In the announcement, the FTC agreed with the EPIC complaint that Google had violated its privacy policies by using information provided for Gmail for another purpose - social networking - without obtaining consumers‚Äô permission in advance. The FTC also alleged that Google misrepresented that it was treating personal information from the European Union in accordance with the US-EU Safe Harbor privacy framework. The FTC stated that \\"The proposed settlement bars the company from future privacy misrepresentations, requires it to implement a comprehensive privacy program and calls for regular, independent privacy audits for the next 20 years.\\" In response to the announcement that Google agreed to adopt a \\"Comprehensive Privacy Plan\\", EPIC launched a campaign, called \\"Fix Google Privacy\\", to encourage Internet users to offer their suggestions to improve safeguards for Google's products and services. Subsequently, in United States v. Google Inc., the FTC alleged that Google had violated this settlement agreement by misrepresenting privacy assurances to users of Apple's Safari Internet browser. Reception Both the general and technical press were critical of Buzz and the manner in which it was implemented. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation described Buzz's arrival as having \\"ignited a hailstorm of criticism\\". CBC indicated \\"One user blogged about how Buzz automatically added her abusive ex-boyfriend as a follower and exposed her communications with a current partner to him. Other bloggers commented that repressive governments in countries such as China or Iran could use Buzz to expose dissidents\\". PCWorld‚Äôs JR Raphael criticized Buzz for both its intrusive nature and privacy concerns, citing above all that it merely adds \\"more noise into an already buzzing area of my life\\". Raphael provided a tutorial on how to disable Buzz. Ryan Paul of Ars Technica noted \\"there isn't much in Buzz that is new or original\\" and \\"the end result is a service that shows promise but lacks the requisite killer feature or innovative twist that it will need in order to truly keep people engaged\\".

Miller (born 1956) is an American paleoconservative political activist, independent film director, writer, and producer. His works include the television film A Place to Grow (1998), starring Gary Morris, and the film Jericho (2000), starring Mark Valley. During the 2000s he founded a Tennessee- based production company, Americana Pictures. He has also written articles for the Barnes Review and the Occidental Observer. Miller was the 2012 presidential nominee of the white nationalist American Third Position Party (now known as the American Freedom Party).Winger, Richard (January 17, 2012) \\"American Third Position Nomines its First National Ticket\\", Ballot Access News. Retrieved January 19, 2012. Academic and political activist Virginia Abernethy was his running-mate. Early years Miller was born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1956 and was also raised there. He states that he worked as an Industrial engineering manager for Michelin Tire Company. Miller says that in his childhood, he admired Walt Disney and Davy Crockett. Career Miller produced and edited Devil Rider (1989), a horror movie starring Tag Groat as the title character. In 1991, Miller produced David Heavener's crime film Prime Target, starring Heavener as policeman John Bloodstone and Isaac Hayes as Captain Tompkins. Miller co-produced the action film A Mission to Kill (1992), starring William Smith as a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran, Boris Catuli. Tag Groat, who played the title role in Devil Rider, also appeared in this film. Miller returned to film making with A Place to Grow (1998), which he wrote, directed, and produced. The movie starred country singer Gary Morris; actors John Beck and Wilford Brimley, as well as hobo music artist Boxcar Willie, also appeared in it. > Miller produced and directed a western movie, Jericho (2000), with Mark Valley as the title character. Retired Marine Corps drill instructor R. Lee Ermey appeared in the movie, as did Buck Taylor and country artist Lisa Stewart. Miller's shift in ideology led him to found Americana Pictures, based in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, Miller's current home. According to its mission statement, the company aims \\"to develop, produce and market quality motion pictures, which promote fresh talent and the best of traditional European-American ideals.\\" Americana Pictures' first film was said to be about the USS Liberty incident, which he referred to as a \\"shocking Israeli attack\\" on the United States. He said he was planning to produce The Liberator (which was to be based on the history of Arminius and the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest). He wrote a favorable review of the Martin Campbell movie Edge of Darkness. Ideology During the 2000s, Miller began to take on an increasingly paleoconservative political stance. He also became harshly critical of Hollywood, claiming that it \\"surreptitiously seeks to destroy our European-American heritage and our Christian-based traditional values, and replace them with values that debase these traditional values and elevate minorities as paragons of virtue and wisdom.... Today's motion pictures, in concert with other forms of mass media entertainment, are the greatest enemies to the well-being of our progeny and the future of our country.\\" Miller has also accused Hollywood of being under \\"Jewish-Zionist control\\"; he cites Kevin B. MacDonald as influencing this belief. He has criticized celebrities such as Quentin Tarantino and Madonna, saying that they are \\"dysfunctional\\" and \\"come from traditional Christian or European-American backgrounds but are notorious for spurning those values.\\" He has cited Mel Gibson and his self-marketed movie The Passion of the Christ as inspirations. Miller also spoke at the 2008 national conference of the Council of Conservative Citizens, of which he is also a member. Miller has stated that while he does not share all the goals of the COfCC members, and rejects \\"extremist stances\\", he nonetheless agrees with the group's statement of principles. Miller states that he \\"doesn't like\\" interracial marriage but that he does not support outlawing interracial marriage. Miller has denied being antisemitic, instead claiming that he merely opposes \\"favoritism\\" granted to Jews in the film industry. He also opposes illegal immigration and what he refers to as \\"wide open borders\\" in the United States. Miller was a noted participant in the International Conference on Hollywoodism in Iran. After his return from Iran in 2012, he wrote on his website that he realized that the people who wanted a war between the US and Iran are \\"globalists (international bankers and their multinational beneficiaries). They control Israel, the American media and most of our politicians‚Ä¶and by extension our foreign policy.\\" Political activities In 2008, Miller contributed $200 to the presidential campaign of Republican Congressman Ron Paul. He also served as a delegate for Paul's campaign. In January 2012, Miller was nominated by the American Third Position Party (later known as the American Freedom Party) for President of the United States in the 2012 election. He was the party's first presidential candidate nominee after its foundation in 2010.\\"American Third Position Party nominates presidential ticket\\", Independent Political Report. January 17, 2012.

In September 2012, Miller met with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmedinejad for nearly 20 minutes and discussed a number of issues, including what both Miller and Ahmedinejad characterize as the \\"Zionist-controlled media\\" in the West. Miller publicly defended Ahmedinejad as someone who has been unfairly demonized in Western media and who cares about his people. Ahmedinejad gave Miller a collection of poems by Omar Khayyam.

It was given in 1835 by Governor Jos√© Castro to Jos√© Antonio Galindo.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco The grant encompassed the area around Lake Merced in San Francisco and the present day Daly City neighborhoods of Westlake, and Serramonte.Dise√±o del Rancho Laguna de la Merced History Jos√© Galindo was a corporal in the Presidio of San Francisco militia in Alta California. His grandfather, Nicol√°s Galindo, had accompanied the De Anza Expedition as a settler in Las Californias province in 1776. In 1835, Jos√© Antonio Galindo was granted the one half square league Rancho Laguna de la Merced around Lake Merced, and also received the Rancho Saucelito grant, in Alta California. His widowed mother, Ramona Sanchez de Galindo, was the grantee of Rancho Butano in 1838. Jos√© Antonio Galindo did little to develop Rancho Laguna de la Merced and sold it in 1837 to Francisco de Haro (1792 - 1849). In a strange turn of events, in 1838, Alcalde De Haro arrested Jos√© Antonio Galindo for the murder of Jos√© Doroteo Peralta (1810 - 1838), son of Pedro Peralta. De Haro's wife, Emiliana Sanchez, died in 1842, and De Haro died in 1849. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Laguna de la Merced was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States. District Court (California : Northern District) Land Case 380 ND and the grant was patented in 1872 to the surviving De Haro children - Josefa de Haro Guerrero Denniston, Rosalia de Haro Andrews Brown, Natividad de Haro Castro Tissot, and Carlotta de Haro Denniston. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 The De Haro's tried to claim land in the between Lake Merced and San Bruno Mountain. An 1853 U.S. government survey declared that the contested area was in fact government property, and could be acquired by private citizens. There was a brief land rush as squatters arrived in anticipation of Congress passing the Homestead Act that would have given legal title to to anyone already present on the land. The Greene brothers arrived in California around 1847, and squatted on part of Rancho Laguna de la Merced. David Mahoney bought Rancho Laguna de La Merced and had another survey made. Mahoney sought to extend his property north to more desirable property and his survey included the Greenes‚Äô homestead. Major litigation followed. George Greene won in the US District Court, and Mahoney appealed to US Supreme Court.Mahoney vs Bergin,1871, Reports of cases determined in the Supreme Court of the State of California, Volume 41, pp 423-428, Bancroft-Whitney Company The Greenes lost their case. The Greenes refused to leave, and built a metal-lined fort to keep out the authorities. The Greenes remained holding the fort for three months until a special Act of Congress was passed in 1887 granting them the land. Robert S. Thornton established a claim south of Lake Merced. He was the representative of thirty property holders (\\"North San Mateo Settlers' Union\\") in the present day Colma area whose titles were in peril. In 1865 they won their case in the U.S. Supreme Court.Philip W. Alexander & Charles P. Hamm,1916, History of San Mateo County, page 190-192. Press of Burlingame Publishing Co., Burlingame, CA. The Spring Valley Water Company bought the water rights for Lake Merced in 1868, and in 1877 started buying the surrounding watershed.

In New Jersey, Lewis served on the board of the Bureau of Jewish Education of Camden, New Jersey, and as president of the Tri-County Board of Rabbis (TCBOR), a regional group representing Camden, Burlington, and Gloucester counties, composed of rabbis from all movements within Judaism. Together with Rabbi Max Weine, he founded two educational programs that brought together children and young adults from many of the local synagogues: the Inter- Congregation Hebrew High School (ICHHS), and Midrashah, continuing religious education classes for graduates of the ICHHS. Both of these programs continue as collaborative efforts involving a number of rabbis, cantors, and teachers throughout the region, with classes meeting at participating synagogues and other Jewish institutions, helping to strengthen and foster cooperation and closer ties within the larger Jewish community. He was also a strong voice in interfaith affairs, maintaining close ties with the Catholic Diocese of Camden, and pioneering outreach efforts to local church and religious groups, welcoming visiting classes into the synagogue, to learn more about Judaism.Many of these meetings are mentioned in the synagogue bulletins reprinted in his book, So It Isn't Perfect. For example, on pages 14-15, he writes about a synagogue visit by a group of Mennonites, followed by his a lunch conversation with the group's leader. In other bulletin articles, he shares instances with the congregation when he learned from Monsignor McCloskey, \\"the priest across the street,\\" (p.99), and (pg.57) the fact that it was at an affair honoring Catholic Archbishop Damiano that he learned an important quote from a speaker, Monseignor Adamo, about a Jew(!) -- Albert Einstein: \\"Man need not see eye to eye, but he can walk arm-in-arm.\\" For fifteen years, he also served as an auxiliary chaplain at the Camden County Mental Hospital.Part of the County's Health and Human Services Department, Lakeland Campus, Blackwood, NJ. Lewis (seated, right) witnessing a ketubah, Jewish marriage document, 1974 During his tenure at Temple Beth Sholom, he served in a number of positions for major organizations of Conservative Judaism, including service on the Rabbinic Placement Commission of the Rabbinical Assembly, on the Education Commission of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism (USCJ), and five years as chairman of the National Youth Commission for the USCJ. In 1956, he led the first United Synagogue Youth (USY) pilgrimage to Europe and IsraelAlbert L. Lewis, So It Isn't Perfect, Huntington Printing Corporation, Camden, New Jersey:1967., p.v.‚Äîa group of eleven students that launched a program that now counts thousands of students among its past participants --The Israel Pilgrimage (IP) is conducted annually by USY in cooperation with the Jewish Agency, Youth and Hechalutz Department. continuing to lead pilgrimages for students and for adults to Israel, Europe, and Russia for many years thereafter.Albert L. Lewis, What's Your Glory?, 1984, book jacket. In 1967, shortly following the Six-Day War, he took a year- long sabbatical in Israel, visiting Egypt to retrace the route of the Biblical Exodus, writing a series of articles for Christian readers, in addition to the synagogue bulletins he wrote for his congregation, and teaching at Oranim Academic College.Cherry Hill Courier-Post, Barbara Rothschild, Feb 11, 2008. In 1963, Lewis accepted the invitation of JTS Chancellor Louis Finkelstein to serve in the newly created post of Rabbinic Tutor to participants in The Institute for Religious and Social Studies (IRSS). Established in 1938, the IRSS was an early, ground-breaking interfaith effort that brought together scholars and leaders in areas that spanned religion, economics, government, business, and science‚Äîacross faith lines‚Äîfor weekly sessions of discussion and study. Because of the importance of this program, Finkelstein had decided that rabbis who could best explain \\"the philosophy and beliefs\\" of Judaism should be hand-picked to participate. Lewis's responsibilities, as outlined in the letters he received from JTS and the RA, would include \\"making pertinent comments...asking helpful questions...[and]serving as a resource person,\\" both during the sessions and during the meals, where he would be seated \\"at a strategic place,\\" so that all could \\"take full advantage of...[his] presence.\\"Lewis, Op.cit., pp116-117. Throughout his career, he remained a strong supporter of JTS, voting against the admission of the first female applicant to the Rabbinical Assembly in 1984‚Äîdespite his strong support for the ordination and equal rights of women in Judaism‚Äîbecause he ultimately decided to side with the rabbis who felt that the first woman rabbi to be admitted to the RA should be one who was ordained by JTS.Area Woman Fails to Gain Rabbinical Assembly Place, Schenectady Gazette, May 17, 1984  Rabbinical Assembly  While serving as President of the Rabbinical Assembly from 1988 to 1990, Lewis oversaw a major expansion of RA efforts to train Conservative rabbis to support religious ritual needs, such as the preparation of gittin, religious divorce decrees.Washington Post, Marjorie Hyer, Conservative Rabbis Split, April 1, 1989. Additionally, classes were begun for religiously committed doctors within the movement, training them to perform Brit milah, ritual circumcision, and efforts were initiated to support synagogues considering the addition of a mikva, a ritual bath. These moves were seen as important steps to strengthen the Conservative movement on a national scale, diminishing the community's reliance on Orthodox rabbis, especially at a time, according to Lewis, when the gap between movements was growing, and Orthodox rabbis were becoming more reluctant to support the needs of non-Orthodox Jews.New York Times, Ari Goldman, Rabbinical Group to Widen its Role, April 1, 1989. Lewis referred to these initiatives as part of the \\"maturing\\" of the Conservative movement,Ibid. and said that, while there were some communities where Modern Orthodox rabbis still offered their \\"full cooperation\\" in matters of life-cycle rituals, the situation had been exacerbated by the Who is a Jew? controversy in Israel, where Orthodox rabbis were refusing to accept anyone converted under non-Orthodox auspices as Jewish.Developing New Ritual, David E. Anderson (UPI Religion Writer), Ellensburg Daily Record, Apr 1, 1989. Another major change in the RA Lewis oversaw as President was the inclusion of Hungarian and Czechoslovakian rabbis in the organization.Orlando Sentinel, July 29, 1989. Lewis hailed this expansion as a move \\"in the spirit of glasnost,\\" saying it presaged a new resurgency of Eastern European Jewry decimated at the hands of Nazism.Ibid. The inclusion of these Eastern European rabbis, which included an exchange of educational materials and teachers, would lead to a dramatic transformation of the group into a truly international organization, which today includes rabbis from Eastern and Western Europe, North and South America, Israel, Australia, and Asia.The Rabbinical Assembly Membership Directory, 5768/2008, an annual publication of the Rabbinical Assembly, New York. Additionally, on the national level, the RA became one of the few religious organizations of that time to take strong positions on government ethics, passing a resolution in 1989 to support a \\"significant pay increase\\" for members of the Senate and House of Representatives, contingent on the passage of a prohibition of speaking fees or other honoraria for congressional members.The Ellensburg Daily Record, Scandals Hurt, David E. Anderson, UPI Religion Writer, June 3, 1989.  Journalism and writing  Near Mount Sinai, Saint Catherine, Egypt, 1968Albom, op. cit., 42pp, includes a discussion of this photo. Lewis served as correspondent for The Catholic Star Herald, writing a series of articles for that paper during his sabbatical year in Israel. His articles, often accompanied by photographs he took during his travels, were introduced to readers on Oct 20, 1967, with Lewis's promise of \\"honest and objective reporting, and not propaganda,\\" stating that he would \\"try to present the feel or mood of Israel as accurately as possible.‚ÄùCatholic Star Herald, Rabbi Albert L. Lewis Dies, Wrote from Israel for Star-Herald, Feb 14, 2008. This obituary quoted from one of his contributions: In an article after the assassination of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, he wrote, ‚ÄúThe Yemenite woman ... when she heard the news, had her husband go to the synagogue to recite psalms for the soul of Kennedy. She knows little about politics. But she does understand, as the mother of seven, what the death of a husband and father means.‚Äù During his time in Egypt he traveled on press credentials for the Catholic paper, as Dr. Albert Lewis, in areas where it would likely have been problematic, and possibly even dangerous,Philadelphia Inquirer, Sally A. Downey, Rabbi Albert Lewis, 90, Feb 12, 2008. In this obituary, a Catholic Star Herald columnist is quoted as writing, \\"Where else but in America would you have a rabbi writing stories from a Moslem country for a Catholic newspaper, while risking his life?\\" to travel as an American Jew or rabbi, so soon after the end of the Six-Day War. Lewis wrote a comprehensive history and explanation of the Shofar, the ram's horn used as a part of traditional Jewish worship before and during the High Holy Days, for the Encyclopedia Judaica. This article, attributed to Lewis as the author, was listed as a reference in a corresponding article in the Encyclopaedia Islamica. Many of Lewis's sermons were quoted by Jewish and Christian colleagues in their talks and synagogue or church bulletins and newsletters, and a number of his articles were published or reprinted in Jewish newspapers and periodicals, including the Jewish Magazine.The Jewish Exponent, March 13, 2008. He was the author of two books, So It Isn't Perfect (1967), and What's Your Glory? (1984). The Hebrew prayerbook, Vaani T'Fillati, Siddur Yisraeli, published in Israel in 2009 for the Masorti (Conservative) movement, is dedicated in his memory.  The Singing Rabbi  With all of his outside achievements, it was his work with the men, women, and children of his synagogue that seemed to fuel his life, as recounted in Albom's book. Referred to as \\"the Reb,\\" a term of affection and endearment for rabbi, he in turn referred to his congregation as a Kehillah Kedoshah, a sacred community. His synagogue was well known as a model of what was called a \\"heimish\\" (homey) synagogue, welcoming in congregants as valued members of a close synagogue family.The Conservative Movement in Judaism: Dilemmas and Opportunities, Daniel Judah Elazar and Rela Mintz Geffen, Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, pg. 36. Early on during his career, he had been described as a \\"rare blend of modern prophet and humorist,\\" teaching through stories filled with humor and moral truth. Even when he was on vacation, including once when he used that vacation time to serve as a cruise chaplain on board the Holland America Line's SS Maasdam, he would write synagogue bulletin articles so that congregants could learn from his time away from them.Lewis, Op.Cit., p. 12. Lewis and his wife, Sarah, and their children,Albom, op. cit., 178pp. Albom's book includes a discussion of the death of Albert and Sarah Lewis's fourth child: Orah's twin sister, Rinah, who died when she was four years old. Lewis recounts his pain and his anger, and ultimately the role his faith played in helping him struggle with this tragic loss. Shalom, Orah, and Gilah, were constant role models for Jewishly- committed families, with Sarah's contributions to synagogue and larger Jewish community life notable in their own right.The Rabbi's Wife: The Rebbitzen in American Jewish Life, Shuly Rubin Schwartz, New York: New York University Press. Over the years, Lewis helped inspire eight members of the congregation, six men and two women, to become Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform rabbis. In addition, his son, Shalom, went on to serve as a rabbi of a Conservative synagogue.As of 2010, he serves at Congregation Etz Chaim in Marietta, George, where he has served since graduation from rabbinical school. Shortly after Lewis's death, an annual memorial lecture was established at Temple Beth Sholom in his memory, with Mitch Albom as the first guest lecturer, in 2009, returning for the 2010 lecture in dialogue with Rabbi David Wolpe, \\"to memorialize their teacher and friend.\\"Jewish Exponent, Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia, Vol 227, Issue 21, Feb 10, 2010. Albom describes Lewis as \\"the singing rabbi,\\" using song in a literal sense, in sermons and even in conversation, and in a larger sense, as part of a life \\"sung\\" with joy and imbued with faith. Albom quotes Lewis's stated \\"secret to happiness\\" as the ability to feel satisfaction and gratitude: to face life with thanksgiving. Observers reported that Lewis continued to offer pastoral care and comfort‚Äîand even a word of songAlbom, op. cit., p97: quoting a hospital nurse, \\"He sings all the time, this one.\\"‚Äîduring the last days of his life, in conversations with hospital workers who would come to him to hear his stories or ask for his blessing.Temple Beth Sholom Online. At his funeral, those in attendance were surprised to hear a final taped message from Lewis, teaching and comforting his congregants even after his death. The message touched on his beliefs in God's existence and human immortality, included an expression of gratitude for the \\"great experience\\" of having been with his friends, family, and congregants during his lifetime‚Äîand then the singing rabbi ended with words from a song: Shalom, Haverim: Farewell, friends.Jewish Community Voice, Jewish Federation of Southern New Jersey, Vol 67, No. 14, February 27, 2008.Temple Beth Sholom Temple Talk, Volume 28, No. 6, March 2008.  Have a Little Faith  Already famous for such works as Tuesdays with Morrie and The Five People You Meet in Heaven, author Mitch Albom (Mitchel David \\"Mitch\\" Albom) explains that this book began with the request by Lewis, his childhood rabbi, to write and deliver the eulogy when the time came for the rabbi's funeral. Albom agreed, contingent on an agreement that he could begin a series of interviews and conversations, in order to get to know Lewis as a man, not just as a rabbi. His conversations with Lewis eventually led to an increased interest in Albom's part in the power and meaning of faith in a larger sense. In his hometown of Detroit, Albom forged a link with Pastor Henry Covington, an African-American Protestant minister at the I Am My Brother's Keeper Church. Covington, a past drug-addict, dealer, and ex-convict, was ministering to the needs of his down-and-out parishioners, in an urban church serving a largely homeless congregation. The book draws upon Albom's awakened interest in faith, and in men like Lewis and Covington, who taught others its value, not only through their words, but also through their lives. Albom has told interviewers that he believes that the reason Lewis asked him to deliver the eulogy may actually have been a way to draw him back to the roots of his own faith, and \\"back to God a little bit.\\"Kirkus Reviews, Kirkus Supplements, Vol 5, No. 9, Oct 1, 2009).

The story takes place in Chromatacia, an alternate version of the United Kingdom wherein social class is determined by one's ability to perceive colour. Plot Chromatacia is a future dystopian society that exists at least five hundred years (although possibly more) after the collapse of our own society, identified as 'the Previous'. All life is governed by the laws set by Munsell, the supposed and revered founder of Chromatacia. The rules range from sensible, such as outlawing murder, to bizarre, such as outlawing the manufacture of spoons (though old spoons are often kept as personal heirlooms). The social hierarchy of Chromatacia is defined by the ability to see colour, which is limited in most people to varying degrees of one hue, or at most two. Those who can see red predominantly are in the second-lowest social order (only ranking above 'Greys', who cannot perceive colour), and 'Ultra Violets' hold the highest rank. The perception of colour also affects their health and wellness: certain colours have medical effects on people. Doctors in this world are called \\"swatchmen\\", since they show swatches of colour to their patients. Shades of green, especially Lincoln green, act as a narcotic, and are often abused as recreational drugs. Surnames and names of towns are usually derived from various shades of colour, such as jade, carmine and saffron. Protagonist Eddie Russett is a 'Red' sent to the outer-fringe town of East Carmine to conduct a chair census, which he speculates is punishment for a practical joke played on the son of a prefect. There he meets Jane, a Grey with an upturned nose and a fierce temper, who often causes personal injury to whomever she meets. Eddie's father becomes the swatchman of the village and is well liked by the Greys. In the course of the story, Eddie discovers that much of what the government has told the public is not true. Specifically he learns that misfits, supposedly sent to Emerald City to be brainwashed, are taken to the deserted town of High Saffron where they are killed by looking at a building whose colour is poisonous. Details reveal that East Carmine is located in Wales (the A470 road is mentioned), and the description of the town close to the lower of a series of five dams suggests it is Rhayader, at the foot of the Elan Valley. Nearby Rusty Hill was once Builth Wells. The town of Vermillion used to be Hereford. The town of High Saffron is on the coast beyond the dams, which suggests Aberystwyth. The colour values as described in the book supposedly come from the Munsell color system as described by Albert Henry Munsell, but are derived from the HSV color model. The \\"Ishihara\\", a test used to determine one's colour vision, is a reference to Shinobu Ishihara, the inventor of the Ishihara colour perception test. Characters * Eddie Russett: Protagonist, a Red with good perception. He has unquestioningly toed the line for twenty years but learning the truth behind the Collective disrupts his life. * Jane G23: A rather violent and short-tempered Grey who has some rare abilities. * Violet deMauve: A spoilt brat on the Blue side of Purple (her mother was Navy) who always gets her way and is determined to marry Eddie to bring her family line back to full Purple. * Tommo Cinnabar: A Red with a huge array of scams, deals and negotiations going on. He would sell his own grandmother if the price was right, and did on one occasion. * Dorian: A Grey, the editor of the local newspaper and a very talented photographer. Wishes to elope with Imogen. * Courtland Gamboge: The Yellow Deputy Prefect who abuses his power and is interested only in making himself look good. He and Eddie do not see eye to eye on anything. * Sally Gamboge: East Carmine's Yellow Prefect, a nasty piece of work who looks out for her own family. * Holden Russett: A Red, Eddie's father and the village Swatchman. * Travis Canary: A fallen Yellow who is escaping from Reboot. He runs out of the village into the night one evening. * Bunty McMustard: An officious Yellow. * Imogen Fandango: A low-level Purple who is in love with Dorian. They want to elope. * Carlos Fandango: The lowest- level Purple in East Carmine, and the Janitor, responsible for maintaining the two cars and the street lights. * Lucy Ochre: A young Red girl with an obsession with hidden harmonies in the Earth. * George deMauve: Purple Prefect, and Head Prefect of East Carmine. He is interested only in getting his daughter married to a strong Red and the family getting back up to hue. * Mr Turquoise: East Carmine's Blue Prefect * Mr Yewberry: East Carmine's Red Prefect * Constance Oxblood: Eddie's sweetheart, although the feeling is mostly on Eddie's side. She is a wealthy Red and has to choose between marrying Eddie or Roger Maroon. * Mrs Lapis-Lazuli: A Blue ninth-generation librarian in East Carmine * Matthew Gloss: An employee from National Colour who is in East Carmine to conduct the Ishihara tests and supposedly fix a leaking magenta pipe. It is implied that he is a Red. He encourages Eddie to join National Colour, but appears to have a darker side. * Velma Ochre: A slightly eccentric Red who wishes to marry Holden Russett. * Bertie Magenta: A posh Purple from Jade-under-Lime, on whom Eddie plays a prank that results in him getting sent to East Carmine. * Zane: A grey who disguised as a purple in Vermillion, we later find out he's in a bigger picture. Inspiration The beginning of the book contains a quote from philosopher Alfred North Whitehead on the subject of colour: Series In a 2009 interview, the author mentioned two further books in the series. The titles Painting by Numbers and The Gordini Protocols have been suggested; however, neither is scheduled for publication as of December 2019.

Two passengers were killed and 25 injured, as well as the train attendant. Description The situation The exit from Kings Cross station is through Gasworks Tunnel, which has three bores, each of which had two tracks at the time of the accident. The centre bore had the No. 1 down main line on its western side, and the up relief line on its eastern side. Trains from platforms 5, 6 or 7the present-day platforms 4, 5 & 6 gained the no. 1 down main line via a crossover from the up relief line, which was controlled by points no. 145. One end of this crossover was inside the tunnel. When points 145 were \\"reversed\\", the no. 1 down main line could be reached from platforms 5, 6 or 7; when points 145 were \\"normal\\", this line was reached from platforms 8 to 17. The signal box controlling this was situated at the end of platforms 5 & 6\\\\. The track is level through platform 5; it then dips at 1 in 100 (1%) for , to a point inside the tunnel, where the line passes beneath Regent's Canal; it then rises at a gradient of 1 in 105 (0.95%) through the tunnel for a total of . Because of the gradient in the tunnel, it had been the practice since December 1943 for heavy trains to be assisted for the first by being propelled by the locomotive which had hauled the empty coaches into the platform. During the night and morning of 3‚Äì4 February 1945, the worn rails of no. 1 down main line had been replaced with new ones as part of routine maintenance; this line had been in use since 12:45 on 4 February. The newly laid rails had lower adhesion, and the first (empty) train to travel on them slipped to a stand on the incline. The train On 4 February 1945, the 18:00 service from Kings Cross to Leeds was formed of 17 coaches hauled by locomotive no. 2512 Silver Fox. The locomotive, Class A4 4-6-2 no. 2512 Silver Fox, had been built in 1935. It was in normal condition but some trouble had been experienced that day with the sanding gear. The rearmost coach was a Vestibuled Brake Composite, no. 1889, which had been built at Doncaster in 1941 as part of an order for ten (authorised in 1939 against order no. 999). The design, known as Diagram 314, used a steel underframe long, mounted on two bogies each having a wheelbase of , spaced at centres. The body was long, wide, and built largely of wood, principally teak. It consisted of two first- class compartments in the centre seating six each, flanked on one side by three third-class compartments also seating six each, and on the other side by a brake section for the guard. There was a side corridor, and unlike other pre-war designs of brake composite on the LNER, the external doors in the body sides were in vestibules close to the ends, instead of in the compartments; a feature which had been gradually introduced from 1930. Events On this occasion the train was not assisted, because the coaches had been propelled, rather than hauled, into the platform, and so there was no locomotive at the rear as was the usual arrangement. The train left platform 5 at King's Cross station five minutes late, and entered Gasworks Tunnel. When it reached the rising gradient at the far end of the tunnel the locomotive began to slip badly on a section of newly replaced rail. In the absence of an assisting locomotive and with its own sanding equipment not working fully, no. 2512 was unable to grip the rail and eventually came to a stand. Preoccupied with his tasks at the controls and operating in darkness the driver didn't notice when the train slowed to a stop, and then began to run backwards. Meanwhile, the points behind the train (no. 145) had been set for the next departure, which was to be from Platform 10. The coaches for this service, the 19:00 Aberdonian to , were already in the platform. The signalman became aware of the 18:00 train rolling back and operated the points again in order to route it into unoccupied platform 15, but he was too late; the first bogie of the rear coach (BCK no. 1889) had already passed. This caused the two bogies to take different tracks. The rear of the train collided with the front of the coaches in platform 10. The rear coach rose into the air and struck a signal gantry, crushing one of the two first-class compartments in the middle of the coach. Two passengers were killed, one of whom was Cecil Kimber, the former managing director and co-founder of the MG car company. After the accident The signal gantry demolished in the collision carried shunting discs and platform indicators in addition to main aspect signals. In an emergency measure hand signallers were introduced to control main line trains using platforms 6 to 17, as well as movements to and from the locomotive yard. Suburban services were terminated and turned round at . Coach no. 1889 was so severely damaged that it was written off. It had been scheduled to be renumbered 10153, but that number then remained unused. Two weeks later, the signal gantry was replaced, but complete services were not restored until 23 February 1945. The accident has variously been described as \\"somewhat bizarre\\" and \\"stupid\\". The Inspecting Officer, Col. Wilson, concluded in his report that the main fault lay with the driver. Although it was difficult for him to tell which direction he was moving in the tunnel, he should have anticipated the possibility that he might roll back after the prolonged slipping. He did not realise for some minutes after the train had stopped that a collision had occurred. A similar accident occurred at Glasgow Queen Street in 1928, involving a lighter train but on a much steeper gradient.

It offers all six shipping modes (i.e. Lift-on Lift-off, Roll-on Roll-off, Liquid Bulk, Dry Bulk, Break Bulk and Cruise). In 2015, over 11 million tonnes of freight were shipped through the Port of Cork, making it Ireland‚Äôs second busiest port. As well as its berths upriver at Cork City, the port also includes other major locations across Cork Harbour, including Tivoli loading docks in the eastern suburbs, Cobh on the south of Great Island and Ringaskiddy on the west side of the harbour. History Historically, the navigation and port facilities of the city and harbour were managed by the Cork Harbour Commissioners. Founded in 1814, the Cork Harbour Commissioners moved to the Custom House in 1904. Following the implementation of the 1996 Harbours Act, by March 1997 all assets of the Commissioners were transferred to the Port of Cork Company. This statutory body is responsible for the management, control, operation and development of the Port of Cork and the harbour. Operations The Port of Cork company is a commercial semi-state company with responsibility for the commercial running of the harbour, as well as for navigation and berthage in the port. In 2011, the company had a turnover of ‚Ç¨21.4 million and made pre- tax profits of ‚Ç¨1.2 million. This was down from a turnover of ‚Ç¨26.4 million and profits of ‚Ç¨5.4 million in 2006. Container traffic increased by 6% in 2011 when 156,667 teus were handled at the Tivoli container facility, however this was down from a peak of 185,000 teus in 2006. The 2006 figure saw the port at full capacity and the company drew up plans for a new container facility capable of handling up to 400,000 teus per annum at Ringaskiddy, which was the subject of major objections. Following a public Oral Planning Hearing in 2008, the Irish planning board An Bord Plean√°la rejected the plan due to inadequate rail and road links at the location. There has been an increase in cruise ship visits to Cork Harbour in the early 21st century, with 53 such ships visiting the port in 2011, increasing to approximately 100 cruise ship visits by 2019. These cruise ships berth at the Port of Cork's deep-water quay in Cobh, which is Ireland's only dedicated berth for cruise ships. Traffic Vessels up to are capable of coming through entrance to Cork Harbour. As the shipping channels get shallower the farther inland one travels, access becomes constricted, and only vessels up to can sail above Cobh. The Port of Cork provides pilotage and towage facilities for vessels entering Cork Harbour. All vessels accessing the quays in Cork City must be piloted and all vessels exceeding 130 metres in length must be piloted once they pass within of the harbour entrance. Facilities Cork Harbour map showing Port of Cork locations at Cork, Tivoli, Ringaskiddy and Cobh The Port of Cork has berthing facilities at Cork City, Tivoli, Ringaskiddy, and Cobh. Cork City's quays are primarily used for grain and oil transport. The city quays house 10 berths, mostly privately owned. Tivoli's facilities provide container handling, facilities for oil and ore, livestock, and a roll on-roll off (Ro-Ro) ramp. Prior to the opening of Ringaskiddy Ferry Port, some car ferries also sailed from here. Now, the Ro-Ro ramp at Tivoli is used by companies importing cars into Ireland. Ringaskiddy is home to a passenger and car ferry terminal, and operates as a deep water port. Cobh's quays are used as a terminal for cruise ships - the only such dedicated cruise terminal in the Republic of Ireland. There are a number of other private berths elsewhere around the harbour. These are usually associated with a particular industry. These specialised berths are in Whitegate (oil jetties), Passage West (grain), Rushbrooke (cargo), Ringaskiddy (car ferry) and Haulbowline (naval/military). Passenger ferries Car ferry at Ringaskiddy Operating since the late 1970s, Brittany Ferries runs a ferry service to Roscoff in France. This operates between April and November from the Ro Ro facilities at Ringaskiddy. Previous ferry services ran to Swansea in Wales and Santander in Spain. The former, the Swansea Cork ferry, ran initially between 1987 and 2006 and also briefly between 2010 and 2012. The latter, a Brittany Ferries Cork‚ÄìSantander service, started in 2018 but was cancelled in early 2020.

Built in the 1780s using a design by architect Giovanni Francesco Lucchini, the theatre was originally referred to as either the Teatro Nuovo or Teatro di Fiera. The first opera to be mounted at the theatre, Giuseppe Sarti's Medonte, re di Epiro, was in 1784 while the opera house was still under construction. The official opening of the house, under the name the Teatro Riccardi, did not occur until 24 August 1791 with a production of Pietro Metastasio's Didone abbandonata set to music by multiple composers, including Ferdinando Bertoni, Giacomo Rampini, Johann Gottlieb Naumann, Giuseppe Gazzaniga, and Giovanni Paisiello. In 1797 the original theatre was destroyed by a fire, possibly by arson. Lucchini was contracted again to design a new structure to replace the old one and the new house opened on 30 June 1800. The structure uses a horseshoe shape with three tiers of boxes and two galleries. In 1897 the name of the theatre was changed to the Teatro Gaetano Donizetti (now shortened to Teatro Donizetti) on the occasion of the centenary of the composer's birth. Donizetti was born in Bergamo's Borgo Canale quarter and his first opera, Il Pigmalione (composed 1816), was given its world premiere at the theatre on 13 October 1960.

KG 1 was created in 1939 as the Luftwaffe reorganised and expanded to meet Adolf Hitler's rearmament demands. It was founded in May 1939 and by December 1939, had three active Gruppen (Groups). In August 1940 a fourth Gruppe was added. 1 operated the Heinkel He 111 medium bomber and later the Heinkel He 177 heavy bomber. KG 1 served in the Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 which began the war in Europe. It spent the Phoney War on reconnaissance operations and dropping propaganda leaflets over France. In May and June 1940 it fought in the Battle of Belgium and Battle of France. In July 1940, the force took part in the Battle of Britain and The Blitz. In June 1941 it supported Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. Elements of the bomber wing remained on the Eastern Front for the duration of the conflict. 1 also served intermittently in the Italian Campaign from March‚ÄìAugust 1943. All KG 1 Gruppen ceased to exist by September 1944 and were merged with other Luftwaffe units before the German capitulation in May 1945. History Kampgeschwader 1 (KG 1) was formed from Stab/KG 152 'Hindenburg' at Neubrandenburg on 1 May 1939.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 13. Generalmajor Ulrich Kessler was its first commander (Geschwaderkommodore). The Geschwader (Wing) was named after the deceased General Paul von Hindenburg. The unit was assigned the Hindenburg family crest as its emblem.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 15. I./KG 1 was formed from IV./KG 152 at Kolberg. The Gruppe (group) was assigned the Heinkel He 111 medium bomber. The first batch of aircraft were E variants, with traditional stepped-cockpit, in contrast to the widely recognised Stepless cockpit of the later He 111P and -H models. The Gruppe was placed under the command of Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) Oberstleutnant Robert Krauss.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 14. II Gruppe were formed from the disbanded I./KG 152 at Breslau-Sch√∂ngarten (today Copernicus Airport Wroc≈Çaw), Silesia. It is possible this Gruppe was to be used as I.(K)./LG 3 (Lehrgeschwader‚ÄîLearning Wing). It was formed on 18 September 1939, with the war in Europe already underway.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 17. Oberstleutnant Benno Kosch was its first commanding officer. Elements of I. and II. Gruppen provided the personnel for founding III./KG 1 on 1 December 1939. Major Otto Schnelle was given command. The Stab. and I Gruppen were placed into training which lasted throughout the summer, 1939. 1, with only one full Gruppe active in September 1939, remained at Kolberg.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 19. Operational history Stab./KG 1 was assigned to Luftflotte 4, commanded by Alexander L√∂hr under the 2nd Fliegerdivision at Kolberg. I Gruppe, still with the He 111E was also at Kolberg, was subordinated to L√∂hr also. On 14 September 1939, both were transferred to 1st Fliegerdivision, under the command of Luftflotte 1 headed by Albert Kesselring. The two commands combined fielded 47 He 111s, with 41 combat ready. L√∂hr began the invasion with 729 aircraft.Hooton 1994, p. 177. All nine of Stab./KG 1's were operational. The command unit was equipped with the H variant. Invasion of Poland and Phoney war KG 1 was based on the Baltic Sea coast. Its mission was to support the 4th Army's invasion of the \\"Polish corridor\\", capture of Gdynia, and assist the 3rd Army, advancing from East Prussia, in destroying the Pomorze Army.Hooton 1994, p. 175. On the opening day, 1 September 1939, the Wehrmacht invaded. The Luftwaffe planned an enormous air attack on Warsaw, codenamed Operation Wasserkante, while also destroying the Polish Air Force on the ground.Hooton 1994, p. 176. The plan was revised after complaints from the General Staff of the Wehrmacht (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht). Luftflotte 4 was impeded by severe mist which covered its airfields on that morning. Nevertheless, I./KG 1 were one of only four Gruppen to take off on time.Hooton 1994, p. 179. The group struck at airfields in Puck, Rumia and Toru≈Ñ. It also bombed Polish Army forces at Ko≈õcierzyna and Starogard Gda≈Ñski. Polish forces at Bydgoszcz and Danzig, were also bombed on 3 September. The Bydgoszcz G≈Ç√≥wna railway station was probably the target. On 3 September KG 1 attacked the Polish Navy, in support of the Kriegsmarine. With II. and II./StG 2, IV(St)./LG 1, 3./K√ºFlGr 706 and 4.(St)/TrGr 186, it bombed the Naval Aviation Dyon, the torpedo boat Mazur, tender Nurek, damaging the Wicher and the minelayer Gryf, which were later finished off by 4.(St)/TrGr 186.Hooton 1994, p. 182. Polish targets in the Toru≈Ñ and Bydgoszcz regions were attacked again on 4 September and the Gruppe moved to Ziethen, Brandenburg later in the day. From its new operating base it flew rail interdiction operations northeast of Warsaw on 5 September and Kutno the following day. Road and rail interdiction missions were flown against Polish traffic along the Rava-Ruska lines on 8 September. It moved back to Schongarten on 8 September and flew against targets east of the Vistula from 8‚Äì12 September. Along with II./KG 26, I./KG 53 and I./KG 2 it bombed I≈Ç≈ºa, to break up the concentred forces of the Prusy Army, and operated in the Battle of Radom. Against, L√∂hr's objections, incendiary bombs rather than high explosive bombs were used.Hooton 1994, p. 185. A He 111P over Poland, September 1939 KG 1 also bombed Polish troop concentrations in the Battle of Bzura. PiƒÖtek was targeted by KG 1 on 13 September. On 14 September KG 1 was placed under the command of Bruno Loerzer and 1st Fliegerdivision, under the command of Luftflotte 1, to support the 14th Army's attacks in southern Poland, alongside KG 26 and KG 55.Hooton 1994, p. 186. KG 1 bombed rail lines near Kowel on 15 September, and then it moved to Krosno. Its last recorded operations were flown against rail traffic between Kowel and Luzk on 16 September 1939. The group was taken out of operations no later 21 September. I./KG 1 spent the Phoney War in training. It moved to Fa√überg Air Base on 16 October 1939 and to Giessen on 10 November. At Giessen it trained in mine- laying until 2 Staffel (squadron) left to become the nucleus of KGr 126 on 21 February 1940. The unit was renamed III./KG 26. At that time, I./KG 1 replaced 1./KG 4, which began to train on air supply missions. I./KG 1 began its training on 10 February.Hooton 1994, p. 217. The reorientation to mine-laying occurred because Hitler refused Hermann G√∂ring's request to attack ports in the British Isles until he had ordered Fall Gelb. Instead, Hitler issued Directive 9, which called for attacks on British sea communications. The Luftwaffe was to focus on mining operations until the land offensive began.Hooton 1994, p. 216. 2 staffel was later refounded at Nordhausen. From 25 March 1940 I Gruppe began dropping propaganda leaflets over eastern France. II Gruppe moved to Neubrandenburg on 21 September and on to Delmenhorst on 1 October. Until April 1940 it remained in training. From 16 October 1939 it was based at L√ºneburg. From at least 20 April 1940, it began reconnaissance and leaflet dropping over France. After briefly transferring to Erfurt, it moved to Kirtorf/Hesse on 9 May 1940.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 16. III./KG 1 spent the winter, 1939‚Äì40 working up and training. It moved to Nordhausen and became fully operational on 2 February 1940. From 20 April 1940, it also flew night sorties, reconnaissance and leaflet dropping missions over eastern France. The Stab./KG 1 flew operations on 1 September 1939 against targets along the Vistula River. Thereafter it was moved to Ziethen from Kolberg on 4 September. It was placed under the command of Luftflotte 4 at Breslau on 8 September. It may have taken part in the Battle of Bzura on 10 September but was moved to the 2nd Fliegerdivision on 14 September. After relocating to Neubrandenburg it was placed under 1st Fliegerdivision, belonging to Luftflotte 1 on 20 September. It was based at Delmenhorst from 1 October, L√ºneburg from 16 October, and then Giessen on 10 November 1939 under the IV. Fliegerkorps. Over the winter the Stab./KG 54 was moved to I. Fliegerkorps (Luftflotte 3) with five bombers, three operational, on 10 May 1940. Western Europe KG 1 was assigned to Fliegerkorps IV on 10 November 1939. The date at which it was transferred to Fliegerkorps I, subordinated to Luftflotte 1 by 10 May 1940. The Fliegerkorps was placed under the overall command of Luftflotte 3, commanded by Hugo Sperrle, just prior to the offensive.Cull, Lander, Weiss 1999, p. 12. Based at Giessen Stab./KG 1 had three of five He 111H bombers operational. Ulrich Kessler had relinquished command on 17 December 1939 to Oberst Ernst Exss, who assumed leadership of KG 1 on 18 December. The command of I./KG 1 was taken over by Major Ludwig Maier in November 1939. All other Gruppen retained their commanding officers. I Gruppe could muster 25 operational Heinkels from 35. II./KG 1, at Kirtorf, had 35 at its disposal with 23 operational. III Gruppe at Ettinghausen on 9 May, contributed 27 serviceable bombers from 33. All three Gruppen possessed the H variant. On the morning of 10 May 1940, Fall Gelb began. I./KG 1 took off and attacked the La F√®re and Amiens ‚Äì Glisy Aerodrome. It also bombed rail stations at Beaumont-Hamel, France and Philippeville, Belgium. II./KG 1 bombed four airfields: Cambrai-Niergnies Airport, Li√®ge Airport, Albert ‚Äì Picardie Airport and Valenciennes-Denain Airport. III./KG 1 bombed the same targets and an aircraft factory near Albert. No 60 Wing RAF engaged III./KG 1 with No. 85 Squadron RAF, and claimed three bombers shot down.Cull, Lander, Weiss 1999, p. 28. 6 and 7 Staffeln lost a bomber each to No. 607 Squadron RAF, of the 61st Wing RAF with both crews.Cull, Lander, Weiss 1999, pp. 35, 37. III./KG 1's attack on the Potez factory near Albert was met by Hawker Hurricanes and 607 claimed another three of the German bombers.Cull, Lander, Weiss 1999, p. 39. German records shot show III Gruppe suffered the loss of five on 10 May with another two seriously damaged. Two complete crews were killed and one captured. The biggest casualty was Major Schnelle. The Gruppenkommandeur was shot down and killed two miles east of Saint-Quentin, Aisne.Cull, Lander, Weiss 1999, pp. 41‚Äì42. In later operation, I./KG 1 flew more missions in the Ghent-Brussels-Antwerp area and it lost another bomber.Cull, Lander, Weiss 1999, pp. 49‚Äì50. The purpose was to support the 4th Army in southern Belgium. It continued to do so from 11‚Äì16 May. KG 1 bombers, 21 June 1940 II Gruppe supported the 4th Army's advance over the same period. It was ordered to support the drive into the Loire Valley by attacking tank concentrations and rail targets along the line of the advance. The Gruppen switched to Cologne Butzweilerhof on 20 May. 1's activities in the intervening period are uncertain, but II./KG 1 operated over Cambrai on 17 and 18 May. I. and II Gruppen began night attacks on Boulogne in the battle for the port.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, pp. 14, 17, 19. All three Gruppen undertook bombing and armed reconnaissance operations as the Battle of Calais and Battle of Dunkirk. 1 began maritime interdiction operations to prevent the Dunkirk evacuation from 21‚Äì31 May 1940. On 27 May, the first full day of the evacuation, KG 1 bombed the east mole, with KG 54, though the latter probably sank the 8,000-ton French Navy steamer Aden.Jackson 1974, p. 116.Franks 2006, p. 43. On 3 June 1940 II./KG 1 took part in Operation Paula as did III./KG 1. Six other bomber wings took part in the attack; KG 2, KG 3, KG 4, KG 30, KG 54 and LG 1. JG 2, JG 53, JG 54, JG 77 and ZG 26, provided fighter escort.Jackson 1974, pp. 81‚Äì83. The German bomber stream was sighted over Reims-Coulommiers, and Cambrai. A French Potez 630 from GC I/3 shadowed the formation. It reported the height and direction of the bombers via radio to the Eiffel Tower. The message was garbled and many French fighter units failed to understand it and scrambled too late. Large air battles developed but losses of KG 1 are unknown. 15 factories were hit, but only three suffered significant damage. 254 civilians and 652 were injured. The airfields hit were damaged. On the 13 airfields, only 16 aircraft were destroyed and six damaged. Six runways had been put out of action, and 21 motor vehicles destroyed. Twenty-one military personnel were killed. The commander of KG 51, Josef Kammhuber, was shot down and captured during Paula. He would later command KG 1, albeit for only five days. German bomber losses amounted to just four. Six German fighters were lost. 35 French aircraft were lost in total.Hooton 2007b, p. 84. On 4 June I and II Gruppe moved to Amiens ‚Äì Glisy Aerodrome, KG 1's target on the opening day of the offensive. III./KG 1 moved to Lille‚ÄìVendeville. II. and III. Gruppen supported the 4th Army's drive into the Loire Valley and the advance to Le Havre from 5‚Äì11 June in support of Fall Rot, the second phase of the offensive. I Gruppe attacked targets in Orl√©ans on 14 June and attacked shipping in Brest and Cherbourg harbours from 15‚Äì19 June 1940. On the night of the 18/19 June 1940, III./KG 1 and II. and III./LG 1 bombed the port of Bordeaux and flew 30 sorties the following day involving flights of up to 480 kilometres.Hooton 2007b, p. 88. II. and III./KG 1 supported the effort against the ports. III Gruppe moved to Rosieres-en-Santerre Airfield, after operating from forward strips near Boulogne from 20 June. It transferred six days after the French surrender on 1 July 1940. Battle of Britain After the Armistice of 22 June 1940, the Luftwaffe settled into airfields along the French, Belgian and Dutch coasts. The British refusal to surrender or come to terms with Germany, precipitated Adolf Hitler's order for Operation Sealion, an amphibious invasion of Britain which was to take place after Luftwaffe had secured air superiority over the English Channel. The German Air Staff, Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL), was ordered by Hermann G√∂ring, to begin attacks on targets in southern England after the publication of his 30 June directive.Hooton 1997, p. 17. Stab./KG 1 and all three Gruppen remained under the command of Fliegerkorps I. The command unit was based at Amiens ‚Äì Glisy on 11 June, and remained there until 13 August. I Gruppe was based at Montdidier and Clairmont in late June. It began night sorties over the United Kingdom from 22 June 1940 to test RAF Fighter Command night fighter defences. It flew an operation over London on 4 July. II./KG 1 also engaged in probing attacks on shipping in the English Channel. It carried out bombing operations on some industrial targets and airfields, in what the Germans referred to as the Kanalkampf phase of the Battle of Britain. III. Gruppe was reorganised into an operational training unit, similar to RAF organisations. It had little direct part in the air war over Britain, although it was sent on a small number of air raids against RAF airfields and industrial targets at night from 17‚Äì25 August. On 15 July it possessed 32 Heinkels, with 15 operational. Stab./KG 1 had all four bombers operational. I. and II Gruppen had 23 operational from 27 and 29 from 31 respectively. A 7th Staffel KG 1 Heinkel He 111 on a mission during the Battle of Britain, 1940 The probing attacks cost KG 1 its first casualties on 5 July. One II. Gruppe bomber force-landed at Amiens to engine failure and at 6:30, 8 staffel lost a He 111 shot down and the crew killed in action, when it was intercepted by a Supermarine Spitfires from No. 65 Squadron RAF. The crew were the first KG 1 fatalities of the campaign.Mason 1969, p. 142. The Battle of Britain opened on 10 July. On this first day, the Royal Air Force (RAF) sent Bomber Command to attack Luftwaffe airfields in France. II./KG 1's base at Amiens was attacked by No. 607 Squadron RAF. The six Bristol Blenheim's began there attack in cloudy weather but it was not sufficient to protect them. Anti-aircraft artillery shot five of the six down before German fighters could intervene.Bungay 2000, p. 151. The following day 1 Staffel lost two bombers destroyed and another severely damaged when KG 1 attempted to bomb the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The bomber formation was intercepted by Hurricanes from No. 145 Squadron RAF and Spitfires from No. 601 Squadron RAF. The former accounted for both destroyed aircraft.Mason 1969, pp. 161‚Äì163. On 12 July 1940, 1 lost its Geschwaderkommodore Ernst Exss, who was shot down and posted missing in action. Josef Jammhuber, the future commanding officer of the German night of fighter force, took his place until 17 July.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 18. On 3 August KG 1 sent a small number of Heinkels over Kent. The intruders avoided interception and one bomb struck a Royal Observer Corps post at Higham. The following day 7, 8 and 9 Staffeln suffered one damaged bomber each to unknown causes.Mason 1969, pp. 209‚Äì210. The battle moved inland on 13 August with Adlertag. On 16 August II./KG 1 attacked RAF Duxford. KG 1 bombed RAF Biggin Hill on 18 August‚Äîknown as The Hardest Day because of high losses. 1 dispatched 60 He 111s from Amiens to conduct a high-level attack on Biggin Hill. KG 76, based in airfields to the north of Paris, was to attack RAF Kenley. 76 fielded 48 Dornier Do 17s and Junkers Ju 88s for a low-level attack. Fighter escort was provided by JG 3, JG 26, JG 51, JG 52, JG 54 and ZG 26. The Jagdgeschwader were ordered to carry out free-hunting and close escort from bases in the Pas-de-Calais.Price 2010, p. 61. The mission went awry, and KG 76 suffered heavy losses. 1 lost two bombers; one each from 1 and 2 Staffeln in combat with 65 Squadron.Mason 1969, pp. 282‚Äì283. JG 54 prevented No. 610 Squadron RAF from inflicting more losses while KG 1 was on its bomb-run, but 65 Squadron was able to intercept with the German fighter unit was locked in combat.Bungay 2000, p. 228.Price 2010, pp. 104‚Äì105. II Gruppe flew night operations against industrial areas from 17‚Äì25 August. III Gruppe were among the few German units to fly on 27 August 1940 because of deteriorating weather conditions. Near Portland in the early morning, Flying Officer Peter O'Brian and Pilot Officer William Beaumont from No. 152 Squadron RAF, engaged and shot down a III./KG 1 bomber flown by Gruppenkommandeur Major Willibald Fanelsa, who was killed with his crew.Mason 1969, pp. 311‚Äì312. Fanelsa had been appointed to replace Hans Steinweg only days earlier. Hauptmann Otto Stams took command on 1 September 1940.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 21. The following day, KG 1 was involved in the morning air battles and lost one bomber fifty percent damaged after action with No. 79 Squadron RAF. 4 Staffel lost one bomber and two crew members killed and two wounded when an external bomb fell off during take-off and detonated.Mason 1969, pp. 313‚Äì315. KG 1 Heinkels at low-level. The photograph is taken from the bomb-aimer's position in the tip of the nose. On 30 August 30 He 111s from II./KG 1 targeted the Royal Aircraft Establishment.Mason 1969, p. 323. Escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 110s, the Gruppe flew up the Thames Estuary but was intercepted by 26 Hurricanes of 1, 242 and 501 Squadrons. The bomber force penetrated as far at Luton, where 10 bombs were dropped on the Vauxhall Motors plant. The projectiles killed 53 people and caused 113 casualties in total.Mason 1969, p. 324. In the retreat to France KG 1 lost five He 111s. 5 Staffel bore the brunt of the losses with four and 6 Staffel lost one bomber. The battle was joined by 56 and 253 Squadrons, which were credited with one bomber each. 1 Squadron was also credited with a bomber destroyed while 242 Squadron destroyed two of the 5 Staffel bombers. 1 Squadron's victim was Staffelkapit√§n Hauptmann Baess, commanding 5 Staffel, who was killed in Werknummer 2720, V4+BV.Mason 1969, pp. 324‚Äì325. On 1 and 4 September 1940 I./KG 1 bombed Tilbury docks. One 6 Staffel bomber was sixty percent damaged by RAF fighters on the first operation.Mason 1969, p. 338. Major Ludwig Maier, Gruppenkommandeur of I Gruppe was killed on the night of the 4/5 September. Herrick and Pugh, crewing a Blenheim night fighter, shot down Maier and his crew at 02:15. Werknummer 3324, V4+AB, crashed and all the crew were killed.Mason 1969, p. 349. Hauptmann Hermann Crone replaced him. On 7 September 1940, the Luftwaffe shifted its attention to Greater London. On this morning the London Blitz began with an assault upon the city by five Kampfgeschwader‚Äî1, 2, 3, 26 and 76. Bf 110s from ZG 2, and Bf 109s from JG 2, 3, 51, 52, 54, I./JG 77 and I. and II./LG 2 were sent to escort them.Mason 1969, p. 359. KG 53 was added as another eight Gruppen of 318 He 111s and Do 17s struck the capital. 306 people died and 1,337 were injured in the capital and another 142 killed in the suburbs.Mason 1969, pp. 363‚Äì364. Two bombers from 3 and 4 Staffeln were lost, and Geschwaderkommodore Koch was wounded by RAF fighters.Mason 1969, p. 367. By 7 September, I Gruppe reported 22 from 36 He 111s operational. On 9 September KG 1 mounted the single largest raid on this date. It appears the target was Farnborough again. II./KG 1 committed 26 bombers to the attack supported by 20 Bf 110s from ZG 76 and 60 Bf 109s from JG 3. The German intruders headed on a westerly course, to avoid the main concentration of RAF bases at Biggin Hill, RAF Kenley, RAF Croydon and RAF Northolt. The approach failed and nine RAF squadrons engaged the German flights. The British made a head-on-attack with around 70 fighters. The Bf 110s adopted a Lufbery circle and one staffel of bombers jettisoned their bombs over Purley and Epsom, and turned back. The fleeing bombers joined up with 40 Junkers Ju 88s from KG 30, which was under attack from 253 and No. 303 Squadron RAF. 30 lost five bombers. 1 suffered only three He 111s damaged‚Äîtwo with around sixty percent damage and one with thirty-five. III./ZG 76 lost three fighters and one damaged and JG 3 lost another three protecting KG 1.Mason 1969, pp. 373‚Äì376. KG 1 suffered heavier losses on 11 September. In an attack on London, 6./KG 1 suffered one bomber damaged as did 3 staffel, which also lost one crew killed. Another crew were lost, and a third from the Stab./KG 1‚Äîfor a total of three bombers destroyed and two damaged.Mason 1969, p. 381. On 15 September the Luftwaffe carried out large-scale attacks on London. 1 was involved and only 1 Staffel reported the loss of an aircraft.Price 1990, p. 111.Mason 1969, p. 392. KG 1 are recorded in action on 29 September and 3 and 5 Staffeln lost one bomber and one damaged each. One more bomber was lost and two damaged in landing accidents on 3 October.Mason 1969, pp. 422, 430. On a raid to London on night of the 4/5 October another II Gruppe bomber was lost and a second damaged. Three Junkers Ju 88s, now beginning to arrive in KG 1 were destroyed in accidents in the following days.Mason 1969, pp. 433, 436, 440. Accidents in night operations remained high.Murray 1983, p. 55. I and II Gruppe lost a bomber to ground fire on the night of 17 October.Mason 1969, pp. 450 I./KG 1 persisted with attacks on airfields attacking RAF Horsham St Faith and RAF West Raynham on 27 and 29 October. I Gruppe received support from III./KG 1, and both groups lost a bomber each night.Mason 1969, pp. 461, 465. II./KG 1 bombed airfields in the Norwich area on 29 October. II. and III. Gruppen began wholesale conversion to the Ju 88 at the end of October 1940.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, pp. 17, 19. The Blitz The night offensive over Britain began, in earnest, in the month of October 1940. The Germans utilised navigational aids such as Knickebein, X-Ger√§t and Y-Ger√§t. The systems allowed the German bombers to navigate to target cities hundreds of miles from their bases. Pathfinder aircraft, from KG 55 and Kampfgruppe 100, were also used to guide the bomber stream to the target area. RAF night fighters were equipped with Airborne interception radar, but very few in number. All three Gruppen of KG 1 were involved in bombing London on 1/2 November 1940 and carried out their assignment as the lead bomber formation that night (20:00‚Äì20:50). 76, KG 77, I. and II./LG 1, I./KG 27, 1./KG 54, II./KG 54, KGr 806, I./KG 55, II./KG 55, III./KG 55 supported the bombing operation.Goss 2010, p. 212. Other targets were bombed elsewhere this night. returned to London on 4/5 November. III Gruppe bombed Swanton Morley and West Raynham on 5 November. On night of the 6/7 November KG 1 was involved in the first and last waves of bombings from dusk till dawn. I./KG 1 attacked the city from 19:30‚Äì21:15 while II./KG 1 completed its attacks between 06:12 and 07:15.Goss 2010, p. 213. On 7 November II./KG 1 targeted Bacton‚ÄìNorwich railway line. II. Gruppe bombed London again on 7/8 November while 7 Staffel bombed Honington on 8 November. On 9 November, in the early hours, KG 1 led I. and III./KG 77 to bomb Birmingham. It was KG 1's first operation in the Birmingham Blitz. The following night, 9/10 November, KG 1 flew two operations, both in full strength, against London.Goss 2010, p. 214. In the early hours of 12 November I./KG 1 carried out five operations, the only group of KG 1 to do so. It bombed Brighton, London, Worthing, Dover and Horsham. III./KG 1 did the same on 13 November, against Woodford in Gloucester and Newton Heath. On 14/15 November KG 1 flew in full strength in a highly effective attack on Coventry, codenamed Operation Mondscheinsonate (Moonlight Sonata). I Gruppe flew three further operations: against Eastbourne, Newhaven and Ramsgate.Goss 2010, pp. 46‚Äì49, 215. \\"Pathfinders\\" from 12 Kampfgruppe 100 (Bomb Group 100 or KGr 100) led 437 bombers from KG 1, KG 3, KG 26, KG 27, KG 55 and LG 1 and they dropped of high explosive, of incendiaries, and 127 parachute mines.Shores 1985, p. 57. Other sources say 449 bombers and a total of of bombs were dropped.Hooton 1997, p. 35. The raid against Coventry was particularly devastating, and led to widespread use of the phrase \\"to conventrate\\". Ju 88 preparing for night operations, 1941. 1 began conversion to this type in October 1940. London was targeted again on 15/16 November while KG 1 flew a full-strength bombing attack against Hastings. On 16/17 November two three-Gruppen attacks were made against London while I./KG 1 bombed Birmingham and Coventry again on 18/19 November. On 19/20 and 20/21 November KG 1 bombed Birmingham again with all three groups. I Gruppe flew a second sortie to London while all three groups attacked an airfield in the north of London.Goss 2010, pp. 216‚Äì217. KG 1 mounted particularly heavy air attacks on 22/23 November. It flew one full- strength operation against Birmingham and London. A third operation was carried out against Portsmouth, although Eastney and Eastleigh were hit instead. A fourth mission was flown against Eastbourne. On 24/24 November KG 1 turned to bombing Bristol, Birmingham and Coventry.Goss 2010, p. 218. On 27/28 and 28/29 November KG 1 began all-group attacks over Plymouth and Liverpool; London (29/30 November), Bristol (2/3 December), Birmingham, London (3/4 December) by I./KG 1, Birmingham and Sheerness (11/12 December), Sheffield and Ramsgate (12/13 December), London (21/22 December and 22/23 December) with I. and III./KG 1 respectively, Manchester and London (23/24 December). 1 bombed London again on 29/30 December, a night which is referred to as the Second Great Fire of London because of the damaged caused by the Luftwaffe.Goss 2010, pp. 219‚Äì225. Over 27,499 incendiaries and over 100 tonnes of bombs were dropped on London by 136 aircraft that night which caused a firestorm devastated the old City of London.Wakefield 1999, pp. 92‚Äì103. The Luftwaffe targeted ports in January 1941.,Wakefield 1999, p. 104. In February port- targets became top priority, but planners persisted in operating against cities in the interior.Hooton 2010, p. 88. III Gruppe bombed Cardiff and Salisbury on 2/3 January, Dungeness (3/4 January), Hastings (9/10 January), Portsmouth (10/11 January), Southampton (19/20 January). III Gruppe completed January operations with bombing operations against Stechford, The Wash, twice on 22 January, Stetchford‚ÄìMargate‚ÄìHayes and Portsmouth on 28 January. On 29 and 30 January 1941 III Gruppe bombed Newcastle and then Stechford and London respectively.Goss 2010, pp. 225‚Äì229. Night operations were complicated at this time with the emergence of Wing Commander Edward Addison's No. 80 Wing RAF which was dedicated to the jamming of high-frequency German beams; though the success of British countermeasures in 1940 and 1941 were minimal.Wakefield 1999, pp. 108. KG 1 used III Gruppe to maintain pressure on Plymouth and Birmingham on 9/10 February. It was the only group operational that night. Stab and I./KG 1 flew against London on 14/15 February. Before midnight on 17 November, Sternford and Leominster were bombed; again III./KG 1 was the only element to fly operations. On 19/20 February KG 1 flew a full-strength attack on Southampton with KG 28, and also alone against Brighton. Port-operations were maintained on 20/21 with an attack on Swansea, Portsmouth, Eastbourne and Cardiff; a further all-out effort against Brighton, Cardiff and Southampton was made on 26/27 February.Goss 2010, p. 231. KG 1 remained on operations into March 1941. Cardiff was bombed III./KG 1 on 1/2 March and by I./KG 1 on 3/4 March. Southampton was bombed by I and III Gruppe on 3/4 March. London was attacked by I Gruppe on 8/9 and 9/10 March and by III./KG 1 on the latter date. I and III Gruppen also bombed Portsmouth on consecutive nights from 9‚Äì11 March. III Gruppe continued operation on 12/13 March against Liverpool, Eastbourne and Brighton. With first group, it made the Geschwader's first contribution to the Glasgow Blitz on 13/14 March; the group also attacked Margate, Grantham and Alton. I and II Gruppen flowed suite on 14/15 March, while I./KG 1 bombed Southampton. II./KG 1 completed the night's operations with an attack on Chatham. 1 continued to support the bombing operations and flew in the Hull Blitz for the first time on 18/19 March while I./KG 1 targeted Harwell.Goss 2010, pp. 231-236. KG 1 began April with an attack on Birmingham by third group on first night and Poole on the night of the 3rd and 4th. II./KG 1 were busiest on the night of 7/8; bombing Liverpool, Bristol and Glasgow. They were supported by III./KG 1 in the latter operation. 1 focused on the West Midlands; bombing Coventry and Birmingham from 8/9 to 10/11 April. On 15/16 April III and II Gruppen attacked Belfast, Northern Ireland for the first time. From 16‚Äì29 April London, Liverpool and Plymouth were the main targets for all three Gruppen.Goss 2010, pp. 236-242. On the night of the 19/20 April, Adolf Hitler's 52nd birthday, London was attacked by 712 aircraft, the largest deployment of the month. It surpassed the 685 aircraft used on the 16/17 April attack.Wakefield 1999, p. 130. In May, aside from previous targets, KG 1 was deployed against Great Yarmouth twice, and Hull, (3/4 May), Woodley (4/5 May), and Newcastle on 6/7 May with KG 76. From 8‚Äì10 May KG bombed Nottingham twice, and Upper Heyford. On 11/12 April II./KG 1 bombed Watton and Sutton Bridge. From 19‚Äì27 May Ipswich, Lowestoft, Harwich, Dover, Hunstanton were bombed. 1's last Blitz operation came on 1/2 June 1941, when II Gruppe assisted in a large attack on Manchester.Goss 2010, pp. 242-247. Eastern Front KG 1 was relocated Powunden, East Prussia in early June 1941. Stab. II., and III./KG 1 were assigned to General der Flieger Helmuth F√∂rster, commanding Fliegerkorps I. The air corps was subordinated to Luftflotte 1 under Generaloberst Alfred Keller. Keller's command existed to support the attack of Army Group North into the Soviet Union.Bergstr√∂m 2007a, p. 129. The invasion, codenamed Operation Barbarossa, began on 22 June 1941. The noticeable exception was I./KG 1. The Gruppe was sent to begin training for maritime interdiction for Battle of the Atlantic in March 1941. On 1 April 1941 it was re-designated I./KG 40. It would not be reformed until 8 June 1942. II. Gruppe reported 27 from 29 Ju 88s operational and the third group, 29 from 30. On the first day, KG 1, with KG 76 and KG 77 rendered critical air support to XXXXI Panzer Corps under the command of Georg-Hans Reinhardt. The German tank force was engaged by forces led by Fedor Kuznetsov. Kuznetsov ordered the mobilisation of the Baltic Military District (later named the Northwestern Front) to defend the Baltic States, annexed by the Red Army in 1939. The 3rd and 12 Mechanised Corps moved to initiate a pincer movement as the Germans advanced on Siauliai. German air attacks destroyed 40 motor vehicles or tanks. The 23rd Tank Division and 12th Mechanised Corps sustained particularly heavy losses. Over the next three days, as the battle raged, the medium bomber force was asked to provide close air support because Luftflotte 1 lacked such aircraft. All three bomber groups suffered the collective loss of 18 aircraft to heavy Soviet anti-aircraft artillery.Bergstr√∂m 2007a, p. 22. Keller was forced to repeat these operations on 28 June. Southwest of Riga, KG 1 lost six Ju 88s this way.Bergstr√∂m 2007a, p. 29. KG 1 was moved to Mitau, a forward base in the Daugavpils‚ÄìRiga area, to support the 4th Panzer Army's breakout from the Daugavpils bridgehead.Bergstr√∂m 2007a, p. 31. A notable loss for KG 1 was the commander of second group, Otto Stams, who was wounded in action on 27 June. Stams was replaced by Emil Enderle. III Gruppe was heavily involved in operations. It bombed Red Air Force airfields at Ventspils, Liep√§ja, Jelgava and Riga from 27‚Äì28 June. From 1‚Äì4 July it bombed Soviet troop concentrations at Jelgava and over southern Latvia. After the capture of Jelgava it moved there on 5 July to support attacks on airfields in Estonia. The group also interdicted rail lines between Lake Ilmen and Lake Peipus.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 20. The group attack Luga on 10 July. On this day a formation from KG 1 was intercepted by Polikarpov I-16s from 154 IAP. Pilot Sergey Titovka carried out a taran attack on Feldwebel Paul Kempf's bomber. 1 reported the loss of three Ju 88s.Bergstr√∂m 2007a, p. 34. II./KG 1 carried out similar operations and it bombed Leningrad on 3 July. It extended its sphere of operations into the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland, attacking Soviet shipping and the Baltic Fleet. Both groups moved to Saborovka. It focused on rail and road targets near Bologoye on 23 July while supporting the general advance to Leningrad. Attacks against Soviet shipping took priority in late August: between Narva and Kronstadt. In September attacks on naval traffic on Lake Ladoga and in the Gulf of Finland became the focus of KG 1's operations. KG 1 was also active against the Soviet evacuation of Tallinn. On 28 August KG 77 and KGr 806 sank the 2,026 grt steamer Vironia, the 2,317 grt Lucerne, the 1,423 grt Atis Kronvalds and the ice breaker Kri≈°jƒÅnis ValdemƒÅrs (2,250 grt). The rest of the Soviet fleet were forced to change course. This took them through a heavily mined area. As a result, 21 Soviet warships, including five destroyers, struck mines and sank. On 29 August, the Ju 88s accounted for the transport ships Vtoraya Pyatiletka (3,974 grt), Kalpaks (2,190 grt) and Leningradsovet (1,270 grt) sunk. In addition, the ships Ivan Papanin, Saule, Kazakhstan and the Serp i Molot were damaged by I./KG 4, which also sank three more. Some 5,000 Soviet soldiers died.Bergstr√∂m 2007a, p. 60. KG 1 was also active in the Luftwaffe's traditional interdiction role. Gerhard Baeker's III./KG 1 severed the rail lines to Luga on 16 August. The success of the attack forced the Soviets to abandon Kingisepp.Bergstr√∂m 2007a, p. 59. II Gruppe was removed from the front on 12 September to re-equip with the Ju 88A-4 until 9 October. All remaining aircraft were handed over to III./KG 1. As Army Group North neared Leningrad, all the bombers of the first air fleet began bombing operations against the centre of the city: beginning the Siege of Leningrad. On 8 September 27 Ju 88s dropped 6, 327 incendiary bombs, starting 183 fires. The targets were the Badayevo warehouses holding supplies for the trapped Soviet forces and the city's civilians. An entire reserve of sugar weighting 2,500 tons was destroyed. Bombing commenced around the clock, a systematic attempt to destroy the city. Most air raids were confined to the night, because of heavy ground fire and the arrival of 5, 7, 44 and 191 IAP fighter regiments.Bergstr√∂m 2007a, p. 82. On 28 September and into early October operations against rail lines in the Lake Ilmen. It moved to Dno airbase on 17 October. It continued interdiction, or disruption, operations against Tikhvin (29 October), Yaroslavl (31 October), Shum (19 December) and Chudovo on 29 December 1941. II. Gruppe returned to Saborovka on 9 October and bombed rail lines southeast of Leningrad from 9‚Äì13 October. It moved to Staraya Russa on 23rd. It was in action over Bolshoi-Dvor lines on 17 December. Both groups fought against Soviet counteroffensives in the Lake Ilmen area until the end of December, and the ultimate failure of Barbarossa. Before the year was out, II./KG 1 lost its second commander, Emil Enderle, posted missing in action on 3 November. To Stalingrad II. and III. Gruppen remained on operations opposing the Soviet winter offensives. On 2 January, with KG 4, it bombed the ice roads and unloading port of Osinovets.Bergstr√∂m & Mikhailov 2001, p. 60. In January 1942, 1 bombed targets around Staraya Russa, Kholm and the Volkhov River into February and until 20 March. From 26 March‚Äì3 April 1942, KG 1 flew bombing and supply missions over the Demyansk Pocket. Luftflotte 1 carried out 3,185 sorties in the first month of 1942. 1 and I./KG 4 flew 913 bomber sortied in the Volkhov and 473 in the Demyansk area.Bergstr√∂m & Mikhailov 2001, p. 66. The wing commenced Operation Eisstoss, against Kronshtadt port on 4 April and continued to support trapped German Army units in the Kholm Pocket. 1 remained mostly active around Kholm‚Äìparticularly in opposition to the Toropets‚ÄìKholm Offensive‚Äìand the Volkhov front in April and May 1942, with sporadic attacks on Lake Ilmen (22 April) Leningrad (24 April). II./KG 1 returned to Germany to rest and refit in May. III./KG 1 retained a small contingent at Pskov, but moved to Insterburg, East Prussia on 21 April. The group returned rapidly and were apparently in the Kholm area by 30 April. III. Gruppe moved to Rozhkopolve from 21 May to 1 June. By 8 June the group was back at Dno with II Gruppe. I./KG 1 was re- created on 8 June at L√ºbeck-Blankensee but was sent to Avord in France. From there it flew night operations over Great Britain from 5 August (Baedeker Blitz), including bombing operations against the Dieppe Raid. The group returned to the Eastern Front on 3 September 1942. That same day Geschwaderkommodore Hans Keppler was killed in action and replaced with Heinrich Lau. From 22 June 1942 II./KG 1 flew armed reconnaissance over the Gulf Finland. In July 1942 the group moved to Bryansk on Army Group Centre's front. Several Staffeln flew anti-tank operations. from 10 to 27 July. Within the same timeframe, 11 to 16 July, it attacked rail, troop and tank concentrations in the Sukhinichi, Kozelsk and Belev sectors. By 20 July the group was operating in the Pola River and combated Soviet breakthroughs in the Battles of Rzhev from 7 August 1942. Acting as fire-brigade support in the north, the group supported Operation Wirbelwind; a counteroffensive east of Roslavl near Sukhinichi from 9‚Äì27 August. By 20 September it could must 10 operational Ju 88s, from the 26 available to it. III./KG 1 repeated these operations but spent slightly longer operating over Bryansk (7‚Äì27 July) and Operation Wirbelwind. In September it flew support for the army in Demyansk and Lake Ilmen, before moving to Morosovskaya on 6 October, to support Operation Blue, and Army Group South in the Battle of Stalingrad before withdrawing to East Prussia again on 31 October. II. Gruppen was joined by I./KG 1 in the south under the command of Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VIII. The first group returned to the East and began operations over the familiar Demyansk area. Its operational condition was better than the other Gruppen and it could employ 21 of the 33 Ju 88s available to it. On 7 October both groups began operations over Stalingrad and the northern Caucasus. It bombed Grozny on 10 October and Stalingrad on 16th before being removed to the Orsha on the central sector, and subordinated to Fliegerdivision 1 on 3 November. KG 1 responded to Richthofen's 14 October call for an all-out attack on the city. In 2,000 sorties the Germans dropped a total of 600 tons of bombs. 1 lost three Ju 88s.Bergstr√∂m 2007b, pp. 84‚Äì85. II./KG 1 was pushed deeper in the south as the Battle of the Caucasus reached a climax. It bombed Astrakhan on 18 October but was withdrawn to Orsha on the same day as I./KG 1. Consequently, KG 1 missed the final stages of the battle which ended in the destruction of Axis armies in Stalingrad. Nevertheless, II./KG 1 lost Gruppenkommandeur Heinz Laube killed in an accident on 8 December. Final operations in the East I Gruppe returned under the command of Oberstleutnant Hellmut Schalke until July when Major Werner Dahlke took command. It was rushed into action in the Rzhev sector into November. On 26 November 1942, 1 flew its 20,000th mission. In December 1942 it fought in the Battle for Velikiye Luki. From Orsha, it moved to Kharkov and Volchenko on 25 December to bolster the defences on the Don River. It abandoned the area on 17 January 1943 to avoid being overrun. During the transfer it moved to IV Fliegerkorps and conducted a fighting withdrawal against infantry and tank targets. Based at Kiev, from 5 February, the group flew in the Third Battle of Kharkov. It also operated from Poltava Air Base before moving north, to Kolty near Narva. On consecutive nights from 19 to 21 March, the airfield was bombed costing two Ju 88s destroyed and four damaged. The group bombed targets around Lake Ladoga from 23 March and left the Soviet Union until May 1944. II./KG 1 carried out similar operations, differing only in its earlier retirement to K√∂nigsberg for rest and refit from 19 to 30 December. The group did not return to the Eastern Front until June 1944. III./KG 1 handed its aircraft to II Gruppe when it left for East Prussia on 31 October 1942. It returned in January 1943 and remained on the Eastern Front until July. Hauptmann Werner Kanther became the last-but one commanding officer in October 1942; he held command until the first disbandment of the unit in April 1944. On 9 March, (Eis)/KG 1 was created. It was equipped with the Ju 88C and trained for specialised train-busting operations. It remained supporting Army Group North until June 1943 until it was transferred to Luftflotte 6. It served on the Volkhov, Kolpino and Kholm. It assisted German forces hold the line at Krasny Bor after the Battle of Krasny Bor. On 2 June KG 1 bombed the rail station at Kursk, in preparation for Operation Citadel; it also bombed Leninsky, Yelets and Voronezh. The command staff of the Luftwaffe used this idea to free their service from the air support role. Robert Ritter von Greim's Luftflotte 6, with support from Luftflotte 4, was assigned seven bomber wings to carry out a strategic bombing offensiveMuller 1992, p. 114.‚ÄîKG 55, KG 3, KG 4, KG 27, KG 51, KG 53 and KG 100.Bergstr√∂m 2007c, p. 19. Factory Number No. 466 at Gorkiy with five percent total and one-tenth of all fighter engine production were the targets.Muller 1992, p. 115. Three of the five ball bearings plants were in range, the synthetic rubber plant at Yaroslavl (23 percent of output) and oil refineries along with steel plants were all considered. Surviving intelligence maps show the crude oil and ball bearing plant at Saratov was also considered.Muller 1992, pp. 116-115. In the end phase, the production of tanks and armoured vehicles received the weight of the attacks. The facilities at Gorkiy drew most attention for it produced 15 percent of T-34s and was the largest plant west of the Urals. In error, planners targeted the State Motor Vehicles Plant No. 1 Molotov, the largest automobile plant in the country which produced the less threatening T-60 and T-70. The Krasnoye Sormovo Factory No. 112 was targeted because of its production of munitions.Muller 1992, p. 117. The He 177. 1 was the only unit to use large numbers on the Eastern Front.Bergstr√∂m 2008, p. 62. Third group was the only element of KG 1 to take part, from 5 to 8 June. It bombed the synthetic rubber plant on 20 June. It lost two aircraft.Bergstr√∂m 2007c, p. 24. During repeated attacks between 4 and 22 June, all of the plant's 50 buildings, 9,000 metres of conveyors, 5,900 units of process equipment and 8,000 engines were destroyed or damaged.Bergstr√∂m 2007c, p. 24. Russian authorities have still not disclosed how many people were killed.Bergstr√∂m 2007c, p. 20. German wartime estimates are 15,000, but are not supported. Owing to failed intelligence and targeting, the attacks against the Molotov factory disrupted the T-70 light tank. Roughly half of the Soviet light tank production‚Äî5, 134 from 9, 375 in 1942, was made there. Factory Number 112, produced the T-34 tank, which was only lightly affected by the raids. Repair was rapid, and completed within six weeks. Night fighter and search light defences were also increased. The factory was fully operational by 18 August. In the fourth quarter of 1943, it superseded production quotas by 121 percent. When Citadel began III./KG 1 carried out bombing operations until 13 July. It moved to Bryansk on 14 July and attacked Soviet armour when Operation Kutuzov broke through to Orel on 20 July. The Gruppe lingered on the Eastern Front until 2 August 1943, when it appears to have been withdrawn. Only the specialist 9.(Eis)/KG 1 Staffel remained. On 20 July it moved back to Seshchinskaya and operated from Stari Bykhov from 18 September. In October 1943 it helped Army Group Centre contain the Orsha offensives. It may have been transferred to Flensburg to convert to the Ju 88P. In mid-March it was re-designated 14(Eis)./KG 3. III Gruppe disbanded in mid-April 1944. 7 and 8 Staffeln re known to have retrained as anti-tank units at Flensburg until 12 August and the aircraft were given to 9.(Eis)./KG 1. Only one month later, the Gruppe was reformed by the re- designation of I./KG 100. It began training on the Heinkel He 177 but never became operational again. It was dissolved at Prowehren East Prussia, on 25 August 1944. II./KG 1 returned to the front under the command of IV Fliegerkorps after action in Italy and the Mediterranean. Equipped with the He 177s, the bomber group flew against railheads from June 1944, as the Soviet summer offensive opened. It was ordered by Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring to attack tanks and act as close air support. Using the heavy bomber in this way was disastrous: Oberstleutnant Horst von Riesen carried out the orders with reluctance and lost two on the 26th, another two on 27th and a fifth bomber on 28 June.Bergstr√∂m 2008, p. 64. It bombed rail yards at Kalinkovichi and Gomel, and at Velikaya Luki on 26 June. Fuel shortages forced the group to be withdrawn and disbanded on 28 July at Brandis. Flight personnel were sent to I./JG 7, operating the Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter jet. It was formally renamed I./JG 7 on 5 September 1944. In July KG 1 made its last substantial contribution in Lithuania. It counted the Soviet Vilnius Offensive and slowed preparations for the Kaunas Offensive. The Soviet supply base at Molodechno, southeast of Vilnius, at Minsk, Velikiye Luki and Novosokolniki were repeatedly attacked by night bombers. On 20 July Riesen led all 70 of KG 1's operational He 177 bombers on a daylight raid against Velikiye Luki rail station. Riesen flew so high Soviet fighter aircraft could not intercept and the bombing caused mass devastation to the station and town for no loss. On 23 July, the crews struck again and reported large fires and explosions after bombing Molodechno.Bergstr√∂m 2008, p. 76. KG 1 was ordered to disrupt Soviet rail traffic in the Lublin sector‚Äîto contain the Lublin‚ÄìBrest Offensive. On 25 July the He 177s repeated effective attacks. At the Bug River, near Brest- Litovsk, the bombers destroyed the headquarters of the Soviet 80th Army Corps, killing the commander in the process. On 28 July KG 1 carried out its last bombing mission of the war when it attacked concentrations of the 2nd Guards Tank Army.Bergstr√∂m 2008, p. 78. I./KG 1 remained in Laon, France from April and June 1943 before serving in Italy. It also began training on He 177s from September 1943 and handed its Ju 88s to KG 54 and KG 76. At Burg from 18 November 1943, it made slow progress and suffered many accident losses from 15 March. By the end of April it could field 22 He 177s. Considered operational, it transferred to East Prussia at Prowehren and Seerappen in June. In June and July it attacked Soviet tank formations and on one operation, under the command of Major Manfred von Cossart, nearly bombed Adolf Hitler's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair. It disbanded at Brandis on 20 August 1944 and personnel were sent to JG 7. Italian Campaign and the Mediterranean KG 1 was rushed to Piacenza in June 1943 after the North African Campaign ended with the defeat of Axis forces. From here I./KG 1 was moved to Viterbo on 10 July. The Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) provided the bomber group with the immediate task of destroying Allied shipping the Mediterranean. From this date it attacked harbours in Algeria and Tunisia. It moved further south to Foggia on 26 July, but serviceability was poor: just five of the 18 Ju 88s were operational by 20 August 1943. Bombing operations over Syracuse (17, 22 July), Augusta harbour (21 July), Malta (22 July), Gela (27 July), Palermo (4 August) and Syracuse again on 10 August degraded operational readiness. The Allied invasion of Italy took place on 3 September and I./KG 1 recorded its last sortie off Naples on 8 September. II./KG 1 arrived in Grottaglie on 28 March and was subordinated to Fliegerkorps II, subordinated to Luftflotte 2. It flew supply operations to Tunisia in an attempt to overcome the effects of Operation Flax. It also flew anti-submarine warfare operations and aerial escort for convoys from 10 to 27 April 1943. It bombed B≈ène harbour on 15 May, days after the Battle of Tunisia ended in the capitulation of Axis forces. It also bombed Oran harbour and then moved to Sardinia on 19 May. From June to August to flew against the landing in Sicily and the invasion of Italy, mainly in anti-shipping roles which decimated the group. Based at Foggia on 20 August 1943, it had 11 operational to 21 Ju 88s on strength. On 9 September it handed its aircraft to KG 54 and KG 76. The personnel temporarily acted as occupation forces near Airasca, Torino, when Italy changes sides before departing Italy for the last time on 4 November 1943 for conversion to the He 177 at Burg.

Its work is centered on critical play an approach that uses games and play to investigate and explain ideas. Outcomes from the lab's work range from scholarly papers and conference presentations to video games, urban games, board games, and performances. Tiltfactor's motto is \\"Game Design for Social Change.\\" Tiltfactor is engaged in producing games that combat biases and stereotypes against women in STEM; increase systems-level thinking; model effective bystander intervention in cases of sexual assault; facilitate open source metadata gathering for public institutions; create social networks to encourage altruism and prosocial behavior; and inspire new ways of thinking about health care delivery. They develop board games, card games, sports, urban games, and digital games for a variety of platforms, and publish both qualitative and quantitative research results from their controlled empirical studies. As of September 2012, Tiltfactor is located in the Black Family Visual Arts Center at Dartmouth. Tiltfactor is supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, Microsoft Research, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the National Science Foundation, among others. History In 2003, Mary Flanagan founded the Tiltfactor Lab while a professor at Hunter College in New York City. Tiltfactor was the first academic game research lab in New York and early work included Rapunsel, a video game to teach young girls computer programming developed in collaboration with researchers at New York University. In 2008 Tiltfactor moved to Dartmouth College when Dr. Flanagan accepted her position as Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor in Digital Humanities.Concord Monitor article about Flanagan's move Selected games Tiltfactor develops games in a variety of media for different audiences. Some of their games include: POX: SAVE THE PEOPLE ‚Äì a board game for 1 to 4 people. Players take turns vaccinating or curing members of a population against a disease outbreak. Through play, players understand group immunity and the need to vaccinate. thumb buffalo ‚Äì a 20-minute party game where the objective is to name-drop faster than your friends and collect the most cards to win. The game was developed as part of a National Science Foundation funded project called ‚ÄúTransforming Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) For Women and Girls: Reworking Stereotypes & Bias.‚Äù The two-year grant has allowed Tiltfactor to develop a number of game designs with additional assistance from the National Girls Collaborative Project, a nationwide organization that wishes to promote gender equity within STEM fields. Awkward Moment ‚Äì the game puts 3‚Äì8 players in awkward social situations. Players gather a hand of reactions cards and together face embarrassing, or stressful events. Players use decider cards to determine the basis for a winning reaction. ZOMBIEPOX ‚Äì A zombie version of Pox, Zombiepox spreads as zombies wander through town biting people. Players help the humans escape by vaccinating them, winning the game if the disease can no longer spread and losing if too many people become full- blown zombies. POX: Save the Puppies ‚Äì An extension of the POX game model, Save the Puppies is an Android game for 1‚Äì5 players in which players fight the spread of a disease that threatens to take over our pet dog populations. The game is based on the way a typical disease spreads, and players must work to contain the spread of infection by either vaccinating or curing puppies. While the game's disease is fictitious, it is based on a very real disease, Canine parvovirus. Metadata Games ‚Äì A collection of online casual games designed to help digital archivists organize visual libraries. Players tag photos, helping to increase the usefulness of image libraries.Metadata Games grant approval Entangled - a virtual reality video game where players take on the role of Dr. Smith, a physicist in a science fiction world who can manipulate objects in multiple dimensions. The player uses their skills to travel through the same science lab but in many different dimensions, escaping pursuit by a shadowy enemy. Entangled has been played at the 2019 BostonFIG Fest. The Enchanter - a digital, point-and-click adventure computer game. Players take on the role of Gertie, a potion-making character, in a fictional world where she encounters and overcomes a range of gender-related obstacles. Replay Health ‚Äì a role- playing sport where players must balance performing physical activities to score points with trying to monitor and improve their character's health. The game takes less than an hour to play, and it fosters player empathy and understanding for the many major decision points in the healthcare system. Leechwyves and Bonesetters ‚Äì an active roleplaying game in which players combat plague in medieval Europe, play groups work collaboratively to make their fiefdom the wealthiest and least plague-ridden in the land. Players are assigned characters with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each round, they must balance the goal of working their manor lord‚Äôs land with the need to visit the leechwyfe or the bonesetter to keep themselves plague-free. Layoff ‚Äì players assume the role of corporate management planning jobs cuts. In a mechanic similar to Bejewled, players match identical types of workers in groups in order to lay the workers off and increase profits. Layoff was developed in collaboration with the Rochester Institute of Technology and launched in the spring of 2009 amid significant economic turbulence in the United States. The game garnered significant attention and was played over a million times within its first week.Layoffs: The Video Game Is Depressing Fun, Kotaku Vexata ‚Äì Tiltfactor's first board game is designed to help middle school students develop their game literacy. Players move around the board landing on different category spaces that express either positive values such as \\"cooperation\\" or negative ideas such as \\"prejudice.\\" Each square has a game mechanic associated with it that expresses its particular value or idea. By moving around the game board, players experience and learn how game mechanics can express ideas and values. Massively Multiplayer Mushu ‚Äì players use food to explore new neighborhoods, languages and cultures. Players have a number of cards with ingredients written in a variety of languages other than English. To discover what the ingredients are, players must approach strangers and ask them to help translate the ingredients. Points can also be accumulated by interviewing strangers about food-related stories and opinions, and even by convincing a stranger to return to the post-game dinner. MMM and MMS have been played at the 2008 Conflux festival, the 2009 Come Out & Play festival, and on their own.Come Out & Play announcement of MMM Grow-A-Game ‚Äì Developed as part of the Values At Play project, Grow-A-Game cards are a game and game design tool that help novices understand how games express ideas and help designers be more intentional about the ideas their games communicate.Brainy Gamer article about Grow-A-Game Cards Also available for iPad and iPhone. The Adventures of Josie True ‚Äì Though its development began in 1999, years before Dr. Flanagan founded Tiltfactor, The Adventures of Josie True has continued to be maintained by Tiltfactor. The game was designed with four goals in mind: to increase the time 9 to 11-year-old girls spend using technology, promote heroes from under-represented groups, increase math and science skills, and change misconceptions about math, science, and technology in order to encourage girls to pursue those fields. Evaluation indicated that it accomplished its goals, effectively changing players' attitudes and increasing their interest in math, science and technology.New York Times article about Josie True Selected Research Projects Using the critical play methodology, Tiltfactor investigates games and play culture, uses games and play as research tools, and designs games and playful events based on findings from research. Some of Tiltfactor's research projects include, but are not limited too: Tiltfactor‚Äôs Bias project Transforming STEM For Women and Girls: Reworking Stereotypes & Bias is based on recent research which reveals the measures people and institutions can take to alter unconscious societal biases regarding girls‚Äô achievements and interest in pursuing STEM-related careers. Metadata Games Metadata games is a software development project in which Tiltfactor researched and created an open source game system that utilizes the idea of crowd-sourcing. Groups of people compete against one another to tag data for archives, libraries, and repositories. Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies. Interrupt! Health Games The Interrupt! series of games is designed to encourage physical activity and promote healthy behavior. Research in conjunction with the Dartmouth Psychiatric Research Center studies how games can be used as tools for increasing health issue awareness and healthy behavior specifically relating to HIV/AIDS, mental health, and disease prevention. Values At Play In collaboration with researchers at NYU, this National Science Foundation funded project has produced college curricula, workshops, a game design competition, and tools to explore \\"values conscious\\" game design.Grand Text Auto blog post on VAP site launch Selected publications Tiltfactor has also published a number of research papers and studies on game and play culture. Some of these works include: Values At Play In collaboration with researchers at NYU, Tiltfactor studies the ways in which games communicate social, political, and moral values.

A former telephone worker with Ohio Bell and later AT&T;, Key initially ran for the Ohio House of Representatives in 2000 to succeed Troy Lee James, who had held the seat for 34 years and no longer could run due to term limits. She succeeded in her bid, and was seated on January 3, 2001. She would go on to win reelection in 2002, and 2004. By her second term, Key was serving as the ranking Democratic member on the Ethics and Elections Committee. In 2006, Key opted to forgo another term in the House to run for the Ohio Senate in an open seat. However, with the seat being incredibly Democratic, she faced a contentious primary against Shirley Smith and Claudette Woodard. In the end, Smith defeated Key, ultimately ending her political career in Columbus. She was succeeded by her aide, Democrat Sandra Williams. Following her defeat, Key returned to Cleveland and remains active in the community. Her daughter, Stephanie Howse, currently serves in the Ohio House representing the 11th District - Key's former district. References External links *The Ohio Ladies Gallery: Rep. Annie L.

At international level, he represented the Italy national football team at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Style of play Considered to be a highly talented player in his youth, Iorio was a diminutive forward, who was highly regarded for his speed, creativity, dribbling skills, and technical ability, which enabled him to get past more physically imposing players. However, he was also known to be inconsistent, due to his poor work-rate and undisciplined lifestyle off the pitch. He often played as a deep-lying forward behind a main centre-forward, due to his ability to provide assists, although he was also known for his eye for goal, and had a tendency to score decisive goals for his teams.

The film is based on a screenplay from Malcolm Kohll and Gordon Render.The Bone Snatcher (2002) ‚Äì A Review by David Nusair Plot When workers begin disappearing in a South African mine, Dr. Straker and a search team are sent into the desert to find out why the geologists of a diamond expedition have lost radio contact. They arrive at camp of the scientists in the desert, but soon find the neatly gnawed bones of their colleagues and a trail that leads them to a strange rock formation. Once at camp they find only the cleanly gnawed bones of the workers. Soon it becomes clear that there is a murderous beast on the loose. The researchers decided to investigate the structure, but in the gathering darkness, sheer hell breaks loose as the creature, composed of a swarm of ant-like insects wrapped around the bones of its victims, hunts them for their bones. A game of cat and mouse continues through the desert, with the team being slowly picked off and the bug and bone monster eventually being chased down in a derelict mine. Zack finds it hard to decide to kill the yellow queen brain that controls the swarm that has killed dozens of people, but he eventually does so. Suddenly, the derelict mine structure starts to fall down, leaving Zack and Mikki to run back to the truck - where they find they are now the only survivors of the team. The film ends with Mikki driving into the distance, apparently oblivious that a box loaded into her taxi contains another queen brain. Cast Production The film was shot in the year 2002 in the South African city Cape Town and in the desert from Namibia.The Bone Snatcher ‚Äì Movie Review Release The Bone Snatcher was released on DVD by First Look Pictures on December 23, 2003.The Bone Snatcher Dracula's Curse DVD review- Acid Logic ezine It was re-released by Anchor Bay Entertainment on July 26 the following year.

Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 0%, based on , with a rating average of 2.8/10. David Nusair of ReelFilm Reviews awarded the film a negative 1 out of a possible 4 stars, writing, \\"More than anything else, The Bone Snatcher is just dull. There's barely enough material here to fill a 15-minute short, let alone a 90-minute feature - and for a horror film, it's shockingly non- horrific\\". Wayne Southworth of The Spinning Image gave the film 4/10 stars, criticizing the garbled language, which made understanding what the actor's were saying difficult. Southworth, however, commended the film's desert location as the best thing about the movie.

The album was recorded in March 1997 and was released later that year. The band felt dissatisfied with the final result of the album, and in 2003 re-recorded them for their fourth album, Dumb Loud Hollow Twang Deluxe. Background Dumb Loud Hollow Twang was recorded in one marathon three-hour session on 30 March 1997. The band allegedly had to bribe a janitor in order to gain access to the recording studio. They played live, recording one take of each song. After each track had been recorded, the janitor who had been overseeing the sessions suddenly announced that he was leaving to celebrate Easter with his family. The band left the studio with their tape. When they listened to the tape, however, they discovered that one of drummer Hrvoje Zaborac's cymbals had been picked up on every instrument's channel. In an attempt to fix the problem, the band approached a producer, but this producer left in the middle of the sessions to work on another project. The band then contacted California DJ Phil Dirt, asking for assistance. They mailed their tapes to Dirt, who in turn mixed and mastered them. The band was satisfied with the production, but agreed that they could have performed each track better. The album was released in the autumn of 1997, on the Croatian label Dirty Old Town. A promotional tour of Croatia and Slovenia followed, and a music video for \\"Wanganui\\" and \\"Coastal Disturbance\\" was released that winter. The album was licensed to German label Kamikaze in 1998, where it went out of print by the end of the year. Their dissatisfaction with the recording of Dumb Loud Hollow Twang led them to create Dumb Loud Hollow Twang Deluxe in 2003, in which they re-recorded every song on the original album and added four additional songs.

Programs DSA-BC operates a fleet of eight specially designed Martin 16 sailboats from Jericho Sailing Centre. These are designed to enable people with all levels of disability to enjoy sailing as a recreation activity or competitive high performance endeavor. People with high-level disabilities, such as quadriplegia, have complete control of the vessel, with many sailing solo. Disabilities no bar to sailing The Star, January 3, 2008 Each sailing season, DSA-BC reports that it hosts between 800 and 1,000 sailing experiences at Jericho and more from its affiliated branches.

History Quadriplegic Sam Sullivan founded DSA-BC in 1989, using a British-made Sunbird dinghy. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had originally presented the boat to Rick Hansen during Expo '86 in Vancouver, celebrating his Man in Motion world tour. Hansen subsequently presented the boat to Sullivan in order that people with disabilities could benefit from it.Wind, Sun and Spray Abilities, Summer 1997 During its first summer, people with a range of disabilities logged a total of 22 sails. The major breakthrough for the sport came in 1993 with the addition of (mouth-operated) sip n‚Äô puff controls, which are connected to a power assist system. This enabled people with little or no arm movement to sail.The History of Disabled Sailing Association retrieved February 9, 2010 In 1995, the successor to the Sunbird was developed by Vancouver yacht designer Don Martin. The Martin 16 can be controlled conventionally, or by joystick, or through the sip n‚Äô puff interface. Equipment DSA-BC initially used the Sunbird, to which it added Sip n‚Äô Puff controls in 1993. However, the Sunbird's limitations could not be ignored, so Sullivan commissioned a new boat designed specifically for adaptive sailing. When Vancouver's Don Martin designed the Martin 16 in 1995, he included the requirements of power-assisted controls into his design brief.Martin 16 (boat reviews), Canadian Yachting, retrieved February 9, 2010 The weighted keel makes it a very safe and stable boat, but it is also responsive. The addition of a portable, modular sip n‚Äô puff system in 1998 ‚Äì which can be dropped into a boat when needed ‚Äì adds to the versatility of the vessel.

Lev Aristidovich Kasso (1865-1914) was an Imperial Russian politician. A Professor of Civil Law by education, he served as Imperial Minister of Education from 1910 through 1914 in the Stolypin and Kokovtsov governments. The State's university policy remained in Kasso's hands until his own death in 1914. The rift between the state and the professoriate continued to grow. In a move ostensibly made to train more professors and alleviate the serious problem of \\"vacant chairs,\\" Kasso proposed, in November 1911, the opening of special seminars for selected graduate students in Berlin, T√ºbingen, and Paris. Modeled on a similar scheme in the 1880s, Kasso's plan undermined the right of Russian professors to train their successors. To add insult to injury, the candidates would be chosen by the Ministry of Education rather than by the professors themselves. The Academy of Sciences labeled the scheme a \\"needless abasement of the dignity of Russian science.\\" But even in the face of intensely hostile public opinion, the Council of Ministers approved Kasso's scheme, albeit with a marked lack of enthusiasm. The shortage of qualified professors was one reason the minister of education cited for opposing requests from numerous zemstvos and cities for more universities. On 20 January 1911, the Council of Ministers ordered Kasso to report on the future direction of the nation's higher-education policy. The directive recognized a special need to expand facilities in higher technical education. On 9 February 1912, the Council of Ministers met to consider Kasso's conclusions. Kasso stated that there was a particular need for medical, veterinary, and agricultural education but argued against a general policy commitment to the expansion of higher education. The study group chaired by Kasso considered requests for new universities in Rostov and Tiflis; polytechnics in Samara, Perm, Ekaterinburg, and Nizhni Novgorod; the expansion of Tomsk University, and new veterinary institutes References *Out of My Past: The Memoirs of Count Kokovtsov Edited by H.H.

Small Axe was also the name of a CD issue 883717006523 in 2005 on the Pazzazz label. This features tracks from the Lee Perry sessions that spawned Soul Rebels and Soul Revolution. There is a confusion over the composition of \\"Small Axe\\", the Trojan-issued African Herbsman album crediting the song to Lee Perry, whereas the Island-issued Burnin album by The Wailers and U Roy's Virgin-issued DJ version both credit the song to Bob Marley. The 1971 Jamaican issue credits the song to both L.Perry and B.Marley. This discrepancy, which occurred on a lot of the Lee Perry material that was later re-recorded by Marley and the Wailers for Island Records was one of the major sources of the feud that raged between Lee Perry and Island for most of the last part of the 20th century.

For over fifty years she actively performed, taught and choreographed in classic Japanese dance forms and contemporary collaborative multimedia performance works. She appeared in Japan, the United States and Europe as a choreographer. She collaborated on many of famed director and designer Robert Wilson‚Äôs most revered works created during the years 1984 through 1999 http://levyarchive.bam.org/Detail/occurrences/1276 http://www.curtainup.com/daysbeforedeath.html https://www.operadeparis.fr/en/season-19-20/opera/madama- butterflyhttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Femme_%C3%A0_la_cafeti%C3%A8re. https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/24/arts/dance-view-robert-wilson-s-stunning- images-do-they-add-up.html Background and career Suzushi Hanayagi was born Mitsuko Kiuchi, in Osaka, Japan, in 1928. At the age of three she started her dance training with her aunt, Suzukinu Hanayagi, learning the Hanayagi style, a traditional Kabuki school of dance founded in Japan's nineteenth century Edo period https://japanese-wiki- corpus.github.io/person/Jusuke%20HANAYAGI,%20the%20first.html. At the age of twenty she became a Natori (dancer)|natori, receiving her Hanayagi name https://www.arts.gov/art-works/2015/beginners-guide-japanese-classical-dance, after mastering 100 dances. She subsequently began studying with Takehara Han https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/29/archives/2-worlds-of-dance-of-suzushi- hanayagi-classics-are-her-forte-a.html, a master dancer based in Tokyo who developed her singular classic salon style related to mai styles started in Osaka and Kyoto during the Edo period, and incorporating techniques related to Noh theater. Interested in these more abstract and poetic styles, Ms. Hanayagi later added studies with Yachiyo Inoue, headmaster of the Inoue https://performingarts.jp/E/art_interview/1709/1.html school, a Kyoto-based dance style used by geishas, with whom she continued to study until 2000, when she ceased actively performing. Ms. Hanayagi began studying modern dance techniques in Tokyo in the early 1950s, and presented her first modern choreography concert there in 1957, with music by John Cage and contemporary Japanese and European composers. After seeing exhibitions of works by such artists as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and hearing that artists like Robert Rauschenberg were dancing, she became interested in experiencing the new arts scene happening in New York City. At the beginning of the 1960s, Ms. Hanayagi arrived in the United States as a cultural exchange visitor under programs sponsored by the Martha Graham School and Japan Society. Also during the 1960s, she participated in the performance experiments happening at Anna Halprin‚Äôs workshops in the San Francisco Bay Area and in New York City with Fluxus and at the Judson Dance Theater. There, she began to collaborate with Carla Blankhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carla_Blank. Over seventeen years they created fourteen dance theater works, which they performed in New York City through 1966, and then in Japan and the San Francisco Bay Area. She remained a New York resident for most of the 1960s, where in 1962 she met and married visual artist Isamu Kawaihttps://books.google.com/books?id=wDkDAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PA75&lpg;=PA75&dq;=isamu+kawai+artist&source;=bl&ots;=DgUdZG42w3&sig;=ACfU3U1WGkVhQkYndkACK_SDfnI1lKsZSw&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiIl6bO_c3pAhUQ5awKHRm2CAwQ6AEwB3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q;=isamu%20kawai%20artist&f;=false, returning to Osaka in 1967 to be near her family for the birth of their son, Asenda Kiuchi. She re-established Osaka as her main residence again in 1969, to have her family's help raising him after their separation and divorce. Almost yearly, following her return to Japan, she presented classical dance performances in Osaka and Tokyo, frequently at Tokyo's National Theatre. These were either solo concerts or with her sister Suzusetsu Hanayagi https://www.dancemagazine.com/suzushi- hanayagi-1928aeur-2010-a-2306898174.htmland niece Suzusetsumi Hanayagi, as were her classic dance tours in the United States and Europe. In addition, nearly every year from the early 1980s through 1999, she continued to present solo performances of her original work, mainly at the now closed Jean Jean Theatre in Tokyo. These works also often involved collaborations with other artists, including videographer Katsuhiro Yamaguchi https://post.at.moma.org/content_items/83-interview-with-yamaguchi-katsuhiro, writers Heiner Muller and Ishmael Reed, composers Netty Simonshttps://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/18/arts/review-dance-experiment-with- mirrors-and-a-dancing-camera.html, David Byrne http://www.dissidentusa.com/robert-wilson/subjects/suzushi-hanayagi/suzushi- hanayagi-i/, Takehisa Kosugihttps://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/10/arts/review- dance-life-through-a-glass-darkly.html , and Hans Peter Kuhn http://www.emasound.org/emas/hans-peter-kuhn/, https://hanspeterkuhn.com/dance/americium-225-89/and visual artists Hirata and Yasuo Ihara https://artdaily.cc/news/101018/Ulterior-Gallery-opens-a-solo- exhibition-by-the-late-Japanese-artist-Yasuo- Ihara#.XrXr42hKi70https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56e4a5e1b09f956469fc080e/t/5be478af4fa51ab5ec5e93d0/1541699759316/CV_Ihara%2C+Yasuo_NW+edit.pdf. From 1984 and continuing throughout the 1990s, Ms. Hanayagi served as the choreographer for over fifteen seminal productions and projects by stage director and designer Robert Wilson http://www.robertwilson.com/suzushi- hanayagi. Their collaborations were mostly large-scale theater and opera productions presented internationally, beginning with the Knee Plays, premiered at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiygSfpJoW0 as part of Wilson's multi- sectioned work, The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down. Among other artistic collaborations that occurred throughout her career, Ms. Hanayagi appeared with performance artists Yoko Onohttps://archives.jacobspillow.org/index.php/Detail/entities/4261 and Ayo, and in works directed by filmmaker Molly Davies https://www.nefa.org/molly- davies, choreographer/filmmaker Elaine Summers https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/16/arts/dance-solitary-geography-mixed-media- ode-to-nature.html and director Julie Taymor https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/8233810https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2009/07/24/arts/last- homage-to-suzushi-hanayagi/#.XrXGUmhKi70, besides serving as coach and choreographer for classic dance performances by the popular Japanese actress Shiho Fujimura https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0297788/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm. In 2008, when her artist friends learned Suzushi Hanayagi was ill with Alzheimer's disease and residing in a special care facility in Osaka, Japan, they gathered together to create a multidisciplinary live performance portrait, KOOL-Dancing In My Mind, a poetic monument fueled by their wish to help guarantee her legacy as a great dancer and choreographer https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2009/07/24/arts/last-homage-to-suzushi- hanayagi/#.XrXGUmhKi70. Incorporating 6 live dancers in reconstructions of her choreographic collaborations from works with Blank and Wilson, besides archival photographs, videos of her in performance, excerpts from various published interviews and unpublished letters to Blank, and recent images of her head, hands and feet by Richard Rutkowski http://www.cool- ny.com/en/archives/1168, it was first shown at New York City's Guggenheim Museum in their 2009 Works & Process Series and developed further at Guild Hall https://www.art-it.asia/en/u/admin_news_e/la74yrdkhdz6tcni0hobin East Hampton, was given its international debut at Berlin's Academy of the Arts in September 2010, and was chosen by Wilson to represent his work at his 2010 Jerome Robbins Award ceremony at New York's Baryshnikov Art Center, December 9, 2010 https://www.theatermania.com/shows/new-york-city-theater/the-space-in- back-of-you_195404. Also in 2010, the Guggenheim performance became the basis of a 26-minute documentary film KOOL, Dancing in my Mind https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1634557/ directed by Richard Rutkowski and Wilson, premiered on ARTE TV in France and Sundance Channel in the U.S. Rutkowski's 65 minute film on Ms. Hanayagi, The Space in Back of You,http://www.cool-ny.com/en/archives/1168 http://archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN19408had its New York premiere at the Film Society of Lincoln Center's 2012 Dance on Camera event, its California premiere at the San Francisco Int'l Asian American film festival and international premiere at Thessaloniki Doc Film Festival in March, 2012. Dance styles and legacies In a 1986 interview by Japanese Dance magazine editor Roku Hasegawa, Suzushi Hanayagi said: \\"[My work] is like a diary. My work is to observe myself and to receive outside stimulation or experiences. I compose my thoughts from these sources. When I used to live in New York I felt a conflict in using separate ways, because the people that I worked with were in different worlds. After returning to Japan I started to study classic dance form again. This time I tried a different way to work. I like it very much. So I feel very natural when I‚Äôm doing it. It resolved the conflict. I can use two worlds of dance without mixing. I don‚Äôt know why I came to admire the conflict. It may be because I become dull or generous. Anyway, I become two worlds with one world. I don‚Äôt criticize this in myself.\\" In a 1986 interview while in residence at American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts https://americanrepertorytheater.org/shows-events/alcestis/, Hanayagi commented: ‚ÄúWhen I do classical dance, I don‚Äôt want to change the movement. I don‚Äôt want to put my own expression, my own ego, into the classical dance tradition. When I studied with my teacher one-on-one, I felt something very much like Zen meditation; I felt very pure, I didn‚Äôt feel anything about my own ego or expression.\\" Robert Wilson has said he discovered, from working with Hanayagi, that abstract movement can generate meaning and that movement can be a counterpoint to language. Hanayagi helped him open up the vocabulary of the gesture and opened Wilson's eyes to the importance of feet and the connection of the body to the ground, impacting the ways Wilson's actors stand and move through space, using their entire bodies to convey meaning. Without her influence, he would not have been able to master the literary texts and operatic pieces that have become such a focus of the latter part of his career. In an interview published in Japan in the book Odori Wa Jinsei (Dance Is A Life, 2003) https://www.dancemagazine.com/suzushi- hanayagi-1928aeur-2010-a-2306898174.html, Hanayagi was asked why she could work with mixed traditions again and again when working with Robert Wilson. And she answered, \\"All that I learned from the teachers has become my flesh and blood. And when I am asked to choreograph, it all comes out. When I worked on the choreography for Bob Wilson‚Äôs Le Martyre de Saint Sebastien, I felt so much responsibility I couldn‚Äôt sleep the night before -- I was thinking so hard about what I was doing. It‚Äôs not modern dance, it‚Äôs not ballet. It isn‚Äôt anything. It‚Äôs my original work. Yet it‚Äôs not mine. It is what was given to me by my teachers.\\" List of works Solo works, partial listing *1962: (performed at Hunter Playhouse, January 11, 1962) ** Song of the Soil, with music by Michio Mamiya ** Spirit of the Wood, with music by Pierre Henry and Pierre Schaeffer ** Without Color, with music by Toshiro Mayuzumi ** Ekagra, with music by Kazuo Fukushima ** Flying God, with music by Philippe Arthuyet ** Womb, with music by Karlheinz Stockhausen ** Action, with music by Mauricio Kagel *1963: (premieres performed at Fashion Institute of Technology, April 9, 1962) ** Tracer, with music Circle of Attitudes by Netty Simons ** Wood Grain, with music from Karuna by Kazuo Fukushima ** 9 Heads 1000 Eyes 990 Hands 6 Legs, with music by Teiji Ito *1964 (premieres performed in Tokyo, Japan) ** Echo White, with music by Morton Feldman **Double Joint, with music by Karlheinz Stockhausen **Steps Stop, with music by Earle Brown *1976: Clown *1978: Unkind Trotsky, with Down Town Boogie Woogie Band *1979: **Nonsense **Kore I *1980: Kore II *1981: Kore III *1982: Americium 231, with music composed by Netty Simons and Carlos Santana *1984: Americium 95 *1985: Americium 3958, with David Byrne music *1986: Americium 225 *1987: Americium '97 with Libgart Schwarz, 1001 Nacht *1989: Americium 225 '89, with composer/artist Hans Peter Kuhn *1990: Americium 1931, with composer/artist Hans Peter Kuhn *1996: Americium Die, with composer/artist Hans Peter Kuhn *1997: Americium/ E.M., with Conjure I, music to texts by Ishmael Reed *1998: Americium '98: Black Road to the Vanishing Point, with Conjure II, music to texts by Ishmael Reed'' *1999: Americium '99: Blue of Dance, Picasso blue & Yves Klein blue, based on concept by Ishmael Reed Collaborations with Carla Blank *1964: Rainbow #4, Fluxus event with Ay-O *1965: Spaced *1966: **Wall St. Journal **Sidelights *1971-73: Work *1972: With Son *1973: **Ghost Dance **Shadow Dance *1974: **Crowd, with film by Sekio Imura **The Lost State of Franklin, collaboration with Ishmael Reed *1976: Animuls *1977: Trickster Today *1979-1981: Kore at Eleusis Collaborations with Robert Wilson *1984: The Knee Plays, from the CIVIL warS, a collaboration also with composer David Byrne *1986: ** Alceste, based on Euripides‚Äô play, with prologue text by Heiner Muller and epilogue music by Laurie Anderson ** Hamletmachine, a collaboration based on Heiner Muller‚Äôs text *1987: ** Death, Destruction and Detroit II ** The Forest, also with composer David Byrne *1988: ** Le Martyre de Saint Sebastien ** Pelleas et Melisande * 1989: ** La Femme a la Cafetiere, a film with Ms. Hanayagi as featured performer ** De Materie ** Orlando * 1990: ** King Lear ** Alceste, Puccini‚Äôs opera *1992: Dr. Faustus Lights the Lights, from Gertrude Stein‚Äôs text *1993: Madame Butterfly, an opera by Puccini *1999: Death, Destruction and Detroit III: the days before *2009: Kool, Dancing in my Mind, also with Carla Blank and Richard Rutkowski Other multimedia collaborations with Suzushi Hanayagi as choreographer, partial listing *1983: Movements, the first collaboration with videographer Katsuhiro Yamaguchi *1988: Arrivals & Departures, a collaboration conceived and directed by Molly Davies, with music composed and performed by Takehisa Kosugi *1987: Bitwin, Dance in Media, collaboration with Katsuhiro Yamaguchi, including their video ‚ÄúMs. Hands and Feet‚Äù *1988: Oedipus Rex, directed by Julie Taymor with the Japan Philharmonic directed by Seiji Ozawa *1994: Sansho the Bailiff.

The film's script was adapted by writer Luther Reed from the 1910 Broadway play by George M. Cohan,https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/get-rich-quick-wallingford-7178 which in turn was adapted from the novel Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford by George Randolph Chester. Produced by Cosmopolitan Productions and distributed by Paramount Pictures Corporation, the film was released in seven reels on December 4, 1921. Plot 'Blackie' Daw arrives in the town of Battlesburg, Iowa. He has little money, but makes it known that J. Rufus Wallingford, a wealthy businessman, will be arriving in town soon and is interested in finding good investments. When Wallingford arrives, he and the townspeople hatch a scheme to build a factory, but they cannot decide what the factory should produce. Wallingford suggests carpet tacks, which he insists will interest other investors, and the townspeople agree. As time goes on, the company's stockholders begin to doubt Wallingford, who is, in fact, a con man. He is able to assuage their doubts. The establishment of the factory begins a real estate boom, and Wallingford and Daw are planning to skip town with the money they have made. But just before they do, a wealthy financier buys out Wallingford's interest and the factory makes a large sale of carpet tacks. As a result, Wallingford and Daw become wealthy by honest means. They both find women to marry, Wallingford to his stenographer Fannie Jasper and Daw to Dorothy Wells, daughter of a prominent town resident. Cast * Sam Hardy as J.

The first water supply company in the town was the Nottingham Waterworks Company, established in 1696, which took water from the River Leen, and later from springs at Scotholme, when the river became polluted. Other companies were set up in the late 18th century and in 1824, while in 1826 the Trent Water Company was established. They employed Thomas Hawksley as their engineer, who became one of the great water engineers of the period, and Nottingham had the first constant pressurised water supply system in the country. The various companies amalgamated in 1845, and Hawksley remained as the consulting engineer until 1879. Nottingham is located on top of a huge layer of Bunter sandstone, and Hawksley masterminded plans to extract filtered water from this aquifer. The Park Hill or Sion Hill pumping station was the first to be built in 1850, but was abandoned in 1880 as the water was too hard, and there were fears of pollution from the General Cemetery. Bagthorpe or Basford Works followed in 1857, and as the town expanded, further works were built to the north. Bestwood Pumping Station opened in 1871. The pumping stations were steam powered, and Hawksley also constructed a number of reservoirs to store the water, the final one under his jurisdiction being at Papplewick, completed just before water supply was taken over by the Corporation in 1880. Acquisition of the water company by the Corporation was first considered in 1852, but the water company resisted the proposals, and when Marriott Ogle Tarbotton was appointed as Borough Engineer in 1859, he had more serious issues to contend with, including sewage disposal and upgrading the infrastructure of a town which had expanded very rapidly in a short period. Takeover eventually happened in 1880, when the Nottingham Corporation Water Department was created, and Tarbotton commissioned the building of Papplewick Pumping Station, which was completed in 1884. Boughton Pumping Station, which was opened in 1905, was the last to use large-diameter wells, as other sites used boreholes. The first of these was at Burton Joyce, started at a similar time to Boughton, but completed in 1898. Nottingham became a city in 1897, and the water department was renamed as the City of Nottingham Water Department in 1912. The Corporation co-operated with Derby, Leicester, Sheffield and Derbyshire County, to create the Derwent Valley Water Board in 1899. Plans to construct reservoirs in the Derwent Valley in Derbyshire came to fruition in 1912 when Howden Reservoir was completed, although Nottingham did not use the water until 1917, due to quality issues. Ladybower Reservoir followed in 1945, and Derwent Reservoir in 1960. Five more borehole stations were built between 1945 and 1969, and steam engines were replaced by electric pumps in the 1960s. A new works and reservoir at Church Wilne on the Derwent was completed in 1967, but the planned reservoir at Carsington Water took until 1992 to complete. Meanwhile, water supply and sewerage ceased to be the responsibility of the City of Nottingham, and became part of the remit of the Severn Trent Water Authority in 1974. Following privatisation of the water industry in 1989, the responsibility passed to Severn Trent Water, one of ten water and sewage companies in England and Wales. Early History 1696‚Äì1880 (Old) Nottingham Waterworks Company Prior to 1696, water for the people of Nottingham was obtained from the river or from shallow wells, and carriers, known as Higglers, delivered it to those who wanted it. In 1696, the first Nottingham Waterworks Company obtained a lease from the Corporation, allowing it to build pumps and a water wheel to drive them, to extract water from the River Leen. The water was pumped to a reservoir to the east of Park Row, from where a network of pipes fed much of the town. The waterwheel and pumps were very similar to a system which the engineer George Sorocold had installed at London Bridge, and he may have been associated with the Nottingham scheme, but it is also possible that it was the Nottingham engineer Peter Whalley who designed it. In the eighteenth century Nottingham experienced rapid growth, as a result of the development of the frame knitting industry and the lace industry, with the population expanding five-fold from 10,000 in 1720 to 50,000 in 1830. The River Leen could no longer provide sufficient water to meet the need, and it also became polluted with sewage and industrial waste. Increasingly, there were complaints about the quality of the water. By 1830 the River Leen was sufficiently polluted that it was abandoned as a source of water, and instead, the company constructed a reservoir covering about in Scotholme, which was fed by spring water. They also constructed a new pumping station close to the Lean near Castle Rock. Water flowed by gravity from the new reservoir to the pumping station, through a iron pipe, from where it was pumped to a service reservoir close to the site of the General Hospital. Power could be provided either by a waterwheel or by a beam engine with a similar power output. The pumping station was located in Brewhouse Yard, and appeared on the first edition of the Ordnance Survey maps in 1880. Zion Hill Water and Marble Works A second private company, the Zion Hill Water and Marble Works was formed in the late 18th century. Zion Hill was in the Canning Circus area, and the company had two wells near Alfreton Road. The wells were deep, from which water was pumped by steam engines, which also powered some lace making machines and saws to cut marble. They supplied a fairly small area with good quality water, partly through pipes, and also by using water carriers to deliver the product. The company had ceased to function independently by 1824. Nottingham New Waterworks Company In order to supply water to the north-eastern part of the city, the Nottingham New Waterworks Company built the Northern Waterworks on North Sherwood Street. Operation commenced on 1 December 1824, with water pumped by a steam engine from a well into a cistern. Some of the water was piped to homes, and some was supplied to carriers. Trent Waterworks Company With demand for water outstripping the available sources, the Trent Waterworks Company was formed by Act of Parliament in May 1826, and in 1830 employed Thomas Hawksley to design and build a new waterworks at Trent Bridge. Hawksley had been born and educated in Nottingham, and at the age of 15 had started an apprenticeship with Edward Staveley, who ran an architectural practice and was Borough Surveyor. They were joined by Robert Jalland, and the three men later became partners. Hawksley was 23 when he was appointed engineer to the Trent Bridge works, which were completed in 1831. He constructed brick tunnels in the beds of sand and gravel on the north side of the River Trent, which filtered the water before it was collected in a rectangular reservoir. From there it was pumped by a single cylinder beam engine through an cast iron pipe to a service reservoir at Park Row. Hawksley wanted water to be available constantly, whereas most engineers of the time favoured an intermittent system, where the water was supplied infrequently, and used to fill cisterns. Thus Thomas Wicksteed and James Simpson, who were working for the London Water Companies, believed that such a system was unworkable, as taps and fittings would soon start to leak, resulting in it being impossible to supply the volume of water required to keep the system pressurised. Hawksley addressed this by designing fittings that were more robust, and which could be repaired easily if they did start to leak. The job of convincing plumbers to use them was difficult, but he persisted, and Nottingham had the first constant pressurised system in the country. This prevented contamination from entering the clean water mains. Much of the country was affected by outbreaks of cholera in 1832, at which point the Trent Waterworks Company was supplying water to some 15,000 people, out of a total population of around 53,000. 289 people died in Nottingham, but when there was a further nationwide outbreak in 1848, Nottingham was virtually unaffected. The Town's Sanitary Committee were convinced that a major factor was the availability of a clean, filtered water supply, although the mechanism by which water-borne diseases such as cholera were transmitted was not clearly understood at that time. Writing in 1935, J. Holland Walker reported > At the northern end of Trent Bridge, about on the site now occupied by the > Town Arms Hotel, stood the old water works of Nottingham, which were such a > charming feature of the landscape forty or fifty years ago, but which have > now completely disappeared.

J. Holland > Walker. 1935 Nottingham Waterworks Company Park Hill pumping station on The Ropewalk was built in 1850, but abandoned in 1880 due to water quality issues. Bestwood Pumping Station was the last to be built by the Nottingham Waterworks Company in 1871. Severn Trent Water occupy the site of Basford Waterworks. The reservoir was used for cooling the exhaust water from the three beam engines, one of which has been preserved. In 1845, the Nottingham Enclosure Act was obtained, which allowed the city to expand onto the surrounding land. The water companies had been in open competition for more than a decade, with no legal boundaries to define which areas each could supply, but to meet the challenges of the enlarging city, the Nottingham Water Act was also obtained in 1845, which formally merged the three companies into one, to be known as Nottingham Waterworks Company. Hawksley, as the most prominent engineer involved with any of the original enterprises, became consulting engineer for the new company, a position that he held until it was taken over by the Corporation in 1879. Nottingham sits on top of a huge area of Bunter sandstone, which holds large volumes of groundwater, which is prevented from seeping lower by an underlying layer of impermeable Permian marls. Bunter consists of loosely packed grains, which filter the water effectively, and does not contain soluble materials such as lime, resulting in the water being relatively soft. The new company looked to extract groundwater from the Bunter, and constructed the Park Hill or Sion Hill pumping station near The Ropewalk in 1850. A Cornish beam engine rated at pumped water from two wells, which were around deep and in diameter. Water was pumped onwards to Park Row Reservoir through an iron pipe in diameter, or to Belle Vue Reservoir through a diameter pipe. The works supplied between and of water per day, but was abandoned in 1880 due to the hardness of the water, and fears of contamination from the General Cemetery. The new Park Row Reservoir was constructed where Park Row joins The Ropewalk. The site for Belle Vue reservoir was obtained in 1846 by compulsory purchase using the powers that the Inclosure Commissioners had obtained in 1845. Ichabod Wright was reluctant to sell, because Toad Hole Hill was one of Nottingham's finest beauty spots. Hawksley's partner Robert Jalland designed the reservoir, which was long, wide and high, with the roof formed of 288 brick arches. The work was completed on 16 May 1851, and the reservoir could store of water. Subsequently, T C Hine designed a second reservoir, which was built by John Loverseed. It was by in size, held of water, and opened on 9 May 1864. Bagthorpe Works, which was also known as Basford Works, was completed in 1857 on a site near the junction of Haydn Road and Hucknall Road. There were two wells which were around deep, and each was pumped by a compound beam engine manufactured by R and W Hawthorn of Newcastle upon Tyne. The works was enlarged in 1868 when a third well was completed, pumped by an single cylinder engine. Mapperley Hill reservoir was constructed at a similar time, being completed in 1859. The next major expansion was the construction of Bestwood Pumping Station, some to the north of the city on the Mansfield Road. of land were leased from the Duke of St Albans in Bestwood Park, and two wells each deep were sunk into the Bunter sandstone. Two rotative beam engines were supplied by J. Witham and Sons of Leeds, and the water was pumped to a new reservoir at Redhill. Both the pumping station and the reservoir were completed in 1871. As a result of subsidence from coal mining, the pumping station is now about lower than when it was built, but the settlement has taken place gradually, and has not disrupted the operation of the works. Construction of a further reservoir at Papplewick was completed in 1880, just before the company was taken over by the Corporation, but it had to be abandoned in 1906 when it was damaged by subsidence. Nottingham Corporation Water Department The Nottingham Improvement Act of 1879 empowered Nottingham Corporation to take over the Nottingham Waterworks Company, but the plan had been nearly 30 years in the making. By the early 1850s around 12 local authorities had gained control of their own water supplies. In 1852, the council had asked the water company for a reduction in their rates, as they were a large user of water. Prior to the formation of the Nottingham Water Company in 1845, the old Nottingham Water Company had supplied water to the various parishes within its area of supply without charge, when the water was used for cleaning the streets. The new company had a more commercial outlook, stating that they were intent on making a profit from their enterprise. A public meeting, attended by between 600 and 800 people on 2 November 1853, instructed the council to prepare to take over water supply and gas supply. The gas company was estimated to be worth ¬£108,808, while the water company was estimated at ¬£60,100. Manchester was quoted as a town where such a takeover had significantly reduced the cost of water, and operating surpluses were being used to fund public works. In early 1854, the Waterworks Company presented a bill to Parliament to allow them to increase their capital. A motion for the council to buy the waterworks was defeated in a meeting on 6 February 1854, but they proposed to ask the company why they needed such a large increase in capital, to suggest that dividends on any such capital should be restricted to five per cent, that the provisions of the Waterworks Clauses Act 1847, which the sanitary reformer Edwin Chadwick had promoted to restrict profits that water companies could make, and to comply with all reasonable demands for water, should apply to the company, and that the council should be allowed to buy shares in the company, which would give them voting powers. The Water Company refused to consider any of these actions, and the issue of takeover lay dormant for a time. On 6 October 1859, Marriott Ogle Tarbotton became the Borough Engineer, having been chosen from 52 applicants despite only being 24. He faced rather more pressing problems, particularly the disposal of sewage, and issues with the infrastructure resulting from the overcrowding that had occurred before the Enclosure Act of 1845 had allowed the town to expand its borders. He was pre-occupied with these during the 1860s, although the issue of buying the Waterworks Company was pursued in 1869 and 1870, but the company refused to co-operate. The Water Company applied for Acts of Parliament in 1874, 1878 and 1879, with the Council opposing all of them. The Council in turn had obtained improvement acts in 1872 and 1874 which raised issues to do with water supply, and a similar act in 1879 which gave them powers to take the Waterworks Company over. This was completed on 25 March 1880 with the formation of the Nottingham Corporation Water Department, during a period when the town experienced rapid growth. As a result of a Borough Extension Act obtained in 1877, the population had increased from 86,621 in 1871 to 186,575 in 1881, while its area had increased from to during the same period. On 25 May 1880 the Water Department invited the members of the Corporation to inspect the works of the important water undertaking recently acquired by the town. The tour began at the public offices in Albert Street from where the large party rode to Trent Bridge in private trams supplied by the Nottingham and District Tramways Company Limited. They travelled by tram again and then walked to the Castle Works. From there they proceeded to the Park Row reservoir, and then walked to the Sion Hill (Canning Circus) Works. From the top of the Derby Road, the tram cars were used for the journey to Scotholme Springs. The party then moved on in eight carriages to see Bagthorpe pumping station, Redhill reservoir, Papplewick reservoir and finally Bestwood Pumping Station, where they took a late lunch in a marquee in its grounds. A newspaper report the following day noted how well the late Water Company had managed its assets. Wilford Suspension Bridge Tarbotton ceased to be Borough Engineer, and became engineer for the gas works, which had been taken over in 1874, and of the water works. He set about improving the available supplies of water, constructing two wells at Papplewick, some to the north of Nottingham. The designs for the pumping station may well have been borrowed from Hawksley, who had previously negotiated with the landowner for rights to extract water, and James Watt and Co, who supplied the two large beam engines for Papplewick, noted the similarity between the design and that of a pumping station at Great Yarmouth, also designed by Hawksley. The first engine was run in September 1884, although the works were not declared to be complete until 12 April 1886. The two wells were deep, and were connected by adits which were long. Water was raised by ram pumps connected to the rotative beam engines. An additional reservoir was constructed at Mapperley, as well as a water main to link the two sites. When Papplewick Pumping Station came on line, the Scotholme, Trent Bridge, and Brewhouse Yard works were abandoned, having been out of use since 1871, when the Bestwood pumping station had started to produce water. Tarbotton, who had overseen its construction, died unexpectedly on 6 March 1887, though his colleagues stated that he had worked too hard, without adequate rest and recreation, and had shown signs of stress during his final two years. A report on 1898 identified the need for another pumping station, and a site at Boughton, north of the town centre was chosen. Three wells were built to a depth of around , which were connected together by adits. Boreholes were then drilled from the adits to a depth of , and water was raised by ram pumps powered by triple expansion steam engines. The station was the last to use wells, and when it was completed in 1905, it could produce per day. Subsequent stations used boreholes, and the first of these was completed at Burton Joyce in 1898. Three more boreholes were drilled at the site in 1908, to a depth of . In 1906, Wilford Suspension Bridge was built across the Trent to carry water mains and gas mains. The water fed a new reservoir at Wilford Hill in West Bridgford, which enabled the Park Row reservoir site to be sold to the General Hospital. The five pumping stations now owned by the corporation drew water from the bunter sandstone and delivered it to covered reservoirs in the city, from where it was delivered by gravity to domestic and industrial consumers. City of Nottingham Water Department Ompton Pumping Station is a borehole site, opened in 1969. Nottingham was granted city status in 1897 by Queen Victoria as part of her jubilee celebrations, and the Nottingham Corporation Waterworks was renamed the City of Nottingham Water Department in 1912. In 1899, Nottingham co-operated with Derby, Leicester, Sheffield and Derbyshire County, to create the Derwent Valley Water Board, which was authorised by the Derwent Valley Water Act of 1899. This allowed them to construct reservoirs in the Derwent Valley in Derbyshire. Howden Reservoir was the first to be completed, in 1912, and water from it was filtered, before being piped to the cities. Although water from this source became available in 1913, there were complaints, and it was not used until a filter works was constructed at Eastwood. The city began drawing water from the Derwent scheme in 1917, and this provided one quarter of Nottingham's water by 1918. Ladybower Reservoir was completed in 1945, and Derwent Reservoir was commissioned in 1960. The Nottingham Corporation Act 1938 authorised the construction of two new pumping station, three new reservoirs, a water tower and trunk mains.Nottingham. Official Guide. Tenth Edition The whole of the works was estimated to cost ¬£400,000 and was scheduled for completion by 1948, but the project was interrupted by World War II. Between 1945 and 1969, with revised plans five further electrically-powered borehole stations were built at Rufford, completed in 1945, Lambley, built in 1957, Halam, operational by 1963, Markham Clinton, opened in 1965, and finally Ompton, which was finished in 1969. By 1969, of water were supplied daily from boreholes and pumping stations abstracting water from the Bunter sandstone. The steam engine at Burton Joyce borehole was replaced by an electric pump in 1928, but despite large increases in the costs of coal and labour, the other steam engines were retained until the 1960s, when there was a programme to fit electric pumps. The third engine at Basford was replaced by a submersible pump at the bottom of the well in 1961, and the other two engines were replaced in 1963. One of these engines was subsequently preserved at Wollaton Park Industrial Museum, maintained by the Arkwright Society. Electrification of Bestwood followed in 1966, Boughton in 1967 and finally Papplewick in 1969. Before the conversion was completed, the Minister of Public Buildings and Works notified the Water Department that he intended to use the powers of the Ancient Monuments Act 1931 to schedule Papplewick pumping station as an industrial monument, and this occurred in April 1969. A Trust was established to take over the works, and were given a 99-year lease of the site just before responsibility for water supply passed to a Regional water authority in 1974. In 1967 a new reservoir and treatment works was built at Church Wilne, extracting up to per day from the River Derwent. In order to sustain such abstraction, a second reservoir was built at Carsington, into which water is pumped from the river during the winter months, while water is released into the river in the summer months, allowing it to be abstracted again at Church Wilne. Planning for Carsington Water began in the 1960s, although construction of the retaining dam did not start until 1979. In 1984, before filling of the reservoir began, there was a major structural failure of the dam, which had to be removed and rebuilt, delaying completion until 1992, when Queen Elizabeth formally opened it. Sewerage When Tarbotton became Borough Engineer, the lower parts of the town were often affected by flooding of polluted water from the River Leen. This was a consequence of six parishes adjacent to the town discharging raw sewage into the river. In 1872 the Nottingham and District Sewerage Act was obtained, and enabled the Nottingham and Leen District Sewerage Board to be created. In addition to his other duties, Tarbotton became the Sewerage Board's engineer in 1872, and set about rectifying the situation. He oversaw the construction of sewers and sewage pumping stations, which carried the effluent to a sewage farm some downstream of Nottingham at Stoke Bardolph. Here it was treated, and the liquor discharged into the River Trent was relatively pure. The Borough Extension Act of 1877 incorporated the offending parishes into the town of Nottingham, and the responsibilities of the Sewerage Board were taken over by the Corporation at the same time. Initially the Corporation leased of agricultural land from Earl Manvers. A deed from 1878 states that John Elliot Burnside leased the farm to the Mayor, Alderman and Burgesses of the Borough of Nottingham for a period of 60 years, at an annual rent of ¬£135, but the estate at Stoke Bardolph was subsequently purchased. The location was selected because it had good drainage, allowing the sewage to be spread over the land, where it seeped into the soil. Tarbotton was responsible for the construction of the sewage farm, and the first stage became operational on 17 June 1880. However, he did not see it completed, as he suffered a stroke while attending a meeting of the Sewage Farm Committee on 4 March 1887, and died two days later. Additional land adjacent to the original site was acquired, some of which was in the neighbouring parish of Bulcote. The farm produced milk from cattle kept on the land, and was also a centre for pedigree shire horses and pigs. In 1936, the Corporation embarked on a scheme to upgrade the main drainage and sewage disposal works. New sewers were constructed, and an additional pumping station was commissioned at Sneinton, to the east of the city centre. Work at Stoke Bardplph included new buildings providing preliminary treatment of the sewage before the effluent was spread over the land. Aeration units were added in 1960, allowing rotation of the land receiving digested sludge. The works is partially self-sufficient, using electricity generated from biogas produced from the sewage to power the plant. Historical records from the sewage farm dating for the years 1892 to 1975 were deposited in the Nottingham University Library in 1981. They comprise 114 large volumes, covering all aspects of the operation from shortly after it became operational until it was taken over in 1973 by the Severn Trent Water Authority. Privatisation The City of Nottingham Water Department existed until 1974 when, under the terms of the Water Act 1973, responsibility for water supply, sewerage and sewage treatment were transferred to the Severn Trent Water Authority, one of ten Regional Water Authorities established to manage water resources in England and Wales, which included land drainage and river quality. There were issues with the new structures, as a single authority responsible for river quality and sewage treatment was unlikely to prosecute itself for breaches in quality. It also became obvious that the water and sewage industry suffered from ageing infrastructure and chronic under-investment. The Conservative Party of the time saw privatisation as a means to solve the funding gap, and under the terms of the Water Act 1989, the Water Authority became Severn Trent Water, a water and sewerage company, with the river quality and land drainage functions passing to the National Rivers Authority, and subsequently the Environment Agency.

This detritus or dead organic material and its constituent nutrients are added to the top layer of soil, commonly known as the litter layer or O horizon (\\"O\\" for \\"organic\\"). Litter is an important factor in ecosystem dynamics, as it is indicative of ecological productivity and may be useful in predicting regional nutrient cycling and soil fertility.  Characteristics and variability  Plant litter, mainly western hemlock, Tsuga heterophylla, in Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Washington, United States Litterfall is characterized as fresh, undecomposed, and easily recognizable (by species and type) plant debris. This can be anything from leaves, cones, needles, twigs, bark, seeds/nuts, logs, or reproductive organs (e.g. the stamen of flowering plants). Items larger than 2 cm diameter are referred to as coarse litter, while anything smaller is referred to as fine litter or litter. The type of litterfall is most directly affected by ecosystem type. For example, leaf tissues account for about 70 percent of litterfall in forests, but woody litter tends to increase with forest age. In grasslands, there is very little aboveground perennial tissue so the annual litterfall is very low and quite nearly equal to the net primary production.Schlesinger, William H. Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change. 2nd Edition. Academic Press. 108, 135, 152‚Äì158, 180‚Äì183, 191‚Äì194. (1997). In soil science, soil litter is classified in three layers, which form on the surface of the O Horizon. These are the L, F, and H layers: The litter layer is quite variable in its thickness, decomposition rate and nutrient content and is affected in part by seasonality, plant species, climate, soil fertility, elevation, and latitude. The most extreme variability of litterfall is seen as a function of seasonality; each individual species of plant has seasonal losses of certain parts of its body, which can be determined by the collection and classification of plant litterfall throughout the year, and in turn affects the thickness of the litter layer. In tropical environments, the largest amount of debris falls in the latter part of dry seasons and early during wet season. As a result of this variability due to seasons, the decomposition rate for any given area will also be variable. Litter fall in the North American Baldcypress Swamp Network, Illinois to Louisiana, 2003 Latitude also has a strong effect on litterfall rates and thickness. Specifically, litterfall declines with increasing latitude. In tropical rainforests, there is a thin litter layer due to the rapid decomposition, while in boreal forests, the rate of decomposition is slower and leads to the accumulation of a thick litter layer, also known as a mor. Net primary production works inversely to this trend, suggesting that the accumulation of organic matter is mainly a result of decomposition rate. Surface detritus facilitates the capture and infiltration of rainwater into lower soil layers. Soil litter protects soil aggregates from raindrop impact, preventing the release of clay and silt particles from plugging soil pores. Releasing clay and silt particles reduces the capacity for soil to absorb water and increases cross surface flow, accelerating soil erosion. In addition soil litter reduces wind erosion by preventing soil from losing moisture and providing cover preventing soil transportation. Organic matter accumulation also helps protect soils from wildfire damage. Soil litter can be completely removed depending on intensity and severity of wildfires and season. Regions with high frequency wildfires have reduced vegetation density and reduced soil litter accumulation. Climate also influences the depth of plant litter. Typically humid tropical and sub- tropical climates have reduced organic matter layers and horizons due to year- round decomposition and high vegetation density and growth. In temperate and cold climates, litter tends to accumulate and decompose slower due to a shorter growing season. Net primary productivity Net primary production and litterfall are intimately connected. In every terrestrial ecosystem, the largest fraction of all net primary production is lost to herbivores and litterfall. Due to their interconnectedness, global patterns of litterfall are similar to global patterns of net primary productivity. Habitat and food Litter provides habitat for a variety of organisms. Plants Common wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella) in Ivanovo Oblast, Russia Certain plants are specially adapted for germinating and thriving in the litter layers. For example, bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) shoots puncture the layer to emerge in spring. Some plants with rhizomes, such as common wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella) do well in this habitat. Detritivores and other decomposers Fungi in the forest floor (Marselisborg Forests in Denmark) A skink, Eutropis multifasciata, in leaf litter in Sabah, Malaysia Many organisms that live on the forest floor are decomposers, such as fungi. Organisms whose diet consists of plant detritus, such as earthworms, are termed detritivores. The community of decomposers in the litter layer also includes bacteria, amoeba, nematodes, rotifer, tardigrades, springtails, cryptostigmata, potworms, insect larvae, mollusks, oribatid mites, woodlice, and millipedes. Even some species of microcrustaceans, especially copepods (for instance Bryocyclops spp., Graeteriella spp.,Olmeccyclops hondo, Moraria spp.,Bryocamptus spp.,Atheyella spp.) live in moist leaf litter habitats and play an important role as predators and decomposers. The consumption of the litterfall by decomposers results in the breakdown of simple carbon compounds into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), and releases inorganic ions (like nitrogen and phosphorus) into the soil where the surrounding plants can then reabsorb the nutrients that were shed as litterfall. In this way, litterfall becomes an important part of the nutrient cycle that sustains forest environments. As litter decomposes, nutrients are released into the environment. The portion of the litter that is not readily decomposable is known as humus. Litter aids in soil moisture retention by cooling the ground surface and holding moisture in decaying organic matter. The flora and fauna working to decompose soil litter also aid in soil respiration. A litter layer of decomposing biomass provides a continuous energy source for macro- and micro-organisms. Larger animals Numerous reptiles, amphibians, birds, and even some mammals rely on litter for shelter and forage. Amphibians such as salamanders and caecilians inhabit the damp microclimate underneath fallen leaves for part or all of their life cycle. This makes them difficult to observe. A BBC film crew captured footage of a female caecilian with young for the first time in a documentary that aired in 2008. Some species of birds, such as the ovenbird of eastern North America for example, require leaf litter for both foraging and material for nests. Sometimes litterfall even provides energy to much larger mammals, such as in boreal forests where lichen litterfall is one of the main constituents of wintering deer and elk diets.  Nutrient cycle  During leaf senescence, a portion of the plant's nutrients are reabsorbed from the leaves. The nutrient concentrations in litterfall differ from the nutrient concentrations in the mature foliage by the reabsorption of constituents during leaf senescence. Plants that grow in areas with low nutrient availability tend to produce litter with low nutrient concentrations, as a larger proportion of the available nutrients is reabsorbed. After senescence, the nutrient-enriched leaves become litterfall and settle on the soil below. A budget for organic matter in a mature (120-year-old) Scots pine monoculture (SWECON site). Based on data from Andersson et al.(1980). Units are in kg of organic matter per ha. Att. -attached; Surf. -surface; min. -mineral; and veg. -vegetationBreymeyer, A.I., B. Berg, S.T. Gower, & D. Johnson. ‚ÄúTemperate Coniferous Forests‚Äù Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE). Vol. 56: Global Change: Effects on Coniferous Forests and Grasslands Carbon Budget, Ch. 3. (1996). Litterfall is the dominant pathway for nutrient return to the soil, especially for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The accumulation of these nutrients in the top layer of soil is known as soil immobilization. Once the litterfall has settled, decomposition of the litter layer, accomplished through the leaching of nutrients by rainfall and throughfall and by the efforts of detritivores, releases the breakdown products into the soil below and therefore contributes to the cation exchange capacity of the soil. This holds especially true for highly weathered tropical soils. Leaching is the process by which cations such as iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al), as well as organic matter are removed from the litterfall and transported downward into the soil below. This process is known as podzolization and is particularly intense in boreal and cool temperate forests that are mainly constituted by coniferous pines whose litterfall is rich in phenolic compounds and fulvic acid. By the process of biological decomposition by microfauna, bacteria, and fungi, CO2 and H2O, nutrient elements, and a decomposition-resistant organic substance called humus are released. Humus composes the bulk of organic matter in the lower soil profile. The decline of nutrient ratios is also a function of decomposition of litterfall (i.e. as litterfall decomposes, more nutrients enter the soil below and the litter will have a lower nutrient ratio). Litterfall containing high nutrient concentrations will decompose more rapidly and asymptote as those nutrients decrease. Knowing this, ecologists have been able to use nutrient concentrations as measured by remote sensing as an index of a potential rate of decomposition for any given area.Melillo, J.M., & J.R. Gosz. ‚ÄúInteractions of Biogeochemical Cycles in Forest Ecosystems‚Äù Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE). Vol. 21: The Major Biogeochemical Cycles and Their Interactions, Ch. 6. (1983). Globally, data from various forest ecosystems shows an inverse relationship in the decline in nutrient ratios to the apparent nutrition availability of the forest. Once nutrients have re- entered the soil, the plants can then reabsorb them through their roots. Therefore, nutrient reabsorption during senescence presents an opportunity for a plant's future net primary production use. A relationship between nutrient stores can also be defined as: :annual storage of nutrients in plant tissues + replacement of losses from litterfall and leaching = the amount of uptake in an ecosystem Collection and analysis The main objectives of litterfall sampling and analysis are to quantify litterfall production and chemical composition over time in order to assess the variation in litterfall quantities, and hence its role in nutrient cycling across an environmental gradient of climate (moisture and temperature) and soil conditions.Simmons, Jeffrey A. ‚ÄúMeasuring Litterfall Flux.‚Äù West Virginia Wesleyan College (2003). Ecologists employ a simple approach to the collection of litterfall, most of which centers around one piece of equipment, known as a litterbag. A litterbag is simply any type of container that can be set out in any given area for a specified amount of time to collect the plant litter that falls from the canopy above. Litterfall and throughfall collectors at beech stand in Thetford, East Anglia Litterbags are generally set in random locations within a given area and marked with GPS or local coordinates, and then monitored on a specific time interval. Once the samples have been collected, they are usually classified on type, size and species (if possible) and recorded on a spreadsheet.Estrella, Stephanie. ‚ÄúStandard Operating Procedures for Litterfall Collection, Processing, and Analysis: Version 2.0.‚Äù Washington State Department of Ecology. (2008). When measuring bulk litterfall for an area, ecologists will weigh the dry contents of the litterbag. By this method litterfall flux can be defined as: :litterfall (kg m‚àí2 yr‚àí1) = total litter mass (kg) / litterbag area (m2)Bastrup-Birk, A., & Nathalie Br√©da. ‚ÄúReport on Sampling and Analysis of Litterfall‚Äù United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution: International Co- operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests. (2004). The litterbag may also be used to study decomposition of the litter layer. By confining fresh litter in the mesh bags and placing them on the ground, an ecologist can monitor and collect the decay measurements of that litter. An exponential decay pattern has been produced by this type of experiment: \\\\frac{X}{X_o} = e^{-k}, where X_o is the initial leaf litter and k is a constant fraction of detrital mass. The mass-balance approach is also utilized in these experiments and suggests that the decomposition for a given amount of time should equal the input of litterfall for that same amount of time. :litterfall = k(detrital mass) For study various groups from edaphic fauna you need a different mesh sizes in the litterbags Issues Change due to invasive earthworms In some regions of glaciated North America, earthworms have been introduced where they are not native. Non-native earthworms have led to environmental changes by accelerating the rate of decomposition of litter. These changes are being studied, but may have negative impacts on some inhabitants such as salamanders.  Forest litter raking  Leaf litter accumulation depends on factors like wind, decomposition rate and species composition of the forest. The quantity, depth and humidity of leaf litter varies in different habitats. The leaf litter found in primary forests is more abundant, deeper and holds more humidity than in secondary forests. This condition also allows for a more stable leaf litter quantity throughout the year . This thin, delicate layer of organic material can be easily affected by humans. For instance, forest litter raking as a replacement for straw in husbandry is an old non-timber practice in forest management that has been widespread in Europe since the seventeenth century. In 1853, an estimated 50 Tg of dry litter per year was raked in European forests, when the practice reached its peak. This human disturbance, if not combined with other degradation factors, could promote podzolisation; if managed properly (for example, by burying litter removed after its use in animal husbandry), even the repeated removal of forest biomass may not have negative effects on pedogenesis.

It is named for Venerius the Hermit, the patron saint of lighthouse keepers.  History  San Venerio Lighthouse is a fortified neoclassical building, despite having undergone many changes over time. Construction of the lighthouse was granted by King Charles Albert of Savoy and was initially fueled by vegetable oil, followed later by coal. In 1884 another tower was built, taller than the original at high, and at the top of the lenses an optical filament was added, electrically powered by two steam engines. This system gave too much power to the beam of light, and in 1912 the fuel was replaced with petroleum. The lighthouse was later electrified, and became fully automated in 1985.

It consists of three acoustic versions of \\"Poker Face\\", \\"Just Dance\\", and \\"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\\". The EP was released on February 3, 2009 initially released only through Borders stores and via digital download, and was later reissued on CD in August 2010. The Cherrytree Sessions received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Gaga's vocal abilities and the instrumentation of the three tracks, including their unusual incorporation of styles such as cabaret and beatboxing. It reached number 32 on the Mexican Albums Chart. Background and composition The Cherrytree Sessions is a series of EPs first envisaged by Cherrytree Records label head and producer Martin Kierszenbaum in order to promote his artists. With the assistance of Tony Ugval, Kierszenbaum was able to secure footage and music recordings of several performances from artists on the label's roster. Following requests from fans of the label's music, Kierszenbaum decided to release them commercially, and stated that \\"before long, we found ourselves with an extraordinary collection of recordings: intimate at times, unexpected at others.\\" Gaga's performances for The Cherrytree Sessions was first released as a video posted to the label's website. It begins with Gaga and producer Space Cowboy surprising Kierszenbaum in his office, known as The Cherrytree House. After discussing her international travels, Gaga performed an acoustic version of \\"Brown Eyes\\" at the piano where she had sung for Kierszenbaum the first time they met. She and Space Cowboy then performed a stripped-down version of \\"Just Dance\\" on their keyboards, before Gaga returned to the piano for an acoustic version of \\"Poker Face\\". The performance coincided with Gaga reaching number one on the Billboard Hot Digital Songs chart with \\"Just Dance\\" in 2008, and was available for streaming as a webisode on the Cherrytree Records website. The EP itself consists of three tracks recorded live from the event, all of which had previously been successful singles released from Gaga's first studio album, The Fame (2008). AllMusic compared the \\"solo piano rendition\\" of \\"Poker Face\\" to the style of cabaret, while \\"Just Dance\\" had only synths as its instrumentation. The final song, \\"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\\" makes use of keyboards and beatboxing, which is performed by Space Cowboy. Critical reception The Cherrytree Sessions was released on February 3, 2009, in the United States and was an import in European nations, including France. Mark Beech of Bloomberg L.P. gave The Cherrytree Sessions a positive review, awarding it three out of four stars. He praised Gaga's singing abilities and noting that the EP \\"shows Lady Gaga isn't all combustible miniskirts and flame-throwing bras.\\" Simon Gage of the Daily Express gave the album three out of five stars, expressing surprise at Gaga's singing abilities. \\"Often hidden under those dastardly catchy Eurobeats,\\" he noted, \\"on these earlier, simpler versions of tracks such as Poker Face and Just Dance, her voice gets a bit more of a chance to shine, as do the songs.\\" This sentiment was echoed by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, awarding three stars out of five, who felt that the performances were \\"effective showcases for Gaga‚Äôs charisma and songwriting.\\" Erlewine praised the music of \\"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\\" in particular, noting that its \\"bare-bones mix\\" was complementary to the release's aesthetic. The Cherrytree Sessions debuted at 45 on the Mexican Albums Chart on August 20, 2010, and moved to 32 the next week.

They play in Muskegon, Michigan, at Mercy Health Arena. The Lumberjacks replaced the International Hockey League franchise (IHL) of the same name, which relocated to Evansville, Indiana, at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 IHL season. History Lou and Josh Mervis, under a company named Blue Ox Hockey, originally owned the Danville Wings when they promoted that team from the Tier II North American Hockey League to the Tier I United States Hockey League. However, after one season, the Mervis family sold the franchise and it was relocated to become the Indiana Ice in 2004. The Mervis family had purchased the dormant Rochester Mustangs franchise to use as a new USHL team on the University of Illinois campus in Champaign, Illinois, but Josh Mervis agreed to be the general manager of the Ice for the first season in Indiana. After less than one season as general manager of the Ice, Josh Mervis left the team in order to focus on starting the Champaign team. However, the new proposed arena project never took off and the family began to look elsewhere such as La Crosse, Wisconsin, Battle Creek, Michigan, and Louisville, Kentucky. In February 2010, the USHL approved the Mervis family's plan to reactivate their dormant franchise in of Muskegon for the 2010‚Äì11 season. At the time, there was a low-level minor professional hockey team playing in the International Hockey League named the Muskegon Lumberjacks. The Mervis family then acquired the Lumberjacks name and folded the professional team with the new USHL team taking on the Lumberjacks identity that had been used on and off since 1984. The Mervis family retained the former owners of the Lumberjacks, Stacey Patulskey, Jeff Patulskey and Tim Taylor, as the managerial team. The Lumberjacks had a fairly successful inaugural season. On November 9, 2010, forward Matt Berry registered the first hat trick in team history in a 5‚Äì3 win over the Chicago Steel. The Lumberjacks clinched a Clark Cup Playoff berth with a victory over the Steel at the L. C. Walker Arena on April 8. Lumberjacks forwards Ryan Misiak and Matt Berry and defenseman Alexx Privitera were named to the CCM Eastern Conference All-Star team. Misiak led the Jacks in both points and assists with 58 and 43, respectively. Berry led the club with 25 goals.http://www.pointstreak.com/prostats/scoreboard.html?leagueid=49&seasonid;=5967 In the playoffs, the fifth-seeded Lumberjacks swept Team USA in the first round best-of-three series, then lost a best-of-five series 1‚Äì3 to the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders.http://www.pointstreak.com/prostats/scoreboard.html?leagueid=49http://www.mlive.com/lumberjacks/index.ssf/2011/04/muskegon_lumberjacks_playoff_r.html In the 2011‚Äì12 season, Muskegon rebounded from an 0‚Äì3‚Äì0 start by winning six out of seven games from October 30 through November 18. The run put the Lumberjacks at 7‚Äì6‚Äì0 but a pair of losses to eventual Anderson Cup champion Green Bay Gamblers started a 2‚Äì9‚Äì2 slump, which led to the dismissal of head coach and general manager Kevin Patrick on January 13. Patrick was replaced by 15-year NHL veteran and 2003 Stanley Cup winner Jim McKenzie. The team would finish last in the Eastern Conference with a 17-35-8 record and miss the playoffs. In late January 2012, the Lumberjacks hosted the inaugural USHL/NHL Top Prospects Game at L.C. Walker Arena, featuring the league's best talent eligible for the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. Muskegon was represented by Matt DeBlouw, Mark Yanis and Czech winger Adam Chlapik. Team East beat Team West 5‚Äì3 in a game that set a record for event viewership on FastHockey.com; it was called by Lumberjacks' broadcaster Matt Gajtka and Youngstown Phantoms' play- by-play announcer Bart Logan. The 2012 offseason began on a positive note as five players with Lumberjacks ties were taken in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. Michigan State recruit Matt DeBlouw was the Lumberjacks' only active player to be drafted; he went to the Calgary Flames in the seventh round. Two Lumberjacks from the team's inaugural USHL season (Brendan Woods - Carolina, Jaycob Megna - Anaheim) and two of Muskegon's future prospects (Adam Gilmour - Minnesota, Doyle Somerby - New York Islanders) were also drafted. In June 2013, the Mervis family sold the franchise to three former NHL players; brothers Chris and Peter Ferraro and John Vanbiesbrouck. In 2014‚Äì15, the Lumberjacks finished the regular season in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, earning Muskegon a berth in the Clark Cup playoffs. In the first round of the playoffs, Muskegon faced the regular season champion Youngstown Phantoms. Muskegon won game one of the five-game series by a final of 5‚Äì4 after Matheson Iacopelli's overtime goal. The Lumberjacks would fall in game two 4‚Äì2, leveling the series at one game apiece. In game three, each team managed only one goal through regulation and overtime. Muskegon goaltender Eric Schierhorn, the Lumberjacks' career wins leader, stopped 44 shots in over 90 minutes and Will Graber scored the double-overtime winner for the 2‚Äì1 win and series lead. The Lumberjacks won game four and the series. In the Eastern Conference finals, the Lumberjacks faced the Dubuque Fighting Saints, who finished the regular season in third place in the East. The two teams alternated wins in the first four games, setting up a decisive game five at Dubuque. Max Humitz and the Lumberjacks took a 4‚Äì1 lead after two periods before giving up two goals to the Fighting Saints in the third to make the score 4‚Äì3 with 6:16 to play. However, Schierhorn and the Lumberacks held off Dubuque's comeback and advanced to the Clark Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history. The Lumberjacks were then swept in the finals by the Sioux Falls Stampede. In August 2015, Dan Israel, a businessman from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, purchased the team. In the 2015‚Äì16 season, the team was able to tie with the Chicago Steel with 61 points each, landing them in seventh in the Eastern Conference and twelfth overall, but was not good enough to qualify for the playoffs. However, center Rem Pitlick was a bright spot for the team leading the league with 89 points (46 Goals and 43 Assists) in 56 games - a 1.59 points per game average. Pitlick was also the first Lumberjack to win an award as the USHL's 2015‚Äì16 Player of the Year and Forward of the Year, and being only the 22nd player to accept both. He was also named CCM Forward of the year, USA Dave Tyler Junior Player of the Year, made the All-USHL first team, named to World Junior A Challenge U.S. Select Team.http://www.ushl.com/view/#/player?playerId=461&season;=48 He was drafted in the third round of the 2016 NHL Entry Draft by the Nashville Predators. Following the 2015‚Äì16 season, head coach Todd Krygier was fired. On July 13, 2016, the Lumberjacks announced the hire of John LaFontaine The older brother of Hockey Hall of Famer Pat LaFontaine, John was named the North American Hockey League Coach of the Year in 2015‚Äì16, leading the Wichita Falls Wildcats to the Robertson Cup Finals. In 2016‚Äì17, the Lumberjacks used their tender to bring Andrei Svechnikov to Muskegon. Svechnikov, along with defenseman Bo Hanson, forward Collin Adams, and goaltenders Keith Petruzzelli and Adam Brizgala, helped the Lumberjacks to the best regular season in their history. Muskegon set team records in wins (37), points (79), goals scored (192) and goals allowed (157). Svechnikov would be named USHL Rookie of the Year after scoring 29 goals and 58 points in 48 games. Petruzzelli would set single- season records for goals against average (2.40), and go on to be drafted by the Detroit Red Wings in the third round of the 2017 NHL draft. Muskegon earned the third seed in the Eastern Conference, but fell to Dubuque in four games. In the playoff series, the Lumberjacks were without Svechnikov and Jachym Kondelik, who were representing their countries internationally. Mikael Hakkarainen and Casey Gilling also missed game four due to injury. After two seasons as head coach, and the first to lead the Lumberjacks to back-to-back playoff appearances, the Lumberjacks parted with LaFontaine on April 23, 2018, after being eliminated in the first round of the 2018 Clark Cup playoffs. LaFontaine was replaced by assistant coach Mike Hamilton. General manager and part owner John Vanbiesbrouck was also hired by USA Hockey as the assistant executive director of hockey operations and would be involved with selecting players for the US national teams. The Lumberjacks then hired the Chicago Steel's general manager Ryan Bennett for the same position.

Founded in 1932, it was the oldest of Habonim Dror North America's summer camps. Camp Na'aleh had its final summer in 2016. History Na'aleh was established as Camp Kvutza by the Young Poale Zion Alliance (YPZA) in 1932. That August, 14 YPZA members lived together in a tent in Highland Mills, New York. With the help of Golda Meyerson (who later changed her name to Golda Meir), Camp Kvutza secured a permanent location in Accord, New York, the following summer. The Young Poale Zion Alliance established Habonim as its children's movement in 1935. After the summer season in 1939 was troubled by issues of access to the swimming hole, it was decided to find a new location for the 1940 summer. A site in Killingworth, Connecticut, was chosen. Later, Camp Kvutza was located near Amenia, New York, for several summers. Camp Kvutza changed its name to Camp Habonim and moved to Red Hook, New York, in 1953. In 1962, Camp Habonim changed its name to Na'aleh. Na'aleh relocated to Elizaville, New York, in 1968, where it remained until 1984, when it ceased operations due to low registration and related financial difficulties. In 1998, Habonim Dror re- opened Na'aleh. For three summers, it used rented facilities in Holmes, New York; then it rented space in Shohola, Pennsylvania. In 2008, Na'aleh moved to a campsite in Sidney, New York, where it operated for 7 summers before the summer of 2015 when it moved to a campsite in Windsor, New York and where it remained for its final two summers of operation. Culture Na'aleh tried to simulate a kibbutz environment in which chanichim (campers) lived according to Habonim Dror ideals such as cooperation, equality, and Jewish and Labor Zionist values. Every day except Shabbat, campers performed avodah (work) to improve the camp, such as picking up trash, cleaning the bathrooms, painting, washing dishes, or making repairs to the buildings. Campers were taught Hebrew, Jewish and Israeli history, and learned about social justice issues in the United States and Israel.

The farchie ritual has its roots in the 1799 French invasion of Abruzzo. During this time the French forces had surrounded the town of Fara. Miraculously, Saint Anthony of Abate is said to have appeared and as he did the oak trees surrounding Fara burst into roaring flames. Seeing this, the French soldiers fled Fara thus sparing the town from certain destruction and ruin. In another version of this story the Saint appeared as a general and sent word to the French troops who were very near Fara on their way from Bucchianico towards Guardiagrele. Saint Anthony forbade the French from attacking Fara but they did not heed him and as they approached the nearby oak trees burst into flames thereby engulfing the hapless attacking forces. The first written records documenting the farchie date back to the year 1890. The farchie celebration likely has pagan roots with fire as the main symbolic feature. The burning of the farchie likely served as a form of purification, a protection from evil, and as a talisman of hope that abundant sunshine would lead to abundant crops in the coming warmer months that lie ahead. Historians trace the religious songs that accompany the farchie back to the late renaissance period in Spain during which plays and dramas were enacted portraying the adventures of Saint Anthony Abate in the desert. Calendar of events February \\"Contradaioli\\" (members of one specific Fara neighborhood) begin collecting the materials that will later be used to make the farchie. Green, indigenous canes are harvested and stored for the celebration to be held eleven months hence. Between 15-20 of these canes are bound into a large bundle and place in a dry storage area. The bundles are guarded with some care in that individuals from villages that do not have stands of cane have been known to surreptitiously come to Fara in an attempt to make away with this valuable bounty. In recent years local teens have attempted to carry out pranks involving the stored cane. None to date have been successful. The preparation of the actual farchie entails a great deal of effort and is carried out in a very precise and orderly manner. mid December The contradaioli cut and gather the larger limbs of the purple osier trees. Care is taken to choose limbs that are green and fresh as those without the right amount of humidity tend to break open during the burning process. 12 January \\"Contradaioli\\", that is residents of each of the Fara neighborhoods (Colli, Madonna, Mandrone, Forma, Vicenne, Fara Centro, Crepacci, Campo Lungo, Colle Anzolino, Via S.Antonio or Colle San Donato, Sant'Eufemia, Giardino and Pagnotto) begins the construction of its own farchie. Two or three of the most skilled farchie craftsmen spend the better part of several days working together on this task. The first phase begins with attaching pieces of cane to a large tree trunk or, in some neighborhoods, to a fascia of canes that have been tightly woven together and take the place of the trunk. From this point on additional pieces of cane are bound to the ever growing farchie. The manner in which the farchie are constructed has a great deal to do with their beauty as well as with the manner in which they burn. Care is taken such that the farchie burn in a unified manner from the ‚Äúpiticone‚Äù (bottom of the farchie) to the ‚Äúcima‚Äù or \\"fiocco\\" (the head or top of the farchie that is set on fire. The completed farchie are approximately twenty five feet in length and three feet in diameter. The farchie are constructed to very specific standards. Very important aspects of the farchie include their vertical alignment, the manner in which they are bound, and the correct placement of the canes so as to avoid expansions and twisting motions. Master farchie craftsmen take much pride in adhering to these standards as well as to constructing the farchie to extremely exact measurements. A committee of townspeople provides the funds and the organization necessary to make the farchie festival a success. The construction of the farchie is often carried out over the years by members of the same families. 13 January Local teenagers scour the countryside playing pranks and socializing. In past times these outings were made to gather additional materials for the construction of the farchie. In more recent years the emphasis has been less on foraging and more on celebrating the celebration that is only a few days away. mid January While the men prepare the farchie the women of the town put themselves to the task of preparing large feasts for all to enjoy. About 500 \\"rosette\\" (bread rolls having stamped with a rose bud design) are baked.The \\"Pasto di Sant'Andone\\" (Meal of Saint Anthony) is accompanied by large quantities of the local produced wine. 16 January The day of the main procession. Around noon members of each neighborhood received conduct a brief liturgical service. In the early afternoon of the farchie are brought from neighborhoods all over Fara to the center town piazza located near the church of Saint Anthony Abate. Some are secured to decorated tractors, others are carried on the shoulders of the enthusiastic contradaioli. Tambourine players lead the procession. Straddling the farchie is a contradaioli (known as the \\"trevucette\\") playing a horned instrument. Additional traditional hymns and dirges are chanted by the numerous people who make up each procession. Having arrived at the church the contradaioli manually drop the farchie into a previously dug hole thus placing it in an upright position. Given the great weight and dimensions of farchie this process has in the past been of some danger, this reduced in recent years by communally imposed size limitations. The contradaioli responsible for the mounting of the farchie is the \\"capofarchia\\" (that is, commander of the farchie). Shortly after all or the farchie have individually arrived from their perspective neighborhoods, the main ceremony begins. As the sun sets the farchie are set ablaze and fireworks light up the sky above. Members of the various contradaioli laud praise on their own masterpiece while heatedly denouncing the slightest imperfection they perceive in the farchie of others. After the farchie have been set ablaze the people of Fara begin their festivities. Traditional songs are sung and greatly quantities of food, sweets, and wine are consumed. The statue of Saint Anthony d'Abate is carried on the shoulder of townsmen to the burning farchie where a blessing takes place. As evening approaches the neighbor groups knock over their respective farchie, cut off the burned sections, and then carry the farchie back to their neighborhoods where they are again set on fire. In past times the farchie lighting took place in the town's main piazza. The embers from the farchie were known to damage the doors and windows of nearby homeowners and for this reason this portion of the celebration now takes place on the banks of the Foro river. 17 January A solemn observance is held in front of the RC church dedicated to Saint Anthony of Abate. During a sacred mass the spent farchie, domestic animals, and bread of Saint Anthony are blessed. The rosette rolls are distributed to the townspeople who share them with their livestock and pet so as to ward off illness in the coming year. Traditional foods are served during the farchie celebration. These include crespelle, cauciune, and serpentone. The activities take on a carnival atmosphere. It is thought that the farchie celebration has pagan origins the fire representing the purification of the earth and keeping evil spirits at a distance.
