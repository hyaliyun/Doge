The FOA was founded in 1995 by a group of trainers from industry, government and education who wanted to create industry standards for training and certifying fiber optic technicians. The FOA is a not-for-profit 501(c)6 organization based in California, USA, that has over 200 affiliated training organizations in over 40 countries. FOA approves fiber optic training organizations and certifies their instructors who train designers, installers and operators of all types of fiber optic networks. FOA programs are used by many organizations, companies and trade unions to train and certify their workers. History At the 1994 Fiber U Conference in Boston, the instructors decided that it was time to create a professional society for fiber optics. The instructors represented a number of fiber optic manufacturers including 3M, Siecor/Corning, Panduit and Fotec, two universities which had started fiber optic courses (Wentworth and Lincoln Trail College), two US military services and several independent trainers and consultants. The FOA was incorporated in July 1995 as a non-profit education organization (501(C)6). The founders and some other recruits began meeting to create a certification program. Since the focus of the FOA was technicians not engineers or scientists and there were no good textbooks at the proper level, the first project was to develop a textbook that incorporated the FOA‚Äôs desired technical curriculum. That textbook, The Fiber Optic Technicians Manual, was published in 1997. The FOA advisory group developed the KSAs for the basic certification and tests which covered the knowledge part of the KSAs. By late 1997, the first FOA certifications were granted. Since FOA was founded to be a professional society to set standards for training, not to do training itself, it next set standards to approve schools and certify instructors. Schools already teaching fiber optics around the world were invited to join. Since then over 300 schools have participated in the FOA program and certified 57,000 techs in more than 40 countries. In 2009, FOA expanded its technical web site which now encompasses almost 1000 pages and added free online training at its Fiber U website. At the same time, FOA began to self-publish its reference textbooks in order to provide faster updates and lower costs than were possible with a commercial publisher. In 2012, FOA recognized the dedication and inspiration of its dedicated core of instructors, many of whom had been founders of the FOA and helped its development by awarding them the designation of \\"Master Instructor.\\" These 27 Master Instructors had more than 500 years of experience in fiber optics and several had been teaching for more than 30 years. Certifications FOA offers certifications for basic fiber optics and premises cabling, installation skills, and specific applications. All certifications are based on KSAs - the Knowledge, Skills and Abilities - important to the topics. FOA certifications and KSAs are developed by a worldwide panel of experienced trainers and technicians. All FOA certifications follow ANSI/ISO/IEC STANDARD 17024 ‚Äî General requirements for bodies operating certification of persons. FOA certifications are recognized by the US Department of Labor. =Basic= * CFOT - Certified Fiber Optic Technician covers basic fiber optics for all applications * CPCT - Certified Premises Cabling Technician covers fiber, copper and wireless for premises installation =Skills= * CFOS/S - Certified Fiber Optic Specialist in Splicing * CFOS/C - Certified Fiber Optic Specialist in Connectors * CFOS/T - Certified Fiber Optic Specialist in Testing * CFOS/O - Certified Fiber Optic Specialist in Outside Plant Installation * CFOS/D - Certified Fiber Optic Specialist in Network Design =Application= * CFOS/A - Certified Fiber Optic Specialist in Fiber To The Antenna (Cell Towers) * CFOS/DAS - Certified Fiber Optic Specialist in Distributed Antenna Systems (Wireless) * CFOS/DC - Certified Fiber Optic Specialist in Data Centers * CFOS/H - Certified Fiber Optic Specialist in Fiber To The Home * CFOS/L - Certified Fiber Optic Specialist in Optical LANs Training The Fiber Optic Association offers certification of skills and knowledge in various fiber optic related areas and specialties. FOA does not offer training courses directly. Training courses for FOA certification is only offered by FOA-Approved schools, educational institutions, private training programs, and community development training centers. All schools teaching FOA certifications have been approved through the FOA's School Approval Program. Each instructor teaching FOA certifications has been certified through the FOA's Train-The-Trainer Program. Membership Members of the FOA have demonstrated their knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) in training courses and have successfully passed the FOA certification exam. Experienced industry professionals have applied to FOA directly through the FOA‚Äôs ‚ÄúWork To Cert‚Äù Program for certification based upon their knowledge and skills developed working the field. FOA Corporate Members are organizations and companies involved in the fiber optic industry such as manufacturers, contractors, installers, consultants, etc. Resources The FOA publishes textbooks on fiber optics, premises cabling, outside plant and outside plant construction, and network design. FOA maintains a large online library of technical information and has created over 100 online videos, and free online self-study programs.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on 27 September 2016. It was released for Nintendo Switch on 15 March 2018. The game's name is a play on the word \\"clusterfuck\\", describing \\"a chaotic situation where everything seems to go wrong\\".  Gameplay  In Clustertruck, the player controls a character from a first-person perspective. They are set to jump onto a moving line of trucks, avoiding obstacles and truck pile-ups and crashes. The player is usually unable to touch anything other than trucks, and will otherwise fail their task of reaching the goal at the end of the level. On each stage, the player is scored based on how fast they reach a goal line and a number of style points based on various tricks, such as jumping off a truck that is currently in mid- air. The player's cumulative score points can be used to purchase one of several abilities, such as a double jump or a quick boost of speed, which can then be used to either successfully pass more difficult levels or to improve one's time and scoring on earlier ones.  Development  Development on Clustertruck started in September 2015, after the development on Landfall Games' previous game, Square Brawl, was finished. The game was officially revealed on 16 December 2015 with a trailer and a release date of April 2016. At PAX South 2016, it was announced that Landfall Games had signed a publishing deal with tinyBuild. This deal led the developers to push the release date to the third quarter of 2016, where Landfall Games CEO Wilhem Nylund said that it was \\"initially intended for the game to be a small project with a short development\\", but changed his mind and considered the game to be delayed even further, as it has \\"gaining more and more traction.\\" As an April Fool's Day joke, Landfall released a free demo version of Clustertruck called Supertruck that incorporated the visual style and mechanic of the recently released Superhot, in which the internal clock within the game moves forward when the player-character moves. Landfall released preview copies of the game to various YouTube and Twitch streamers to help promote the title. The game was released on 27 September 2016.

After shooting the officer, Durham's vehicle was rendered inoperable via a spike strip south in Waldport, where he fled on foot and began shooting at a crab fisherman in Alsea Bay before disappearing. Durham's whereabouts remain unknown. Disappearance At approximately 10:58 pm on January 23, 2011, police officer Steven Dodds pulled over a 1984 Dodge pickup truck owned by David Anthony Durham, of Sauvie Island, Portland, Oregon, for a routine traffic violation in Lincoln City, Oregon. During the interaction, Durham told Dodds that he was driving to a military base in California. At some point during the traffic stop, Durham shot Dodds multiple times in the chest, critically injuring him, and then fled in his vehicle, heading south on Highway 101. Responding police officers spotted Durham's vehicle in Newport, and disabled his vehicle with a spike strip near Waldport, just north of the Alsea Bay Bridge. Unable to further drive his vehicle, Durham fled on foot into the woods on the west side of the highway; Durham's dog, which was in his vehicle, fled to the east. Shortly after, a crab fisherman working by spotlight on Alsea Bay reported gunshots originating from the spit, but could not see the gunman in the darkness. Three days after Durham's disappearance, his dog was found wandering in Waldport. Investigation An extensive search for Durham took place in the days following his disappearance by local, state and federal law enforcement officers; SWAT teams were also instated. Police performed a house-by-house search across Waldport and Bayshore, a community immediately north of Alsea Bay. Despite the extensive search, authorities were unable to locate Durham, and there have been no verified sightings of him since the evening of January 23, 2011. Initially, law enforcement theorized that Durham may have been hiding in an abandoned house in the woods or in one of the area's numerous vacant vacation homes. Another possibility raised by law enforcement was that Durham had attempted to swim across Alsea Bay and drowned. A friend of Durham's said that in the months prior to his disappearance, he had been acting erratically and displaying signs of paranoia: \\"He was definitely going through something. We just didn't know how serious it was.\\" She also added that she believed Durham was dead. Durham's brother Michael told The Oregonian that Durham had sustained a shoulder injury in the months prior to his disappearance, and had been prescribed pain medication that altered his mental state. He also stated he believed Durham may have been hiding at a house in Manzanita owned by his employer. Prior to his disappearance, Durham had told several friends and family members that he was planning on relocating to the Caribbean. His employer at Willamette Print & Blueprints Co. Inc in Portland notified police that he had failed to show up to work on Friday, January 21, and that he had not been heard from since. Aftermath A Federal arrest warrant for Durham was issued January 29, 2011, and as of 2020 is still outstanding. Durham was profiled on the television series America's Most Wanted shortly after his disappearance.

She is 16-years old and the first princess of Misurugi. Before the events of the series, she is designated to be the next in line to inherit the throne, but she is a Norma who grows up believing that she could use Mana. On the day of her coronation she is exposed by her ambitious brother, Julio, who strips her of all royal privileges and exiled to the island of Arzenal, where she faces the harsh reality of being a mail-rider who is drafted to fight the DRAGONs, in which she must now struggle everyday to stay alive or be killed by the DRAGONs. :Initially unwilling to accept her true identity as a Norma, she sees and treats other Norma as \\"things\\" much to the anger of those around her even after coming to terms with the truth. Proud and antisocial, she does not converse with others, talks only when talked to and fights back when ridiculed. After spending several days with Tusk on a deserted island she begins to opens up to others. Despite this, she is quite skilled in using a Para-mail and has good physical abilities. The only remaining possession she has from her old life is a special ring given to her by her mother that is suggested to have Mana powers which can activate her Para-mail called the \\"Villkiss\\", which was originally used by Jill during her days as a mail-rider, with or without a pilot and even from a distance. Momoka, her ever loyal maid, later on follows her to the island by stowing away in a transport ship where she continues being Ange's maid becomes her roommate. Ange comes to realize the true nature of the Mana society upon facing discrimination and hanging by Julio and the people she once cared about, and Ange chastises her old self who thought there ever was peace in the world.

After Zola is killed, she is promoted to the rank of Captain, but seems to have trouble dealing with unexpected situations on the battlefield. According to Vivian, she is known to read romance novels with mature content. She resents Ange for disobeying her orders and attacks the DRAGONs alone but is convinced to think otherwise after Mei tells her that she believes Ange does so in order to keep others from being killed. Mei's claim is supported by the fact that upon checking her captain's log, Salia noticed that ever since Ange joined the unit, (and after Coco, Miranda, and Zola's deaths) there have been no casualties during their previous missions. :It is revealed that during her free time, Salia would rent a changing room from Jasmine where she would cosplay as a magical girl based on a book she reads, as a way of venting and relieving her stress. Her secret is discovered by Ange who inadvertently enters the changing room she was using. Salia, greatly embarrassed, later attempts to kill Ange but is unsuccessful. So far Ange is the only one who knows about Salia's secret hobby. Salia greatly admires Jill, who was called Alektra in the past, since she was a child. Upon witnessing a severely wounded Alektra return in defeat during a rebellion, the young Salia vows to exact revenge. Jill initially vows to give her the \\"Villkiss\\" up until Ange's arrival, and Salia becomes dismayed. Despite Jill's objections, she pilots the Villkiss and after realizing that Ange is meant to pilot the Villkiss, is detained for insubordination. :Currently she is the head of the Diamond Rose Knights of Embryo. When she was last beaten by Ange, she gave up on thinking Ange and Jill threw her away, but Embryo rescued her and showed her a new life. She is in love with Embryo, but overhearing his talks to Ange with his plans and desire to marry her, Salia lets Ange escape, and she is determined to be with Embryo and desires to kill Ange.

Zola's lover. After Zola is killed and Salia taking over the command of the First Unit, she becomes the second-in-command. Because Ange is directly responsible for Zola's death, Hilda's resentment towards her causes her to sabotage her Para-mail in retaliation. According to Ersha, Hilda's personality was similar to Ange's when the she was still new to Arzenal. Even after Zola's death, she still longs for her sexual prowess that she now turns to Rosalie and Chris to satisfy her sexual desires. :Years before the events of the series, she resents being in Arzenal and that she always desires to escape from the island to order to see her mother again who lives in the Enderant Union. An opportunity came during the \\"Festa Festival\\" where she aids Ange's escape by hijacking Misty's transport. Though Ange intends to leave her behind as revenge for her bullying, she has a change of heart after learning her reason for helping her escape. Upon returning home, Hilda realizes that her mother had almost completely forgotten about her and has a new daughter who is also named Hilda as the memory of her eldest daughter has devastated her. Hilda leaves at her mother's request and when she and Ange return to Arzenal, they decide to swear to destroy the twisted world they live in. Eventually, she replaces Salia as commander of the First Unit. :Hilda recently went through some serious soul searching after Ange was sent to the other Earth and when Ange was captured by Salia realized how much she cares for Ange.

During the preparation for the final assault Hilda reveals her feelings to Ange and calls Ange her \\"prince\\" but is concerned because Ange has \\"a princess for a friend and a man\\", and expresses concern over the fact that her feelings are weird since they're both girls, but Ange relieves her of those fears by kissing Hilda and telling her that she'll need her in the new world, surprising her. ; : :Another mail-rider of the First Unit, who has short pinkish-red hair and is always seen with a lollipop in her mouth. Unlike the rest of her unit, she's rather friendly towards Ange. She is always cheerful and enjoys asking quizzes to her squad mates. It is revealed that she is a DRAGON and the lollipops keep her in human form, hence why, by instinct, she enjoys Ange's song. Later, Vivan (in her DRAGON form), Ange, and Tusk are sent to an alternate Earth that has long been destroyed by war and humanity has been wiped out. :She is reunited with her mother after 10 years and wishes to introduce her mother to Ersha and her other friends. ; : :An older mail- rider with short orange hair, who is always seen with Hilda and Chris.

She, together with Hilda and Chris engage in a form of m√©nage √† trois in Zola's room which is now owned by Hilda. After she and the rest of the unit are saved by Ange from a new and very powerful DRAGON, she finally accepts and befriends Ange. Upon learning that Hilda was simply using her, Chris, and Zola as a means of achieving her goals, Rosalie becomes increasingly resentful towards her during her abandonment. They later make amends when Julio and his army invade Arzenal. She has feelings for Chris and wants to rescue her from Embryo. ; : :A senior mail-rider with long pink hair, and acts as a mother figure to her unit especially to Vivian/Mii, but is terrifying when angered that even Hilda wouldn't dare cross.

She is also happens to be a chef who would sometimes be assigned to cook for the entire personnel. :Also a member of Embryo's Diamond Rose Knights as repayment for saving the children lost during Juilo's attack on Arzenal. She is the Principal of the Kindergarten that Embryo set up for those children, but appears to realize that there are strings attached to his help compared to Salia and Chris when the true colors of Embryo is revealed she returns to her friends. ; : :An older mail-rider with silver hair tied with a braid. She is usually shy and introverted, so she's always with Hilda and Rosalie where they engage in a lesbian m√©nage √† trois. She, too, initially despised Ange who was responsible for Zola's death early in the series but eventually accepted and befriended her along with Rosalie after Ange saved the entire unit from being killed by a new powerful DRAGON. Upon learning that Hilda was simply using her, Rosalie, and Zola as a means of achieving her goals, Chris becomes increasingly resentful towards her. They later make amends when Julio and his army invade Arzenal. She is shot during the battle and nearly dies until Embryo appears and heals her using Mana. :Another of Embryo's Diamond Rose Knights. After healing her, she was told she was abandoned (not realizing that Hilda and Rosalie were looking for her after Ange engaged Julio's fleet.) Feeling abandoned she accepts Embryo's offer of companionship and friendship. After being abandoned again, Chris angrily drives to destroy everything, until Rosalie risks her life to regain Chris' spirit, who loves her. ; : :Jill, also known as , is the supreme commander of Arzenal. Jill is the first pilot of the \\"Villkiss\\" and is presumed to be responsible for Tusk's parents' death. Despite the rule that Normas are not allowed to have any personal property in the island, she gives back the ring Ange inherited from her deceased mother which suggests that she is aware it contains Mana that only Ange can use. She also willingly allows Ange to \\"buy\\" Momoka, aware that the latter was secretly going to be sentenced to death for discovering the existence of Arzenal and the DRAGONs (both of which are highly classified information) had she departed the base after her \\"visit\\" under the Arzenal \\"rule\\" that one can buy anything with enough money. :She is actually the first Norma to be born of royal blood, where she used to have the title as the \\"First Princess of the Galia Empire\\" and she is also condemned and exiled to Arzenal to fight the DRAGONs. She is the first to be able to unlock the \\"Villkiss\\" thus allowing her to pilot it which eventually led to a rebellion called \\"Libertas\\". During this time, she falls in love with Tusk's father, Istvan though unrequited. Dismayed by this, she easily falls to Embryo's manipulation, which leads to the failure of \\"Libertas\\". Years later, she intends to kill Embryo in her next \\"Libertas\\" plan, using the DRAGONs as decoys. Although eventually stripped of command when she reveals the failure of the first Libertas, Jill helps Ange and her allies fight Embryo. After Embryo mortally wounds her, Jill assures Salia that she is like a sister to her as she dies. ; : :The only Mana user in Arzenal and Jill's second-in- command, who takes rules very seriously. Like all Mana users, she views Normas as \\"things\\" or inhuman, it is suggested that she works for the Rosenblums and that her function isn't just being the island's second-in-command but also being the island's caretaker where she oversees its overall functions. After being nearly killed by Julio's forces and saved by Jill, she now drowns her sorrows with alcohol and gives her full support to the Libertas. As the truth about Mana is known, Emma comes to understand the Norma. ; : :She is one of the technical staff in charge of maintaining the Para-mails, she is also in charge of salvaging downed Para-mails as well as rescuing downed mail-riders who are either alive or dead. She claims to be able to somewhat understand the feelings the Para-mail's pilot when she does maintenance on them. She had an older sister named who was in the same unit as Jill during the latter's days as a Para-mail rider but was killed during a rebellion with Jill as the sole survivor of their unit. ; : :The cybernetics repair expert, who is also the island's resident medic where she always excited at the sight of blood. ; : :An older woman and a friend of Jill, she is a veteran mail rider who has retired and has been running the giant marketplace \\"Jasmine Mall\\" within Arzenal ever since. She's always accompanied by her dog, John. However, she is a shrewd businesswoman who takes full advantage of her business monopoly in the island. She is also well aware and informed the many goings on within the top command of Arzenal and is the one in charge of keeping in contact with Tusk. It was revealed later on that she is the first Norma to be in command of Arzenal and the only one who has established contact with the ancient people. ; : :Zola is the captain of the first unit (where Ange is assigned to) whose right eye is artificial. She is Hilda's lover, yet despite of it, she is promiscuous and a hedonist with a preference for new cadets.

His parents are Para- mail riders who are killed in combat with Jill and the \\"Villkiss\\" years before the events of the series thus he recognizes it immediately when he found Ange on the beach. He is also knowledgeable about repairing Para-mails after studying the various Para-mail parts that wash up on the island he lives on. Despite many awkward moments with Ange, he has saved her life twice and eventually falls in love with her and even asks her to leave the island with him though she refuses. It is Ange's meeting and time spent with him that helps her change her attitude towards the others in Arzenal. :After leaving the island he keeps in contact with Arzenal through Jasmine claiming that he will continue reconnaissance of the Misurugi Empire while searching for his comrades. He later infiltrates the Misurugi Empire and saves Ange as she is about to be sentenced to death by Julio and calls himself a Knight of the Villkiss. Later, he, Ange, and Vivian are transported to an alternate Earth that has been destroyed by war and humanity has been wiped out. :Tusk is part of the mission to free Ange and the others from Embryo, killing Embryo several times in order to protect Ange. He was presumed dead by Ange, but somehow he escaped the deadmans vest with Momaka and has been reunited with her. The two made love and they agree to protect the world. :A running gag throughout the series is that Tusk ends up with his face in Ange's crotch by accident. ; : :She is the Chief Communications Control Operator for Arzenal. ; : :She is the Chief Dispatcher for Arzenal. ; : :She is the Novice Communications Operator for Arzenal. ; : :Eleanor, who has masculine voice, is a veteran mail-rider and is the captain of the second unit, the Eleanor Squad. She pilots a para- mail painted in red. After she makes a sortie, her unit is eventually annihilated in an attack by Salamandine. ; : :She is the woman who has distinct purple hair and a high-class air to her. She is also a member of the Betty Squad. She is captured by an unmanned weapon called \\"Pyrethroid\\". She is a member of the Diamond Rose Knights until Embryo used her as a decoy that is devoured by a DRAGON. ; : :Tanya's roommate. ; :She has brown hair. She is a member of the Betty Squad. ; :She has blonde hair. She is a member of the Betty Squad. ; :She has yellow green hair. She is a member of the Betty Squad. ; :Ann is a boyish mail-rider, who is killed by three DRAGONs before Ange is sent to Arzenal. ; : :Mary is a new-fledged Mail-rider who is assigned to the para-mail squadron of Aurora. She is in the middle of studying as a cadet- rider, but she has experienced real battles due to force repletion. She is the oldest among recruits and offers stewardship to them. ; : :She is a novice mail-rider trained by Rosalise and is apart of a para-mail squadron aboard the Aurora. ; : :She is one of the new recruits, who greatly admires Vivian. She was killed by an insane Chris. =Empire of Misurugi= ; : :He is the Emperor of Misurugi and Ange's father. Like his wife Empress Sophia, he is aware that Ange is a Norma but kept it secret to protect his daughter. When Julio revolts and exposes the truth about Ange and after Sophia is killed in her attempt to escape with Ange, a grief stricken July is captured and sentenced to death for his deception. ; : :She was the Empress of Misurugi and Ange's mother who has always known that her eldest daughter was a Norma but decides to keep it from her until the day of Ange's coming of age ceremony during which Julio, who has found out about it, decides to expose her in public. Fearing for Ange's safety, they attempt to escape but failed. She rescues Ange at the cost of her own life. Before dying, she relinquishes her ring to Ange the night before the ceremony, that contains part of her mana where it is implied that the mana in the ring has infused with the \\"Villkiss\\" Para-mail that Ange now uses. ; : :The oldest child and only male of the Misurugi royal family and Ange's older brother. He is highly ambitious and power hungry as he desires the throne of Misurugi for himself going so far as to expose the truth about Ange being a Norma to the public during the latter's coming of age ceremony. After his mother's death, he has his father executed, and claims himself the new Emperor of the Misurugi Empire. He is ruthless as the news of his mother's sudden death does not seem to affect him but he also appears to show affection to his youngest sister Sylvia. He exiles Ange to Arzenal, but Ange is tenacious of life, so he comes up with the idea of using Ange to restore the Influence of the discredited royal household. After he uses Momoka and Silvia, and purposely provides Ange with an opportunity to flee from Arzenal, to lure Ange into coming to the Imperial Palace, Julio intends to sentence Ange to death to strengthen his political foundation, but his plans were thwarted by Tusk. In a summit conference of government leaders, he is the first man to agree with Embryo's opinion, and commands the squadron to invade Arzenal to capture Ange. He sends soldiers armed with an assault rifles and flame throwers and unmanned flying weapons, and commands them to erase the Norma and arrest the Mail- rider. When Ange confronts the helpless Julio at point blink range, he is revealed to be a total coward. However, he is instead killed by Embryo for his foolishness. ; : :The youngest daughter of the Misurugi royal family and Ange's younger sister. She is a paraplegic who lost the used of her lower extremities which was a result of the accident that she sustained when she fell off a horse while riding with Ange many years ago, Ange blames herself for it and promises that she will protect her, she uses a mana powered floating chair to move around. The shock of learning the truth about her sister causes her to faint. It is hinted that she was the one who assisted Momoka in locating Ange as she later tries to secretly contact her using her mana asking her whether or not she has found Ange yet but was \\"caught and taken away\\" before Ange could speak to her. This is later revealed to be a trick to lure Ange back home so that Sylvia can exact revenge on her sister. She later discovers Liza's secret and is captured by her. Eventually, Ange reveals that Sylvia's wounds have been healed and that she did not attempt to walk because of the trauma, forcing her sister to walk once again. Sylvia deeply regrets her hatred towards Ange. After the end of the war, with her world deprived of the Light of Mana and torn apart by chaos and anarchy, she leads a squad of survivors along the ruins of Misurugi defending people from marauders. ; : :Julio's personal bodyguard and mistress, who is manipulating him for her own goals. It is revealed she's also a DRAGON in human form, in actuality possessing wings and a tail. She was sent by the other DRAGONs as a spy to find out the whereabouts of the First DRAGON, Aura, who was captured by Embryo. However, Embryo captures her after Julio's death, and forces her to lead Salamandine's fleet into a trap. Liza is seen tortured by a mad Sylvia until Momoka comforts her and escape. Liza joins \\"Last Libertas\\" for the final battle, and settles with Ange and the DRAGONs in the True Earth. ; : :She is Ange's top maid who had been serving her since childhood. She admires Ange greatly because of the kindness and compassion the latter showed her when they were both children. She uses Mana not only to perform her duty as a maid but also to protect her from harm since she was aware that Ange is incapable of using Mana and, just like Sophia, she too kept it secret from Ange. :Her utmost dedication towards Ange is so great that she stowed away in a transport ship to Arzenal to find her then is discovered in the base but was allowed to stay for a few days by Jill. She is shocked to learn how much Ange's personality had changed during their time away from each other. She tries to bring Ange back to her old self but fails unaware of the pain, hardship and danger Ange endured before her arrival. As she was about to leave the base, Ange \\"buys\\" her with a very large amount of money which Jill accepts knowing that Momoka would be executed for discovering the existence of Arzenal and the DRAGONs both of which are highly classified information. She now lives with Ange in the latter's room continuing her duties as Ange's maid and confidant forever. :During the attack of the Misurugi Empire, she rescues Ange from Embryo by stabbing him and pushing him off a cliff, and survives. She and Emma are the only Mana users who settle down with the Norma. ; :Serra is an infant and the first Norma whom Angelise met. Serra is taken away by police agents, through her mother. Serra's mother is the very few Mana users to hold little prejudice towards Norma. Serra's further fate is unknown. Unlike Hilda's mother and most people of the Misurugi Empire, Serra's mother refused to replace Serra with another child, and her hate for Angelise ain't because she is a Norma (something Ange herself wasn't even aware of at the time), but because she allowed her daughter to be taken. ; : :She is the schoolgirl of Hououin, who is a friend of Angelise until she was found to be a Norma. When encountering Ange again, she secretly tried to report her but Ange stops her. Realizing there is no equality among the people of Misurugi Empire, Ange breaks her friendship with Akiho for good. =Kingdom of Rosenblum= ; : :She is a Princess of the Kingdom of Rosenblum. She first appears as one of opposing teams whom Angelise competes with in some sort of para-mail Lacrosse before she is expose as a \\"Norma\\". After the championship, she had admired Angelise's excellence. Her family is one of the few elites who knows about the clandestine operations in Arzenal and it is suggested that they are also one of the few who manages it. She went to the island during the \\"Festa Festival\\" to learn the fate of Ange but she ended up as her hostage where her transport was used as a means to escape. It is hinted that Misty doesn't discriminate Norma. =People of Aura= ; : :A Princess from the Freya DRAGON clan, and is capable of controlling other DRAGONs with the song \\"El Ragna\\". She pilots the Ryu-Shing-Ki Enryugo that is capable of shooting a beam that disintegrates anything in its path and almost destroyed Arzenal. Also, she showed interest in Ange, who released the hidden power of Villkiss in a battle, so she made Ange experience a hallucination which made her feel like she passed through space and time. :When Ange, Tusk and Vivian are transported to her world, she treats them warmly and reveals the truth to Ange about what happened to the True Earth and about Aura. Salamandine later tries to convince Ange to aid them in locating and freeing Aura which, in the process, would free Normas of all the discrimination they had suffered for years which coincides with Ange's goals. After what looks to be an unstable singular point opens and destroys part of the city, Ange and Salamandine work together to stop it and later become friends. Ange then gives her the nickname \\"Salako\\" due to the name \\"Salamandine\\" being too hard for her to pronounce. ; : :She is member of Salamandine's entourage and is a swordswoman. A pilot of the Ryu-Shing-Ki Soryugo, but if there are people who try to do wrong to Salamandine, Naga openly displays her hostility. Due to her deep love, she sometimes lose control of herself. ; : :She is member of Salamandine's entourage and makes full use of Naginata. A pilot of the Ryu-Shing-Ki Hekiryugo. Naga and Kaname have served Salamandine since they were young, and they are the close friends. Kaname is the staff officer of Sala, a discreet person who has the capacity to see the big picture. ; : :She is a princess who is rare for a direct line of the Aura, which have the oldest history of DRAGON. Young as she is, she is elected as the supreme leader, and the ardent wish of her is to try to recapture Aura. ; : :The doctor in charge among the DRAGONs. On the True Earth, she hatches up a plan that uses Tusk as a sample of the sex education because there are few men of the human type. She sometimes acts a bit unrestrained and overdoes things but everybody recognizes her ability. ; : :She is Vivian's mother who separated from Vivian and lost contact with her ten years ago. She reunites with her beloved daughter, Mii, who had gone missing across the singular point. Her hobby is to quiz others too. ; : :The first DRAGON. She is the Mother and origin of all Mana users. Embryo captured Aura for his own ideal peace. She was freed by Ange and Salamandine and returns to the True Earth. =Others= ; : :The main antagonist of the series who is wrapped in mystery. Embryo resents the world from a position which is one step higher than that of the administrators. He owns the lost weapons and techniques of ancient times. He has piloted the Black Ragna-mail \\"Hysterica\\" which has six wings and has a form similar to Ange's Villkiss. He also knows the same song as Sala and Ange which he uses to control Hysterica, the more powerful prototype of current Para-mails. He once annihilated Jill's squad before the latter's rebellion, thus making him her arch-nemesis. He is the turner of the Mana system by confining the Mother of DRAGONs, Aura, and used her life force as factor energy, and is able to heal fatal injuries with Mana. However, he is unable to convert every human (only females) into Mana users upon birth. The Light of Mana has given the people a life without struggle; however, creating a flawed that they remain stagnate and misinterpret mutual equality, which is why the \\"Norma\\" are oppressed without reason, thus proclaimed the false belief that \\"Norma\\" are a sin to society and relocate them to Arzenal, to the advantage of Embryo making the Norma and DRAGONs fight each other as a cover-up to harvest the Dragnium crystals that are inside the bodies of the DRAGONs in order to re-supply Aura. Leading Embryo to know humanity can never suppress the sense of immorality, going as far to destroy and re-create the worlds. :He is miserable with the direction that the human race has taken, thinking them as toys and needs Ange, Aura, and the Villkiss to merge False Earth with True Earth. He can control the minds of all who use Mana, and can corrupt those who do not by manipulating their insecurities. He eventually convinces Chris, Ersha and Salia to join his side. Embryo fights Ange and her squadron for the final time in the timeless universe. Ange theorizes that Norma were born to resist and balance the universe. After being fatally wounded by Ange and Tusk and with no means of escaping his permanent death, Embryo disintegrates and the two worlds are restored. Mecha = Villkiss = :Called the Weapon of God by Tusk was Jill's machine during the first revolt against Embryo and given to Ange after her first failed sorte. It is a medium/close range combat machine using an assault rifle and sword as its armament. When Ange and Tusk were in the Real Earth, she saw a black Ragna- Mail (from where all Para-mails are copied from) that looked like her Villkiss destroy the Draconic reactors and wipe out most of the population. Ange seems to have a deeper connection to the Villkiss as she has been known to insult it in times of need and it responds to the situation, showing that it might not be just a machine. These are the currently known abilities that have appeared with the link through Ange's ring, but Ange feels there is something still hiding in the Villkiss' core. Twice the Villkiss has restored itself from damage that would cripple or destroy normal machines. Blue Villkiss (Flight) :This mode gives the Villkiss a boost of speed in flight and the ability to teleport, even across dimensions - though Ange does not know how to control where it ends up for now. Red Villkiss (Assault) :Shown during the invasion of Arzenal, there is an increase of maneuverability and power. The sword becomes an energy blade with an extended range that can slash through the toughest armour with ease. Gold Villkiss (Cannon) :When Ange sings the Song of the Stars, two openings appear on the shoulders priming the Space Dimensional cannons. These cannons are capable to destroying anything in front of them, or able to cancel out another Space Dimensional cannon shot (which she used is stopping Salia in the battle of Arzenal and to stop Embryo's attack on the Real Earth).

It is native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea and parts of the Middle East, where it grows in coastal and inland salt marshes, alkali flats, and other habitats with saline soils. Description Arthrocnemum macrostachyum is a much-branched subshrub growing in clumps up to a metre high (3 ft). The plants have horizontal woody stems that may root at the nodes, branching into erect, jointed, succulent green stems. The leaves are small and scale-like, clasping the stem but with the tips free. The flowers are minute, produced in threes in terminal, cylindrical spikes. The perianth is conical and has three teeth. The hermaphrodite flowers are wind- pollinated, and the fruit is small, has a membranous pericarp, and contains a single seed. Distribution and habitat A. macrostachyum is found around the coasts bordering on the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, and ranges northwards into the Jordan Valley. It is also present in the Middle East, including Iran and Pakistan, where it grows in the muddy coastal swamps immediately inland from the mangroves (Avicennia marina) that border the coast. In the delta region of the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, it dominates some plant communities in the salt marsh habitats. Research In a study, plants of A. macrostachyum were germinated at six sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations, and grew best at 200 to 400 mM NaCl. It was found that the plants were salt-tolerant and grew well at a range of salt concentrations. About 60% of their dry mass was ash, and the plants were capable of accumulating a substantial quantity of sodium and chlorine ions. The seeds of many halophytes germinate after rains which reduce the salinity levels of the soil surface layer. A. macrostachyum can germinate at salinity levels of at least 800 mM NaCl, and at even higher concentrations in the presence of added calcium ions. Research was undertaken into the remediation of oil-contaminated soil in the Persian Gulf. The marshland concerned was covered by an algal mat but was otherwise vegetation-free. The creation of drainage channels was followed by the return of crabs to the affected areas close to the channels. They churned up the mud and increased the oxygen content, which was quickly followed by the germination of A. macrostachyum, Halocnemum strobilaceum and Salicornia europaea. The crabs advanced into the polluted area at the rate of about one metre per year (3 ft), resulting in a gradual increase in the vegetated area. A. macrostachyum tolerates levels of cadmium in the soil that other plants find toxic. It can bioaccumulate the metal and play a role in the phytoremediation of sites contaminated by cadmium. The seeds of A. macrostachyum contain between 22% and 25% oil, with an unsaturated fatty acid content of 65% to 74%, and are being investigated as a possible source of edible oil.

Platform Driveway is a cloud-based telematics platform deployed via drivers‚Äô smartphones. The mobile application detects vehicle signature, location, mileage, trip date and time, acceleration, braking, cornering, speeding, and day and night garage location. It scores the data using a customizable formula and transmits it to the insurer in real-time through an insurer admin portal. Insurers may use the solution to view data on individual drivers; they may also view combined data grouped by driver demographics such as age or geography. The Driveway app also sends real-time feedback to drivers, including individual driver score, tips and optional value-added services.

The goal of the workshop was to lay down the foundations of a prototype semantic representation language for the GDML. The workshop's organizers recognized that the extremely wide scope of mathematics as a whole made it unrealistic to map out the detailed concepts, structures, and operations needed and used in individual mathematical subjects. The workshop therefore limited itself to surveys of the status quo in mathematical representation languages including representation of prominent and fundamental theorems in certain areas that could serve as building blocks for additional mathematical results, and to discussing ways to best identify and design semantic components for individual disciplines of mathematics. The workshop organizers are presently preparing a report summarizing the workshop's conclusions and making recommendations for further progress towards a GDML.

He graduated violin and theory at the College Musical Belge in Antwerp, where he worked with lessons from Hugo Godron. A good friend of that time was a painter and violinist Theo Kroeze. In 1941 he obtained a state diploma of theory and violin in The Hague. He was taught by Leo Smit. Kattenburg and his family were hiding in Utrecht. On 5 May 1944 he was arrested during a raid. He was then transported to camp Westerbork and sent to Auschwitz between 22 May and 30 September 1944. He wrote about thirty songs. This included solo pieces and chamber music and orchestral works. He wrote some Jewish and Palestine songs which he called Romanian folk music. It was thought that there had been preserved only one composition from him.

The first local convert was Christopher Mwitumwa in 1954. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith has expanded considerably in Zambia since then, with estimates placing its following at around 1.7% of the population. The Bah√° º√≠ community of Zambia oversees several social initiatives, for instance in education with an emphasis on girls' education. Statistics The number of Bah√° º√≠s in Zambia was estimated at 162,443 in 2000, or 1.70% of the total population, according to Adherents.com. The site ranks this as the sixteenth- highest national proportion of Bah√° º√≠s in the world. It also ranks Zambia's as the tenth-largest national Bah√° º√≠ community in the world in absolute terms, and the fourth-largest in Africa. The Association of Religion Data Archives gives a Bah√° º√≠ population of 241,112 in 2010, or 1.7% of Zambia's population. Based on its estimates (which differ to some extent from Adherents.com's), this represents the fifth-highest proportion of Bah√° º√≠s of any country. Both these sources rely on World Christian Encyclopedia, with data from the respective years. According to the Wolfram Alpha knowledge base, 1.8% of people in Zambia are Bah√° º√≠, making the Bah√° º√≠ Faith the third-largest religion after Christianity (83%) and indigenous religions (13% in total). According to the official website of the Bah√° º√≠s of Zambia, there were over 4,000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2018. History In 1952 Eric Manton became the first Bah√° º√≠ pioneer to Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia, part of the British-administered Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland) as well as the first to southern Africa when he arrived from Britain in along with his twelve-year-old son. He was joined by Ethna Archibald of New Zealand in 1955. The first native Zambian convert was Christopher Mwitumwa, an ethnic Lozi, in 1954. The first Local Spiritual Assembly was formed in Fisenge in 1956, followed by Assemblies in Kitwe and Luanshya. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Zambia was at first confined to the Copperbelt Province, but in 1962 it spread to the North-Western Province when seven people declared themselves Bah√° º√≠s at a devotional meeting in Mwinilunga. The first National Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1967. The following year it was officially incorporated and the premises for a national Bah√° º√≠ centre were obtained. Beginning in 1975, annual national conferences have been held in Zambia on teaching the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, and in 1983 the Continental Board of Counsellors for Africa met in Zambia for the first time. In 1998, the first Regional Bah√° º√≠ Council in Zambia was formed to serve North-Western Province. Social Initiatives The William Mmutle Masetlha Foundation (WMMF), an organization founded in 1995 and run by the Zambian Bah√° º√≠ community, specializes in providing vocational training and education. It is responsible for the affairs of both the William Mmutle Masetlha Institute and the Banani International Secondary School. The Masetlha Institute was founded in 1983, and is particularly active in areas such as literacy and primary health care. The Banani International Secondary School, which was founded in 1993, is a residential school for girls focused on agriculture and science, and was listed as one of Africa's top one hundred secondary schools in 2003.

It is currently a 4 branch system consisting of the Downtown Library, the Centennial Library, the Law Library, and a Bookmobile. History In early 1903, women of the Ninety-Nine Club and the Time and Tide Club formed a corporation known as the Midland Library Association. They applied for a charter on March 11 of that year. The library was built on the corner of West Wall and Colorado Streets on two lots costing $125. The library building itself cost $1550. The Association had its first meeting in the new library building on 11 June 1904. It was decided that each member of the Association would serve as librarian for one week each in alphabetical order. Books were donated. In September 1916, The Midland Reporter described the library as, ‚ÄúA very handsome little building, centrally located and free from debt. It is not a Carnegie affair, nor has it had outside assistance of any kind, not even a county or city donation. We credit it to the ladies of the city, who secured private subscription to build it, and who have maintained it by their own efforts. It is nicely furnished, has more than 1000 volumes, and is a very popular place for sundry social gatherings.‚Äù In October 1927, a campaign was begun to convert the library into a county library, and this was accomplished on 1 January 1929. Also in 1929, a petition was circulated asking that the library be moved to the basement of the new courthouse, and this was done. In 1949, the library became a project of the Altrusa Club which organized the Friends of the Library. In 1956, they circulated a petition for a bond election to build a new library building. This was approved and construction at 301 West Missouri Street began in 1957. The 28,000 square foot building was finished in the summer of 1958 at a cost of $400,000. By 1971, the library owned a total of 100,000 books which qualified it as a library of the First Class in the American Library Association. The Midland Centennial Branch Library opened at the Midland Park Mall in late 1984. It was moved to the Imperial Shopping Center in 2004. By 1990, the library collection had outgrown the building, and the Friends of the Library again circulated a petition asking the county commissioners for a 20,000 square foot addition to the Downtown facility. The commissioners voted unanimously for the addition, and it was completed in 1993 at a cost of about $2.5 million.

(Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they investigate the appearance of a new Inhuman. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Monica Owusu- Breen, and directed by Ron Underwood. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, Adrianne Palicki, Henry Simmons, and Luke Mitchell. \\"Bouncing Back\\" originally aired on ABC on March 8, 2016, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 3.52 million viewers.  Plot  The episode opens with a mysterious flash-forward to three months in the future, showing an unidentified S.H.I.E.L.D. agent being killed in an explosion in space. In Bogot√°, Colombia, Elena Rodriguez, an Inhuman with super-speed (but who can only travel a certain distance between heartbeats, before being teleported back to the point from which she started), steals a large amount of weapons from the Colombian police. The next day Daisy, Mack, Morse, Hunter and Joey investigate the thefts, but Mack is abducted by Elena. The team track them down and subdue Elena, but she later explains that the police are corrupt, and she has been using her newfound powers (which she believes to be a gift from God) to stop them from hurting innocents. Hunter and Morse find her cousin Francisco disposing of the weapons in a river, but the police arrive, including Lucio, an Inhuman with paralytic vision. Lucio immobilises Francisco, who is executed, and Hunter and Morse, who are abducted. Daisy, Mack, Elena and Joey attack the police station and rescue Hunter and Morse, while Lucio is defeated when Joey welds his sunglasses to his face, after which he is abducted by Hydra. Back in the US, Coulson (now the director of SHIELD again) and May meet with President Ellis at Rosalind Price's abandoned apartment. With Price having vouched for SHIELD before her death, Ellis has decided to let them continue dealing with the Inhuman threat as a 'black ops' unit, and to have the new head of the ATCU answer to Coulson. Elsewhere, Malick has been tending to the ancient Inhuman, who is very weak from the millennia of clinging to life, but is growing stronger, promising that Malick's faith in his capabilities is not misplaced. He also displays one of his powers, to disperse Ward's body into a mass of particles, and vows to 'make a believer' of Giyera. To find Malick, Coulson uses Garrett's mind probe, in conjunction with Lincoln's powers, on a vegetative Werner von Strucker, who awakens long enough to inform them of a location where Malick can be contacted. There Coulson finds a phone, through which he calls Malick, while May traces the call to a number of locations worldwide, where Malick's various companies can be found, though he promptly sells them. Elena agrees to be a reserve member of the Secret Warriors, but refuses to leave Colombia. She gains the nickname \\"Yo-Yo\\" from Mack. Simmons and Fitz address the distance between them since he destroyed Will's body on Maveth, which she does not blame him for because Will was already dead, and they agree to start over. May consoles Coulson over his decision to murder Ward, telling him that he 'joined the Cavalry'. In an end tag, Ellis informs Coulson that he has appointed Glenn Talbot as the new head of the ATCU.

Early years Myrtle (1916-2011), Midi (1914-1936), and Mary (1912-1991) were the daughters of Nisei Imahei Takaoka (a Christian minister and founder of the Hollywood Japanese Independent Church) and Kazuko Majime. Imahei died young from tuberculosis, leaving the family destitute and their son Hal Takaoka in charge. In their teens Myrtle got into show business as an extra. She convinced her sisters to go into vaudeville as the Taka Sisters, a risqu√© act of the time. Murder of Midi Takaoka The Taka Sisters became nationally recognized but after headlining Harry‚Äôs New York Cabaret between 1935-1936 their careers ended abruptly after Midi Takaoka was murdered in Los Angeles at her family home on August 11, 1936 by Raymond Johnson, a jilted lover. The night before Johnson murdered Takaoka, he had beaten and stabbed William J. Bachand with an ice pick, the other man involved in the love triangle. Police were in pursuit of Johnson when the second crime was committed. Johnson turned himself in to the police two days later and confessed to the murder, saying he slashed her throat in a jealous rage after finding her with another Caucasian man. Bachand had initially met Takaoka at a bus depot in New York, and he proposed marriage to her two days later with an engagement ring he purchased in St. Louis, even though she was already wearing an engagement ring from Johnson. The pair arrived in Los Angeles on August 7, where Takaoka told Johnson she was now involved with Bachand. After Bachand asked Takaoka's mother's permission to marry her, the pair traveled to Yuma to marry, but were denied by the authorities there. After returning to Los Angeles on August 10, Bachand testified that Johnson stabbed him five times with an ice pick that night and told him to leave Takaoka's house, where he was staying. Johnson was separated from Bachand by one of Takaoka's brothers, and Takaoka tearfully threatened to leave both men if they continued to fight. Bachand was taken to the hospital, where he was treated for his wounds, and returned to stay at the Takaoka home later that night. The next morning, on August 11, Johnson returned to confront Takaoka, and according to Bachand's recollection, he witnessed Johnson leaving the house at approximately 9 o'clock, followed by Takaoka, who collapsed on the front lawn. Before a coroner's jury on August 14, Bachand testified that he and Takaoka had tried to marry in California and Arizona, but were denied due to anti-miscegenation laws. At the same inquest, Johnson stated he and Takaoka had been in a relationship for three years, but they could not marry because his estranged wife refused to grant him a divorce. Johnson was indicted on August 20 for the murder of Midi Takaoka and held without bail for trial. During the grand jury hearing, Johnson's confession was read in which he stated he had obtained a butcher knife from his workplace, a restaurant, and sharpened it while praying for strength. After waking Takaoka up in her bedroom the next day, he stated \\"I couldn't control myself any longer. I struck her many times on the head with a cold chisel and then slashed her across the throat with the butcher knife.\\" Johnson was carrying a hatchet in his suitcase when he turned himself into the police, intending \\"to give [it] to Hal Takaoka, the dead girl's brother, so that Hal could cut him into little pieces for murdering his sister.\\" After his trial and conviction, Johnson was sentenced to life in prison for the murder on November 30, 1936, with the possibility of parole after five years. For his assault of Bachand, Johnson was also given a mandatory five-year sentence to be served consecutively. Johnson was later paroled in 1948 after serving twelve years at San Quentin. The murder of Midi Takaoka became widely publicized as a racial cautionary tale, which the Los Angeles Times summarized as a \\"tragic tale of the love of two occidentals for a sloe-eyed oriental dancer\\" and inspired the fate of the character Ida in the novel China Dolls. Wartime years After Executive Order 9066 was issued in 1942, Mary Takaoka was sent to Jerome War Relocation Center while her sister Myrtle and brother Hal spent time in Manzanar. In 1944, V. Vale was born to Mary and Conrad Yama during their internment at Jerome.

The earthquake struck at a depth of around 23 km (14 mi). Its comparatively shallow depth caused more intense reverberations on the surface. The earthquake had a maximum intensity of VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing widespread damage and 116 deaths. Almost all of the deaths were caused by a collapsed residential building, named Weiguan Jinlong in Yongkang District, except two others, whom were killed in Gueiren District. Sixty-eight aftershocks have occurred. The earthquake was the deadliest earthquake in Taiwan since the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. Geology Taiwan is located on the Ring of Fire, making it prone to intense earthquakes. However, the February 2016 event was particularly destructive and deadly. Taiwan lies on the boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate, which are converging at 80 mm per year. The island is the result of uplift caused by the collision between the northern end of the Luzon Arc and the continental margin of China. The earthquake's focal mechanism indicates oblique thrust faulting in the mid to upper crust. The earthquake's epicenter was in the Meinong District in Kaohsiung City. The earthquake waves traveled northwest from the epicenter to Tainan City through the soft soil in the Chianan Plain. Due to the soft soil nature of Tainan, surface ground motion due to the traveling wave was strongly amplified, thus creating more devastating effects in Tainan. Damage The worst affected city was Tainan, where numerous buildings reportedly collapsed, including at least one 17-story residential building in Yongkang District, with hundreds of people trapped in the collapsed buildings. 115 people died inside the Weiguan Jinlong building (zh) in Tainan City, including a six-month-old infant who died a few hours later in a hospital. Officials reported that 397 people were rescued, with 104 of them taken to a hospital. More than 500 people in total were injured from a disaster that struck during the most important family holiday in the Chinese calendar ‚Äî the Lunar New Year holiday. A total of 34 historical buildings around Taiwan were damaged, in which 23 of them are located in Tainan. Public Work Bureau of Kaohsiung City Government discovered 314 broken bridges in the city and 5 of them deemed unusable anymore. Taiwan Power Company initially reported that 168,000 households experienced power outage after the quake, but since then has restored the electricity to most of the houses. National Fire Agency reported that about 400,000 households were left without water supply. Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR) cancelled all train services between Taichung Station and Zuoying Station starting Saturday due to damage to the train power systems and extensive damage to its tracks north of Tainan. Later in the day, THSR made an announcement that the service between Taichung and Chiayi Station resumed after successful repair works. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company reported that the silicon wafers at its Tainan factory were damaged, although it did not affect much of its shipment. United Microelectronics Corporation said that the earthquake triggered its plant safety measures to shut down the machines and that they would need recalibrating afterwards. Disaster response =Rescue efforts= The collapsed 17-story Weiguan Jinlong residential building at in Yongkang District, Tainan. The Ministry of the Interior immediately set up the Central Emergency Operation Center (CEOC) shortly after 4 a.m. once the earthquake had occurred. From the CEOC, President Ma Ying-jeou coordinated the rescue efforts and is expected to head to Tainan. Tainan Mayor William Lai also set up emergency response minutes after the quake. Premier Chang San-cheng has cancelled his original itinerary and is expected to head to Tainan as well. The Ministry of Health and Welfare had launched six regional emergency operation centers. The last survivors, a woman and her niece, were found 60 hours after the earthquake. Ministry of National Defense confirmed that army units were dispatched for the rescue efforts consisting of 810 personnel, 11 medical teams, 24 search and rescue teams and 38 vehicles. The Army Command Headquarters in Gueiren District sent two helicopters to survey the damaged areas. Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital dispatched 30 medical personnel to Tainan. Gen. Yen Teh-fa, Armed Forces Chief of the General Staff, was planned to be stationed at the joint military operations command center to oversee the rescue efforts. A total of 1,200 beds in four locations were prepared by the military for people who lost their homes due to the earthquake. Tainan Air Force Base had been turned into a temporary shelter that could accommodate up to 1,400 people left homeless by the quake. Rescue teams from Japan and People's Republic of China provided advice on the search and rescue efforts. Rescuers used sensors to detect signs of life and avoided using heavy machinery for fear of further collapsing the rubble and potentially trapping any survivors. On 13 February 2016, Tainan Mayor William Lai declared the search and rescue mission for the earthquake victims was over. =Reactions= Hsinhua branch of King's Town Bank Taipei 101 put on a lighting display on Saturday night to pay tribute to the earthquake victims. Tennis athletes Chan Yung-jan and Chan Hao-ching dedicated their Fed Cup Asia/Oceania Group I victory to the earthquake victims. During her visit to Tainan, President-elect Tsai Ing-wen said that safety checks of old buildings and urban renewal will be the top priority of her administration, later stating that Taiwan has become a developed society that demands improved public infrastructure and better quality of life. When meeting with the quake victims treated at hospital, Tsai promised that rescue efforts will continue and that rescue teams will not give up hope. Donations To assist with post-earthquake relief and reconstruction efforts, Japan donated US$1 million, United States pledged US$500,000, and China donated 2 million yuan (approx. USD). Tsai Ing-wen donated NT$1 million to the earthquake relief efforts. New Taipei Mayor Eric Chu also donated NT$1 million to earthquake victims. Changhua County Magistrate Wei Ming-ku donated one month of his salary to the earthquake victims. Yulon Group pledged NT$10 million while Acer donated NT$1 million. Foxconn and Yunglin Healthcare Foundation donated NT$100 million each. Lin Rung San Foundation of Culture and Social Welfare pledged NT$100 million for the victims. Formosa Plastics Corp pledged NT$50 million to help the rescue efforts. Taishin Financial Holdings and Himax each pledged NT$10 million to the Tainan City Government. Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation sent more than 1,000 volunteers to 15 locations in Tainan with blankets, winter bedding, clothes and food for the earthquake survivors. Taiwan's Red Cross Society mobilized more than 100 employees and volunteers to help with the relief efforts, while the Red Cross Society of China and Macau Red Cross have pledged US$303,030 and US$50,000 respectively. In addition, some Taiwanese and foreign celebrities, like Jay Chou or Huang Xiaoming, donated to the relief efforts. Hotels around Tainan provided temporary free rooms for earthquake survivors to stay in. Restaurant owners setup temporary kitchens to provide hot foods for rescue workers and relatives of the people who are still trapped under the building rubble. Heating pads and hand warmers were also distributed to the traffic police around the collapsed building.  Aftermath  = Reconstruction = The government allocated NT$25 billion for the reconstruction after the damaged caused by the earthquake. The government will also provide rent assistance and banks will provide interest-free long- term loans. The government will also release report on land around Taiwan affected by soil liquefaction and submersion. = Criminal investigation = On 9 February 2016, Tainan District Court approved prosecutors' request to detain three executives of a now-defunct Weiguan developer company that built the collapsed Weiguan Jinlong apartment complex. The prosecutors detained Lin Ming-hui (ÊûóÊòéËºù), former chairman of the Weiguan company, as well as two other former executives Chang Kui-an (ÂºµÂ•éÂÆâ) and Cheng Chin-kui (ÈÑ≠ÈÄ≤Ë≤¥), on charges of professional negligence resulting in death. Reuters reported that witnesses saw large rectangular cooking-oil cans packed inside wall cavities of the collapsed apartment building, apparently having been used as building material, while Taiwan media reported the presence of polystyrene in supporting beams, mixed in with concrete.

In Australia, the medical men of the day took a slow approach in the adoption of the new science that involved X-rays. Many of the early demonstrations were made by investigators outside the medical field. Upon examination of the initial investigators, several key factors were common. The individuals had already either been experimenting along similar lines to Wilhelm R√∂ntgen with Crookes tubes and such, the physicists or scientists, or were actively associated with electrical work, the electricians, which made them particularly receptive to the technical appeal of the new science of X-rays. Records of the events reveal that among the medical men who witnessed the first images produced as radiographs, a rather small number had any great desire to employ X-rays directly in their own medical practice.Trainor, J.P. (1946). Salute to the X-Ray Pioneers of Australia. W. Watson & Sons. Sydney, Australia. After the early investigative work of Thomas Ranken Lyle, William Henry Bragg, Joseph Patrick Slattery, and others, almost all medical men were satisfied with soliciting the services of the external X-ray man when necessity arose for skiagraphs to be produced. As the utilization of X-rays became more acceptable, the involvement of electricians began to decline. As the hospitals started to be equipped with X-ray apparatus and installations under the care of radiologists and radiographers, the medical men began to accept the eventuality of the new technology. Up to this point, the private experimenters and investigators continued to be the initiators of new ideas for the medical profession in this new field. Life and times In 1860, Samuel Barbour was born at Leeds, Yorkshire, England the son of William Donald and Mary Hannah Barbour n√©e Clark. His father was born in Scotland, was employed as a manufacturing chemist‚Äôs clerk. His mother was born at Bramley, Yorkshire, England.England and Wales Census, 1871. Database with images.

The family had 5 sons, William J., Arthur J., Samuel, Frederick W. and Charles Ernest, and 4 daughters, Charlotte A., Eleanor, Mary and Margaret.

Barbour emigrated to South Australia and worked as a chemist. He was a pioneer in the development of X-rays in the colony of South Australia. Later he moved to Western Australia and worked as a chemist. He died in 1938 at Leederville, Western Australia. Barbour was buried at Congregational Cemetery in Karrakatta, Western Australia.Editor.

South Australia By February 1888, Barbour was residing at King William-street in Adelaide, South Australia as reported in the local Police Gazette. He had items stolen from his bicycle at his residence, \\"two bicycle keys, a wrench, and an oilcan.\\"Peterswald, W.J. (15 February 1888). Stealing in Dwellings, From the Person, &c.; The South Australian Police Gazette. Page 26. Barbour secured a position as chemist at the pharmaceutical manufacturing firm, F. H. Faulding & Co. He rose to the rank of senior chemist. Eucalyptus oil was a key component in the product line at Faulding and in 1892 Barbour developed a test method to determine the eucalyptol concentration of eucalyptus oil. The Barbour test method became a standard in the industry and in 1893 was listed in the British Pharmacopoeia.Rennie, George E., Editor. (1905). F. H. Faulding & Co.

Sydney.Donovan, Peter. (2001). Luther Robert Scammell. S.A.‚Äôs Greats: The men and women of the North Terrace plaques. Historical Society of South Australia. On 8 January 1895, Barbour presented a paper at a meeting of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia where he proposed standards for eucalyptol concentrations in eucalyptus oil and mentioned the Faulding process. He proposed limits on the specific gravity of eucalyptol and eucalyptus oil.Barbour, S. (1895). Pharmacopoeia Suggestions. Australian Notes. Australasian Journal of Pharmacy.

He visited Leeds, his hometown, where he purchased two Crookes tubes from Reynolds and Branson. In April 1896, Barbour returned to Adelaide. X-ray pioneer The physicist William Henry Bragg had a keen interest in the new discovery of Wilhelm R√∂ntgen. On 29 May 1896 at Adelaide, Bragg demonstrated before a meeting of local doctors the application of \\"X-rays to reveal structures that were otherwise invisible\\". Samuel Barbour, senior chemist from the firm of F. H. Faulding & Co., an Adelaide pharmaceutical manufacturer, supplied the necessary apparatus in the form of a Crookes tube, a glass discharge tube. The tube was obtained at Leeds, England, during Barbour‚Äôs holiday in America and Europe. While at Leeds, he visited the firm of Reynolds and Branson, a manufacturer of photographic and laboratory equipment. Barbour returned to Adelaide in April 1896. The tube was attached to an induction coil and a battery borrowed from Sir Charles Todd, Bragg‚Äôs father-in-law. The induction coil was utilized to produce the electric spark necessary for Bragg and Barbour to \\"generate short bursts of X-rays\\". The audience was favorably impressed.

He studied sculpture under Dr Karel Vogel from 1956 to 1958 at Camberwell School of Art, later known as the Camberwell College of Arts, and briefly at the Royal College of Art in 1958. He moved to Italy in 1983 living near Siena. Career Konstam became an active sculptor and bronze-caster, in parallel forging a career to explore the history of art, specializing in tracing the development of Man's ability to understand what he sees. He lectured on art historical subjects at the major art colleges in the United Kingdom also at Harvard in the US and PINC in the Netherlands. Konstam was commissioned to make portraits of musicians including Otto Klemperer in 1982, Hans Hotter, Manoug Parikian and John Ireland (composer).

Konstam was an artist whose work was displayed in mixed exhibitions, and some solo ones in and around London though, notably, as far back as 1980, presented a major respective in Madrid with over 100 pieces on show followed by shows in Barcelona and Salamanca. He has revealed evidence that some aspects of the history of art are mistaken and challenged orthodoxy on important turning points in art history; namely the classical phase in Greece, the start of the Renaissance and around 1630 which he claims is the start of the modern era.New Humanism by Nigel Konstam 2015 published by Industria Grafica Pistolesi Editrice Il Leccio s.r.l. - Via della Resistenza 117, Localit√† Badesse, Monteriggioni (Siena) One of his theories rejoined the debate about the Elgin Marbles. He argues in his books that the artefacts in the British Museum are Roman copies of the Greek originals. Roughly hewn out of the stone, the Greek would have contrasted sharply with the smoother marble finish made so famous by the London collectors. Artistic analysis A prime focus of Konstam was the exploration of the history of Man's ability to understand what he sees. Many of his relatively revolutionary ideas have been catalogued. Konstam claimed to have established two important contributions to the understanding of western art. The first was outlined in an article in The Apollo Magazine (Aug.1972) describing the geometric method by which a bust of Hadrian was copied into marble, arguing that this three- dimensional geometry was used by many artist, but in his research Konstam did not find evidence of any art historians referring to this technique as the basis for exploring solid and space. Thus Konstam produced evidence of a revised way to think about drawing; accomplished by recognising the two traditions of form making (Greek and Roman) and distinguishing between them. He has stated that a line drawn by Holbein Sculpture the Art and the Practice, Second Edition, LE9 5LN, 2015, p. 146 or Rembrandt is not conceived in the same way as one by Raphael Sculpture the Art and the Practice, Second Edition, LE9 5LN, 2015, p.40 and his followers. Konstam‚Äôs understanding of Rembrandt was based on this different approach: that every mark Rembrandt makes relates to a position in space. Konstam noted this is the secret of Rembrandt‚Äôs success in capturing the spirit of the individual in his drawings and has stated that Rembrandt is the most transparent artist of whom he has researched. Konstam also noted his concern that The British Museum had altered a particular bust stating that \\"he was shocked to see that the ear lobes of Hadrian (room 70) had been ‚Äòrestored‚Äô. ‚Ä¶ thus they have repaired the chips in both of Hadrian‚Äôs ears which constitutes the clearest demonstration of my thesis: that three dimensional geometry was used and loved by the Romans and many great artists since (Rembrandt owned 30 Roman portraits and filled two books with drawings of them)‚Äù Konstam‚Äôs second contention was his discovery that ancient Greek sculpture was based on Life-casting, from approx 500BC onwards. This he has noted ‚Äúcould be regarded as shocking because it alters the foundations of art history as taught today e.g. Heinrich W√∂lfflin, Principles of Art History. The assumption has previously been that the Greeks arrived at their \\"Classical\\" phase by a leap of the imagination. Konstam has said ‚Äúthis version has less romantic appeal but is claimed to be the truth. He has documented that Lifecasting is why Greek stone sculptures show traces of being measured, but no explanation of what they were measured from. Life- casting explains why no sculptor since the Greeks has ever equaled their quality in terms of modeling veins or other small details of anatomy‚Äù. Rembrandt controversy Konstam Maquette mirror-image comparison to Rembrandt's Four Musicians with Instruments Konstam's article, \\"Rembrandt's Use of Models and Mirrors\\" was published in The Burlington Magazine February 1977 with the backing of Prof. Sir Ernst Gombrich. Benedict Nicolson, editor The Burlington, wrote in response \\"I find the evidence you have accumulated of the greatest possible interest, and so I am sure will Rembrandt scholars, who must now get down to revising the corpus of drawings!\\". Lawrence Gowing, from The Slade School of Fine Art at the time also wrote in support, noting ‚ÄúYour view of the division between objective and imaginative seems to me, artistically and psychologically, much more comprehensible and satisfactory than anything before.‚Äù A similar article appeared in Rembrandthuiskroniek 1978. Max Wykes-Joyce, in The International Herald Tribune, wrote, on 27 January 1976, of Konstam‚Äôs exhibition running at the Consort Gallery Imperial College to 13 February 1976 \\"... which, by implication, contradicts much of the 20th-century criticism and scholarship. As a working artist, the case he makes for the redating and reconsideration of many of Rembrandt's drawings is strong ... But certainly the exhibition is a seminal one which should not be lightly dismissed\\". Prof. Bryan Coles, Professor of Liberal Studies at Imperial College wrote ‚Äúthese reconstructions (many of which compel assent) ... it would be a pity for scholarship not to profit from his (Konstam‚Äôs) imaginative researches‚Äù. Rembrandt was the first artist Konstam discovered to be using mirrors and similar usage by Diego Vel√°zquez, Johannes Vermeer and Filippo Brunelleschi soon followed. The Konstam Maquette of Musicians comparative image is posited as solid evidence that Rembrandt used models and a mirror in the construction of his drawing of Four Musicians with Wind Instruments. The nearest flautist holds the flute the wrong way round and the oboist's hands are shown too close to the mouthpiece. This would not have occurred if the subject was drawn from true musicians. The second flautist has his instrument the right way round, proving the mirror reversal. Konstam has discovered 80 instances of this method of doubling the subject matter in Rembrandt's drawings. The Adoration of the Shepherds is the one instance where Konstam has found Rembrandt making two paintings, one from a mirror image and the other from life direct but both observed from the same position. Thus geometry is part of the proof. Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn: The Old Man Sitting in a Chair By 1974 Konstam was contending he had proved the case that Rembrandt observed reality and reflections etc. to help create his masterpieces rather than using his imagination, the scholars' view, as noted in his eBook. Konstam wrote to the Rembrandt Research Project on two occasions vigorously requesting they reattributed ‚ÄúThe Old Man Sitting in a Chair‚Äù to Rembrandt. His view was dismissed at the time by the Rembrandt Research Project. However, the project was terminated by the Rembrandt Research Project Board in 2011 and in 2014 Professor Ernst van de Wetering, once chairman of the Rembrandt Research Project an accepted 'authority', or in terms of connoisseurship, on Rembrandt, gave his opinion in an article in The Guardian that the demotion of the 1652 painting of the Old Man Sitting in a Chair \\"was a vast mistake...it is a most important painting. The painting needs to be seen in terms of Rembrandt's experimentation‚Äù. Not only is Van de Wetering convinced that Old Man in an Armchair is a genuine Rembrandt, but also that it is a pivotal work. ‚ÄúIt is of wonderful quality and is revolutionary in a sense.‚Äù An earlier study ran counter to the view of Professor Ernst van de Wetering. Moreover, in 2014 the National Gallery reattributed the painting \\"to an unknown contemporary follower of Rembrandt, probably working in the 1650s\\", but sometime later circa 2016 the picture was re-labelled ‚ÄúProbably by Rembrandt‚Äù noting \\"it is not a portrait but a character study, a type of painting that lends itself to experimentation far more than a formal portrait would. It has been convincingly proposed that as such it in fact represents an important experimental step in Rembrandt‚Äôs development towards the rough manner of his later works.\\" In 2009 Konstam provided a demonstration of the London version of The Adoration of the Shepherds (also deattributed by the Rembrandt Research Project), noting that ‚Äúit has to originate from a complex three dimensional group seen through a mirror‚Äù, the very group accepted as a Rembrandt in Munich. The National Gallery (London) subsequently reviewed their previous judgment and replaced the version they held, The Adoration of the Shepherds, among their Rembrandts, (see register 15 October. 2014‚Äì18 January 2015 ). It had previously been languishing in the basement since the Rembrandt Research Project had insisted it was a 17th-century variant of a version in Munich. Alternative approaches Other contributors to the debate of techniques used by artists included on 8 March 2012 Tim's Vermeer, documentary film \\"Jan Vermeer and the Camera Obscura\\" which made the claim that a newly invented instrument, probably unknown to Vermeer1632 ‚Äì 1675 in the Music Lesson 1664, thus disproving conclusively the previously thought idea that he used the camera obscura technique in this and other work. On 14 March 2014, David Hockney presented a BBC Documentary, Secret Knowledge - Part One featuring Phillip Steadman‚Äôs book Vermeer‚Äôs Camera. Konstam disputed this in his third film on Vermeer, pointing out that Johan Vermeer died in debt had a large family and would have needed a very large studio (over 6m in length) whereas Konstam's explanation needs only a small studio of just over 3 m. Furthermore, the image from a 17th-century camera is impractically small and weak. Konstam also noted the strange way of viewing Filippo Brunelleschi's first experiment in perspective, which he claimed was easily explained following Manetti's description precisely. Later developments Konstam has offered a summary of his contention in the Journal of Information Ethics published by McFarland Books in 2015.. His assertion is that 'Rembrandt specialists' have subconsciously determined to convert the artist to 20/21st Century mores or contemporary beliefs; the preference for imagination over observation whereas Rembrandt's contemporaries all insisted \\"he observed, anything else was worthless in his eyes\\". Konstam noted that Rembrandt was very much a part of his time, \\"born into the middle of the revolution in science which started with Copernicus and Galileo; a revolution based on the rejection of the hypothetical philosophy inherited from the Greeks, Aristotle in particular, and relied instead on careful observation, measurement and logical deduction from the data.\\" He has argued that Rembrandt embodies the same spirit in art, insisting that direct observation was the mainstay of Rembrandt‚Äôs achievement and that contemporary understanding of the nature of the visual imagination is misguided. Konstam has espoused his theory in a YouTube film.

The film was produced by Raymond Spottiswoode and directed by Jane Marsh.Keshen 2004, p. 156. The film's French version title is Les Femmes dans la m√™l√©e.  Synopsis  In 1942, during the Second World War, as demands on the Canadian military grow, women are taking an increasingly important place alongside men. Not only in Canada were the strengths and talents of women being harnessed in a \\"total war\\" that had reached global proportions. In Great Britain when the war began, military authorities soon realized the importance of mobilizing all their citizens. Entering the industrial workforce, women supplemented men in many positions at munitions factories. Through the civilian Women's Volunteer Service women became nurses, ambulance drivers and Air Raid Wardens. Following in the wake of the volunteer organizations were the specialized Women's Auxiliary, dedicated to freeing men for other military service. The Women's Auxiliaries included the women in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) with women as orderlies, drivers, postal workers, ammunition inspectors and operating searchlight units. The women pilots in the RAF Ferry Command took on the important but dangerous role of ferrying aircraft from factories or repair depots to the front line Royal Air Force operational units. In the Soviet Union, the strength of one hundred million women is being seen in many ways. Women have taken on great responsibilities from running the collective farms, working in industrial production, and serving in the military units on the front lines. In the Soviet Supreme Council, 227 women deputies also were elected. Canada also saw women becoming involved in the war effort. As Canadian men are being mobilized to serve in the military, three million women are also mobilized to serve in the \\"home front\\". The largest contribution by Canadian women was through unpaid volunteer work, participating in recycling programs, creating Red Cross packages, hosting dances for servicemen and other related domestic activities. The other important role that women took on was at munitions factories, turning out the tools of war. Canadian women also served in the military with the Canadian Women's Army Corps taking over 21 types of army duties, enabling men to be released for combat service. The Canadian Nursing Sisters have gone overseas. In the Woman's Division in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) women became clerks, drivers, photographers, air photo interpreters, weather observers, instrument mechanics, parachute riggers as well as many administrative and technical positions in the RCAF. Most women served at British Commonwealth Air Training Plan stations across Canada. Canadian women will also play a part after the war, in building a new world.

Each film was shown over a six-month period as part of the shorts or newsreel segments in approximately 800 theatres across Canada. The NFB had an arrangement with Famous Players theatres to ensure that Canadians from coast- to-coast could see them, with further distribution by Columbia Pictures.Ellis and McLane 2005, p. 122. After the six-month theatrical tour ended, individual films were made available on 16 mm to schools, libraries, churches and factories, extending the life of these films for another year or two. They were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities. A total of 199 films were produced before the series was canceled in 1959.Ohayon, Albert. \\"Propaganda cinema at the NFB\\". National Film Board of Canada, July 13, 2009. Retrieved: February 5, 2016. Historian Malek Khouri analyzed the role of the NFB wartime documentaries with Women Are Warriors characterized as an example of a propaganda film. \\"During the early years of the NFB, its creative output was largely informed by the turbulent political and social climate the world was facing. World War II, Communism, unemployment, the role of labour unions, and working conditions were all subjects featured by the NFB during the period from 1939 to 1946\\".Khouri 2007, back cover. The role of women depicted in Women Are Warriors also showed an acceptance of a new role to come in postwar years.Ramsay 2011, p. 40. In an examination of the role of the NFB in wartime, historian George Evans observed: \\"If contemporary feminists sense omissions and patronizing in the film, one must at least acknowledge that [Women Are Warriors] expressed a positive attitude to working women and was conditioning audiences to become accustomed to new and permanent women's roles in the workplace.\\"Evans 1984, p. 185. He further noted: \\"The film ['Women Are Warriors'] ended with a superb montage moving from shots of women in factories to a plane in action, to factory, to plane to factory and plane to demonstrate how important women's roles were to the war effort.\\"Evans 1984, p. 138. Film Historian Barbara Halpern Martineau considered the significance of Women Are Warriors in a historical context. \\"Unlike 'Women at War' and 'Wings on Her Shoulders', 'Women Are Warriors' makes it clear that these women were not leisurely idlers before the war - they were domestic workers, secretaries, doing whatever work was available for women. But just as the implications of Jane Marsh's original title, 'Work for Women', were suppressed in favour of 'Women Are Warriors', so the implications of the film's structure and commentary are suppressed by the use of a male narrator - the same patriotic, reassuring voice heard in so many films showing men at war.\\"Feldman and Nelson 1977, p. 65.

History  The land where Rubonia was laid out was part of an 80-acre plot that Albert Stonelake, a United States Union Army surgeon, purchased in 1868. Stonelake sold the undeveloped land to Marcus DeVoursney in 1881. DeVoursney died in 1904 and his estate sold the land in 1911 to William and Nellie Smith, who platted the area in 1913 with plans to develop it as a neighborhood known as East Terra Ceia. The area was planned as housing for African Americans working in the area as migrant farmers. Within a few years, Atlantic Coast Line Railroad officials requested that East Terra Ceia‚Äôs name be changed due to frequent mix-ups between it and adjacent Terra Ceia. William Smith renamed the area based on a list of available names provided by the railroad company. Although unconfirmed, Rube Allyn, Sarasota Sun newspaperman and humorist, claimed to be the source of the name Rubonia. Allyn claimed that his friend, Charles R. Capp, vice-president of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, selected the name in his honor. This story does not mesh with most tellings of the story, which attribute the name to the other rail company operating at Rubonia, Atlantic Coast, and may just be another example of Allyn's humorous tales. Although the community was planned as a segregated neighborhood, the 1920 census for Rubonia shows that the neighborhood was racially mixed, with some white families also living in the community. The community has remained small throughout the decades and most residents worked in the agricultural and manufacturing industries. Rubonia‚Äôs development suffered due to the construction of U.S. 41 in 1965, which bypassed the small town on the main route between Tampa and Bradenton. The community gained some attention in 1973 when it served as the filming location of the movie Ride in a Pink Car which starred Glenn Corbett. However, much of that attention was negative, as the themes of the movie and subsequent press blurred with the realities of life in Rubonia. Newspaper coverage described Rubonia as a nearly lawless wild west divided by ethnic lines and a hotbed of crime and violence.  Rubonia Mardi Gras  Rubonia hosts one of the only Mardi Gras parades in the area, known as the Historical Rubonia & Terra Ceria Mardi Gras. The event dates back to 1980 when Luanne Topp (aka Ruby Rubonia) wanted to go to the New Orleans Mardi Gras to celebrate her birthday. She couldn't manage to put the trip together, so to cheer her up, about a dozen friends jumped on a truck and threw their own parade through the town. The event was so popular among community members that it began being held annually and at its peak had an attendance of over 20000 spectators. In 2015, the event was cancelled due to financial troubles but in 2017 it was revived by the D.L. Randall Foundation, who continue to fund and host the event each year.

Early life Mabel Ridley was born in Augusta, Georgia, to Charles and Katherine Ridley around 1895. Her family were African-American Catholics who had been in the area for several generations. Back in 1843, on the occasion of their marriage, Mabel Ridley's grandparents Ulysses Ridley and Antoinette (Dugas) Ridley had been recorded as free people of color. Ridley had two sisters, Julia and Antoinette. Ridley later said that her first language was Gullah and her second English. It appears that Ridley may have been married to a man surnamed Edwards. Career as performer Mabel Ridley was educated at Augusta's Haines Institute, which was founded by African-American educator Lucy Craft Laney. The school nurtured her musical abilities, and after she left she moved to New York. Early on, Ridley appeared in several productions by the Tutt Brothers, including a touring musical, Non-Sense (1925), and two touring revues, Rainbow Chasers (1925) and Everybody's Talking (1925). Also in 1926, she appeared in the musical revue Desires of 1927, which was cowritten by Andy Razaf. In 1927, she appeared in the touring vaudeville revue Miss Bandanna, by Clarence Muse and starring Moms Mabley. In 1929, she appeared on Broadway in another Tutt Brothers production, the musical comedy Deep Harlem, which took as its subject black history in America from slavery through the 1920s. It featured music by Joe Jordan, and Ridley played several roles in the show, including Princess Ola. Underfunded, it closed quickly, and Ridley shortly thereafter joined a revue, Ebony Show Boat, that opened in Harlem, toured to Philadelphia, and then returned to New York. A year later, Ridley performed in the first run of Marc Connelly's Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning drama The Green Pastures. That same year, she performed with the Heaven Gate Singers in Scarlet Sister Mary, a play based on a Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning novel of the same name by South Carolina author Julia Peterkin and starring Ethel Barrymore in blackface. The last role Ridley is known to have performed was Clara in a Charleston, South Carolina, production of George Gershwin's opera Porgy and Bess. Ridley died in April 1938; an obituary printed on April 23 stated that she had died several days earlier in New York.

The film features a cameo by the director's sister Anna Paquin and her husband Stephen Moyer. Plot The film begins as real estate agent Carl (Gabriel Olds) hosts an open house. As Carl finishes with the last couple viewing the house, a man arrives and watches Carl briefly before hiding in the basement. Carl checks the basement but does not see anyone. Alice (Rachel Blanchard) returns home after a run. Carl reveals that it has been tough to interest buyers in the house. That night, Alice has some friends over for dinner, including Jennie (Anna Paquin). Alice confides in Jennie that her ex-husband Josh (Stephen Moyer) thinks she is being overemotional by selling their house. Alice falls asleep and wakes up in the middle of the night. She notices that Jennie's car is in the driveway. So, Alice looks for Jennie in the house, only to find her corpse in the garage with her throat slashed. As she screams, someone emerges from a crawlspace behind Alice and grabs her. The next day, Lila (Tricia Helfer) arrives at the house and is greeted by David (Brian Geraghty), who has chained Alice into the crawlspace. Lila approves of their new house, and announces that it is now home. David sets up a video camera in an upstairs window as Lila relaxes in the hot tub. Josh arrives at the house to retrieve his golf clubs and is surprised to find Lila in the hot tub. She explains that she is housesitting and seduces Josh. David films their encounter, and when Lila is ready to climax, he retrieves a kitchen knife. David gives the knife to Lila, and she stabs Josh in the neck, leaving David to clean up the body. During the day, Lila disappears, while David maintains the house. He lets Alice out of the crawlspace to eat and use the bathroom. Eventually, he warns Alice that Lila would kill her if she knew that Alice was still alive. David lets Alice sit with him while he works at his computer, but he is always careful to stash her back in the crawlspace before Lila gets home. One day, when a pair of housecleaners arrive unexpectedly, David kills them. Lila and David host a dinner party with two couples. During the dinner party, Lila reveals that David is writing a children's story. As she describes the plot of the story, it becomes clear that she and David are twins. After one couple leaves, Lila seduces the woman in the second couple. As the man joins the two of them in a m√©nage √† trois, David sets up the video camera. He gets a kitchen knife and goes into the bedroom, where the couple start screaming. During their days together, Alice grows more and more convinced that David is an unwilling partner in his murderous relationship with Lila. She convinces David that they can run away together. Meanwhile, she secretly grabs a small kitchen knife and takes it with her to the crawlspace. One day, Lila pretends to be a potential buyer of the house and lets Carl take her on a tour. In the bedroom, she tries to seduce Carl, but he hears David hiding in the bathroom. She quickly slashes his throat and orders David to clean up the body before the blood soaks through the floor to the ceiling in the living room. David tells Lila that all the bodies they have accumulated are starting to rot and that they will have to leave the house soon. As they prepare to leave, David packs a suitcase filled with his belongings and some clothes for Alice. When Lila discovers the suitcase, she marches to the garage and checks all the coolers where David has stored the bodies, looking for Alice. Not seeing her corpse, Lila looks for Alice. When she puts her eye up to a hole in the crawlspace door, Alice stabs Lila with her knife. The two struggle, but the Alice overpower the severely wounded Lila. When one of Alice's friends arrives at the house to check on her, he sees the blood from Lila's wounds and discovers the panicked Alice in chains. He tries to cut through her chains with a hacksaw. When he goes upstairs to call 911, David kills him. David rushes downstairs to find Alice holding her knife to Lila's neck. She threatens to kill Lila unless David releases her. Instead, David offers to assist Alice with slashing Lila's neck, believing it to be the only way that he will be able to leave with Alice alongside him. Lila, however, then manages to stab Alice in the chest as both she and David are forced to flee whilst Alice lies wounded, but still clinging to life, on the floor. The film finally closes as Lila tours yet another new house before declaring to the realtor that it already feels like home.

It is based on a system of peer support and monitoring. Membership of IPN is open to groups of practitioners. Individuals who have not yet joined a group are ‚Äòparticipants‚Äô. They can be involved in the activities of IPN, but may not describe themselves as ‚Äòmembers of IPN‚Äô. Groups become members of the IPN by: :(a) having at least four IPN participants :(b) publishing a group code of ethics and :(c) linking to at least two other groups of IPN participants. Practitioners may include counsellors, psychotherapists, teachers/educators, bodyworkers and others who work in a relational way with the clientele. IPN supports and encourages diversity, and so a group will typically encompass a number of different practices. Members of a group support, monitor and constructively challenge each other‚Äôs practice. They may do this in a variety of ways, providing sufficient challenge to enable them to \\"stand by\\" each practitioner in their group. The process by which this is accomplished is monitored in turn by each of the link groups. Each member group and its two link groups may not form a closed triangle. IPN offers a form of accreditation which differs from other institutional accrediting bodies, in that it does not monitor training organisations, but rather examines current practice and is founded in ongoing and regular face-to-face engagement with peers in a non-hierarchical framework. Individuals can describe themselves as being ‚Äòaccredited through the IPN process‚Äô. Some practitioners may be members of other accrediting bodies, using the IPN process to ensure and maintain best practice. Further reading * Campbell, S. and Grace, J.

The farmhouse was built in 1730 in an area known as ƒ¶al Muselmiet, during the rule of the Order of St. John. According to the Naxxar Local Council, the building is the oldest farmhouse in the area of its type. The farmhouse has a vernacular structure with traditional Maltese architecture. The farmhouse was used for agricultural purposes but it is now a residential building. Location Ta' Cisju Farmhouse is found in an area known as ƒ¶al Muselmiet. The area was named during the Arab period in Malta, which literally means 'Village of the Muslims'.Maltahomes Ltd (2015), \\"Naxxar, Malta\\", Holidays Lets Malta Gozo. The farmhouse has no direct connection with the Arab period but the farmlands of the area, which were developed during the Arabs, have a direct connection as the farmhouse is an agricultural building. It is located right on the side of a main road in Naxxar that lead to San Pawl tat-Targa. The farmhouse is found in the same area of the Hompesch Hunting Lodge of which both have the same public garden in front of them. Not far from the farmhouse are found the Gauci Tower and the Captain's Tower which were built before the farmhouse. When the farmhouse was built it was surrounded by farmlands but most of the area is urban today. Some fields still exist close to the building. The farmhouse has become a corner building as roads were constructed next to it.Spiteri, Stephen C, \\"Naxxar and its fortifications\\" , Military Architecture.Naxxar Local Council (2013), \\"Towards San Pawl tat-Targa\\", Walks to discover a Village.\\"Naxxar, four walks to discover a village\\", Din l-Art Helwa, p. 31. History Since the Arab period the area was a fertile ground and many fields are found until day. The area became a village during the Arab rule of which only the rural characteristics remain to be most evident of this. The area use to receive surprise attacks from sea corsairs, and for this reason it was unpopular among locals to settle in the area. Even though in the area there are the Gauci Tower (built by Francesco Gauci in 1548) and the Knights built the Captain's Tower to further enhance the protection of the farming community, both of them served of a lesser service to the farmhouse when it was built. This is because in the late 17th century the Order of St. John built the Wignacourt towers, the Lascaris towers and the De Redin towers. The towers served the community, including the Ta' Cisju Farmhouse, as a better defense and thus allowing the prosperity of the village. The Ta' Cisju Farmhouse is now set in a corner The farmlands have a direct association with the building of the farmhouse as it served as a rural building for the farmer, or farmers, who cultivated the lands in the area. The lands offered fertile grounds for the few families who lived there in the 18th-century. It is possibly one of the first structures of its type to be built in the said area, and remains to be known as the 'oldest farmhouse' in Naxxar. It is believed that the farmhouse was built in 1730. This date is indicated with it being written on the facade close to a window on the first floor. Naxxar started to develop into a village as it is known today during the British period as during the knights it was mostly an agricultural area and a hunting zone. During the British the farmhouse became a residential house and complete with electricity. Some rooms were evidently added to the back of the farmhouse. probably to make it a comfortable residence, but significantly the original building was maintained and restored sometimes in the early 21st-century. The farmhouse is now named as Ta' Cisju; this name has no historical connection and consequently it is not found in any literature until the start of the 21st-century. Architecture Ta' Cisju Farmhouse is in a good state of preservation Ta' Cisju Farmhouse is a good example of Maltese traditional agricultural building. It takes in the form of modest vernacular architecture. It was built to serve for agricultural needs in 1730, with some possible influence of building of the order of St. John, but its description shows it is largely traditional. Some rooms were added in recent years (post-2000) at the back of the building with similar characteristics. A large window was opened at the lower floor, which consequentially removed some 18th-century stonework. This can be noticed from the photos taken before and after the rehabilitation and conversion of the property. Today the farmhouse is a residential home and has modern facilities. The farmhouse was restored sometimes in the early 21st-century and is in a good state of preservation. The farmhouse has typical traditional characteristic similar to other farmhouses in Naxxar, such as; a wide arched doorway (remissa), small window at the first floor (the first floor is traditionally known as Gƒßorfa), waterspouts on the exterior, limestone slabs and other.

Origins The original Gilgarran Branch was authorised by Act of Parliament on 2 August 1875 to run from a junction near westwards to Gilgarran No 2 Colliery. Extensions were authorised on 27 June 1876, before the original branch opened, to what would become and down the valley of the Lowca Beck to the coast at . The line as a whole became known as the Gilgarran Branch. The line was proposed by the Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway (WCER), but by the time it opened in 1879 the company had been bought out by the LNW and Furness Railways who operated its routes as the \\"LNWR & FR Joint Railway\\", known locally as \\"The Joint Lines\\". The WCER was commercially successful, paying a significant dividend throughout its existence, but arguably it overplayed its hand, increasing its rates on its near-monopolistic core mineral traffic in the 1870s so much that local Ironmasters decided to dig deep in their pockets and create a new competitor, in the form of the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway. The Gilgarran Branch was one of a series of defensive measures aimed to stymie the new company. Construction and connections The branch was built westwards from the Joint Line's to line at Ullock Junction , a remote, upland spot with no road access. This first , gently graded section as far as opened in 1879 and served Wythemoor Colliery and the then recently opened Distington Ironworks. At Distington the branch both met and crossed the rival CWJR's main line which also opened in 1879. The layout resulted in Distington station having five platform faces, which would turn out to be an immense overprovision. The branch's second stage curved sharply southwestwards immediately north of the station, following Lowca Beck for downhill at an average gradient of 1 in 53 until it joined the goods lines near on the Cumbrian Coast Line. This section opened in 1881 and included at a junction known as \\"Bain's Siding\\" with a mineral line to Harrington No 10 Colliery on the clifftops at Lowca, in effect making a junction with the Lowca Light Railway. Passenger services No passenger service ever operated on Sundays on any part of the branch. No passenger service ever operated on the Ullock Junction to Distington section. Public passenger services were provided over two periods between Distington and , using the branch northeastwards from Parton. Two trains a day ran in both directions from this section's opening in 1881, but they were withdrawn in 1883 through lack of custom. The service was reinstated from autumn 1913 (sources disagree whether from October or from November), running on Thursdays (one round trip) and Saturdays (two round trips) only, being withdrawn again at the end of August 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War. Demand for services to a station serving Lowca from Whitehaven was remedied from 11 January 1915 by opening near the foot of the branch, from which workers could climb a steep track to their workplaces. A three-times-a-day, unadvertised, workmen's service was provided until buses provided a more attractive service by 1929, when it was withdrawn. A second workmen's halt was provided on the western section of the branch around the time of the Second World War, known as . Research continues on details of location, dates and services. Freight services As with almost all railways in the area, the dominant traffic was freight in general and minerals in particular. In this regard parts of the Gilgarron Branch were first and last out. The branch's first customer was Wythemoor Colliery, east of Distington. It closed in 1886, a mere seven years after the branch opened, due to \\"incompetent management\\". The colliery reopened in 1904 and wound coal until the 1920s, but the branch eastwards to Ullock Junction from the junction with the colliery siding closed in 1919, all coal heading westwards thereafter. The second customer was Distington Ironworks which ceased production in 1922, overtaken by technological progress in steelmaking. In 1888, for example, just one train a day ran out and back from Ullock Junction to Distington Ironworks, one train a day ran out and back from Parton to Bain's Siding and one train a day ran out and back from the coast to Distington Ironworks, meagre fare for the investment in infrastructure. Perhaps worse, commercially, was that the bulk of traffic to and from Distington Ironworks travelled on the rival CWJR, with only a meagre amount of pig iron travelling down the western part of the branch through Parton to Whitehaven. The First World War brought extra demand for iron, steel and coal and threw the branch a lifeline. The April 1917 Working Time Table shows three Up mineral trains travelling the first eastwards from Parton Junction to Workington Iron & Steel Co's No 4 Pit and two travelling beyond to Distington Ironworks, with an extra on Saturdays, all matched by Down trains. The line eastwards from Distington Ironworks closed after Wythemoor Pit closed, followed on 2 May 1932 by the section from Distington to Bain's Siding. This left two sections of the branch with rails in place: * Distington Junction to the site of Distington Ironworks, used only in part as a siding, and * Parton to Bain's Siding. The former was to gain an unexpected and as yet undocumented railway life during the Second World War when the High Duty Alloys company was established on the ironworks site, making a wide range of materials, including Hiduminium for war use, such as in aircraft parts. After the war, however, the rail traffic generated for the branch or the CWJR main line was described by an ex-employee as \\"negligible\\". In the early 1960s occasional scrap wagons were loaded at the former Gilgarran Branch Down platform which was being used as a scrapyard by Hanratty's of Workington. All tracks at Distington were finally closed on 26 September 1965 and subsequently lifted. The most westerly end of the branch, from Parton to Bain's Siding led a charmed life, outliving not only the rest of the branch but almost all other Joint Lines' and CWJR lines. It survived until May 1973 as it was used to deliver coal from Solway Colliery, Workington, to the washery and bi-product plants at Lowca, the remains of the Lowca Light Railway (LLR) along the clifftops being used to take the finished products away northwards to Moss Bay. The coal was worked southwards from Solway to Parton sidings along the coast line then reversed up the remains of the Gilgarran Branch, past the site of Parton Halt, to Bain's Siding. The points were reset and the train pulled forward up the valley side to Lowca. This zig-zag met the need to climb from sea level which the LLR achieved by extreme gradients. Lowca's most widely renowned concern - the locomotive manufacturer Lowca Engineering - stood in the Vee between the coast line and the Gilgarran Branch, but mentions of rail traffic to the site are very elusive. Special trains Two enthusiasts' special trains composed of guards vans were run over the zig-zag downhill from Lowca to Parton, having been hauled up to the clifftop via the Lowca Light Railway route through with its famous 1 in 17 incline. The first ran on 2 March 1968, followed on 26 May 1969 by the \\"Furnessman\\", which enjoyed steam banking up Copperas Hill and steam haulage down to Parton from Lowca. Afterlife By 1981 just a stub remained near the site of Parton Halt, but this had been swept away with the other Civil Engineers sidings at Parton by 2013. The general line of the branch southwest of Distington has been used for improvements to the A595, though the exact course is only followed in part. East of Distington fragments can be discerned, but most has been returned to agricultural use.

Along with her sister ship Union Rotorua, she was unusual in that she originally had turbo-electric transmission. Construction Union Rotoiti was built by Broken Hill Pty (BHP) at the Whyalla Steelworks in South Australia. She was completed on 22 June 1977. Delivery was delayed by a year and costs went over budget by $8 million dollars bringing the total cost to $30 million dollars. It was subsequently acknowledged that Rotoiti and her sister ship Rotorua could have been built for half the price if they had been built outside Australia. Union Rotoiti was unusual in that she was powered by gas turbine. The ship's main gas turbine / electric machinery consisted of a single General Electric MM5262RB gas turbine operating on a regenerative cycle. This was coupled to an AC generator to provide a maximum designed continuous rating of 18822 kW for a motor propeller speed of 200 rpm. The turbine speed of 4670 rpm was reduced to 1500 rpm for the generator by a reduction gearbox. The generator output 6.6 kV 3-phase at 50 Hz to the ships motors. There were four closed air circuit water cooled synchronous AC motors, arranged with two per shaft. Previous USSCo vessels had traditionally had twin outward turning fixed pitch propellers, however Union Rotoiti has twin inward turning controllable pitch propellers. This decision was made in the interests of manoeuvrability, since the center of thrust is in the outer part of the disk thus giving a larger turning moment arm. In normal running configuration the whole system could be controlled by a single lever from the bridge. The speed of the gas turbine was controlled by a solid state control and safety system integrated with the propulsion controls. Because of high fuel use it was subsequently converted to diesel power at Newcastle NSW in 1986. Union Rotoiti was also interesting in its use of ro-ro for the Trans Tasman route. The cargo did not necessarily just contain truck and trailer units, but also had cargo stacked in the decks using forklifts. This necessitated the vehicle decks of the ship being build to withstand the loading of up to 39 t per axle that could be exerted by a heavy forklift. Union Rotoiti was built with a large angled stern ramp that allowed her to unload her cargo at any wharf without the need for a specialist linkspan as required by most ro-ro ships. She also had a bow door which could be used if a linkspan was present in a port, thus allowing cargo to be worked both forward and aft speeding up turn around time. Incidents In May 1980 Union Rotorua was on passage from Tauranga to Sydney when she broke down 200 miles west of Cape Maria van Diemen. Union Rotoiti was only 80 miles away and the two masters agreed to attempt a tow. Captain Andrew Keyworth, one of the most senior masters of the USSCo, was the master of Union Rotoiti. With much skill on his part, and while the ships were sometimes only 25 metres apart, a line was made fast between the two ships by use of a line- carrying rocket. Once the tow began 422 nm were covered in just over 56 hours at an average speed of 7.5 knots. It was a feat never before accomplished with two ships of this size, and Captain John Warren of the Union Rotorua later exclaimed: ‚ÄòIf anyone had previously tried to tell me it was possible ‚Ä¶ I would have thought them quite barmy‚Äô. On 23 April 1999, New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation committee reported Union Rotoiti as losing power in the Tasman Sea.

The game follows an unstoppable bus with which the player must accomplish missions or defeat other players in head-to-head combat. It was released on May 26, 2016, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux.  Gameplay  In OmniBus, the player controls an unstoppable bus with which the player is able to break through most in-game objects, unless the bus lands on its roof or falls off the map. The player's bus is unable to stop or slow down; rather, its speed increases over time. OmniBus gives the player the choice between free-play and single-player mode. In the latter, the player is given a specific instruction to accomplish using the bus, such as robbing a bank or safely carrying passengers. In addition, OmniBus features local multiplayer for up to four players in head-to-head deathmatch mode.  Development  OmniBus art style is similar to classic PlayStation games' low-poly 3D design, and its unstoppable bus has been compared to the plot of the 1994 film Speed. Development on the game began in summer 2014, when DePaul University students Amir Badri and Jeremy Crockett decided to make a physics-based game about a bus; however, the development was halted for almost a year. After development resumed, the team released a playable demo of OmniBus to itch.io and launched a Kickstarter campaign. During the campaign, it was announced the game would be shown at indie game festival Bit Bash in Chicago, Illinois, on August 22, 2015. On January 14, 2016, publisher Devolver Digital released a trailer titled \\"The Story of OmniBus\\", which depicted the game as a lost and repeatedly canceled title from the 1990s, finally releasing in 2016 after over 20 years of being vaporware. The video also served to announce that Devolver would be publishing OmniBus. It was then announced that it would be released in Spring 2016 on Steam. OmniBus was brought to PAX South 2016 in San Antonio, Texas, in January 2016. On May 19, 2016, it was announced that OmniBus would be released on May 26, 2016. The game was released in three editions: the Free Edition, consisting of printable papercraft models of game objects; the Game of the Year Edition, including the game itself and its soundtrack; and the Ultimate Bus Driver Edition, a one-off $7,500 package including the Game of the Year Edition and a 1977 MCI charter bus, which would have to be picked up in Austin, Texas. Reception OmniBus received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Jed Whitaker at Game Revolution noted that the game physics, though intentionally unsound for the sake of satire, had a detrimental effect on the experience. The soundtrack was said to be one of the worst he had ever heard, while the free play mode was described to have been a useless addition to \\"an overall shallow game\\". However, Whitaker singled out the multiplayer mode as OmniBus only redeeming quality, alongside a few of the story levels. Writing for Hardcore Gamer, Kyle LeClair praised the execution of it deliberately being \\"so bad, it's good\\". Like Whitaker, LeClair found the story levels enjoyable, and despite its flawed physics, thought the gameplay was rewarding and challenging. LeClair observed that the music and free play mode lacked variety, but were otherwise entertaining.

Early life and career  Assiri was born in 1980 in Asir Province, a region in south-west Saudi Arabia. He joined the Royal Saudi Air Force when he was 18 and eventually became responsible for weapons purchases. Assiri received his master's degree in Human Rights and Political Communications from Kingston University and has a bachelor's degree in Administration.  Political and human rights activism  Assiri described his human rights concerns starting with the worries of air force colleagues who felt that their salaries were unfairly low in comparison to the wealth of members of the Saudi royal family. Assiri started becoming involved in online political forums in 2004. In 2006 he attended five or six public forums organised by Saud al-Hashimi in Jeddah, in which guests included the Palestinian Khaled Mashal and the Tunisian Rached Ghannouchi. He became involved in protests during an air force training period in London beginning in 2009. At the end of this period, he returned to Saudi Arabia but had difficulty finding work. = Political asylum = In 2013, Assiri returned to London to study human rights at Kingston University. In 2014, worried by the arrests of Abdullah al-Hamid and Mohammad Fahad al-Qahtani of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association and the long prison sentences that they received and by news from his colleagues that he would most likely be imprisoned if he returned to Saudi Arabia, he applied for political asylum in the United Kingdom. Assiri founded Al Qst (or ALQST), a human rights organisation, in August 2014. In 2015, he expressed concern that British authorities might have been delaying his request for political asylum in order to force him and his family to return to Saudi Arabia.Paul Gallagher (16 October 2015). \\"Saudi dissident 'may be forced to return home' by UK Government despite torture fears\\".

The wine region is entirely included within the larger Columbia Valley AVA. Ancient Lakes of the Columbia Valley became the 13th AVA in Washington State on October 18, 2012.  Geography  Missoula Floods Lying between the Beezley Hills to the North and the Frenchman Hills to the south, the growing region was severely impacted by the immense water flows of the Missoula floods. The scouring effect of the waters stripped the top soils down to the basalt and scoured out canyons referred to locally as \\"coulees\\" which are prominent features near many of the planted vineyards. The Columbia River forms the western border of the grape growing region.  Soils  Basalt and caliche rock are unique in their prominence of the soils in the grape growing areas. Missoula floods scoured the area stripping the original top soils along the western edge of the Quincy valley. Large standing pools of water left by the floods created thick deposits of caliche that lay over the basalt. With time, both rock types have fractured and are prominent in the soils. Quincy loam and windblown loess soils lay over the rocks.  Climate  The growing region lies close to the easternmost foothills of the Cascade Mountain range. A strong rain shadow effect gives the area one of the lowest precipitation rates in the Columbia Valley. 500x500px  Grape growing  Deep in the heart of Washington Wine country, white wine grapes represent the bulk of the grape plantings in the growing region and are planted on the higher elevations (avg. 1200‚Äì1500') along the Beezley Hills and the Evergreen and Babcock ridges. White Riesling, Chardonnay, and Pinot Gris are dominant plantings along with red varieties used for ros√©-style wines Red wine varieties are planted in close proximity to the Columbia River along the benches and exposed basalt cliffs formed by the \\"cataract effects\\" of the Missoula floods.

It has thin, rough bark on the base of the trunk, smooth bark above, linear to narrow lance- shaped adult leaves, flower buds arranged in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped to conical fruit.flower budsflowers and fruit Description Eucalyptus effusa is a mallee or small tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has persistent, thin ribbony bark on the trunk, sometimes on the lower branches and smooth brownish bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have lance-shaped to curved leaves that are long and wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are linear to narrow lance-shaped, usually the same glossy green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to more or less cylindrical, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from October to March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup- shaped to conical capsule long and wide with the valves at rim level or extended beyond it. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus effusa was first formally described in 1976 by the botanist Ian Brooker who published the description in the journal Nuytsia. The type specimen was collected by George Chippendale between Norseman and Balladonia in 1967. In 1991, Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill described two subspecies that have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census and the descriptions were published in the journal Telopea: * Eucalyptus effusa Brooker subsp. effusa, commonly known as rough- barked gimlet, has a conical operculum; * Eucalyptus effusa subsp. exsul, commonly known as desert gimlet, has a rounded operculum and slightly glaucous branchlets. E. effusa is one of the nine true gimlet species that have buds in groups of seven, and the only gimlet that is a mallee. The other true gimlets are E. campaspe, E. creta, E. diptera, E. jimberlanica, E. ravida, E. terebra, E. salubris and E. tortilis. Distribution and habitat Rough-barked gimlet is found on stony rises and plains between the Fraser Range and Balladonia in the Coolgardie and Nullarbor biogeographic regions of Western Australia where it grows in shallow sandy or loamy soils over greenstone or laterite. Desert gimlet is only known from a small area near Youanmi. Conservation status Both subspecies of Eucalyptus effusa are classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

As Spring practice wound down in late March, Speight, O'Korn and Morris seemed to be the leading three, in that order. On September 3 before the opening game against Hawaii, Speight was named as the starting quarterback. Peters did not see game action during the 2016 season. In 2017, Peters was engaged in a quarterback battle with incumbent starter Wilton Speight and 2016 backup John O'Korn. On August 12, 2017, Jim Harbaugh revealed that Speight and O'Korn are the leaders in the quarterback battle, with Peters designated to a back-up role. In a game against Rutgers on October 28, 2017, Peters replaced O'Korn in the second quarter, with the game tied 7‚Äì7. He led the team to 3 consecutive scoring drives, including throwing the teams first touchdown pass in over a month en route to a 35‚Äì14 victory. Peters would go on to start the next 3 games, winning against Minnesota, winning at Maryland, and in the loss at Wisconsin. Peters would get concussed in the 3rd quarter against Wisconsin and did not recover until the Outback Bowl. Peters would start in the bowl game however, which was a 19‚Äì26 loss to South Carolina. For the 2018 season, Peters was the 3rd string quarterback, backing up Shea Patterson and Dylan McCaffrey. He saw playing time in the 49‚Äì3 win against Western Michigan, the 56‚Äì10 win against Nebraska, the 42‚Äì7 win against Penn State, the 42‚Äì7 win at Rutgers (where he led a scoring drive), and the 39‚Äì62 loss at Ohio State where he set up a rushing touchdown with a completion to the one yard line. =Illinois= On June 18, 2019, Peters announced that he would be transferring to Illinois.

The club covers a wide area and current players live in many different areas, including, Gants Hill, Woodford, Leyton, Leytonstone, Stratford, Romford, Dagenham, Brentwood & Chelmsford as well as many other areas. The club was founded in 1920 making it one of London's oldest GAA clubs. The club offers Hurling, Camogie, Gaelic Football and Ladies Football from u-8s up to Adults. History The club is named after former Lord Mayor of Cork and IRA officer Tom√°s Mac Curtain. Who was shot dead by members of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) during the Irish War of Independence. The Club was founded in 1920 from members of the Forest Gate Branch of the Gaelic League. They soon adopted the name of Tom√°s Mac Curtain in honour of the late Lord Mayor of Cork but were often referred to as Forest Gate in the early days. McCurtains first fixtures came in 1921 when they entered the first London GAA League & Championships to be played after World War 1 in both Hurling and Football with games being played in Manor Park Athletic Grounds. It is thought that they trained on Wanstead Flats though this is unconfirmed. They moved to The Leys, Ballards Road, Dagenham at the bequest of Ford's Dagenham sometime in the 1930s. In 1934 the club won their first Senior Football Championship and retained it the following year (1935). The club disbanded at the start of World War 2 and did not reform until 1948. It was at this time they were called Hibernians after a dance hall they frequented and potentially sponsored them. In the early 1950s (possibly ‚Äô52) they reverted to using the name Thomas McCurtains again. In 1955 the newly crowned All Ireland Hurling Champions, Cork (featuring Christy Ring), travelled to Dagenham and played a ‚ÄúDagenham Select‚Äù team which consisted heavily of McCurtains players. The Club won multiple championships at Junior and Intermediate grades in both codes over the decades before making the breakthrough winning the Senior Hurling Championship in 1987. With the upturn of economic fortunes in Ireland and the emergence of the Celtic Tiger economy the GAA in London struggled with many gaels returning home. As such the club struggled on the pitch in the 90's. Around the turn of the centaury, the club relocated once more to Goodmayes Hospital Sports Grounds where they currently reside.

As well as being awarded the Queen's Service Medal, Huloo, as he was known, is notable for having sailed a 65 year old junk from Taiwan to America, despite never having crewed a sail ship before, as well as rescuing adventurous Norwegian sailor Thor Heyerdahl. Biography Huloo was born in China in 1924. As a teenager Huloo learnt t'ai chi in Shanghai from Chen Wei-Ming. In 1949 Mao Zedong came to power while Huloo was working as a fisherman in Taiwan. At his father's advice he stayed in Taiwan. In 1955 he and five others sailed a junk renamed Free China from Taiwan to San Francisco, escaping the oppressive government in control at the time while also persuading that government to sponsor the trip as the Taiwanese entry in a boat race that was to run between USA's east coast and Sweden. None of the men had ever worked on a sail ship before. One of the five men was the USA Vice-consul to Taiwan who was placed on board to document the trip and a documentary movie was released. The journey was initially abandoned due to poor weather. When resumed it took 112 days including a delay in Japan for repairs after having hit Typhoon Annie so they were unable to enter the proposed race. While acclaimed as a sensation upon arrival Free China eventually fell into disrepair over the next several decades. It was privately repaired in the late 80s and as at 2007, after having been lost for several years, there was talk of it returning it to Taiwan. In 2006 the surviving crew were invited to belatedly celebrate the 50th anniversary of the sailing. The effort to save the junk from being scrapped were documented in The Free China Junk (2010) including its eventual return to Taiwan and a reunion of the crew. Huloo settled with his family in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1967. He worked in the marine industry where amongst other things he developed navigational aids. In 1970 he was asked by the UN to assist in searching and rescuing Thor Heyerdahl and the crew of Ra II who were attempting to sail from Morocco to Barbados in a papyrus boat. The search was successful and Heyerdahl was guided to port for four days. In Christchurch, Huloo offered t'ai chi instruction for free, saying that inability to pay was not a reason to deprive someone of the benefits of t'ai chi. Huloo led daily 6 am classes, variously over the years at Phillipstown School or Hagley Park or in a shed next to his house. Some of Huloo's students went on to found the New Zealand National Tai Chi Association in 1988. For his charitable efforts at promoting t'ai chi Huloo was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for community service in the 2002 New Year Honours. In 2003 he released an instructional DVD of his 84-form Yang-style t'ai chi. In 2008 a documentary of Huloo was made called simply Huloo.  Personal life  Hu died in Christchurch in 2013.

It is about halfway between Volgograd and Astrakhan, placing it about 200 km north of the Volga River Delta, where the river enters the Caspian Sea from the northwest. About 20 km east of the lake is the border with Kazakhstan. Baskunchak has been a source of salt to Russia for centuries. The reserve is an important site on the bird migration route between northern Siberia and wintering regions. The reserve is situated in the Akhtubinsky District of Astrakhan Oblast. Topography The reserve lies in the trough of the Caspian Depression, just east of the Volga's present main floodplain. The boundaries wrap around the north, east and south shores of the lake, and the mountain is in a separate sector just south of the lake. The main features - the shores of Lake Baskunchak and Big Bogdo Mountain, are seated about 25 meters below sea level. The top of Big Bogdo is 130 meters above the terrain. The hill itself is a karst (limestone) formation with over 30 caves. It is growing approximately 1 mm in height each year due to the pressure of the underlying salt dome.

This region, on the north and northeast shores of the Caspian Sea, is characterized by sand dunes and ridges, salt soil, clay deserts (takyrs), and in places solonchaks (shors) or salt pans of 30‚Äì40 cm thickness devoid of vegetation. The sedimentary landscape is recently exposed lake bed (during the Tertiary the Caspian Basin was connected across the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.) The climate of Bogdinsko-Baskunchakski is Humid continental climate, cool summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dwb)). This climate is characterized by high variation in temperature, both daily and seasonally; with dry winters and cool summers. Average annual temperature is 15.4 C. Annual precipitation averages 150 mm. Flora and fauna Plant life is sparse but features highly specialized halophytes (salt-tolerant plants). Big Bogdo Mountain is the only habitat in Russia of the squeaky gecko (Alsophylax pipiens). It is also a site for the endangered Russian Steppe eagle. Russian steppe eagle (endangered) Pygmy cormorant Ecotourism Big Bogdo mountain is considered a sacred site by some Buddhists, and there is one trail open to visitors - a 2.5 km hike to Big Bogdo (\\"Trail Legends of the Holy Mountain\\") with an observation deck and informational placards. There is also driving tour escorted by reserve officers to the shore of the lake. Passes must be obtained from the reserve office in Akhtubinsk. As a strict nature reserve in a sensitive environment, however, most of the Reserve is closed to the general public and access is strictly guarded by patrols. Scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with reserve management for visits.

Please visit systemds.apache.org for > information. Apache SystemML is a flexible machine learning system that automatically scales to Spark and Hadoop clusters. SystemML's distinguishing characteristics are: # Algorithm customizability via R-like and Python-like languages. # Multiple execution modes, including Standalone, Spark Batch, Spark MLContext, Hadoop Batch, and JMLC. # Automatic optimization based on data and cluster characteristics to ensure both efficiency and scalability. History SystemML was created in 2010 by researchers at the IBM Almaden Research Center led by IBM Fellow Shivakumar Vaithyanathan. It was observed that data scientists would write machine learning algorithms in languages such as R and Python for small data. When it came time to scale to big data, a systems programmer would be needed to scale the algorithm in a language such as Scala. This process typically involved days or weeks per iteration, and errors would occur translating the algorithms to operate on big data. SystemML seeks to simplify this process. A primary goal of SystemML is to automatically scale an algorithm written in an R-like or Python-like language to operate on big data, generating the same answer without the error-prone, multi-iterative translation approach. On June 15, 2015, at the Spark Summit in San Francisco, Beth Smith, General Manager of IBM Analytics, announced that IBM was open- sourcing SystemML as part of IBM's major commitment to Apache Spark and Spark- related projects. SystemML became publicly available on GitHub on August 27, 2015 and became an Apache Incubator project on November 2, 2015. On May 17, 2017, the Apache Software Foundation Board approved the graduation of Apache SystemML as an Apache Top Level Project.

The immature stages develop in log holes, hoofprints, boats, wells, tree trunks, tree holes, bamboo cups and pots, occasional utensils, rock pools, rock holes, in pools in rock outcrops or river beds, and coral, and occasionally at the peak of the breeding season, in open concrete floodwater drains. Immature stages have been found in association with Aedes albopictus, Aedes malayensis, and Culex species. In northern Nigeria no adults were caught in traps baited with goats, sheep, monkeys and pig; porcupine was the most important host in the area. Medical importance A demonstrated human-biter, Aedes vittatus can transmit yellow fever virus in monkeys in the laboratory and was a suspected vector in the 1940 Nuba Mountain epidemic in Sudan in which an estimated 15,000 human cases and 1,500 deaths were reported. Aedes vittatus is potentially capable of transmitting Zika virus, the causative agent of Zika fever. The adult females have a short crepuscular biting period, with maximum activity between 1800 and 2100 hours.

It was one of the best examples of Neo-Mud√©jar architecture in Madrid and one of the palaces that the Spanish financial elite of the second half of the 19th century had built along the paseos del Prado, Recoletos and la Castellana.  History  In the 19th century it was in Madrid the called \\"Barrio de los Banqueros\\" situated in the zone of the paseos del Prado and Recoletos, Plaza de Cibeles and adjacent streets. It was in this part of the city where took up residence the wealthier families. It was here that was built the Palace of Xifr√© Downing (son of Josep Xifr√© i Casas), which was located in the Paseo del Prado on the corner with Calle Lope de Vega. The Palace, a small imitation of the Alhambra in Granada, was built by Catalan businessman Jose Xifr√© Downing between 1862 and 1865. Josep Xifr√© Downing was heir to a large fortune thanks to his Catalan father, Josep Xifr√© i Casas, who owned multiple businesses in Cuba, the US and Europe. The son met the architect Jos√© Contreras who was then the restorer of the Alhambra. Contreras, was a pioneer of Neo-al-Andalusian architecture and before starting the construction of the Palace, he received a six-month scholarship from Xifr√© to study the incorporation of the decorations of the Alhambra in his future Palace. In 1857, the financier bought nine sites located between Calle Lope de Vega and Trajineros (current Paseo del Prado) to the Duke of Medinaceli. The area had begun installing the elite members of Madrid. The construction works discoursed between 1858 and 1862. The missing Palacio de Xifr√©, was one of the best examples of Madrilenian Neo-Mud√©jar architecture. Possibly in its time it was one of the most sumptuous buildings of Madrid. From the outer gate, through the facades and all inside, imitated in a very good way the golden age of the al-Aldalusian architecture. On the death of Josep Xifr√© Downing, his son Josep Xifr√© Hamel. Hamel sold the palace in 1914. The palace became the Delegation of Mexico to own the building, Mexican Ambassador Manuel de Iturbe. After years of neglect, the building was purchased by the Duke of the Infantado for his own residence. The Duchy of the Infantado is a title granted by the Catholic Monarchs on July 22, 1475 to Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, 2nd Marquis of Santillana. In 1949, the palace was purchased by a real estate that dropped it a year later to build the building of the National Trade Union Office now the Ministry of Health.  Remains  Part of the remains of the palace are preserved today as: The facade that was acquired by Arturo Ruiz Pi√±a, to incorporate it into a hotel in the village of Losa de Riofr√≠o, in Castile and Le√≥n. The beautiful staircase of the Palace went to the town of Chiloeches, in Castilla-La Mancha. The Embassy of France acquired the hardwood floors. The Marquises of Deleitosa bought eaves, decorations for install them on their farm in Salamanca. The central courtyard, with its marble columns, was acquired by Jos√© Soto Huerta, for mounting on a farm he owned in the old highway of Barajas. The Directorate General of Architecture bought a number of windows to be deposited at the School of Architecture, but were literally plundered to exception of the bulky parts that with over the years, these are badly damaged.

When local citizens bought company's bonds, the company donated 250 books to the town. The books were housed in the Masonic Hall. The Carnegie Corporation of New York accepted Eagle Grove's application for a grant for $10,000 to build a library building on April 26, 1902.

It covers 71,000 km2 and straddles five states, running almost 8,000 kilometers.  Description  Kelp forests are a defining feature of the reef system. The reef supports economic activities along Australia's southern coastline, such as commercial and recreational fishing, scuba diving, surfing and other tourism. These activities contribute at least $10 billion to the Australian economy each year. Biologically, it is a unique temperate marine ecosystem, with 30 to 80% of its species found nowhere else.

Characters =Nodos= A Nodos is a person carrying the \\"essence\\" of a Heroic Tribesman, and can thus transform into a member of the Heroic Tribe. In this form they have superhuman abilities, including enhanced strength and agility, breathing in space, sustaining weapon fire and explosions without injury, and enduring atmospheric reentry.Heroic Age episode 8, Flashing Nodos. They also seem able to freely move in zero-gravity. The Heroic Tribe life-form is stored in a stone that is sealed in the body. Each Nodos, including Age, has a contract with a fixed set of rules, called \\"labors\\". With the exception of Age, these include protecting the Silver Tribe's Nodos, Yuty. Yuty mentions that if they do not abide by their contracts, each of their races would be destroyed. The labors of the Nodos appear to be conflicting with each other. In extremely violent battles, such as when two or more Nodos fight, they will go completely berserk, attacking and destroying everything around them, having been consumed by their own instincts. The Silver Tribe refer to this state as being in a \\"Frenzy\\". Aware of the Heroic Tribe having destroyed hundreds of solar systems while in a Frenzy, the Silver Tribe strives to prevent multiple Nodos from fighting each other, regardless of the cost. ; : :Age has the body of a sixteen-year-old boy, but is at least 120 years old; it is unknown how much of this time he was actually \\"living\\", as he may have been in stasis for over 100 years. Age lived on the ruined planet Oron, a world that was once verdant and peaceful, but later suffered from a cosmic cataclysm; he lived in an old, abandoned ship, and he addressed the mainframe A.I. of the ship as his mother. Age is wild by nature, but he can nevertheless be extremely good-natured. Since he was taught by the Golden Tribe, whom he considered to be his fathers, Age has limited knowledge about human society, not even knowing the meaning of \\"numbers\\", simple words, or common phrases. He has an artistic side, which is often expressed in his elaborate paintings of future events on the walls of the Argonaut. :Age's character is likely based on the mythological hero Hercules. :Age's Nodos form is called . Bellcross has a humanoid body approximately tall, and joints made of very large blue spheres. It is shown to have the ability to absorb its enemies' life force and release it as a destructive energy blast. :Bellcross is considered to be the strongest of the remaining Heroic Tribe. Like the other remaining members of the Heroic Tribe, he apparently lives only for destruction and can apparently counter all the other 4 Nodos' powers with ease. While Frenzied, he releases powerful shock waves whenever he moves through space, powerful enough to destroy nearby ships. Iron Tribe computers calculated that if he continued to remain in Frenzy, he would ultimately release energy on the scale of a supernova explosion. Bellcross' main ability is originally thought to be existence, but it is later revealed that he is the key to The Golden Tribe's power. ; : :Karkinos is a calm thinker and not easily provoked. His purple Heroic Tribe form, \\"Lernaea\\", employs some sort of corrosive gas, or similar material, as a means of attack. It is implied that this power can destroy entire solar systems. It appears as if he is capable of resurrection.Heroic Age episode 23, Four People. :His name is based on Karkinos, a crab that tried to help a hydra defeat Heracles. Accordingly, Karkinos' Heroic Tribe form can transform into a type of hydra when on solid ground. Lernaea's main ability is thought to be Life, then revealed to be Restoration. :Karkinos' contract with the Silver Tribe contains four Labors. ; : :A Nodos from the Planet Pore. Despite having destroyed many planets in the past, he now despises fighting, and hates to see others hurt as a result of it. His red Heroic Tribe form, \\"Artemia\\", is capable of firing massive energy beams which can engulf entire planets. Artemia also possesses the ability to turn its body into energy, which can reflect or refract energy weapons. However, it is vulnerable to gravity-based laser beams. Mehitak will not eat anything with a \\"life\\", instead drawing sustenance by consuming raw matter such as metal. Artemia's power is thought to be Light, but is then revealed to be Waves (energy fluctuation). Mehitak's contract with the Silver Tribe contains three Labors. ; : :Lekty has the ability to teleport herself and anyone she is touching at the same time, similar to Iolaous. She is curious about why the Golden Tribe gave their tribe such an unreasonable contract, and often visits Prome to discuss their fate. She shows a measure of affection and concern for Mehitak, and is saddened whenever he must fight. Her green Hero Tribe form, \\"Erymanthos\\", allows her to manipulate time. Erymanthos is originally thought to be Time, but her true power lies in collecting the past of infinite realities, then giving them to the future to form a common destiny. Lekty's contract with the Silver Tribe contains five Labors. ; : :Yuty La is a member of the Silver Tribe, thus having the ability to create spiritual projections of herself, and has also shown the ability of teleportation. The young female is the unspoken \\"leader\\" of the four Silver Tribe's Nodos. Yuty's philosophy can be summed up in her first response to Karkinos' question about the fifth Nodos: \\"People who do not submit to the Silver Tribe have no need to live.\\" Although she seems cruel, Yuty has been shown to care for the life of Karkinos, and may have feelings for him. Yuty is under the direct control of Rome Ro, and cannot act without his express order. Yuty's black Hero Tribe form, \\"Kervius\\", can surround itself with a powerful shield capable of deflecting energy weapons, even beams strong enough to destroy a star. Kervius has the power to create massive vortexes that act like black holes, swallowing whole fleets of ships and sending them into \\"nothingness\\". This power is considered the most devastating out of the five Nodos. Kervius's power is thought to be Nothingness, but it is revealed to be the gate to the Golden Tribe's power. Yuty's contract with the Silver Tribe contains eight Labors. =Humans (Iron Tribe) = Humanity is known to the rest of the universe as the \\"Iron Tribe\\", the name given to them by the Golden Tribe. The Iron Tribe was the last tribe to be able to travel in space, but also the only tribe to develop the necessary technology on their own. The Silver and Bronze Tribes consider the Iron Tribe to be inferior because, unlike them, the Iron Tribe was not granted this ability by the Golden Tribe. When humanity began to explore space, Earth was attacked by the Bronze Tribe (under the Silver Tribe's control). Human life on Earth was exterminated and humanity was scattered among the stars, pursued by the Bronze and Silver Tribes. Humanity is shown united under a constitutional monarchy; while there are princes and princesses, decisions appear to be made by democratic vote. Humanity is capable of interstellar travel and has highly advanced technology (the series shows computer AIs and virtual reality screens), but it is portrayed inferior to the capabilities of the Silver and Bronze tribes. ; : :The young princess of the Iron Tribe and the heroine of the story. By using information passed down by the royal family, she searches for the one she considers their savior. Along with her psychic and telepathic powers, she has the power to create spiritual projections, though not as powerful as those of the Silver Tribe. Her telepathic powers also seem to be so powerful that she can automatically read the minds of those around her. It also is revealed that Dhianeila cannot handle the spiritual waves of an impure man, so men have to be at least 10 meters away from her, or else she may lose consciousness and collapse.Heroic Age episode 2, Forgotten Child.XEBEC's Heroic Age terminology section. The only man to have ever been able to approach her, and make her not lose herself is Age. As the story progresses her feelings for Age eventually grow into love. :Her character is based on Deianira, a figure in Greek mythology. ; : :The young leader of the Yunos Knights, a squadron of robot fighter pilots. Uptight but very responsible, he is extremely loyal to Dhianeila. He initially dislikes Age and gets jealous over Dhianeila becoming close to him, but quickly becomes one of his closest friends. Iolaous has a secret collection of holographic pictures of Dhianeila. :Iolaous has the ability to teleport himself and another, when he touches them. The range of this ability is most likely intra-planetary, with his longest teleport being from orbit around Titarros to the surface of said planet. Iolaous can only teleport others along with him if they are mentally willing to do so. His mecha can teleport when a special engine is engaged, and the engine is also capable of transporting other mechas along with his own, if distance between Iolaous' and the other mechas allows. :His character is based on Iolaus, a Theban who became a close friend of Heracles. ; : :Personal attendant to Princess Dhianeila. She is also part of Argonaut's medic crew and has the ability to heal others. She appears to have a fondness for Iolaous, who has told her that she has great skills as a medic. ; and : :Twins with telekinetic abilities. A bit childlike and irresponsible, but always cheerful. They are also skilled engineers and mecha pilots; their mechas correspond with their telekinetic abilities. As Dhianeila's attendants, they were put in charge of \\"babysitting\\" Age, but are often involved in Age's childish antics. When Iolaous is depressed, they sell him pictures of Dhianeila. ; : :Commander of the Argonaut. His mission is to protect the Princess Dhianeila and to carry out her wishes. He is also Iolaous' and the twins' father. :Mobeedo's character is likely derived from Jason, who was the leader of the Argonauts during the quest to find the Golden Fleece. ; : :A female military officer of the Iron Tribe, and acting commander of the Azz-Azoth fleet. She and Captain Mobeedo were in officer's school together. It is said that she has the worst luck, but is highly dependable. She seems to have a rough demeanor, but is well respected by her crew. She is later transferred to Meleagros' flagship, the Althaea. ; : :The oldest prince of the Royal family that leads humanity, and commander of the flagship Althaea and the Calydonian fleet. Dim-witted, arrogant but ambitious, he desires to lead humanity to conquer the universe. He cares nothing for others, and is envious of Dhianeila's reputation among many nobles, and only sees her as someone who comes between him and the throne. Despite that, he considers her and Age as useful tools, but ones that can easily be discarded. Moreover, he repeatedly refers to Age/Bellcross as a monster. :His name is based on a Greek hero, Meleager, who incidentally became one of the Argonauts. ; : :The second prince of the Royal family, commander of the elite Kento Knights, and Meleagros's right hand. He supports Meleagros in his quest to conquer the universe, and shares some of his personality to boot. He also thinks of his only sister, Dhianeila, as nothing but a pest. :His name is based on Atalanta, who in Greek mythology was a female warrior that loved Meleagros. = Silver Tribe = The Silver Tribe see themselves as the new \\"guardians\\" of space; believing that every other tribe that is inferior to them deserves to be conquered by them. Compared to other tribes, the Silver appear to be more powerful, immune to illnesses, living longer lives, and having the power to create energy from nothing. Each tribesman has been shown to possess common powers, such as long-ranged telepathy and teleportation, and creating spiritual projections. Unlike other tribes, the Silver Tribe consists of a small amount of tribesmen; their powerful spiritual powers, which helps them create superior technology, makes up for their low population. The Silver Tribe has helped many lesser species obtain low-orbit space status, but prohibited long-range space and interstellar space travel. The Silver Tribe consider individual star systems worthless, but gain wealth and power by obtaining tribute from the tribes that they have lifted up. ; : :A member of the Silver Tribe, who has been tasked with destroying the Argonaut. Like Dhianeila, he has been shown to be able to create spiritual projections of himself, but in a far more powerful form that can project shields, and attack with short-range tentacle-spades. He too believes that the Iron Tribe is inferior to the Silver Tribe, and also believes that they are nothing more than barbarians. This belief is heavily enforced after he witnesses the destruction of Jupiter at the hands of the Iron Tribe. Later, after his starship is destroyed by Bellcross, Phaetho O is shown to be able to survive in hard vacuum unaided for an extended period of time. He can also create another starship in space from nothingness in minutes.Heroic Age episode 20, Nodos of Darkness. because his last name O is the same as Prome's last name, it is possible that they are related, although how they are related is unknown ; : :Commands all the Nodos except Age. He also appears to be Yuty and Phaetho O's superior. It is later revealed that Rom Ror was present when the Golden Tribe withdrew from the galaxy, and personally chased after members of the Golden Tribe, demanding that they stay and continue teaching the Silver Tribe. ; : :She is in charge of the Silver Tribe's emotions, and can transfer emotions from her tribesmen into her, thus erasing it from them. She has also been seen sitting on a throne, talking to Lecty about the Nodos' contracts. = Bronze Tribe = An insectoid species, the Bronze Tribe is seen by other tribes in the galaxy as the Silver Tribe's enforcement arm. Very numerous, the Bronze Tribe uses hollowed-out asteroids as starships utilizing the same Starway and Warp technology of the Silver and Iron Tribes. The Bronze Tribe's powers differ from other tribes; they seem to have limited telepathic powers, but none show the spiritual projections of the Silver and Iron Tribes. Bronze Tribe individuals create personal force shields and project beams of energy at a target from those shields. Bronze Tribe insect bodies can survive the vacuum of space and the heat of atmospheric entry, but are still vulnerable to normal damage. At close range, acid spits from their fanged mouths. While a subset of the tribe have teleportation powers, rather than the instantaneous dematerialization/re-materialization of Iolaous and Lekty, the insects instead create gates or wormhole portals between interplanetary locations. When the Iron Tribe combined fleet attacked Taros, the Bronze Tribe's home planet, the gates were large enough for entire asteroid ships to pass through. The Bronze Tribe has not shown a single Queen in its reproductive cycle, nor a pupa stage; the young hatch from egg sacs and mature to adult size afterward. A humanoid-shaped \\"controller\\" can be found at the heart of each asteroid ship. It is not known how the Silver Tribe convinced the Bronze Tribe to serve them so unswervingly, nor what the Bronze Tribe receives from its relationship with the Silver Tribe. Labors Each tribe possessing one or several Nodos is allowed to make a contract with them. They can draw a specific number of clauses (called 'Labors'), the amount of which was determined beforehand by the Golden Tribe. =Iron Tribe - The 12 Labors= The Iron Tribe was allowed to make twelve Labors, thus drawing a parallel to Heracles' Twelve Labors. The Iron Tribe's contract goes as follows: #Treat your contractor as your King. #To serve the King and never become one. #Recover the homeland Earth to the hands of humans who are called the \\"Tribe of Iron\\". #Fight against all survivors of \\"Tribe of Heroic\\" and defeat every one of them. #Secure the Mother Planet of \\"Tribe of Bronze\\" to the hands of humans. #Secure the Mother Planet of \\"Tribe of Silver\\" to the hands of humans. #Obtain the powers of \\"Tribes of Gold\\" to foresee the future. #Obtain the knowledge of \\"Tribes of Gold\\" to generate Stars. #To make humans who are called \\"Tribe of Iron\\" to become the master of universe. #To protect the bonding party until these labors are fulfilled. #To not escape or die until these labors are fulfilled. #When these labors are fulfilled, humans also known as \\"Tribe of Iron\\" will make one contractor‚Äôs wish come true as long as such wish do not breach the 11th agreement. Note - The above 12 labors were directly translated in episode 2 of the anime‚Äîthe contract is meant for Age, the Nodos entrusted with protecting the 'Iron Tribe'. =Silver Tribe Labors= The content of some of the Silver Tribe's contracts is still unknown, but it appears to involve the protection of Yuty by the rest of the Silver Tribe's Nodos. Silver Tribe members Rom Ror and Prome O were the chief architects of the contracts. The Silver Tribe has made contracts with a total of four Nodos: *Karkinos - contract with the Silver Tribe contains 4 Labors. While Kalkinos's contract has not been fully enumerated, it involves the protection of Yuty even at the cost of his own life. :# You must fight those who oppose the Tribe of Silver with your life. :# When the Silver Tribe attains the power of the Gold Tribe, you shall be released from servitude. *Mehitak - contract with the Silver Tribe contains 3 Labors: :# To ensure obedience to the Silver Tribe. :# As a Nodos, until all your power is spent in battle, you will obey the Silver Tribe. :# You will protect the life of the Nodos of the Silver Tribe. *Lekty - contract with the Silver Tribe contains 5 Labors: :# By submitting to the will of the Silver Tribe, your tribe shall prosper. :# You must fight against the enemies of the Silver Tribe as a Nodos. :# When the Nodos of the Silver Tribe is in danger, you must save her. :# When you have discovered the power of the Golden Tribe, you must inform the Silver Tribe. :# When the power of the Golden Tribe is being lost, you must protect it. *Yuty - contract with the Silver Tribe contains 8 Labors. While Yuty's contract has not been fully enumerated, it is chiefly concerned with obtaining the power of the Golden Tribe. She is also tasked with destroying that power should it fall out of the hands of the Silver Tribe.

Biography M√∏rup was born at N√∏rup in South Jutland and died in √òdum in East Jutland. Christian M√∏rup's parents were copyholders at Engelsholm Castle and his father a master builder. M√∏rup was taught the masonry craft by his father and was later educated in architectural drawing and planning by Nicolaus Hinrich Rieman. In 1760, the master builder of Bidstrup Manor died and M√∏rup was tasked with finishing the project. The following year he designed an extension for Aarhus Cathedral School which is today known as the White Building. The extension was extensively altered in 1847 when it was given an additional floor and a neoclassical appearance. In 1780 M√∏rup built Randers City hall which may be his best known work and which was protected as a listed building in 1918. In 1795, he was the builder of a rebuilding of St Martin's Church, Randers. Christian Jensen M√∏rup worked in a dated Baroque style with some newer elements such as the lesene-arch framing the porch portal in Bidstrup Church which can be found in all his later works. Randers City Hall also has elements thought to be inspired by works by Niels Eigtved.

In early 1546, with Ottoman help, he staged a revolt against his brother Tahmasp I (r. 1524‚Äì1576), who was king at the time. Biography Of the four sons that survived of Ismail I, Alqas was the second one. Sam Mirza was probably his full brother, while Bahram Mirza and (the future king) Tahmasp were brothers born by other mothers. In 1532/33, he was given the governorship of Astarabad by Tahmasp (by that time king), while Badr Khan Ustajlu was made his regent (lala). In March 1538 Tahmasp I ordered Alqas with his regent to move against the rebel Shirvanshah, and six months later he was appointed governor of Shirvan, where he remained for the next eight years. During the frequent Caucasian campaigns under Tahmasp's tenure, Alqas was ordered to attack the Circassians, who however defeated him. Afterwards, he was appointed governor of Derbent (Darband). He started to openly revolt there, which included minting his own coins. Upon hearing of this, Tahmasp, at that time in a winter campaign in Georgia, started to march upon Derbent. Alqas subsequently fled Derbent, to Crimea, while by early 1547, Tahmasp had already re-taken Derbent. As Crimea passed into Ottoman hands at that time, Alqas moved to Istanbul by sea, arriving there towards the end of summer 1547. At Istanbul, he contacted the Ottoman sultan Suleiman, explaining his reason of departure from Iran, as well as his desire to return there as an Ottoman client. Upon hearing this, Suleiman hastily moved from Edirne to meet the exiled Alqas, who promised strong Qizilbash support if Suleiman might help him, and he may have converted to Sunnism.

Farrell spent his first few years in Morgantown, West Virginia before moving to Huntington. There he would graduate from Huntington East High School in 1990. Farrell would later graduate from University of Notre Dame in 1994, and the West Virginia University College of Law in 1997, where he was the managing editor of the Law Review. 2016 presidential campaign Ballot access thumbleftPercentage of vote received by county On January 28, 2016, Farrell filed for President of the United States for the Democratic Party in West Virginia. He cited West Virginia's disenchantment with the national candidates as his motivation for running, noting U.S. President Barack Obama's poor showing in the 2012 Democratic Primary in West Virginia. Farrell did not plan to run in any additional states, instead saying he would like to bring national attention to the 'economically gutted regions of the state' caused by the war on coal. Farrell came in third in the West Virginia primary, receiving just under 9 percent of the vote. In his best performance, Farrell came in second place in Mingo County, beating Hillary Clinton by 113 votes. He lost to Bernie Sanders, who won every county in the state.  Career  Farrell practiced for 15 years at the law firm of Greene, Ketchum, Farrell, Bailey & Tweel where he was a partner. His work at Greene Ketchum focused primarily on medical malpractice and personal injury lawsuits. In January 2020, Farrell launched his own law firm, Farrell Law.  Opioid epidemic  Farrell's home state of West Virginia has been the epicenter of the opioid epidemic. Between 2007 and 2012, drug distribution companies shipped 780 million doses of opioids to West Virginia, and 1,728 overdose deaths occurred. In 2017, Farrell filed a series of lawsuits against the drug company distributors under the state's public nuisance laws. The suits, filed on behalf of various counties, seek to hold the drug distribution companies accountable for the cost incurred fighting the epidemic.

Postoperative wound healing occurs after surgery and normally follows distinct bodily reactions: the inflammatory response, the proliferation of cellular and tissues that initiate healing, and the final remodeling. Postoperative wounds are different from other wounds in that they are anticipated and treatment is usually standardized depending on the type of surgery performed. Since the wounds are 'predicted' actions can be taken beforehand and after surgery that can reduce complications and promote healing.  Healing sequence  The body responds to postoperative wounds in the same manner as it does to tissue damage acquired in other circumstances. The inflammatory response is designed to create homeostasis. This first step is called the inflammatory stage. The next stage and wound healing is the infiltration of leukocytes and release of cytokines into the tissue. The inflammatory response and the infiltration of leukocytes occur simultaneously. The final stage of postoperative wound healing is called remodeling. Remodeling restores the structure of the tissue and that tissues ability to regain its function.  Diagnosis  Surgical wounds can begin to open between three and five days after surgery. The wound usually appears red and can be accompanied by drainage. Clinicians delay re- opening the wound unless it is necessary due to the potential of other complications. If the surgical wound worsens, or if a rupture of the digestive system is suspected the decision may be to investigate the source of the drainage or infection.  Complications  = Wound dehiscence = The rates of a surgical wound opening after surgery has remained constant. When a wound opens after surgery, the hospital stay becomes longer and the medical care becomes more intensive if a surgical wound opens after surgery. = Infection = Infection will complicate healing of surgical wounds and is commonly observed. Most infections are present within the first 30 days after surgery. Surgical wounds can become infected by bacteria, regardless if the bacteria is already present on the patient's skin or if the bacteria is spread to the patient due to contact with infected individuals. Wound infections can be superficial (skin only), deep (muscle and tissue), or spread to the organ or space where the surgery occurred. Recent studies have established that infection after surgery can occur after several years post surgery, and these infection rates are not recorded due to loss in patient follow up, hard to access record of previous surgery, visiting a new surgeon, lack of requirement from national registries etc. = Fascia dehiscence = The surgical site or wound may allow the passage of air into the body. This most often occurs after abdominal and pelvic surgery. Treatment at this point becomes more complex depending upon the extent of the opening, where it occurs and if contents of the digestive system have entered the body. Risks The risk of complications of the surgical wound is greater for those greater than 65-years-old, or who have pulmonary disease, nutritional deficiencies, overweight, other illnesses and high blood pressure.  Prevention  Complications of postsurgical wounds can be reduced before, during and after surgery. Some measures such as antibiotic prophylaxis before caesarean section and hernial repair are useful in reducing surgical site infection. There is also evidence that adhesive tapes increase infection risks. Before surgery, clinicians can treat the patient to reduce hemoglobin A1c levels to less than 7%. Those anticipating surgery can reduce their risk of complications by stopping smoking thirty days prior to surgery. The patient's skin can be evaluated for the presence of Staphylococcus aureus prior to surgery since this bacterium causes wound infections in postoperative wounds. Treating any other infections prior to surgery also reduces the risks of a postoperative wound infection. Examples of these pre-existing infections are urinary tract infection or lower reproductive system infection. Removing the hair where the skin will be cut helps to reduce the risk of complications, though shaving is not considered to be appropriate and instead depilatories are used. Those who come in contact with the person who is receiving the surgery clean and disinfect their own skin surfaces. The patient's skin is also cleaned, scrubbed and treated with antiseptics. Patients undergoing surgery often receive antibiotics before surgery. During the surgery, there are several precautions that can be taken to reduce the risk of postoperative wound complications. These are: minimizing traffic in the operating room, providing adequate ventilation, not closing wounds that are infected, minimize tissue handling, re-administer prophylactic antibiotics if large amounts of fluid are lost during surgery, and keeping the patient warm. Lately, studies have highlighted new preventative measures of avoiding repeated reprocessing and intraoperatively guarding the implants in the sterile-field, for surgeries implanting single-use devices such as orthopedic and spine surgeries. The risk of complications after surgery can be reduced by: maintaining blood glucose levels in the normal range and constant evaluation of surgical site infection. There is insufficient evidence to show that whether applying cyanoacrylate microbial sealants on the wound site before operation is effective in reducing surgical site infection post surgery. There is no evidence that one type of hand antisepsis is better than the other in preventing surgical site infection. There is no evidence that plastic adhesive tapes reduces surgical site infections.

The fish weir is an array of rocks in a V-shaped formation in the Iowa River. It is the only structure of this kind in Iowa. It is not known when the fish weir was built, possibly in either the Late Prehistoric period or Early Historic period. Glacial boulders from a nearby bluff were probably used to construct it. Each wing of the dam is about in length. The fish were thought to be herded toward the vertex of the \\"V\\" where they would be easier to net or spear. They were then placed into an adjacent holding pool. Early pioneers discovered the weir, and it was included on a General Land Office map in the 1840s. Archaeologist Charles R. Keyes wrote about the weir in 1925. Historically, the weir was submerged below the surface in high water. The Coralville Reservoir pool partially inundates the preserve, which also affects the visibility of the weir. There are three Indian burial mounds that date from the Early Woodland Period located nearby. The fish weir was relocated in 1952, and dedicated as an archaeological state preserve in 1976. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Shifting of the Iowa River in the 1990s appears to have buried the fish weir, and it is now south of the main river channel, possibly buried in silt.

While she was not the first artist to experiment with the copier, her work is distinguished by its focus on objects, her emphasis on the accessibility of the medium, and her efforts to unite image and text so that they may \\"fuse to become something other than either.\\" Personal life Hill was born Patricia Louise Guion Hill in Ashland, Kentucky in 1921. She moved to Charlottesville, Virginia with her mother at age eight. In her late teens, Hill attended George Washington University before moving to New York. Throughout her life, she moved between France and the United States before finally settling in Sens, Yonne, France in the 1990s. Beginning in 1956, she lived for several decades in Stonington, Connecticut. For several years in the late 1980s, Hill owned an antiques shop in Mystic, Connecticut. On the subject of marriage, Hill was recorded saying, \\"it was invented by the Devil‚Äîin the guise of a man.\\" She was married three times throughout her life. Her first marriage lasted approximately nine months. In the 1940s, Hill married her second husband, Robert Meservey, a skier for the Dartmouth Ski Team, in what was called \\"a wedding-on-skis.\\" Hill and Meservey skied to the church while Hill carried a bouquet of evergreen branches. Hill's marriage to Meservey was featured in a photo spread in LIFE. In 1960 after her two previous marriages, Hill married French gallerist Paul Bianchini, known for bringing attention to postwar artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Claes Oldenburg. In 1962, Hill gave birth to a daughter, Paola. Hill was widowed in 2000 when Bianchini died of cancer. Hill died in her home in Sens, France on September 19, 2014. Modeling career At age 19, Hill moved to New York where she worked as a model for the John Robert Powers Agency. In the late 1940s, Hill moved to Paris to continue her modeling career, becoming \\"a top-flight model\\" for Edward Molyneux and other designers. There, she modeled what she recalled was \\"the first collection of American clothes\\" in Paris. During the 1940s and 1950s, Hill was featured on the covers or in the layouts of magazines such as Harper's Bazaar, LIFE, and Elle. She modeled throughout her twenties and occasionally modeled for photographer and close friend Diane Arbus before withdrawing from fashion to retire to the French countryside. Writing career While living in a small house in France, Hill wrote a memoir, The Pit and the Century Plant, and her first novel, The Nine Mile Circle. The Pit and the Century Plant, an account of her experience in the French countryside, was praised for its evocative reflections and \\"vivid appreciation\\" of life among the French people. In this memoir, Hill recounts her experiences with \\"the hardships of country living,\\" forming a relationship with her neighbor across the road, and her dealings with nature. The Nine Mile Circle received both positive and mixed reviews, celebrated for its \\"charming style\\" but criticized for its familiar content. One reviewer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch praised The Nine Mile Circle for its intimate look into the lives of its characters, saying, \\"You finish The Nine Mile Circle feeling almost guilty at having witnessed so much that is private and personal in the lives of these people\\" and further calling her style \\"fresh and intriguing\\" while offering a swift criticism of the novel's lack of form. Several reviewers favorably compared Hill to William Faulkner for her depth of insight into her characters. Harper's Bazaar published an excerpt of The Nine Mile Circle entitled \\"Jetty's Black Rage\\" in their April 1956 issue. While modeling in New York in the 1940s, Hill began writing for Mademoiselle and Seventeen. In Paris, Hill contributed six short stories and an essay entitled \\"Cats\\" to The Paris Review in addition to an interview with Truman Capote. Her final contribution was published in Spring 1981. Through the early 1970s, Hill was granted and attended multiple residencies at the MacDowell Colony and Yaddo to work on her writing. Copy art In 1962, Hill began collecting informational art and objects as a housekeeper, which would become the subjects of her earliest works on the photocopier. She cited two experiences as her inspiration for experimenting with the photocopier. In one of her accounts, Hill accidentally copied her thumb while attempting to copy documents and was introduced to the potential of the copier. In another explanation, she maintained that she was cleaning out a drawer when she decided that she wanted to remember some of its contents. Following this account, Hill realized \\"she could more easily part with some of the objects she'd been collecting if she photocopied them as mementos.\\" Hill possessed \\"a longtime curiosity about the details of objects.\\", a respect she developed during the Great Depression, when, she recalled, \\"anything anybody had was it because there wasn't going to be another.\\" Hill began to experiment with the photocopier in 1973 by asking an attendant at a copy shop to scan various items for her. Later, she spent a weekend locked in IBM's New York offices to produce copies. About this, she said, \\"I got a lot of copies made and walked out on Monday morning when everyone came in.\\" In 1975, Hill published Slave Days, a book of 29 poems paired with photocopies of small household objects. In 1976, Hill published another novel, Impossible Dreams, illustrated by photocopies of 48 photographs taken by photographers such as Robert Doisneau and Ralph Gibson. Impossible Dreams is the product of Hill's efforts to create what she called a \\"stopped movie.\\" Hill's style of prose in this novel prompted one reviewer to call her writing \\"honest as kitchen knives but wielded in some dark alley.\\" Impossible Dreams earned Hill a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1976. Hill also used the photocopier to appropriate photographs in her work Men and Women in Sleeping Cars, a visual narrative sequence, in 1979. In 1977 on a flight from Paris to New York, Hill encountered designer Charles Eames and showed him some of the work she made on the copier. He formally introduced her to IBM, who presented Hill with an IBM Copier II on loan for two and a half years. With the copier installed in her home in Stonington, Connecticut, Hill experimented with techniques such as moving an object over the platen of the copier as a copy was being made, occasionally using brightly colored copier paper, and spooning extra quantities of toner into the machine. The IBM Copier II created many of the features which distinguished Hill's work by allowing for richer blacks and producing \\"flaws\\" in the print where the toner did not adhere to the paper. Hill embraced these flaws, stating, \\"The production of accidents is perhaps the feature of the copier which most endears it to the artist.\\" Hill did not view her prints as representations nor reproductions of physical objects, but she instead considered her prints as objects in and of themselves. On photocopies, Hill said, \\"A photocopy seems to me much more truthful to detail than a photograph.\\" She never enlarged nor shrank the scale of the objects she copied. Hill's work with the photocopier led her to treat the process of photocopying as a conversation with the photocopier. She presented the machine with a degree of autonomy, explaining, Hill also used the copier to negotiate the relationship between words and images. She strove to create \\"work in which the two elements fuse to become something other than either.\\" This effort is evident in A Swan: An Opera in Nine Chapters which creates a story through the combination of text and a series of photocopied prints of a dead swan. Her fascination with words and images further contributed to her efforts to create a universal symbol language, which was taught briefly to first-grade students of Deans Mill School in Stonington, Connecticut in the 1970s. In 1979, Hill published Letters to Jill: A catalogue and some notes on copying, which acts as a \\"jargon-free primer\\" on the photocopier as an artists' tool. For a profile in The New Yorker in 1980, Hill described her intimate relationship with and understanding of photocopies, explaining, \\"Copies are an international visual language, which talks to people in Los Angeles and people in Prague the same way. Making copies is very near to speaking.\\" In the 1980s, Hill committed to one of her greatest ambitions: photocopying the Palace of Versailles. She cited four reasons for this venture: 1) she considered Versailles to be simultaneously \\"self-centered\\" and \\"public-spirited\\"; 2) it shared connections between the United States and France, and she considered herself to be a citizen of both countries; 3) she wanted to \\"do something big\\"; 4) she wanted to see what \\"a modern device would make of something old.\\" Additionally, she explained, \\"I conceived the idea of photocopying the ch√¢teau of Versailles because, among other reasons, it is so well known through painting and photography. It gives me a dramatic opportunity to show the difference between those disciplines and that of copying. The great variety of subject matter would allow full range to the copier's artistic capacity within a single framework.\\" She copied a bellpull, cobblestones, and a pear tree, roots and live worms included, all of which were pulled from Versailles. Her work with Versailles further introduced her experimentation with colored toner, frottage, and photogravure. Hill intended to have several exhibitions of her Versailles work, including shows titled Weeds, Worms, Water and Popsicle Sticks, Stone and Iron, Walls and Words, and Lace and Glass.

At his own request he was buried in the Dominican church, S. Maria in Gradi, though his body was transferred, during the Sede Vacante, to the Cathedral of S. Lorenzo. The act was carried out by the Bishop, Archpriest and Canons of the Cathedral, anticipating that popular enthusiasm which began to see miracles at the dead pope's body might lead to a canonization. They preferred that the Cathedral should benefit rather than the Dominicans. The vacancy in the Holy See lasted two years, nine months and two days. Since the cardinals were absolutely unable to agree on one of themselves as a possible pope, they decided to follow a different sanctioned procedure for electing a pope, called the \\"Way of Compromise\\". Each of the cardinals, including Guillaume de Bray, signed a document entrusting the choice of a pope to a committee of six cardinals, providing that five of the six had to agree on the candidate for a successful election.

He was also one of thirteen cardinals who took part in the Conclave of July, 1276, which was held in Rome, where Innocent V had died. The Conclave began on 2 July and concluded on 11 July with the election of Cardinal Ottobono Fieschi of Genoa, who took the name Adrian V. King Charles of Sicily, the Senator of Rome, acted as governor of the Conclave. His administration of the Conclave was exceedingly rigorous, though unfair in his favoring the French faction. It is no surprise that one of his supporters was chosen pope. Adrian immediately ratified the peace treaty which had been worked out by the Genoese (or at least the pro-French Genoese) and King Charles.Gregorovius, 474-475. Ultimately King Charles' manipulations came to nothing, when Adrian died thirty nine-days later, on August 18. Before he died, however, he did one important act. He suspended the papal Constitution \\"Ubi Periculum\\", which had been drawn up by Pope Gregory X and ratified by the Second Council of Lyon in 1274. This constitution provided the rules and regulations for the operation of a Conclave. Adrian and the Cardinals agreed that it did not work well, and that it needed revisions. Cardinal Guillaume of S. Marco is specifically mentioned as not having been present, due to illness, at the discussions which lead to the suspension of \\"Ubi Periculum\\".A. Tomassetti, Bullarum, Diplomatum, et Privilegiorum Sanctorum Romanorum Pontificum editio Taurinensis Tomus IV (Turin 1859), pp. 37-38. Adrian was planning these revisions during a trip to Viterbo when he suddenly died. He had not been ordained, consecrated or crowned. The Conclave of September, 1276, in Viterbo, therefore, was the scene of considerable disorder both in the Roman Curia and in the townspeople. Once the disorders were quelled, the election was quick. The eleven Cardinals who were present agreed on Cardinal Peter of Lisbon, who became Pope John XXII.John P. Adams, Sede Vacante and Conclave of September, 1276. retrieved 02/05/2016. Cardinal Guillaume de Bray had been one of the episcopal examiners appointed by Pope Innocent V in the case of the election of Bishop Henri of Therouane, approval of which had been refused by the Archbishop of Reims under Pope Gregory X. An appeal had been lodged with Pope Gregory, and Cardinal Matteo Rosso Orsini had been assigned as Auditor. But Gregory had died in January, 1276, and the opponents to the appeal withdrew their objections, and so Cardinal Guillaume and his colleagues were appointed by Pope Innocent V to proceed to the examination of the election itself and the candidate. Then Innocent V died, and shortly after that Adrian V as well, and it was finally John XXI who accepted the examiners' judgment and ratified the election.E. Cadier, Registre de Jean XXI (Paris 1892), p. 4 no. 5 (17 October 1276). On 27 March, 1277, the election of an Archimandrite (Abbot) of the Basilian monastery of Cardona was confirmed by Pope John XXI on the recommendation of a committee of cardinals which included Guillaume of S. Marco.E. Cadier, Registre de Jean XXI (Paris 1892), p. 39 no. 121. There was no Guillelmum tituli S. Mariae presbyterum; he was G. tituli S. Marci. Reign of Nicholas III (1277-1281) Cardinal Guillaume de Bray was one of the cardinals who sat in Consistory at S. Peter's on 4 May 1278, when King Rudolf's ambassador, Fr. Conradus, O.Min., publicly ratified the agreements reached between the King and the late Pope Gregory X at Lausanne on 20 October 1275.J. Gay, Les registres de Nicolas III (Paris 1938), pp. 311-313, no. 688. On 3 February 1279, he was one of nine cardinals who subscribed the new Constitution for the Canons and Beneficiati of S. Peter's Basilica.J. Gay, Les registres de Nicolas III (Paris 1916), pp. 197-213, no. 517. On March 12, 1278, Pope Nicholas III (Orsini) created nine new cardinals, most of whom were not of the French or Angevin faction.Eubel, pp. 9-10. This was a challenge to King Charles I of Naples, who had been the principal political factor in Roman and Italian politics since 1265. Nicholas manipulated Charles into resigning the Senatorship, which Nicholas took into his own hands. He also required Charles to resign his post as Rector of Tuscany, where the Pope placed two of his nephews instead.H. D. Sedgwick, Italy in the Thirteenth Century II (Boston-New York 1912), pp. 37-102. David Abulafia, \\"The state of research. Charles of Anjou reassessed,\\" Journal of Medieval History 26 (2000), pp. 93‚Äì114. This ensured a continuous struggle during Nicholas' reign between Guelfs and Ghibbelines, French and Romans. It furthermore ensured that the future Conclave on his death would pit the Imperial party and French party against each other. Early in the year 1278, Cardinal Guillaume was a member of a committee of three cardinals who examined the canonical election and the personal character of Arnoldus de Villa, Bishop of Dax. The appointment was approved on their recommendation by Pope Nicholas.J. Gay, Les registres de Nicolas III (Paris 1898), p. 12-13, no. 51 (5 April 1278). A similar case, that of Giovanni Boccamazza, the Archbishop-elect of Monreale (and future cardinal), was handled in the summer of 1278.J. Gay, Les registres de Nicolas III (Paris 1898), p. 138-139, no. 120 (Viterbo, 13 August 1278). Boccamazza was a nephew of Cardinal Giacomo Savelli (Pope Honorius IV) On 18 March 1279, he and nine other cardinals subscribed two bulls for the benefit of the Monastery of Cluny,J. Gay, Les registres de Nicolas III (Paris 1898), pp. 173-174, nos. 458-459. and yet another on 7 May 1279.J. Gay, Les registres de Nicolas III (Paris 1898), pp. 179-180, no. 475. In the spring of 1279 he sat on a cardinalatial committee that advised the Pope on the disputed election to the See of Sorrento.J. Gay, Les registres de Nicolas III (Paris 1898), p. 219 no. 527 (22 June 1279). In September, he was a member of the committee that examined the election of William Wickwane, Archbishop-elect of York; a technical defect in the canonical election was found, and the election overturned. But Pope Nicholas then immediately provided (appointed) William Wickwane as Archbishop anyway.J. Gay, Les registres de Nicolas III (Paris 1898), pp. 230-231, no. 559 (19 September 1279). Another case concerned the Church of Vannes. When Bishop Guy died in October, 1270, the Cathedral Chapter split into two parties and engaged in a double election. Both sides appealed to Pope Gregory X, who appointed an examination committee. The case was still pending when Gregory died, and John XXI appointed another committee, of which Cardinal Guillaume de Bray was a member. But then Pope John died on 20 May 1277, and it was only on 12 December 1279, that the election was settled by Pope Nicholas III.J. Gay, Les registres de Nicolas III (Paris 1898), pp. 254-255, no. 595. Early in 1280 Cardinal Guillaume was Auditor (judge) in the case of a disputed election in the monastery of S. Launomarius Blesensis in the Diocese of Chartres.J. Gay, Les registres de Nicolas III (Paris 1938), pp. 278, no. 627 (5 April 1280). Election of Martin IV Pope Nicholas III died at his summer retreat at Soriano near Viterbo on 22 August 1280.Potthast, p. 1754. Guillaume de Bray was one of thirteen cardinals alive at the time of the Pope's death. His party, the French-Angevin, had sufficient votes to exclude any candidate they considered unfriendly, but the Roman party led by the Orsini was also in the same position. With a two-thirds vote required for a canonical election, a bitter struggle was inevitable.R. Sternfeld, \\"Das Konklave von 1280 und die Wahl Martins IV. (1281),\\" Mitteilungen des Instituts f√ºr √ñsterreichische Geschichtsforschung 21 (1910), pp. 1-53. The struggle began in Rome as soon as the death was known, with a revolt against the Orsini faction by a pro-Angevin faction headed by Riccardo Annibaldi. When the revolt failed, the Annibaldi fled the city, but then managed to get the people of Viterbo, where the Conclave was meeting, to revolt against their Podest√† (Governor), another Orsini papal nephew named Orso Orsini. Annibaldi became the \\"Protector of the Conclave\\", and managed the city for the benefit of the French faction. There were three Orsini cardinals, however, and with only a little support from two or three of their uncle's cardinals, the French faction could get nowhere. That situation continued for some five months. But suddenly, on 2 February 1281, the Conclave was invaded by a mob led by Riccardo Annibaldi and six of his captains, and the three Orsini cardinals were seized. Cardinal Latino Malabranca Orsini was released, but the other two were hauled off to imprisonment. Three days later, the late Pope's brother, Cardinal Giordano Orsini, was released and allowed to rejoin his colleagues in Conclave. But Cardinal Matteo Rosso Orsini was held until after the Conclave had concluded. Even with this degree of intimidation, though, it took the cardinals to agree on a French candidate, Cardinal Simon de Brion, who had been Papal Legate in France for more than a decade, and who had been the leading figure in bringing Charles of Anjou to Italy in the first place.Nikolaus Backes, Kardinal Simon de Brion (Breslau 1910). He chose to be called Martin IV.John P. Adams, The Sede Vacante of 1290-1281. retrieved 02/07/2016. He immediately approached the Roman leaders, hoping to be crowned at S. Peter's, according to tradition. He was flatly refused. The Romans wanted nothing to do with the puppet of Charles I and the Annibaldi. He would not be crowned in Viterbo, since the city was under Interdict and Excommunication for their actions against the Cardinals in Conclave. Martin IV and the Papal Curia therefore moved to Orvieto, where he was crowned in the Cathedral of S. Pietro on Sunday, March 23, 1281, and where he resided for the next fifteen months. On June 27, 1284, Martin IV was forced to leave Orvieto because of the hostility of Raynerius, the Captain of the People. On October 4, 1284, he arrived in Perugia, where he died on March 28, 1285. Death of Cardinal de Bray Under Martin IV (Simon de Brion), Cardinal Guillaume continued to be appointed to episcopal and abbatial examination committees. Early in 1282, he was one of the examiners of the election of the monk Jacobus de Roma to be abbot of S. Paul's Outside the Walls' but, before the examination was concluded, Jacobus resigned the election, and the Pope appointed Bartholomeo, Abbot of S. Gregorio in Clivo Scauri instead.Members of the French School at Rome (editors), Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), p. 40 no. 105 (6 March 1282). He was also a member of a committee of cardinals who had been appointed by Pope Nicholas IV to examine the election of an Abbess of the monastery of S. Victorino in Benevento, but then Nicholas died and the examination continued under Martin IV, but Cardinal Guillaume of S. Marco died before the final papal decision, which was given on 23 November 1282.Members of the French School at Rome (editors), Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), p. 123 no. 297. Cardinal Guillaume de Bray died in Orvieto on 29 April 1282,recorded in the Necrology of the Church of Meaux: Paravicini- Bagliani, Testamenti, p. 35. His funeral monument also has an inscription which states OBIIT‚Ä¢TERCIO‚Ä¢KL‚Ä¢MAII. and was buried in the Church of the Dominicans, with a monument designed by Arnolfo di Cambio. The inscription gives the Cardinal credit for mathesis, lex et decreta, and poesis (mathematics, Canon and civil law, poetry).

Causton was a gentleman of the chapel royal under Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I. Nothing is known of his parentage, but it is possible that he is identical with a Thomas Causton who was living about the same date at Oxted in Surrey. This individual was the son of William Causton of Orpington, by Katherine Banister, and was married to Agnes Polley of Shoreham. Their son William (d. 1638) had a numerous family, who lived at Oxted until late in the seventeenth century. On 29 Oct. 1558 Mary wrote to the mayor and aldermen of London in favour of Thomas Causton, ‚Äòone of the gentlemen of the chappell,‚Äô requesting that he should be admitted into the freedom of the city. In 1560 he contributed some music to John Day's rare ‚ÄòCertain Notes, set forth in four and three parts, to be sung at the Morning, Communion, and Evening Prayer.‚Äô The same publisher's ‚ÄòWhole Psalmes in Foure Partes‚Äô (1563) also contains twenty-seven compositions by Causton. A Venite and service by him have been reprinted in the ‚ÄòEcclesiologist,‚Äô and a Te Deum and Benedictus in score are preserved in the British Museum (Add. MS. 31226). He died on 28 Oct. 1569, and was succeeded at the Chapel Royal by Richard Farrant. Modern scholars believe Causton was only included in John Day's collection because of his personal connection to the publisher. He was described as \\"earnest but amaterish\\" by Gustave Reese and as \\"As a composer [...] no more than an enthusiastic amateur\\" by Edmund Fellowes. Day published every piece by Causton, with the exception of his Yield unto God, but no posthumous volume as would be a expected of a significant composer. This has been taken by scholars to show that Causton worked for Day as a script corrector or compiler. He is not the same as the Thomas Causton reported by Foxe as having been put to death in 1555.

The purpose of the chair is to aid industry workers and medical surgeons who had to work for long hours standing. As of February 2016, it is specially designed for medical surgeons, allowing them to sit during physically demanding surgical operations which reduces fatigue in surgeons.  History  Patents for similar wearable devices dates back to more than four decades which has since been expired. The original patent for the invention was first made by Darcy Robert Bonner in 1977 which was later granted as D249,987 in October 1978. In 2015, Swiss engineers came up with a similar product called Noonee which is a hydraulic-powered exoskeleton made of a titanium frame. Noonee was tested on workers of German car manufacturing company, Audi.  Function  The device while worn, makes the angle of ankle and knee stable to enable a standing orientation such that the knees moderately bent but without applying any effort on the legs and without exerting pressure on the joints. The body coercion gets shared out to the shin and thigh, minimizing the muscle fatigue. The device can be locked into unassociated positions for each limb to permit the user to stand in a comfortable way. The designers believe that the device is perfect for medical surgeons who need to stand for long hours during operations.

They were formed by students from Grand Ledge High School and their name derived from the nickname of their bass player, Gary Richey, who because of his Native American heritage was referred to as \\"Tonto\\" by his friends at school. The group had several hits in the Southern Michigan region in 1966 and 1967. By the late 1960s group was being courted by major record labels, when the prospect of the Vietnam War draft caused two members to leave the band, resulting in the group's breakup. The intervening years have witnessed a revival of interest in the band's music amongst garage rock enthusiasts. Tonto and the Renegades are now best known for their song \\"Little Boy Blue\\", which is today regarded as a garage rock classic. In 2012 Tonto and The Renegades were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends online Hall of Fame. History =Origins= Tonto and the Renegades were founded in 1964 by four grade school students in Grand Ledge, Michigan.  Though the band is sometimes referred to \\"Tonto & the Renegades\\" and their single for \\"Little Boy Blue\\" used an ampersand rather than an \\"and\\" in their moniker, the name painted on their bass drum logo was \\"Tonto and the Renegades\\", indicating that it was the intended name of the band. The Michigan Rock and Roll Hall of fame article uses that name in their article, so we have chosen to do so here. When the band was formed, all of the band's four original members Tom Kirby, Terry Slocum, Bill Ford, and Gary Richey, were 8th graders at Grand Ledge High School (though a high school, it had an eighth grade class). Two years earlier in 1962, while their drummer Kirby was fourteen and in 6th grade, growing up in a subdivision just outside Grand Ledge, he expressed interest to his parents that he wanted to learn to play percussion, they bought him a drum set and arranged for him to take lessons from a retired music professor who had retired from Michigan State University. Kirby and his older brother Randy played in his first band, the Grandaires. The Grandaires repertoire consisted primarily of covers of Chuck Berry, Ray Charles, and other hits of the day, but they broke up shortly thereafter. Terry Slocum, who grew up on a farm, started out playing a clarinet which his mother, a fan of Pete Fountain, bought him. Slocum became a fan of rock and roll after hearing his brother play his collection of rockabilly, R&B;, and early Motown records. A pivotal moment for Slocum was when he watched the Beatles perform on the Ed Sullivan Show which convinced him to start playing in a rock band. He took his clarinet to Marshall Music in Lansing and traded it for a guitar the following day. His father tried to discourage him from playing the new instrument, claiming that he would never master it, but he persisted, spending most of his spare time practicing in his room, intent on proving his father wrong. Bill Ford grew up on the outskirts of Grad Ledge next to Highway 43. He began playing guitar in 1962, following brief spell of attempting to learn the drums. He took guitar lessons, and improved to the point where he was able to teach guitar at the Zvonar Music Studios in Charlotte, Michigan. Like Slocum, Ford remembers being \\"completely blown away listening to the music of the Beatles\\". He did not yet have an amplifier, so he compensated by plugging his guitar into a tape recorder owned by his uncle, but ended up blowing out the speakers. He then saved up to buy and amplifier. Kirby, Slocum, and Ford started practicing together informally during their eighth grade year and played in a number of talent shows. They added fellow schoolmate Bob Dick on and later that year and named their act the Henchmen. =Entrance of \\"Tonto\\"= Eventually Dick left the Henchmen and they added Gary Richey to their lineup on guitar and vocals. Richey was classmate of Kirby, Slocum, and Ford at Grand Ledge High, and because he was of Native American heritage, Richey had acquired the nickname \\"Tonto\\" at school. Like the other members of the Henchmen, he was an enthusiast of the Beatles and the British Invasion bands. And, like Kirby, he also grew up in a subdivision on the outskirts of town. Before joining the Henchmen, Richey owned a small tape recorder on which he would record his voice singing along to the Beatles' songs. His parents were supportive of his interest in music, and bought him a guitar and paid for lessons. After two months of learning the basics of the instrument, Richey was invited into the Henchmen. Richey's parents were eager to make their home basement available and it became the Henchmen's rehearsal space. The band practiced there daily after school. Once they began to land gigs, Richey's father offered to become the group's manager. Not long after Richey joined the band, they decided to change their name to a moniker suggested by one of their classmates at Grand Ledge High, Toby Bates, who was also a member of the local group the Beaux Gens, who would later record \\"She Was Mine\\". The name he suggested was Tonto and the Renegades, which mixed Richey's nickname along with \\"Renegades\\". Through Richey's cousin, the band enlisted the services of a young artist named Dennis Preston to design a cartoon logo of an Indian carrying a hatchet to paint on the bass drumhead of Tom Kirby's Ludiwg oyster pearl drum set. Upon entering the group Richey became their leader. Richey and Slocum sang most of the band's songs, and unlike most of their local competitors, this group was adept at harmonies. Their first live performance as Tonto and the Renegades as was at the Grand Ledge High School Senior Prom held in the spring of 1964. At the show, Kirby's older brother Randy came up from the audience and sang Ray Charles' \\"What'd I Say\\", a number that they had performed in the Grandaires. The band started to become popular in the Lansing area and was booked almost every weekend. None of the band members yet had members drivers' licenses, so in the band's early days Richey's parents usually provided transportation to gigs. The band members bought most of their equipment at Marshall Music, located on S. Washington Avenue in downtown Lansing. It was a favorite hangout for the area's young musicians, and most bought their instruments there. The store also sold records including local 45's issued by the teen bands in and around the Lansing area. Bill Lewis, who worked at the store, helped the band with their gear and quickly became friends with the band's members. Tonto and The Renegades became a regular fixture at the Sceen, a teen nightclub located about twelve miles from Grand Ledge at the intersection of Michigan Highways 43 and 50. The building had formerly been a motel before owner Don Tenfry gutted it and converted it to a music and dance venue. The facility, known for having good acoustics, had four stages and a large outside patio. The Screen attracted large teenage crowds from surrounding small farming communities such as Woodbury, Sunfield, Muliken, Needmore. According to Billford, \\"It was an absolute blast playing there\\". Top Michigan bands such as the Bossmen, the Ones, and the Woolies played there regularly. =Expanded lineup and recording= Eventually Gary Richey switched to playing bass, augmenting Terry Slocum and Bill Ford on guitars and Tom Kirby on drums. Tonto and The Renegades established a good working relationship with Don Trefry at the screen and he became their booking agent. Tenfry was able to land numerous gigs for the band, which included venues such as the Hullabaloo in Lansing, Daniel's Den in Saginaw, and the Club Ponytail in Harbor Springs. The Club Ponytail had previously been a speakeasy during Prohibition and was reputed to have had connections to Al Capone. Tonto and The Renegades appeared there on several occasions, opening for popular acts such as the Beach Boys and Mitch Ryder and The Detroit Wheels. The band's motto printed on their business card was \\"Beat Music for all occasions\\". In 1966, the band decided to add a keyboard player providing them with the flexibility to play a greater variety of material, including popular Motown songs. Bands played original numbers, but were also expected to play covers of popular hits of the day to satisfy dance audiences. Gary Richey discovered keyboardist Jeff Keast, and he was added to the band's roster before they recorded their first single. Keast was not from Grand Ledge and attended O'Rafferty Catholic High School in Lansing. He was a capable musician and could play both the organ and piano at the same time while singing and dancing on stage. Don Trefry arranged for the band to record its first single \\"Little Boy Blue\\", written by Terry Slocum, b/w \\"I Knew This Thing Would Happen\\" at Dave Kalmbach's Great Lakes Recording Studio in Sparta, Michigan, which was released in late 1966. The band rehearsed extensively in the Richey's basement in preparation for the recording. Kalmbach owned Fenton Records and offered his customers the option of either releasing their singles on his label or designing their own vanity label. Trefry financed the recording which would be released on his own Sound Of The Sceen label, named for his club, the Screen. The group picked up the first batch of records, packed in a cardboard box, at the American Record Pressing plant in Owosso. They distributed them to Marshall Music and all the record stores in Grand Ledges, and then drove to various radio stations bringing copies to DJs in the hopes of receiving airplay. In the mid-1960s, it was still possible for local bands to get their songs played on AM radio stations and DJs still had the power to do organize their own programming. Both sides of the single got extensive airplay, especially at WJIM-AM out of Lansing, which was at the time the most popular Top 40 station in Southwest Michigan. Station disc jockey Eric O. was a backer, and the band did a number of short promos at the station to push the 45. \\"I Knew This Thing Would Happen\\" was the bigger hit of the two at the time, but the fuzz-drenched \\"Little Boy Blue\\" would later become a favorite of garage rock enthusiasts, and is now regarded as a classic in the genre. The success of the single not only increased the band's popularity, but allowed them to charge more money for gigs. =Collaboration with Dick Wagner= In 1967, Jeff Keast left the group after just one year. Keast's parents disapproved of his involvement in rock and roll which they considered \\"the devil's music.\\" Upon his departure Keast recommended a fellow O'Rafferty Hgh School classmate, Dave Pung, to be his replacement on keyboards. Dick Wagner, who Tonto and the Renegades had befriended on the numerous occasions his band, the Bossmen, and they had played at the Screen. Wagner, who was trying to put a new band together, the Frost, was also working with other groups as a songwriter and producer. He had been impressed with Tonto and the Renegades' single, and told them he had several songs that would be perfect for them, and indicated that he would like to produce their next record. He went to Gary Richey's house and played several of the songs for the band on acoustic guitar. The band particularly liked \\"Anytime You Want Some Lovin'\\" which became their choice for the A-side of their second single. The band's initial choice for the B-side was Wagner's \\"First Day Of May\\", but Wagner decided to save that song for his new band the Frost. Tonto and The Renegades then settled on another Wagner composition \\"The Easy Way Out\\" for B-side. Manager Don Trefry again financed the recording session at Dave Kalmbach's studio in Sparta, but this time Dick Wagner produced with Kalmbach engineering the session. Wagner wanted to incorporate horns on the recordings. To save costs, drummer Tom Kirby asked Jerry Jensen, the band director at Grand Ledge High School, to recommend horn players from the school band and he singled out two underclassmen, Jim Hall and Ernie Morrow, as the best candidates for the session. The two joined the band in the Richey's basement for rehearsals, while Wagner arranged the horn parts on the spot. Wagner's more sophisticated and experiential production techniques required more recording time and the band spent a whole eight-hour day in the studio to complete the sessions. Richey had come up with well-rehearsed bass parts for both songs, but Wagner asked him to try new ones instead. After trying the new lines, Wagner changed his mind relented, feeling that Richey's initial ones worked best. Wagner contributed a fuzz-drench guitar line to \\"Anytime You Want Some Lovin'\\" and brought in Donny Hartman, a fellow member from his new band, Frost, to play on the track. Wagner eventually went back to Richey's initial bass line when his new idea didn't pan out, and also brought in Donny Hartman, his new Frost bandmate, to play on the track. Hartman added harmonica to the final recorded version of the song; a fine mid-tempo rock ballad featuring gorgeous band harmonies. Hartman added harmonica to the final recorded version of the song, which displayed the band's rich harmonies. The second single, like the first, was released on Trefry's Sound Of The Sceen label and both sides became hits the Lansing area, with WJIM providing a big push of the record. Tonto and The Renegades made their first television appearance on Swing Lively, a teen music program on Channel 6 in Lansing. =Interest of major labels, Vietnam draft, and breakup= All of the group's members graduated from high school in June 1968. Just as national record labels began to express interest in the band and their latest single, the prospect of the Vietnam War draft became a pressing issue. After graduating from high school, Bill Ford was the first band member to be targeted by the Selective Service. An instructor at Lansing Community College convinced him to enroll in full-time classes there to receive a 2-A deferment. He later transferred to Michigan State University where he earned a B.A. degree in political science. After Ford's departure, Tonto and The Renegades returned to a four-member lineup. Terry Slocum got married in 1968, and he was therefore able to receive a 3-A draft deferment. With the success of the new single, the band was earning $1,000 per night and receiving offers from major record companies such as Capitol, Columbia, Decca, and the U.S.A. label who had recently signed Saginaw's the Cherry Slush. Gary Richey and Tom Kirby knew they were also facing the prospect draft but preferred to concentrate on the record deal offers coming in for the band. Columbia's offer was especially generous with the promise of a $10,000 advance, a national tour, and an album to be recorded after the tour. After Tom Kirby received his draft notice in 1969, he left the band and quickly volunteered for the Navy to avoid field combat, but still ended up serving three consecutive tours of duty in Vietnam aboard the Destroyer U.S.S. Hollister. He saw action in the South China Sea, the Gulf of Tonkin, and many of the rivers and canals along the Vietnam coast. Gary Richey was drafted soon after Kirby, was rejected and classified 4-F because he suffered from eczema a skin disease. The band began to disintegrate after Kirby's departure. Tonto and the Renegades broke up in 1969. =Later developments and legacy= After the demise of Tonto and the Renegades, Gary Richey and Terry Slocum played together briefly with a band called Headstone, and shortly after Richey joined another group named Thanx. Tom Kirby returned from Viet Nam in 1971 and married a woman from Grand Ledge. He eventually became a systems analyst for the Department of Information Technology at the office of the Michigan Secretary of State. Kirby later divorced but remarried and is now retired. In 2009 he started a two-man band with Jim Hall called Trail's End, and they often play at Mija's Grey Wolf Inn in Grand Ledge. After leaving music in the 1970s, Richey became a construction worker, but was injured on the job, and is now on living on disability in Lansing. Slocum briefly joined the armed forces, but after returning left Michigan, and moved to Memphis, then Florida. He has continued to play music over the years on guitar in several rock bands, as well as blues. On one occasion, he played at a show with Buddy Guy at a roadhouse in Clarksdale, Mississippi. After graduating from MSU, Bill Ford got married and moved to Wisconsin, entered law school at University of Wisconsin at Madison. To pay tuition, he sold the guitar and amplifier he had use with Tonto and the Renegades. He worked as an attorney for 30 years in Wisconsin and retired in 2009. Although Tonto and the Renegades broke up in 1969, the subsequent reissues of their songs in the intervening years have sparked a renewal of interest and the band‚Äîgaining them at last a worldwide following. Their song \\"Little Boy Blue\\" was re-issued on the Back from the Grave, Volume 4 (LP), and Back from the Grave, Volume 2 (CD). All four of the recordings made by Tonto and The Renegades at the Great Lakes Recording Studio in Sparta, Michigan, were included in the 2-CD Scream Loud!!! The Fenton Story, released in 2007.

Salt Lake received its name due to the naturally occurring salt at the lake shore, a by-product of the alkaline soils which surround the lake. It is the only alkaline lake in Minnesota and its water is approximately one- third the salinity of sea water. Salt grasses grow along the shore and in the lake's water. The site is one of the most popular birdwatching sites in Minnesota. One hundred and forty one different species of birds have been identified by birders in the vicinity of the lake. Sago pondweed and brine shrimp in the lake attract large flocks of waterfowl and shorebirds. Frequently seen birds at Salt Lake include avocets, willets and ducks such as the canvasback, gadwall, and shoveler. Like other prairie basin lakes, Salt Lake has dry and wet cycles in which the lake will periodically dry out completely. During dry years, exposed wetland mud flats are streaked in white layers of salt.

The title track, \\"Alice\\", is one of De Gregori's best known songs, and has become a classic. Reception The historian Cesare Grazioli writes that De Gregori became the acknowledged \\"prince\\" of songwriters, inspired by Bob Dylan, a melancholy narrative voice expressing the doubt, ambiguity and human crisis of the times, with Alice no lo sa his first album. The album gained for De Gregori an undeserved reputation for being obscure. The album indicated De Gregori's innovativeness: the title song, \\"Alice\\", broke with the past with its elegant lyrics and visionary quality, still esteemed a generation later. The album was not an immediate commercial hit, but it had great artistic value with its evocative poetry and sophisticated melodies, and it proved to be the first of a series of masterpieces of popular music. Mariano Prunes, reviewing the album on AllMusic.com, notes that while only the title track is recognised as a classic, several other songs deserve to be. The album, writes Prunes, is influenced by Leonard Cohen, and \\"Marianna al Bivio\\" actually refers to Cohen's songs \\"Suzanne\\" and \\"So Long, Marianne\\", the lyrics throughout taking centre stage rather than, as was de rigueur in Italy at the time, making the singing openly personal or political.

Career Born in Glasgow, but based during much of his professional career in Hoxton, London, Ross made his professional debut in March 1915 with a points win over Joe Clark at flyweight. He won six of his first ten fights and in August 1916 faced Sid Shields for the vacant Scottish flyweight title, winning on points over 20 rounds. In March 1917 he fought a draw with Louis Ruddick at the Holborn Stadium. In November he beat Johnny Hughes over 20 rounds, and followed that in January 1918 with a win over Digger Stanley. He beat Stanley again in April, his opponent being disqualified in the sixth round, but lost to Tommy Noble on points in October. In June 1919 he challenged for Noble's British bantamweight title at the National Sporting Club. Ross dominated the fight, and Noble's corner threw in the towel midway through the tenth round, giving Ross the British title. Ross faced Eug√®ne Criqui in September 1919, the Frenchman knocking him out in the fifteenth round. Three months later he challenged for Charles Ledoux's European bantamweight title at the Cirque de Paris, but lost after retiring in the twelfth and final round while well behind. Only two weeks after the fight with Ledoux, he faced Joe Symonds in Plymouth. He fought a draw with Robert Dastillon in January 1920. After losing his next two fights he put together a run of wins which included defeats of Alf Goodwin, Sid Whatley, Marcel Lepreux, and former British champion Bill Beynon. The run came to an end when he was disqualified for hitting low against Dastillon in Paris in October. In 1921 he beat Beynon and Dastillon, but lost to Symonds in October. In 1922 he travelled to Australia for a series of fights, but won only one (against Silvino Jamito). After three and a half years out of the ring he returned in December 1925, losing three fights before finally retiring in 1926.

Informally, it can be seen as the projection on the divergence-free vector fields. It is used in particular to eliminate both the pressure term and the divergence-free term in the Stokes equations and Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. Definition =By pseudo-differential approach= For vector fields \\\\mathbf u (in any dimension n \\\\geq 2), the Leray projection \\\\mathbb P is defined by : \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathbf u) = \\\\mathbf u - abla \\\\Delta^{-1} ( abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u). This definition must be understood in the sense of pseudo- differential operators: its matrix valued Fourier multiplier m(\\\\xi) is given by : m(\\\\xi)_{kj} = \\\\delta_{kj}-\\\\frac{\\\\xi_k \\\\xi_j}{ \\\\vert \\\\xi \\\\vert^2},\\\\quad 1 \\\\leq k,j \\\\leq n. Here, \\\\delta is the Kronecker delta. Formally, it means that for all \\\\mathbf u \\\\in \\\\mathcal S(\\\\R^n)^n, one has : \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathbf u)_k(x) = \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi)^{n/2}} \\\\int_{\\\\R^n} \\\\left( \\\\delta_{kj}-\\\\frac{\\\\xi_k \\\\xi_j}{ \\\\vert \\\\xi \\\\vert^2}\\\\right) \\\\widehat{\\\\mathbf u}_j(\\\\xi) \\\\, e^{i \\\\xi \\\\cdot x}\\\\, \\\\mathrm d\\\\xi,\\\\quad 1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n where \\\\mathcal S(\\\\R^n) is the Schwartz space. We use here the Einstein notation for the summation. =By Helmholtz‚ÄìLeray decomposition= One can show that a given vector field \\\\mathbf u can be decomposed as : \\\\mathbf u = abla q + \\\\mathbf v, \\\\quad \\\\text{with} \\\\quad abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf v = 0. Different than the usual Helmholtz decomposition, the Helmholtz‚ÄìLeray decomposition of \\\\mathbf u is unique (up to an additive constant for q ). Then we can define \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathbf u) as : \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathbf u) = \\\\mathbf v. Properties The Leray projection has the following properties: # The Leray projection is a projection: \\\\mathbb P [\\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathbf u)] = \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathbf u) for all \\\\mathbf u \\\\in \\\\mathcal S(\\\\R^n)^n. # The Leray projection is a divergence-free operator: abla \\\\cdot [\\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathbf u)] = 0 for all \\\\mathbf u \\\\in \\\\mathcal S(\\\\R^n)^n. # The Leray projection is simply the identity for the divergence-free vector fields: \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathbf u) = \\\\mathbf u for all \\\\mathbf u \\\\in \\\\mathcal S(\\\\R^n)^n such that abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u =0. # The Leray projection vanishes for the vector fields coming from a potential: \\\\mathbb P( abla \\\\phi) = 0 for all \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal S(\\\\R^n). Application to Navier‚ÄìStokes equations The (incompressible) Navier‚ÄìStokes equations are : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} - u\\\\,\\\\Delta \\\\mathbf{u} + ( \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\cdot abla ) \\\\mathbf{u} + abla p = \\\\mathbf f : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u} = 0 where \\\\mathbf{u} is the velocity of the fluid, p the pressure, u > 0 the viscosity and \\\\mathbf f the external volumetric force. Applying the Leray projection to the first equation and using its properties leads to : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} + u\\\\, \\\\mathbb S (\\\\mathbf{u}) + \\\\mathbb B(\\\\mathbf{u},\\\\mathbf{u}) = \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathbf f) where : \\\\mathbb S (\\\\mathbf{u}) = - \\\\mathbb P(\\\\Delta \\\\mathbf{u}) is the Stokes operator and the bilinear form \\\\mathbb B is defined by : \\\\mathbb B (\\\\mathbf{u},\\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\mathbb P[ ( \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\cdot abla ) \\\\mathbf{v}]. In general, we assume for simplicity that \\\\mathbf f is divergence free, so that \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathbf f) = \\\\mathbf f ; this can always be done, with the term \\\\mathbf f - \\\\mathbb P(\\\\mathbf f) being added to the pressure.

They are an advocacy organization which has been assisting African American Fire Fighters since 1970. Having formed an outreach with members of the Fire Fighting profession statewide, the membership is over 300 and still growing. Origins Formed in 1970, it is affiliated with the IABPFF and became the first minority group to win a discrimination lawsuit over hiring in 1973. This increased the number of minorities in the Baltimore fire service subsequently paving the legal pathway for other organizations to follow. The purpose of the Vulcan Blazers is to service the community-at-large including social issues, schools, agencies, private and corporate entities and to mentor youth in fire service careers. History African-Americans have been a part of the history of the Baltimore City Fire Department dating to Smokestack Hardy and the SHC Auxiliaries agitating the Mayor for them being made permanent and paid firemen in 1949. At the start of WWII firefighters enlisted en masse and the fire auxiliaries were utilized to fight fires in Baltimore. Hardy was the first certified as a firefighter and when the returning troops reclaimed the trucks, he continued to assist. Hardy was mustered out as too old for the army in 1943. In 1953, the first civil service class to include African-Americans was inducted into the fire academy. Many of the auxiliaries were over the age limits by the time of that first class but Charles Miller, Charles L. Scott and Roy Parker went on to serve as full firefighters for the city of Baltimore. In the first class of Auxiliaries to be paid were Lee D. Babb, Cicero Baldwin, Ernest H. Barnes, Louis Harden, Earl C. Jones, Carl E. McDonald, George C.W. McKnight, Jr., Charles T. Miller, Roy Parker, Charles L. Scott and Lindsay Washington. Scott scored no.1 on the civil service list to be hired, out of 48 taking and passing the civil service exam and physical. Hardy and the auxiliaries continued to respond to forth alarms, setting up ladders and assisting the firefighters. Until then, the Fire Department had been described by the black auxiliaries as a \\"private club\\" for white males only. The reality for the new firefighters was bleak, blacks were admitted to the Fire Department but they had to deal with segregated beds, toilets and washrooms. In many cases they were not allowed to use the same kitchen spoons or mugs, drink coffee from the coffeepot or read the newspapers bought by 'community chest' funds. Some firehouses had \\"Reserved\\" (for Colored People) signs over tables in the kitchens, on beds and a commode. It wasn't just in Baltimore that these incidents took place, but it was a consistent theme wherever blacks were integrated into firehouse life. In 1954, Firefighter Jack Johnson becomes the first to receive the fire departments Meritorious Service Award. In 1959, the first black promoted to the rank of Engine Engineer, Herman Williams, was not allowed to operate the apparatus to a fire. He was later promoted to Chief of the BCFD by Mayor Curt Schmoke in 1992. 1960 saw the first black to be promoted to Lieutenant, James Thomas had earlier achieved the rank of Fire Pump Operator. In the BCFD, Blacks were not allowed join the local union until eight years after they broke the color line. With the full union membership of local 734 set against inducting African-Americans, plus the departmental rules stipulated that you couldn't have any other representation than local 734, blacks determined that they would have representation. As social associations were allowed, The Social Association of Fire Fighters (SAFF) began as firefighters meeting at the house of James Crockett, a member of the third fire class. The SAFF, led by Charles R. Thomas visited the Vulcan Society in NYC who counseled legal action; subsequently, with the help of the law firm Brown Allen and Watts, Labor Leader A. Philip Randolph, The NAACP, The Urban League and some white supporters, the AFL-CIO forced the Local 734 Union to bring the \\"Negro Issue\\" to the floor of a general membership meeting. Blacks were denied membership in the Union until 1961 and were allowed to join only after the Union charged them a 'fee' to get in. These 'fees' later were litigated and found constitutional. In 2003 seven of the last remaining recruits who served at 36 Engine House on Edmondson Avenue got together to remember the firehouse as a place where history was made. It used to be the city's fire training school and it was where 10 men broke the color line to become Baltimore's first African-American firefighters. The only member of the 3rd class of black recruits not there on that day was Chief Herman Williams. All had been members of the Vulcan blazers, the incorporated successor to the SAFF. The city officially renamed Engine Company 36 on Edmondson Avenue and Bentalou Street - where for 22 years Thomas served in uniform - the Charles R. Thomas Sr. Engine Company. It is the third city firehouse named after a black firefighter and the second after a Vulcan Blazer. In 2015 the City Council of Baltimore passed resolutions CR-7573 thru CR-7587 thanking these black firefighters for their service to the city and cited their membership in the Vulcan Blazers with the following proclamations - CR 7575 President Dixon, All Members A City Council RESOLUTION congratulating Charles L. Scott(among others) on being one of the 1st African American Fireman(men) to serve the residents of Baltimore City and the Vulcan Blazers.pg.20-22 The city Council had previously in 2007 recognized the Vulcans with a resolution congratulating them on 35 years of service to the city - CR 1552 President Dixon, All Members A City Council RESOLUTION congratulating Vulcan Blazers, Inc. on the celebration of its 35 Anniversary.pg.16 IABPFF In 1969 minority firefighters from all over the country went to NYC to attend the inaugural meeting of the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters. The following year in Hartford, Connecticut at the first IABPFF convention the SAFF leaders were present and were instrumental in forming that organization; when they returned to Baltimore they incorporated as the Vulcan Blazers. The first order of business was to find a legal team to fight the harassment they experienced in the firehouses along with the discriminatory promotion practices of the BFCD in court. In 1971 four members of the Vulcan Blazers, supported by the organization, brought a racial discrimination lawsuit in the Baltimore Federal Court against the BCFD. They alleged that the hiring and promotion practices of the department were discriminatory against black firefighters. The trial was seen as an important test of federal affirmative action policies As a result, promotions to the rank of Battalion Chief (17 of 44 promotions) and other titles was ordered halted until the diversity goals stipulated in the judges order were met. The federal court trial Judge, Joseph H.Young, found there was a pattern of racial discrimination in the city's Fire Department. He ordered affected African-American firefighters be given promotions after years of bias by BFCD against them. On conclusion of the lawsuit in the spring of 1973, the BCFD had appointed an African American Fire Chief and promoted several officers to all ranks as high as assistant chief. Tax exemption denied In 1989 the association protested the Amusement Park tax being levied on the association by the city of Baltimore and state of Maryland after the Fraternal Hall was audited and found to have underpaid taxes on the gross receipts. The Appeals Court found for the City of Baltimore but after an audit by the federal tax authorities (IRS) the organization was granted protection under 501c5 of the tax code. The Blazers again applied for and was granted an exemption from the federal income tax requirement. The organization was found to be a \\"Labor, agricultural, or horticultural organization\\" within the allowances of 26 U.S.C. ¬ß 501(c)(5). Subsequently, it also was exempted from paying the State income tax requirement. Other notable Vulcan Blazers In 2007, following disagreements over promotions made at the Fire Academy with the Chief of department, the Vulcan Blazers publicly called for his replacement by civil authorities. A trainee firefighter, Racheal M. Wilson, had died during a live burn exercise earlier in the year and the firefighters union was not happy with the way Chief Goodwin ran his executive staff appointments. With questions of safety and the appearance that the diverse classes were being subjected to harsher regimens than previous classes of all-white recruits the Blazers stood in front in calling for changes at the top. Immediately after the incident some training officers were disciplined and the head of the academy was replaced. Following accusations of cheating by black candidates on the 2007 exams for Lieutenant and Captain positions a Title VII lawsuit was filed and the firefighters union, a defendant along with the BFCD and the City, was dropped as a defendant before the case was consolidated by the Judge. The decision included statements made by Henry Burris, Pres of the Vulcan Blazers in the press alleging that the rumors that there had been cheating were racially motivated by white officers, the union and Chief Goodwin. In 2011 summary judgement dismissing those discrimination charges was granted,pg.48 the final disposition indicated that because their earlier scores were lower these blacks could not have achieved the highest scores on the tests without cheating. In December 2011 Lloyd Carter, the former head diversity officer of the BCFD sued the city on grounds of racial discrimination over his reassignment. Carter claims to have been subjected to un-warranted internal investigation and was suing on grounds of racial discrimination. He was supported in this suit by the Blazers who also complained to the U.S. Justice Department which rebuffed the request to join the suit. Carter was also a past president of the Vulcan Blazers organization and was turned down by the court. The Blazers have also sued over low minority hiring and systemic bias and a similar lawsuit filed by minority police officers in 2009 against the City of Baltimore resulted in a $4.3 Million dollar settlement over charges it had racially discriminatory practices. It was largest Title VII settlement by a municipality hi-lighting the lack of diversity in the hiring practices of the police and fire depts. on November 14, 2014, Baltimore fire safety officer Lt. James Bethea died of smoke inhalation after falling through a floor at a vacant rowhouse adjacent to a fire scene. He was trapped for hours before an off-duty firefighter saw his car outside the now quieted fire and called for help. Lt. Bethea was a lifelong member of the Vulcan Blazers and active in the community. As a result of the LODD, department head Niles Ford said the BFCD would consider additional policy changes, including requiring that safety officers work in pairs. He was a member of the BFCD class of 1973 that resulted as ordered by the court to settle a discrimination lawsuit brought by the Vulcan Blazers alleging racial discrimination in hiring and promotion. Promotions Burlando Building, National Fire Academy In 2013 the BCFD promoted Captain Charline B. Stokes to Battalion Chief for Community Outreach. Stokes is the first African American female to attain the rank of Battalion Chief in the 154-year history of the Baltimore City Fire Department. Fire Chief Niles R. Ford, an African-American, is the current head of the BCFD. More strides in advancing diversity in 2015 came with the elevation of Twana Allen, the first black female promoted to the post of Fire Lieutenant at Baltimore County Fire Department. Recently, the department posted guidelines for a new physical test. For that, The IAFF(International Association of Fire Fighters) and IAFC(International Association of Fire Chiefs) got together with 10 leading fire departments and unions through the FEMA program \\"Fire Service Joint Labor Management Wellness/Fitness Initiative\\". Together, they came up with a new test called the \\"IAFF/IAFC Candidate Physical Ability Test\\" (CPAT). Based on those changes they posted a new vision for the BCFD regarding diversity. \\"Communities are increasingly diverse and firefighters are continually challenged to operate in multi-cultural environments. The goal of the CPAT is to identify individuals who are physically qualified to perform the job of firefighter. At the same time, the CPAT seeks to eliminate artificial barriers to a fire department‚Äôs broader goal of developing a properly trained and physically capable workforce whose members reflect the diversity of the community. Diversity is also achieved by actively recruiting qualified men and women candidates from all racial and ethnic backgrounds for careers in the fire service.\\" References External links Herman Williams, Jr. Video Category:African-American firefighting organizations Category:African-American history in Baltimore Category:African-American organizations Category:Ethnic fraternal orders in the United States Category:Firefighters associations in the United States Category:History of Baltimore ","title":"Vulcan Blazers"},{"id":"49341364","text":"Zhang Kehui (, February 1928) is a Chinese politician.

In 2016 Shaul married fellow wrestler Matthew Rehwoldt (born 1987), who wrestled as Aiden English in WWE. History Gory Guerrero, a legendary luchador, had four sons and all of them became wrestlers. His two elder sons Chavo and Mando debuted in the same year, 1974. Chavo wrestled the earlier part of his career in Los Angeles, California based NWA Hollywood Wrestling where he won Heavyweight and Tag Team titles many times. In 1976, Chavo formed a tag team with his father Gory and the duo wrestled in NWA Hollywood. They were the first members of the Guerrero family to make a tag team. On February 27, Chavo and Gory defeated Karl Von Brauner and Senior X to win the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship. However, their reign was cut short as on the next day, they lost the titles to Roddy Piper and Crusher Verdu. Gory fell into semi-retirement, ending the tag team of father and son. Chavo began teaming with other wrestlers in WWA roster and exchanged titles with Piper and Verdu while Gory retired in the 1980s. Chavo formed a new tag team with his brother Hector on January 13, 1978 when they defeated Black Gordman and Goliath to win the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship. This was the second tag team made up of Guerrero family members. This tag team version was better than Chavo's tag team with his father Gory. The two brothers, Chavo and Hector managed to hold the titles for a half month before losing them to Ron Bass and Dr. Hiro Ota on February 5. The two brothers teamed with separate wrestlers and exchanged the titles with Ron Bass and his partners before their team ended. Chavo continued his success in WWA. Hector formed a tag team with his elder brother Mando which debuted on June 29, 1979 when they defeated The Twin Devils for the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship. It was Hector's fourth individual reign and Mando's third individual reign while their first together. They lost the titles back to Twin Devils on July 6 before regaining the titles later that same month. On August 4, Hector and Mando lost the titles to Leroy Brown and Allen Coage. They won the titles with separate partners before defeating Ryuma Go and Mr. Toyo in their reunion on July 9, 1982 for their third Americas Tag Titles. The next month, they lost the titles to Timothy Flowers and Adrian Street. They had a third and final reunion in the independent circuit where they won the UWC Tag Team Championship. Chavo and Hector reunited in Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) on July 14, 1984 when they won the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship by defeating Mike Rotunda and Barry Windham. They held the titles for three months before Chavo quit in September. On October 2, Cocoa Samoa substituted Chavo and teamed with Hector to defend the titles against Jim Neidhart and Khrusher Khruschev. This caused Chavo and Hector to lose the titles to Neidhart and Khruschev and the team of Chavo and Hector disbanded. In the American Wrestling Association, Chavo and Mando teamed together to go after the AWA World Tag Team Championship held by Diamond Dallas Page's team of Badd Company (Paul Diamond and Pat Tanaka) but did not win the tag team titles. At SuperClash III, representing the AWA against the Continental Wrestling Association on December 13, 1988, Hector, Chavo, and Mando defeat the team of Cactus Jack and the Rock 'n' Roll RPMs. Chavo then formed a six- man tag team with his brothers Mando and Eddie in 1989 in the Mexican World Wrestling Association (WWA). They won the WWA World Trios Championship on April 30, defeating American Mercenaries (Bill Anderson, Louie Spicolli and Tim Patterson) before losing the titles back to American Mercenaries on July 28. Hector and Eddie formed a tag team in May 1998 in Carolinas based-Pro Wrestling Federation (PWF). On May 22, 1998, they defeated Super Ninja and Black Angel for the titles. Eddie began an angle with Chavo's son Chavo Guerrero, Jr. in 1998 while both were employed by World Championship Wrestling, marking the first time that Guerreros were aligned together on national television. They teamed and feuded with each other during that time until the angle ended when Eddie formed Latino World Order. The two then reunited in World Wrestling Entertainment on the SmackDown! brand in 2002 and formed a tag team called Los Guerreros. They found success on SmackDown!, winning the Tag Team Championship twice. The team broke in 2004 after Chavo turned on Eddie due to jealousy stemming from Eddie's popularity. Following the breakup of the Los Guerreros, Chavo Guerrero Jr. was soon joined by his father Chavo Guerrero Sr. who was later to be known as \\"Chavo Classic\\", and was primarily his son's manager throughout the run. Following Chavo's loss to Eddie at the Royal Rumble, Chavo was jealous of Rey Mysterio in the storyline because Mysterio had sung the theme song of the upcoming pay-per-view event, No Way Out, and because Mysterio was Cruiserweight Champion. Guerrero won the Cruiserweight Championship at No Way Out. A few months later on SmackDown, Chavo Guerrero challenged anybody to a match for the Cruiserweight title. Jacqueline accepted the challenge and won the title. At Judgment Day, Chavo regained the Cruiserweight Championship with one arm tied behind his back; however, Chavo Classic won the title by accident on that week's SmackDown in a triple threat match when Spike Dudley knocked him onto Chavo. Chavo Classic went on to hold the belt for about a month before he lost it to Rey Mysterio. Chavo Classic was later be fired by WWE for no-showing. He felt he should have been portrayed as a legend rather than a comedy act. The Guerreros would then reunite in WWE in 2006 when the widow of Eddie Guerrero, Vickie Guerrero acted as the manager/valet for Chavo, who was upset about Eddie's name being used by non-Guerreros (namely Rey Mysterio, with whom they maintained their first feud with). The duo used the cheating tactics that made the Guerreros famous, though this time to the dismay of the audience instead of the delight. It wasn't long after the end of their feud with Rey that Chris Benoit (another close friend of Eddie) started questioning their motives, leading to them feuding with Benoit over the course of a few short months, with Chavo becoming the number one contender for Benoit's WWE United States Championship, though failing at each opportunity mainly because of Vickie's actions constantly getting him disqualified, leading to Vickie leaving Chavo (she soon after declared in late January in backstage interviews with Kristal Marshall that she would be returning to SmackDown soon, though disappeared off of WWE TV directly after). It wasn't until mid-February at No Way Out 2007 that Chavo became WWE Cruiserweight Champion after emerging victorious in a Cruiserweight Open, which saw him as a surprise entry, pinning Jimmy Wang Yang to eliminate him last and win the title from Gregory Helms, ending Helms' more than a year- long reign. In 2008, Chavo and Vickie would form an \\"extended family\\" with Vickie's lover Edge, after interference by Edge allowed Chavo to win the ECW Championship. The stable was referred to on-screen as La Familia and also included the Rated-R Entourage, Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder, and Chavo's then- bodyguard, Bam Neely. La Familia broke up later in the year, after Vickie and Edge's relationship troubles led to the return of The Undertaker. Vickie and Chavo would then align with Big Show to keep The Undertaker off of their backs. Later, Chavo and Vickie would also realign with the returning Edge. In 2009, Vickie took advantage of Randy Orton's attacks on the McMahon family to take control of both Raw and SmackDown. Vickie would later leave SmackDown to become the permanent General Manager of Raw, leaving Edge on SmackDown although their kayfabe-marriage remains intact. Chavo would be subsequently drafted to Raw, continuing his role as his aunt Vickie's \\"gofer,\\" although constantly overriding her authority by booking matches. In 2010, Vickie became the \\"Official Consultant\\" to then General Manager of SmackDown, Theodore Long. Chavo then began supporting Vickie and her new storyline lover, Dolph Ziggler. In 2011, Chavo was released from WWE, ending Los Guerreros. However, Vickie remained with the company until June 2014.

It is a generalization of classical Euler‚ÄìBernoulli beam theory that approximates a beam as an assembly of thin- walled plates that are constrained to deform as a linear combination of specified deformation modes.  History Its origin is due to Richard Schardt (1966). Since then many other authors have extended the initial (first-order elastic) GBT formulations developed by Schardt and his co-workers. Many extensions and applications of GBT have been developed by Camotim (Instituto Superior T√©cnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal) and collaborators, since the beginning of the 21st century.  Description  The theory can be applied without restrictions to any prismatic thin-walled structural member exhibiting straight or curved axial axis (any loading, any cross-section geometry, any boundary conditions). GBT is in some ways analogous to the finite strip method and can be a more computationally efficient method than modeling a beam with a full 2D or 3D finite element method to predict the member structural behavior. GBT has been widely recognized as an efficient approach to analyzing thin- walled members and structural systems. The efficiency arises mostly from its modal nature ‚Äì the displacement field is expressed as a linear combination of cross-section deformation modes whose amplitudes vary continuously along the member length (x axis) - see Figures 2-3. Due to GBT assumptions inherent to a thin-walled member, only 3 non-null stress components are considered in the formulations (see Fig. 1). Membrane displacement field (i.e., in the cross- section mid-surface): : \\\\begin{align} u(s,x) & = u_k(s) \\\\zeta_{k,x}(x), \\\\\\\\\\\\ v(s,x) & = v_k(s) \\\\zeta_k(x), \\\\\\\\\\\\ w(s,x) & = w_k(s) \\\\zeta_k(x). \\\\end{align} The GBT modal nature makes it possible to (i) acquire in-depth knowledge on the mechanics of the thin-walled member behaviour and (ii) judiciously exclude, from subsequent similar GBT analyses, those deformation modes found to play no (or negligible) role in the particular behaviour under scrutiny. Eliminating modes that play no role reduces the number of degrees of freedom involved in a GBT analysis and increases its computational efficiency. GBT has proven useful in the understanding of the structural behaviour under analysis as well as in its computational efficiency.

The prohibition dates back to the Gambling Act 1935. The Playing Cards Act prohibits private ownership of more than 120 playing cards without approval of the government. Nevertheless, illegal gambling in casinos (Thai: ‡∏ö‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏û‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏ô) and other forms of gambling still exist in Bangkok and some provincial towns.Phongpaichit, P., Piriyarangsan, S. Treerat, N. (1998). Guns, girls, gambling, ganja: Thailand's Illegal Economy. Chiang Mai, Thailand: Silkworm Books.  History  Gambling has long been a feature of Thai society. Local Siamese partook in more than 100 well known gambling games.Warren, J.A. (2013) Gambling: The State and Society in Thailand, c.1800-1945. Oxford: Routledge. Some gambling forms such as betting on cockfights, bullfights and boat races are native to Siamese culture. The late-19th century marked a significant increase in the level of gambling in Siam. People started to gamble more frequently and a variety of games were introduced from foreign traders and immigrants, and gambling started to hit the mainstream. It was during that period that the Huay lottery was introduced from China and became popular in Siam. Over the course of decades the Government of Thailand allowed legal gambling dens. During the reign of King Rama III, the Government of Thailand promoted legal gambling dens as a source of revenue. These legal dens were then closed down to dampen criminal activity and bankruptcy related to gambling. During the reign of King Rama V gambling was forbidden in the south and all the remaining gambling venues were closed on 1 April 1917. A gambling act was first passed in 1930 and revised in 1935. During the premiership of Khuang Aphaiwong, the ministry of finance was assigned by the government to legalize gambling in Pran Buri District, Prachuap Khiri Khan Province and became an official promoter of gambling. However, this period of legalization of casinos did not last long. Under attack from the media and public, the government abandoned the attempt to earn additional revenue from casinos and prohibited gambling once again. Forms of gambling =Casinos= Despite laws against gambling, illegal casinos are widespread in Thailand. The first large-scale gambling houses were established in Ayutthaya by the government in the late-17th century or early-18th century as a result of the steady growth of Chinese population. During the 19th century the number of gambling houses grew in tandem with the population of Chinese immigrants. To promote the settlement and taxation of the Chinese population in Thailand, the Thai government turned a blind eye to gambling among Chinese immigrants. As a result of this inadvertent endorsement, local Siamese were encouraged to gamble as well. After the gambling act was first passed in 1930 casinos were banned completely and gambling was prohibited in Thai society. =Lottery = The lottery was introduced to Thailand by Chinese immigrants in 1820. Commonly known to the local as \\"huay\\", the term is a direct translation of Chinese word huƒÅ (Chinese:Ëä±) :flower. In the beginning huay was mainly played among the community of Chinese immigrants in Thailand. It was then officially established during the reign of King Rama III to stimulate the circulation of currency as well as to generate national revenue. =Government lottery= In the reign of King Rama VI, the government introduced lottery draws as a device for tax collection. In 1939 the government of Luang Phibun Songkram set up the Lottery Bureau to organize a regular monthly draw in Thailand. It was then extended to twice a month in 1989. Draws normally happen twice a month on the 1st and 16th. There are a total of 38 million tickets per round. 28 percent of the sales value of the lottery ticket is retained as government revenue, 12 percent in administration and management and 60 percent is returned to players as prizes. =Gambling on sport = Football is the most recent form of illegal gambling in Thailand. As a result of technology such as online transactions, satellite TV, Internet, and mobile phone betting systems, football gambling has become widely spread among the population of Thailand. During the 2010 South Africa World cup, over 1,700 people were arrested for gambling offences. Social issues Thai society has long frowned on gambling. In Buddhism, gambling is one of four vices which lead to ruin. In Thai this concept is known as abaiyamuk (‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏°‡∏∏‡∏Ç), the \\"portals of hell\\". For the layperson, gambling is something to be avoided if one wishes to be free from suffering. Thai people often cite an old proverb \\"Ten lost to fire is not equivalent to one lost in gambling\\" which reflects the variety of social problems associated with gambling in Thai culture. This may include violent crime, financial problems, and gambling addiction. Despite the prohibition, gambling still remains a major part of Thai life. Thais often gamble in various ceremonies and festivals. According to Alan Klima's study of funeral casinos in present-day Thailand, gambling is used as an attraction for people to keep the deceased spirit company.

The local names in Chile are zarcilla, monte negro and uva de la cordillera. It has small narrow entire leaves, and small yolk-colored flowers and later globose blue-black berries. The species originates south of 30¬∫S in Argentina and Chili, where it grows on sunny, often gravelly soils, and is sometimes planted as an ornamental elsewhere in temperate climates.  Description  Heath barberry is a low (up to ¬Ω m high and over 1 m wide in the wild) shrub. The mature twigs have a warm brown color, with 3-branched, flattened, light brown spines (1-1¬Ω cm long) under each short side shoot. The thick, narrow leaves are semi-deciduous, linear in shape (1‚Äì2 cm long), somewhat bluish-green, with entire, rolled-under margins, and pointed, often purplish tips that may later die-down to a light brown. The flowers are radially symmetrical (about ¬Ω cm), occur late in spring individually or in small umbels, are yolk yellow hinting towards orange. As in other Berberis species, the tepals are set in four whorls of three to five and equal in shape and color, so it is difficult to separate sepals from petals. The filament has a tooth on each side near its upper end, where the anther is attached. The fruit is a globose, blue-black berry of about 7 mm in diameter.  Taxonomy  Like almost every Berberis species in South-America, B. empetrifolia belongs to the subgenus Australes, characterised by simple, evergreen leaves and glaucous, purplish to black berries. Within that subgenus, B. empetrifolia forms a group with B. actinacantha, B. congestiflora, B. rotundifolia, B. horrida, B. microphylla, B. glomerata, B. grevilleana, and B. comberi. This group more or less shares the following character states: leafy spines, flowers in umbels, short styles, filaments with teeth, and palmately veined leaves. Berberis empetrifolia occurs to form natural hybrids with at least B. grevilleana and B. montana.  Distribution  Heath barberry occurs is southern Argentina and Chile, up to subalpine or alpine heights in the Andes among rocks and grows largest in stable scree.  Ecology  Berberis empetrifolia is adapted to tough microclimates, and typically grows in such places as the stormy beaches of the southern islands and inlets of Chile, the constant drying winds of Patagonia such as in Ainsen, and rocky Andes slopes. The berries are eaten by wildlife, such as the lizard Liolaemus belii. Research has shown the seeds are adapted to digestion as both germination speed and total final rate are higher after passing through the gut, and this is possibly caused by abbration of a waxy layer from the seed in the gut. This does not only lead to dispersal over a wider area, but also do these lizards fecate often on bare soil, which improves the chances of survival of the seedlings.  Use  As in all barberry species, the rhizomes contain berberine, an alkaloid salt with antibacterial effects, antitumour activity, and a beneficial influence on diabetes and cholesterol levels. As it is not easily taken up by the body, oral treatment against enteric infections such as bacterial dysentery can be effective without serious impacts elsewhere in the body. Glycyrrhiza, a component of liquorice contains an antagonist of berberine, and will neutralise its effect. cited on The berry of the heath barberry is edible raw or cooked, and it can be used in jams after removing the seeds. The rest of the plant is poisonous. It is sometimes planted as an ornamental, and in good soil it can eventually exceed 1 m in height and 2 m wide.

It is part of a media franchise referred to internally as Science Visual Novel, which also includes Occultic;Nine. The developers are aiming to release the game in late 2020. Plot In the year 2036, the \\"2036 Problem\\" occurs, where an incident involving computers leads to the destruction of major cities around the world. A similar event is expected to take place in 2038, so a supercomputer called Gaia is used to create an alternate Earth using an Earth Simulator in order to study the possible effects of the impending catastrophe. The experiment was initially inconclusive because of the possibility of low birth rates in the alternate Earth, so a message called the Arecibo Message was used to allow humans to live there. However, humanity in the alternate Earth then creates their own Earth Simulator which leads to questions about the original Earth's existence. The game takes place in 2037. The protagonist, a hacker named Pollon Takaoka, has an ability which allows him to save and load moments, much like save features in video games.  Development and release  Anonymous;Code is developed by Chiyomaru Studio and Mages, and is written by Chiyomaru Shikura. It is the first stand-alone work developed by Chiyomaru Studio, and is part of a franchise referred to internally as Science Visual Novel, which also includes Occultic;Nine and is separate from the developers' Science Adventure series. In contrast with the concept of infinitely expanding horizontal \\"world lines\\" used in Shikura's Science Adventure game Steins;Gate, Anonymous;Code uses the concept of infinitely expanding vertical \\"world layers\\", with the main character being able to manipulate layers below his, and is themed around hacking. According to Shikura, the game's role is in part resolving unanswered questions from the Science Adventure series. Shikura stated that he initially wanted to increase the game's immersion by applying a unique artwork to every scene and using full animation during major events. However, he realised the game would need at least 3000 different artworks (in contrast to the usual 100 found in visual novels), not counting the costs to produce the animations, and thus discarded this idea. His research on how to lower the costs of an immersive visual novel led him to consider reusing old animation, developing Steins;Gate Elite from this idea. The game is planned to be released by Mages for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Nintendo Switch in Japan. The game is planned to be released in late 2020, following a delay from \\"before the 2020 Summer Olympics\\".

It was established in 1921. The eparchy is divided into five deaneries: Northern, Eastern, Bavarian and Hessen, Southern, and Western. The Resurrection Cathedral in Berlin is the main cathedral of the eparchy. The eparchy is headed by Tikhon (Zaytsev) since 2017.  History  St. Simeon of the Wonderful Mountain Church, Dresden St. Alexis Memorial Church to the Russian Honour, Leipzig In the 18th and 19th centuries Eastern Orthodox parishes and churches on the territory of Germany were established mainly near Russian diplomatic offices and areas with significant number of Russians foreign nationals, especially in spa cities. The new parishes helped to build close relationships between the ruling dynasty and the aristocracy. After the revolutions in 1917, a large diaspora of Russian Orthodox people emigrated to Germany. On 8 April 1921, Patriarch Tikhon, citing the regulation of the Highest Church Authority from 19 November 1920, assigned archbishop Eulogius (Georgiyevsky), one of many Russian emigrees, the leadership of Western Europe. The temporal residence of Eulogius and archimandrite Tikhon (Lyashchenko) became the Alexandrov refuge in Berlin. Under Eulogius, Russian Orthodox communities were founded in Berlin, Tegel, Dresden, Wiesbaden, Bad Kissingen, Baden-Baden and Hamburg. Other parishes were founded in prison camps and refugee settlements in W√ºnsdorf, Quedlinburg, Lichtenhorst and Scheuen. After the signing of the peace treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany, the independence from the German government resulted in the handover of churches to the Russian parishes. However, the lack of rooms for the parishes was a major problem for the diaspora. For example, prior to the peace treaty the liturgy in Berlin was performed at the former St. Vladimir ambassador church, but the Soviet regime closed the building and the parish had to use private rooms. Tensions between the head of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) Anthony (Khrapovitsky) and the metropolitan Eulogius, who from 1922 lived in Paris, resulted to a break of Russian Orthodox parishes in Germany. At the ROCOR Bishops' Council in Sremski Karlovci in June 1926 it was decided that Tikhon (Lyashchenko) would rule over the Germany Diocese. Almost all parishes in Germany were now under the jurisdiction of the ROCOR. After Adolf Hitler's coming to power in 1933, the government exerted pressure to the parishes of Eulogius, who on 10 June 1931 was dismissed by Sergius (Stragorodsky) and later changed the jurisdiction to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and ordered to subordinate to the bishop of Berlin Tikhon (Lyashchenko). After Second World War and Germany's capitulation ROCOR parishes gradually switched to the ROC. Since October 1946, Eastern Orthodox parishes of the Moscow Patriarchate in Germany joined the newly formed Middle-European Exarchate of ROC, which was headed by archbishop Sergius (Korolyov). On 11 November 1954, German parishes joined the West-European Exarchate of ROC, following the Holy Synod ruling \\"Deaneries of Russian Orthodox churches in Germany\\". The Berlin Diocese was re-established on 15 August 1957, and since 1960 was the eparchial center of the Middle- European Exarchate. From 1952 to 1954 the eparchy began publishing its journal The Voice of Orthodoxy (–ì–æ–ª–æ—Å –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–∏—è) in Russian. The publication was revived in May 1961, now in German language and under the German title Stimme der Orthodoxie. Commissioned by the Middle-European Exarchate of ROC, its aim was to \\"introduce the readers to events inside the ROC, and foremost to the church life of orthodox parishes in Germany and the Exarchate\\". The journal published articles, notes, receptions about such themes as inter-religious affairs and works of foreign theologians about Orthodoxy. On 24 February 1971, the Holy Synod of ROC decided to extract the Baden and Bavaria Diocese from the Berlin Diocese on the federal states Bavaria and Baden-W√ºrttemberg, and the D√ºsseldorf Diocese on the states Bremen, Hamburg, Hessen, Lower Saxony, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein. The seven remaining parishes in Berlin, Weimar, Dresden, Leipzig and Potsdam went to the Berlin Diocese. With the Bishop's Council's decision from 30‚Äì31 January 1990, all foreign exarchates of the ROC, including the Western- European Exarchate, were abolished, and the eparchies which belonged to the exarchate now were under subordination of the Patriarch and the Synod, meaning directly to the Department for External Church Relations (DECR).Determination of the Bishop's Counicl. // Journal of the Moscow Patriarchate (JMP). 1990, No. 5, p. 6 After the liquidation of the Western-European Exarchate, the eparchy was renamed Berlin and Leipzig Diocese. On 23 December 1992 the Synod decided to unite the three eparchies (Berlin and Leipzig, Baden and Bavaria, D√ºsseldorf) into the Berlin and Germany Diocese. By 1993, there were 18 parishes of the Berlin and Germany Diocese. On 21 March 1996, the Berlin Diocese went to the Budapest and Hungary Diocese of the Moscow Patriarchate, which before that was governed by the DECR. From the early 90s until the mid-2000s over 300 thousand emigrants from Russia and former USSR states moved to Germany, many of whom were Orthodox Christians. From 1992 to 2007 the number of parishes increased from 12 to 61. The number of Russian Orthodox Christians in 2000 was over 50 thousand. By January 2002, the eparchy consisted of 42 parishes, 22 churches, 33 priests and 8 deacons.

His uncle Samad, trained him \\"in the use of AK-47 and PK machine guns, rockets and mortars as well as satellite phones and VHF radios.\\" Upbringing Wasil Ahmad was born in Uruzgan province. The region has been described as \\"long... a centre of conflict;\\" Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar was born there, and the later president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, led the first Pashtun revolt against the Taliban there in 2001. Ahmad's father had previously been killed fighting the Taliban, and his son later said that seeking revenge for his father's death was his main motivation in going to war. Ahmad's uncle was the Afghan Local Police commander in Khas Uruzgan District, Uruzgan province. He had previously been a Taliban commander, but had changed sides in 2012, and was now fighting for the Afghan government. In summer 2015, Khas Uruzgan- his area of control- was besieged by the Taliban, and Samad was injured. Ahmad subsequently took command of his uncle's unit. Siege Oruzgan districts At the height of the Dan Sango siege, Ahmad was commanding 75 pro-government soldiers against an attacking force of approximately \\"hundreds\\" of Taliban. The siege itself lasted for 71 days, and Ahmad commanded his squad for 43 of them. He fired both mortars and rockets as well as machine guns from the compound roof. As well as physical fighting, Ahmad was also responsible for communications with the outside world, and the point of contact for the Afghan special forces. When the latter raised the siege in August 2015, Ahmad and 35 surviving soldiers were airlifted out by Afghan and NATO helicopters to Tarin Kowt. According to Samad, the authorities \\"praised him and his nephew Wasil as heroes.\\" Murder Following the siege, Ahmad enrolled into school in the fourth- grade, whilst also receiving private tuition at home. He improved his English, although was not \\"a good student\\" ‚Äì possibly, a neighbour later commented, because he had been \\"highly encouraged by police officials and awarded medals for his bravery\\" and only \\"wanted to play with weapons and drive police vehicles as a hobby.\\" He was authorised to carry a pistol to school. On Monday, 1 February 2015, at the local bazaar, on his way to school, he was shot twice in the head by masked gunmen in a motorbike drive-by shooting, in what has been called a \\"targeted assassination\\". He later died in a Kandahar hospital and was buried in the local Shahidano cemetery. Controversy Following Ahmad's death, there was controversy as to his precise position in the besieged force. Samad stressed that Ahmad was merely \\"defending his family,\\" whilst Samad recovered from injuries he had already received. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, however, said that, since he had been supplied with a gun and a police uniform, this was in breach of anti- child-soldiering laws. The Commission also suggested that the police had themselves endangered Ahmad's life by lauding him as a hero. They had garlanded him 'with plastic flowers' and even held a program at Police headquarters \\"where his bravery and courage was talked about by officials.\\" The government Ministry of Interior Affairs also denied that child soldiers were used by government forces; conversely, the charity Child Soldiers International has also claimed that both sides used them.

Religious Importance Gurdwara Meetha Reetha Sahib was constructed around year 1960 and is situated near the village Deyuri in Uttrakhand. Guru Nanak Dev Ji visited this place with Bhai Mardana Ji. There were Jogis sitting under the reetha (soapnut) trees. Guru Nanak Dev ji sat under a reetha tree and asked Bhai Mardana Ji to eat a reetha. Reethas are usually bitter in taste but the reetha which Guru Nanak Dev Ji plucked for Bhai Mardana Ji was sweet. Jogis were surprised by all this and later they come to know that on which side Guru Nanak Dev Ji was sitting all the reethas has become sweet. These trees are still there in the Gurudwara and the reethas are still said to be sweet in taste. This is the reason why this place is called Meetha Reetha Sahib. Even today the people who visits the Gurudwara gets sweet reethas (soapnuts) as prashad. Due to its religious background this place is considered as a holy place for Sikhs.

Business consultant James \\"Jim\\" Olive and his wife Naomi were murdered in their home by their 16-year-old adopted daughter Marlene Olive and her 20-year-old boyfriend Charles \\"Chuck\\" Riley, who then attempted to dispose of the bodies by burning them in a barbecue pit at a nearby campground. Riley was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and received a sentence of death, which was later changed to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. Marlene Olive, tried as a juvenile, received a sentence of three to six years in a California Youth Authority juvenile facility, from which she was released at age 21 having served a little over four years. The case gained worldwide attention due to the age of the perpetrators, the details of the crime, and the wide disparity in sentencing between the two perpetrators. Riley and Marlene Olive have also been the subjects of continuing coverage in connection with his repeated bids for parole and her subsequent convictions for numerous other crimes. Background =Olive family background= Marlene Louise Olive was born in Norfolk, Virginia, on January 15, 1959 to an unmarried mother and was adopted as a newborn by middle-aged childless couple James \\"Jim\\" and Naomi Olive. Marlene Olive spent most of her childhood up to her early teens in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where her adoptive father Jim Olive worked as a marketing executive for Tenneco and Gulf Oil. She was very close to her adoptive father but had a troubled relationship with her adoptive mother, who reportedly suffered from alcoholism and mental illness. When Marlene Olive was 14, her father lost his job and he moved the family back to the United States, settling in Marin County, California, in the Terra Linda community of the city of San Rafael. Jim Olive became a self-employed small business consultant and spent less time with his daughter as he tried to make his business succeed. Marlene Olive had difficulty adjusting from her relatively sheltered life in Ecuador to the unfamiliar, permissive Northern California teen culture. She developed a stomach ulcer requiring prescription pills and soon began to use the pills and other drugs recreationally and socialize with other teenage drug users. She also became interested in glam rock, witchcraft, and prostitution, the third interest stemming from repeatedly being called a \\"whore\\" by Naomi Olive, her adoptive mother. The relationship between Marlene and Naomi Olive worsened after the move to the United States, and their arguments began to erupt into domestic violence. Over time, Marlene Olive also developed resentment toward her father for siding with her mother in disputes and suspected him of informing police about her friends' drug activities. She shoplifted, stole her parents' credit cards, used and overdosed on drugs, ran away from home, and received stolen goods from burglaries committed by a boyfriend. She talked to several friends about wanting to kill her parents and asked some of them to help, but the friends either did not take her seriously or decided not to get involved. At one point, she attempted to poison her mother herself by mixing large doses of prescription drugs into her mother's food, but the drugs made the food taste bitter, and Naomi refused to eat it. =Chuck Riley's background= Charles \\"Chuck\\" Riley was born on May 2, 1955[‚ÄúCouples That Kill‚Äù by Carol Anne Davis, published 7/01/2005] in Marin County to Oscar and Joanne Riley and lived most of his life there in Santa Venetia, the son of a bakery worker and a nurse's aide. Having been obese since childhood, by age 15, he weighed over 300 pounds. Before he met Marlene Olive, he had never had a girlfriend. Riley dropped out of high school in his senior year and worked as a newspaper and pizza deliveryman, bartender, and factory worker. He was a heavy drug user and also dealt drugs, both to earn money and to gain social status and popularity. He owned several guns and was a skilled marksman.In re Riley, No. A145041 (Cal. Ct. App. Dec. 3, 2015) (unpublished opinion). =Chuck Riley's relationship with Marlene Olive= When he was 19, Riley met 15-year-old Marlene Olive while dealing drugs at her high school. He developed a crush on her and began to pursue her. Although she was initially put off by his weight, the couple eventually had sex and began a relationship largely controlled by Marlene Olive. Riley provided her with free drugs, gifts, and transportation, listened to her problems, and sometimes helped her carry out sexual or criminal fantasies. She frequently threatened to break up with Riley unless he did what she wanted and claimed to have magical powers of control over him, in which he reportedly believed. He was anxious to please her in order to continue the relationship and twice attempted suicide when she briefly broke up with him. As she had with previous boyfriends, Marlene Olive soon began to ask Riley for help or advice in killing her mother or suggest that he himself kill her parents. Jim and Naomi Olive initially approved of their daughter dating Riley, finding him polite and responsible. At Marlene Olive's suggestion, the couple carried out a prolonged shoplifting spree, stealing approximately $6,000 in merchandise (primarily women's clothing and accessories) from local stores over several weeks until they were caught in the act and arrested for grand larceny in March 1975. Riley had no prior history of delinquency or antisocial conduct as a juvenile (aside from drug dealing), and this was his first adult arrest. In May 1975, Riley was arrested again for possession of marijuana and a sawed-off shotgun. Jim and Naomi Olive threatened their daughter with juvenile hall, planned to send her away to school, and forbade her to see Riley again, the prohibition also being included in a court order. Jim Olive ordered Riley to stay away from the Olives' house, threatening to kill him if he ever returned. Murders On Saturday, June 21, 1975, following another argument with her mother, Marlene Olive telephoned Riley and told him, \\"Get your gun, we've got to kill the bitch today\\". She arranged to go out with her father, leaving her mother home alone and leaving a door unlocked through which Riley could then enter and kill her mother. Riley, who was carrying a loaded .22 caliber revolver and later said he had taken LSD, entered the house where Naomi Olive was sleeping.China Camp State Park in Marin County, California, where the bodies of murder victims Jim and Naomi Olive were burned in a barbecue pit. Afterward, Riley told police that he had struck Naomi Olive \\"many times\\" with a hammer (a statement he later recanted under hypnosis) and also stabbed and suffocated her. While Riley was still in the house, Jim Olive returned, saw his wife lying in bed covered with blood, picked up a knife, and started toward Riley, exclaiming, \\"I'll kill you\\". Riley drew his gun and shot Jim Olive four times, killing him. Marlene Olive and Riley tried to dispose of the bodies by transporting them to a wooded area at nearby China CampAt the time of the crime in 1975, China Camp was a largely undeveloped area used by local young people as a party spot. It became part of a newly established state park the following year. and burning them in a barbecue pit with gasoline and logs in an attempt to make them unrecognizable. The couple left while the bodies were still burning. A fireman who arrived shortly thereafter to put out the unattended fire initially mistook the partially burnt remains for a deer carcass. The couple later returned to the park and further burned the remains along with additional evidence. With a friend, the couple cleaned up the room where the killings had taken place, removing blood from the carpet, walls, and furniture. They confided in the friend who helped clean and in several other friends that they had killed the Olives, with Riley physically carrying out the killings. Riley told friends, \\"We had to do it. They wouldn't let me see her.\\" Marlene Olive and Riley continued to live together at the Olives' house for several days, attending a Yes concert, shopping, eating at restaurants, and paying their expenses using cash, checks, and credit cards taken from her dead parents. They allegedly planned to wait for Jim and Naomi to be declared dead, collect the life insurance money, and move to Ecuador. After a few days, Jim Olive's business partner became concerned about his absence from work and contacted police, who visited the Olive house and spoke with Marlene Olive. She provided various alibis for herself and Riley, which the police later determined were false, and stories about her parents having either disappeared or died, claiming that one parent had killed the other and then disappeared with the body or that both parents were killed by Hells Angels. Police also noted the recently cleaned room in the otherwise disordered house. The friend who had helped clean informed the police about the blood in the room and the couple's statements about killing the Olives and burning their bodies. Acting either on information from Marlene Olive or from her friend, police searched the China Camp barbecue pit and determined that it contained fragments of burnt human remains. Marlene Olive and Riley were arrested. After his arrest, Riley made a detailed confession, in which he said that he and Marlene Olive had been planning to kill her parents for some time, that he had beaten, stabbed, and suffocated Naomi Olive and then shot Jim Olive, and that Marlene Olive had made him do it. However, Marlene Olive claimed that Riley had killed her parents of his own accord and that afterward, he had held her hostage and forced her to take drugs. Court proceedings =Chuck Riley's trial= Based on his initial confession, Riley, who was an adult over 18 (aged 20) at the time of the crime, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder for killing Jim and Naomi Olive and faced the death penalty. Under hypnosis, Riley later recanted the part of his initial confession about beating Naomi Olive with the hammer, saying that when he entered the house, he found Naomi Olive lying in bed, bleeding from head wounds and near death, with the hammer embedded in her head. Riley thus implied that Marlene Olive (who had been using the hammer that morning to repair a platform shoe) had fatally beaten her mother with the hammer before leaving the house. Riley contended that he had stabbed and suffocated Naomi Olive because she was suffering and near death from the hammer attack, and he was trying to end her misery. He said that he initially confessed to killing Naomi Olive in order to protect Marlene Olive by taking the blame for her actions. Riley admitted shooting Jim Olive, but said he acted out of fear and self-defense as Jim had threatened to kill him. At his trial, Chuck testified under hypnosis about the events of the murder and that he had not beaten Naomi Olive. The jury was not convinced, and convicted him on both counts of first-degree murder for killing both victims. He was sentenced to death on January 26, 1976. Author and reporter Richard M. Levine later wrote that compared to Marlene Olive, Riley did not harbor much anger at Naomi Olive, whom he barely knew, and therefore Riley would be less likely to use a method of homicide suggesting rage; that Riley would have used his loaded gun as the weapon rather than a hammer; and that Marlene Olive had previously asked Riley how hard she would have to hit Naomi Olive in order to kill her. However, others have noted that Marlene had no blood on her clothing when she left the house and would not have had time to change clothes; that Riley used a hammer to avoid alerting neighbors because it made less noise than a gunshot; and that according to a hypnosis expert, Riley's revised confession lacked credibility. Marlene Olive continued to maintain that Riley had beaten and killed her mother in addition to shooting her father, and denied that she herself had any part in the killing of either parent. =Marlene Olive's juvenile court trial= Marlene Olive, who was a minor aged 16 at the time of the crime, was tried as a juvenile rather than an adult, and was represented by the well-known defense attorney Terence Hallinan. She was charged with violating Section 602 of the California State Welfare and Institutions Code, which at that time covered any crime committed by a juvenile, from petty crimes up to and including murder. The court ruled that she had violated Section 602, stating that she \\"did encourage, instigate, aid, abet, and act as accomplice in the homicides of her parents.\\" In announcing his decision, Judge Charles R. Best stated, \\"The uncontroverted evidence regarding the father is that Chuck Riley killed him. As to who actually did in the mother, we'll never know.\\" Marlene Olive was sentenced to a term of four to six years confinement at the California Youth Authority at Ventura (also known as the Ventura School). She was to be released by her 21st birthday unless the youth authority determined she had not been rehabilitated, in which case she could be kept in custody up to age 23. Aftermath =Chuck Riley= In December 1976, the California state supreme court ruled that the California death penalty statute, which then required a mandatory death penalty for certain categories of murder, was unconstitutional in view of the U.S. Supreme Court's recent rulings in Gregg v. Georgia and other cases.Rockwell v. Superior Ct., 18 Cal. 3d 420 (Cal. 1976). As a result, California prisoners sentenced to death under the unconstitutional statute, including Riley, could not be executed. Riley's sentence was changed from death to two concurrent life sentences with the possibility of parole after 7 years. While in prison, Riley lost weight, received his high school diploma and earned the equivalent of a college degree. After becoming eligible, Riley applied for parole approximately a dozen times and was denied each time. In 2011, Riley, now aged 56 and suffering from physical disabilities, appealed his most recent denial on the grounds that there was no evidence he continued to be a danger to the community, that the parole board did not consider his age, and that his sentence had been unconstitutionally excessive. Riley won a new court-ordered parole hearing, at which the parole board found him suitable for release and granted parole. However, on February 6, 2015, the parole board's decision was reversed by California Governor Jerry Brown, who explained that \\"although [Riley] professes to accept some responsibility, he continues to downplay his role in this crime. Until Mr. Riley is able to come to terms with his role in this horrendous double murder, I do not believe he will be able to avoid violent behavior if released.\\" Riley appealed the Governor's reversal of the parole board's decision. On December 3, 2015, the California Court of Appeal for the First District vacated the Governor's reversal and reinstated Riley's grant of parole, stating, \\"We cannot affirm the Governor‚Äôs decision because the premise of his conclusion‚Äîthat Riley has failed 'to come to terms with his role in the double murder'‚Äîis unsupported by any evidence. There being no evidence in the record that Riley 'continues to downplay his role in this crime,' the Governor‚Äôs decision cannot stand.\\" Following the court's directive, the parole board's 2015 annual report released in January 2016 showed Riley as having been deemed suitable for release and granted parole as of December 8, 2015. =Marlene Olive= Marlene Olive began serving her sentence at the Ventura School and was later allowed to serve part of her time living outside the school with a young woman who had been a juvenile services volunteer. A few weeks before Marlene Olive was due to be paroled, she escaped and fled to New York City where she worked as a prostitute. She was eventually arrested and returned to California to finish her sentence, finally being released in 1980 when she was 21. After being released, she moved to the Los Angeles area, where she changed her name numerous times and was arrested at least seven different times over the next decade on forgery and drug-related charges, serving two one-year terms in jail. In 1986, she was one of 14 people arrested in Los Angeles for allegedly operating a large counterfeiting and forgery ring, of which she was thought to be the ringleader. She was subsequently convicted and sentenced to five years in prison. She served additional prison terms in California after a 1992 conviction for making a false financial statement, and a 1995 conviction for possessing a forged drivers' license. In 2003, in Kern County, California, she pleaded guilty to passing a fictitious check in Bakersfield and was sentenced to seven years in prison. A 1992 Los Angeles Times article called her \\"the queen of the trashers\\" due to her alleged skills at committing forgery and fraud and creating false identities based on documents, such as voided checks, obtained from discarded garbage. Police said \\"they [had] rarely come across a street-level forger believed to be as prolific or as skilled as Olive.\\" Marlene Olive saw Chuck Riley only once after they were arrested for murder, when she visited him in prison in 1981. After the visit, Riley correctly predicted, \\"I'll never see her again.\\" In popular culture Marlene Olive, graphite and ink drawing by Marlene McCarty Richard M. Levine, a feature writer for numerous publications including The New York Times, New York, Harper's, and Esquire, wrote a true crime book about the case, Bad Blood: A Family Murder in Marin County (Random House, 1982), which was widely reviewed and became a bestseller. The case was also discussed in John Godwin's book Murder U.S.A.: The Ways We Kill Each Other (Ballantine, 1978) and in several later true crime anthologies. During the 1990s, Levine's book inspired American artist Marlene McCarty to create a series of drawings about the teenage Marlene Olive, her relationships, and the barbecue murders. These led to a broader group of works by McCarty on the subject of teenage female murderers known as Murder Girls, which explored issues of female aggression, sexuality, sexism, and family relations. Marlene Olive continued to be, in the words of Maud Lavin, the \\"chief protagonist\\" of the series, and at least one exhibition of McCarty's work focused solely on her and the barbecue murders. McCarty's drawing entitled Marlene Olive: 353 Hibiscus Way ‚Äî Marin County, California ‚Äî June 21, 1975., (Mural 2: Chuck, Jim, Marlene ‚Äì December 21, 1974) (2003), is now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. McCarty based her art works concerning Marlene Olive on the theory, presented by Riley's defense counsel and Levine, that Marlene Olive had beaten her mother Naomi to death with the hammer. The barbecue murders were dramatized in a 2014 episode of the true crime documentary series Killer Kids entitled \\"Please Kill For Me\\" (Season 3, Episode 12).

Controversies  In 1998, a Puerto Rican woman died from post-surgery complications 15 days after Contreras performed a lipoinjection in her legs. The next year, Dominican journalist Isabel Vargas also died after having a liposuction at Contreras clinic. Both cases prompted an investigation of the clinic's practice, as well as a criminal case against Contreras. In 2002, a judge revoked the suspension on Contreras, allowing him to practice medicine during his judicial process. In 2004, former consul Mar√≠a de los Angeles Morel died from complications of a liposuction performed by Contreras. In 2006, he was acquitted of the death of Morel, while in 2010 he was also acquitted of the death of Vargas. The latest case occurred in 2015 when a Dominican woman also died from complications after undergoing a lipsculpture surgery performed by Contreras. During the investigation, many patients came forward to defend his practice. In 2015, a group of 20 patients of Contreras organized a press conference to voice their support for him, after his clinic was closed by the Public Health Ministry. Although the family of the woman claimed they would sue the clinic, an autopsy performed by the National Institute of Forensic Pathology revealed that there was no malpractice. As a result, the Minister of Public Health reinstated Contreras to perform surgery again.

He was one of the best staying two-year-olds in Britain in 1987 when he won four of his five races including the Washington Singer Stakes and the William Hill Futurity. He failed to win as a three-year- old but did finish third in the Prix du Jockey Club and ran prominently in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He remained in training for two more seasons, recording his only subsequent win in the 1989 Prix Gontaut-Biron. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a sire of winners in Brazil. Background Emmson was a bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by the Ballymacoll Stud. He was sired by Ela-Mana-Mou an outstanding middle distance performer whose wins included the Eclipse Stakes and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 1980. His other progeny included Double Trigger, Snurge and Almaarad. Emmson's dam Happy Kin won three races from thirty-three starts in North America between 1977 and 1980. She was descended from Great Niece, a full-sister to Great Nephew and the female-line ancestor of many major winners including Swain. Emmson raced in the colours of Ballymacoll's owners Michael Sobell and Arnold Weinstock. He was trained by Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. Racing career =1987: two-year-old season= On what was scheduled to be his racecourse debut, Emmson was withdrawn at the start of a race at Salisbury after his jockey reported him to be \\"wrong behind\\". Five days later he appeared to be completely sound when winning a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse. In July, over the same course and distance, he won the Donnington Castle Stakes, beating the John Dunlop-trained favourite Alwuhush by three quarters of a length. The Washington Singer Stakes in August, again over seven furlongs at Newbury, saw the colt moving up in class and winning by three quarters of a length from Zelphi. He was then stepped up in class and distance for the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes over one mile at Ascot Racecourse in September and started the 13/2 fourth choice in the betting. Ridden as usual by Willie Carson he was slightly hampered in the straight before staying on to finish fourth behind Sanquirico, Undercut and Alwuhush. On 24 October Emmson was one of six colts to contest the Group One William Hill Futurity. He was made the 7/1 third favourite behind the undefeated Salse (winner of the Somerville Tattersall Stakes) and Alwuhush, with the best fancied of the other three runners being Sheriff's Star. After racing in third place behind the outsiders Top Class and Ilishpour he moved to the front two furlongs out and held off the late challenge of Sheriff's Star, with Salse two lengths back in third. =1988: three-year-old season= Emmson began his second season in the Dante Stakes (a major trial race for The Derby) over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse in May. He led for most of the way but was overtaken in the last quarter mile and finished fourth of the seven runners behind Red Glow. He bypassed the Derby in favour of the Prix du Jockey Club at Chantilly Racecourse and finished third beaten a short head and three quarters of a length by Hours After and Ghost Buster's. After a lengthy break he returned to France in October for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse. Ridden by Tony Ives he took the lead approaching the straight and maintained his advantage until 200 metres from the finish, but then faded quickly and finished eighth of the twenty-four runners behind Tony Bin. On his fourth and final appearance of the year he was dropped in class and started odds-on favourite for the Group Three St Simon Stakes at Newbury but ran poorly and finished seventh, more than twenty lengths behind the winner Upend. =1989: four-year-old season= Emmson made his first appearance in the Gordon Richards Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse on 29 April and finished a remote sixth behind Indian Skimmer. In the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot in June he led until the final quarter mile before finishing third behind Assatis and Top Class. He was then dropped to Listed class for the Fred Archer Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 1 July and finished second to the four-year-old Apache. On 12 August the colt made his third appearance in France when he contested the Group Three Prix Gontaut-Biron over 2000 metres at Deauville Racecourse. With Carson in the saddle, he tracked the leader Hello Calder before taking the lead in the last 200 metres and stayed on well to win by three quarters of a length from Sweet Chesne. Carson received a four-day ban (later overturned) for causing interference but the result was allowed to stand. =1990: five-year-old season= Emmson remained in training as a five- year-old and was ridden in all three of his races by Alain Lequeux. He failed to recover his best form, finishing fifth in the Prix d'Harcourt, last of ten in the Prix Ganay and eighth in La Coupe in his final race on 23 June. Assessment In the official International Classification of two-year-olds for 1987, Emmson was given a rating of 118, seven pounds behind the top-rated pair Ravinella and Warning, making him the fifth best British juvenile colt. The independent Timeform organisation rated him on 123, four pounds inferior to Warning, who was their best two-year-old of the season. In their annual Racehorses of 1987 Timeform described him as a \\"very genuine\\" stayer who was likely to develop into a St Leger contender. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Emmson was exported to become a breeding stallion in Brazil. His last foals were born in 1997. His best runners included the filly Verruma and the colt Mr Pleasentfar, both of whom won Grade One races in Brazil before transferring to the United States: Verruma won the Athenia Stakes whilst Mr Pleasentfar won the Red Smith Handicap.

However, there is one big bridge across the Sesombe River. =Luveve-Silobela Road= Luveve- Nkayi Road ia a paved road officially called P8 Highway. It branches left at the same place Luveve-Donjane Road branches right. Luveve-Nkayi Road is also known as Kwekwe-Nkayi Road, but the road actually begins from the Kwekwe-Gokwe Highway at Luveve crossroads well outside Kwekwe.

Section 4.4: Institutional and social performance; Subsection 4.4.16: The Kwekwe-Gokwe road witnessed a remarkable traffic growth with rates higher than 7% AFDB  Operation Evaluation DepartmentRetrieved 6 February 2016 Both Zhombe Joel and Gokwe have experienced economic growth because of the impact of the feeder road. Road traffic statistics Although there is no railway line to Gokwe, the road network, courtesy of the main R847 Kwekwe- Gokwe, has proved excellent. Road vehicles of all kinds and sizes are increasing just as in bigger towns and cities. According to the project performance evaluation report of the Zimbabwe Rural Roads Project number 1, the flow of vehicles of all sizes in 1984 had an average of 131 per day. In 1991, when the tarred road was opened, the flow of such vehicles rose to 212 with a marked increase of heavy vehicles and buses. By 2011, the flow of vehicles was as high as 660 per day, with heavy goods vehicles topping the list at an average of 321 per day. Unlike other Zimbabwean highways, the R847 has no toll gates, but the flow of vehicles on the road per day has since doubled the 2011 averages, according to statistics elsewhere on major highways. In past years, the annual average daily traffic was done by traffic recording devices or by human observers who visually had to count and record traffic on tally sheets. However, at the fall of the Zimbabwean dollar the manned system was dropped only to come up later in the form of the toll gates system, which count vehicles by weight and generate revenue at the same time. The Kwekwe‚ÄìGokwe Highway is yet to have a toll gate. The increase of heavy vehicles spells the growth of business in Gokwe, Zhombe and other centers in the north-eastern parts of Matabeleland North Province. Beneficiaries =Settlements= The chief beneficiary of the R847 is Gokwe, which has become the newest town in Zimbabwe credit to the Kwekwe‚ÄìGokwe Highway.Urban Councils Association of Zimbabwe Gokwe Town Council Profile - HISTORY: Gokwe is relatively a new town which was established by statutory Instrument 170 of the 2006 proclamation 6 of 2006. The town evolved out of Gokwe South Rural District Council. Because of its rapid developmental rate it is one of the few urban settlements in Zimbabwe which graduated to a town direct from a Growth Point. Most urban centres have grown from a rural service centre to a local board, the lowest on the hierarchy of urban councils. www.ucaz.org Member Profiles Retrieved 6 February 2016 Zhombe Joel, CMB Nemangwe and Kabuyuni- Chitekete growth points have also grown to suburban standards.

The group actions are used to define models of human shape which accommodate variation. These orbits are deformable templates as originally formulated more abstractly in pattern theory.

The Manhattan Bridge Three Cent Line was a streetcar company that operated cars over the Manhattan Bridge between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Manhattan in New York City. As the name implied, the fare was only 3 cents per ride. History When the Manhattan Bridge was opened on December 31, 1909, it had tracks which were intended to be used by the subways of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT). There were no tracks on either side to connect them to, however. The MBTCL began to run streetcars in 1912, and until 1915 was the only operator of transit over the bridge. In 1915, the trolleys were moved to the upper roadways of the bridge, and the BRT subway lines were connected to the former MBTCL's tracks. The trackage was shared by the Brooklyn and North River RailroadStephen L.

The two track terminal at Fulton Street was shared with the Third Avenue Railway System cars that used the north tracks of the bridge. When the bridge first opened, the streetcars used what are now the subway tracks. When the BMT subway was ready to use the bridge, the streetcar tracks were relocated to the upper level, where auto roadways are over the subway tracks today. The MBTCL continued operating trolleys over the bridge until November 13, 1929, by which time patronage had declined due to the popularity of the automobile, as well as rapid transit. The line operated as a shuttle across the bridge using the south tracks of the bridge. The car house was still standing .

S. Gradshteyn and I. M. Ryzhik. Its full title today is Table of Integrals, Series, and Products. Since its first publication in 1943, it was considerably expanded and it soon became a \\"classic\\" and highly regarded reference for mathematicians, scientists and engineers. After the deaths of the original authors, the work was maintained and further expanded by other editors. At some stage a German and English dual-language translation became available, followed by Polish, English-only and Japanese versions. After several further editions, the Russian and German-English versions went out of print and have not been updated after the fall of the Iron Curtain, but the English version is still being actively maintained and refined by new editors, and it has recently been retranslated back into Russian as well. Overview One of the valuable characteristics of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik compared to similar compilations is that most listed integrals are referenced. The literature list contains 92 main entries and 140 additional entries (in the eighth English edition). The integrals are classified by numbers, which haven't changed from the fourth Russian up to the seventh English edition (the numbering in older editions as well as in the eighth English edition is not fully compatible). The book does not only contain the integrals, but also lists additional properties and related special functions. It also includes tables for integral transforms. Another advantage of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik compared to computer algebra systems is the fact that all special functions and constants used in the evaluation of the integrals are listed in a registry as well, thereby allowing reverse lookup of integrals based on special functions or constants. On the downsides, Gradshteyn and Ryzhik has become known to contain a relatively high number of typographical errors even in newer editions, which has repeatedly led to the publication of extensive errata lists. Earlier English editions were also criticized for their poor translation of mathematical terms and mediocre print quality.

The first edition, which contained about 5 000 formulas,Following the sources, this article distinguishes between the documented number of formulas and the number of entries. was authored by Ryzhik, who had already published a book on special functions in 1936 (160 pages.) and died during World War II in 1941. Not announcing this fact, his compilation was published posthumously in 1943, followed by a second corrected edition in his name in 1948.The fact that Ryzhik's death was not announced before the third edition of the book in 1951 might indicate that his status was unclear for a number of years, or, in the case of the first edition, that typesetting had already started, but actual production of the book had to be delayed and was then finalized in his absence as a consequence of the war. In the foreword of the first edition by Ryzhik, the author thanked three mathematicians of the Moscow Mathematical Society for their suggestions and advice: Vyacheslav Vassilievich Stepanov (), (), and Ilya Nikolaevich Bronshtein (). The third edition (1951) was worked on by Gradshteyn, who also introduced the chapter numbering system in decimal notation. Gradshteyn planned considerable expansion for the fourth edition, a work he could not finish due to his own death. Therefore, the fourth (1962/1963) and fifth (1971) editions were continued by Yuri Veniaminovich Geronimus (Russian: , German: )Yuri Veniaminovich Geronimus () (1923‚Äì2013), . and Michail Yulyevich Tseytlin (Russian: , German: ).Michail Yulyevich Tseytlin (), also as M. Yu. Ceitlin and M. Ju. Zeitlin, (?‚Äì). The fourth edition contained about 12 000 formulas already. Based on the third Russian edition, the first German-English edition with 5 400 formulas was published in 1957 by the East-German (DVW) with German translations by (1940‚Äì), . and (1930-07-28 to 2015-07-27), . and the English texts by . also as (1907-03-18 Pillau, Baltijsk, Ostpreu√üen ‚Äì 1978-05-17, East-Berlin, GDR), . In wrote: In 1963, it was followed by the second edition, a reprint edition with a four- page inlet listing corrections compiled by Eldon Robert Hansen. Derived from the 1963 edition, but considerably expanded, the third German-English edition by Ludwig Boll (1906‚Äì? or 1951?‚Äì1987), ? was finally published in 1981; it incorporated the material of the fifth Russian edition (1971) as well. Pending this third German-English edition an English-only edition by Alan JeffreyAlan Jeffrey (1929-07-16 to 2010-06-06), . was published in 1965. Lacking a clear designation by itself it was variously known as first, third or fourth English edition, as it was based on the then-current fourth Russian edition. The formulas were photographically reproduced and the text translated. This still held true for the expanded fourth English edition in 1980, which added chapters 10 to 17. Both of these editions saw multiple print runs each incorporating newly found corrections. Starting with the third printing, updated table entries were marked by adding a small superscript number to the entry number indicating the corresponding print run (\\"3\\" etc.), a convention carried over into later editions by continuing to increase the superscript number as kind of a revision number (no longer directly corresponding with actual print runs). The fifth edition (1994), which contained close to 20 000 formulas, was electronically reset in preparation for a CD-ROM issue of the fifth edition (1996) and in anticipation of further editions. Since the sixth edition (2000), now corresponding with superscript number \\"10\\", Daniel ZwillingerDaniel Zwillinger (1957‚Äì), . started contributing as well. The last edition being edited by Jeffrey before his death was the seventh English edition published in 2007 (with superscript number \\"11\\"). This edition has been retranslated back into Russian as \\"seventh Russian edition\\" in 2011. For the eighth edition (2014/2015, with superscript number \\"12\\") Zwillinger took over the role of the editor. He was assisted by . (1956‚Äì), . In order to make room for additional information without increasing the size of the book significantly, the former chapters 11 (on algebraic inequalities), chapters 13 to 16 (on matrices and related results, determinants, norms, ordinary differential equations) and chapter 18 (on z-transforms) worth about 50 pages in total were removed and some chapters renumbered (12 to 11, 17 to 12). This edition contains more than 10 000 entries. Related projects In 1995, Alan Jeffrey published his Handbook of Mathematical Formulas and Integrals. It was partially based on the fifth English edition of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik's Table of Integrals, Series, and Products and meant as an companion, but written to be more accessible for students and practitioners. It went through four editions up to 2008. (NB.

Inspired by a 1988 paper in which proved several integrals in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik Victor Hugo Moll with George Boros started a project to prove all integrals listed in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik and add additional commentary and references. In the foreword of the book Irresistible Integrals (2004), they wrote: (NB. This edition contains many typographical errors.)

It includes a small group of civic and commercial buildings around the junction of Main Street (Vermont Route 7A) and Union Street, with the luxury Equinox House hotel as its primary focus. The district, developed as a tourist destination in the late 1800s, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and enlarged in 1980. It is a small portion of the Manchester Village Historic District. Description and history Manchester is a town in northern Bennington County, Vermont, with its village center on the east side of Equinox Mountain. The heart of the village is at the junction of Vermont 7A, formerly the major north‚Äìsouth route through the area, and Union Street, which extends east toward the Battenkill River. The area has long been known for the spa waters that came down from the mountain, and has since the mid-19th century been a tourist destination. The Equinox Hotel, one of Vermont's few surviving 19th-century grand hotels, anchors the west side of the village, and has catered to many prominent visitors over its long history. Prominent guests included Mary Todd Lincoln and her son Robert, who later built the Hildene estate to the south, and Ulysses S. Grant. Across Main Street from the hotel, facing either Main Street or Union Street, are a number of civic and commercial buildings, all built before 1872. Notable among these are the First Congregation Church, built in 1871 and the town's tallest building, and the Bennington County Courthouse (1822). Of commercial note is the Orvis Building, where in 1856 Charles Orvis founded the eponymous company that dominates the fly-fishing market. A number of the buildings in the center are associated with the Orvises, who were an economically significant force in the town for many years. The Equinox Hotel was listed on the National Register in 1972. In 1980 the listing was enlarged to include the other buildings; all of these are also contributing elements to the Manchester Village Historic District.

She has won numerous awards and recognition throughout her career including the Vanguardia Nacional, the Distinci√≥n por la Cultura Nacional (Distinction of the National Culture), and the Alejo Carpentier Medal. In 2014, she was honored as the recipient of the National Dance Prize of Cuba. Biography Silvina Fabars Gilall was born on 22 February 1944 in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba. Her ancestry includes grandparents from Guinea and Ghana, who helped raise her. As a child, she was taught to read and write by an aunt and was only able to attend elementary school for 2 or three years, as her labor was needed. She worked in the cane fields, planted sweet potatoes, picked coffee and hauled wood and water. She lived in a community of Haitians and learned their folk dances and patois. At the age of fourteen, she joined Fidel Castro's rebel army in the Sierra Maestra and participated in the Cuban Revolution. In 1959, she began working at the airport in San Antonio de los Banos as a member of the legendary Mariana Grajales Women's Squad. Around the same time, she co-founded the first Cuban folk dancing company, known as the Ballet Folkl√≥rico de Oriente (Eastern Folk Dancing Company), where she performed as a singer and dancer until 1965. In 1966, Fabars was invited by the playwright and theater director, Eugenio Hern√°ndez Espinosa, to come to Havana and try out for the National Folkloric Ensemble () (CFN). She was hired as a singer, but after a serious accident which damaged her vocal chords, was offered a position as a hairdresser or makeup artist. Fabars was determined to continue performing as a dancer. Unfamiliar with the folk dances and traditions of the western part of Cuba, she studied with the anthropologist Fernando Ortiz Fern√°ndez, as well as many of the company's premier dancers, such as Santiago Alfonso, Luisa Barroso, Nieves Fresneda, Zenaida Hernandez and Emilio O‚ÄôFarrill. By 1978, she was offered a professorship to teach dance and the following year, she became the principal dancer of the CFN. Some of her most noted performances include Yoruba Iyess√° by the Mexican choreographer Rodolfo Reyes Cort√©s, which became a signature piece for Fabars; Ciclo Congo; Arara, which features spinning movements with a basket on her head; and Rumbas y comparsas, in which she was the zebra. She has performed in most of the repertoire productions of the CFN and has performed throughout the world, including in Algeria, Angola, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, England, France, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Martinique, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Spain, and the United States. In addition to teaching at the CFN, Fabars has taught throughout the country and helped establish groups and dance companies. As a teacher for the International Laboratory of Cuban Folklore which is a biannual course offered to teach Cuban dance, she has taught at the University of Alberta, in Canada; University of Liverpool and University of London in England; at the Tokyo Cultural Center of Japan, as well as in Cuba, Russia and Venezuela. She spent two years in Venezuela helping the ministry of culture develop a folk dance company before returning to Cuba and establishing a folk dance training facility at the House of Culture in Camag√ºey, where she currently teaches. Throughout her career, Fabars has won many honors. As part of the CFN, she has shared in awards which include the Golden Sandal trophy from Festidanza 1974 held in Arequipa, Peru; in the Golden Barrel and Silver Necklace awarded by the 30th International Vineyard Festivities of Dijon, France (1975); the Silver Platter from the 1976 Billingham Folkloric Festival of Billingham, England; and the Golden Temple trophy from the 1988 Almond Blossom Festival of Agrigento, Sicily, among many others. Her individual awards include the Vanguardia Nacional (National Vanguard), the Distinci√≥n por la Cultura Nacional (Distinction of the National Culture), and the Alejo Carpentier Medal. In 2014, she was honored as the recipient of the National Dance Prize of Cuba.

Synopsis  After the fall of Denmark and Norway in 1940, Nazi Germany looked at Iceland as its next conquest. The island nation could control the North Atlantic sea lanes and was seen as a staging point to also occupy nearby Greenland. In setting up bases at Iceland and Greenland, Luftwaffe bombers could threaten Canada with Newfoundland only three hours flight time away, Halifax, five hours away and even the industrial heartland of Canada was only seven hours from Greenland. To fortify the island defences, British and Canadian troops secured Iceland in May 1940. Convoys rapidly unloaded troops and supplies to support a Canadian mission. The troops brought all the mat√©riel to become completely independent, including trucks, coal, lumber and massive coastal guns to be erected at the island's coastline to guard the approaches to Iceland. After setting up tents, the Canadian troops built more permanent Nissen huts, and established bases on the island. With the Royal Navy and Fleet Air Arm providing naval resources and Canadian troops stationed at the strategic outpost, Iceland no longer posed a danger to the convoys of the North Atlantic.

Offered the opportunity to evacuate the island in June 1940, most locally born islanders decided to stay. The remaining 470 civilians would be subject to German rule for the next five years, until Sark was liberated on 10 May 1945. The main contact between the Sark residents and the German authorities in 1940 was 56-year old Sibyl Hathaway, the Dame of Sark, who was Seigneur of Sark (feudal lord) from 1927 until her death in 1974. Aerial view of Sark Early war Britain had declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939 and since then a number of islanders had left to volunteer for the armed services in England. A total of 27 people joined the armed services from Sark and one of those would be killed before the war ended. Sark was prepared; 70 year-old John Perrio, armed with a rifle and dressed in a kilt, tunic and gumboots would ride his donkey \\"Clarabelle\\" around Brecqhou every day, according to a Fleet Street journalist, and somewhere on the island was a small supply of gunpowder for the old cannon on the cliff top. In May 1940, with the fall of France imminent, the British Government suggested that there should be an evacuation of all who wished to leave. Sibyl Hathaway, as Dame of Sark, had declared to a public meeting that she and her husband, Robert Hathaway, an American citizen and legally the co-ruler, would be staying on Sark and that she did not think the Germans would bother the island and even if they did, would not stay long and as the islands would provide enough food, there was no need to leave. This persuaded many people to stay, including most local born people. A number of English-born people did decide to go, some on ferries via Guernsey and some on private boats. One who left was the island's only doctor. On 28 June Guernsey and Jersey were bombed, the Heinkel He 111s having flown low over Sark. They also machine gunned Sark fishing boats. German troops landed in Guernsey and Jersey a few days later with no fighting as the islands had been demilitarised and declared open towns. = Occupation = Sibyl Hathaway in 1945 Seigneurie ‚Äì Sark The Guernsey lifeboat arrived on 3 July carrying three German officers. Major Doctor Albrecht Lanz, the commandant of Guernsey, was accompanied by Major Maass, who could speak English. They were told by the Seneschal that no carriage was available and they had to walk up the hill and across the Island to La Seigneurie, the home of Sibyl Hathaway, where she did them the honour of receiving them. By playing on the etiquette of the old school German officers, she would manage throughout the war to control meetings, expecting the officers to bow to her and kiss her hand; How the World‚Äôs Only Feudal Lord Outclassed the Nazis to Save Her People. Dame Sibyl Hathaway protected her people with the unlikeliest of weapons: Feudal etiquette, old-world manners, and a dollop of classic snobbery. by Lucas Reilly, Mental Floss, November 6, 2018 via getpocket.com, accessed May 10, 2020. this was to be an advantage for the islanders. Sibyl Hathaway had worked in Germany and spoke German well, so could converse clearly with them. Also arriving on the lifeboat was a squad of 10 German troops under an NCO who established themselves, with a flag, in the Hotel Bel Air at the top of Harbour Hill. One of Hathaway's early victories was to get agreement for a German doctor to be based in Sark who would treat the locals as well as the soldiers that would be based on the island. On 8 July 1940, a British Commando raid, Operation Ambassador, was supposed to land troops in Guernsey. One party of No.11 Independent Company were taken to the wrong island (Sark) as a result of a faulty compass; landing on Little Sark, the team explored La Sablonnerie and, not finding any Germans, returned safely to the destroyer. =Civilian life= As in the other islands, the German rules and regulations applied to Sark, including blackouts, curfews, opening hours of public houses, fishing, etc. but not the rules regarding motor cars, as Sark did not have any. Fishing was an important business in Sark and permission was given to fish within and for two boats to travel to Guernsey to sell their catches and bring back petrol for the boats. Once a week the boats would call into Herm and Jethou to deliver supplies. The German soft occupation attitude resulted in Sark people treating the small number of Germans more as tourists, soldiers would be invited to dinner and everyone met in the Mermaid Tavern. The Guernsey cricket team came to the island in 1940 for a local match. The Sark Sports games took place as normal. The Germans would behave in a very proper manner throughout the occupation. The SS Staffa sailed from Guernsey to Sark three times weekly, carrying essentials including paraffin, coal and flour. She was later replaced by the MV Sheilla and then by the White Heather. Sark, like all occupied countries, was obliged to pay for the occupation, which was difficult as Sark had no form of direct taxation on people or businesses, and the number of Germans in the island was increasing. The confiscation of 180 radios in November 1940 did not affect the morale in Sark as much as elsewhere as not many radios existed, many civilians spoke their local patois, Sercquiais, rather than English and were not interested in the BBC. Even so, a few radios were kept back, as were crystal sets. The radios were returned on 14 December. Christmas Eve was celebrated together, with decorations, music and carols sung by both groups. The Germans joined in the circle on New Year's Eve at midnight to sing \\"Auld Lang Syne\\", before firing their weapons to welcome the new year. Continuing occupation =1941= Sark ‚Äì land area The soldiers were regularly rotated and additional soldiers arrived bringing the total to 200 including a more high handed group of bureaucrats, issuing orders that were often restrictive and illogical, such as limiting fishing times without paying attention to tide tables, resulting in a fall in the fish catch. Later in the year they came to their senses and began listening to advice from Sibyl Hathaway before issuing even more orders, making restrictions milder in Sark than elsewhere. Islanders found they could argue with Germans about where they did or did not put barbed wire and machine gun positions, and win, fearing that Sibyl Hathaway might appeal to her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù German commandant Colonel Rudolf Graf von Schmettow. The first Red Cross messages arrived on 16 February 1941. A July message informed Sibyl Hathaway that her son had been killed in a bombing raid in Liverpool. Shortages in shops became very noticeable and everyone concentrated on producing food. Trying replacements for missing items like tea and tobacco. It was hard work to carry salt water all the way from Creux Harbour so vegetables could be boiled in it as salt was not available. People were hungry and losing weight. The year progressed with a fair amount of fraternisation, evenings in pubs and dances with local girls created a relaxed atmosphere. The Germans would play soccer against a Sark team. Sark was still open to tourists, be it now limited to just Guernsey holidaymakers. Identity cards were introduced in July. The Channel Island ‚Äúpurchasing commission‚Äù based in Granville acquired what goods they could for Sark, based on their urgent shopping lists of essential supplies, what was available in France and the amount of cash they had been given. German antisemitic orders only applied to one person on Sark, the Czech Jewish Annie Wranowsky. She became the German language teacher on Sark, avoided deportation, and continued with her job. The Germans imported a few motor vehicles as well as draught horses as they began work on fortifying the island. Minefields were gradually established on beaches and cliff paths. Germans ordered anyone with a horse and cart to help transport military goods around the island. Brecqhou had been evacuated. A number of houses were demolished, or as they were of wooden construction, taken down and moved elsewhere. =1942= Visitors no longer arrived and the only excuse for a local to visit Guernsey was toothache, as Sark had no dentist. Fake toothache became common so people could spend a few days off island, maybe to visit a cinema. German soldiers managed to set fire to their headquarters, the Hotel Bel Air, which was burnt to the ground. Headquarters changed to Le Manoir. In April, the German doctor, Dr Gobelle was found robbed and murdered in bed. Sark residents were questioned, then his Hungarian batman went missing; the residents were questioned again for hiding the man and severe restrictions were imposed. After two weeks, the batman was found dead in the bottom of a deep well, suicide was suspected. A German NCO was suspected of the murder of the doctor. Radios, as in the other islands, were confiscated again, this time for the duration of the occupation. In September a German order was issued to send all men of English parents to camps in Germany. Interpreted by Sibyl Hathaway to mean non-Sark born people, the initial list was reduced leaving just 11. Two people did not turn up for the boat so just 9 were sent to Guernsey. The missing two were found, they had tried to commit suicide, the husband, a retired British Major was dead but his wife eventually recovered. Single men were sent to Ilag VII in Laufen which is located in Bavaria, joining many other deportees from the Channel Islands Another British commando raid, this one intending to land on Sark, Operation Basalt, comprising 12 men arrived on 3‚Äì4 October 1942 by MTB with the objective of capturing a prisoner, landing on the east of the island they climbed the cliffs onto the 'Hogs Back' and followed a thin track towards the island's interior. The Commandos marked their route with luminous paint to aid their return. After looking at one empty house, traversing a valley and climbing to the other side they broke into another house, the lady there (Mrs Pittard, recent widow of the Sark Doctor) directed them to the Dixcart Hotel, where after killing a sentry they forced entry and found five sleeping German military engineers. The small force took them prisoners and tied their hands, but the prisoners started shouting and then fighting. One German ran away towards the nearby Stock's Hotel where other garrison troops were sleeping. The struggle broke into fighting and the others were shot. Only one German was taken back to the MTB and the British escaped. Three German soldiers died. Mrs Pittard was sent to prison in Guernsey for three months. before being deported to Germany. The Sark commander, Oberleutnant Stefan Herdt lost his command for fraternization and failure in the commando raid. A few days after this event Hitler issued his Commando Order whereby Allied commandos would be treated like bandits and eliminated. The 1,376 POW‚Äôs taken in the recent Dieppe Raid were handcuffed by the Germans, this was followed by handcuffing German POW‚Äôs in Canada. Around 100 commandos who were captured in future raids in Europe were executed. 1942 deportation notice Sark was now a front line in the war, Major Johann Hinkel, the new commander had 13,107 mines laid, access to beaches was blocked and additional troops arrived taking the total to around 500. Anti aircraft guns and an anti tank gun were installed on the island. The 3.7 cm Pak 36 gun providing defence against shipping as did two 10.5 cm K 331(f) in field positions. An Avro Lancaster bomber crashed at night near La Seigneurie on 23 November having run out of fuel. Some of the crew had bailed out over France. Three RAF men were captured and taken to Guernsey. Unlike in the other islands, islanders went outside to look if a plane was heard, as it seemed inconceivable that Sark would be bombed. Nobody had an air raid shelter, or a gas mask. =1943= February brought a second batch of deportees, originally 60, it was reduced to 25 including the vicar, a family with seven children and a family with nine children and their elderly grandmother. The German commanders were not happy with the deportations, but the orders came direct from Hitler. Robert Hathaway the Seigneur of Sark, was amongst the deportees. Families went to Oflag V-B was located at Biberach an der Ri√ü in countryside in southern Germany with a view of the Bavarian Alps. The German commandant was killed in March when he stepped on a mine. Fifty minefields had been laid, including fields closely encircling the village. A four year old was also killed when she walked into a minefield. With fishing the main source of food, one resident complained of having to eat lobster every day. There were 120 cattle so milk was sufficient for half a pint per person per day, farmers were also growing produce on and kept chickens and rabbits. All this and more was needed to feed the 400 islanders and the quota that went to the 500 soldiers. Most meat, apart from pork and rabbit had to come from Guernsey. In September the German garrison on Sark was reduced by 150. Fuel was a problem, coal was unobtainable, trees are in short supply in Sark, dried seaweed could not be collected after the commando raid closed the beaches and collecting furze became impossible after the mines were laid. Germans were pulling down wooden houses for fuel. Electricity was not available except in a few houses and candles were unobtainable. Fishermen made a machine from Lancaster pieces, to make rope which was unobtainable. Just after Christmas 1943 saw a third British commando raid Operation Hardtack was a series of commando raids in the Channel Islands. Hardtack 7 was a raid on Sark. The team failed to climb the cliffs on the first attempt and withdrew. Returning the next night they walked into a minefield, two were killed and most of the others were wounded but made their escape in canoes. The two men, thought by the Germans to be Canadians, when in fact they were Free French, Pte Andre Dignac and Cpl. R Bellamy, were buried in Sark. Late war =1944= There was the Guernsey Underground News Sheet (which went by the acronym GUNS) which published BBC news, illegally received, on a single news sheet from May 1942. The baker on Sark, Hubert Lanyon would be sent three copies to pass on, however in February 1944 the Guernsey team was discovered and the baker was ‚Äúinterviewed‚Äù by the Wehrmacht Feldgendarmerie until unconscious, but did not reveal his accomplices. He received a sentence of six months in prison, later reduced on appeal to four months. He survived, but two of the GUNS team died in prison. The night of 5‚Äì6 June 1944 was full of engine noises as American planes carrying paratroopers passed overhead. People listened to their crystal sets next day for news. By 22 June Americans were on the French coast just away. Three recovered 8.8 cm SK C/35 naval guns were emplaced in Little Sark as Batterie Klein-Sark for use in an anti-shipping roll. When Cherbourg and St Malo fell to the Americans, the islands were cut off and both civilian and German rations were reduced. In retaliation Sibyl Hathaway and a few helpers raided the German supply in the Village Hall and took away a ton of grain on a cart, the mill at La Seigneurie ground the grain into flour and it was distributed successfully. At the very end of 1944 the Red Cross ship SS Vega arrived in Guernsey. =1945= In January a number of Red Cross parcels were shipped to Sark and distributed amongst the civilians. Sark would receive several additional Red Cross parcel deliveries before the war ended; they probably saved a number of lives. German soldiers now had less to eat than the civilians and were fainting in the streets and searching for plant roots they could boil. Mincing nettles made them easier to eat. Rabbits, cats and dogs continued to vanish. With Hitler dead, the war ended within 10 days, Sibyl Hathaway hoisted the British and American flags and called the islanders together to listen to Churchill‚Äôs speech at 3pm on 8 May. The Germans locked themselves away in their barracks. A victory bonfire lit on the cliffs on Sark on 9 May caused concern in Guernsey, resulting in 10 British soldiers arriving on Sark on 10 May to formally accept the German surrender. Not having sufficient British troops available, Sibyl Hathaway was put in charge of the 270 German soldiers.  Post war  Sark Coupee The Dame of Sark ordered the immediate lifting of mines, two Germans were killed from amongst the soldiers who were retained in Sark after the war to remove the mines. The soldiers also built the concrete road along the Coupee, which joins Little Sark to main Sark, under supervision by the Royal Engineers. The British brought a few motor vehicles over themselves before all vehicles were removed. Many Sark residents had bitterly resented Sibyl Hathaway for the decision to remain on Sark during the ensuing five years of occupation, but thanked her after the war when they saw how total evacuation destroyed the way of life on the neighbouring island of Alderney. Sibyl Hathaway was much respected by the islanders as well as the Germans, for the leadership she gave during this period. The British Home Secretary Herbert Morrison observed that she remained \\"almost wholly mistress of the situation\\" throughout the occupation. The deportees and service personnel returned to an island, which once cleared of mines and barbed wire, had changed little during the war. The islanders also seemed to have escaped most of the moral problems caused by separation, experienced by the larger islands as family units had stayed intact. Later than other Channel Island leaders during the war, the Dame of Sark, Sibyl Hathaway was honoured by being made an Ordinary Officer of the Civil Division of the Order of the British Empire in June 1949, days before a visit by Princess Elizabeth to Sark. In 1965, on the 400th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth I's grant of charter signed in 1565, she was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

S S G S ","title":"Sark during the German occupation of the Channel Islands"},{"id":"49343645","text":"The Step Inn pub bombing was a car bomb attack carried out by the Glenanne gang, an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group. The attack occurred outside the Step Inn Pub in Keady, County Armagh, when the pub was packed with people. The Ulster Volunteer Force claimed responsibility for the bomb attack. Background After the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) ceasefire of 1975, attacks on the British security forces decreased, but loyalist paramilitaries, fearing they were about to be sold out by the British government and forced into a united Ireland, stepped up their campaign of sectarian killings of innocent Catholic civilians. Some Glenanne gang attacks of this period were the 31 July 1975 Miami Showband killings (in which three members of the popular showband were killed, along with two of the gang members carrying out the attack who were killed by their own bomb while priming it), and the 4 January 1976 Reavey and O'Dowd killings, when gunmen killed three members of the Reavey family and three members of the O'Dowd family. The bombing Catholic civilians Elizabeth McDonald and Gerard McGleenon were killed and about 15 - 20 were injured. Ten days before the bombing, the RUC asked the British Army to put James Mitchell's farmhouse (a farmhouse used by the Glenanne gang) under surveillance because they had intelligence that a bomb was being stored there. According to John Weir, the bomb was to be detonated at Renaghan's Bar across the border in Clontibret, County Monaghan. On 15 August, Weir scouted the route to the pub but was stopped by Garda√≠, who told him they were mounting extra security due to a warning from the RUC. Weir told the rest of the gang and they decided to attack Keady instead. The British Army surveillance operation was ended and the bomb attack went ahead. Weir, Mitchell and the others (all alleged members of the Glenanne gang) involved were not arrested and were allowed to remain in the RUC. Aftermath and discovery of collusion Serving police officers later admitted involvement in the attack. Senior policemen knew about the planned attack but failed to prevent the bombing and covered up their knowledge during the subsequent police investigation. The families of Elizabeth McDonald and Gerard McGleenan, who were killed in the attack, are being supported in their inquiries by the Pat Finucane Centre while the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) investigations discovered that RUC Special Branch received reliable intelligence that UVF members had a bomb ready for use in County Armagh 10 days before the attack. They also reveal that the RUC failed to make any arrests despite knowing the names of several of those involved in the bombing ‚Äì among them RUC officers, who were not questioned. In 2015, Sinn F√©in MLA Mickey Brady said the preliminary inquests into the killings of Elizabeth McDonald and Gerard McGleenan at the Step Inn must not be delayed, given that HET described the RUC‚Äôs handling of the case as \\"catastrophic\\".

Ranawat, P. S., 2014. . Kumbha Exclusives, India. by Maharana Udai Singh II in the fertile circular Girwa Valley to the southwest of Nagda, on the Banas River. The city was established as the new capital of the Mewar kingdom.  Overview  =Founding of Udaipur= The golden period of glory of Chittaurgarh that began with Bappa Rawal (734CE) and continued under Rawals Khumaans to Maharana Sanga (Sangram Singh 1509-1527) lost its prominence after Sanga's death. Sanga was succeeded by his two unworthy sons, during whose brief rule (1527-1536) even the nobles of the kingdom lost interest in its affairs and plunged Chittaurgarh into a period of disaster and decline. The third son of Sanga fortunately salvaged the situation through rational and enterprising rule. The political situation in India was changing fast which the young Maharana had to contend with. =Portuguese Empire= The Portuguese established themselves on the western coast of India with the new weapon of warfare-the artillery, they established themselves on the western coast of India-starting in 1509 with construction of ports and forts at Calicut, Cochin, Pulicat (Podouke), Goa, Bombay, Cambay, Diu, and finally arriving in Gujarat by the 1530s. The Mughal emperor Babur established himself in the north in 1526. He too, took recourse to the new technology of artillery. With the help of Portuguese, Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, successfully tried and tested the efficacy of artillery warfare on Chittaurgarh in 1535. It resulted in the Second Saka and Jauhar. It is quite likely that the concept of Saabaat (‡§∏‡§æ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§)-covered corridors leading up to the fort walls-was suggested by the Portuguese who must have surely accompanied the Sultan. They wanted to impress the Muslim ruler with a view to getting foot-hold on Gujarat coast. They were also the first \\"traders\\" of gunpowder and cannon in India. This aspect needs consideration especially in relation to the general perception that Babur introduced artillery warfare in India. In fact Portuguese beat the Mughal ruler by a quarter century! With this background of a hostile and volatile north, a southern kingdom armed with new technology and his own house in disorder, Maharana Udai Singh wisely decided to adjust to the changed situation in and around Mewar with \\"Krishn-Neeti\\" (rational policy). =Capital relocation= The Maharana was also aware of the known ambitious and expansionist designs of the young grandson of Babur, he therefore decided to relocate his capital from venerable but vulnerable Chittaurgarh to a more appropriate location. Founding of Udaipur was one of the greatest achievements of Maharana Udai Singh-a decision that had far-reaching consequence on the future history of this area and its people. Unfortunately, the \\"story\\" of its founding is based on what earlier literature including \\"Veer Vinod\\" described without interpreting and analyzing it in more rational manner. Subsequent writers, especially \\"Tourist\\" literature, have just retold the same thing in their own words without evaluating the facts of the case. The usual story is: Maharana Udai Singh visits Kailashpuri to pay respect and to thank the family deity, Shree Eklingji, on the birth of his grandson-Amar Singh (16 March 1559, Chaitra Shukl Saptami VS 1616). On return to Girwa they have an \\"Aakhaa-Teej\\" hunting excursion during which they meet a hermit on the ridge overlooking Pichola Lake, who advises him to establish his capital here and next day the Hermit disappears....Fact of the matter is: =17 rulers of Mewar= 17 rulers of Mewar had ruled from Ayad town of Girwa Valley (~10th -12th centuries, Ruler #18-34), still earlier (4+1) Rawals ruled from Nagda; so the \\"Girwa\\" (& adjoining) valley was already well known to Chittaurgarh rulers who returned to it whenever Chittaurgarh was lost to invaders-the Rajputs or the Muslims! =Strategic location= The oval amphitheater/arena Girwa Valley (~20 km x 15 km), in which Udaipur was founded, has its long axis in NW-SE extending between ~N24¬∞40Ãí - 24¬∞34Ãí and E73 ¬∞39 Ãí - E73 ¬∞ 45 Ãí, the undulating but fertile valley floor has elevation of ~580m which is encircled by continuous hill range having MRL of ~ 670-850m that are thickly forested. The valley, at the eastern flank of the Aravalli Hill Range, was fed by two perennial rivers -Ayad and Sisarma, they merge further downstream to form Bedach River. This strategically located Girwa valley is endowed with a natural defense system, which made it as an ideal location for human settlement. To the west of Girwa Valley, there is a densely forested hill range and to its east is the ~100-km wide Mewar plain followed by Vindhyan plateau Range from Chittaurgarh & beyond Ayad area of Girwa Valley has been inhabited from pre-historic times. The remains of ~4000 year-old civilization have been excavated at \\"Dhoolkot\\" (mud- wall/mound). Dhoolkot is still shrouded in mystery, however! But during historic times Ayad was a prosperous trading town of Mewar dealing with traders of Malwa, Gujarat and north India. Over the period of time it was called by various names viz.: Tambavati Nagri/Aatpur/Aaghatpur/ Ahaad. It was the capital of Mewar for nearly 200 years, [#18 Rawal Narvahan (971 CE) to (# 34) Rawal Kshem Singh (1168 CE); thereafter Rawal Jaitra Singh (1213-1253 CE) ruling from Nagda reclaimed Chittaurgarh. =Palace= The modest palace of Rawal rulers (Rawalaan ro rawlo ‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§∞‡•ã ‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡§≥‡•ã) was located where the present-day Mahasatiya (the great truth-the royal cremation ground) was developed after the demise of Maharana Amar Singh in 1620. This area also has a large (40 x 40 m) elegantly built step-well the \\"Gangodbhav-Kund\\" (‡§ó‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ã‡§¶‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§° a pre-944CE structure) for community water source and a smaller well with Shiv temple encircled by open corridors nearby. There are temples of Surya, Vishnu, Brahma, Varaha, Chamunda...Besides these Hindu temples, there is also a mosque. To the south of Rawla, there is a very prominent Jain temple complex spread over an area of ~ 1ha. =Jainism temple = A renowned Jain Acharya Yashobhadra Suriji (‡§Ü‡§ö‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§Ø‡§∂‡•ã‡§≠‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ú‡•Ä) established the Jain temple dedicated to Tirthankar Pasharvanath in VS 1029 (972 CE) during the reign of Rawal Narvahan Singh. Thereafter, during the reign of Rawal Jaitra Singh (VS1270-1309) Acharya Jagchandra Suriji stayed at Ayad. He debated with and defeated the religious pundits. As a recognition of his feats, he was conferred the title of \\"Tap-Hirla\\" (‡§§‡§™ ‡§π‡§ø‡§∞‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∞‡•Ç‡§¶ ‡§Ö‡§≤‡§Ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§ ‡§µ‡•à‡§∂‡§æ‡§ñ ‡§∂‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§≤ 3, VS 1285). Consequently, he got constructed four large temples of Supasharvanath ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•Å‡§™‡§æ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡§æ‡§•, Sankheshwar -Pasharvanath ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∂‡§Ç‡§ñ‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞ ‡§™‡§æ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡§æ‡§•, Adinath ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§¶‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§•, and Shantinath ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§• in an area of ~2700 sq m which have now been restored to their past glory. This information is based on a manuscript which was written by Mewar ruler's Mantri (Minister) Shravak Hemchand Shershthi ‚Äì‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡§ï ‡§π‡•à‡§Æ‡§ö‡§®‡•ç‡§¶ ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡•Ä-that are preserved at Shantinath Gyan Bhandaar, Khambat (Cambay, Gujarat). Rawal Vair (i) Singh constructed the ramparts of Ayad (1103CE). On the northern bank of Ayad River and south of Ayad dwellings is located the cremation ground for the Ayad dwellers. The same ground in the nearby area must have been used for the Royal Rawal family members too. Thus Ayad town had all the components of a well organized dwelling center of long standing with multi-cultural setting. As were the Sisoda (‡§∏‡•Ä‡§∏‡•ã‡§¶‡§æ) dwelling Guhilot came to be known as Sisodiya (‡§∏‡§ø‡§∏‡•ã‡§¶‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ), likewise, the Ayad (Ahaad ‡§Ü‡§π‡§æ‡§°‡§º) dwelling Guhilot came to be known as \\"Ahadaa\\" (‡§Ü‡§π‡§æ‡§°‡§º‡§æ), Rawal Samant Singh (1197 CE) who moved to Dungarpur and its later branch Banswara (1527) are known as Ahadaa Guhilot. =Western Girwa Valley= The western part of Girwa Valley was also possibly sparsely inhabited, which is evident from the discovery of a shila-lekh (rock inscription) near Hasti Mata Temple. It describe the times of Rawal Shakti Kumar (977CE). Likewise, there is a shila-lekh of Rawal Allat (953CE) at the Shaandeshwar Temple near the present-day Ashoknagar cremation ground (shmashƒÅna or smashaan). With this background information and the tragic memory of the Second Saka & Jauhar (1535) and Sher Shah Suri's campaign (1544), fresh in his mind, Maharana Udai Singh was firmly of the view that under the changed artillery warfare of his time, it is wise to \\"get back to the hills\\". He had realized the advantages of the hilly areas when he was residing in exile at Kumbhalgarh. His guardian \\"Kileydaar\\" (Fort In-Charge) Asha Shah Devpura and foster-mother Panna Dhai must have told him of the terrain advantages utilized by Rana Hameer and the family of adjoining village Sisoda. When Maharana Udai Singh was faced with the emergence of Mughal rule in the north, he rightly realized that sooner than later the situations like the ones of the siege of Bahadur Shah or the campaign of Sher Shah Suri may arise. =Shifting the capital= So he decided to shift the capital from venerable but vulnerable Chittaurgarh back to secure Girwa Valley. He rightly chose, as suggested by the hermit Goswami Premgiriji, to locate his palace on the ~N-S trending ridge east of the Pichola Lake which was sloping in NE direction. From there it provided a more commanding view of the valley. Besides, it had adequate water resources for the proposed capital last but the area was not flood-prone as was the Ayad town. This location ~5 km west of Ayad town also had a high hill -Machala Magra- with strategic view which could be used for newly-emerging artillery defense of his new capital. As per the Chittaud-Udaipur Patnama of Badwa Dalichand, a fortress named Udaigadh as constructed atop this strategic hill in which a crocodile-faced cannon ‚Äì Udaibaan was also set up. Taking all these aspects into consideration Maharana Udai Singh founded the city on the auspicious Aakhaa-Teej day of 1553 CE (in Kriti Nakshatra, Akshay Tritiya, Vaishaakh Sudi Teej, VS 1609, Saturday- 15 April 1553), this has been approved by the high level official committee The city of Udaipur is protected by a double defense system. The Girwa Valley surrounded by hills form the natural defense. The city is further protected by 3 gates and fortified walls towards the East, the North, and the South along the established trade routes. The outer entry gate and defense wall at the eastern flat area entry to the new city was constructed at the 15-km end of Girwa Valley at Debari (Dev-Bari/Debari-ka-Darwaza) on Sunday the Ashaadh Vidhi Teej of VS 1610 (20 May 1554). Proactive role of the Maharanees in the construction of the new capital is manifested by the facts: * In 1555 the Patvi (eldest) Maharani Songariji constructed a step-well and Sarai (tavern/rest-house for travelers) at Debari Gate; * Maharani Sajjadevi (Suja Kunwar/Sajjabaiji d/o Rao Prithviraj Solanki of Toda) built the Prahaladrai Temple on the bank of Udaisagar. Maharana Udai Singh also constructed a major masonry dam to the east of the capital city which was also named after him as Udaisagar. Its work started on Aakhaa-Teej of 1559 CE and the construction was completed in 6 years. The dam was commissioned on 4 April 1565. Its religious ceremony was performed by Bhatt Cheethuji, who was granted the village Bhoorwada for this work. After festivity and \\"Tula-Daan\\", the Maharana along with his Maharanees performed \\"parikrama\\" (going around the lake) in palkees (palanquins). The lake provided additional water resource, essentially for irrigation, but more importantly it effectively blocked the ONLY flat ground/pass/gap leading \\"into\\" the Girwa Valley (rest of the entry points into Girwa Valley were through hill passes). =Construction of dam= Because Dewda Rajput families owned agriculture land that would be submerged in Udaisagar, they opposed the construction of this dam. But Maharana Udai Singh tackled the situation tactfully but firmly to see this strategic project through. He granted Dewdas the status of protectors of Udaipur (somewhat similar to the Harawal status of Chundawats). Not only that, the Maharana rehabilitated them down-stream and bestowed them with first rights to canal irrigation for their new equivalent land grants. =New city= The Maharana encouraged people of all castes & communities to settle in the new city for which he liberally granted lands. Numerous tamra-patra (copper-plates) corroborate the bestowal of grants. The nobles and traders also settled here with the construction of their havelees, while the public constructed modest houses. Quite a few step wells were constructed as also the bathing ghats on Pichola's shoreline. Maharana Udai Singh ensured that the original dhunee (fire-pit) of the Hermit is preserved and decreed that all the subsequent coronations of Maharana are to be held at this place. The sacred place was named \\"Rai-Angan\\". The Dhunee is preserved to date with due sanctity. With the shift of seat of power from Chittaurgarh to Udaipur, the two main nobles- direct descendants of Chundaji and that of Prithviraj Chauhan too moved closer to Udaipur. The descendants of Chundaji shifted from Begu to Salumber and Rao Purbiya Balbhadra Singh (Chauhan, 1558-1583) shifted from Gungrar to Bedla respectively. A cannon was fired at chosen auspicious muhoorth (Kriti Nakshatra, Akshay Tritiya, Vaishaakh Sudi Teej, VS 1609, Saturday- 15 April 1553) at which Maharana Udai Singh laid the foundation stone for the new palace on the Rana-Magri on the eastern bank of Pichola, so did many of the citizens who were also constructing their house/havelee. It is recorded that Chauhan Balbhadra Singh also laid the foundation stone of the Bedla's \\"Gadh\\" (‡§ó‡§¢‡§º small palace, ~5 km north of Udaipur) at the same auspicious moment on hearing the sound of the cannon! =Cremation ground= A cremation ground for the public was developed for the new city on the southern bank of Ayad River at the present-day Ashoknagar Shmshaan-Ghat. A large step-well is enclosed within high walls besides the already existing Shaandeshwar Shiv. The original Pichola Lake, a lake typically seen even now in villages, behind an earthen dam, was built by nomadic baldiya/banjara traders, across the gap between the southern end of Rana Magri on which Palaces were to come up after ~200 years and the northern end of ridge on which Deendayal Park has now come up. It is believed that a wealthy and resource-rich Chittar banjara (‡§õ‡•Ä‡§§‡§∞ ‡§¨‡§Ç‡§ú‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ) constructed it in 1362 CE, possibly during a sojourn at this relaxation- inducing scenic Girwa Valley while returning to Gujarat from a business trip from the north. He utilized the services of his hundreds of small-built bullocks that carried merchandise on their backs to-&-from north India and Gujarat coasts. Pichola's ‚ÄòBadi Paal‚Äô-the masonry dam-was \\"upgraded\\" later on by Maharanas Karan Singh (1620-1628), Sangram Singh-II (1710-1734), Bhim Singh (1778-1828) and Jawan Singh (1828-1838) to provide stability as well as more water to the fast-growing city following the Mewar-Mughal treaty. Maharana Jagat Singh-I (1628-1652) further added more rooms to the Raaj-Mahal and further developed Jagmandir island palace and temples in the city. Over the centuries, four more water bodies were added to Pichola to its north, viz.-Amar Kund + Rang Sagar + Kumbhariya Talab + Swaroop Sagar (Kalaliya Shiv- Sagar). These additions resulted in diversion of Pichola's overflow from east to north through Swaroopsagar using Gumaniyawala that met Ayad River to east of present-day Zonal Railway Training Institute, near Panchavati. Fruitless attacks on Udaipur by Mughal Emperors Akbar (1576) and later on by Aurangzeb (1680) proved the location (terrain) advantage of this capital city which was defended by natural features rather than the man-made battlement! In event of attacks, the public used to move westward into the hills. Gogunda and adjoining areas provided protection from invading enemies who could not move their cavalry & artillery in such a terrain. Nor could the enemy locate and eliminate the defenders. The city-wall and moat of Udaipur were added much later‚Äìdetail at the section on Udaipur's Noteworthy Aspects: The double defense system of Udaipur. The artillery fortification of Ekling-Gadh on Machala Magra was effectively used for the defense of the city during the raid of Madhav Rao Scindia in 1769. The water in the moat (khai) used to be filled with the seepage water (jharan) from the lakes to its west. =Khargosh/hare and founding of capital cities= Robert Sewell in his 1983-page Domingos Paes Memoir-based Volume \\"A Forgotten Empire (Vijaynagar): a contribution to the History of India\\" mentions that when Krishna Devaraya (1336 CE) \\"‚Ä¶went out along the Tungabhadra River saw a hare, instead of fleeing from his hunting dogs, flew at them and bit them (p108)‚Ä¶\\" Sage Madhavacharya Vidyaranya (forest of learning) advised the chief to found a city on the spot which he did and named it \\"Vijaynagar\\". Likewise, Sultan Ahmed Shah of Gujarat founded the city of Ahmedabad on the banks of Sabarmati River in 1411CE when he saw a hare standing up to an attacking hunting dog-a land where a timid hare can boldly face a ferocious dog was surely a suitable site for a Capital and founded his new capital! Similarly, in the year 1425 CE Rao Sahasramal founded the capital town of Sirohi when during the Akshay Tritiya hunting excursion he saw a hare standing on his hind legs on a high (granite) boulder boldly fending off attacks of a falcon. In the same way Maharana Udai Singh too is said to have founded his new capital city of Udaipur when he hunted a hare at Akshay Tritiya hunt in 1553 CE in the Girwa Valley, a little northwest of Ayad town.

It is written in the Ruby programming language. Capybara can mimic actions of real users interacting with web-based applications. It can receive pages, parse the HTML and submit forms.  Background and Motivation  During the software development process (especially in the Agile and Test-driven Development environments), as the size of the tests increase, it becomes difficult to manage tests which are complex and not modular. By extending the human-readable behavior-driven development style of frameworks such as Cucumber and RSpec into the automation code itself, Capybara aims to develop simple web-based automated tests.  Anatomy of Capybara  Capybara is a Ruby library (also referred to as a gem) that is used with an underlying web-based driver. It consists of a user-friendly DSL (Domain Specific Language) which describe actions that are executed by the underlying web driver. When the page is loaded using the DSL (and underlying web driver), Capybara will attempt to locate the relevant element in the DOM (Document Object Model) and execute an action such as click button, link, etc. = Drivers = By default, Capybara uses the \`:rack_test\` driver which does not have any support for executing JavaScript. Drivers can be switched in Before and After blocks. Some of the web drivers supported by Capybara are mentioned below.  RackTest  Written in Ruby, Capybara's default driver RackTest does not require a server to be started since it directly interacts with Rack interfaces. Consequently, it can only be used for Rack applications.  Selenium  Selenium-webdriver, which is mostly used in web-based automation frameworks, is supported by Capybara. Unlike Capybara's default driver, it supports JavaScript, can access HTTP resources outside of application and can also be set up for testing in headless mode which is especially useful for CI scenarios.  Capybara-webkit  Capybara-webkit driver (a gem) is used for true headless browser testing with JavaScript support. It uses QtWebKit and it is significantly faster than Selenium as it does not load the entire browser.  Matchers  Capybara locates an element either using Domain- specific language or XPath/CSS Selectors. Partial matches can lead to unexpected results. Two or more matches can even result in a failure with an Ambiguous match error. The following are the matching strategies supported by Capybara: first: Pick the first element which matches. Not advisable to use. one: Allow only one element match. Error raised if more than one match. smart: If Capybara.exact is true, it behaves like the above option (one). If Capybara.exact is false, it will first try to find an exact match. Ambiguous exception is raised if more than one match is found. If no element is found, a new search for inexact matches is commenced. Again, an ambiguous exception is raised if more than one match is found. prefer_exact: Finds all matching (exact and which are not exact) elements. If multiple matches are found then the first exactly matching element is returned discarding other matches.  Usage  = User-Registration Process = Here is an example of how user registration test is done using Capybara. There is a test to see if the user can continue with the registration process or if there are any holds on him. If he has the requisite credentials, he will be registered and then redirected to the 'Welcome' page. describe 'UserRegistration' do it 'allows a user to register' do visit new_user_registration_path fill_in 'First name', :with => 'New' fill_in 'Last name', :with => 'User' fill_in 'Email', :with => 'newuser@example.com' fill_in 'Password', :with => 'userpassword' fill_in 'Password Confirmation', :with => 'userpassword' click_button 'Register' page.should have_content 'Welcome' end end = Capybara with Cucumber = An example of a Capybara feature used with Cucumber: When /^I want to add/ do fill_in 'a', :with => 100 fill_in 'b', :with => 100 click_button 'Add' end =Capybara with RSpec= Some minute integration is required in order to use Capybara with RSpec describe 'go to home page' do it 'opens the home page' do visit (get_homepage) expect(page).to have_content('Welcome') end end  Similar Tools  * Watir * Selenium (software) See also * Acceptance testing * Acceptance test-driven development * Behavior-driven development * Test automation * HtmlUnit * List of web testing tools * Regression testing * Given-When-Then  References  Category:Software testing tools Category:Software using the MIT license Category:Graphical user interface testing Category:Load testing tools Category:Unit testing frameworks Category:Web development software Category:Web scraping Category:Free software programmed in Ruby ","title":"Capybara (software)"},{"id":"49343804","text":"Lingkana Palace is the residence of King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck of Bhutan.

She was instrumental in forming the library's Division of Negro History, Literature and Prints, which she then headed. Personal life Latimer (center) with her parents, Henry W. and Minta B. Allen, in 1899. Catherine Bosley Allen was born in Nashville, TN, in 1896 to Minta Bosley Trotman and H. W. Allen. Although she and her family were African-American, Catherine was light-skinned and listed in the 1910 and 1930 censuses as \\"White.\\" Her family moved to Brooklyn, NY, when she was a child, and she continued to live in New York for most of her adult life. She graduated from Brooklyn's Girls High School in 1916 and went on to study librarianship at Howard University, graduating in 1918. She was a fluent French speaker and could read German. In 1921, she married Benton R. Latimer, who worked as an accountant for the United States Post Office. Librarianships After graduating from Howard University, Latimer worked for a year (1919‚Äì1920) at Tuskegee Institute's library and then returned to Brooklyn. When the New York Public Library (NYPL) hired her in 1920 as a substitute librarian, she became NYPL's first African-American librarian. She transitioned to being a full-time librarian at the end of 1920 and remained at the 135th Street branch‚Äìtermed \\"Harlem's cultural center\\"‚Äîfor the entirety of her 28-year career. In 1924, Latimer and Ernestine Rose (the branch's head librarian) started a drive to build a collection of reference books about black history. A year later, the growing collection‚Äîsupported by community leaders such as historian Arturo Alfonso Schomburg and activists James Weldon Johnson and Hubert Harrison‚Äîbecame the Division of Negro History, Literature and Prints. The object of the new division was to \\"preserve the historical records of the race... [and] to give information to everyone about the Negro.\\" Latimer was named as its head. In 1926, NYPL acquired Schomburg's own collection of printed matter, which Latimer worked on integrating into the division. She was not an expert in rare books, however, and a few years later NYPL hired Schomburg himself as curator of the Schomburg Collection, with Latimer serving as his assistant. Many authors give credit and thanks to the librarians Rose and Latimer for their work in the creation and maintenance of this division.

It is located at the end of Noss Head, a peninsula on the north-west coast of Caithness that overlooks Sinclairs Bay three miles north-east of Wick. It is notable as being the first lighthouse that was built with a diagonally paned lantern room. History The need for the lighthouse was promoted by the Northern Lights Commissioners. The light first entered service in 1849, and consists of an cylindrical tower, which is painted white. It supports a single gallery and a lantern with a black cupola. There are 76 steps to the top of the tower. Adjacent to the tower are a pair of keeper's cottages and subsidiary buildings, bounded by a walled compound. The lighthouse was built by Mr. Arnot of Inverness, with the construction being overseen by the notable lighthouse engineer Alan Stevenson (uncle of Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson), who for the first time used diagonal glass panes and framing for the exterior lantern. Considered to be both stronger, and less likely to interrupt the light from the optic, the design was employed as the standard for all future lighthouses built by the Board. As a way to provide work for those local people who had been affected by the Highland potato famine, and needed Poor Relief, labourers were hired at a rate of 3s/6d per day (¬£ as of ) to construct an access road from Wick to the lighthouse. In 1987 the light was converted to automatic operation. This same year, all of the former keepers‚Äô cottages and related structures were sold, along with the 39 acres of land upon which they were built. The sole exception being Noss Head Lighthouse Tower which, in 2018 is still owned and operated by the Northern Lighthouse Board (NLB). Between 1997 and 2014, the Clan Sinclair Trust operated the former First & Second Assistant Lighthouse Keepers' dwellings as a residential study centre for research into the clan's history. Following the owner, Mr Ian Sinclair's death 2014, the properties remained empty until 23 May 2017. On that day, the Noss Head Lighthouse compound was purchased by subscribers of an internet website operated by Unique Property Bulletin Ltd., with the express purpose of halting problematic deterioration in the empty, decaying lighthouse buildings. A major refurbishment by the new owners has been undertaken. In addition, between October 2017 and May 2018, the Northern Lighthouse Board have been effecting significant schedule of repairs, plus maintenance and repainting of the main Lighthouse Tower. Both the private owners and the NLB aim to have the entire site at Noss Head Lighthouse compound back to the top Grade A condition that the Northern Lighthouse Board set for all of their statutorily listed properties. In 2018, the Noss Head Lighthouse Principal Keeper's Cottage and Occasional Keeper's House remain as holiday accommodation. Whilst the former Engine House continues to be utilised as offices, workshop and the mess for retained lighthouse keepers employed by the Northern Lighthouse Board. Following automation, the original Fresnel lens and mechanical drive train from the lighthouse were removed and are now exhibited on two floors of the Wick Heritage Centre, one of the few lens and drive train from this period that are still in full working order. In October 2017 the main rotational light at Noss Head Lighthouse Tower was extinguished by the Northern Lighthouse Board and a new, static LED beam was installed. There is no longer a characteristic loom of the light across the sea from Noss Head following this innovation. Operational details With a focal height of 53m above sea level, the light can be seen for 25 nautical miles. Its light characteristic is made up of a flash of light every twenty seconds. The colour being white or red, varying with direction. The light and tower is maintained by the Northern Lighthouse Board, and is registered under the international Admiralty number A3544 and has the NGA identifier of 114-3012. Listed buildings The Lighthouse Tower, former First Assistant and Second Assistant Keeper's Cottages, along with the Stable Block are protected as a category A listed building, and considered to be of national or international importance. The original 1849 built Principal Keeper's Cottage and Occasional Keeper's House were demolished in the 1960s and a modern detached rectangular single storey newbuild replaced these to the west of the main lighthouse tower. The 1960s built structures are not listed, although they are within the environs of the category A listed properties and as such require appropriate protocols to be observed in relation to their maintenance and upkeep.
