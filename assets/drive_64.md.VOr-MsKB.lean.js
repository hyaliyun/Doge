Member of the National Agreement for Change. It arose after the CNE removed the Democratic People's Movement from its legal status after declaring the existence of poor electoral results on the part of this party, which I consider illegal its dissolution. The members of the previous party formed Unidad Popular to replace the old MPD, in which they would continue their political work.Unidad Popular - Principios Consultada el 3 de enero del 2015 \\"Surgimos de la trayectoria revolucionaria del Movimiento Popular Democr√°tico MPD, somos el legado hist√≥rico de JAIME HURTADO, representamos la continuaci√≥n de su lucha.\\" The party has a special stronghold in the province of Esmeraldas, where they currently hold the provincial government.  Ideology  left Its ideological principles are under a revolutionary and socialist character, considering the continuation of the struggle of the Democratic People's Movement and Jaime Hurtado. They oppose individualism and the relationship between countries based on imperialism, a system opposed by internationalism among the peoples they support. They support the development of participatory democracy and the right to self- determination of peoples, supporting, like Pachakutik , the constitution of Ecuador as a plurinational and multicultural state. They also declare themselves environmentalists. Within the movement are integrated different thoughts of the revolutionary left, taking the importance of the Marxism- Leninism of PCMLE , which is why it is defined as the electoral front of this organization.  History  = Background = The Democratic People's Movement was an organization founded by the militants of PCMLE , among them Jaime Hurtado, as well as other sectors of the left on March 17, 1978 at the premises of the Unique Trade Union of Drivers of Pichincha. The principles of this organization were summarized in its slogan: the \\"conquest of a popular, patriotic, democratic and revolutionary government that resolutely applies its program and lays the foundations for the conquest of socialism\\". The MPD would be opposition of all governments since its founding, from Jaime Rold√≥s to Gustavo Noboa, being present in the organization of strikes, which led to their obtaining the qualification of \\"tirapiedras\\" that in English means: stone shooter. In the case of Lucio Guti√©rrez they maintained their support until 3 months after their promotion to the presidency. Later they would continue in opposition to Alfredo Palacio. During the government of Rafael Correa was at the beginning in an alliance with this regime, but in 2009 the critical position of the party before the policies of Alianza Pa√≠s led to the break. Since then, the MPD was strongly opposed to Correa's government considering him a \\"traitor of the left\\" while losing political space, which caused low results that finally led to the dissolution of the MPD in the National Electoral Council. However, the party considered it as a tactic to end the political work of the organization.

Ukraine is in a constituency with Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Georgia, Israel, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, and the executive director of the constituency is Frank Heemskerk from the Netherlands.  Ukraine Economy  Dating back to its constituency in the Soviet Union, the Ukraine served as a crucial economic component in its membership, providing more than one-fourth of the agricultural output for the Soviet Union. Since their independence in 1991, the Ukraine began implementing reforms which liberalized prices and established a framework for widespread privatization. However, in part owing to controversy regarding the implementation of these reforms, the country has experienced critical decline in its economic stability at numerous intervals, noting a 40% decline in economic output in 1999, compared to prior output in 1991. In 2009, the country experienced a 15% economic contraction, adding onto a plethora of additional economic challenges, including zero GDP growth in 2013, and an economic shrink of 6.8% in 2014. As of now, the Ukrainian government has said it needs,needs $35bn (¬£21bn) to pay its bills over the next two years. At the urgency of outside institutions, such as the World Bank and the IMF, Ukraine has begun to implement particular economic reforms, in the hopes of producing more buoyant economic activity.  History  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine obtains its independence in 1991, and in September 3, 1992, Ukraine joins the World Bank. Ukraine's aspirations to social and economic reforms, with help from the World Bank, were always delayed due to difficulties in implementation of reforms because of corruption and poor governance. The lack of capacity to decently implement policies due to corruption made it difficult for the World Bank to initially begin projects in Ukraine.  Ukrainian Crisis  In addition to constant economic unrest, the Ukraine underwent a revolution, which resulted in the ousting of Victor Yanukovych, the then- president of the country. Furthermore, the nation experienced further economic turmoil and crises as a result of the ensuing annexation of Crimea by Russia. In total, military conflict, as well as outside external economic factors contributed to an approximate 17% GDP decline, inflation at 60%, and a depletion of foreign reserves. Furthermore, considering the loss of Ukraine's industry in Donbass as a result of the aggression, the Ukraine experienced an economic contraction of 6.6% in 2014 and by 9.8% in 2015.  World Bank in Ukraine  = Plans and Agreements = Ukraine first joined the World Bank in 1992 and currently holds 0.77% of equities as a member in the World Bank. In total, the Ukraine has received approximately $7.4 from 50 loans from the World Bank, totaling an allocation of $10.1 billion. Furthermore, the World Bank also decided to provide additional assistance to Ukraine, totaling in the amount of $3 billion in March 2014. Currently, the World Bank and Ukraine, together, are realizing a total of 12 projects, aimed to improve infrastructure, road and traffic safety, power transmission, urban infrastructure development, and energy efficiency. Specifically, there are currently eight IBRD investments in place in the Ukraine. The World Bank has placed particular attention to promote programs related to good governance and transparency in the Ukraine, as well as accountability in the public sector, and stability in the banking sector. Furthermore, the World Bank aims to reduce the cost of doing business, as well as promote more efficient methods of using public resources to provide critical public services. Current projects in Ukraine have also provided a focus on improving basic public services, which include water and sanitation, health, and social protection. In addition, the World Bank continues to promote the development of public infrastructure such as the power transmission networks and roads. The implementation of these institutional and structural reforms aim to provide impacting economic development of Ukraine. = Country Partnership Framework = The Country Partnership Framework for Ukraine aligns the goals necessary for the country's economic development. The development strategy includes goals aiming to provide fiscal consolidation, a moving flexible exchange rate, reforming energy tariffs, as well as enhancing transparency of public procurement. in 2014, the World Bank aligned $5.5 billion in two series development policy loans, with seven new investment options aimed to bolster the private sector. The World Bank has also provided support for four budget support operations, (MSDPL-1, MSDPL-2, FSDP -1, FSDPL-2), aimed at good governance, accountability in the public sector, stability in the banking sector, reduction in the cost of doing business, and the provision of an efficient use of scarce public resources. = Effects = The World Bank's programs have had a notable impact on the economic status of Ukraine. Economic growth picked up to 3.4% in the first half of 2018, as well as positive growth in domestic trade, at about 5.8%. However, growth in manufacturing slowed by 3%, pointing to weaknesses in investor confidence. Household consumption continued to grow rapidly by 5.6% in the first quarter due to higher pensions and wages. The fiscal deficit remained on target at 2.3% of GDP in 2017, however, despite, the on-target fiscal deficit, expenditures were up by 11.7%. The World Bank has noted a higher spending on social programs reaching a total 5.7% of the total GDP. In addition, poverty remains at above pre-crisis levels in 2017. Additionally, unemployment remains at 9.7% from 10.1% in 2017. = Water = World Bank Intervention in Ukraine has long been aimed at the development of Ukraine's infrastructure. Since late 2014 the World Bank has begun multiple projects in Ukraine aimed at improving roads, highways, municipal structures, waste management, and ultimately allowing Ukrainian markets to open up abroad. The cities of Ukraine all face problems with decades-old irrigation system that was inefficient in its use of energy as well as problematic in its dealing with waste. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) gave Ukraine a $140 million loan, provided in order to assist Ukraine to deal with the decaying pipeline, by replacing the older pumps with new systems that are more efficient in the movement of water and waste. The city of Kolomyia managed to install eight kilometers of new technologically advanced water pipes and sewage disinfection system, and is now the first city in Ukraine to keep the water clean without the use of chlorine. In addition to developing new pipeline the World Bank has also loaned $22.8 million for improvement of water pumps that will allow utility companies access to newer more efficient pumps which allow for deeper drilling for purer water. = Road = Ukraine has many mountain roads, and as such tends to have many car accidents due to most drivers not being aware of how to drive on Ukraine's long mountain roads. Ukraine makes a great deal of capital from tourists who come to see the natural scenery from the mountains of Ukraine. The World Bank has begun projects to improve the safety of these mountain roads that are the location of many accidents. Ukraine has recently managed to widen roads, and install emergency sidetracks on the mountain highways, as well as increases warning signs to signal drivers to drive more cautiously along the mountains. According to the World Bank, the improvements of the roads of Ukraine will not only diminish the number of accidents, but also allow for easier transportation of goods throughout the country allowing the Ukrainian economy to grow. There has been a great deal of demand for the improvement of roads from private businesses to allow for the transportation of goods, the World Bank's involvement in safety improvement has also been an answer to the demands of many private businesses, particularity farmers who previously were limited in their capacity to transport goods. The growth of roads allows for an increase of trade within Ukraine, and opens doors to exporters to gain access to trade abroad as well. World Bank analysis indicated that the improvement of roads allows for the economic development within Ukraine, however, in order to further stimulate growth, the World Bank has worked directly with Ukrainian banks in order to provide long-term loans that will allow companies in Ukraine to begin exporting abroad. The World Bank has invested in Ukrainian exporters via the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to work with Ukreximbank, which is the trade bank of Ukraine in order to help Ukrainian exporters recover from the recession. The growth of the economy and benefits to exporters gave the World Bank incentive to further improve transport connectivity, road safety, and improve road network management in Ukraine, in order to allow for the growth of exporters throughout the country. However, the conflict in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine has resulted in the prevention of the completion of this project, as well as changes in planning = Predictions = Currently, the World Bank predicts additional turbulence in emerging markets, and instability owing to influence brought about by political disagreements within the country regarding the implementation of reforms. In order to meet a projected growth of 3.3% in 2018 and 3.5.% in 2019, Ukraine needs to meet agreements and requirements from international organizations such as the World Bank and the IMF. However, Ukraine faces major financing needs in the coming years, that requires the mobilization of sizable international financing in order to meet the fiscal deficit target of 2.5% of GDP. By contrast, if Ukraine does not reform, predictions point to macroeconomic vulnerabilities intensifying, as well as financing difficulties forcing a compression in domestic demand.

Its primary purpose is to increase financial stability in member countries, with financial means ranging from loans to credit offers. Uruguay is a country in South America. It is a member of the IMF. The economy of Uruguay is diverse, with 7.5% of Gross domestic product (GDP) originating from agriculture, 10% from tourism and 20.6% from industry. As of 2017, Uruguay had the ninth largest GDP in South America and the 96th globally.  Assistance  Uruguay is a beneficiary of IMF intervention, although it has not undergone any of the substantial macroeconomic changes mandated by the IMF and no projects have been completed there. However, multiple arrangements have been made for the IMF to provide the country with standby credit (funds to be used as a last resort in the event of due payment to a third party), the first of which was arranged in 1996. This is in line with the institution's goal of achieving and supporting economic stability. These standby credit lines started during a time of significant economic growth (5% year-over-year), but also at a time of heavy dollarization (alignment with/dependency on the U.S. Dollar). For context, as of 2008, 60% of Uruguay's bank loans use U.S. Dollars as opposed to the national currency, the Uruguayan peso. In general, these stand-by arrangements have been available for terms of one to two years, each valued in the range of 150 - 2000 SDR (108 million - US$1.5 billion). Additionally, the Uruguayan government has utilized 72% of funds made available to them between 2000 and 2006, the last arrangement expiring in December 2006. As of May 2017, the Uruguayan government owes 380,000 SDR (US$274,502.88) to the IMF, which represents less than 0.00001% of the GDP, standing at US$53.44 billion as of June 2017.  Usage and effects  In concert with these stand-by arrangements, the Uruguayan government has been relatively successful in its implementation of a ‚Äúgradual anti-inflation strategy‚Äù started in the 1990s. Inflation has slowed to 9% in 2017, versus a peak of 140%. However, it is greater than the government's goal of 6%. In addition, Uruguay maintains a high degree of liquidity (the ability to turn its assets into cash). The IMF speculated that an economic downturn in neighbouring countries Argentina and Brazil, as well as a slowdown in China, are contributing factors to Uruguay's slowed economic growth. Despite this, Uruguay's heavy utilization of IMF credit has been heavily correlated with its lasting stability in the South American region. Additionally, Uruguay has been able to keep pace with, or in some cases outperform, the GDP growth rate of neighbouring countries: Brazil and Argentina.

From the 11th century onward the Genoese navy protected the interests of the republic and projected its power throughout the Mediterranean Sea. The navy declined in power after the 16th century, periodically coming under the control of foreign powers, and was finally disbanded following the annexation of Genoa by the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont in 1815.  History  The Genoese fleet returning to port after a successful expedition against the Ottoman Turks. Depicted in the 1597 painting View of Genoa. = Establishment = A center of trade since antiquity, the city of Genoa relied heavily on income from merchant shipping and trade. As such, piracy posed a substantial threat to the city's merchants, who were forced to pay for the defense of their ships. The city was likewise vulnerable to attack, a fact made apparent when in 935 a fleet led by Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Tamimi of the Fatimids sacked the city.Lev, Yaacov (1984). \\"The Fatimid Navy, Byzantium and the Mediterranean Sea, 909‚Äì1036 CE/297‚Äì427 AH\\". Byzantion. 54: 220‚Äì252. OCLC 1188035. pg. 232 The Muslim incursion spurred the city to build strong harbor defenses, and renewed interest in an armed merchant marine to patrol the Ligurian Sea. In 1005 the Republic of Genoa was established; The new government was headed by a consul who would be elected every few years by the wealthiest merchants and landowners in the city. The young republic was as such dominated by the needs and desires of the merchant houses, and the navy was given a place of high importance in the new thalassocracy. A High Admiral was appointed, and with the government coordinating the navy, Genoese traders and merchants came to dominate the Ligurian Sea in the 11th century. The city-state was considered one of the four Repubbliche Marinare in Italy alongside Venice, Pisa, and Amalfi. However, the early fleet was composed of ships levied from private merchants, fishermen, and lacked dedicated warships. As such, the 11th century fleet was relegated to protecting the trade of the great merchant houses of Genoa, which continued to dominate the politics and economy of the republic. In an effort to suppress piracy, the fleet was occasionally deployed to fight against Muslim corsairs from Aghlabid in North Africa.H. E. J. Cowdrey (1977), \\"The Mahdia campaign of 1087\\" The English Historical Review 92, pp. 1‚Äì29. After decades of disorder caused by the Norman conquest of southern Italy, the Genoese navy assisted in the capture of the city of Mahdia in 1087.Erdmann, Carl. The Origin of the Idea of Crusade, tr. Marshall W. Baldwin and Walter Goffart. Princeton University Press, 1977.Cowdrey, H. E. J. \\"The Mahdia Campaign of 1087.\\" The English Historical Review, 92:362 (January, 1977), 1‚Äì29. The beginning of the Crusades in 1095 resulted in a great period of prosperity for Genoa. As new crusaders were constantly needed to secure the Holy Land (and later to reinforce the Crusader states), Genoa was able to profit by assisting in the transport of military forces from Europe.Housley 2006, pp. 152‚Äì154 To better support the crusaders, a squadron of 12 Genoese galleys were deployed to the Holy Land during the First Crusade. The ships served to counter the threat posed by the Fatimid navy and saw some successes, with the fleet succeeding in trapping a Fatimid fleet in Beirut Harbor during the First Crusade. The Genoese Embriaco family became famous for their exploits in the Holy Land during this time, most notably for their leading of a Genoese seaborne attack during the Siege of Tripoli. In addition to receiving large amounts of loot from crusader commanders, the republic established a number of Genoese trading colonies in the Mediterranean and Black Seas during the Crusades. The Lebanese town of Byblos came completely under Genoese control, and the republic was entitled to 1/3 of the crusader- controlled city of Acre's income. The Genoese fleet sheltered in these ports and defended them from pirates. In the early 12th century the Genoese navy participated in the Pisan-led 1113‚Äì15 Balearic Islands expedition to suppress Majorcan piracy. At this time the fleet relied principally on two types of galleys, heavy Byzantine-style dromon (dromone), and lighter Italian-style galleys. This fleet was supplemented by armed merchant cogs. = Mercantile conflicts = The Battle of Meloria (1284) established Genoese naval domination in the Western Mediterranean for nearly a century. In addition to supporting the wars in the Holy Land, the navy played a vital role in the Genoese rivalry with the nearby Republic of Pisa, which competed with Genoa for influence in Corsica and Sardinia. It was common for the Italian maritime states to prey on their rival's merchant shipping, and the Genoese navy was known to both suppress and participate in this practice. In 1119 a Genoese squadron raided a Pisan merchant convoy, beginning the first of the Genoese- Pisan Wars. The first of the wars ended inconclusively, but resulted in a century of raiding and piracy as both cities fought over Corsica and Sardinia. In the 1230s a second, undeclared war erupted between Genoa and Pisa as part of the wider Guelphs-Ghibellines Conflict. The Holy Roman Emperor sided with Pisa when the war broke out, forcing Genoa to find allies abroad. The republic sided with the Pope (who was at the time in a dispute with the Holy Roman Emperor), and sent a fleet to transport a Guelph army to Rome in a show of support for the papal cause. The Ghibellines discovered the plan and, along with a Pisan fleet, intercepted the Genoese navy at the Battle of Giglio in 1241. Weighted down with passengers and baggage, the Genoese navy lost 3 galleys sunk and 27 captured.Milman, Henry (1857). History of Latin Christianity Vol.IV. London. The second war with Pisa ended in a white peace in 1243. In the eastern Mediterranean, conflicts between Genoese and Venetian merchants in Acre resulted in the War of Saint Sabas being fought from 1256 to 1270.Lane (1973), p. 73-78 During the conflict the Genoese navy was defeated in a series of pitched battles against Venice, and so it resorted to attacking merchant convoys instead of warships. The disastrous defeats at the hands of Pisa and Venice hindered Genoese ambitions, but also led to the creation of a dedicated naval force in Genoa. Larger galleys were built, the office of High Admiral was granted more powers, and the formidable Genoese crossbowmen were added to the crews of Genoese warships. When a third war broke out between Pisa and Genoa, the rebuilt Genoese fleet won a major victory at the 1284 Battle of Meloria, in which the Genoese captured 37 Pisan galleys and 9000 sailors. The battle left Genoa the strongest naval power in the Western Mediterranean. white and red cross of Genoa. With Pisa in a state of decline, Genoa expanded into Corsica and northern Sardinia. In 1266 Genoese merchants purchased the city of Kaffa from the Golden Horde and went on to establish further trading colonies in the Black Sea and Byzantine Empire. This expansion brought Genoa into further conflict with the powerful city-state of Venice, which also had trade relations in the area. The bitter rivalry escalated into the first of the Venetian‚ÄìGenoese wars in 1296, at which point Genoa's fleet consisted of 125 galleys. Despite outnumbering the Venetian navy, the Genoese fleet was unable to catch them, and Genoa's merchants suffered greatly during the war. A change came in 1298 when a major engagement was fought in the Adriatic Sea off the coast of Korƒçula. At the Battle of Curzola, a fleet of 75 Genoese galleys decisively defeated a force of 95 Venetian galleys, destroying or capturing 83 of the enemy ships. However, Genoese casualties were heavy and the city's shipyards were unable to quickly replace the ships lost at Curzola. The conflict ended in a relative stalemate in 1299. Following the war, Genoa dominated the Mediterranean slave trade and the Genoese navy employed thousands of galley slaves as oarsmen. This new policy decreased the cost of maintaining the navy, as rowers no longer had to be paid (as opposed to Venice, which only employed paid rowers), but also decreased the number of men available for boarding parties, as Genoese captains did not trust armed slaves.William Ledyard Rodgers (1967).

The Oxford Encyclopedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology: Volume 3. Oxford University Press. p. 16. . As Genoa continued to expand its trade network during the 14th century, the navy was increasingly employed to defend trade routes. While these naval trade routes greatly benefited the city, they also left it vulnerable to disease. In 1347 the Black Death was introduced to Kaffa during a Mongol siege and soon spread aboard fleeing Genoese ships.\\"Channel 4 ‚Äì History ‚Äì The Black Death\\". Channel 4. Archived from the original on 25 June 2008. Retrieved 3 November 2008. A Genoese merchant fleet sailing from Kaffa spread the disease to Messina, from which city the plague spread to the rest of Europe.\\"At the beginning of October, in the year of the incarnation of the Son of God 1347, twelve Genoese galleys were fleeing from the vengeance which our Lord was taking on account of their nefarious deeds and entered the harbour of Messina. In their bones they bore so virulent a disease that anyone who only spoke to them was seized by a mortal illness and in no manner could evade death. ...Not only all those who had speech with them died, but also those who had touched or used any of their things. When the inhabitants of Messina discovered that this sudden death emanated from the Genoese ships they hurriedly ordered them out of the harbor and town. But the evil remained and caused a fearful outbreak of death.\\" Michael Platiensis (1357), quoted in Johannes Nohl (1926). The Black Death, trans. C.H. Clarke. London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd., pp. 18‚Äì20. Over 40,000 people in the city of Genoa died in the pandemic, a disaster that reduced the amount of money available to finance the fleet. Many sailors were also killed by the Black Death, leaving the navy undermanned.Michael of Piazza (Platiensis) Bibliotheca scriptorum qui res in Sicilia gestas retulere Vol 1, p. 562, cited in Ziegler, 1998, p. 40. straits of Messina. A third conflict with Venice began over trading disputes in the Black Sea in 1350. Venice allied itself with the Kingdom of Aragon and the Byzantine Empire, and in doing so mustered a large force that outnumbered the Genoese navy. Genoa won a costly victory at a battle in the Bosporus Straits in February 1352 that forced Byzantium to withdraw from the war. The tide of the war reversed when in 1353 the Genoese navy suffered a defeat at the Battle of Alghero. The loss of a fleet at Alghero sparked civil unrest in Genoa, further hampering the Republic's war effort. To combat this discord, the republic was temporarily dissolved and Genoa came under the rule of the Duke of Milan. In November 1354 a Genoese fleet commanded by Admiral Paganino Doria surprised a Venetian fleet off the coast of Pylos. At the ensuing Battle of Sapienza Genoa sank or captured 35 Venetian galleys. A peace treaty was signed between Venice and Milan in 1355, bringing an end to the conflict. While the status quo in the east was maintained, the Kingdom of Aragon was able to establish itself as a major rival to Genoese domination of the Western Mediterranean. Genoa broke free from Milanese control following the conclusion of the war, and the republic was reestablished. In 1378 the War of Chioggia broke out between Genoa and Venice, a conflict Genoa initiated to counter Venetian threats to the Republic's trade routes in the Black Sea. During the war, a large percentage of the navy was relegated to escorting transport ships from Genoa to Crimea. The Venetians took advantage of the absence of Genoese warships and raided coastal settlements under Genoese control. The Genoese navy suffered a defeat in 1378 when a squadron was destroyed by the Venetians off of the Cape d'Anzio. Genoa won a victory in May 1379, after which the fleet sailed to the port of Chioggia in the Adriatic and captured the city. The Genoese intended to use their new position at Chioggia to blockade the city of Venice, but on June 24, 1380 the navy was defeated and driven from the city by a Venetian relief force. 17 Genoese warships were captured in the ensuing rout, and the Genoese army was left stranded in Chioggia without supplies.Sanderson, Michael W. B. Sea Battles: a Reference Guide. 1st American ed. Middletown, Conn., Wesleyan University Press, 1975, p. 51. The Genoese garrison later surrendered the town, and the War of Chioggia soon ended in a status quo, having exhausted both Genoa and Venice. The Genoese navy lost vital sailors, ships, and was supplanted as the leading naval power in the Western Mediterranean by Aragon. = Decline = The costly wars against Venice and the devastating impact of the Black Death greatly reduced the Genoese navy's strength. The rise of larger nation states also sapped the ability of the relatively small city- state to compete militarily. Genoa (with French support) launched a crusade against Tunisia in 1390, with the intent to protect Genoese trade colonies from Muslim pirates. During the war the Genoese navy provided ships while French knights laid siege to the fortress of Mahdi. The war was a success for the christian forces, but also resulted in the French gaining political influence in Genoa, which was pressured to declare itself a French fiefdom in 1396. The Genoese navy was brought under French control, and on 7 October 1403 was decisively defeated by Venice at the Battle of Modon after the Genoese fleet raided Venetian trade colonies. The Republic gained independence from France in 1409, but the prestige of the military had been severely damaged and the city remained a coveted political conquest for both France and Aragon.von Meerheimb, Richard (1865). Von Palermo bis Ga√´ta. Dresden. In 1435 a Genoese fleet was dispatched at the request of Milan to the town of Gaeta, which was besieged by Aragon. At the time, the Duke of Milan and the King of Aragon were fighting as to who would control the Kingdom of Sicily. The Genoese fleet arrived at Gaeta and defeated the numerically superior Aragonese fleet at the Battle of Ponza. The Aragonese flagship was forced to surrender and King Alfonso V of Aragon was captured. Despite this setback, Aragon prevailed in the conflict and Sicily came under Aragonese control, making passage through the Strait of Messina difficult and further disrupting Genoese naval activities.Simonde de Sismondi, Jean-Charles-L√©onard (1832). A History of the Italian Republics. Philadelphia. A map of the world in 1544 created by Genoese cartographer Battista Agnese. Starting in the 15th century the Ottoman Empire began to expand at the expense of the Byzantine Empire and other countries friendly to Genoese merchants. The gradual loss of Imperial territory, coupled with the destruction of smaller Christian states such as Trebizond, Cyprus, and Amasra chipped away at Genoese mercantile interests in the Black Sea. The Ottomans constructed a massive fleet, and in doing so became the dominant naval power in the Eastern Mediterranean.Ottoman Warfare 1500-1700, Rhoads Murphey, 1999, p.23 In 1453 Constantinople fell, and the Ottomans closed the Dardanelles and Hellespont to Christian shipping. This act cut the Genoese navy off from its bases in the Black Sea, and Genoa found itself isolated from the colonies that had for centuries provided the republic access to Russia and Central Asia.Ossian De Negri, Teofilo. Storia di Genova. With no way to return home and having had their lines of communication disrupted, the Genoese squadron in the Black Sea dispersed. Now indefensible, warehouses, fortresses, and ships built by the republic were lost. The former Genoese colonies were eventual annexed by regional powers, with Kaffa falling to the Ottomans in 1475.The unknown holocaust of the Crimean Italians (in Italian) (in Russian) (in Ukrainian) Despite the decline of the Genoese Navy and the Republic, Genoa's sailors remained in high regard. Cartographers and navigators such as Christopher Columbus, Battista Agnese, and Pietro Vesconte all hailed from the city state.  Resurgence under Andrea Doria  Portrait of Admiral Andrea Doria, who advocated for a strong Genoese navy in the 16th century. The Genoese navy saw a period of revival under the leadership of admiral and statesman Andrea Doria, who renewed interest in the navy. Doria was born in Genoa and served as a mercenary for various nations during his early life. He returned from service as a mercenary captain in 1503 to encourage Genoa to resist French encroachment, but failed and was forced to flee the city. From 1503 to 1522 Doria commanded a Genoese squadron in the Mediterranean against the Ottomans and the Barbary states. He fought against the Holy Roman Empire on behalf of France in 1522 before leading the Genoese fleet into Genoa and expelling the French in 1528. Doria then came into the service of Emperor Charles V of Spain and the Holy Roman Empire and was granted the office of Imperial Admiral. Doria incorporated the Genoese navy into the Imperial navy and went on to defend the fortress of Koroni from the Ottomans and capture the city of Patras. A major victory over the Ottomans in the Battle of Girolata by the Genoese navy resulted in the capture of 11 galleys and Admiral Dragut. After retiring from military service, Doria worked to establish the Republic of Genoa as an autonomous state within the Holy Roman Empire, and in doing so gained the protection of the Emperor's army in return for providing the naval expertise of the Genoese. The Genoese economy began to shift from trade to banking and manufacturing as Portugal and Spain established their overseas empires, and Doria advocated that the Genoese navy should shift its doctrine from competition with other Christian nations to that of cooperation with other europeans against Muslim piracy. He was also a strong proponent of using naval artillery, and as such equipped many of the navy's vessels with cannon.Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy. Informational panel titled \\"Firearms\\" The revival period ended in the mid-16th century due to a series of military failures. The Imperial fleet was decisively defeated by the Ottomans at the Battle of Preveza in 1538, a Genoese fleet was damaged by a series of storms during the 1541 Algiers expedition, a Genoese-Spanish fleet was defeated at Ponza in 1552, and the navy failed to stop a French force from capturing Corsica in 1553. Genoa sent a contingent of her fleet to a christian alliance that was defeated by the Ottomans at the Battle of Djerba in 1560. However, in 1571 the Genoese navy contributed 29 galleys (53 ships in total) to the Holy League fleet at the pivotal Battle of Lepanto, during which the Genoese admiral Giovanni Andrea Doria smashed the right flank of the Ottoman fleet. The decisive Christian victory ended Ottoman domination of the Mediterranean., p. 70 1556 saw the republic create the Magistrato delle galee (magistrate of the galleys) to combat small-scale piracy. During the 15th century competition between Genoa, Venice, Spain, and Portugal resulted in the creation of the Carrack. Genoa built a number of carracks during the 16th century and incorporated them into the navy.Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy. Informational panel titled \\"From galleons to vessels\\" Coat of arms of the modern Italian Navy, the Marina Militare, which incorporates the Genoese flag (seen on the top right) = Further decline and disbandment = The decline of the Genoese navy and fleet continued through the 17th and 18th centuries. Changes in the economy of Genoa ensured that bankers, not merchants, became the strongest economic force in the city. The need to protect trade routes declined as a consequence, shrinking the need for a large navy. At the start of the Thirty Years' War the Genoese navy consisted of only 10 galleys. Genoa allied itself with Spain during the war, leading to France laying siege to the city in 1625. Spain launched an expedition to relieve Genoa, known as the Relief of Genoa. In 1684 the French navy bombarded the city, an act that devastated parts of Genoa and razed the Republic's shipyards.Genoa 1684, World History at KMLA In the postwar period the republic commissioned a number of frigates and corvettes into the navy, though funding for the force was minimal. In 1742 the last possession of the Genoese in the Mediterranean, the island fortress of Tabarka, was lost to Tunis.Alberti Russell, Janice. The Italian community in Tunisia, 1861‚Äì1961: a viable minority. pag. 142.  Napoleonic Wars  Following the rise of first Revolutionary France and later Napoleonic France, the Genoese Republic's political situation became increasingly untenable. While officially neutral during the French Revolutionary Wars, Genoa's close proximity to France allowed the larger country to continuously pressure the republic. During the 1795 Battle of Genoa, a French fleet with Genoese support was defeated by the British Royal Navy off the coast of the city. This resulted in the Royal Navy establishing a years-long blockade of Genoa that significantly affected the republic's economy. In 1797 the republic was dissolved and the city of Genoa itself was occupied by a French army. The lands that had formerly been under the control of the city of Genoa were reconstituted into the Ligurian Republic, a French client state. However, the Genoese navy remained intact. In 1798 the Ligurian fleet dispatched some of its ships to aid Napoleon Bonaparte's campaign in Egypt and Syria; this ended in disaster when the French fleet was scattered or destroyed at the Battle of the Nile. In 1804, newly-crowned Emperor Napoleon sought to appropriate the remnants of the Genoese navy and Genoa's shipyards for use against Great Britain, and so the city agreed to begin constructing 10 ships of the line (one of which, the Brillant, would be captured while under construction and commissioned into the Royal Navy) and 10 frigates for the French Navy. In exchange for this service, Genoese officers and sailors were allowed to hold positions on French ships. In addition, all ships of the Ligurian Republic would be allowed to sail under the French flag. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the city was granted to the Kingdom of Sardinia. The Genoese navy was disbanded on 3 January 1815, the day the city was annexed.Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy.

Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1956. p. 753  Organization  The Genoese navy was divided between a public fleet and a private fleet. The public fleet was directly funded by the city's government, and its ships were built at the expense of the state. These ships were used in major battles and to defend the harbor of Genoa itself. The private fleet was much larger than the public fleet, and was made up from ships belonging to the various merchant families that dominated Genoese politics. Both fleets were under the command of the office of the High Admiral, who was appointed by the ruler (either the doge, council, or duke depending on the era) of Genoa.Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy. Informational panel titled \\"Crisis of the Republic, crisis of the marine\\"  Equipment  The port and fleet of Genoa in the early 14th century, by Quinto Cenni = Ships = The galley was the primary ship used by the Genoese Navy. These ships possessed an advantage in terms of maneuverability when compared to purely sailing vessels, and their design allowed them to be produced relatively quickly. Genoese galleys were lighter and longer (45 meters long as opposed to the Mediterranean standard of 40-42 meters) than contemporary Venetian and Ottoman galleys, though this speed came at the cost of durability and maneuverability.Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy. Informational panel titled \\"Genoese galleys\\" Genoese galleys were also noted to have larger holds than the galleys of other naval powers; this extra space allowed Genoese galleys to carry more provisions, cargo, or soldiers. Genoa fielded two types of galleys; smaller and faster ones that were used to protect trade in times of peace, and heavier dromon-style galleys built for battle and garrison duty. The lighter galleys (many of which were classified as galiots) were more numerous, while the heavy galleys were usually only put to sea (or constructed, if the fleet was undersized) during times of war.Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy. Informational panel titled \\"The Arsenal of Genoa\\" The fleet also made extensive use of Brigantines and Feluccas, small sailing ships which acted as scouts and raiders when the republic's galleys were unable to operate effectively.Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy. Informational panel titled \\"Long ships, round ships\\" In addition to galleys and light sailing ships, Genoa refitted merchant ships for combat roles during wartime. As naval technology progressed, the navy began to incorporate galleons and man-o-war into the fleet, though never on the same scale as the galley. = Sailors = Genoese sailors were recruited from the city's populace or from the colonies. Many only served part time in the military, instead being professional merchant sailors, fishermen, or mercenaries. The republic also crewed many of its galleys with criminals, prisoners of war, and slaves. Conditions for sailors (both free and enslaved) were challenging, with disease being a constant issue. The navy encouraged captains to keep their crew alive by issuing heavy fines to those who lost too many men. The republic mandated that every galley in service be crewed with a barber - who also served as a surgeon - in order to maintain a standard of hygiene aboard the ship.Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy. Informational panel titled \\"Convicts; better alive than dead\\" Looking to provide its sailors with durable clothing that could be worn wet or dry, the navy began in the 15th century to equip sailors with Genoese- produced denim jeans, and in doing so became one of the driving forces behind the adoption of the clothing. Genoese sailors and marines were armed with boarding swords and bucklers or with crossbows and muskets. In the 16th century the Genoese marines were protected by iron or steel Cuirasses and wore Morions. = Facilities = The Genoese government maintained special facilities on the city's waterfront (collectively known as the Genoese Arsenal) where the republic's galleys were built, berthed, and maintained.  Legacy  The flags of the great Italian naval powers are incorporated into the ensign of the modern day Italian Navy. The cities represented include Genoa, Venice, Pisa, and Amalfi. The Genoese Navy's shore facilities left a major mark on the waterfront of modern-day Genoa. The Genoese Arsenal's extensive facilities were converted from military to civilian use following the Unification of Italy, leading to the port becoming a driving factor in Genoa's economic revival. These facilities were badly damaged by a British attack during World War II, after which the area was renovated; the Genoese ship building industry was moved out of the old harbor of the city, while the grounds of the former arsenal were converted into piers for docking ships and Genoa's cruise ship terminal. The oldest part of the arsenal became the foundation for the Galata - Museo del mare, a museum dedicated to the naval history of Genoa.Information from a display at the Galata Museo del Mare in Genoa, Italy.

As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. In this species the flower is green, white and brown with an inflated base, a narrow hood and the longest labellum of any Western Australian Pterostylis species. Description Pterostylis angusta is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of dark bluish-green leaves lying flat on the ground. Each leaf is long and wide. Flowering plants usually only have a single flower long and wide which leans slightly forwards on a flowering stem high with between three and seven stem leaves. The flowers are green and white, brownish near the tip. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The base of the galea is inflated and the top is narrow with a sharply-pointed end. The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea and have narrow tips long and a V-shaped sinus between their bases. The labellum is long, about wide and curved, and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs from late May to July. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis angusta was first formally described in 1971 by Alex George from a specimen collected near Mount Trio in the Stirling Range and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (angusta) is a Latin word meaning \\"narrow\\", referring to the narrow galea. Distribution and habitat The narrow shell orchid grows in two disjunct areas in the Jarrah Forest biogeographic region, one between Brookton and the Stirling Range and the other between Australind and Capel. It mostly grows in woodland, often in sandy soil. Conservation Pterostylis angusta is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Fairfax was also a staffer for Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, in the senator's Washington office. After serving on the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee for two years, Fairfax received a J.D. degree from Columbia Law School, where he was a member of the Columbia Law Review. Over the summer of 2004, he joined the John Kerry presidential campaign, as a body man for John Edwards. He then served as law clerk to Judge Gerald Bruce Lee of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in 2005. He worked in the Washington office of the law firm WilmerHale before joining the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia in 2010. Fairfax worked for two years as a federal prosecutor in Alexandria, Virginia. He served as deputy coordinator of the Northern Virginia Human Trafficking Task Force during this time.Scott Shenk, Vogel, Fairfax in tight race for lieutenant governor, Free Lance-Star (October 29, 2017). Fairfax ran for public office for the first time in 2013, seeking the Democratic nomination for state attorney general. He lost to Mark Herring, but surprised party insiders with his strong performance in the primary. Herring defeated Fairfax by about 4,500 votes out of 141,600 cast in a closer-than-expected race. The Washington Post praised both candidates during the primary, but endorsed Fairfax, writing that he had displayed \\"an agile and impressive command of the issues with a prosecutor's passion for justice.\\" After the race, Fairfax co- chaired the 2014 reelection campaign of U.S. Senator Mark Warner from Virginia. The following year, he was recruited to work at the law firm of Venable LLP, in the firm's Tysons, Virginia office. Fairfax then worked for Morrison & Foerster, a law firm which elevated him to the rank of Partner in September 2018. In July 2019, Fairfax announced that he was resigning from Morrison & Foerster, which had accepted his resignation. Lieutenant Governor of Virginia =Campaign= In 2017, Fairfax ran for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. In the Democratic primaries, he faced Gene Rossi, a federal prosecutor, who had trained Fairfax when they worked together in Alexandria's Eastern District federal court, and Susan Platt, a political lobbyist and consultant, who had served as chief of staff to Joe Biden in the 1990s (Platt had also run Virginia Senator Chuck Robb's 1994 re-election campaign and Don Beyer's unsuccessful 1997 gubernatorial campaign). Citing their unease with Dominion Energy's planned construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, all three candidates in the Democratic primary pledged to refuse campaign contributions from Dominion Energy, despite the company being the largest contributor to Virginia political campaigns for both Republicans and Democrats. Although early polling showed Platt in the lead, Fairfax significantly outraised both of his opponents and proved victorious in the primary election, carrying about 49% of the vote. Fairfax then faced Republican nominee Jill Vogel, a state senator from Fauquier County, in the general election. Fairfax and Vogel raised comparable amounts of money for their campaigns$3.9 million and $3.7 million, respectively.Patricia Sullivan, Democrats Fairfax, Herring win Virginia lieutenant governor, attorney general races, Washington Post (November 7, 2017). A forum between Fairfax and Vogel was held at Piedmont Community College on August 9, 2017 and a debate between the two candidates was held at the University of Richmond on October 5. Noting that Fairfax had been largely unknown when he ran for Attorney General four years earlier, The Washington Post wrote that Fairfax had transitioned from \\"party crasher\\" to \\"party insider\\" in the time since, having \\"methodically done the work necessary to raise his profile and pay dues.\\" The Washington Post went onto endorse Fairfax in the race, calling him \\"bright, competent, well-versed\\" and \\"the much better choice\\".The Post's endorsements in Virginia, Washington Post (October 18, 2017). Fairfax's opposition to the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines led to him being omitted from a small number of campaign flyers that were distributed by the campaign for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ralph Northam. These flyers were released at the request of Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA), which supports the pipeline - LIUNA had endorsed Northam (and Northam's running mate for Attorney General, Mark Herring, who was included on the flyer), but not Fairfax. As Fairfax is black, while Northam and Herring are both white, some activists criticized the Northam campaign's decision to accommodate LIUNA's request. Fairfax responded to the controversy by saying, \\"This should not have happened, and it should not happen again, and there needs to be robust investment in making sure that we are communicating with African American voters and we are engaging our base.\\" The Fairfax campaign later remarked that the Democratic ticket was \\"working well together\\", adding \\"One piece of literature does not change that.\\" All houses that received the LIUNA flyers also received standard campaign flyers including Fairfax. In the final days of the campaign, former Virginia governor Douglas Wilder weighed in on the flyer controversy, saying that Fairfax had not \\"been dealt a good hand\\". Wilder endorsed Fairfax, but never endorsed Northam. As the election drew to a close, Fairfax and Vogel aired attack ads against each other.Patrick Wilson, Vogel, Fairfax close their race for lieutenant governor with attack ads, Richmond Times-Dispatch (November 4, 2017). Fairfax won the election by 5.5%.

Fairfax announced in December 2017 that he will be leaving his law firm, Venable. His law partner at Venable, Larry Roberts, served as his campaign chairman during the election and is currently serving as his chief of staff. In September 2018, Fairfax joined the law firm of Morrison & Foerster, continuing the historic practice of Virginia lieutenant governors maintaining employment while in office.Laura Vozzella, Like part-timers before him, Virginia‚Äôs lieutenant governor gets a gig on the side, Washington Post (September 4, 2018).

Tyson, an associate professor at Scripps College and fellow at Stanford University, of sexual assault at a hotel at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Tyson said she had suppressed memories of the event but began telling close friends about it when she saw pictures of Fairfax running for lieutenant governor in 2017. Tyson had first approached The Washington Post with her allegation after Fairfax won election in November 2017, but the Post said that it decided not to run the story because it could not corroborate the story or find similar incidents in Fairfax's past. Tyson also approached a friend, Virginia Congressman Bobby Scott, with the allegation around the same time, but Scott declined to act on it. According to The New York Times, at least six friends of Tyson reported that she told them about the alleged assault between 2017 and 2018 but she had no real time corroboration from 2004. Fairfax denied the accusation, saying his encounter with Tyson was consensual and the timing of the reports was intended to smear him; beginning February 1, after the discovery of a racist photo on Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook, there had been widespread calls for Northam to resign and let Fairfax become Governor of Virginia. Fairfax also insinuated that supporters of Northam, or someone connected with Richmond mayor Levar Stoney, a potential political rival since both were speculated as possible Democratic candidates for governor in 2021, may have been behind the allegation going public. Tyson released a statement detailing her allegations, saying the encounter started as consensual kissing but ended with Fairfax forcing her to perform oral sex on him. Tyson said she is a Democrat with no political agenda and felt compelled to release the statement because Fairfax \\"has tried to brand me as a liar to a national audience, in service to his political ambitions, and has threatened litigation.\\" In response, Fairfax issued a statement saying, \\"I wish her no harm or humiliation, nor do I seek to denigrate her or diminish her voice. But I cannot agree with a description of events that I know is not true.\\" NBC News reported that Fairfax used a misogynistic profanity to describe Tyson in a private staff meeting after the allegation came out, according to two sources in the meeting. Fairfax's chief of staff and policy director conceded that he did use profanity but denied it was towards his accuser and Fairfax demanded NBC and its reporters retract their reporting. After the story broke, Fairfax hired the same legal team that represented Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation process, while Tyson hired the same legal team that represented Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford. Virginia Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton tweeted her support for Tyson. On February 8, 2019, a second woman, Meredith Watson, came forward with sexual assault allegations against Fairfax, alleging that he raped her in a \\"premeditated and aggressive\\" attack in 2000 when both were undergraduate students at Duke University. A college friend of Watson stated she remembered Watson telling her about the assault the day after it happened. Watson said she had been previously raped by a Duke basketball player, later identified as Corey Maggette, and brought the matter to the dean but was discouraged from pursuing the matter.Duke Investigating Rape Allegation Made by Meredith Watson (Bloomberg) Watson's attorney said that Watson had one interaction with Fairfax after the alleged assault outside a campus party, during which Watson said \\"Why did you do it?\\" and reported Fairfax replied, \\"I knew that because of what happened to you last year, you‚Äôd be too afraid to say anything.\\"2nd Fairfax accuser says she was raped by former Duke basketball player Corey Maggette (CNN) Watson's attorney said this showed Fairfax \\"used the prior rape of his 'friend' against her when he chose to rape her in a premeditated way.\\"Second woman accuses Virginia Lt.

It was founded in 1838 and is part of the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Babe Ruth married here. It is a two-story ashlar granite church which faces north. It is three bays wide and four bays deep. Its front facade includes two twin Roman arch windows each topped by a rose window, enclosed within a Roman arch lintel with keystone. History Saint Paul Catholic Church was constructed on land in Ellicott City acquired from George Ellicott, an early settler of the region. The first pastor of the church was the Rev. Henry Coskery, who prior to the establishment of the parish celebrated Mass at the nearby Castle Angelo. The church was dedicated on December 13, 1838 as the only Catholic parish between Baltimore and Frederick, Maryland. It is now the oldest active Catholic parish between Baltimore and Pittsburgh. Coskery also founded the Christian Brothers' Rock Hill College in 1857. The Rev. Augustin Verot served as pastor of the church from 1853 to 1858, and was succeeded immediately by the Rev. John Samuel Foley, who served until 1863. Both later became bishops. During the American Civil War, the basement of the church served as a hospital for both Union and Confederate soldiers. During the pastorate of the Rev. Peter Tarro (1883-1907), several structural improvements were made to the church building. Three marble altars were added to the church, as were new pews, a confessional, Statues and Stations of the Cross, stained-glass windows, a baptistery, and a church spire. In the early 1900s, many couples who eloped came to St. Paul's to get married. On October 14, 1914, Babe Ruth and his bride Margaret Helen Woodford were married in St. Paul's by the church's pastor, the Rev. Thomas Dolan. He was 19 at the time and she was 17. Ruth, who was known to fabricate certain elements of his personal history, later claimed that he \\"married [his] first wife in Elkton.\\" However, the marriage certificate lists Ellicott City as the place of his marriage. A copy of the marriage certificate is exhibited by St. Paul's in the church narthex. The church is included in the local Ellicott City Historic District. In a 1977 draft nomination for the church to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places (which appears never to have been submitted), it was noted that \\"In addition to its historical merit it is an outstanding example of American eclectic architecture, blending elements of the Gothic and Romanesque in its fenestration and entrances with simple granite architecture so indigenous to Howard County.\\" St. Paul's Church created a chapel for the students of Rock Hill College in 1859. The side chapel eventually became part of the church proper. St. Paul's served as a refuge for people during the Ellicott City flood that took place on July 30, 2016. The church's pastor, the Rev. Warren Tanghe, opened one of the church's buildings to people fleeing the floodwaters. Over 50 people stayed in the church. 2 people died in the flood. It hosted flood recovery activity in 2017. School What is now Resurrection-St. Paul School was founded as St. Paul Parish School in 1922 at the direction of the St. Paul's pastor, the Rev. Michael Ryan. In its early days it was staffed by the School Sisters of Notre Dame. In 1966, due to the growth of the school population and the lack of space on the St. Paul's property, the location was moved to Paulskirk Drive in Ellicott City, and the school was renamed St. Paul the Apostle School. In 1974, the Church of the Resurrection parish was established on the same property as the school, and it was renamed Resurrection School. In January 1990, the name was changed once more to Resurrection-St. Paul School. It is now fully supported by both parishes, and teaches students from PreK through 8th grade. In 2016, the school's enrollment was 425 students.

More than 70 others were injured and 223 people escaped. It was the deadliest structural fire in the United Kingdom since the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster and the worst UK residential fire since the Second World War. The fire was started by a malfunctioning fridge-freezer on the fourth floor. It spread rapidly up the building's exterior, bringing fire and smoke to all the residential floors. This was due to the building's cladding, the external insulation and the air gap between which enabled the stack effect. The fire burned for about 60 hours before finally being extinguished. More than 250 London Fire Brigade firefighters and 70 fire engines were involved from stations across London in efforts to control the fire, and rescue residents. More than 100 London Ambulance Service crews on at least 20 ambulances attended, joined by specialist paramedics from the Ambulance Service's Hazardous Area Response Team. The Metropolitan Police and London's Air Ambulance also assisted the rescue effort. The Grenfell Tower Inquiry began on 14 September 2017 to investigate the causes of the fire and other related issues. Findings from the first report of the inquiry were released in October 2019 and addressed the events of the night. It affirmed that the building's exterior did not comply with regulations and was the central reason why the fire spread, and that the fire service were too late in advising residents to evacuate. A second phase to investigate the broader causes began on the third anniversary in 2020. the fire is currently being investigated by the police, a public inquiry, and coroner's inquests. Among the issues being investigated are the management of the building by the Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council and Kensington and Chelsea TMO (or KCTMO, which was responsible for the borough's council housing) and the responses of the Fire Brigade, the council and other government agencies. In the aftermath of the fire, the council's leader, deputy leader and chief executive resigned, and the council took direct control of council housing from the KCTMO. The national government commissioned an independent review of building regulations and fire safety, which published a report in May 2018. Across the UK and in some other countries, local governments have investigated other tower blocks to find others that have similar cladding. Efforts to replace the cladding on these buildings are ongoing. Background Map of the western side of the Lancaster West Estate. The fire also severely affected three low-rise \\"finger blocks\\" adjoining Grenfell Tower. =Building and construction= Grenfell Tower was part of the Lancaster West Estate, a council housing complex in North Kensington. The 24-storey tower block was designed in 1967 in the Brutalist style of the era by Clifford Wearden and Associates, and the Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council approved its construction in 1970. The building was constructed by contractors A E Symes of Leyton from 1972‚Äì74. The tall building contained 120 one- and two-bedroom flats. The upper 20 of 24 storeys were residential floors, with each having a communal lobby and six dwellings, with ten bedrooms between them. The lower four storeys were originally used for non-residential purposes. Later, two lower floors were converted to residential use, bringing the total to 129 apartments, housing up to 600 people. The original lead architect for the building, Nigel Whitbread, said in 2016 that the tower had been designed with attention to strength following the 1968 Ronan Point disaster and \\"from what I can see could last another hundred years.\\" Like many other tower blocks in the UK, Grenfell Tower was designed to be operated under a \\"stay put policy\\" in the event of fire. The idea was that if a fire broke out in one flat, thick walls and fire doors would contain the fire long enough for the fire service to bring it under control. Only those in the affected dwelling would be expected to evacuate. The building was designed under the assumption that a full evacuation would never be necessary. There was no centrally activated fire alarm and only a single central staircase. Unlike in many other countries, UK regulations do not require a second. In 2010, a fire broke out in a lobby and was quickly extinguished. =Management= Until 1996, Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council managed its council housing directly. In 1996, the council created Kensington and Chelsea TMO (KCTMO), a tenant management organisation which would manage its council housing stock. KCTMO had a board comprising eight residents (tenants or leaseholders), four council-appointed members and three independent members. The tower was built as council housing, but fourteen of the flats had been bought under the Right to Buy policy. These were occupied by leaseholders, or were privately rented out by them on the open market. =Renovation= Grenfell Tower in 2009, before the renovation and the installation of the cladding Grenfell Tower underwent a major renovation, announced in 2012 and conducted over 2015‚Äì16. The tower received new windows, a water-based heating system for individual flats and new aluminium composite rainscreen cladding. According to the application, the purpose of the cladding was to improve heating and energy efficiency, and external appearance. Mark Harris, of Harley Facades, said, \\"from a selfish point of view\\", his company's preference was to use (cheaper) aluminium composite material. Two types of cladding were used: Arconic's Reynobond PE, which consists of two -coated aluminium sheets that are fusion bonded to both sides of a polyethylene core; and Reynolux aluminium sheets. Beneath these, and fixed to the outside of the walls of the flats, was Celotex RS5000 PIR thermal insulation. An alternative cladding with better fire resistance was refused due to cost. The original contractor, Leadbitter, had been dropped by KCTMO because their price of ¬£11.278 million was ¬£1.6 million higher than the proposed budget. The contract was put out to competitive tender and won by Rydon, whose bid was ¬£2.5 million less than Leadbitter's. Rydon carried out the refurbishment for ¬£8.7 million, with Artelia on contract administration and Max Fordham as specialist mechanical and electrical consultants. The cladding was fitted by Harley Facades of Crowborough, East Sussex, at a cost of ¬£2.6 million. =Safety concerns= Residents had expressed significant safety concerns before the fire. Twelve years earlier, a report had criticised the tower's emergency lighting.Grenfell: report criticised 'inadequate' management 12 years before fire The Guardian The Grenfell Action Group (GAG) ran a blog in which it highlighted major safety problems, criticising the council and KCTMO for neglecting fire safety and building maintenance. In 2013, the group published a 2012 fire risk assessment by a KCTMO Health and Safety Officer which recorded safety concerns. Firefighting equipment at the tower had not been checked for up to four years; on-site fire extinguishers had expired, and some had the word \\"condemned\\" written on them because they were so old. GAG documented its attempts to contact KCTMO management; they also alerted the council's cabinet member for Housing and Property but said they never received a reply. In 2013 the council threatened one of the bloggers with legal action, saying that their posts amounted to \\"defamation and harassment\\". Two women living in Grenfell Tower, Mariem Elgwahry and Nadia Choucair, were threatened with legal action by KCTMO after they campaigned for improved fire safety. They later died in the fire, at the age of 27 and 33. In January 2016, GAG warned that people might be trapped in the building if a fire broke out, pointing out that the building had only one entrance and exit, and corridors that had been allowed to fill with rubbish, such as old mattresses. GAG frequently cited other fires in tower blocks when it warned of the hazards at Grenfell. In November 2016, GAG attacked KCTMO as an \\"evil, unprincipled, mini-mafia\\" and accused the council of ignoring health and safety laws. GAG suggested that \\"only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of [KCTMO]\\", adding, \\"[We] predict that it won't be long before the words of this blog come back to haunt the KCTMO management and we will do everything in our power to ensure that those in authority know how long and how appallingly our landlord has ignored their responsibility to ensure the heath [sic] and safety of their tenants and leaseholders. They can't say that they haven't been warned!\\" The Grenfell Tower Leaseholders' Association had also raised concerns about exposed gas pipes in the months before the fire. As with the majority of tower blocks in the UK, Grenfell Tower did not have fire sprinklers. Meanwhile, in June 2016, an independent assessor had highlighted 40 serious issues with fire safety at Grenfell Tower and recommended action to be taken within weeks. In October, the assessor asked the KCTMO why there had been no action taken for more than 20 issues in the June report. In November 2016, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority served a fire deficiency notice, listing many fire safety issues at Grenfell Tower that required action from KCTMO by May 2017. Areas of concern identified included fire doors, the smoke venting system and the firefighters' lift controls.Grenfell fire warnings issued months before blaze, documents show The Guardian Previous cladding fires and responses One of the earliest fires that involved cladding materials was the 1973 Summerland disaster on the Isle of Man, which caused 50 deaths. Part of the reason why the fire spread rapidly through the leisure centre was the acrylic sheeting on the exterior of the building. In the 1991 Knowsley Heights fire, fire spread up the entire height of an 11-storey building due to its exterior cladding, though it did not enter the interior and nobody was injured. In 2009, external composite panels also played a role in the spread of the Lakanal House fire in Southwark. An article in The Guardian three days after the Grenfell Tower fire described it as a \\"tragedy foretold\\", highlighting that there had been previous cladding fires such as the 2015 fire at The Marina Torch in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. In 2016, a non-fatal fire at a Shepherd's Bush tower block spread to six floors via flammable external cladding. In May 2017, the London Fire Brigade (LFB) warned all 33 London councils to review the use of panels and \\"take appropriate action to mitigate the fire risk\\". Fire =Initial fire (00:50‚Äì01:15)= The fire started in the early hours of Wednesday 14 June 2017 at around 00:50 BST (UTC+1), when a fridge-freezer caught fire in Flat 16, on the fourth floor. The flat's resident was woken by a smoke alarm. He entered the kitchen and discovered the fridge-freezer smoking. He alerted his lodgers and neighbours, then called the LFB at 00:54. The first two fire engines (\\"pumps\\") arrived six minutes later. The initial incident commander said that the fire was visible at this point as a \\"glow\\" in the window. A further two pumps were also dispatched. Any residents of the tower who called the fire service were told to remain in their flat unless it was affected, which is the standard policy for a fire in a high-rise building, as each flat should be fireproofed from its neighbours. Also due to this policy, the building had no central fire alarm. Most of the firefighters entered the building. They set up a bridgehead (internal base of operations) on the second floor and connected hoses to the dry riser. They first entered Flat 16 at 01:07. It was a further seven minutes before they began tackling the kitchen blaze. At approximately 01:08, the fire began to penetrate the window frame. Within a few minutes, it was setting the surrounding cladding panels on fire. Observing this, the incident commander requested another two pumps and an aerial appliance at 01:13, which also triggered the dispatch of more senior officers, a fire investigation unit and two command vehicles. Another firefighter was asked to try to prevent it spreading with a water jet, though this jet could not reach higher than the fourth floor, and due to fears of causing a dangerous build-up of steam on the inside, it was not aimed directly at the window.Inquiry, 26 June 2018, p86-90 =Rapid upward spread (01:15‚Äì01:30)= By the time the firefighters began extinguishing the kitchen fire, a column of flames was quickly advancing up the side of the building. At 01:15, a firefighter discovered smoke in Flat 26 (directly above Flat 16), another discovered residents who had fled smoke on the fifth and sixth floors, and large quantities of debris began falling from the burning fa√ßade. The flames spread up the side at a \\"terrifying rate\\". Attempts to fight the fire with an external jet were unsuccessful, as it was mostly burning behind the waterproof rainscreen. By 01:30, a rising column of flames had reached the roof and the fire was out of control. The fire on the eastern exterior spread sideways and brought smoke and flames into multiple flats. By 01:18, 34 of 293 residents had escaped. The busiest phase of evacuations was between 01:18 and 01:38, when 110 escaped, with many being woken up by their smoke alarms when smoke entered their flat. Due to Ramadan, many observing Muslim residents were awake for the pre-dawn meal of suhur, which enabled them to alert neighbours.  LFB rapidly escalated its response during this time period. The number of pumps in attendance was raised from six to eight at 01:19, with a specialist fire-rescue unit, bulk breathing apparatus carrier and damage control unit being sent too. Pumps were made up to 10 at 01:24, then to 15 at 01:27 along with a second aerial platform. Two minutes later pumps were made 20 and two more fire-rescue units were mobilised, and pumps were made up to 25 at 01:35, also triggering the dispatch of an Assistant Commissioner. Dany Cotton, the Commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, was also called out and began driving to the scene from her home in Kent. The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) were called at 01:24 to manage the gathering crowd outside. Five minutes later, the London Ambulance Service were also called. =Trapped residents and rescue missions (01:30‚Äì02:04)= Due to fire doors not closing and sealing properly, smoke began to spread from affected flats into the lobbies. By 01:33, LFB were receiving calls from residents who reported being trapped in their flats. At some point between 01:30 and 01:40, smoke began to enter the stairwell. The Inquiry later estimated that despite this, the stairs were still passable for over half an hour. Evacuation rates slowed, with 20 escaping between 01:38 and 01:58. More than half of those still trapped at 01:58 were killed, while 48 were rescued between 01:58 and 03:58. The fire continued to spread sideways on the exterior, and by 01:42 had reached the north side. LFB call handlers collected information from trapped residents and this was relayed to the LFB's command unit that was parked outside. Communicating through radio proved difficult, due to noise, the sheer volume of talk and possibly the concrete building structure. Instead, details of trapped residents were written on slips of paper and ferried by runners from the command unit to the bridgehead on the second floor. At the bridgehead, incoming firefighters were assigned flats to go to and briefed on whom they would need to rescue. They donned breathing apparatus and headed to the flat to search for its residents. The firefighters encountered thick smoke, zero visibility and extreme heat when they climbed above the fourth floor. Furthermore, some residents had moved location to escape the smoke. Three firefighters who went to rescue a 12-year old girl on the 20th floor were unable to find her. Unknown to them, she had moved up to a flat on the 23rd floor, was on the phone to a control operator who had no means of knowing what the firefighters were doing, and later died in this location. Another two firefighters were sent to a flat on the 14th floor with a single resident, only to find 8 people (four of them eventually escaped). =Major incident declared (02:04‚Äì04:00)= Witnesses reported seeing people trapped inside the burning building, switching the lights in their flats on and off or waving from windows to attract help, some holding children. Eyewitnesses reported seeing some people jumping out, and four victims were later found to have died from \\"injuries consistent with falling from a height\\". At least one person used knotted blankets to make a rope and escape from the burning building. Frequent explosions that were reported to be from gas lines in the building were heard. Outside operations were hindered by falling debris, including burning pieces of cladding. Due to this danger, the police moved crowds away from the building as a safety precaution. The MPS Territorial Support Group was present; besides being a specialist unit for public order policing, they provided riot shields to protect firefighters from falling debris. Shortly after 02:00, a major incident was declared and the number of fire engines was raised from 25 to 40, the number of fire-rescue units increased to 10, command vehicles to six, aerial platforms to four, and operational support units to two. Over the course of the operation, 250 firefighters attempted to control the blaze, with more than 100 firefighters inside the building at a given time. Assistant Commissioner Andrew Roe assumed direct command of firefighting operations for the next 11 hours. Rather than command the operations directly, Commissioner Cotton served as a Monitoring Officer, overseeing Roe and providing moral support to firefighters. She admitted that LFB had broken their own safety protocols by entering a large building without knowing whether it was in danger of structural collapse. It was not until the following afternoon that structural engineers were able to assess the structure and determine that it was not in danger of collapse. By 02:20, the level of smoke in the stairwell constituted a threat to life, although some survivors did escape beyond then. At 02:47 the \\"stay put\\" policy, advising those residents in areas unaffected by the blaze to remain there, was abandoned in favour of general evacuation. After this point only 36 further residents were able to escape. Experts on the subsequent inquiry into the disaster later said that the \\"stay put\\" policy should have been discarded an hour and twenty minutes before it eventually was. =Final rescues (04:00‚Äì08:07)= Grenfell Tower in the early morning of 14 June. The burnt cladding is visible on the outside of the building. By sunrise, firefighters were still busy fighting the fire and attempting rescues on the inside. At 04:14, police addressed the large crowd of onlookers and urgently instructed them to contact anyone they knew who was trapped in the building‚Äîif they are able to reach them via phone or Twitter‚Äîto tell them they must try to self- evacuate and not wait for the fire brigade. By 04:44, all sides of the building had been affected. Only two further rescues took place, with one resident being rescued at 06:05 and the last being rescued at 08:07. Firefighters rescued all remaining residents up to the 10th floor and all but two up to the 12th floor, but none got higher than the 20th floor during this time; only two people escaped from the highest two floors. =Residual fire (08:07 ‚Äì 16 June)= Grenfell Tower two days after the fire broke out At a news conference in the afternoon of 14 June, LFB reported firefighters had rescued 65 people from the building and reached all 24 floors. Seventy-four people were confirmed by the NHS to be in six hospitals across London with 20 of them in critical care. The fire continued to burn on the tower's upper floors. It was not brought under control until 01:14 on 15 June and firefighters were still damping down pockets of fire when the Brigade issued an update on 16 June. The fire brigade also used a drone to inspect the building and search for casualties. The fire was declared extinguished on the evening of 16 June. Reporting Reporting of the disaster escalated as follows: * By 05:00, police reported that several people were being treated for smoke inhalation. * By 06:30, it was reported that 50 people had been taken to five hospitals: Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, King's College Hospital, Royal Free, St Thomas's, and St Mary's Hospital. * By 09:30, London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton reported that there were fatalities resulting from the fire, but she could not specify how many had been killed because of the size and complexity of the building. Cotton said: \\"This is an unprecedented incident. In my 29 years of being a firefighter, I have never ever seen anything of this scale.\\" * By 12:00 the Metropolitan Police announced there were six people confirmed dead, and more than 70 in hospital, with 20 in critical condition. Live coverage, frequently updated. The first person announced dead was Mohammed al-Haj Ali, a Syrian refugee. A large number of people were reported missing. * At around 17:00, the number of confirmed deaths was increased to 12. =False accounts= In the immediate aftermath of the fire, a number of unsubstantiated reports about casualties circulated online, which were to later be debunked, including that the government had covered up details of the fire and babies' miraculous survival stories. A later investigation by BBC Panorama found no evidence that these survival accounts were credible: neither the Metropolitan Police, London Ambulance Service nor any A&E; departments were able to find any record of this happening. Impact =Deaths= The fire caused 72 deaths, including one who died in hospital a day later and another who died in January 2018. The latter occurred after an official death toll was announced by police in November 2017. The incident ranks as the deadliest structural fire in the United Kingdom since the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster and the worst UK residential fire since the Second World War. Police examined the remains of Grenfell Tower and used \\"every imaginable source\\" of information \\"from government agencies to fast food companies\\" to identify casualties. Their analysis of CCTV evidence concluded that 223 people (of 293 present) had escaped. This investigation took five months, with only 12 fatalities being identified on the actual day of the fire. By the following week, police had estimated that 80 people had died. This was the most widely quoted estimate in the media for several months. On 19 September 2017, Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy suggested that the number of dead could be lower than 80 because eight people were being investigated for making fraudulent financial claims for non-existent victims. By 1 June 2018, this had led to five people being convicted of fraud. Obstacles to identifying fatalities included the fact there was no formal register of who was in the building, and the number of undocumented subtenants, migrants and asylum seekers who were believed to have been living there. Mayor Sadiq Khan called for an amnesty to ensure that people with pertinent information could come forward. Survivors came from 106 of the tower's 129 flats; eighteen people among the occupants of these flats were reported as dead or missing presumed dead, whereas most of those killed were said to have been in the remaining 23 flats between the 11th and 23rd floors. Some people from lower floors may have tried to move up the building, and it is thought a number of people may have ended up in one flat. Some victims were identified from 26 calls to 999 made from inside the 23 flats. The dead included many children, five of whom were students at the nearby Kensington Aldridge Academy. The youngest of those known killed, Leena Belkadi, was 6 months old. One victim died in hospital on 15 June 2017 due to inhalation of fire fumes.  Additionally, one then pregnant survivor lost her baby through stillbirth as a result of the fire. The first Coroner's Inquests opened on 23 August 2017 and all other inquests were opened by 23 November 2017. In the aftermath of the fire, members of the local community, including a residents group called Grenfell United, * stated that the official figures were far short of existing estimates, with some believing that the death toll was \\"in hundreds\\". * Ten days after the fire, only 18 deaths had yet been officially recorded, compared to the estimate of 80 and the eventual figure of 72. Rumours that the toll was higher than official figures persisted after the official figures were confirmed. =Psychological health and human factors= Beyond physical injury, the fire was a traumatic event which had a psychological impact on residents, emergency service workers and the public at large, as detailed below. On 26 July 2017, at the fourth public meeting of the Grenfell Response Team, a local volunteer reported that there had been at least 20 suicide attempts in north Kensington since the fire, one of which had been successful. The mental health of many survivors has been damaged.Grenfell Tower: The mental health toll BBC LFB Commissioner Dany Cotton defended the heroism of emergency service workers who themselves were affected by trauma. An on-call counsellor was made available. Around 80 firefighters and Met Police officers were reported to be suffering from their experiences. Cotton told LBC Radio that she too was undergoing counselling. An extra four full- time counsellors were employed (reversing previous staff reductions) and 60 volunteer counsellors were brought in. All firefighters who attended Grenfell were given a psychological health check. The BBC reported that LFB used its reserve budget to bring counselling staff back to 2008 levels. In July 2017, NHS England issued an open letter to GPs giving advice on symptoms for mental health conditions such as PTSD that those affected by this fire (or recent terrorism) may be experiencing. It is estimated that 67% of people caught up in the fire, who lost relatives, were rescued or evacuated from the tower, need treatment for PTSD. Further between 26% and 48% of people living nearby who were not evacuated but witnessed the fire helplessly have PTSD. It is unclear how far this indicates reaction to the fire and how far previously existing psychiatric conditions are being uncovered.Most Grenfell Tower survivors show signs of PTSD ‚Äì council study The Guardian The Metropolitan Police Service assigned 250 detectives to the fire, placing additional workload and personal stress on a force that was also investigating recent terrorist incidents, including the London Bridge and Finsbury Park attacks. Psychologists are working at Kensington Aldridge Academy to support students returning to the original site. Measures have been taken to protect student welfare, such as shielding classroom windows overlooking the tower. =Long- term physical health= On 21 September 2018, the coroner, Fiona Wilcox, expressed concern for the long term physical health of victims and emergency service workers exposed to smoke and dust inhaled during the fire, and its subsequent clear up. Those affected could be at increased risk of conditions such as cancer, asbestosis, COPD and asthma. The tower is known to have contained asbestos and other toxins. In her letter to NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, Wilcox notes that firefighters involved in the September 11 attacks suffered significant health problems from smoke inhalation. She asked for a physical health screening programme to be established to help prevent future deaths. Public Health England have been monitoring the quality of the air around the derelict tower. In a March 2019 report, they stated that \\"the risk to public health from air pollution remains low.\\" While the fire itself released many toxic chemicals, they were quickly dispersed in the wind. There has not been a full assessment of the risk posed by soil contamination. Also in March 2019, an independent study led by Professor Anna Stec reported in the journal Chemosphere that research had uncovered \\"significant environmental contamination\\" in the soil and buildings around the local area, including significant concentrations of benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, phosphorus and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Chemicals in the soil are unlikely to seep into the air, but could be uncovered through activities such as gardening. Stec said her findings showed \\"the need for further in-depth, independent analysis to quantify any risks to residents.\\" =Costs= Grenfell Tower was insured by Protector Forsikring ASA for ¬£20 million, but the direct costs of the fire are likely to be substantially higher. According to The Times, the financial impact of the fire could reach as high as ¬£1 billion due to a combination of litigation, compensation for deaths and injuries, rehousing and rehabilitation, the cost of demolition and rebuilding and the possibility that other tower blocks may have to be improved or evacuated. Councils said the government is not releasing funds to increase fire safety in many other tower blocks after the Grenfell fire although they promised lack of finance would not prevent essential work. The government is not paying to put sprinklers into older tall buildings though sprinklers are required in new buildings over 30 metres tall. In the 22 November 2017 Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced that an extra ¬£28 million was being provided to help victims. He asked that local authorities without the means to make buildings safe should contact central government. Of the fire he said: \\"This tragedy should never have happened, and we must ensure that nothing like it ever happens again.\\" On 4 January 2018, BBC News reported the Met Police were asking the Home Office to pay for the investigation, which was one of the largest, most complex and most expensive in its history. A figure of ¬£38 million was quoted. On 9 May 2019, Housing Secretary James Brokenshire announced the ¬£200m cost of replacing cladding on private tower blocks would be paid for by the Government, reversing the position of leaving costs to owners. Aftermath A total of 151 homes were destroyed in the tower and surrounding area. People from surrounding buildings were evacuated due to concerns that the tower might collapse. The fire also severely affected three low-rise \\"finger blocks\\" adjoining Grenfell Tower. Their residents were evacuated due to the fire. The blocks, Barandon Walk, Testerton Walk and Hurstway Walk, also lost access to hot water as they shared a boiler beneath Grenfell Tower that was destroyed in the fire. Direct causes =Refrigerator= It was initially reported that the fire had been started by a faulty refrigerator. Police confirmed on 23 June that a faulty fridge-freezer had initially started the fire and named the model as a FF175BP fridge-freezer produced under the Hotpoint brand for Whirlpool. Owners of the types FF175BP and FF175BG were urged to register their appliance with the manufacturer to receive any updates. Sixty-four thousand of these models were made between March 2006 and July 2009, after which the model was discontinued. It is unknown how many are still in use. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) commissioned a product safety investigation into the Hotpoint FF175B fridge-freezer. Independent experts examined the remains of the appliance recovered from Grenfell and exemplar models of the same type. They concluded that the design met all legal safety requirements, and there was no need to issue a recall of the model. Consumer group Which? complained that the legal requirements were inadequate. Tenants had repeatedly complained about electrical power surges causing appliances to smoke and such a surge may have set the fridge-freezer on fire. The local authority knew about complaints and had paid tenants compensation for damaged appliances. Judith Blakeman, a local Labour councillor, said the surges affected many appliances including fridges. Blakeman maintains that the cause of the surges was never solved.Electricity problems at Grenfell Tower 'never resolved' BBC On 27 November 2018, evidence given to the Grenfell Tower inquiry by electrical investigating engineer Dr J. Duncan Glover suggested that in Flat 16 the fridge-freezer compressor relay wiring was not tightly fitted. In his view, this probably created additional electrical resistance leading to overheating and igniting the outer plastic insulation of the wire at 90¬∞C. Glover described the state of the fusebox following a short circuit to the compressor. During questioning, he compared US and UK safety standards, noting that US regulations require a steel back to the fridge to help contain a fire, whereas UK fridges were allowed to have only a plastic backing. =Exterior cladding and insulation= thumbuprightAnatomy of Grenfell Tower cladding.  The structure consists of 3 mm cladding (Reynobond PE), 50 mm ventilated cavity, 150 mm insulation (Celotex RS5000) and 250 mm existing concrete. The newly renovated fa√ßade of the tower is believed to have been built as follows:  * exterior cladding: aluminium sandwich plates (3 mm each) with polyethylene core * a standard ventilation gap (50 mm) between the cladding and the insulation behind it * an insulation made of PIR (polyisocyanurate) foam plates (150 mm) mounted on the existing facade * the existing prefabricated reinforced-concrete facade * new double-glazed windows of unknown type and material, mounted in the same vertical plane as the PIR foam insulation plates Both the aluminium- polyethylene cladding and the PIR insulation plates failed fire safety tests conducted after the fire, according to the police.Siddique, Haroon, \\"Grenfell Tower fire: police considering manslaughter charges\\", The Guardian, 23 June 2017. Earlier in 2014, safety experts had cautioned that the planned insulation was only suitable for use with non-combustible cladding. The Guardian saw a certificate from the building inspectors' organisation, Local Authority Building Control (LABC), which stated that the chosen insulation for the refit should only be used on tall buildings with fibre cement panels, which do not burn. Combustible panels with polyethylene were put up on top of insulation known as Celotex RS5000, made from polyisocyanurate, which burns when heated, giving off toxic cyanide fumes. Despite the above, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea certified the Grenfell tower building work as allegedly conforming to \\"the relevant provisions\\". Council building inspectors visited the site 16 times from August 2014 to July 2016. Kooltherm, a phenolic insulation, was also used on Grenfell. Kooltherm was never tested with polyethylene core aluminium panels according to the manufacturer. The manufacturer, Kingspan, \\"would be very surprised if such a system [...] would ever pass the appropriate British Standard 8414 large-scale test\\". Kooltherm's LABC certificate states phenolic products, \\"do not meet the limited combustibility requirements\\" of building regulations.Booth, Robert,\\"Grenfell Tower: insulation was not certified for use with flammable cladding\\", The Guardian, 13 July 2017. The combustible materials used on Grenfell Tower were considerably cheaper than non-combustible alternatives would have been. There appear to have been intense cost pressures over the Grenfell refurbishment. In June 2017, it was stated the project team chose cheaper cladding that saved ¬£293,368, after the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation mentioned in an email the need for \\"good costs for Cllr Fielding Mellen [the council's former deputy leader]\\". A building control officer from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea reportedly passed the cladding on Grenfell Tower on 15 May 2015, though there was a nationwide warning that the combustible insulation used should only be used with cladding that does not burn.Booth, Robert, \\"Flammable Grenfell Tower cladding 'passed' by council officer in 2015\\", The Guardian, 14 July 2017.  Aluminium-polyethylene cladding  Structure of an ACM sandwich panel. In the case of Reynobond PE, the aluminium sheets' thickness is and overall panel thickness is either 3, 4, or 6 mm. Fire safety experts have said that the building's new external cladding was a possible cause of the rapid spread of the fire. Experts said the gap between the cladding and the insulation worked like a chimney to spread the fire. The cladding could be seen burning and melting, causing additional speculation that it was not made of fire-resistant material. One resident said: \\"The whole one side of the building was on fire. The cladding went up like a matchstick.\\" Concerns about the dangers of external cladding were raised years before, following a fire in 1991 at flats in Knowsley Heights, Merseyside. *\\"Knowsley Heights (Fire)\\", Hansard, 20 January 1997. *\\"Memorandum by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (ROF 31)\\" , Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs, July 1999, p. 10. Recent major high-rise fires that have involved flammable cladding are listed below. Records show that a contractor had been paid ¬£2.6 million to install an \\"ACM rainscreen over-clad\\" during the recent refurbishment at Grenfell Tower. ACM stands for \\"aluminium composite material\\", also known as a sandwich panel, the combustibility of which depends on the choice of insulation core material. One of the products used was Arconic's Reynobond, which is available with different types of core material‚Äîpolyethylene, as reportedly used in Grenfell Tower (Reynobond PE), or a more fire-resistant material (Reynobond FR). The Reynobond cladding reportedly cost ¬£24 per square metre for the fire-retardant version, and ¬£22 for the combustible version. According to Arconic's website and brochure for the mainland European market at the time of the fire, the Reynobond PE cladding used was suitable only for buildings 10 metres or less tall; the fire-retardant Reynobond FR was suitable for buildings up to 30 metres tall; and above the latter height, such as the upper parts of Grenfell Tower, the non-combustible A2 version was supposed to be used (\\"As soon as the building is higher than the firefighters' ladders, it has to be conceived with an incombustible material\\"). After the fire, Arconic stopped sales of Reynobond PE worldwide for tower blocks.\\"Grenfell Tower: Cladding firm ends global sales for tower blocks\\", BBC News, 26 June 2017. Similar cladding containing highly flammable insulation material is believed to have been installed on thousands of other high-rise buildings in countries including Britain, France, the UAE and Australia. Advice published by the Centre for Window and Cladding Technology is that where such materials are used in buildings over 18m, the fire performance of the cladding system as a whole must be proven by testing. In September 2014, a building regulations notice for the re-cladding work was submitted to the authority and marked with a status of \\"Completed‚Äînot approved\\". The use of a \\"Building Notice\\" building control application is used to remove the need to submit detailed plans and proposals to a building control inspector in advance, where the works performed will be approved by the inspector during the course of their construction. Building inspector Geoff Wilkinson remarked that this type of application is \\"wholly inappropriate for large complex buildings and should only be used on small, simple domestic buildings\\". On 18 June, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond stated that the cladding used on Grenfell Tower was banned in the United Kingdom. Grenfell Tower was inspected 16 times while the cladding was being put on but none of these inspections noticed that materials effectively banned in tall buildings were being used. Judith Blakeman, local Labour councillor questioned the competence of the inspectors. Blakeman, representing the Grenfell residents, said, \\"This raises the question of whether the building regulations officers were sufficiently competent and did they know what they were looking at. It also begs a question about what they were actually shown. Was anything concealed from them?\\" The Department for Communities and Local Government stated that cladding with a polyethylene core \\"would be non-compliant with current Building Regulations guidance. This material should not be used as cladding on buildings over in height.\\" On 31 July 2017, the Department released results of fire safety testing on the cladding panels used at Grenfell Tower, which were carried out by the Building Research Establishment and assigned the polyethylene filling a category three rating, designating a total lack of flame retardant properties. According to US-based Arconic, the polyethylene version of the material is banned in the United States for use in buildings exceeding in height, because of the risk of spreading fire and smoke. NPR subsequently stated that nearly all jurisdictions in the US (except three states and the District of Columbia) have enacted the International Building Code (IBC) requirement that external wall assemblies (cladding, insulation, and wall) on high-rise buildings with combustible components must pass a rigorous real-world simulation test promulgated by the National Fire Protection Association under the name NFPA 285. To perform the test, the entire planned assembly is constructed on a standardised test rig two storeys tall, with a window opening in the middle, and is continuously ignited with gas burners from two different angles for 30 minutes. The assembly must satisfy numerous performance criteria to pass, including a requirement that flames cannot spread more than vertically from the top of the window opening or horizontally. A single NFPA 285 test can cost over US$30,000, and it certifies only a particular assembly, meaning that any change to any part used requires a new test. As of mid-2017 ACM cladding with a polyethylene core had not been able to pass the NFPA 285 test, and thus had been effectively banned on US high-rise buildings for decades. The UK does not mandate the use of such simulations. Fire safety experts said the tests the government is doing on cladding only are insufficient, as the whole unit of cladding and insulation should be tested including fire stops. Fire safety experts maintain further that the testing lacks transparency, as the government has not described what tests are being carried out.\\"Tower cladding tests after Grenfell fire lack transparency, say experts\\", The Guardian, 26 June 2017.  Polyisocyanurate insulation  The top floors of Grenfell Tower after the fire, showing the burned insulation, with portions of the original structure revealed underneath. The cladding had melted. The refurbishment also used an insulation foam product named Celotex RS5000, installed behind the cladding. Police said this insulation proved \\"more flammable than the cladding\\". According to its datasheet, the polyisocyanurate (PIR) product‚Äîcharred pieces of which littered the area around Grenfell Tower after the fire‚Äî\\"will burn if exposed to a fire of sufficient heat and intensity\\". PIR insulation foams \\"will, when ignited, burn rapidly and produce intense heat, dense smoke and gases which are irritating, flammable and/or toxic\\", among them carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. The fire toxicity of polyisocyanurate foams has been well understood for some time. At least three survivors were treated for cyanide poisoning. Simultaneous exposure to carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide is more lethal than exposure to the gases separately. Celotex's Rainscreen Compliance Guide, when specifying Celotex RS5000 in buildings above , sets out the conditions under which the product was tested and for which it has been certified as meeting the required fire safety standards. These include the use of (non-combustible) 12 mm fibre cement rainscreen panels, ventilated horizontal fire breaks at each floor slab edge and vertical non-ventilated fire breaks. It states that any changes from the tested configuration \\"will need to be considered by the building designer\\". =Cavity barriers= It has been asserted that cavity barriers intended to prevent the spread of fire in the gap between the facade and the building (the chimney effect) were of insufficient size and, in some cases, incorrectly installed, facilitating the spread of fire. =Windows= It has been asserted that windows and their surrounds installed as part of the refurbishment were less fire resistant than those they replaced due to the materials used and that the windows were of insufficient size necessitating larger surrounds. This would facilitate the spread of fire between the interior and exterior of the building. Emergency response issues Media reporting included criticism of the response of London Fire Brigade and other agencies. The Grenfell Tower Inquiry concluded in October 2019 that mistakes in the response cost lives. Despite this, it also praised the \\"courage and devotion to duty\\" of ordinary firefighters. = Stay put policy = The fire safety policy for Grenfell Tower was that residents were advised to stay in their flats (\\"stay put\\") if a fire broke out in the building, unless it was affecting their flat. This is the standard policy for a high-rise building in the United Kingdom. It relies on the assumption that construction standards such as concrete and fire-resistant doors will allow firefighters to contain a fire within one flat. This was not possible at Grenfell Tower, as the fire spread rapidly via the exterior. Due to this policy, the building was not designed to be fully evacuated. There was only a single narrow staircase, and no centrally activated system of fire alarms that could alert residents. In a July 2014 Grenfell Tower regeneration newsletter, the KCTMO instructed residents to stay in their flat in case of a fire (\\"Our longstanding 'stay put' policy stays in force until you are told otherwise\\") and stated that the front doors for each unit could survive a fire for up to 30 minutes. The May 2016 newsletter had a similar message, adding that it was on the advice of the Fire Brigade: The advice was repeated to residents who called the fire service. The policy was withdrawn at 02:47, when control room staff were instead told to advise residents to evacuate if possible.Grenfell Tower 'stay put' advice lasted nearly two hours, BBC; accessed 14 November 2017.Grenfell Tower ‚Äòstay put‚Äô fire safety protocol ‚Äòditched after two hours‚Äô, Bournemouth Daily Echo; accessed 14 November 2017. At 04:14, the police told onlookers to contact anyone still trapped in the building and tell them to attempt to evacuate immediately. Multiple survivors argued that they would have died had they followed the \\"stay put\\" advice. Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, also criticised the policy: \\"Thankfully residents didn't take that advice but fled\\". He added, \\"These are some of the questions that have to be answered. We have lots of people in London living in tower blocks ... We can't have people's lives being put at risk because of bad advice or lack of maintenance.\\"Sadiq Khan condemns \\"bad advice\\" given to Grenfell Tower residents in the event of a fire, Harper's Bazaar, accessed 14 November 2017. In her report, Barbara Lane concluded that the principles required for the \\"stay put\\" policy to work failed once the fire started spreading across the exterior. Dany Cotton said Grenfell was unique in terms of volume and behaviour of fire. She said it was a matter for the inquiry, but defended the general \\"stay put\\" policy for most high-rise buildings by reasoning that if residents all evacuate at once, they could block firefighters from entering. Furthermore, smoke and fire could be spread within a building by residents opening doors. In her later witness statement to the Inquiry, she said that as the building did not have a central fire alarm system, evacuating the building \\"would physically require someone to go and knock on every single door and tell people to come out.\\" Since the Grenfell Tower fire, LFB's policy of high- rise buildings with flammable cladding has been changed so that until the cladding is removed, landlords should install alarm systems or have patrols in place so that the building can be evacuated. The initial incident commander Watch Manager Michael Dowden told the Inquiry that he was preoccupied and uncomfortable dealing with \\"a very, very dynamic situation\\" that he was not prepared to deal with, and that he did not consider evacuating the building. He added that in hindsight, he did not believe it would have been possible, as there were not enough firefighters present to evacuate 20 floors. Station Manager Andrew Walton, who was incident commander for a short period after, said that as smoke was spreading to the stairwell and many lobbies, residents could not have escaped and he believed they were safer staying in unaffected flats. Watch Manager Brien O'Keeffe suggested it could have been a \\"catastrophe\\" to tell residents to evacuate unaided once the stairwell was filled with smoke. On the other hand, Assistant Commissioner Andrew Roe said that due to the complete failure of the building, he made a decision to change the policy soon after taking over as incident commander. The Inquiry later concluded that lives had been lost because the policy had not been lifted while the stairs were still passable. It found that the fire officers had not been trained to deal with a situation where they might have to evacuate a tower block. The use of this policy by the Fire Brigade is now under police investigation. =Fire brigade resources= Research by John Sweeney for BBC Newsnight described several issues that hampered the London Fire Brigade's response. There was insufficient mains water pressure for the hoses the fire service used and Thames Water had to be called to increase it.Lack of equipment 'hampered Grenfell rescue effort' The Guardian Also, a high ladder did not arrive for 32 minutes, by which time the fire was out of control. Matt Wrack of the Fire Brigades Union said, \\"... having that on the first attendance might have made a difference because it allows you to operate a very powerful water tower from outside the building onto the building.\\" Before the Grenfell fire, 70% of fire brigades would have automatically sent a high ladder to tower fires.London fire: Most services would have sent high ladder to Grenfell BBC An independent fire expert told the BBC having the ladder earlier could have stopped the fire getting out of control.Grenfell Tower fire: 'Half an hour' high ladder delay BBC The London Fire Brigade told Newsnight the first attendance procedure for tower fires has now been changed from four engines to five engines plus a high ladder unit. Firefighters said inside the building they lacked sufficient 'extended duration' breathing apparatus. They had difficulty getting vital radio messages through due to 'overuse of the system' and from the need to get the signal through layers of concrete. At the inquiry one firefighter described the radios as \\"useless.\\" Another issue raised was the height of the aerial appliances. London Fire Brigade's aerial appliances could reach high, whereas the tower was high. A firefighting platform was borrowed from Surrey, arriving only after the fire had been burning for several hours. Commissioner Dany Cotton said that the LFB had already been planning to buy higher ladders, and that the size of LFB's appliances has been limited by their need to fit on narrow London streets. London mayor, Sadiq Khan promised to supply new equipment that the London Fire Brigade needed promptly and stated he would not wait for the public inquiry.Grenfell Tower fire: 'Urgent review' of firefighting resources requested BBC Dany Cotton later said having more firefighters may not have helped as there would not have physically been enough room for them in the building. The single stairwell also restricted access. =Smoke= One of the major obstacles to the firefighters was that the tower's only stairwell filled with smoke within an hour of the fire breaking out. This made it very difficult for residents to escape unaided; Barbara Lane's report noted that the rate of evacuations slowed after 01:38, and again after 01:58. Furthermore, firefighters were hindered by the near-zero visibility on the stairwell. Crew Manager Aldo Diana said he was \\"surprised\\" by the amount of smoke in the stairwell, describing conditions as: In section 19 of her report, Barbara Lane notes that smoke was reported in the lobbies of four floors as early as 01:18. By 01:58, the stairwell and seven lobbies were filled with smoke. She suggested that possible causes for this included inadequate fire doors, fire doors being propped open by hoses and problems with the ventilation system. In October 2018 the London Fire Brigade announced that it is to use specialist hoods to protect people from smoke and toxic fumes for up to 15 minutes. They were purchased from German company Drager with ¬£90,000 for 650 hoods. =Road access= Kensington and Chelsea Council was warned in 2010 that building a new secondary school very near Grenfell Tower could block access by emergency vehicles. A 2013 blog post by Grenfell Action Group stated, \\"There is barely adequate room to manoeuvre for fire engines responding to emergency calls, and any obstruction of this emergency access zone could have lethal consequences in the event of a serious fire or similar emergency in Grenfell Tower or the adjacent blocks.\\" The council demolished a multi-storey car park to build the school. This added to congestion and parked cars in streets around Grenfell Tower that were already narrow and made it hard for fire engines to get to the fire.Grenfell Tower: Council knew of emergency access fears BBC =Lack of sprinklers= Like the vast majority of high-rise buildings in the UK, Grenfell Tower did not have sprinklers. A BBC Breakfast investigation focusing on half of the UK's council- and housing association-owned tower blocks found that 2% of them had full sprinkler systems. Deaths were 87% lower when buildings with sprinklers caught fire. England, Wales and Scotland now require sprinklers to be installed in newly built tall buildings, since 2007, but there is no requirement to fit them in existing buildings. Dany Cotton has called for sprinklers to be retrofitted in all social housing blocks. David Siber, an advisor to the Fire Brigades Union, said that sprinklers could have prevented the fire from ever spreading beyond the kitchen where it started. Geoff Wilkinson, the building regulations columnist for the Architects' Journal, said that once the fire starting spreading through cladding, sprinklers would have had little effect. A few days after the fire, the Conservative leader of the council Nicholas Paget- Brown was asked why sprinklers had not been installed in the tower during the recent renovation. Paget-Brown said that the Grenfell Tower residents did not have a collective view in favour of installing sprinklers during the recent renovations. He also said that if they had been installed, it would have delayed the refurbishment and been more disruptive. ITV business editor Joel Hills stated that he had been told that the installation of sprinklers had not even been discussed. Criticism of fire safety regulation Reinhard Ries, the fire chief in Frankfurt, Germany, was critical of lax fire regulations in the United Kingdom, contrasting the laws in Germany that ban flammable cladding on buildings higher than 22 m and require segregated fire-stairs and firefighting lifts which can be used by the fire brigade and injured or disabled people. Russ Timpson of the Tall Buildings Fire Safety Network told The Telegraph that \\"foreign colleagues are staggered\\" when they learn that UK regulations permit high-rise buildings to have only a single staircase, and called on government to review the relevant regulations. New high-rise buildings in England, since 2007, are required to have sprinklers with no requirement to install them in older buildings, and as a result few have sprinklers. Other notable criticisms of UK fire regulations included a change in the law in 1986 under a Conservative government that abolished a requirement that external walls should have at least one hour's fire resistance to prevent blazes from re-entering a building and spreading to other apartments. The New York Times reported that because of the Great Fire of London, UK building codes have historically been overly focused on containing horizontal fire spread between buildings or between units in larger buildings, as opposed to vertical fire spread in high-rise buildings. The Royal Institute of British Architects fears that flammable cladding will not be totally banned, and they further fear that sprinkler systems and extra escape staircases will not be required. These three measures could have saved lives in Grenfell, according to widespread beliefs.Architects fear Grenfell review will avoid ban on flammable cladding The Guardian = Reviews into fire safety in tower blocks = After the fatal Lakanal House fire in 2009, the coroner made a series of safety recommendations for the government to consider in order to improve safety in tower blocks. The report highlighted the flammable panels that covered part of the exterior, the lack of sprinklers, a lack of safety inspections, and that the stay put policy did not suit a building where compartmentalisation had failed. The Department for Communities and Local Government agreed to hold a review in 2013. Over subsequent years, four ministers were warned about tower block fire risks that had been highlighted by the Lakanal House fire. Ronnie King, a former chief fire officer and secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety, said that ministers had stonewalled requests for meetings and discussions about tightening rules. King described his attempts to arrange meetings with housing minister Gavin Barwell: \\"We have had replies, but the replies were to the effect that you have met my predecessor [earlier housing minister James Wharton] and there were a number of matters that we are looking at and we are still looking at it.\\"Revealed: the tower block fire warnings that ministers ignored The Guardian In March 2014, the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety and Rescue Group sent a letter to then Minister for Communities Stephen Williams, warning that similar fires to the one at Lakanal House were possible, especially due to the lack of sprinklers in tower blocks. After further correspondence, Williams replied: \\"I have neither seen nor heard anything that would suggest that consideration of these specific potential changes is urgent and I am not willing to disrupt the work of this department by asking that these matters are brought forward.\\" In March 2015, at the request of the Department for Communities and Local Government, fire experts at the Building Research Establishment (BRE) studies produced reports assessing the level of fire risk at tower blocks. The experts warned of fatalities unless the danger of flames passing through concealed cavities was addressed.  Other political criticism and debate  There is a political tension between those who focus the blame on technical failures, such as the refrigerator fire and the installation of flammable cladding, and those who focus the blame on politically charged explanation, such as deregulation, spending cuts and neglect. Bagehot in The Economist and Nick Ferrari accused Labour Party politicians of exploiting the disaster for political gain. In turn, Suzanne Moore in The Guardian, Tanya Gold in the New Statesman and Owen Jones argued that trying to stop the fire from being politicized meant ignoring its causes. =Government response= The government response was to eventually setup dedicated benefits line and a fund to support the survivors. =Theresa May's personal response= On the day after the fire, May made a private visit to Grenfell Tower to speak with members of the emergency services, but did not meet with any of the survivors. Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood stated this was due to security concerns. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg commented that May's decision not to meet those who lived in the tower might be interpreted as indicative of a lack of empathy. An editorial in The Guardian called it May's \\"Hurricane Katrina moment\\". Former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo described her meeting with members of the emergency services as \\"a good thing\\" but felt she \\"should have been there with the residents. She wanted an entirely controlled situation in which she didn't use her humanity\\". The following day, she visited survivors in hospital and a church that was serving as a relief centre; during the latter visit she was heckled by some of those present. An article written by former Conservative MP Matthew Parris in The Times described her as \\"a good and moral person, who wants the best for her country, and is not privately unfeeling, ... in public is crippled by personal reserve\\". Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House of Commons subsequently visited a relief centre at the Rugby Portobello Trust, where she was confronted by residents angered by May's response, and described the prime minister as being \\"absolutely heartbroken\\" over events at Grenfell Tower. In an article for the London Evening Standard on 11 June 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May wrote of her regret for the handling of the fire and its public perception. = Council response = The local council's response to the Grenfell Tower fire has been subject to widespread criticism. Council member Emma Dent Coad, also the newly elected Labour MP for the area (Kensington constituency) and a former board member of KCTMO, accused the council of having failed and betrayed its residents; characterising the fire as \\"entirely preventable\\", she added that \\"I can't help thinking that poor quality materials and construction standards may have played a part in this hideous and unforgivable event\\".Amelia Gentleman, \\"'Unforgivable': local Labour MP vents fury over Grenfell Tower fire\\" Sadiq Khan called on the government to appoint commissioners to run Kensington and Chelsea council until the May 2018 council elections.Grenfell Tower fire: Sadiq Khan calls on PM to appoint commissioners BBC Edward Daffam of the Grenfell Action Group said, \\"They didn't give a stuff about us. We were the carcass and they were the vultures. North Kensington was like a goldmine, only they didn't have to dig for the gold. All they had to do was to marginalise the people who were living here, and that's what they were doing.\\"Grenfell campaigner calls for return of local assets as reparation The Guardian = Social division = Grenfell Tower is in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, one of the wealthiest local authorities in the country, containing some of the most expensive houses in the world, and with the highest gap between rich and poor anywhere in the country. Grenfell Tower was populated by poorer, mainly ethnic-minority residents. The Conservative-run council was criticised for neglecting the borough's poorer residents, and some have blamed their neglect as a cause of the fire. In 2016, the council took ¬£55 million in rent but only invested less than ¬£40 million in council housing. One journalist described the incident as an example of Britain's inequality. Data released in June 2017 by Trust for London and New Policy Institute shows large divides between rich and poor in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The analysis found that it is a borough with some very high incomes, as well as the highest average incomes in London, but there are pockets of deprivation, particularly in the north end of the borough, including the ward in which Grenfell Tower is located. The philosophical difference of providing a high standard of public housing and providing the bare minimum to house only those most in need first occurred as the Lancaster West Estate was being built. Grenfell and the finger blocks were built to Parker Morris standards; the tower provided one- and two- bedroom flats for single occupiers or families without children. The incoming Conservative government revised the standards down, using the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 to replace the mandatory Space in the Home document. = Underinvestment = After the fire, volunteer people and groups worked to help those made homeless and without possessions. The volunteers criticised council officials for doing little to coordinate these efforts. There were calls to jail those responsible for the fire. ‚ÄòJail those responsible‚Äô: how Grenfell Tower residents‚Äô grief turned to rage The Guardian Deborah Orr wrote, \\"We know that fire-safe cladding was available. The idea of being energy efficient and safe was not impossible, or even undesirable in theory. But fire-resistant cladding would have raised the cost for the whole building by an estimated ¬£5,000. That sum may be what people died for.\\"After Grenfell Tower unbridled anger won‚Äôt make our homes any safer The Guardian On 17 June 2017, MPs asked the council to describe why it had amassed ¬£274 million of reserves, after years of underspending, and had not used any of its budget surplus to increase fire safety, given that residents had issued repeated warnings about the Grenfell Tower fire risk. The council actually used the surplus to pay top-rate council taxpayers a ¬£100 rebate shortly before local elections which returned a Conservative council. After the fire, some former residents of Grenfell Tower still had rent payment taken out of their bank account for the burnt-out property by the council. Residents approved initial plans for fire resistant zinc cladding but this was later changed to cheaper aluminium cladding with combustible polyethylene core which residents did not approve, saving nearly ¬£300,000.Grenfell cladding approved by residents was swapped for cheaper version The Guardian = Neglect = The council received further criticism for their lack of support on 18 June 2017. Some families were reported to be sleeping on the floor in local centres four days after the event. A leading volunteer in the relief effort said: \\"Kensington and Chelsea are giving ¬£10 to the survivors when they go to the hotels ‚Äì a tenner ‚Äì there is money pouring in from all these amazing volunteers. We can't get access to this money.\\" London mayor Sadiq Khan said \\"years of neglect\\" by the council and successive governments were responsible for what had been a \\"preventable accident\\". There are calls for the council leader and some others to resign. Dawn Foster, contributing editor on housing for The Guardian, said that this was an \\"atrocity\\" that \\"was explicitly political\\" and \\"a symbol of the United Kingdom's deep inequality\\". =Deregulation= Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn brought this to the attention of the House; he said these \\"terrible consequences of deregulation and cutting corners\\" stemmed from a \\"disregard for working-class communities\\". Sadiq Khan, London Mayor said: \\"Those who mock health and safety, regulations and red tape need to take a hard look at the consequences of cutting these and ask themselves whether Grenfell Tower is a price worth paying.\\" Patrick Cockburn of The Independent criticised deregulation of the building industry by the government, which he described as \\"cutting red tape\\". This was contrasted with the increasing complexity of processes faced by prospective benefits claimants including those with mental health issues. Cockburn said long inquiries were not necessary to establish what went wrong. Cockburn said that \\"The Government is clearly frightened that the burned bodies in Grenfell Towers will be seen as martyrs who died because of austerity, deregulation and outsourcing.\\" Writing in The Guardian, Alan Travis argued that fire safety had been compromised since the early 2000s by moving the responsibility for fire safety checks from the fire brigade to building owners and creating mandatory competition between Local Authority Building Control and private approved inspectors. = Social murder = In his column on the disaster, Aditya Chakrabortty of The Guardian drew comparisons to the often lethal living and working conditions faced by the working classes and poor in Victorian Manchester, which Friedrich Engels characterised as social murder in his 1845 study The Condition of the Working Class in England. Chakrabortty stated that \\"those dozens of Grenfell residents didn't die: they were killed. What happened last week wasn't a 'terrible tragedy' or some other studio-sofa platitude: it was social murder . . . Over 170 years later, Britain remains a country that murders its poor.\\" The Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, John McDonnell also said that the fire amounted to social murder and that political decisions in recent decades led to it, and that those responsible should be held to account. = Poor transparency = On 29 June 2017, Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council held its first full meeting since the fire. The council had tried to exclude the press and public from the meeting, citing safety concerns. Journalists sought an injunction to force the council to let them attend, which was granted. The meeting was adjourned shortly after it began, with members of the council's cabinet saying that to proceed would be prejudicial to the forthcoming public inquiry. Sadiq Khan and Robert Atkinson, Labour group leader on the council, both called for the council's entire cabinet to resign. Atkinson described the situation as \\"an absolute fiasco\\". Khan said that it beggared belief that the council was trying to hold meetings in secret when the meeting was the first chance the council had to provide some answers and show transparency. He said that some people were asking whether or not the council was involved in a cover up. Conservative council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown resigned on 30 June 2017. = Criticism of the media = Jon Snow, a veteran television journalist, used the MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival to complain that the media was \\"comfortably with the elite, with little awareness, contact or connection with those not of the elite\\" and this lack of connection was \\"dangerous\\". He demanded \\"Why didn't any of us see the Grenfell action blog?\\" =Conservative Party survey= In November 2017, a branch of the Kensington Conservative Party caused anger by sending out a survey to local residents asking them to rate how important the Grenfell Tower fire was, alongside issues such as parking and recycling.  Fire and structural safety reviews  =United Kingdom= In the days after the fire, UK local authorities undertook reviews of fire safety in their residential tower blocks, including Brighton and Hove, Manchester, Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Swindon. Around 200 National Health Service trusts across the country were urged by NHS Improvement to check the cladding on their buildings, with particular attention being paid to those buildings housing in-patients. In London, councils affected included Brent, Camden, Hounslow, Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council, Newham, and Wandsworth. There are estimated to be about 600 high-rise blocks of flats in the UK that have similar cladding and unspecified fire safety tests have been carried out on panels sent in by councils at the Building Research Establishment in Watford, on behalf of the Department for Communities and Local Government. By 28 June 2017, 120 high- rise buildings in 37 different local authority areas were reported to have failed fire safety tests, a 100% failure rate of samples tested. Councils had been instructed to begin with those buildings that caused the most concern, and every single one of those had failed the test. The government's fire safety tests were criticised for looking only at the cladding and not the insulation behind it, which had burned rapidly in the Grenfell Tower fire; testing the insulation is left to councils and landlords. By 6 July 2017, only one of 191 samples tested had passed. It was announced that large-scale tests were to be done on a high wall, simulating a fire breaking out of a window. In August 2017, it was announced that the 52-bed trauma unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford was to close for up to twelve months due to concerns over flammable cladding on the building and other \\"serious and embedded\\" fire safety issues. On 20 September 2017, it was revealed that combustible cladding had been identified on 57 buildings across Glasgow. It was also revealed that neither residents nor the fire service had been informed of this by Glasgow City Council. Scottish Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said that he expected Glasgow City Council to inform all relevant parties. MSP Bob Doris described the development as \\"deeply concerning\\". In October 2017, it was revealed that Slough Borough Council was hiring a fire appliance to be on standby at Nova House, a tower block which was deemed to have unsafe cladding and was privately owned. The council was negotiating with the building's owners to take possession as it was in a better position to deal with the issues affecting the safety of the building. = Replacement of flammable cladding = Of 173 buildings tested, 165 have failed combustion tests conducted since the Grenfell fire. There are calls for the government to give financial assistance to councils that have to carry out expensive building renovations. Councillor Simon Blackburn, chair of the LGA's Safer and Stronger Communities Board, said:Press Association, \\"Grenfell Tower: cladding system in 111 buildings fails the latest round of tests\\", The Guardian, 2 August 2017. Leaseholders living in a tower block in Croydon have been told by a tribunal they must pay to remove Grenfell type cladding. This could lead some to financial ruin. The decision may be subject to appeal and could affect other properties where cladding failed fire tests. Steve Reed maintains faulty safety regulations were responsible for dangerous cladding being put up on many buildings and maintains the government should pay for replacement.Tower residents told to pay ¬£500,000 to replace Grenfell-style cladding The Guardian On 29 June 2018, the government revealed that there were still 470 high rise apartment blocks with inflammable cladding. This is a rise of 156 on the previous total as private sector properties have been included; it is expected to rise by a further 170 when they have all been accounted for. In March 2019, it emerged that central government provisions for local councils to take charge of privately owned buildings to ensure safe cladding were failing in approximately 90% of cases, leaving tens of thousands of households stuck in buildings with unsafe cladding. In April 2019, the Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government published figures indicating that 40,000 people in the UK, including those in 16,600 homes across 163 private residential buildings, were currently living in tower blocks wrapped in the same kind of flammable cladding as Grenfell Tower. A survey performed by the UK Cladding Action Group (UKCAG) found: many of these residents still face high bills to replace the cladding due to government funds being withheld; in some cases residents are running 24-hour fire watches; and residents' mental health in many cases has suffered. On 9 May 2019, James Brokenshire said ¬£200m would be paid by the Government to replace cladding on privately owned blocks. Problems with replacement cladding On 7 July 2018, BBC News reported that new cladding previously thought to be safe, which was to replace known flammable cladding similar to that used on Grenfell Tower, has itself failed fire safety tests in Dubai, Australia and the UK. The new cladding is composed of separate material components which individually are considered to be of \\"limited combustibility.\\" As such, the cladding as a complete system had been presumed under BS8414 standards to not be a fire risk. The discovery that this new cladding has failed fire tests undermines existing testing policy. In 2019 a fire developed at Bolton University and eyewitnesses maintained the cladding helped spread the fire. 'Grenfell United', a group of survivors and bereaved people stated, ‚ÄúIt brings back memories of Grenfell and we can‚Äôt believe that over two and a half years later this is happening. Our hearts go out to all the students affected. Hundreds of people go to bed scared every night in buildings covered with dangerous materials. When will this be treated as a national emergency? This cannot go on.‚Äù In February 2020 a survey of leaseholders from 117 housing developments by the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, a charity that supports leaseholders, 90 per cent of respondents said the government‚Äôs response to the ‚Äòcladding crisis‚Äô had been ‚Äúno help at all.‚Äù =Review of building regulations= Hanover House, a residential tower block in Sheffield, with its cladding partially removed after failing fire safety tests following the Grenfell fire Building regulations are currently under review in the light of the fire due to concerns with the rules and their enforcement. There is concern over fire safety issues with many other buildings.Grenfell Tower: Government to review building regulations BBC On 30 August 2017, the Department for Communities and Local Government published the terms of reference for the Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety. This independent review was led by Dame Judith Hackitt, who is a senior engineer and civil servant with experience as the Chair of the Health and Safety Executive. The review reported to both DCLG head, James Brokenshire (Sajid Javid at the time the report was commissioned) and Home Secretary, Sajid Javid (Amber Rudd at the time the report was commissioned). The two main aims of the review are firstly to develop improved building regulations for the future, with a focus on residential high-rise blocks, and secondly to provide reassurance to residents that their homes are safe. On 18 December 2017, Hackitt published her initial report. She described the entire building regulatory system as \\"not fit for purpose\\" and made interim recommendations for significant change. The final report was published on 17 May 2018, outlining a number of key failings and recommendations. The report did not recommend a ban on the use of combustible cladding on high rise buildings and Hackitt did say that she would support the government if it was to attempt to legislate a ban. Recommendations will be reconsidered after the conclusion of the public inquiry. The government is consulting on a possible ban on combustible materials. It is unclear if this applies only to cladding or to insulation as well.Grenfell-style cladding could be banned on tower blocks, government says The Guardian In October 2018, the government announced plans to ban flammable cladding on newly built buildings that were over the height, as well as for those of certain types such as schools, care homes and student housing. The Fire Brigades Union have argued that it should be entirely banned, and that a ban should also apply to existing buildings. Review of building materials The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) commissioned \\"whole system\\" tests, which are designed to see how different cladding systems reacted in a fire. Seven combinations were tested, and six deemed dangerous. It reported in August 2017 that there were 228 buildings in the United Kingdom cladded using these methods. The seventh, a combination of aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding with a limited flammability filling and stone-wool insulation, was deemed safe. There are no existing buildings in the UK using this combination, but it could be used to reclad all the buildings that are currently using the other combinations. These findings will be used to help revise the Building Regulations. Other tower block risks In August 2017, four 13-storey tower blocks, containing 242 flats, on the Ledbury estate in Peckham had their gas supplies cut off as a precaution. In the event of a gas explosion, they could be at risk of collapse. The four tower blocks, built between 1968 and 1970 using the same \\"large panel system\\" as Ronan Point; which partly collapsed in May 1968 after a small gas explosion in a flat knocked out a load-bearing exterior wall, causing a progressive collapse of one corner of the tower. There are fears that more tower blocks built using the same technique across the country may also be at risk.London tower blocks residents ordered out over gas safety fears The Guardian  International In Australia, authorities decided to remove similar cladding from all its tower blocks. It was stated that every tower block built in Melbourne in the previous 20 years had the cladding. In Malta, the Chamber of Engineers and the Chamber of Architects urged the Maltese Government to update the building regulations with regards to fire safety.  On 27 June 2017, an 11-storey tower block in Wuppertal, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany was evacuated after it was found that the cladding was similar to that installed on Grenfell Tower. A month after the fire at Grenfell Tower the external cladding of the newly built 433-room Hilton Hotel at Schiphol airport in The Netherlands was partly removed, over concerns of fire safety. Allegedly due to financial problems at the supplier, the material used did not meet the approved standards. Additional to the replacement, an external video system was installed specifically to detect fires. Also a university building in Rotterdam was found to have the same cladding and was subsequently closed and refurbished. 'Dozens' of other buildings in The Netherlands allegedly suffer the same defects. In response to Grenfell Tower and similar high-rise fires in the Middle East involving exterior cladding, the United Arab Emirates updated its Fire and Life Safety Code in 2018 to mandate the use of the NFPA 285 fire safety test. Investigations Campaign banner for local community group 'Justice4Grenfell' The local borough pledged to carry out a full investigation into the fire. Prime Minister Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, saying that people \\"deserve answers\\" to why the fire was able to spread as quickly as it did. In July 2017, the government offered an amnesty to those who had been illegally sub-letting and a one-year immigration amnesty to those who came forward with information, though did not offer a full guarantee against deportation. On 31 August 2017 Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis announced that the deadline to register for the one- year immigration amnesty for displaced undocumented residents of Grenfell Tower was to be extended by three months to 30 November 2017. Sir Martin Moore-Bick (who leads the public inquiry) wrote to the Prime Minister asking her to consider the long term future for these residents beyond their value as witnesses for the inquiry. These views were echoed by campaign groups BMELawyers4Grenfell and Justice4Grenfell. On 16 September 2019 it was reported that London Fire Brigade as a body have been interviewed by Metropolitan Police under caution in respect of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. In a press statement, LFB Commissioner Dany Cotton said the Brigade had been subject to police investigation from just after the fire; hundreds of officers had given voluntary police interviews; and LFB would continue to assist investigators. Leilani Farha argued that the failings of Grenfell Tower were a breach of residents' human rights, because they were not sufficiently involved in the way the building was developed, notably safety issues, before the fire and are not sufficiently involved in the investigations after the fire.UK may have breached human rights over Grenfell Tower, says UN The Guardian = Criminal = On 15 June 2017, Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy announced that a criminal investigation had been opened to establish if there was any case for charges to be brought. On 27 July 2017 Police issued a public notice to residents saying that they had \\"reasonable grounds\\" to suspect that both the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation \\"may have committed\\" corporate manslaughter. Senior representatives of both organisations are likely to face police interviews under caution. More than sixty companies and organisations are associated with Grenfell Tower, and police are keeping open all options for a range of possible charges. These include manslaughter, corporate manslaughter, misconduct in public office and fire safety offences. In an interview with the London Evening Standard on 7 August 2017, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, said investigations are at an early stage and nothing is ruled out. Mrs Saunders said it was more important to build strong cases than to rush to court, and that the DPP had yet to see the evidence. Health and safety legislation and other criminal laws will be considered. If proven, the offence of Gross Negligence Manslaughter carries a maximum life sentence, with a guideline minimum of twelve years. Grenfell fire: criminal charges with long prison terms not ruled out The Guardian For such a charge the prosecution must show sufficient evidence to pass a four stage \\"Adomako Test\\" proving a reprehensible breach of duty of care which caused or contributed to the victims' death. On 7 June 2018, BBC News reported that the Met Police are investigating the London Fire Brigade for using the \\"Stay Put\\" policy. Possible criminal offences under the Health and Safety at Work Act are under consideration. , thirteen interviews had been held under caution with more expected, and 7,100 statements had been taken from witnesses, family members, emergency service personnel and others. In March 2019, it was revealed that no criminal charges are due to be brought before late 2021. The Metropolitan Police explained that all evidence had to be considered before a case could be put before the Crown Prosecution Service. Phase 2 of the public enquiry is unlikely to start before 2020, and no case can be brought until after the report has been published. Fraudulent claims On 19 September 2017, Commander Stuart Cundy briefed that eight people were being investigated for allegedly making false claims to financial support in the name of fictitious victims. By 1 June 2018, five people had been convicted for fraud offences after stating they were victims of the fire to claim financial support. New arrests were made in London on 7 June 2018 of a further nine people suspected of fraud. Four were charged a day later. Three people were charged with fraud while one additional suspect was initially charged with drug and theft offences but was eventually charged with fraud on 19 July. The other five were released under investigation. By March 2020, twenty one people had been charged with fraud offences relating to the fire, with all of them being found guilty after twenty investigations by the Metropolitan Police and one investigation by the City of London Police Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department. They were given prison sentences totaling almost 90 years in total after fraudulently claiming around ¬£1 million in pre-paid credit cards, hotel accommodation costs and other funds intended for the victims of the fire. All of those convicted of fraud stated that they lived in the tower block and that their homes had been destroyed, and many said that members of their family had been killed. They spent their money on lavish holidays, expensive cars and gambling, and some even asked for more money after complaining about the food and WiFi in the hotels they were being housed in. Three of those convicted were also found to have been illegal immigrants living in the UK, and one man was caught with quantities of illegal drugs in his hotel room. Another man was also found to have committed a burglary. A woman who pretended to be a Grenfell victim was found to have made more than fifty false claims to insurers and to have also said she was present at the Manchester Arena bombing and the London Bridge attack just weeks earlier. = Forensic search and recovery = View of the lift and hoist system installed on the east face of the tower to remove debris from the tower Detailed investigations into the causes and possible criminal charges of manslaughter or breach of regulations are in progress. Search dogs, fingertip searches, DNA matching, fingerprinting, forensic dentistry and forensic anthropologists have been used. An external lift was fitted to the building to improve access. The scale of the search and recovery operation was challenging. Human remains were mixed within an estimated of debris on every floor. Time and care was taken to maintain a judicial standard and avoid mistaken identity, which could have caused further distress to surviving relatives. Disaster Victim Identification was expected by police to continue to 2018. = Fire brigade = Following the Newsnight report of 7 July 2017, the LFB said issues encountered in its response to the fire would also form part of the police investigation. LFB Commissioner Dany Cotton said in a Channel 4 News interview on 11 July 2017 that she expected reasonable criticism of the LFB response in the investigation and public inquiry. Following criticism by surivors and victims families, Cotton retired early at the end of December 2019. Her replacement from 1 January 2020 is Deputy Commissioner Andrew Roe. BBC Radio 4 reported on 16 August 2017 that the Fire Brigade was advised by KCTMO during the refurbishment and fire officers had been shown \\"fire safety features\\". Council opposition leader Robert Atkinson, structural engineer Paul Follows and building inspector Geoff Wilkinson all expressed shock that the fire had happened given prior consultation with LFB. London Fire Brigade said it had not given approval for the work, saying its legal powers are limited. It said firefighters regularly visit buildings to gain familiarity with the layout and equipment, but that this was not the same as a detailed inspection. =Public inquiry= Public hearings opened 14 September 2017 One day after the fire broke out, Prime Minister Theresa May announced a public inquiry into the causes of the fire. Two weeks later, Sir Martin Moore-Bick was appointed to lead it. He pledged that the inquiry would be \\"open, transparent and fair\\". The inquiry will run alongside the criminal investigations. On 15 August 2017, Theresa May announced the terms of reference, accepting in full Moore-Bick's proposals. The inquiry plans to examine the cause and spread of the fire, the adequacy and enforcement of building regulations and fire protection measures, the actions of the council and KCTMO prior to the fire, and the responses of the London Fire Brigade, council and national government. Labour Party politicians and some survivors called for the inquiry to include a broader examination of national social housing policy, which was not included in the terms of reference. The Inquiry's public hearings started on 14 September 2017. The first report (Phase 1) from the inquiry was officially published on 30 October 2019, but had been leaked and publicised during the press embargo.Grenfell inquiry accused of focusing on junior firefighters The Guardian, 2019 Originally due in spring 2019, the date was pushed back to October. Moore-Bick told survivors the timing disappointed him.Grenfell survivors fear inquiry judge will side with establishment The Guardian Moore-Bick's report affirmed the exterior cladding was the primary reason the fire spread out of control, and that it did not comply with the building regulations. He praised the \\"courage and devotion to duty\\" of the firefighters but argued LFB suffered from \\"significant systemic failings\\" and that incident commanders were not trained to deal with a failure of compartmentalisation of this scale. The report was welcomed by survivors. On 6 December, Dany Cotton announced she would retire earlier than planned. This followed calls from bereaved families and survivors of the disaster for her to quit. The inquiry resumed with Phase 2 on 28 January 2020. =Equality and Human Rights Commission report= The Equality and Human Rights Commission examined the response to the fire and found that authorities failed to put children‚Äôs best interests at the heart of their efforts, in breach of international obligations. It identified a lack of co- ordination among services, both in the immediate aftermath and a year later. The Following Grenfell report (March 2019) observes that children who witnessed the fire, or who have lost a friend or part of their family, don't know where or how to access help because the services are not available. There are issues about the adequacy of training needed for public sector and other service providers to carry out their duties under the Equalities Act. The EHRC report expressed particular concern around the placing of disabled people, including wheelchair users, on upper storeys of tower blocks without any consideration about how they could escape in a fire or other emergency. The report considered disabled people had faced discriminatory treatment amounting to breaches of the right to life, the right to safe, adequate housing; and the right to freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, further noting that degrading treatment continued after the fire with disabled people being housed in inaccessible premises. = Civil lawsuit = On 11 June 2019, survivors and families of the victims of the fire filed a civil action complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia against Arconic and Celotex (both of which are headquartered in Pennsylvania), seeking an unspecified amount of money damages for various product liability claims. The 420-page complaint alleges that the cladding and insulation were defective because they lacked fire retardant and were therefore combustible. Whirlpool, the Michigan-based manufacturer of the Hotpoint refrigerator believed to have caused the fire, was also named as a defendant in the suit on the grounds that the refrigerator contained materials liable to catch fire. Litigation is expected to take at least two and a half years due to the long process of discovery. By August, the defendants had exercised their right to remove the case to the appropriate federal court: the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In November 2019, Arconic resisted production of documents (already in the possession of its American lawyers at DLA Piper) on the basis that the cladding at issue had been manufactured by a French subsidiary, Arconic Architectural Products SAS, and that French law prohibits the production of commercial information in foreign legal proceedings without authorization by a French court. According to its US corporate filings, as of November 2019, Arconic had already spent approximately ¬£30 million on lawyers and advisers to respond to all the criminal and civil investigations, inquiries, and litigation arising out of the fire.  Demolition  Grenfell Tower partially covered in scaffolding and the protective wrap in May 2018 Grenfell Tower site manager Michael Lockwood told a public meeting on 26 July 2017 that the building would be covered in a protective wrap supported by scaffolding. This is to protect forensic evidence but would later allow the building to be taken down. The community will be consulted on how the space should be used after demolition. As of September 2018, deconstruction is expected by 2022.

Her work Victory Ball, on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is currently on display as part of Landmarks, the public art program of The University of Texas at Austin. Biography Weschler was a native of New York City, the daughter of J. Charles and Hulda Mayer Weschler. She first studied at the Horace Mann School before going on to the Parsons School of Design, the Art Students League of New York, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Her instructors included William Zorach and Albert Laessle. She married Herbert E. Solomon in 1928 and with him lived at Long Hill, a house in Erwinna, Pennsylvania. She retained an apartment in New York City to which she relocated permanently in the early 1980s. Solomon died in 1995; Weschler died at her Waverly Place apartment five years later, leaving a nephew and his family as her survivors. Weschler came to sculpture almost accidentally, having previously studied fashion design, interior decoration, and painting. Beginning in the 1950s she turned again to painting, using plastic resins and synthetic glazes to produce colorful works. Her work Victory Ball, on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is currently on display as part of Landmarks, the public art program of The University of Texas at Austin. Active in the Federal Arts Project, she produced a relief in terra cotta, Early Days at Elkin, for the Elkin, North Carolina post office in 1939. Her 1951 sculpture Victory Ball, in cast stone, is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A bronze bust of William Zorach is owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The Humanist, an early use of fiberglass as sculptural material, was owned by Warren Allen Smith, later becoming the property of the Institute for Humanist Studies. Other pieces are in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and Yale University. Weschler was a founding member of the Sculptors Guild and was a member of the National Association of Women Artists and the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors. She was active as a writer, producing work for numerous art journals and publishing a book of poetry, Nightshade, in 1931. Her papers are held at Syracuse University.

Family  His complete name, Publius Manilius Vopiscus Vicinillianus Lucius Elufrius Julius Quadratus Bassus, is polyonymous; the shorter version of his name that appears in consular dates is Publius Manilius Vopiscus.Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 138 An inscription recovered from Tibur shows that his father's praenomen was Publius. The dedicators of this inscription, N. Prosius Platanus and his wife Minilia Eutychia (probably a freedwoman of Vopiscus) named their children Vicinilla, Vopiscianus and Atticus, and notes \\"obviously the parents had the consul in mind when naming two of their children.\\"Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature, p. 139 The poet Statius in his Silvae provides a lengthy description of a villa owned by one Manilius Vospiscus, aside the Anio River and sheltered by two rocky outcrops.Silvae, I.3 It is uncertain if the villa owner is the same person as the consul of 114: Ronald Syme notes there was a suffect consul in the year 60 named Marcus Manilius Vospiscus, and because Statius' wish for a long life might not fit a man already elderly at the time Statius wrote his poem, Syme then suggests the consul's father Publius.Syme, \\"Spaniards at Tivoli\\", Ancient Society, 13/14 (1982/1983), p. 246 Some scholars have suggested that Vopiscus had been adopted by Gaius Julius Quadratus Bassus, consul of 105, but in his monograph on naming practices in the Early Roman Empire, Olli Salomies points out \\"the order of the names rules this out\\". He is equally doubtful about the connection with Lucius Elufrius Severus, proconsul of Crete and Cyrenaica in 100. However, Ronald Syme notes \\"Elufrius\\" is a very rare family name: \\"No specimens from any province, and in Italy confined to a narrow region of Umbria.\\"Syme, \\"Spaniards\\", p. 247 \\"Multiple names are not always the product of ancestry or adoption\\", Syme asserts. \\"Advertising social success or aspirations, they may commemorate amity or a benefactor without any close tie of propinquity.\\" He points out that Vopiscus, as explained below, was military tribune in Syria at the same time Quadratus Bassus was governor, which strengthens the possibility of some kind of connection.  Career  The inscription from Tibur provides the details of a likely patrician career, although some offices are presented out of order. Vopiscus began his career in his teenage years as one of the tresviri monetalis, which was the most prestigious of the four boards comprising the vigintiviri it was usually held either by patricians or favored plebeiansAnthony Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), pp. 4f about the same time he was admitted into the Salii Collinus. According to the order of the inscription, Vopiscus was a military tribune in Legio IV Scythica before he was a quaestor in attendance to the emperor Trajan; this order is unusual, for, by this point in history, serving as a military tribune almost always came after the office of quaestor.Birley, Fasti of Roman Britain, p. 14 After his term as praetor, Vopiscus was admitted as flamen, then was co-opted into the College of Pontiffs. He served as a curator fani Herculis Victoris fuit Tibure before acceding to the consulship. Vopiscus' career after the consulate and the date of his death are unknown.

Their quota contributes an estimated SDR of 1,153 millions and voting power of 0.24%. As of August 2016, the current IMF Resident Representative to Vietnam is Jonathan Dunn. Following the events of the Vietnam War, most trade and financial relations between Vietnam and foreign entities was severely restricted. The Soviet Union remained one of the few nations with continued contact with the financial institutions in Vietnam. After the Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia in 1989, Japan was among the first to express a desire to resume financial aid relations with Vietnam. Japan and France endeavored to reestablish Vietnam's involvement in the IMF but were met with resistance from the United States who were seeking to use the restrictions to the pressure the nation to cooperate in establishing the whereabouts of missing US military service members. Informal contact between the IMF and Vietnam was reestablished in the later part of the 1980s. The US voted down most efforts to establish continued relations and financial assistance from the IMF to Vietnam until the early 1990s. A preliminary formal agreement for financial support was not reached until October 1993 and codified in a full agreement a year after that. So far they have taken about two ECF type loans, one on April 13, 2001, which estimated 290 SDR million, and the other on November 11, 1994, which had reached about 145 SDR million. In 1998, Vietnam was in slow recovery of its economy after the Southeast Asia Economic Crisis. As a member of ASEAN, their best solution was to heavily rely on loans from the IMF. In 1999, IMF warned that the federal direct investment into Vietnam was too concentrated in the \\"import substituting and non- tradable\\" sectors like construction and telecommunication as opposed to investment in exportable goods and services. In 2001, Vietnam sent a letter of intent to the IMF to receive a loan to fund the Poverty Reductions and Growth Funds arrangement. In order to create a greater macroeconomic stability for Vietnam they would rely on the monetary policy while under shock scenarios as it has proven to lift off interest rates. According to IMF records, Vietnam is still paying that loan and continues their membership with the IMF. Since 2012, the Vietnamese dong closely tied to the U.S. dollar. Every year or two Vietnam undergoes a cycle staff report based on Article IV Consultation and hold discussions of their economic developments. As of July 2016, Vietnam has found some promising progress as they have decreased their poverty rate by one percent and managed to lower their inflation. Their main source of exports are crude oil, electronics, coffee, rice, and rubber, while their key export buyers are the US, Japan, and the developing members of ASEAN. As of July 2017, IMF credits Vietnam's economy with \\"growth momentum [that] remains robust underpinned by strong manufacturing activity and foreign direct investment.\\" In an earlier April 2017 report, the IMF had warned that countries with significant amount of exports to the US have seen \\"relatively weak\\" share prices.

The film was released on 26 June 2017. It was produced by Nida Yasir and Hassan Zia under the YNH Films production company and is distributed by Eveready Pictures and Urdu 1 Pictures. The film stars Danish Taimoor and Sana Javed. Reviews of the film were mixed. While some felt it was a colourful guilt-free family film released for Eid al-Fitr, others felt that there were too many dirty jokes and that better writing and direction could have helped convey its simple message of community stewardship. Plot Ali, a young Pakistani, returns from China to Karachi with gifts for his family and friends. He is in love with his childhood crush Mehru, the daughter of his father's friend, and a marriage alliance is made between their families. Meanwhile, Marzi, a local transgender don, seeks to buy out the neighbourhood in a scheme with a politician to profit from anticipated Chinese development in the area. Newlyweds Ali and Mehru are unable to conceive a child. A doctor suggests that stress could be the reason, as Mehru has been unable to adjust to the city squalor and fears crime. Ali decides to let her stay at her father's home in the country, while deciding to improve his neighbourhood by changing the attitudes of its residents. With his trusted friend Jani, Ali sets to convincing the community to improve their neighbourhood. Some are resistant but early progress convinces them to keep the roads and buildings clean, if only as a facade. Mehru realizes that Ali's neighbours are good people, and the revitalization leads to a news telecast of economic growth and financial stability. Desperate to gain control of the block, Marzi rents an apartment and tries to create trouble with his goons. The politician kidnaps Mehru and demands crore (30 million rupees) ransom from Ali. To raise the money, his neighbours sell their apartments to Marzi for a mere lakhs (1 million rupees). Realizing the scheme, Ali and his friends rescue Mehru while the politician is holding a press conference, and expose his misdeeds to the media. Some time later, Ali and Mehru welcome their baby to a safe and clean neighbourhood.

The tower was completed in 1974 as part of the first phase of the Lancaster West Estate. The tower was named after Grenfell Road, which ran to the south of the building; the road itself was named after Field Marshal Lord Grenfell, a senior British Army officer. The building's top 20 storeys consisted of 120 flats, with six per floor ‚Äì two flats with one bedroom each and four flats with two bedrooms each ‚Äì with a total of 200 bedrooms. Its first four storeys were non-residential until its most recent refurbishment, from 2015 to 2016, when two of them were converted to residential use, bringing it up to 127 flats and 227 bedrooms; six of the new flats had four bedrooms each and one flat had three bedrooms. It also received new windows and new cladding with thermal insulation during this refurbishment.Grenfell Tower regeneration Project Prior to a fire, which began in the early hours of 14 June 2017, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and central UK government bodies \\"knew, or ought to have known\\", that their management of the tower was breaching the rights to life, and to adequate housing, of the tower's residents, according to a later enquiry by the government's own equalities watchdog. The fire gutted the building and killed 72 people, including a stillbirth. In early 2018, it was announced that, following demolition of the tower, the site will likely become a memorial to those killed in the fire. Description left The 24-storey tower block was designed in 1967 in the Brutalist style of the era by Clifford Wearden and Associates, with the Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council approving its construction in 1970, as part of phase one of the Lancaster West redevelopment project. The tall building contained 120 one- and two-bedroom flats (six dwellings per floor on twenty of the twenty-four storeys with the bottom four, the podium, being used for non-residential purposes). The floors were named ground, mezzanine, walkway and walkway+1, floor 1, floor 2 etc. It housed up to 600 people. The tower was built to the Parker Morris standards. Each floor was 22 m square, giving an approximate usable area of . The layout of each floor was designed to be flexible as none of the partition walls were structural. The residential floors contained a two bedroom flat at each corner, in between which on the east and the west face was a one bedroomed flat. The core contained a stair column and the lift and service shafts. One- bedroom flats were in area and two-bedroom flats were . The building was innovative, as most LCC tower blocks used traditional brick work for infill whereas here precast insulated concrete blocks were used, giving the walls an unusual texture. The ten exterior concrete columns were also unusual. In addition, other tower blocks of this era had four flats per storey, rather than six. The original lead architect for the building, Nigel Whitbread, said in 2016 in an interview with Constantine Gras, which was later partially repeated in The Guardian, that the tower had been designed with attention to strength, following the Ronan Point collapse of 1968, \\"and from what I can see could last another 100 years.\\" He described it as a \\"very simple and straightforward concept. You have a central core containing the lift, staircase and the vertical risers for the services and then you have external perimeter columns. The services are connected to the central boiler and pump which powered the whole development and this is located in the basement of the tower block. This basement is approximately four metres deep and in addition has two metres of concrete at its base. This foundation holds up the tower block and in situ concrete columns and slabs and pre-cast beams all tie the building together\\". History Construction, by contractors A E Symes, of Leyton, London, commenced in 1972, with the building being completed in 1974. Before construction the plans at basement level were changed from the original brief to accommodate the need for extra car-parking. In the early 1990s, access to the building was restricted through the use of key fobs, and lift access to the first four storeys was discontinued. The building was renovated in 2015‚Äì16. When the building opened in 1974, it was nicknamed the 'Moroccan Tower' because many renters came from the local Moroccan immigrant community. In recent years some residents had become leaseholders, mostly under the Right to Buy scheme; 14 flats in the tower, and three in Grenfell Walk, were leaseholder owned at the time of the 2017 fire. =Renovation= The renovation was part of a project to utilise the area around Lancaster Green. A new leisure centre had already been built to the east of the green, and the all-weather football pitches to the north of the tower were destined to become Kensington Academy. The renovation aimed to replace the substandard heating system, replace the windows, increase the thermal efficiency of the tower and improve appearance of the tower in the style of the academy. It aimed to reconfigure the podium levels in order to use the space more efficiently. The nursery would move from on the mezzanine floor to on the ground floor with immediate access to outside play space. The mezzanine floor would be continued across the full width of the building making space for three four-bedroom, six person flats. The Dale Youth boxing club gained almost extra space by moving from the ground floor to the walkway level ( to ). Walkway + 1 level would be converted from offices, to four new four bedroom, 6 person flats. Plans by Studio E Architects for renovation of the tower were publicised in 2012. The ¬£8.7 million refurbishment, undertaken by Rydon Ltd, of Forest Row, East Sussex in conjunction with Artelia for contract administration and Max Fordham as specialist mechanical and electrical consultants, was completed in 2016. As part of the project, in 2015‚Äì2016, the concrete structure received new windows and new aluminium composite rainscreen cladding, in part to improve the appearance of the building. Two types were used: Arconic's Reynobond PE, which consists of two coil-coated aluminium sheets that are fusion bonded to both sides of a polyethylene core; and Reynolux aluminium sheets. Beneath these, and fixed to the outside of the walls of the flats, was Celotex RS5000 polyisocyanurate (PIR) thermal insulation. The work was carried out by Harley Facades of Crowborough, East Sussex, at a cost of ¬£2.6 million. =Fire= alt= A fire broke out on 14 June 2017, which killed 72 of Grenfell's residents. Emergency services received the first report of the fire at 00:54 local time. It burned for around 24hours. Initially hundreds of firefighters and 45 fire engines were involved in efforts to control the fire, with many firefighters continuing to attempt to control pockets of fire on the higher floors after most of the rest of the building had been gutted. Residents of surrounding buildings were evacuated due to concerns that the tower could collapse, though the building was later determined to be structurally sound. =Fate= The charred remains of the building, June 2017 The tower in May 2018, partially covered in scaffolding and protective wrap After the fire, the exterior was covered in a protective wrap to assist the outstanding forensic investigations. The Government, the Kensington and Chelsea Council, and the Grenfell United survivors' group, have agreed that at the conclusion of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry the demolished tower will be replaced by a memorial to the victims. The government has voiced its intention to allow the survivors to \\"...guide the way future decisions are made\\" about the tower site and memorial. Deconstruction is expected to be completed by 2022. Architect Nigel Whitbread was the lead architect for the Grenfell Tower. In an interview with Constantine Gras, quoted in The Guardian, he said that \\"he was born in Kenton, his parents had a grocers shop on St Helen's Gardens, North Kensington. He was educated at Sloane Grammar school and then got a position with the architects Douglas Stephen and Partners, who though small were applying the principles of Le Corbusier and the modernists.\\" He worked alongside Kenneth Frampton who was the Technical Editor of the journal Architectural Design; and Elia Zenghelis and Bob Maxwell. He moved to work for Clifford Wearden after the basic plan for Lancaster West Estate had been established. He later worked for 30 years until his retirement at Aukett Associates. Around 2016 he became involved with local residents association drawing up the St Quintin and Woodlands Neighbourhood Plan. Grenfell Action Group A residents' organisation, Grenfell Action Group (GAG), published a blog in which it highlighted major safety problems. In the four years preceding the fire, they published 10 warnings criticising fire safety and maintenance practices at Grenfell Tower. *In 2013, the group published a 2012 fire risk assessment done by a tenant management organisation (TMO) Health and Safety Officer which recorded safety concerns. Firefighting equipment at the tower had not been checked for up to four years; on-site fire extinguishers had expired, and some had the word \\"condemned\\" written on them because they were so old. GAG documented its attempts to contact Kensington and Chelsea TMO (KCTMO) management; they also alerted the council Cabinet Member for Housing and Property but said they never received a reply from him or his deputy. *In July 2013, the council threatened the group's blogger with legal action, accusing them of \\"defamatory behaviour\\" and \\"harassment\\". *In January 2016, GAG warned that people might be trapped in the building if a fire broke out, pointing out that the building had only one entrance and exit, and corridors that were allowed to fill with rubbish, such as old mattresses. GAG published an online article attacking KCTMO as an \\"evil, unprincipled, mini-mafia\\" and accusing the council of ignoring health and safety laws. In the blog post, they warned that \\"only a catastrophic event\\" would \\"expose the ineptitude and incompetence of [KCTMO]\\" and \\"bring an end to the dangerous living conditions and neglect of health and safety legislation\\" at the building, adding, \\"[We] predict that it won't be long before the words of this blog come back to haunt the KCTMO management and we will do everything in our power to ensure that those in authority know how long and how appallingly our landlord has ignored their responsibility to ensure the health and safety of their tenants and leaseholders.

There's not much here that relates to tradition, and this vein of jazz is inextricably bound to tradition.

It was built in 1917 as a practice and performing space for a community band. Later it served as a general event venue for its rural township. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995 for having local significance in the themes of performing arts and social history. It was nominated for being a rare surviving example of a community band hall, and for its long service as the township's social and political center. Description Germania Hall is a simple one-story, wood- frame building with a gable roof. Its footprint measures . It stands on a poured concrete foundation and has shiplap siding. The main entry is a single door centered on the western fa√ßade. The interior is a single room with a stage at the eastern end raised about above the hardwood floor. The Germania Cornet Band Around 1915, 20 area residents formed a brass band. This was a common hobby in the United States from the mid-19th century through about 1920. The instruments were easy to learn and demand for performances was high, as virtually any public gathering from fairs to grand opening ceremonies to funerals was considered incomplete without a brass band. The majority of the members of the newly formed Germania Cornet Band lived and worked on farms within three miles of each other. They were mostly young, American-born sons of Swedish and Norwegian immigrants who had come to the United States in the 1880s. However the oldest band member, 43-year-old Gustaf Peterson, had himself left Sweden in 1892 and settled in Germania Township in 1903. Several band members were siblings, and at least two were just 13 years old. As founding member Carl Peterson later recalled, \\"none of us had ever played an instrument‚Äîwe didn't even know how to read notes, but we thought it would be fun to have a band.\\" The group hired \\"Professor\\" George Mundy of nearby Eagle Bend, Minnesota, to be their band director, paying him $5 () per practice session. Mundy helped them order their instruments‚Äîbrass bands were so common that package deals of all necessary instruments plus sheet music were available by mail-order from several companies. Peterson went on: \\"It was a great day when our instruments arrived‚Äîeveryone tried to blow the horns, beat the drums, etc.\\" An early photograph of the Germania Cornet Band shows members wielding five types of horn, three types of trumpet, three clarinets, one trombone, a snare drum, and a bass drum. Almost as important as instruments were a band's uniforms‚Äîthe Germania Band's outfits were black with gold braid and the initials \\"G.B.\\" stitched on the collar. The band performed at concerts and barn dances in the area. Their repertoire consisted of locally popular music: a mix of polkas, waltzes, two-steps, and some Nordic folk music. The bandmembers took no money individually, pooling their earnings to pay their instructor Mundy. In the summer of 1916 they performed twice in the barn of member Sigvard Bjerken's family. That December they gave a concert at the opera house in nearby Clarissa, Minnesota. Initially the band had been practicing in a vacant building, but by March 1917 they had earned enough to commission their own band hall. Bjerken's parents gave them a free 20-year lease on an acre at the edge of their farm. The band paid Clarissa resident John Johnson $150 () to design and build a suitable space, and they assisted him in the labor. The band hall was dedicated on September 23, 1917, in a ceremony that included orators, a picnic dinner, performances by the Germania Cornet Band and a few other bands, and a \\"loyalty demonstration\\" intended to counteract growing discrimination against immigrant communities as the United States entered World War I. The following month, band director George Mundy‚Äîwho had also helped found the Clarissa High School Band‚Äîmoved away to Pelican Rapids, Minnesota, to start a new musical group there. The Germania Cornet Band was able to continue without him, holding practices, concerts, and dances at their new hall and performing at numerous community events. They also opened up the hall to others. In September 1918 it was the site of a dance benefitting the Red Cross and a locally produced play. Other area bands performed there and dances were scheduled regularly. The township board began using the hall for meetings and elections. During Prohibition, the organizer of the regular Saturday night dances alerted the county sheriff to troublemakers getting drunk on moonshine, resulting in a January 1925 raid that landed seven young men in jail. The Clarissa Independent proudly reported that all but two of them were \\"outsiders\\" from Bartlett Township and Aldrich, Minnesota. Community use The Germania Cornet Band folded in the early 1920s. Around the nation, the heyday of the community brass band was drawing to a close as phonographs, movies, and radio provided new ways to hear music, and the advent of cars, telephones, and better roads reduced the isolation of rural communities. However these same factors eased the creation of rural community clubs, and the newly formed Germania Community Club took on a key role in local social life. Throughout the 1930s the club sponsored educational lectures, talent shows, and spelling bees at the hall. They also organized a popular annual picnic that typically included music, dancing, speeches, food concessions, and sporting contests such as races, horseshoes, wrestling, boxing, tug-of-war, and baseball. In 1950 the hall was donated to the Germania Community Club and they purchased its lot for $50 (). A 1968 newspaper article noted that the hall was still regularly used by 4-H and other groups for athletic practices and events, school programs, talent shows, township meetings, and elections.

Note its warehouse-like appearance that is not typical of a traditional restaurant. A ghost restaurant is a food service business that serves customers exclusively by delivery based on phone orders or online food ordering. By not having a full-service restaurant premise with a storefront and dining room, ghost restaurants can economize by occupying cheaper real estate. Although restaurants typically earn more from customers who dine at a restaurant, due to the money saved by not having a dining room and not hiring waitstaff, ghost restaurants have significantly lower overhead (even taking into account the expense of operating a delivery service or the fees charged by third party delivery companies like Grubhub and Caviar) and thus higher profit margins. Operating a dining room, with the real estate it requires, staff, amenities, insurance, and other expenses, entails a significant cost. Even restaurants with considerable to-go (British: takeaway) business traditionally dedicate the majority of their space to seating. As visibility, curb appeal, foot traffic, and accessibility are not concerns, the kitchen can be housed in an inexpensive location that would not typically be considered desirable for a restaurant. City councils in the UK have expressed concerns about expansion because residents have complained about noise from delivery traffic. A typical ghost restaurant location is able to accommodate the preparation of several different types of cuisines. Green Summit Group, for instance, operates several restaurant concepts from a single location. Without a brick-and-mortar dining location to renovate, front-of-house staff, and paper menus to reprint, companies can also try out new brands and cuisines with less effort and expense. The strategy of having multiple brands and cuisines can target a broader range of customers. Most of the restaurants use existing third party delivery services. For example, Green Summit, which owns several ghost restaurants in Chicago and New York City and partners with Grubhub. Keatz operates kitchens in Europe. Some companies incorporate their own delivery system into the business model, as was the case with the now defunct New York- based company Maple. Maple, which was partly backed by restaurateur David Chang, oriented its business around productivity in terms of meals per hour per kitchen  a metric more typical of fast food restaurants. Finding the correct business model seems to be a challenge  Maple ceased operations in May 2017 and sold to the UK food-delivery company, Deliveroo. Ando, the delivery-only restaurant launched in 2016, also a David Chang venture, closed doors in January 2018 and was sold to Uber Eats. Ghost restaurants have been criticized for their unpleasant working conditions and cramped, windowless kitchen spaces. Several 2015 news articles found some \\"ghost restaurants\\" operated as unregulated, unlicensed standalone entities or as \\"fronts\\" for restaurants that might or might not have health code violations. Terminology A ghost restaurant may also be called a delivery-only restaurant, or online-only restaurant. A ghost restaurant may be called a dark kitchen (or other variant names, referring to \\"ghost kitchens\\"); however, a ghost restaurant differs from a ghost kitchen in that a ghost kitchen is not necessarily a restaurant brand in itself and may contain kitchen space and facilities for more than one restaurant brand. Types By creating a ghost restaurant, a virtual restaurant brand is created. There are three ways a ghost kitchen and virtual brand can be created. = Independent ghost kitchen owner = An individual can set up a ghost kitchen to start their own brand, which is identified with their own online restaurant. One might choose to start up a ghost kitchen because setup costs are lower, and the time taken is shorter, than for a kitchen that also serves a walk-in restaurant. It might take only 3 or 4 weeks. = Existing restaurants = Existing restaurants can opt to start a ghost restaurant next to their existing restaurant. In this case the restaurant provides food from their kitchen for a different brand name. A Mexican burrito restaurant could prepare pizzas as well, and sell these online under another brand. However, they do not sell these dishes in their physical restaurant. This is a way to attract consumers in the search for pizza and targeting customers without making them skeptical about the pizzas having been made in a Mexican burrito kitchen. Another advantage of this strategy is that it makes testing out new dishes or menus easier because only a change in the online menu is needed to trial a new dish. Eventually, if the pizza sales were successful, the Mexican burrito restaurant could add them to the menu of their physical restaurant. Moreover, setting up a virtual brand does not require many major additional capital costs for an existing restaurant. They already have the kitchen space and the staff to prepare the food. They do not need a lengthy time to set up the new brand, as many of the elements needed for the kitchen aspects of the ghost restaurant are available. The additional costs of adding a virtual brand are developing the concept for the brand, the online menu, website, and ordering and delivery system (some of these elements, such as ordering and delivery systems, can be tasked to contracted to third parties). Some new cuisines may require new cooking equipment, such as steamers, cookers, or ovens. = Delivery platforms = Another way a ghost kitchen can arise is through delivery platforms such as UberEats and Deliveroo. UberEats set up dark kitchens to prepare meals that are only available on their food ordering platform. These kitchens prepare a variety of dishes. To differentiate the multiple types of dishes and cuisines, they created different brand names. Brooklyn Burger Factory, MIA Wings and French tacos are all brands created for UberEats which are only available on the UberEats application. This exclusivity can convince customers to choose their particular application, as the food is solely available on the UberEats platform.

He was deposed from this title and exiled by American Governor Edward Stanley Kellogg because the idea of monarchy was incompatible with the Constitution of the United States. Biography Map of the Manu'a islands. His parents were Arthur Pa ªu Young and of Amipelia or Amepelia. His father's heritage was half-Samoan and half-white; his grandfather was either a British or American surnamed Young and his grandmother was a Samoan woman of Fasito'o (located in the western Samoan Islands). On his mother's side, Young was a descendant of Tui Manu'a Taliutafa Tupolo, son of Tui Manu'a Moaatoa, of the anoalo class, the lineal descendants of the Tui Manu'a line. His elder sister Tui Manu'a Matelita ruled briefly from 1891 to 1895. The family resided in the main two villages of 'o LumƒÅ and Sƒ´'ufaga, on Ta‚Äò≈´, the main island of the Manu'a group, where his father was a trader. The family lived in a two-story stone house in the center of the two villages near the Protestant Christian church. The family also had connections and lived in the western Samoan Islands at Apia (capital of German Samoa). After the short reign of his sister Matelita, the title went to Tui Manu ªa Elisala (from another branch of the family). He ceded the islands to the United States with the Treaty of Cession of Manu'a on 16 July 1904 thus becoming a part of American Samoa. After Elisala's death in 1909, it was noted that \\"the title effectively died ‚Äì at least in the eyes of the American government ‚Äì with him. But the status of the title was not forgotten and the desire for Samoa autonomy lived on.\\" Attempted restoration of the Tui Manu'a title In July 1924, a group of native high chiefs within the assembly of the faletolu and anoalo elected Chris Young to the vacant title. Before this point, he had been residing outside Samoa for seventeen years. The restoration was immediately denounced by the colonial authority in American Samoa under Governor Edward Stanley Kellogg who exiled Young and the chiefs who elected him to Pago Pago on Tutuila in order to prevent him form exercising the power of his office. The American authorities worried that the Samoans were in effect reviving a monarchy or native kingship under their jurisdiction and the ramification it would have on Samoan nationalism. Kellogg also argued that the idea was incompatible with the Constitution of the United States and Young was forbidden to keep the title or return to the island of Ta‚Äò≈´. These actions led to native protests in Manu'a. Young also received a letter from the President of the United States concurring with Kellogg's decision ending the succession of the title and stating that the United States' \\"system of government does not permit it.\\" He was eventually allowed to return to Manu'a. In 1927, Young sued and brought his case to the High Court of American Samoa. The court recognized Young's right to the title and affirmed his familial relationship to the anoalo. However, it ruled that \\"If the name Tuimanua were still in existence it is very likely that Chris Young would be legally entitled to the name Taliutafa, but as the Tuimanua has been abolished by law, the name Taliutafa should also be abolished as the perpetuation of this name can lead only to local strife and discord in Manua.\\" A minority of modern Samoans still regard Chris Young as the last Tui Manu'a, although the majority opinion is that Tui Manu'a Elisala was the last official titleholder.

It was owned and operated by Leland Louis Green who was the first registered naval architect in South Carolina.  Description  The site is situated east of Concord Street, between the intersections of Calhoun and Laurens Streets. In the late-19th century, the wharves along Concord Street were home to naval stores warehouses and Pregnall Brothers Shipyard, which was established in 1869. Pregnall Brothers closed in 1912, reopening that same year as Valk & Murdoch Iron Works. In 1919, the yard was renamed Charleston Dry Dock & Machine Co. In 1921, it was reported that the plant had an 8,500-ton floating drydock, with a 30-foot depth of water coming into the facility. The drydock was designed by Crandall Dry Dock Engineers of Massachusetts. The first entirely-welded ship in the world, the MS Carolinian, was built at the facility in 1929-1930. It was designed by R.F. Smith, and Charleston Dry Dock & Machine was the sole licensee of this design.

By December of that year Nick Barker had replaced O'Biegly on bass guitar. They issued two studio albums, Here at Pain's Insistence (August 1987) and Laying Down Law (1988), before disbanding in mid-1989. In 2008 they briefly reunited in support of a compilation album, Past Imperfect.  History  The Wreckery were formed in January 1985 in Melbourne by Robin Casinader on drums, piano, Hammond organ, guitar and violin (ex-Plays with Marionettes, Horla); Edward Clayton-Jones on guitar, organ and vocals (ex-Fabulous Marquises, Plays with Marionettes, Horla, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds); Tadeusz O'Biegly on bass guitar; Hugo Race on lead vocals and guitar (ex-Plays with Marionettes, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds) and Charles Todd on saxophone and organ (ex-Wild Dog Rodeo, Cattletruck). Mark Deming of AllMusic opined that they were \\"One of the more important bands on the Australian post-punk scene of the 1980s, Melbourne's the Wreckery played dark, atmospheric music informed by the blues and the same sort of chemical and cultural obsessions as their contemporaries Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.\\" While Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noticed they were \\"Led by the enigmatic, petulant Hugo Race, whose bleak visions stabbed at the heart of the human condition, [the group] defied conventional approaches to plough a deep furrow of dark romantic melodrama.\\" Casinader and Race had been band mates in Dum Dum Fit (1978), before forming Plays with Marionettes with Clayton-Jones. Clayton-Jones and Race with both members of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. In early April 1985 the Wreckery recorded their debut five-track mini-album, I Think This Town Is Nervous (Hot Records, December), at Melbourne's Dex Studios. Nick Barker (ex-Curse, Reptile Smile) had replaced O'Biegly on bass guitar. During 1986 the group's concerts were broadcast on ABC-TV's Edge of the Wedge and on SBS-TV's The Noise. In April of that year they recorded their second EP, Yeh My People (Rampant Records, January 1987). The EP provided their single, \\"No Shoes for This Road\\". According to McFarlane, \\"Race wrote the bulk of the band's material, although one of the standout tracks on Yeh My People was Clayton-Jones' tremulous 'Overload'.\\" Deming observed that \\"like its precursor, [it] did well on the Australian indie charts and helped the band become a frequent presence on the touring circuit.\\" The Wreckery issued their first full-length studio album, Here at Pain's Insistence, in August 1987 via Rampant Records. The group produced it with Bruce Johnson as audio engineer. Andree Coelli of The Canberra Times interviewed Todd, who explained \\"It's a good progression from the last album, the songs are probably better defined, not so much in style and music, but the songwriting is maturing. It's not the same for every track, there are some twisted songs and some not-so-twisted songs.\\" McFarlane felt it \\"was a consolidation of the band's thematic approach.\\" In November the album provided a single, \\"Everlasting Sleep\\", which McFarlane found was \\"beguiling\\". A four-track EP, Ruling Energy, appeared in February 1988, which McFarlane opined displayed \\"four more slices of moody, rough-shod R&B.;\\" The group followed with a compilation album, The Collection, in October on Rampant Records. However the label was \\"having financial problems\\" and the Wreckery signed with Citadel Records to release their second studio album, Laying Down Law, in October, which had been preceded by the single, \\"Good to Be Gone\\", in August. Deming preferred the second album, which is \\"regarded by many as the group's strongest work.\\" Barker, Clayton-Jones and Todd had all left soon after the album was recorded in early 1988. Deming noted that \\"tensions within the band, exaggerated by touring and health issues, came to a head, and by the time Laying Down the Law was released, the Wreckery had already chosen to split up after a brief tour.\\" During 1988 Casinader shifted over to guitar and keyboards while they added two new members: Brian Colechin on bass guitar (ex- Marching Girls) and John Murphy on drums (ex-News, Whirlywirld, Associates, Slub). After the tour, in mid-1989, the Wreckery disbanded. In August 2008 Casinader and Race reformed the group to release a 2√ó CD album, Past Imperfect, with a tour of the east coast in support.

His imprisonment stemmed in part from his possession of a single American $1 bill.  Career  Golge worked as a full-time NASA contractor on NASA's proposed human mission to Mars, where he researched the effects of solar radiation on astronauts in space. He had graduated from Fatih University in Istanbul and moved to the United States in the early 2000s, where he received his Ph.D. in physics in 2010 from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. Both he and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens the same year. As a dual Turkish-U.S. citizen, Golge lived in a southwest Houston suburb with his wife and two young children.  Imprisonment  On July 23, 2016, as he and his family were ending a month-long vacation with his parents in Turkey‚Äôs southern Hatay province, Golge was arrested by the Turkish government, following a tip from a disgruntled relative who had a dispute with him over a family inheritance, and who allegedly told authorities the scientist was a spy for the CIA. Golge was one of more than 110,000 people, including at least nine American citizens and several U.S. Consulate employees, detained during the post-coup crackdown by the Turkish government in July 2016. His home was searched, and he was charged with participating in terrorism and conspiring against the government as a member of the G√ºlen movement, which Turkey designates the \\"Fethullahist Terrorist Organization\\". As evidence the prosecution presented a $1 bill found in his apartment (similar to many other national security trials in which Turkish prosecutors have cited possession of American dollars as evidence that the accused was linked to the G√ºlen movement), the fact that he had a bank account at a bank linked to G√ºlen supporters and that he had studied at a university linked to the G√ºlen movement. Golge denied being a member of the G√ºlen movement or undertaking any anti-government activities. On February 8, 2018, he was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison, a sentence that was later reduced to 5 years. The government in Ankara believes that the G√ºlen movement is at least partially responsible for the 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt and has arrested many of its members, followers and sympathizers, and suspected sympathizers, members and followers since the coup's failure in July 2016. Suspected conspirators have included judges, academics, and journalists. = Release = After nearly three years of imprisonment, Golge was abruptly released in May 2019 into house arrest. He returned to the United States in June 2020.
